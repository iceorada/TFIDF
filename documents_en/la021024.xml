<LD>"TAXI: An Encounter," a distinctive and engaging debut feature
written, directed and produced by Gabriela David, is screening Sunday
in the American Cinematheque's New Argentine Cinema series that runs
Friday through Sunday at the Egyptian.</LD>
<LD>   What makes this special is not its classic "Brief Encounter" plot,
but David's promising gifts as an expressive screen storyteller.
David has an instinct for where to put the camera and a keen
intuition in using her visual medium in a graceful, fluid style to
convey what her characters are experiencing at every turn.</LD>
<LD>   She is no less skilled with actors, as her stars and supporting
players demonstrate. Diego Peretti has terrific screen presence as
Cat, a garrulous Buenos Aires thief who steals taxis for a chop shop
but can't resist playing cabby for a spell before turning them over.
He's tooling around when the fare he picks up, a pretty girl of
high-school age, proves to be suffering from a gunshot wound. For all
his bravado, Cat makes sure that the girl, Laura (Josefina Viton),
gets emergency treatment.</LD>
<TE>   The point is that Cat and Josefina have connected, and as David
follows their separate lives after that brief, dramatic crossing of
paths, she reveals how they affect each other afterward. The way the
parallel destinies of Cat and the beautiful Laura play out is
unpredictable, eloquent and touching.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Walker's "Devil's Playground,"  one of the strongest films in
the Laemmle Theaters' most recent Documentary Days, will resurface at
the Sunset 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Devil's Playground" is a jolting, poignant eye-opener about the
little-known traditional sojourn Amish youth take in the outside
world before rejoining their church.</TE>
<TE>   The film explores how it affects several individuals from that
strict, sheltered world who are turned loose in today's
temptation-laden society.</TE>

<HD>No tears for Faith Hill as 'Cry' debuts in first place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no reason for Faith Hill to cry this week. Despite some
negative reviews, her "Cry" album entered the national sales chart at
No. 1 on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Warner Bros. release sold 472,000 copies last week to more
than triple the 154,000 total of the week's runner-up, rapper LL Cool
J's new collection, "10." The figure also easily topped the 250,000
first-week sales total of Hill's last album, 1999's "Breathe."</LD>
<LD>   In the new album, the country music star continues her pursuit of
her pop crossover dreams, but often at the expense of human warmth.
Except for the tender "You're Still Here," most of the selections
suffer from vocal histrionics.</LD>
<TE>   In the oldies hits war, Elvis Presley continues to lead the
Rolling Stones. Presley's single disc package, "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits,"
claimed third place on the sales list by selling 143,000 copies last
week. That brings the album's four-week total to 1.2 million. The
Stones' "Forty Licks," a two-disc set, sold 147,000 last week for a
three-week total of 576,000.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hill and LL Cool J, five other artists entered the Top 25
this week, according to Nielsen SoundScan: Gerald Levert (No. 9),
Dave Hollister (No. 10), Fleetwood Mac (a greatest-hits package) (No.
12), Taproot (No. 17) and Tracy Chapman (No. 25).</TE>
<TE>   On the singles chart, "American Idol" winner Kelly Clarkson's
"Before Your Love" is No. 1 for the fifth week.</TE>

<HD>Having a masked ball</HD>
<DH>It's apparent that two welders from Long Beach have a sense
of humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hanging from bridges and buildings just wasn't enough excitement for
a pair of Long Beach welders. Sure, the work was thrilling, but the
gear was anything but. The standard-issue black helmet, in
particular, was far too plain for this pair of tattooed and pierced
30-something thrill seekers.</LD>
<LD>   And so they created Hoodlum Welding--fully functional welding
helmets that look like lions, tigers and, uh, bulldogs, among other
things. Why just weld when you can weld and look like a wild animal?
Why spark a hot rod when you can spark it and look like a razorback
pig?</LD>
<LD>   The two were on to something. Five years after setting up shop,
thousands of their helmets have sold worldwide, mostly to welders and
hot rodders--"young guys with a lot of testosterone," according to
Kevin Coughlin, who owns the firm that makes the helmets.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody kind of looks at it, like, 'Who would buy that?' Then
they say, 'Well, that would be a kind of neat thing to have for
Halloween,' and they end up buying one," said Jack Fazio, branch
manager of Praxair welding supplies in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In the two months Fazio's been on the job, the store has sold two
plain helmets and four of the Hoodlum helmets -- most of them skulls.
The helmets go for $72.95 but safety extras can drive the price as
high as $300.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Larry Patrick opted for the gorilla. He'd just
returned from a gorilla-hunting trip in Belize when he saw the helmet
at a local welding shop. A welder for 27 years, he bought one because
"it's cool." At his job in Victorville, where he works on Caterpillar
land-movers, it gets a lot of laughs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not every job site is so accommodating. Minneapolis, where Hoodlum
Welding is based, banned sewer workers from wearing them. The daily
emergence of skeleton skulls from the sewer system was, apparently,
scaring the locals.</TE>
<TE>   The burning skull is Hoodlum's most popular model with men. The
arctic cat is a favorite with women. In all, the company offers 15
styles, all designed by the Long Beach welders and their business
partner, who have asked to remain unidentified.</TE>
<TE>   The helmets are available online at the Hoodlum web site,
www.hoodlum-welding.com, but most are sold through gas- and
welding-supply distributors because they are designed to be used on
the job. The helmets come with protective lenses and face shields
that can be adapted to hard hats.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Hoodlum has made the world of welding more fashionable,
or, some would say, freaky, one has to wonder what's next.
Custom-painted blowtorches? Gold lame welding suits?</TE>
<TE>   So far, Hoodlum has only ventured into T-shirts and denim work
wear, which aren't anything special. As for new helmets, Coughlin
said, "We've got a new one coming out the second quarter of 2003, but
I can't tell you what it is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Behind the mask</TE>
<TE>   Founded:  Five years ago in frustration by two style-conscious
Long Beach welders.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: About $75 for standard masks, as high as $300 for custom
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Worth noting: Men favor the burning skull model, women the artic
cat.</TE>
<TE>   A cold shoulder: Minneapolis stopped city sewer workers from
wearing them -- the skulls scared the local populace.</TE>

<LD>You may have seen them outside concerts, selling oatmeal cookies and
chocolate raspberry cheesecake, pistachio bread and pear custard tart
-- all of it freshly baked by a local band, Breech.</LD>
<LD>   Word on the street is that Missy Gibson, the group's smoky-voiced
lead singer, has a gift for baking bread. And her guitarist and
accordion player? They make some mean cookies.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, it was bake or bust for the indie rock five-piece.
With not enough money to record a second album, Gibson suggested to
her bandmates that they put on their hot mitts and hit the streets.
Of the $10,000 needed to record "Apron Songs," which is now
available, $7,000 was raised through bake sales.</LD>
<TE>   Today, they continue to push cookies, cakes and bread in hopes
they will pay for future tours and recording projects. At a recent
Bob Dylan show, chocolate-peanut butter bars and other goodies came
with free glasses of milk to anyone who spent $3.</TE>
<TE>   "We could do car washes," Gibson said, "but I'm a really good
baker."</TE>
<TE>   Next bake sale? Outside the Wiltern on Nov. 4 when the Rolling
Stones play.</TE>

<HD>As duo, Underworld passes the live test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the recent release of "A Hundred Days Off," electronic music
heroes Underworld passed part one of the test on how it would fare
without producer-DJ Darren Emerson, who left the group in 1999. Part
two -- how the live show that has ranked right up there with the
Prodigy's in the dance world would manage -- was answered
emphatically Monday at the sold-out Wiltern.</LD>
<LD>   Now a duo, Karl Hyde and Rick Smith opened strongly with the
pulsating "Mo Move," the lead track from the new album. The revamped
lineup worked well on stage, with the duo taking advantage of more
opportunities for interplay and clearer roles in this new setup.
Smith handled the majority of the programming, while Hyde sang and
danced around the stage throughout the two-hour set with the energy
of a disco Mick Jagger.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd responded in kind to his showmanship, greeting the first
break in the music with a deafening ovation that wouldn't have been
out of place at an Angels World Series game.</LD>
<TE>   Like any great live act, Underworld knows how to work a crowd and
feed off it. During "Born Slippy," the band's anthem from the movie
"Trainspotting," the house lights came up to create a moment of
show-stopping frenzy. (In the first dance-music show since its
remodeling, the Wiltern faced its own test, and while the floor was
so packed that there was little room to dance, the large size of the
room created an intensity it's hard to imagine at any dance club in
L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   Musically, the set kept up a blistering pace, relying heavily on
the throbbing keyboard grooves Underworld is known for, with a few
percussive solos mixed in for variety. If Underworld was indeed
trying to make a statement, it came through with the force of a
thousand thundering bass lines.</TE>

<LD>Here's the skinny</LD>
<LD>   Numerous bands are riding the new new wave these days, but few are
as fun as the Von Steins -- a skinny-tied quintet of twentysomethings
from Anaheim. They'd barely made it out of the playpen when the '80s
were in full swing, but their affection for bands like Depeche Mode
and New Order shines on synth-driven pop-punk ditties like "Cosmic"
and "Wavelength." Judging from the group's name, Falco may also have
been an influence. Obsessed with Germany (though they have never
visited), all five of the Von Steins have (unofficially) changed
their surnames to align with the band's moniker. Formed in 1998, the
band recorded an album recently, but contractual difficulties
prevented its release. Still, copies are making the rounds, even
finding their way to KROQ's Rodney Bingenheimer, who's played them on
his show. The group hopes to release an EP in late November. It's
better to see them live anyway (Monday at the Blue Cafe in Long
Beach), and watch the spastic contortionist antics of lead singer
Gunther.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Going for a spin</TE>
<TE>   DJs live the jet-set life today, traveling around the world for
gigs. Several of L.A.'s top spin-meisters are heading to Acapulco for
the ACA World Sound Festival Nov. 1-3. Christopher Lawrence, DJ Dan,
Jason Bentley and Marques Wyatt, as well as fellow Angelenos Beck and
Ozomatli, are among those lending their talents to the event, whose
proceeds benefit the Million Wishes Latin America Charity Fund. L.A.
should be representin' in Acapulco, as the festival is the brainchild
of Angeleno Michael Hahn, who started Penguin's Frozen Yogurt in
L.A., then took his entrepreneurial skills to the world of music. Two
years ago, the event attracted more than 60,000 dance music fans
(last year's event was postponed because of Sept. 11). The highlight?
Maybe the fact that DJ Danny Tenaglia made it at all. Tenaglia got
lost between Mexico City and Acapulco, and spent 12 hours on a bus,
before finally taking the stage with friend Carl Cox. The two
embraced and spun on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a dye job</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the sake, that was Ward Dotson on keyboards last weekend
at Zen Sushi. The Liquor Giants frontman is the latest addition to

<LD>The audience had the answer</LD>
<LD>   In his hallucinogen-fueled, five-year quest for spiritual truth,
Daniel Pinchbeck saw a conga line of elves after ingesting psilocybin
mushrooms and felt as if he was followed by a sneering hipster after
taking DPT. Both were part of his journey from agnostic New York
intellectual to shamanic newbie, a path he detailed during a recent
reading for his book "Breaking Open the Head" (Broadway Books).</LD>
<LD>   About a dozen people and one dog squeezed into a cramped space at
the Book Soup Addendum in West Hollywood last week to hear all about
it. Most of them--dog excepted--had the aura of having done more than
a little experimentation themselves. The 36-year-old author--blond,
bearded and wearing an ill-fitting, blue velvet suit -- kicked off
the night with a reading about an Ecuadorean ayahuasca ceremony. The
night got even more interesting after he closed the book and opened
the floor to a heady discussion that began with the question, "Why
are so many experiences on ayahuasca post-apocalyptic?" and ended
when someone asked where it was possible to find the drug.</LD>
<TE>   Before Pinchbeck could answer, he was cut off by several
attendees, all of whom volunteered: "On Melrose."</TE>
<TE>   -- Susan Carpenter</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The next 'Corrections'?</TE>
<TE>   It's got one of the least conventional narrators in current
fiction -- an irreverent hermaphrodite from an inbred Greek family.
But "Middlesex" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), the new novel by Jeffrey
Eugenides, could have the same kind of broad appeal "The Corrections"
showed last year. Like Jonathan Franzen's novel, "Middlesex" is a
critics' darling that combines a knowing, ironic tone and postmodern
trickery with the heft of an old-fashioned social novel.</TE>
<TE>   Eugenides appeared at Los Feliz's Skylight Books on Sunday night,
greeted by a packed, wide-ranging crowd that chose to miss the second
game of the World Series. "It's like a nightclub in here," one young
man in dreadlocks said to a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The author, a charming, intelligent and severely balding presence
best known for "The Virgin Suicides," read from two passages. One
recounted the narrator's complicated baptism, which Eugenides
rendered with a perfect Greek accent, the second a scene in which the
character's grandfather, then a young man, begins an ill-fated job at
the Ford Motor Co. (The book, which Eugenides dubs a "comic epic,"
takes such a long view that its protagonist is not born until Page
215.) After the brief reading, Eugenides answered questions from the
crowd, describing the book's nine troubled years of gestation; his
Herculean amount of research on sexuality, 1920s Asia Minor, and '60s
Detroit; and his interest in making his hermaphrodite seem like "a
real person," not an isolated or a mythical figure. Eugenides says he
tackled the character as a Method actor would, trying to imagine
himself in a sexually ambiguous body. In fact, Callie Stephanides,
his narrator, possesses a biography eerily similar to the author.</TE>

<TE>   Once a hacker, now an author</TE>
<TE>   Breezing into the room with a box of books and a bulging
over-the-shoulder bag, Kevin Mitnick stepped up to the microphone:
"How many FBI agents are in the audience tonight?"</TE>
<TE>   The country's most notorious computer hacker drew polite laughter
as he peered at the room -- a filled-to-the-gills alcove at Barnes &amp;
Noble in Santa Monica, where he discussed "The Art of Deception"
(John Wiley &amp; Sons), his consumer-protection guide to
computer-vandalism techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "How many computer hackers are here?"</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the 150 or so computer nerds and curiosity seekers
who packed the house earlier this month were bold enough to raise
their hands. Mitnick, after all, was in a league of his own -- a
hacker who was once on the FBI's most wanted list and served five
years in prison for repeatedly breaking into corporate computers.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two years after his release, Mitnick is retired from the
nefarious world of illegal computer trickery.</TE>
<TE>   After introducing the audience to some basic infiltration
techniques, he opened the floor and was flooded with questions on
everything from topic including how to choose a password
(consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel) what he thought of the Mitnick
biopic "Takedown" (it was "crap") and how he spent his time during
eight months of solitary confinement (reading law books).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Chamber Music's 16th season began Tuesday night in Zipper
Concert Hall at downtown Los Angeles' Colburn School of Performing
Arts with a bracing agenda of unhackneyed works by Wagner, Elgar and
Richard Strauss. It was the first of four "Autumn Twilight" programs
that the group will perform through Nov. 12.</LD>
<LD>   This quartet of concerts surveys a familiar period -- from 1875 to
1918, the end of the Romantic period and the opening of a new century
-- with new perspectives and unusual music choices. Some of these
were outlined in the pre-concert discussion founding artistic
director Jeff von der Schmidt had with musicians Natalie Limonick and
Mark Menzies; they were made clearer with the polished performances
that followed.</LD>
<LD>   Gayle Blankenburg first played Wagner's "The Arrival of the Black
Swans," an affecting, brief piano piece based on a phrase from a
"Tannhauser" aria. Then, joined by the Southwest's resident string
quartet -- violinists Menzies and Johnny Chang, violist Jan Karlin
and cellist Paula Fehrenbach -- Blankenburg was the protagonist in
Edward Elgar's Piano Quintet in A minor from 1919. It was dedicated
to the memory of Mehli Mehta.</LD>
<TE>   The performance emerged passionate and touching; particularly
moving was the central, noble Adagio. The extended finale tended to
dawdle rather than push ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The high point of the evening was the revival of Strauss'
melodrama "Enoch Arden," for speaker and piano, in this case
Blankenburg and her husband, Heinz, an international operatic figure
now retired.</TE>
<TE>   Together, these artists held the Southwest audience tightly in the
dramatic grip of the Tennyson epic. They did so without
overperforming or exaggeration but by giving the words and the
musical continuity the respect of clear statement and sensitive
timing. It was one of the more satisfying hours Southwest Chamber
Music has given us.</TE>

<LD>A burly guy in denim shirt and matching denim apron prowls the room,
holding up a round object wrapped in foil.</LD>
<LD>   "Got that?" he says. "Great Hill Blue is made from unpasteurized
raw cow's milk from Massachusetts. The St. Agur is also cow's milk,
just like Fourme d'Ambert, but this one has 60% or higher butterfat."
Groans from those of us who have zeroed in on this delicious blue,
polishing it off before the rest of the cheeses on Plate 2.</LD>
<LD>   The 40 or so participants seated at tables covered in green and
white tablecloths scribble notes, taste and hold out their glasses
for the next wine. "Boys and girls, remember Chateauneuf always has
the embossed keys on the bottle," our instructor, Tony, cajoles as we
try the 1999 Chateauneuf against a 1989 Cornas.</LD>
<TE>   At the beginning of the evening, the mood is impressively serious.
One hour in, it has degenerated into boisterous, and I'm sure
everyone dutifully eating their skinless chicken at Koo Koo Roo on
Beverly Drive is wondering what's going on in that back garden room.
Whatever it is, they must think, it sounds like fun.</TE>
<TE>   This Koo Koo Roo is where the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills, the
impressively well-stocked shop a few doors up the street, holds a
series of informal wine and cheese evenings two or three times a
month. This one, on a Wednesday night, is already sold out when a
place opens up at a friend's table. I'm in luck.</TE>
<TE>   Each tasting is themed, and the one I happen to be attending is
"Rhone Wines and Blue Cheeses" ($35 per person). It didn't take much
persuading to get me here to try 10 different blues and seven wines.
It's a relaxed and unintimidating way to learn more about both wine
and cheese. Not to mention fun.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the discovery of the evening is a gentle, crumbly cow's
milk cheese from the Savoie called Bleu de Termignon, and the two
American blues. That salty, smelly one from Old Chatham in
upper-state New York holds its own against Roquefort.</TE>
<TE>   The wine this evening is from Beaune Imports. And to finish things
off, owner Norbert Wabnig and company have boiled red potatoes in
their skins and served them with a slice of French ham, cornichons
and a sauce made from four or five blues, creme fraiche and "another
pound of butter." We pretend we didn't hear that last part.</TE>
<TE>   At 9, those enthusiasts who wish to continue can enjoy a 10%
discount on everything at the Cheese Store up the block.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next tasting</TE>
<TE>   The next event for the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills will be a
"Holiday Spectacular" at which Champagnes, Ports, Sauternes, caviar,
foie gras, smoked salmon and cheese will be tasted ($60). It will be
held at Hermes in Beverly Hills on Nov. 18 to 20. The tastings skip
December, but for January's schedule, call the shop at (310)
278-2855. Reservations are essential.</TE>

<TE>   The stylish brunet with the ice blue eyes slid her mini-skirted
derriere onto a stool and leaned into the bartender, "Whaddaya got
that's blue?" It's not that she's got a jones for curacao, it's that
the brunet, my sister Lorraine, thinks drinks should not only taste
good, but make you look good when you sip them. So, the Blue Moon
Martini gets her stamp of approval. The sweetness of blue curacao
does a balancing act against the tartness of a splash of lemonade
while a shot of vodka gives them both a little sting. It also looks
sleek in your hand, served straight up, after the bartender strains
it into a martini glass and adds a curly lemon twist.</TE>

<LD>Splendora, an online guide to excellence, lists Roscoe's Chicken and
Waffles Hollywood under the subhead: Splendid Sins. The sin? Nearly
everything on the menu. Celebrities and locals keep the location on
Gower Street in Hollywood packed. On weekends, the waiting line can
stretch halfway down the block. Manning the door: Rahman Muhammad.</LD>
<LD>   The back story</LD>
<LD>   The 49-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer says that Muhammad Ali
is his idol, photography his avocation and poetry his mission.
Originally from Atlanta, Muhammad has been at Roscoe's since 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Style</TE>
<TE>   He won't be caught without one of his trademark stingy-brimmed
Kangol hats. Muhammad might wear a suit, an African robe or go
totally casual, but whatever the outfit, "I like to be cool, calm and
collected -- always coordinated."</TE>
<TE>   Extras</TE>
<TE>   If you're lucky, he'll share a line of his original poetry: "I
like to say I went from fighting to writing."</TE>
<TE>   Work strategies</TE>
<TE>   "When people get impatient, I use a little humor -- I'll call them
over and say, 'You've got five seconds to give me the name of the
little statue they give out at the Academy Awards!' And the guy's
name is Oscar. So he shouts: 'Oscar!' I tell him, 'It's you, man.
Come on in.' And he and everybody that's waiting in line cracks up
laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Confession</TE>
<TE>   "When celebrities or one of my regular customers comes up, I just
say, 'Hi, whoever, takeout order is ready!' They go in and sit down,
and it doesn't make the people in line feel bad."</TE>
<TE>   Best perk</TE>

celebrities that I admire."</TE>

<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran playwright John O'Keefe takes a largely forgotten tragedy of
the Holocaust and exploits it to devastating effect in "Times Like
These," a Padua Playwrights production at 2100 Square Feet.</LD>
<LD>   O'Keefe, who also directs, loosely bases his play on the real-life
story of Meta Wolff and Joachim Gottschalk, married actors crushed
under the juggernaut of the Third Reich. An idol of stage and film,
the Aryan Gottschalk was threatened with dire consequences unless he
separated from his Jewish wife, Wolff. But the night before Wolff and
their only child were to be deported to Theresienstadt, the entire
family committed suicide -- an event hushed up by the Nazis, who
feared public riots if the news leaked out.</LD>
<LD>   Laurie O'Brien plays Meta Wolff, while Norbert Weisser is Oskar
Weiss, the star-crossed lovers of O'Keefe's two-person drama. O'Keefe
has eliminated the ill-fated child, preferring to concentrate solely
on the intense private world of his protagonists, bright and
privileged artists whose cozy marital microcosm implodes with
Hitler's ascension to power.</LD>
<TE>   Set in Berlin, 1939, the action unfolds in a series of terse
blackouts. In the opening scene, we see Meta, transcendent after her
latest stage triumph, with Oskar fawning at her feet in adulation.
Here, it is the celebrated Meta -- the luminous O'Brien, in a
wrenching, authoritative turn -- who rules the marital roost. Oskar,
portrayed with equal heft and authority by Weisser, is very much the
lesser personage, still struggling for his place in Meta's reflected
limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it is the rise of the Nazis that provides Oskar with
his big break. Cast as Hamlet, Oskar follows Meta's suggestion and
covertly transforms his Dane into a Nazi thug. It's a brilliant,
dangerous interpretation that, for the hitherto bland Oskar, is an
artistic validation -- and a terrifying hint at the monster lurking
inside him.</TE>
<TE>   Oskar's metamorphosis -- from nice guy to beast and back again --
speaks volumes about the human capacity for good and evil, that
inborn pendulum swinging inside of every individual that can so
easily overbalance conscience. Equally stunning is Meta's pitiable
progression from undisputed queen of German cafe society to a
cowering, terrified prisoner in her own home. Of course, it is these
characters' love for one another that rights the pendulum and
ennobles their plight. In O'Brien and Weisser's skillful hands,
O'Keefe's beautifully balanced piece reverberates with terror,
humanity and hope.</TE>

<LD>JAZZ</LD>
<LD>   Attached to Satchmo</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Payton reminds a lot of people of the great Louis
Armstrong -- and Payton doesn't mind the association. In 2001, the
27-year-old recorded his Grammy-nominated CD, "Dear Louis," in which
he reinvented some of Armstrong's signature tunes in his own
contemporary style. Like the legendary Satchmo, Payton grew up in New
Orleans. The young trumpeter studied with Ellis Marsalis, the father
of Branford and Wynton and the teacher of such other jazz greats as
trumpeter Terence Blanchard, saxophonist Donald Harrison and pianist
Harry Connick Jr. Southlanders have five chances to hear this young
master this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Nicholas Payton, the Neurosciences Institute, 10640 John Jay
Hopkins Drive, San Diego. Thursday, 8 p.m. $21 to $24. (858)
454-5872. Also, Friday and Saturday, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Founders
Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center
Drive, Costa Mesa. $48 to $52. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<TE>   DANCE</TE>
<TE>   Scored for four violins, four engines</TE>
<TE>   Angelin Preljocaj dances where other choreographers fear to tread.
In the past, the controversial head of France's Ballet Preljocaj has
brought local audiences a dance drama suggesting that the Virgin Mary
wasn't exactly happy about the Annunciation, a dark interpretation of
"Romeo and Juliet" depicting war between the homeless and a fascistic
police state, plus radical remakes of vintage Ballets Russes
classics. This time, he dares to take on Karlheinz Stockhausen's
"Helikopter Quartet," a score for four violins and four helicopter
engines (recorded in flight), and the monumental "Rite of Spring" by
Igor Stravinsky. He sees the latter work as portraying "a slowly
rising force of desire and at the same time a kind of controlled
panic." So expect full-frontal nudity and the spectacular intensity
for which his dancers are famed.</TE>
<TE>   Ballet Preljocaj, Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive,
Irvine. Friday, 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 8 p.m. $32 to $38. (949)
854-4646.</TE>

loveless marriage gets an unexpected kick-start when tragedy strikes.
Timothy Spall, Lesley Manville, Alison Garland, James Corden and Ruth
Sheen head the ensemble cast.</TE>
<TE>   "All or Nothing," rated R for sexual content and language, opens
Friday in selected theaters.</TE>

<TE>   Paul McCartney swings back through the Southland on the second leg
of his "Back in the U.S." tour, landing at the Arrowhead Pond in
Anaheim on Friday and then Staples Center on Monday. His show last
spring in Los Angeles was more celebratory and poignant than even
many longtime fans had expected as he coursed through three-dozen
songs spanning his years in the Fab Four, including warm remembrances
of John Lennon and George Harrison, and the many hits from his
post-Beatles solo career. A two-CD live album and a DVD from the tour
are due Nov. 26, but don't miss the real thing.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Rooftop waterbeds and Jetsons decor caught the attention of the
arbiters of design when they anointed hotelier Andre Balazs with this
year's Design Patron award, as part of the Smithsonian's prestigious
National Design Awards announced Tuesday night at the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum in New York. Balazs' hotels include Los Angeles' Standard
Downtown, a former office building turned hipster haunt by the Santa
Monica architecture firm of Koning Eizenberg last summer. He also
revived the down-and-out Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip into a
celebrity favorite, turned a nearby bland '60s building into the
Standard and transformed a 19th century SoHo warehouse into the
Mercer Hotel in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "We've tried to create unique places which capture the spirit of
the geographic location and the audience it's addressing," Balazs
said Wednesday from New York. Using a different designer for each
project is "more difficult, but worth the effort."</LD>
<LD>   This year's Lifetime Achievement award went to landscape architect
Dan Kiley, whose designs deftly merge building and site at some of
the nation's best-known civic spaces, including New York's Lincoln
Center, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the New
York Botanical Gardens. Kiley also was awarded the National Medal of
Arts by President Clinton in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Steven Holl, winner in the category of architecture design, is
working on a new home for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County. The project's scheme, combining new construction with
restoration and seismic retrofit of some of the existing structures,
will be unveiled sometime in 2003. The New York-based architect said
Wednesday that the Los Angeles museum is "my biggest project on the
horizon right now." He is best known for his Chapel of St. Ignatius
in Seattle and Kiasma, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners include fashion designer Geoffrey Beene, named an
"American Original"; the Whirlpool Corp. for corporate achievement;
Lucille Tenazas for communications design; James Carpenter for
environment design; and Niels Diffrient for product design.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander placed second to Joshua Redman in
the 1991 Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition. Since
then, he seems to have spent much of his time in the recording
studios, releasing more than twice as many albums as Redman during
the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   But most have received relatively scant notice among the broader
jazz audience, despite a widely held view that Alexander has the
talent to rise to the top level of the crowded list of jazz tenor
saxophonists.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the reasons for the slow ascension were on display Tuesday
at the Jazz Bakery in the opening set of a six-night run. Alexander
made it instantly and continuously apparent, from his first note to
his last, that he is a masterful -- even virtuosic -- saxophone
artist. Whether playing ballads such as the rarely heard "Maybe
September," a grooving middle-tempo rendering of "The Sweetest Sounds
I've Ever Heard," a high-speed romp through "The End of a Love
Affair," or a simple, straight-ahead blues, he rarely paused for more
than a heartbeat on any single note. Even in "Maybe September," which
he began promisingly with a dark-toned fragment reminiscent of
Coleman Hawkins, he quickly abandoned any pretense of melodic
paraphrase or of remaining in touch at all with the original tune, in
favor of pouring out torrents of horn-scouring notes.</LD>
<TE>   Although there was unquestioned fascination in hearing such an
extraordinary technical display, after the first rush of admiration
for Alexander's sheer physicality, his soloing tended to reproduce
the quality of watching a video in fast forward. As fascinating as
some of his musical images may have been, his failure to allow them
the time and opportunity to emerge and breathe naturally, to keep in
mind that music consists of both sound and silences, tended to
seriously undercut the effectiveness of his playing.</TE>
<TE>   At 34, he obviously has the musical dexterity to be grouped with
saxophonists such as Redman and Chris Potter. But first he'll have to
slow down his fingers and decide what it is he wants to say
musically.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, one might have thought that the presence of veteran
pianist Harold Mabern, Alexander's former teacher, would have
prompted a more reasoned approach to some of the tunes. But there was
surprisingly little connection between their soloing -- Mabern's
two-handed, thick-chorded, hard-bop swinging and Alexander's
racehorse romping. Nor was either particularly well aided by the
passive bass playing of Michael Zissman and the robotic cymbal work
of drummer Joe Farnsworth.</TE>

<LD>Every dog will have its day -- even a bionic mutt named McGrowl, the
furry brainchild of neophyte children's book author Bob Balaban.</LD>
<LD>   "McGrowl: Beware of Dog," the first in a series of six "McGrowl"
books to be published by Scholastic Inc., is just one more creative
hat for the bespectacled Balaban. A familiar character actor, he's
also a director -- currently of the off-Broadway hit "The Exonerated"
-- and a producer, including the Oscar-nominated film "Gosford Park."</LD>
<LD>   Now Balaban is spinning tales about a canine super-sleuth and two
kid sidekicks, whose adventures are filled with giggles, eerie
trouble and the distinctive scent of dog.</LD>
<TE>   "It's sort of Tom Sawyer meets Tim Burton," Balaban said. "It's
set in pleasant middle America, but with a force of evil in the town
-- an evil man and woman who take on a different disguise in every
book. But at the end of every one, the dog and the kids save the
day."</TE>
<TE>   Balaban is drawing on his theatrical roots for his Storyopolis
appearance. He'll perform in classic radio theater-style with
celebrities Teri Garr, Ed Begley Jr., Jennifer Coolidge and Colleen
Camp. And in old-time radio serial fashion, the performance will end
with a cliffhanger.</TE>
<TE>   Balaban has movie plans for the book too; meanwhile, the next
adventures are due out in January and next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I've gotten to know these characters," he says, "I can't
wait to get to them again."</TE>

<HD>The revealing mask</HD>
<DH>The ever-enigmatic Residents can teach us something about
identity and culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best Halloween costume is the one you can see through. By that I
mean that you can tell, maybe after a double take, who it is
underneath. "Oh, it's Betty being an alien stripper."</LD>
<LD>   I have made the mistake of being too opaque. A couple years back I
went to an Oct. 31 party wearing an evil pumpkin head, a globe of
orange rubber with a smile intimating criminal madness. Only my eyes
were visible. I was instantly the most hated person at the party. The
bearded guy whose jumpsuit bore the word "Unabomber" was in poorer
taste, and there was one completely naked man (OK, he had running
shoes on). But even my close friends were driven to great anxiety at
not being able to see my face. Finally, they were drunk and
threatened to remove the pumpkin head by violence.</LD>
<LD>   Their irrational fear filled me with a feeling of immense power.
My anonymity became a challenge. I fed on their morbid thoughts. "I
can't even look at you," said a friend, "because I'm imagining you're
smiling that same creepy smile underneath." I grew outraged that
they'd turned me into a stranger, and an untrustworthy one at that. I
began questioning the basis of all my friendships. Were they all
about faces? Wouldn't they let me be whomever I wanted for one night
of fun? If your friends won't hang with you when you're an evil
pumpkin head, who will?</LD>
<TE>   The Residents, on the other hand, have spent the last 30 years
being opaque -- and embraced. Ciphers in the world of pop music, the
band performs only in identity-obliterating masks, outsize headgear
in the shape of giant eyeballs and skulls. Unlike KISS, they have
never been photographed out of costume; indeed, the Residents may
change personnel all the time and no one would know. They may be a
one-man band, like the Monkees. There may be no Residents at all.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing that is certain about the Residents: They make
creepy, brilliantly stressful music. Their early-'70s video work,
including "Third Reich 'n' Roll," is part of the permanent collection
of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The Residents' 1979 LP,
"Eskimo," is one of the most important recordings ever made, a
collection of warbling synth anxiety that's more human than Kraftwerk
but as psychotic as Throbbing Gristle's "Hamburger Lady." "Duck Stab"
is the great 1977 new wave album that Devo didn't dare to make
because the album lacked any irony whatsoever. Their 2002 disc,
"Demons Dance Alone," is similarly quavering and depraved.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it is ironic. Who knows? Without faces, it's impossible
to tell. And in this way, the Residents reveal the lie in all of pop
culture -- indeed, in life itself: Despite their compelling music,
the Residents will never be popular because we only anoint with
celebrity those we think we know. Stars buy our adulation by letting
us into their lives. They become our false friends. But how much do
we really know by seeing them on "MTV Cribs"? What if the Residents
were on there -- a bunch of silent characters in skull and eyeball
heads? It could really be them, but you wouldn't even care.</TE>
<TE>   The Residents have pulled off what no one else has since the
Unknown Comic: greatness without a face.</TE>
<TE>   I left that party, and everyone was relieved. I drifted up
Speedway in Venice Beach, still in my mask. After a while, a guy
yelled down to me from a balcony: "Mike! Mike! Come back up here,
man!" He was talking to the wrong guy, but I went up to his party
anyway. At least he was talking to the real me.</TE>

<HD>A horse? Of course!</HD>
<DH>Children as young as 6 can enjoy riding at the L.A.
Equestrian Center. Their parents are welcome, too.</DH>

<LD>Ride 'em, family!</LD>
<LD>   Oh, think not? Think that only jockeys, rodeo circuit riders,
farmers, ranchers and the aristocracy go horseback riding? Well, a
good ride is no farther away than the Los Angeles Equestrian Center
in the Griffith Park area. And, yes, both children and adults can
have a great time on the first ride over the trails through the
chaparral-covered hills.</LD>
<LD>   It requires no prior knowledge of riding or horses; it doesn't
even require a great deal of balance or nerve. Just grab a pair of
sturdy shoes and head for the Equestrian Center and Griffith Park
Horse Rentals, or another horse rental center around the region.</LD>
<TE>   The , Equestrian Center, whose entrance is on Riverside Drive in
Burbank, is a huge complex that regularly plays host to equestrian
shows and rodeos. It's also home to the Traditional Riding School.
Both the riding school and rental stable are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a family-friendly experience," says Griffith Park Horse
Rentals owner Lydia Doherty. "It's safe for all levels of rider, from
beginners to the experienced rider." Doherty and a crew of trained
guides take riders who are at least 4 feet tall and 6 years old on
trails that wind through the park.</TE>
<TE>   Guide Ricardo Mora has been riding since he was 8. Later on, he
"rode the bulls in the rodeo, until I was gored." These days, he
loves introducing young people to horseback riding. "When they come,
some are a little afraid, but I tell them: 'Don't worry,' " Mora
says. "And I show them the horse is calm. It's not going to run."</TE>
<TE>   Mora smiles and looks out over the string of 24 horses. "Horses
are very smart, you know. They feel it -- if there is a child on
their back, they will be very gentle."</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. I've been riding since I was 4," says 9-year-old
Natasha Zabolotskaia, a frequent visitor. Natasha's mother,
Anastasia, is just as enthusiastic. "It's good for the kids; they're
outdoors and they learn how to control this powerful animal."</TE>
<TE>   Mora saddles a mount for Natasha, who steps up onto the children's
mounting platform. This is the only stable in the area that allows
children to ride, so it is outfitted with small saddles, and the
guides adjust the stirrups for children.</TE>
<TE>   As he adjusts the saddle for Natasha, Mora details the safety
rules: "There is no galloping. No sandals. And riders under 18 must
wear a helmet."</TE>
<TE>   Natasha can barely contain her enthusiasm as she shares what she's
learned about horses: "The saddles weigh more than 100 pounds," she
warns. "So if you lean over like this" -- she tilts sideways -- "that
adds 30 pounds to the weight the horse has to carry."</TE>
<TE>   Natasha's smile breaks into giggles as she takes the reins and
follows her guide onto the trail. The stable regular turns back to
add, "I like riding Shenandoah." Like many riders, she has become
attached to a particular horse.</TE>
<TE>   Guides like Mora know every horse's name, age and background. Mora
points out the animals in one of the corrals. "There's Cisco, Austin,
Star, Slick, White Cloud...."</TE>
<TE>   The stable is open seven days a week, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
year-round. There are no reservations, except for group events, so
it's first-come, first-served.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, someplace along the path, even a tenderfoot can imagine
that the family is riding the very trails where some of films'
earliest stars -- movie cowboys -- rode off into Hollywood western
history. *</TE>

<LD>As happy as I was to see the L.A. Times overcome its long-standing
bias against country music ("City souls, country hearts," Oct. 17), I
was disappointed to find that writer Jessica Hundley seems to believe
that the Valley sound or the Topanga sound constitutes all that is
new or exciting in Cali-country.</LD>
<LD>   It is unfortunate that Hundley seems to be unable to travel any
farther from the Valley than Glendale to discover that country music
was the most eclectic music on the planet long before Gram Parsons
arrived on the scene and the music continues to be, long after his
unfortunate passing.</LD>
<LD>   While I certainly mean no disrespect to the fine bands she
portrayed in her article, other bands such as Pacific Ryder, Killin
Time, the Doo Wah Riders and High Rider consistently draw close to
1,000 hard-core followers.</LD>

<TE>   As a member of a Cali-country band (Neon Blue), I'm happy to see
some attention given to the cause, especially if it helps persuade
more L.A. clubs to book bands that play this music. Believe me, it's
not easy.</TE>
<TE>   One thing, though: Your model on the cover is "playing" his Fender
Telecaster upside-down. And by the looks of the "chord" he's
strumming, it's a good thing he's not plugged in.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gase</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   Editor's note: In response to many comments about the cover,
Austin Hanks is not a model but a left-handed singer-songwriter who
plays his Telecaster upside-down, much as Jimi Hendrix did years ago.</TE>

<LD>It's possible to be transported far from the city just by going to
dinner. At these restaurants, listen to the rhythmic pounding of the
surf, gaze overhead at leafy trees or enjoy the serenity of a garden.
The city's hustle and bustle will just melt away ... until you get on
the freeway to go home.</LD>
<LD>   Splashes: This restaurant, in a lovely beachfront hotel, has a
patio on the beach that looks toward Catalina. Try it or an indoor
window seat for sunsets. Menu favorites include the spicy fried
calamari and the creme brulee trio: chocolate, vanilla and raspberry.
(Dinner entrees, $8 to $34; prix-fixe dinner, $66; spicy fried
calamari, $10; creme brulee trio, $8.) Splashes, Surf &amp; Sand Hotel,

<HD>Women directors give themselves a break</HD>
<DH>The group Girls Reeling It Together offers support and
screenings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quick: Name five female directors. Now name five more. If you can't
think of one, let alone a handful, don't beat yourself up. Women
directors are a minority, having directed only 6% of last year's 250
top-grossing films.</LD>
<LD>   Yeah, yeah. Whine, sob, sniffle. You've heard this one
before--women just aren't taken seriously in Hollywood. Why should
anyone care?</LD>
<LD>   Because they're getting gypped, that's why. Moviegoers may not
realize it, but fewer women directors mean fewer viewpoints, and
fewer viewpoints mean less diversity in storytelling and less choice
at the box office.</LD>
<TE>   That's part of the reason Shawn Tolleson gathered up her friends
and formed GRIT -- Girls Reeling It Together. The collective of five
independent female directors is screening three of their films this
evening to raise awareness of the problem and, of course, promote
their work.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was living 30 years ago, I probably wouldn't even be
considering being a director," said Tolleson, who wouldn't give her
age. "I'm grateful that I can even consider this career right now,
but there's a lot further to go."</TE>
<TE>   When Tolleson, who lives in L.A., formed GRIT in 1999, she had
just finished "Hide and Seek" -- a black-and-white short about a man
who comes to L.A. to find his sister and discovers she's a
prostitute. Although proud of her accomplishment, Tolleson was
frustrated to have worked so hard only to wait for someone to give
her permission to show it at a film fest. She called all the female
directors she knew -- all four of them -- and put together "the
Lilith Fair of short films." Subsequent GRIT films have gone on to
play at RESFEST Digital Film Festival, South by Southwest, even
Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's screening is GRIT's second and will be hosted by "Shrek"
co-director Vicky Jenson. Its offerings include "Zenith," a
full-length feature about a Kansas farming community staging a
Passion play; "Missed," a short film about a man who loses his
daughter to child services when he's sent to prison for a fatal bar
fight; and "The Cone," a short that follows a traffic cone's
inadvertent travels.</TE>
<TE>   Although directed by women, the three movies are hardly chick
flicks. GRIT is not the Lifetime channel. The themes are not
gender-specific. It's about quality storytelling, whatever the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take the temperature in Hollywood, it's not like
everyone's satisfied with films -- that they're delving into
interesting subjects and doing it well," said Genevieve Anderson, 33,
who directed "The Cone." "Everybody's complaining about how bad
movies are, and yet they keep being made."</TE>
<TE>   Have you seen the film about the guy and girl who hate each other
and end up falling in love? How about that one where the underdog
with a chip on his shoulder grabs a gun and gets the girl?</TE>
<TE>   Exactly.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we have such bad storytelling in indie films is
because it's white men under 25 writing these scripts, and those guys
have grown up playing Nintendo," says Kirsten Tretbar, a GRIT member
whose film "Zenith" will air on NBC next spring. "One of the reasons
I want to encourage women to write and direct films is they have a
different take on life than men."</TE>
<TE>   GRIT isn't alone in its mission. Other industry organizations --
CineWomen, Women in Film, Step Up, even the Directors Guild of
America -- are interested in the same goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild has been working on the problem for a "very
long time," President Martha Coolidge said.</TE>
<TE>   It has screened films by women, helped finance their films and
mentored them, but progress is slow.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes the industry could be embarrassed into nudging the
numbers upward, the guild released statistics last spring that showed
how few women were directing prime-time television series. In the
2000-01 season, only 7% of the top 40 series were directed by women.
As for the number of women directing "humongous-budget" pictures,
Coolidge said, "we can count them on one hand."</TE>
<TE>   Whether GRIT can help to change that remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to create a group that gets the word out to other
women in the industry that if we can do it, they can do it," said
Tretbar, 36, who joined GRIT this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's support each other. Let's show our films. These are good
films. They deserve to be seen. Let's use the fact that we're women
as a starting point."</TE>

<HD>Siqueiros mural reemerges</HD>
<DH>The Mexican artist's Olvera Street painting is being
readied for display after years of conservation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't hold your breath, but the 33-year effort to return "America
Tropical" -- Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros' mural on Olvera
Street -- to public view appears to be entering its final phase. The
badly faded 80-by-18-foot painting, which has been under
conservators' care behind a wooden structure for many years, is being
readied for a permanent display that will allow the public to see
what's left of the once vibrant artwork.</LD>
<LD>   The old wooden covering was removed Monday, in preparation for
construction of a new shelter and public viewing platform. Building
materials are scheduled for delivery Friday, and construction is
expected to begin by the first of the month.</LD>
<LD>   "It will open in 2004," said Kristin Kelly, head of public
programs and communications at the Getty Conservation Institute,
which has played a leading role in the project.</LD>
<TE>   What has so far emerged from under wraps is a ghostly image. In
keeping with current conservation practices, the monumental painting
has been stabilized, cleaned and conserved but not restored to its
original intensity. Visitors will be able to compare the remains of
the mural to a vividly colored reproduction of the original, to be
installed near the painting when the viewing platform is complete.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the mural to the public will end a saga that began
in 1932 when Siqueiros started painting on the second floor of
Italian Hall, overlooking a rooftop beer garden. The central image of
a crucified Indian peon, topped by an American eagle, so offended
some city officials that it soon disappeared from view. A section
that could be seen from street level was painted over first. Then the
rest was whitewashed, and the mural was left to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   A drive to save "America Tropical" began in 1969, but it didn't
get going in earnest until 1987, when the Getty Conservation
Institute joined forces with El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical
Monument, the city department that administers the historic site. The
$4.5-million project secured major funding from the J. Paul Getty
Trust, with additional contributions from the city, the National
Endowment for the Arts and local foundations. Even with all that
support, the project has been repeatedly delayed by bureaucratic
procedures, personnel changes and technical complications.</TE>
<TE>   What conservators found once they were able to work on the mural
was that Siqueiros' methods only added to the painting's decay. It is
believed that he laid out the composition in fresco, achieving a
stained effect as he applied pigment to wet plaster, and then added
details and broad swaths of color to the dry surface, said Leslie
Rainer, a wall paintings conservator and senior project specialist at
the Getty Conservation Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Questions remain about his materials. Paint losses indicate that
the top coats of paint didn't effectively adhere to the fresco layer.
The paint, including automotive materials, also faded quickly. In
fact, the section that was whitewashed shortly after the mural was
finished is better preserved than the rest. Metal doors covering two
windows in the brick wall behind the mural were integrated into
Siqueiros' composition, but they now stand out as dark rectangles.</TE>
<TE>   The next step in recovering "America Tropical" is protecting it
during construction of the viewing platform, said Kevin Marshall,
lead preparator at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Charged with designing a
rigid, lightweight cover that would extend no more than 8 inches in
front of the mural, he came up with an aluminum truss system that
supports panels of Lexan -- a fluted thermal plastic sheeting used
for greenhouses. The panels will be lined with foam, in case of
impact during construction, while a space between the foam and the
mural will allow air circulation and prevent heat buildup, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the new cover is in place, work on the viewing platform will
begin. The plans call for visitors to enter the site through
Sepulveda House, where an exhibition on the mural will be installed,
just south of Italian Hall. Then they will take an elevator or stairs
to the roof and cross a bridge onto the platform. Set back about 40
feet from the mural, the canopied platform will offer a full view of
the painting while protecting it from those who might be tempted to
touch.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a mural where the whole is far greater than the sum of
its parts," Kelly said. "The ability to see the whole thing really
makes it."</TE>
<TE>   But is the mural likely to deteriorate further after it goes on
view?</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken every precaution to guard against that," Rainer said.</TE>

<LD>A set of new blue doors on Hollywood Boulevard opens to Tinseltown's
largest nightclub, a New York-meets-Miami-style dance hall where
revelers can party in a soaring loft interior with exposed red brick
and steel -- or retreat to cozy, blue-glass towers or a sexy orange
room for intimacy and seclusion. Ivar opened a month ago and is
already a star-powered hot spot.</LD>
<LD>   With its an industrial-futuristic look, 25-foot ceilings, five
bars, two DJ booths and a stage area for live alternative-music
performances, Ivar offers club-goers the opportunity to "club hop
within the club," said co-owner Alan Nathan, who also co-owns the
6-month-old Nacional lounge in Hollywood, and Tengu, an Asian-fusion
restaurant in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted it to be modular so that it feels as if there are
different parties everywhere," said Nathan, 32. "On the weekends, it
will be a place for socialites and scene-sters, but on the other
nights, we are striving to become known as a music venue."</LD>
<TE>   On a recent Thursday, house, techno and trance fans traveled from
far away to groove to DJ Sandra Collins, who has been dubbed "the
trance goddess" and is one of the nation's finest DJs. Collins and
Bay Area DJ Aquanote performed as part of the weekly "Stereo" party
promoted by prominent DJ Gary Richards and DJ-producer Jason Bentley.
With electronica DJs around the world making tracks to play in Los
Angeles, Richards and Bentley hope that Ivar will become the venue of
choice for that music genre.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to brand this place as a music destination, fighting the
Hollywood association, the velvet rope, the actors and the wannabes,"
Bentley said. "We're still trying to find the best tone and signature
sound for this place."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, on this night the crowd was slow to warm up. Aquanote's
soulful house music did not motivate the 20-something clientele to
dance. But as soon as Collins, barefoot in a miniskirt, touched her
turntables, her up-tempo trance and tribal vibe seemed to move
everyone. Those who were not grooving around her were standing in
front of her, staring in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the most inspiring DJ," said Lorraine Contreras, 23, who
drove from Fresno with her best friend to listen to Collins. "She
connects one-on-one and makes you feel the show is just for you."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday and Saturday nights, Ivar turns into a hip-hop club
where celebrities such as Lara Flynn Boyle, Tobey Maguire and Marc
Anthony have been spotted mingling and partying, and co-owners Anton
Posniak, 30, Eric Weitzman, 32, and Rick Calamaro, 39, throw VIP
bashes on the third-floor mezzanine.</TE>
<TE>   With its capacity of 900, Ivar is second in overall size only to
the Highlands, which includes a split-level restaurant as well as a
dance club in the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the vibe; it's classy and you can breathe," said George
Libarian, 32, of Northridge, admiring the 14,600-square-foot space.
"It reminds me of the clubs in Finley Park in Boston."</TE>
<TE>   If the throngs at the club are any hint, people in other cities
may soon be saying the same about the Ivar.</TE>

<LD>The Patina Group, which runs the restaurant operations at the Music
Center and several other Los Angeles cultural institutions, will
operate the dining facilities at the new Disney Hall when it opens
next year.</LD>
<LD>   Those include a cafe and an upscale restaurant on the ground floor
of the Grand Avenue site, intended to appeal not only to concertgoers
but also to other downtown residents and visitors and to lunchtime
patrons from businesses in the area.</LD>
<LD>   But Patina's new deal with the Music Center is even broader than
that.</LD>
<TE>   Patina chef and founder Joachim Splichal will be involved in
developing a new restaurant at what is now Otto's and in remodeling
the fifth floor dining facilities at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to
allow for the flexibility of offering restaurant dining, cocktail
parties, receptions and opening-night parties.</TE>
<TE>   Patina, a subsidiary of Restaurant Associates, runs the food
services at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of
Contemporary Art and the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>

<DH>Always smart and emotive, Meshell Ndegeocello has created
her most eclectic CD yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lina Lecaro</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does it really mean anymore, for today's rap and R&amp;B artists, to
"keep it real"? There's nothing "real" about the designer duds,
Bentleys and $200 bottles of Cristal champagne depicted in video
after video from many of black music's biggest stars, unless we're
talking about a universal street-level fantasy of the good life.</LD>
<LD>   Though the recent neo-soul movement represented by the likes of
Alicia Keyes, Jill Scott and India.Arie has seen things shifting in a
more reflective direction, this, too, presents only a prescribed set
of feelings for the black community. If keeping it real means
stepping outside of these forms, there was a talent who boldly
expressed her real self -- wearing her heart on her sleeve -- long
before these newcomers.</LD>
<LD>   Meshell Ndegeocello has been writing and recording raw, extremely
personal, and decidedly outsider music with a funky, jazzy bounce for
nearly a decade. It's won her loads of critical acclaim and a legion
of loyal fans, but unlike Keyes, Scott or India.Arie, the D.C.-bred
singer-bassist (whose last name means "free like a bird" in Swahili)
has never tried to be a video diva -- or even a hit maker, for that
matter.</LD>
<TE>   With this summer's release, "Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape,"
the petite, boyishly exotic musician continues to buck pop-star
convention with her most eclectic -- and quite possibly most
provocative -- collection of songs. It's a tribute to her label,
Madonna's Maverick Recording Co., that Ndegeocello has never had to
abandon her highly spiritual, often political, sometimes overtly
sexual style.</TE>
<TE>   On her Grammy-nominated debut, 1993's "Plantation Lullabies,"
Ndegeocello scored a moderate hit with the infidelity anthem, "If
That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)," and raised even more
eyebrows with her tragic homophobia tale, off her 1996 follow-up,
"Peace Beyond Passion." Her third album, 1999's "Bitter," was mostly
filled with sensual love songs, with the question of monogamy once
again a prominent theme on cuts such as "Faithful" and "Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Though her sultrier vamps don't always address her partner's sex,
Ndegeocello has never been secretive about her personal life. She
lives with her girlfriend and Ndegeocello's preteen son (by a
previous relationship) in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "My responsibility is simply to be myself, to express myself as
sincerely as possible, and to be funky," says Ndegeocello, brushing
off the details that really differentiate her work from that of her
contemporaries. "I think that search for balance would be there
regardless of the gender of my partner. To think otherwise would be
to believe there is such thing as a 'gay song,' which is ridiculous.
Until a song a) has a gender, b) is capable of being in a
relationship or having sex, or c) can be beaten to death for who it
loves, let's not talk about songs being gay."</TE>
<TE>   While many of Ndegeocello's groove-filled jams provide the perfect
backdrop for between-the-sheets interludes, "Cookie's" societal
explorations end up being its most stimulating ones.</TE>
<TE>   The disc's buoyant opening cut features orations about human
rights and property rights, and considers the futility of renaming
streets after black political figures when nothing is done to improve
the neighborhoods those streets are in.</TE>
<TE>   "Hot Night" is built around snippets of an Angela Davis speech
about equality and embellished with verses by revered, socially
conscious rapper Talib Kweli. "God.Fear.Money" is the kind of
funk-inspired groover for which Ndegeocello is best known, this one
focusing on the trappings and temptations of today's "Total Request
Live"-driven music business. Ndegeocello has a message to spread, and
no one is immune to her scrutiny -- not even herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about critiquing the music industry, programmed radio, and
my own participation in that industry, " she explains. "I don't
believe in pointing fingers in one direction."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "Cookie's" examination of what Ndegeocello calls
"formulaic music production and radio formats" even contains an
ironic inside joke in the form of a raucous remix: "Pocketbook,"
produced by Missy Elliot and featuring rappers Redman and Tweet.</TE>
<TE>   "The remix is a formula -- get a platinum-selling producer and a
platinum-selling rapper, throw it together, and boom: radio play,
which is what is necessary in today's market to get my record heard,"
says Ndegeocello. "I put myself in the art piece in order to have the
right to critique the art piece."</TE>
<TE>   Though "Pocketbook" pumps up the rap attack to a new level,
Ndegeocello's music has always had a hip-hop flavor, whether she's
using her almost smooth-jazz vocal style or barking out brash rants.
But she considers herself a bassist first and foremost (she's played
with a variety of artists, from John Cougar Mellencamp to Alanis
Morissette), and her intricate, emotive instrumentation elevates her
hip-hop impulse to a unique, technical funk unlike any contemporary
performer, especially in a live setting.</TE>
<TE>   Playing with the same band for eight years now, Ndegeocello has an
obvious comfort zone on stage, which gives her the freedom to
experiment and take her older material in new directions. The group
never does the same set twice and often meanders through
improvisational hills and valleys, challenging one another through
jams that work very much like those of a jazz combo.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal every night is to sound better than the record and to
bring back the art of live music to the people," says Ndegeocello.
"The other day, somebody told me they made all three of their
children listen to my music -- that's better than any award I've ever
won. If the music inspires love and a human experience, then that's
what it's all about.</TE>
<TE>   "Its hard to not have the same financial success and therefore
artistic space that others have by virtue of how well they have
played the game, but I know that everything I do have, I've earned."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost every weekend on the dance circuit can feel a bit like
Halloween, with ravers in angel wings, masks and dressed as
characters from "Alice in Wonderland." Given that, dance music fans
treat Halloween not as just another day, but the day. Here are a few
places offering a pre-Halloween excuse to dress up and dance to
big-name talent.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Monster Massive, L.A. Sports Arena: In its fifth year, with more
than 40 acts, it's a great primer for new dance music fans. Last
year, the crowd was chill and the setup put the DJs at the center of
the Sports Arena. This year, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and AK1200
will work the Saturday all-ages show.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J. Cowan, Parks and Wilson; Red at Arena: Red's official Halloween
party, with Junior Sanchez, is next Friday, but this Friday's warmup
features progressive house heroes Parks and Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Naked L.A. Halloween, Grand Avenue: If, like Sammy Hagar, red is
your color, then come celebrate scarlet on Friday. Quality acts (Anne
Savage, Danny B., Steve Castro, Joseph Christopher, Sean Morales)
drive the party with hip-hop, hard-core and more.</TE>
<TE>   8</TE>
<TE>   Clinic Halloween, A.D.: Like Naked L.A. Halloween, Clinic
Halloween is an excuse to dress up on Saturday night. The music is
solid (Danny B., Jeff Bomb, Christos, Adam 12, T-Rex), and A.D. is
always packed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sander Kleinenberg &amp; Kazell, Spundae: Saturday night's top
alternative for those scared off by the all-ages Monster Massive
show, it features Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg, and a tribal theme
that encourages dressing up in paint and feathers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Digweed, Mayan: For those who care more about the music than
the party, on Wednesday this is the event. John Digweed is among the
world's elite DJs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twine Halloween, Knitting Factory: Special Wednesday Tribal Techno
Halloween Eve, featuring the Developer, Daniel and DJ Gonz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Halloween Masquerade Ball, Hollywood Athletic Club: Saturday's
sexy 6th annual fetish fest features the Damned plus club rooms by
Beat It, Synthetic, Sinamatic and Coven13.</TE>

<HD>Suit against Berry dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has thrown out a royalties lawsuit against Chuck
Berry by former collaborator Johnnie Johnson, ruling that too many
years had passed since the more than 30 songs in dispute were
written.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, a piano player, sued Berry in November 2000 in U.S.
District Court in St. Louis over royalties generated by songs written
from 1955-66. They include some of rock 'n' roll's most famous songs,
including "No Particular Place to Go," "Roll Over Beethoven" and
"Sweet Little Sixteen."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit argued that Johnson and Berry were co-writers on many
of the songs Berry made famous, but because Berry copyrighted them in
his name alone, Johnson got none of the royalties. Johnson's attorney
said they hadn't decided whether to appeal.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The makers of the CBS drama "CSI: Miami" are producing a show in
which crime fighters track down a sniper, but the network may
postpone the episode because of the real-life shooting attacks around
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The episode currently in production features a forensics team
studying crime scenes from an attacker who kills people from atop a
building.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of those bizarre cases where art collides with real
life," CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The story was conceived in August and a script was delivered last
month, weeks before the real attacks began around the nation's
capital. No decision has been made on when it will be broadcast,
Ender said.</TE>

<LD>The Chicago Symphony Orchestra closed out fiscal 2002 with operating
losses of $6.1 million on an operating budget of $59.6 million. Other
U.S. orchestras also have been reporting red ink, mostly attributable
to the nation's ongoing economic problems.</LD>
<LD>   Henry Fogel, president of the Chicago Symphony's governing body,
told trustees that despite record annual fund contributions of $14.8
million and a midseason rebound in single ticket sales, the orchestra
has suffered a widening gap between operating revenue and expenses.</LD>

<LD>Actor Nick Nolte was driving under the influence of the "date rape"
drug GHB when he was arrested last month, dazed and drooling, behind
the wheel of his automobile, prosecutors charged Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, Nolte, 61, is charged with driving under the influence and use
of a controlled substance, both misdemeanors, in connection with his
Sept. 11 arrest.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Oscar nominee, who checked himself into a substance
abuse clinic in Connecticut three days after his arrest, is to be
arraigned on the charges Monday, district attorney spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said.</LD>

<LD>The place</LD>
<LD>   Balboa, a grand old-fashioned city park in the tradition of
Central Park and Golden Gate, turns into San Diego's collective
backyard each weekend. Green lawns fill with sunbathers, hipsters,
gay couples, seniors, packs of high schoolers, and families with
babies in strollers. The people-watching is divine; there's always
someone getting married or some silly sideshow going on from Tarot
card readers to puppet shows. Take a peek inside any of a number of
museums or just wander around the magnificent Spanish colonial
buildings left over from the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, a
festival celebrating San Diego and the 1914 opening of the Panama
Canal.</LD>
<LD>   Where to find it</LD>
<TE>   Downtown, bounded on the east and west by 28 Street and 6th
Avenue, and on the north and south by Upas Street and Russ Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The main drag</TE>
<TE>   Enter on Laurel Street, which turns into El Prado.</TE>
<TE>   Where to hang out</TE>
<TE>   Just walking into the Museum of Art, with its large rotunda and
indoor fountain, is inspiring. The fun and funky "Axis Mexico: Common
Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions" show continues through March 9 with
paintings, videos and installations by contemporary Mexican artists.
For airheads, there's the Aerospace Museum with more than 65 air- and
spacecraft on display. Those who love plants can take a quiet stroll
in the Japanese Friendship Garden with its Zen spaces, Wisteria Arbor
and koi pond, or pop into the conservatory filled with exotic plants.
Stay for a show. "Imaginary Friends," a play by Nora Ephron with
music by Marvin Hamlisch, through Nov. 3 at the Old Globe Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo to Provence</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of concession stands selling everything from hot
dogs to ice cream bars. But for an inexpensive lunch, try the Tea
Pavilion for Japanese soups, noodles, rice bowls and scores of green,
white, black and herbal teas. The Prado offers Mexican food, seafood,
sandwiches, pasta and a full bar . For an elegant, upscale dinner,
Laurel Restaurant has an accent on flavors from southern France and
wines to match. And save room for Extraordinary Desserts: with treats
that are a feast for the eyes as well, like the tortes, decked out
with roses, ribbons and orchids. Organic coffees and Mariage Freres
teas accompany the sweets.</TE>
<TE>   Don't miss ...</TE>
<TE>   The Spreckels Organ Pavilion, where you can hear free concerts on
the king of instruments without going to church. No skating rink
ditties here but bona fide classical favorites by Bach, Buxtehude and
other longhaired composers.</TE>
<TE>   Skip-able</TE>
<TE>   The zoo. It'll still be there if you want to come back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I met a real dog in a bar. Two dogs, in fact. They were King Charles
Cavalier spaniels, the little silky dogs you see on laps in 18th
century British portraits. Posh dogs. Of course, I was in a posh
place: the St. Regis Monarch Beach's bar, on a sofa by the fireplace
on a Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   I have rarely met a dog I didn't like. I always resent it when
women say "men are dogs." If men were dogs, there would be a lot of
happy women in the world and no need for "The Rules" and that Mars
and Venus drivel.</LD>
<LD>   Attached to the dogs by two fine leather leashes was a
disproportionately large man who would have looked ridiculous had he
been formally painted with his pooches. He looked like an overgrown
Sammy Hagar: red-faced with a frizzy orangish-blond mane. He
interrupted my visit with the canines by asking me if I'd like a
drink. I was already having a drink, but my friend Sue chimed in
"yes!" and ordered a $12 glass of wine.</LD>
<TE>   As I finished my frothy drink, the guy told me I had a green aura,
which is "healing," and insisted on ordering me a V.O.P. cognac,
which stands for Very Old Pale. Kinda like him.</TE>
<TE>   Patting the spaniels, I figured I now owed some small talk, so I
asked him what he did. "I produce films," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just acquiring this company. It's in the Valley," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I put two and two together, moved away from him and whispered,
"Porn?"</TE>
<TE>   "We prefer the term 'adult,' " he said, and launched into a
lengthy defense of his industry. Now, I am a prude. I was a little
lightheaded from the V.O.P. cognac and the heat from the fire, and I
became concerned about why Mr. Porn Mogul supposed I was his type.
What had possessed me to put on fishnet stockings? They seemed
fashionable at the time....</TE>
<TE>   When Mr. PM suggested lunch at the Palm, I started to panic. Sue,
on her fourth glass of wine, was no help at all.</TE>
<TE>   There were some nice older women at the other end of the sofa, and
I desperately wanted to join in their discussion of green goddess
calla lilies. Then Mr. PM suggested he try his "chakra calibrator" on
me to see if my chakras were "spinning right." Egads. The
once-charming dogs suddenly seemed almost sordid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," I said. "I think I'm allergic to your dogs.
Ahhhh-choo! I have to go. Good night." I shook his hand, then ran
into the bathroom and scrubbed mine with antibacterial soap.</TE>

<HD>Slaying dragons, starting trends</HD>
<DH>A 1983 video game, the first one with cinematic qualities,
now has a sequel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dirk the Daring sure doesn't look like much of a revolutionary. He is
a flat-footed knucklehead in unshining armor, in way over his head on
a quest to rescue the girl from a fire-breathing dragon. But two
decades ago, Dirk was a pioneer in the convergence of video games and
movies that is now a major trend in on-screen entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk was the hero of Dragon's Lair, a 1983 arcade game with rare
cinematic qualities, marrying classic hand-painted animation with
laser-disc technology. As it turns out, its film-like interface with
the player was a sneak peak at the future.</LD>
<LD>   "The game people know very well they're in competition with the
movie people," says veteran animator Don Bluth, whose studio brought
Dirk to life in that first game.</LD>
<TE>   He has now returned for the new Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the
Lair, debuting on Xbox in November. "It will be a competition to see
who will put the best visuals on the screen." Today, it's not unusual
for major game makers to recruit actors, writers and technical
experts from Hollywood. But in the early '80s, Dragon's Lair broke
through game barriers of storytelling and budget, spending $100,000
for each of the game's 20 minutes of animation.</TE>
<TE>   The game was a major departure from the likes of Ms. Pac-Man and
Defender in that the graphics were not computer-generated. Instead,
players were shown a few seconds of traditional film animation that
led up to a challenge requiring a particular move with the joystick,
before continuing on to the next part of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Dragon's Lair was a major hit, and is one of only three video
games in the Smithsonian Institution. The continuing merger of games
and cinema, however, made the classic prime for a remake.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't that smart back then," jokes Rick Dyer, a young game
designer and animation fanatic when he first approached Bluth in
1982. "We just had a vision ... somehow we figured out a way to make
it."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Bluth was approached again by Dyer, now CEO of
Dragonstone Software in Diamond Bar, who told him that technology now
existed to re-create the look of the original game and make it a
fully interactive, 3-D experience. "I got really excited at that
point," Bluth says.</TE>
<TE>   Dragon's Lair 3D is the first true sequel to the game, re-creating
the fluid look of classic animation as a 3-D game. It is also
designed for high-definition TV, and variations of Dragon's Lair will
be available for PC and the new generation of consoles (PlayStation
2, Xbox and GameCube) from publishers Ubi Soft and Encore.</TE>
<TE>   To create the new game, Bluth and Dragonstone drew on many of the
original's vintage backgrounds and cels as a guide. Bluth's studio in
Phoenix also created new opening and closing animated sequences,
which blend almost seamlessly with the computerized game play.</TE>
<TE>   "We walked into it not as gamers, but as filmmakers," says Bluth,
whose career includes several Disney classics, along with such films
as 1982's "Secret of NIMH" and 2000's "Titan A.E."</TE>
<TE>   Now, after nearly five decades as an animator, he's found that
many consider Dirk the Daring his most memorable creation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, "we went in there thinking this was a pit stop while we
were waiting to make the next film," says Bluth, who now has a
Dragon's Lair animated feature in pre-production. "But it turns out
that this is the thing we'll be most remembered for.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that weird? But I'm OK with that."</TE>

<HD>'A Field of Daisies' freshly blooming</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>In a moment of creative despair, director-writer Matt Chaffee
realized that "Untitled Virgin-Whore Project" was a terrible name for
a nutty new comedy play about modern-day dating. "I have to give them
something stupid," he told himself, "like ... 'Fluffy Bunnies in a
Field of Daisies'!"</LD>
<LD>   Within moments of this oddball inspiration, Chaffee was on the
phone to his producer, collaborator and best friend, Samuel Bliss
Cooper, who is also double-cast as the hapless romantic Baby Boy. "I
called him up and said: 'We're changing the title.' There was a
deafening silence on the other end of the phone. Then I said: 'And
we're putting in a dance number!' "</LD>
<LD>   Would a daisy by any other name be as fluffy? The positive reviews
that followed seemed to vindicate the change. Now, bowing to popular
demand, "Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies," expected to run about
four weeks when it opened June 7 at Hollywood's 47-seat Zoo Theatre
on a funky strip of Cahuenga Boulevard, has been extended again, this
time through Nov. 24.</LD>
<TE>   This means the volunteer cast and crew will work for no salary for
almost five months longer than they ever dreamed. But everyone
involved in this labor of fluff is thrilled by the unexpected
success.</TE>
<TE>   Chaffee and Cooper, both 30 and single, are friends who hate
"Friends." "Our play is humor in similar circumstances, but I don't
think they go deep enough," Chaffee says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like hyper-'Friends,' " offers Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Both believe that men drowning in the dating pool are obsessed
with the did-she-or-didn't-she question.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strictly a male phenomenon, and it's not something that will
ever be solved or ever change. Women can be who they are and watch
the men flounder around them," observes Chafee. "The men are clearly
the people who don't have it together."</TE>

<LD>At first glance, Insomnia is just another raggedy-casual coffee shop
in the Fairfax-Melrose neighborhood, a place where regulars put in
half-day shifts writing screenplays on battered velour couches. But
only insiders know that the 13-year-old establishment also is a
leader in what the art world calls "latrinalia -- yes, toilet art.</LD>
<LD>   Framed by a thrift-store armchair and a faux Venetian mirror, the
mix of commissioned and ad-lib art in the unisex loo is worth seeing.
A starry-night mural on the ceiling melts down the walls. A bearded,
mustachioed reproduction of Mona Lisa stuck high up in a corner casts
a suspicious glance. Hundreds of graffiti souvenirs -- witty,
political, silly -- leap from the walls.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with the bathroom doodling in clubs and bars,
caffeine-fueled graffiti is contemplative rather than salacious,
ironic rather than pugnacious. "WW III? Blame yourself! I voted for
Gore," barks an entry. One note cheekily suggests, "For a good time,
call 1-800-ANARCHY." (I did, and reached an art gallery.)</LD>
<TE>   Latrinalia flourishes wherever the public, well, goes. It remains
decidedly lowbrow, largely anonymous and seldom lasts longer than the
few weeks between paint jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet its power to fascinate cannot be denied. At Insomnia and Cafe
Luna Sol, a co-op restaurant-cum-performance space, customers have
been known to park themselves in the restroom for hours. "You get a
feel for what kind of place it is from the art in the bathroom," says
Obi-I, a founding member of Cafe Luna Sol.</TE>
<TE>   While chains such as Starbucks and Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf
generally keep their bathrooms squeaky clean, offbeat establishments
are more likely to accommodate artistic customers.</TE>
<TE>   When Insomnia owner Lucia Yi commissioned the bathroom mural two
years ago, she figured it would discourage customers from doodling on
the walls. Instead, she found, art begot more art. There are serious
musings: "The movie industry couldn't be more racist if it was their
mission statement to promote separatism whenever and wherever
possible." There are political proclamations from the right ("Big
Business rules, the environment sucks!"), the left ("Osama bin Laden
is a conservative"), and the left field ("Morse code forever!").
There are sincere admissions ("I enjoy pornography") and the
occasional tongue-in-cheek personal plug ("Johnnypupa.com: your new
Jesus").</TE>
<TE>   There are drawings, too, including a subversive Powerfpuff girl
sporting an A for "anarchist" on her pinafore. And they may all
disappear overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Every few months, Cafe Luna Sol obliterates its toilet gallery
with a fresh coat of paint. "We try to maintain some structure
without making it too structured," says Obi-I. There are, however, a
few unwritten rules. Spray painting is not cool, nor is scribbling
over other people's work. Tortured poetry and gang-style writing are
not tolerated. Otherwise the field is wide open to all prophets and
poets. The current exhibit at Cafe Luna Sol -- including a Keith
Haring-esque cat in silver paint -- is 2 months old and growing.
Access to it, and any other coffee shop latrinalia, is free of
charge, but you would be wise to invest in several cups of coffee. It
will provide you with a legitimate excuse to visit the bathroom.</TE>

<TE>   Alfonso Cuaron's sexually audacious Mexican comedy-drama about two
randy teenage boys who learn about sex and love from an older woman
was a big art house hit earlier this year. And for good reason --
it's dizzyingly good, with near-perfect performances from its three
leads.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition, available in both the unrated theatrical and
R-rated versions, has very readable subtitles and some appealing
extras. But the commentary track with Luna and Bernal is a real bust
for those viewers who don't know Spanish because it's only available
in that language.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Deeds</TE>
<TE>   Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar. $23 for VHS; $28 for DVD</TE>
<TE>   Listen! What's that noise? It's director Frank Capra, writer
Robert Riskin and actors Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur turning over in
their graves about "Mr. Deeds," the witless Adam Sandler-Winona Ryder
remake of their classic 1936 comedy, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."</TE>
<TE>   Capra won his second best director Oscar for the social comedy
about a small-town poet who inherits a fortune from a distant
relative living in New York. Sandler is no match for Coop's charm and
likability, and Ryder pales in comparison to Arthur as a savvy
reporter who falls for Deeds.</TE>
<TE>   For fans of the original, the commentary from director Steve Brill
and writer Tim Herlihy, who did the Sandler bomb "Little Nicky," will
make them scream. Not only do they refer to the original as "Mr.
Deeds Comes to Town," they admit they don't like old movies and never
even watched the original all the way through because they didn't
want to deal with the plot point in which Deeds tries to give away
his money to the poor and homeless during the Depression. Perhaps if
Brill and Herlihy studied the classics, they wouldn't make movies
like "Little Nicky" and "Mr. Deeds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wild Style</TE>
<TE>   "Lee" Georges Quinones, Fab Five Freddy</TE>
<TE>   Rhino, $20</TE>
<TE>   Filmed entirely in New York's South Bronx on a shoestring budget
in 1982, "Wild Style" works much better as a time capsule than a
drama. Graffiti artist Quinones plays an outlaw artist named Zorro
who paints an arena for a big outdoor hip-hop concert.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a new digital transfer from the original
16-millimeter film, a photo gallery, the trailer and decent
commentary from writer-director Charlie Ahearn and Fab Five Freddy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tabu</TE>
<TE>   Reri, Matahi</TE>
<TE>   Image/Milestone, $30</TE>
<TE>   "Tabu" is the last film of the acclaimed German director F.W.
Murnau ("Sunrise," "Nosferatu"). Released just weeks after Murnau's
death in a car accident in 1931, "Tabu" was the only collaboration
between Murnau and documentarian Robert Flaherty ("Nanook of the
North").</TE>
<TE>   The drama, filmed in Tahiti, revolves around two lovers (Reri,
Matahi) who find their relationship doomed when a tribal edict
declares she's "tabu" to men. It's been beautifully restored by the
UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a low-key but informative commentary by UCLA film
professor Janet Bergstrom, who talks about numerous production
problems and the stormy relationship between Murnau and Flaherty.</TE>

<HD>Le Nouvel adds tango, folk to chamber mix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Montreal's fine contemporary chamber group Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne
avoided the familiar model of a new music concert at the opening of
this season's Monday Evening Concerts series at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. Instead of a concert stocked with newly minted
or well-established pieces, the ensemble culled intriguing scores
from the '80s forward.</LD>
<LD>   When performed with the energy and clarity of director Lorraine
Vaillancourt's group, this approach nurtures the notion that
contemporary music as a whole has genuine shelf life.</LD>
<LD>   A theme of sorts emerged: music about music, and the ways that
external influences and musical structures and effects can be
creatively rerouted. There wasn't a "straight" piece in the lot.</LD>
<TE>   Framing the program were Inouk Demers' "Lo que vendra" and
composer Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez's rugged "Son del Corazon," the
former colored by tango, the latter by Huesteco folk music from
central Mexico. Tango is all but subsumed into Demers' essentially
abstract language, with only teasing hints of tango passion slipping
through.</TE>
<TE>   Folkloric Mexican elements have more sway in Sanchez-Gutierrez's
piece, with a bounding vigor and muscular effects sometimes,
logically, borrowed from "The Rite of Spring."</TE>
<TE>   Musical form was the putty in Pascal Dusapin's "Coda," marked by a
dramatic struggle within the notes as they vied to cohere and to
break loose. Composer Franco Donatoni's "Arpege" was a highlight.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the concert conveyed ideas that are cerebral at the core,
but underlined with a visceral one-two punch.</TE>

<HD>Bohemian rhapsody</HD>
<DH>In eclectic Echo Park, a growing community of musicians is
churning out diverse sounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four or five nights a week and a few times during the day, the men of
Wiskey Biscuit plunge into the clutter of instruments, wires, heaping
ashtrays and empty beer bottles inside a former beauty parlor on Echo
Park Avenue. There's a battered upright piano against one wall that
they found abandoned on the street and pushed six blocks to the
studio -- the unofficial Echo Park recycling system.</LD>
<LD>   The five (sometimes more) smoke cigarettes and down a beer or two,
shooting the breeze as they plug in to rehearse or record or, on a
show night, slowly load their gear into their cars. Then the caravan
heads off to play another gig--rock 'n' roll if they're Wiskey
Biscuit tonight, or dub reggae if they're Future Pigeon.</LD>
<LD>   At his house just a couple of roller-coaster hills west of the
salon, Justin Burrill puts his guitar into his white minivan and
rolls down the narrow street to a rehearsal with W.A.C.O.</LD>
<TE>   Around the first curve, he passes the street where Mark Wheaton
and Weba Garretson live. Chances are that the recording studio in
their basement will be humming, with either a nocturnal client or one
of their own projects.</TE>
<TE>   You can complete the loop by going back along Echo Park Avenue to
Farmer Dave's apartment, directly across the street from the
converted beauty salon. Dave Scher's band, Beachwood Sparks, has just
finished a long tour of the U.S. and Europe, and he's determined to
hole up here and write some music, do some drawing. But before long
he's so busy playing with neighbors' bands that he has to bow out of
a Future Pigeon show. That's the way it's getting to be in Echo Park.
You can hardly pick up a puerquito at a Sunset Boulevard panaderia or
climb one of the hillside stairways without running into another
musician. These days you could form a band, practice, make a record
and play some shows without leaving the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   You can still find dirt lanes and hear roosters crow in this
district between downtown L.A. and Silver Lake, where the small
canyons north of Sunset form a knobby terrain of angled ridges and
steep hills crowned with palms and eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   Cut off from the surrounding areas by the Hollywood Freeway on the
south, the torrential traffic of Glendale Boulevard on the west,
Elysian Park on the east and the Los Angeles River on the north, Echo
Park maintains a sense of psychic separation that has always
attracted artists and social mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   For the past couple of years, its musical life has been building
toward critical mass, and the area is now generating some of the
smartest, most diverse and unpredictable music in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   How unpredictable? In Dengue Fever, the bassist from the folk-rock
Radar Brothers and three other musicians play funky, international
grooves behind Chhom Nimol, who sings and dresses in the glamorous
pop fashion of her native Cambodia. There's a whole cadre of
challenging art bands, including Listing Ship, whose singer, Heather
Lockie, also plays viola in W.A.C.O. and lives in the same building
with members of the winsome pop bands Irving and Let's Go Sailing.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho Falls and I See Hawks in L.A. play country rock, Dntel emits
a sublime electronic pop and veterans the Warlocks and Brian
Jonestown Massacre churn out classic garage-punk. Dreamy pop group
Rilo Kiley just released a new album, and rock en espanol guru
Gustavo Santaolalla makes his influential records at an Echo Park
studio. Two great '90s albums, the Eels' "Beautiful Freak" and
"Electro Shock Blues," were recorded mainly in the laundry-room
studio of leader E's house at the foot of one of the city's steepest
hills.</TE>
<TE>   Artistic, affordable</TE>
<TE>   People might talk about the cultural diversity and the views, but
the real prerequisite for an artists' enclave is cheap rent. That's
been a given in Echo Park, but the rates are starting to rise now.
Everyone has a story of a friend being priced out of the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's an inevitable result of discovery and demand. Echo Park
has long been a low-key outpost, conducting its creative commerce
quietly and privately. But now public spaces have sprouted, from the
Chicken Corner shops on Echo Park Avenue to Sea Level Records on
Sunset, from the Short Stop bar on the east to the Downbeat cafe on
the west.</TE>
<TE>   "The character is a very precious balance at the moment," Scher
says. "The mix of cultures is not like something you'll find in any
other part of L.A. It's something that's that is easily damaged."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Dave Scher is intimately acquainted with the
transformation. His girlfriend, Kimme Buzzelli, owns Show Pony, a hot
boutique in one of the storefronts at nearby Chicken Corner.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection is named for the poultry-themed mural on the
north side of the building. The strip of businesses includes a
mom-and-pop market alongside the new art galleries and shops. Show
Pony occupies a space that formerly housed the Suku Suku Club, a bar
that was closed down after a 1993 slaying. Instead of gun-toting
hotheads, the sidewalk now swarms with L.A.'s art world cognoscenti
when the galleries stage their opening nights on the first Saturday
of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Scher's cluttered, unkempt one-bedroom apartment, on the second
floor of a building owned by ceramic artist and Echo Park arts
patriarch Peter Shire, is not exactly a rustic retreat. Scher does
what he can, placing a board along the bottom of his living-room
window to eliminate the parked cars from his view of sky and
treetops. "For all you could tell, we're in the woods right now. You
can maintain such illusions here quite easily," he says, speaking
with an oddly delicate, lilting twang.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up mainly in Long Beach, then lived in Westchester when he
was program director at Loyola Marymount University's FM radio
station, KXLU (88.9). He discovered Echo Park through Wiskey Biscuit,
whose members were regular callers to his show and invited him to a
party at their house.</TE>
<TE>   Beachwood Sparks is signed to Seattle indie label Sub Pop, and its
psychedelic spin on country rock has drawn the foundation of a
following and great reviews.</TE>
<TE>   But when the group's not touring, cash flow can get "a little
patchy." Thus, Farmer Dave's Hot Nuts: Scher cooks up his aunt's
recipe for spiced almonds, packs them in bags at $2 increments, slaps
on a hand-drawn label and peddles them where he can. Scher also gives
music lessons, paints furniture with a friend, installs drip systems
in gardens and draws designs for his girlfriend's store.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seems to be able to balance drudgery with having a
quality existence," Scher says. That means hikes in Elysian Park and
coffee with friends at their homes or at the Downbeat. Best of all,
he'll set up his pedal steel guitar in his living room and record
some music that he couldn't make anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to describe exactly how this neighborhood influences
the sound, other than that you receive the impressions and it comes
out of you. That's why artists try to live somewhere interesting
usually."</TE>
<TE>   Making ends meet</TE>
<TE>   You'll sometimes find Farmer Dave's Hot Nuts at Cooke's Family
Market, north of Malibu. Scher's friend Danny Preston is the manager
of the store and also plays keyboards for Wiskey Biscuit, a band
whose ramshackle music and unflagging energy have made it an anchor
of the Echo Park community.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be misled by the slacker vibe they spin when they sing "I
like sleeping all day long...."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," says singer Jason Mason, "just give me a chance to slack
and I will. I just don't have a chance right now. I can't ditch the
Dub Club, I can't ditch Future Pigeon. I can't ditch Wiskey Biscuit."</TE>
<TE>   Mason, 30, a slight figure emanating rock-star cool, is sitting
with the Opie-esque Preston, also 30, in the living room of a funky
Craftsman in the throes of a remodeling. Mason lays three cigarettes
on the heavy wooden table and lights a fourth, while Preston rolls
his own. Their street tilts toward the downtown skyline and the rear
windows and downstairs deck afford a million-dollar view of L.A.'s
western plain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better to be on a hill," observes Mason, who spent his
preteen years in San Antonio. "It's the only place in L.A. you can
get a breeze. Unless you're on the beach, and who can afford to go
over there?"</TE>
<TE>   Preston bought the house at auction six years ago, after two years
of communal band life in a Hancock Park mansion courtesy of a
two-album deal with Geffen Records. (Results: one album recorded,
none released.)</TE>
<TE>   Then Mason got $10,000 for helping his father with an advertising
project, Preston refinanced and they made "Santa Ana River Delta
Blues" (the band members met in Orange County high schools), which
they released in 2000 on their Shipwrecords label. Preston refinanced
again, and they recorded a second album, "Zig Zag."</TE>
<TE>   Rootsy in a folk-country-blues-Cajun way, with the bite of a
post-punk "Exile on Main Street" and the loose camaraderie the old
Faces, Wiskey Biscuit's music has a sloppy charm and easy appeal. But
though they play regularly, they're not a big draw, and they haven't
made any money from their records.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with this absence of career momentum, they've become even
busier and more diversified. Donning masks, helmets and, in Mason's
case, a blinding red suit, they periodically mutate into a group
called Future Pigeon, playing deeply grooved, heavily echoed dub
reggae. Their record producer Eddie Ruscha, Scher and assorted
sidemen usually join the party.</TE>
<TE>   Future Pigeon has released one album, "Golden State of Dub," and
on Wednesday nights Mason and Ruscha spin reggae records at the Short
Stop, a former hard-core cop bar that recently changed identities and
became a hipster's destination. They call it the Dub Club, and they
get paid 10% of the bar, which has become considerable since the
place caught on.</TE>
<TE>   It all helps. Mason, who pays rent to Preston for his room at the
house, also DJs Fridays at the Short Stop, and three days a week he
and Ruscha work as assistants for Eddie's father, famed artist Ed
Ruscha. Preston, meantime, runs the market in Malibu (it's his
family's business) five days or more a week. He and Ruscha share the
rent on the beauty parlor rehearsal room.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it can look precarious, but Mason has no concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Wiskey Biscuit is gonna be playing forever, so I'm not
worried about that. We've been so consumed for so long that it has
taken this mellow feel. 'Cause it's so much a part of us now....
There is no goal because it's part of us."</TE>
<TE>   Studio with a view</TE>
<TE>   For Justin Burrill, who grew up in the Connecticut countryside,
Echo Park's hills and trees were definitely a major attraction when
he bought the house in 1999. In fact, when he had a recording studio
built just off his living room, he had the designer install French
doors and a window in the control room.</TE>
<TE>   Burrill, who lives here with his wife, Suzel, and their two
children, ages 8 and 16, says the rear section of the house was moved
here from Compton in 1950. The high-ceilinged living room was a later
addition.</TE>
<TE>   Suzel works full time for Vivendi Universal as a marketing
assistant in international TV distribution. Burrill's primary
occupation is hiring out the studio and his services for everything
from rock-band recording sessions to voice-over work to mixing,
mastering and film post-production. He's also the producer of
W.A.C.O.'s records.</TE>
<TE>   The group evolved from Wild Stares, a band Burrill, 44, and high
school friend Steve Gregoropoulos formed in New England in 1979.
Their long odyssey took them to Europe and eventually Los Angeles,
where an acoustic night at Al's Bar in 1993 triggered their
transformation into the Wild Chamber Acoustic Orchestra, now 13
members strong, idiosyncratically original and defiantly impractical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's far from self-supporting," says Burrill, sitting in front of
the soundboard in his incongruously sun-drenched control room. "We've
gone on the road a couple of times, but to do any extensive touring
is just impossible.... But we've been doing this a long time, and
we've always managed to make recordings. Where there's a will there's
a way."</TE>
<TE>   Gregoropoulos' house is just across the Silver Lake border, and
the long living room this rehearsal night is packed elbow-to-kneecap
with cellists, violinists and reed and horn players. At regular
intervals, the front door opens with a thump against seated bassist
Pablo Garcia and another musician squeezes in, scanning the room for
a vacant space and empty music stand.</TE>
<TE>   Burrill sits on a high stool by the kitchen door with his old
Gibson guitar, stitching intricate chord patterns into the tapestry
of horns and strings. Gregoropoulos, who looks like Crispin Glover
portraying a mad composer, is W.A.C.O.'s singer, songwriter and
arranger, and he leads his group with a firm but friendly hand.
They'll be recording these songs for an album soon and the players
bear down for most of the two hours, crafting a rich, sophisticated
orchestral pop.</TE>
<TE>   W.A.C.O.'s records come out on True Classical, a co-op label
founded by Gregoropoulos and Lockie. Among the artists it releases
are singer-songwriter Michael Whitmore and such experimentalists as
Ape Has Killed Ape, Listing Ship and Ultra-Red.</TE>
<TE>   It will also put out the debut album by Weba Garretson's group,
the Eastside Sinfonietta, featuring a set of Weill, Brecht and Eisler
songs, due in January. Like Burrill, the singer and her husband, Mark
Wheaton, are in the business of renting studio services, and their
basement operation, Catasonic, has mixed, mastered, edited and
recorded everyone from jazz artist and former Mothers of Invention
member Don Preston (a neighbor) to L.A. avant-garde leaders Nels
Cline and Carla Bozulich.</TE>
<TE>   In this family of two, there are no day jobs to fall back on.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's kind of fun about it," says Wheaton, 53. "You wake
up one morning and you don't have any work and you think, 'Well, I
guess I'm gonna have to go out and look for a job,' and all of a
sudden the phone rings and you're back into it."</TE>
<TE>   Wheaton and Garretson, who married in 1986, have been fixtures on
the city's avant-rock and performance-art scene since arriving here
from Seattle and New York, respectively, at the dawn of the '80s.
They moved to this house in 1992, first renting and then buying it in
1996. That makes them pioneers of sorts in Echo Park's new musical
age.</TE>
<TE>   They've turned their frontyard into a thriving garden and they're
re-landscaping their sprawling backyard, whose most prominent feature
is a low enclosure for three desert tortoises.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like the fact that we can work in the garden and
decompress from the things you get wound up in when you're creating,"
Garretson, 44, says. "The only way we ever really stop working in the
studio is go outside and don't bring the phone, or leave."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation</TE>
<TE>   The changes have come quickly to Echo Park: live rock and other
music in the bar at the 75-year-old French restaurant Les Freres
Taix; DJs and electronic acts at the Echo, opened by the Spaceland
people last year in an old Spanish restaurant; in-store performances
at the indie-centric Sea Level record shop; Chicken Corner and the
Short Stop as trendy spots; the Downbeat as a neighborhood hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of when the East Village [in New York] exploded
again in the late '80s," says former Afghan Whigs singer Greg Dulli,
one of the six partners who bought and transfigured the Short Stop
last year. "A lot of people who were pushed out of neighborhoods that
had become super-gentrified needed a place to go."</TE>
<TE>   Will the same happen here? Locals keep a wary eye out for leakage
from the mercantile boom a couple of miles west in Silver Lake. "I
don't think it would take much to tip this neighborhood," Farmer Dave
Scher says, sounding more fatalistic than fearful. "But at the moment
it's a really brilliant place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood sound</TE>
<TE>   If you want to compile a mix CD for a hike through these hills,
you can find a good sampling of Echo Park music from this assortment
of CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Eels, "Beautiful Freak" (DreamWorks, 1996). Contains the mother of
all Echo Park songs, "Susan's House."</TE>
<TE>   I See Hawks in L.A., "I See Hawks in L.A." (Ethic, 2001). In the
title song he wrote, guitarist Paul Lacques turns one of the
neighborhood's regular aerial features into a potent image of
loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   W.A.C.O., "Game of Cards" (True Classical, 2001), Listing Ship,
"Dance Class Revolution" (True Classical, 2002). These intertwined
outfits are the leading exemplars of Echo Park's art/experimental
community.</TE>
<TE>   Beachwood Sparks, "Make the Cowboy Robots Cry" (Sub Pop, 2002).
The six-song EP takes the band's cosmic country into an almost
pointillistic realm, with electronics help from neighbor Jimmy
Tamborello, who records under the name Dntel.</TE>
<TE>   Wiskey Biscuit, "Santa Ana River Delta Blues" (Shipwrecords,
2000), and "Zig Zag" (Shipwrecords, 2001). If any band defines Echo
Park's distinctive mix of urban grit and country greenery, this is
the one.</TE>
<TE>   Future Pigeon, "Golden State of Dub" (Shipwrecords, 2001). Wiskey
Biscuit's other incarnation reflects the neighborhood's substantial
reggae vibe.</TE>

<KH>My Favorite Weekend: DJ Irene</KH>
<HD>It all begins with a workout</HD>

<AU>Carolyn Patricia Scott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This DJ's latest album, "Phonosynthesis," has been on Billboard's
Electronic Album chart for months. ClubNation 2002's just named her
National DJ of the Year. And Saturday she headlines the Monster
Massive Halloween 2002 extravaganza at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Body and soul</LD>
<LD>   My weekends start on Sunday or Monday. I like to wake up late. And
I work out every day that I'm not traveling. I meet my personal
trainer at Bally's in Hollywood. After I work out, I go to the Paint
Shop off Robertson for a manicure and pedicure. They put lemons and
spices in the water. I mean, you can have a margarita pedicure! Then
I have my eyebrows done at Valerie's in Beverly Hills--got to get
that arch!</LD>
<TE>   Getting my grub</TE>
<TE>   After that, I like to go eat. My favorite places and meals are:
Mondrian's on Sunset -- Tuna Picas are like marinated tuna on a
wonton chip with hot chili sauce; Murakakami's on Santa Monica --
It's the best sushi in L.A.! Metropol on 3rd downtown -- they make
these sandwiches and it takes time to bake the bread. Sometimes I ask
them, "Hey, where's my sandwich?" But they're good.</TE>
<TE>   Shopoholic vibe</TE>
<TE>   Then I go shopping at the Beverly Center or at Gucci, or at Hugo
Boss--I'm a big fan. And I like Prada Sports at Barney's, if I can
find my size. I like Monge downtown L.A. for my custom stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, baby!</TE>
<TE>   I love watching movies at the Chinese 6 in Hollywood. They have a
VIP section with really big chairs and they bring the popcorn and
soda right to you. I can sit there and watch a movie over and over
again.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a big James Bond fan. I'm a huge fan of Sean Connery. I have
most of the Bond movies and all of the soundtracks on DVD and CD. Oh
yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing "Goldmember." The movie's
club scene was filmed at the Arena where I worked for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   Afternoons I might go to the Rooftop at the Standard Hotel on 6th.
They've got couches like waterbeds -- maybe five people can climb
into them and get their drink on -- it's so Austin Powers. The last
time I was there, everybody was dancing -- Ben Stiller was there.</TE>
<TE>   Back to the crib</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, I just want to be home watching a DVD and taking a
break from all of the touring -- I've been to Amsterdam, Costa Rica
and all over the United States.</TE>

<LD>   Nickel and Dimed -- The Mark Taper Forum has done a daring thing:
putting on a play that attacks the economic privilege of 90% of the
people who will see it. Joan Holden's adaptation of social critic
Barbara Ehrenreich's book "Nickel and Dimed," about the working poor,
is a heady evening, steering us at Wal-Mart-aisle level through the
physical hardship, corporate peonage and other indignities of life at
minimum wage. Ehrenreich's irrepressible sense of humor, admirably
translated by Holden, softens the agitprop by taking nonpolitical
pleasure in a wide range of human behavior on view.</LD>
<LD>   -- Sean Mitchell</LD>
<TE>   Ends Saturday at Mark Taper Forum, 135 N. Grand Ave., L.A. (213)
628-2772.</TE>

<LD>Scott Timberg in his critique of L.A. Opera ("Out of earshot," Oct.
17) claims that the opera company has lost the under-30 crowd because
its "programming has budged little since Placido Domingo took over."</LD>
<LD>   When has any opera company, anywhere, actually "had" the under-30
crowd?</LD>
<LD>   He claims that virtually no 20th century works "have found their
way onto our stage." Last season, Mr. Domingo's first as artistic
director, the opera presented nine productions. Four of those,
"Turandot," "Moses und Aron," "Duke Bluebeard's Castle," and "Giani
Schicchi" (the last two directed by me) were written in the 20th
century. All were extremely well received and well attended.</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Timberg claims that prices have gone up in the last two years.
In fact, ticket prices have risen 3% in that period, a normal
increase for any major downtown event. Try getting a good, cheap seat
to a Clippers game for less than $50. Floor seats are now $175 per
game.</TE>
<TE>   He says that unlike "the more cerebral and abstract medium of
classical music," opera should connect more with young people. What
is the meaning, truth or relevance of that? He goes on to explain
that opera contains all the staples of a "blood-and-guts spectacle,"
"sex, violence, loud singing."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he thinks the under-30 crowd would show up if they could
actually see more blood and guts and full-frontal nudity or simulated
copulation. I can see them bypassing "Red Dragon" for an opera
presented in this way.</TE>

<TE>   It is no wonder opera in Los Angeles has lost the youth in its
audience. When one goes to the Los Angeles Opera it is like sitting
in an AARP meeting. One can come up with all kinds of theories, but
really the answer is very simple: The cost of tickets is much, much
too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   When the cheap seats in the third-balcony nosebleed section are
$35, and the good front-orchestra section seats are $167, who can
afford to attend? Only the affluent retired.</TE>

<LD>I love Liz Smith's column and I read it religiously. She gets
everything right 98% of the time. But she is wrong when she says that
Antonio Banderas will make his stage debut when he appears in a
revival of "Nine" on Broadway ("Rivera will turn heat up to 'Nine,' "
Oct. 17).</LD>
<LD>   I have seen Banderas perform in starring roles in many major
theatrical productions in Madrid, both before and after he became a
star in the films of director Pedro Almodovar. What Smith should have
said is that Banderas will be making his American stage debut when he
appears in "Nine."</LD>

<LD>Some people should never be allowed to carry cell phones. It's bad
enough when a pleasant moment is shattered by a musical ring that's
too loud, too shrill, but when that man answers, shouting at the top
of his lungs into a cell phone the size of a boom box, it's too much.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to "Trigger Happy TV," a British import shown on Comedy
Central on Thursdays at 10:30 p.m., a playground, of sorts, for
British comedian Dom Joly, a self-described "manic depressant." Each
half-hour episode, consisting of short vignettes shot largely with
hidden cameras in and around London, was written and directed by
Joly. And he's seen in a giant red dog costume, pummeling a giant
Dalmatian.</LD>
<LD>   "Trigger Happy TV" can be crude at times, as when giant rabbits
simulate sex in a park, and some of the bits just don't hold up well
to frequent repetition. Segments can also be whimsical -- a gang of
giant cats overturning trash cans in the middle of the night -- and
they can be downright cruel, as when Joly plays a stoic Royal
Guardsman flipping out at a tourist for taking his picture.</LD>
<TE>   "Trigger Happy TV's" real strength comes from the reactions of the
victims of Joly's clever setups. It says something about modern
culture that people walk past a violent confrontation between giant
dogs. It's left to the viewer to wonder just what that says.</TE>
<TE>   We're also left to wonder why they let Joly into concerts and
movies with that big cell phone in the first place.</TE>

<HD>71 films to screen at festival</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its third annual event taking place between tonight and Sunday,
the Ojai Film Festival continues its slow, steady growth. Spawned as
an extension of the long-standing Ojai Film Society, the festival
officially breaks off on its own this year as an independent
nonprofit organization.</LD>
<LD>   In this year's model, a list of 71 films -- shorts, features and
documentaries -- will be screened at the Ojai Playhouse Theater and
the auditoriums of Chaparral High School and Matilija Junior High.
Seminars at the Ojai Art Center include "Reel People -- Creating
Believable Characters" and sessions on writing for feature animation,
computer effects and the nitty-gritty of producing.</LD>
<LD>   It opens with a public flourish at 7 p.m. today with a free
outdoor screening of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" at Libbey
Bowl. The occasion is a tribute to cinematographer Conrad Hall, whose
long filmography includes his Oscar-winning work on "Butch Cassidy"
and the 2000 film "American Beauty."</LD>
<TE>   Hall, slated to be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award, will
be recognized after the screening and at the gala awards brunch at 11
a.m. Sunday at the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa.</TE>
<TE>   "The Music Man" (tickets $7) will be screened Saturday at Libbey
Bowl after a 5 p.m. reception (tickets $25) at the Ojai Art Center
honoring actress Shirley Jones. The Nordhoff High School marching
band will play "76 Trombones" as the procession travels from the Art
Center to the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Ravel reveling</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Ravel has been making the rounds during Ventura County's
new classical music season. The opening concert for the New West
Symphony was teeming with the French composer's music, including
"Bolero" and two piano concertos, beautifully dispatched by popular
pianist Christopher O'Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, the much-valued chamber music group Camerata
Pacifica also weighed in on the subject in the second concert program
of its season. This one, however, moved in a very different
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Ravel's 1922 Duo for Violin and Cello, lucidly played here by
violinist Roger Wilkie and cellist John Walz, steers away from his
best-known persona as an impressionist toward tougher terrain, a
tonally restless vocabulary more reminiscent of Stravinsky's "Rite of
Spring" than anything Bo Derek might be involved with.</TE>
<TE>   This fascinating 20-minute work raises more musical questions than
it answers and demonstrates the Camerata's will to stretch audiences'
repertoire awareness. The reward, after intermission, was the
easygoing romantic flow of Tchaikovsky's Trio for Piano, Violin and
Cello, penned in homage to the composer's early friend and supporter,
Nicholas Rubinstein.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the highly applauded and popular Camerata Pacifica
returns to its original home, Santa Barbara's Lobero Theater, when
the group was known as the Bach Camerata. For the last few years, the
group has split its time between two smaller venues in Santa Barbara
and the two trusty chambers in Ventura County, the Scherr Forum
Theatre in the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza and the Meister Hall in
Ventura's Temple Beth Torah.</TE>
<TE>   Next up in the season, dissonance takes a holiday for an
all-Brahms program Nov. 9 and 10 in Thousand Oaks and Ventura,
respectively, and on Nov. 15 at the Lobero.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz note</TE>
<TE>   Jazz has been too much a stranger in Ventura lately, with the
closing of 66 California. But at least one live effort continues in
town: the Ventura Vanguard Jazz Club, which started out in the
basement room of the Laurel Theater but has become a roving entity.</TE>
<TE>   This Friday, the series picks up with a "pre-season" concert by
pianist-composer Paul Herder, a recent emigre to Ojai from the Bay
Area. Herder will present his Chamber Jazz Ensemble at the Church of
Religious Science. Joining him will be ever-versatile saxophonist Tom
Buckner and bassist Ralph Lowri.</TE>
<TE>   The official series includes the Alan Broadbent Trio (Nov. 16),
the Gerry Wiggins Trio (Feb. 1), the Bob Florence Trio (March 1), the
Pete Jolly Trio (March 29) and the Theo Saunders Sextet (April 26),
which put in a memorable performance recently at Soho in Santa
Barbara.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Posts Net Loss After Big Merger-Related Charge</HD>
<DH>Operating results improve, helped by sharply higher drug

<LD>Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks reported a hefty third-quarter loss
Wednesday due to a $3-billion charge related to its acquisition of
Immunex Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest biotechnology company reported a net loss of
$2.6 billion, or $2.10 a share, reversing net income of $330 million,
or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. The write-off exceeded Amgen's
July estimate of $2.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The one-time charge swamped improved operating results led by
higher sales of Amgen's newest drugs. Amgen said that excluding the
write-off and other noncash charges, it would have reported earnings
of $437 million, or 34 cents a share, for the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue rose 49% to $1.5 billion from $1 billion, a result of the
acquisition and the launch of new medications. Drug sales rose 53% to
$1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said it expects drug sales to grow in the high-30% range for
2002, up from the previous estimate of mid-20% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive Kevin Sharer said the company had a
strong quarter with sales of Neulasta, a medication for
chemotherapy-related infections, exceeding expectations. "It
indicates a strong future," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the write-off, Sharer said the higher figure reflected a
closer examination of Immunex's business and did not contain any
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said combined sales of its anti-anemia drugs Epogen and
Aranesp rose 29% to $672 million. Aranesp sales for the quarter were
$114 million, driven by use in oncology. Amgen has high hopes for
Aranesp, a competitor to Procrit, a $4-billion-a-year drug that
Johnson &amp; Johnson markets under a license from Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Neulasta and its first-generation product, Neupogen, rose
a combined 32% to $474 million. Amgen said it expects sales of the
anti-infection drugs to grow in the low- to mid-30% range, up from
its previous estimate of mid-20% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Enbrel, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment acquired in the
Immunex deal that closed July 15, were $158 million. Amgen said it
expects sales to be at or below the low end of its previous 2002
sales estimate of $800 million to $850 million, in the midst of a
year-long shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen confirmed the number of patients on Enbrel fell from 79,000
in June, but did not provide an new number. In early November, the
Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to inspect a factory in
Rhode Island that will double the amount of Enbrel available, Amgen
said. Sharer said he continues to believe the FDA will approve the
factory in the first quarter of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen did not affirm previous Enbrel sales estimates of $1.2
billion to $1.4 billion in 2003 and $3 billion in 2005. The company
said it would update its forecast near the end of November.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, Chiron Corp., the fourth-largest biotechnology
company, said third-quarter income rose 58% on higher sales of its
blood-testing equipment and a cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   The Emeryville-based company reported profit of $83.6 million, or
44 cents a share, up from $52.9 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 22% to $368.5 million from $302 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron said sales of its newest product, the Proclex
blood-screening test for HIV and hepatitis C, more than doubled to
$36 million. Sales of Proleukin, for skin and kidney cancer, also
doubled to $32 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccine sales rose 9% in the quarter to $126 million. Chiron said
it expects sales of its flu vaccine to increase by 25% during the flu
season, which peaks in February.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen and Chiron announced results after the markets closed. In
Nasdaq trading, Amgen shares rose 20 cents to $50 and Chiron shares
sank 86 cents to $41.36. In after-hours trading, Amgen rose to $51.49
and Chiron fell to $40.</TE>

<HD>State Treasurer Puts Brokerage on Notice</HD>
<DH>Angelides, pushing firms to adopt reforms, says he may
suspend HSBC from working with Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- California Treasurer Phil Angelides may suspend a large
financial services firm from doing business with the state over what
he said was the company's refusal to adopt new stock analyst reforms.</LD>
<LD>   Angelides also is expected to send letters today to 50 other
securities firms warning of similar action if they do not adopt
reforms by Jan. 15.</LD>
<LD>   The moves are part of an effort by Angelides to force Wall Street
to institute tough new rules governing the conduct of their stock
analysts.</LD>
<TE>   He is trying to use California's clout as a major player in the
municipal bond market to ensure that investment banks adopt
meaningful reforms after a succession of scandals that have eroded
investor trust in Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter Wednesday, Angelides told HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
that he would bar the firm from doing brokerage work for the state
unless it agrees by mid-November to enact reforms involving analyst
independence.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for HSBC, a New York-based institutional brokerage,
said the firm recently adopted the changes and was in the process of
notifying Angelides that it had done so.</TE>
<TE>   Several government investigations have turned up evidence that
stock analysts in the late 1990s often recommended stocks of dubious
merit to investors as a way to lure investment banking work to their
firms.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators are holding settlement talks in which
major Wall Street firms probably would agree to pay large fines and
boost analyst independence.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting between regulators and representatives of the leading
firms is scheduled for today in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt on Wednesday urging that the SEC quickly
adopt strict analyst rules.</TE>
<TE>   Until new standards are developed, Angelides is trying to force
firms to make changes by threatening to withhold business from them.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides sent letters in July to 54 firms that either underwrite
California bonds or provide brokerage services to the state.</TE>
<TE>   He demanded that they adopt reforms that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
agreed to with New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer. The reforms include
separating stock research from investment banking and prohibiting
bankers from controlling analyst compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The firms replied that they had either made the reforms or would
do so by Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   When Angelides studied the responses, however, he found that only
three had fully complied.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that we're not just getting lip service,"
Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   HSBC is one of many firms that trade securities as part of
California's management of its short-term finances.</TE>
<TE>   The state did transactions worth $8.4 billion with HSBC between
1997 and this year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 53 brokerages the state dealt with last fiscal year, HSBC
was ranked No. 14 based on dollar volume.</TE>
<TE>   The HSBC spokeswoman said the firm recently had come into full
compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "We very much put an emphasis on integrity," she said.</TE>

<HD>AOL to Restate Results Due to Internet Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Acknowledging deeper problems at America Online than
previously reported, AOL Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that it
would restate eight quarters of financial results and reduce its
revenue by $190 million, as part of an in-house review of its
troubled Internet unit, which also is the focus of federal probes.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, strong earnings for movies, cable TV, broadcasting and
publishing helped offset a sharp advertising slowdown at America
Online, enabling AOL Time Warner to eke out a third-quarter profit of
$57 million, or 1 cent per share, as contrasted with a loss of $997
million, or 22 cents per share, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest media and entertainment firm said that its
quarterly revenue rose 10% to $9.9 billion, from $9.1 billion a year
ago. AOL Time Warner's EBITDA , or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- a common profit yardstick for media
companies -- fell to 19 cents a share from 24 cents a share a year
earlier. Both matched the expectations of Wall Street analysts.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the flat results, AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard
D. Parsons stuck to an earlier projection that the company would
finish the full year with 5% to 8% growth in revenue and about 5%
growth in EBITDA.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call with financial analysts, Parsons said
that the company's internal review turned up "several more"
advertising deals at the American Online unit for which revenue had
been improperly booked. In August, the company revealed that three
deals at the Internet unit involved $49 million in wrongly booked
revenue. That same month Parsons acknowledged that the company was
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner announced the results for the quarter ended Sept.
30 after the close of the stock market Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares rose 3 cents Wednesday to $13.53 on the New
York Stock Exchange. In after-market trading, after the restatement
and earnings results, the shares gained sharply to $14.45. The stock
is still down about 55% this year, largely because of investor
concerns about America Online -- not only the federal investigations
but plunging ad sales and sharply lower subscriber growth.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, America Online's revenue dropped 7% to
$2.22 billion, as ad sales fell 48%.</TE>
<TE>   Reviving the Internet unit is the company's top operating
priority, Parsons said, but he deferred any discussion of specifics
to Dec. 3, when the company will unveil a strategic plan that the
division's executives have been working on for months.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep delaying announcing a strategy or answering questions
about AOL in any concrete manner, but investors remain impatient,"
Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Frederick W. Moran said Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The restatements announced Wednesday will lower AOL Time Warner's
previously reported revenue by $190 million for the two-years from
July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002, or about 1%. The biggest change
will be for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2000, with a drop in revenue
of $66 million. The restatements also will reduce the company's
EBITDA by $97 million.</TE>
<TE>   The in-house probe of America Online is continuing, but Parsons
said the company doesn't expect any further restatements.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the total amount of the restatement represents a
small portion of America Online's total revenues during the period,
we have taken, and do take, the matter very seriously," Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   The restatements result from information and analysis that wasn't
available in August, he added. Since then, Parsons said, the firm's
in-house investigators have examined deals going back to mid-1999,
involving 70% of AOL's advertising and commerce revenue over that
period.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons did not identify any of the companies involved in the ad
deals with AOL and declined to provide further details, citing the
federal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, two former executives of Homestore Inc., an Internet
real-estate firm that was a former advertising partner of America
Online, pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy to try to boost
Homestore's stock price by inflating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Wayne H. Pace also warned Wednesday that
the company could take another substantial "asset-impairment charge"
later this year to reflect the declining value of the online
business. The firm already took a $54-billion impairment charge this
year.</TE>

<HD>California Kicks Off 1st Part of Bond Sale</HD>
<DH>Traders say demand for $4.25 billion in securities bodes
well for future issues. Proceeds will repay state coffers for power
purchases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California sold the first phase of its long-awaited $11.9-billion
power bond deal Wednesday, as about 40 large bond mutual funds
snapped up $4.25 billion of the adjustable-rate securities in just a
few hours.</LD>
<LD>   "We were extremely pleased with investor demand and the breadth of
market interest," said state Treasurer Phil Angelides. "Today's
market response validates the hard work and perseverance which has
been brought to this transaction."</LD>
<LD>   Proceeds from the $11.9-billion power bond sale will repay loans
from banks and the state's general fund that helped the state
purchase power during California's energy crisis in 2001. The
customers of the state's major utilities will pay off the bonds
through surcharges of $2.50 to $3.50 in their monthly utility bills.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's successful sale bodes well for the state's planned
sale of $6.75 billion of fixed-rate bonds and $900 million of taxable
bonds during the week of Nov. 4, traders said. The fixed-rate portion
is expected to draw interest from individual investors throughout the
state, who would not have to pay state and federal taxes on interest
from the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The $4.25 billion in variable- rate bonds were priced to yield
1.80%. Demand exceeded supply, with about $1 billion in orders that
could not be filled, bankers said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the high demand, the state had to pay a slightly higher
rate than the 1.75% it currently pays on similar securities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a better credit at a good rate," said Todd Pardula,
portfolio manager of the California Tax-Free Money Fund for American
Century Investments in Mountain View, Calif. "We thought the deal
looked attractive, so we participated. We haven't heard how much we
got yet."</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Galiani, managing director for Wells Capital Management
in San Francisco, which manages more than $12 billion of securities,
said his firm opted not to buy the bonds. He called the pricing "too
aggressive," meaning he thought the yields were too low given the
risks.</TE>
<TE>   "However, the underwriters would say the fact they got the deal
done at this rate bodes well for sale of the fixed-rate portion,"
Galiani said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is next month's sale that most of the bond market is
awaiting -- $7.65 billion of bonds, $900 million of which are
taxable. The bulk of the $6.75-billion tax-free fixed-rate portion is
backed by a letter of credit or other guarantee to ensure that
investors get repaid if something goes wrong, bankers said. The real
test will be how the bonds without the extra guarantees sell, bankers
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The market as a whole has had a hugely positive response to the
sale," said Peter Hill, managing director and head of public finance
for J.P. Morgan, the lead underwriter for the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "They understand the [bonds] and have bought into the state
treasurer's and the PUC's plan of finance," he said, referring to the
state's Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   To attract individual investors in November to the fixed-rate
bonds, the state will allow orders from individual customers at least
a day before big institutional investors such as mutual funds and
insurance companies can buy the bonds, Hill said. Bonds will be sold
in denominations as low as $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The tax advantages of investing in municipal bonds can be
powerful. For a married couple in the 36.5% combined federal and
state marginal tax bracket (that bracket begins at taxable income of
about $112,000), a California muni yield of 5% is equivalent to a
fully taxable yield of 7.9%, according to the California Municipal
Bond Advisor newsletter in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are enough people looking for yield right now that they
will buy these bonds," said Robert Gore, partner and manager of the
municipal bond department for Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But given the obstacles the deal has faced, he said, "I don't see
a groundswell of interest."</TE>
<TE>   The bonds, expected in May 2001, have been delayed for more than a
year by political and legal wrangling. The bonds carry
investment-grade ratings from three Wall Street credit-rating firms
and are being sold by the state's Department of Water Resources,
which began buying power for the utilities in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric unit of PG&amp;E Corp.
filed a lawsuit challenging a plan to use utility revenue to back the
bonds. Although the lawsuit did not cause credit raters to change
their ratings on the bonds, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. stated Monday in
a report that if a court should decide that the revenue backing the
bonds was "materially 'unjust and unreasonable,' the implication for
credit quality could be severe."</TE>

<HD>Activity Taking Flight at Edwards Once More</HD>
<DH>Upsurge in Testing of Military Aircraft Gives Economic
Boost to Antelope Valley</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the cockpit of an F-16, the Mojave Desert is an unrelenting sea
of brown -- flat and seemingly lifeless. But as the pilot prepares to
land, the bustle of Edwards Air Force Base suddenly springs into
view.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of feet below, construction workers are putting the
finishing touches on a new hangar for the world's first aircraft to
bear laser weapons. Another crew huddles around a B-52 bomber,
fitting it with new computers. As they work, an F/A-22 jet fighter
streaks by, generating a teeth-rattling sonic boom.</LD>
<LD>   After downsizing for most of the 1990s, Edwards is flying high
again, developing and testing the world's most advanced aircraft --
and providing a potent boost to the Antelope Valley economy.</LD>
<TE>   The base has added 1,000 civilian employees in the last year, and
its budget is on pace to exceed last year's by more than 50%. For the
first time in a long time, officials are fretting about heavy morning
traffic that has become increasingly common on the main road leading
into the base.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, money is
pouring into Edwards to speed development of new aircraft and weapon
systems. Virtually every piece of airborne equipment used in
Afghanistan was developed and tested at Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   The base got a big lift Wednesday when President Bush signed a
$355.1-billion defense spending bill, the largest increase in two
decades. The budget, which reflects an increase of 12%, provides a
significant boost for development including the F/A-22 and the F-35
joint strike fighter, both of which are being developed and tested at
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next several years, our prospects look pretty bright,"
said Maj. Gen. Wilbert "Doug" Pearson, the new base commander who in
a 1985 test at Edwards became the first pilot to shoot down an
orbiting satellite. "We're seeing a dramatic increase in people's
understanding of our mission."</TE>
<TE>   To maintain the momentum, the usually secretive base is holding
its first conference for aerospace companies today, hoping to drum up
more business amid fears of repeating the boom-and-bust cycles that
typically followed other defense buildups. Base officials will show
off their testing facilities to Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop
Grumman Corp. and others, in hopes of getting more work for Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Edwards is bringing back its famed air show, an
event that drew half a million people in the past but whose
attendance had dwindled to barely 100,000 before it was canceled last
year after the terrorist attacks. With renewed interest in the
military since the attacks, Edwards officials believe the air show
could draw as many as 250,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback at Edwards is welcome news for the long-suffering
Antelope Valley, whose residents are seeing a resurgence in the local
economy. Edwards, with a population of 16,000 people, is the largest
employer in the region, which includes Palmdale and Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's booming again," said David Myers, president of the Greater
Antelope Valley Economic Alliance. Combined with an influx of people
from the Los Angeles area looking for affordable homes, "houses are
selling as soon as they come on the market."</TE>
<TE>   The precise effect of the buildup at Edwards is unclear. The most
recent study by Myers' group was conducted in 2000, when it estimated
that Edwards pumped more than $1.5 billion into the local economy.
Even so, there are other signs of Edwards' positive effect.</TE>
<TE>   Home sales and prices, for example, are up substantially -- which
Myers attributes partly to increased activity at Edwards. Sales of
new and existing homes in Lancaster and Palmdale rose 15.5% in the
first nine months of the year compared with the same period last
year. By comparison, home sales were up 8.4% in Los Angeles County
overall.</TE>
<TE>   While Edwards officials are reluctant to say or predict how many
new jobs have been or would be created on base -- many are for
classified programs that are not publicly acknowledged -- Antelope
Valley officials believe the base already has added about 1,000 jobs
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I do see employment figures rising slowly but steadily over the
next several years as a number of our programs begin to ramp up,"
Pearson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley's aerospace boom isn't confined to Edwards. At
nearby Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale Airport, defense contractors
design aircraft and new weapon systems that are tested at Edwards.
Employment at Plant 42 rose this year to 9,000 from 7,000, Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Edwards, the test flight program for the F/A-22, the
sophisticated fighter that can fly at supersonic speed without using
afterburners, is seen adding 70 more engineers to its roster of 800
people in the next six months. Another several hundred people will be
added when the F-35, the next-generation fighter jet that is also
known as the joint strike fighter, begins test flights at Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest growth may come from developing unmanned airplanes
such as the Global Hawk spy plane and the X-45 unmanned fighter as
well as from new spacecraft that are under development to replace the
space shuttle. Edwards also is home to NASA's Dryden Flight Research
Center, which works with the Air Force to develop aircraft for
commercial and scientific projects.</TE>
<TE>   Outside observers say Edwards also has added a number of
classified programs including developing a hypersonic spy plane
capable of reaching speeds of up to 5,000 mph. It apparently is
housed in an underground hangar and comes out only at night, similar
to the way the precursor to the F-117 stealth fighter was developed
in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   What is known is that the base's operating budget is increasing at
rates not seen since the 1980s. Spending grew to $207.9 million last
year, from $197 million in 2000. For the first six months of fiscal
2002, the operations budget for Edwards reached $156.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the value of contracts awarded to base suppliers
have been rising, from $287 million last year to $301 million.
Including individual procurement contracts awarded to defense
contractors developing airplanes at Edwards, Myers estimates that
about $765 million has been funneled to Edwards in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards hasn't been this busy in a while. Test programs fell by
one-third in the 1990s as its fleet of testing and support airplanes
dwindled from about 175 to 100.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the number of major test programs conducted at Edwards
has been steadily rising from a low of 68 in 1997 to 80 last year and
91 so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Edwards in the 1950s and 1960s was a household term," said John
Haire , a longtime Edwards spokesman. "We sort of lost that even
though we have as many X-planes [experimental] today as we had when
we were flying the X-15."</TE>
<TE>   The X-15 rocket-powered plane, which flew in the 1950s, shattered
speed and altitude records, climbing to 354,000 feet and reaching
speeds of 4,520 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was first used in the 1930s as a bombing range by the Army
Air Corps. Targets resembling ships were built for use in bombing and
gunnery practice. They still are visible from the air.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to its remote location, the long runway and weather
conditions that allow for year-round flying, Edwards quickly became
an ideal place for testing new airplanes and for setting numerous
records.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing that man has done can beat what nature has built at
Edwards," said Paul Metz, Lockheed Martin's director of flight
testing for the F-35 and former chief test pilot for the F/A-22.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to all the major test centers around the world and none
have the confluence of conditions that you have at Edwards: the long
runaway on the lake bed, the clear sky and the environment to test
far away from high density population. That will always draw people
back to Edwards."</TE>

<HD>Kilroy Appeals Thomas Project</HD>
<DH>Both sides continue their feud over the development of the
corporate campus in El Segundo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A long-running feud between two prominent Los Angeles-area developers
flared up again this week when Kilroy Realty Corp. and its allies
filed a last-minute court appeal and raised new environmental
concerns over a proposed El Segundo office development by rival
Thomas Properties Group.</LD>
<LD>   The latest maneuver in the unusual and costly battle will keep the
proposed 46-acre El Segundo Corporate Campus in legal limbo for at
least another six months, according to attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   Kilroy and the Citizens Against Gridlock in El Segundo on Monday
appealed a decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Yaffe
to dismiss their lawsuit, which had charged the city of El Segundo
with failing to, among other things, fully study the environmental
and traffic effects of the multimillion-dollar project and to allow
for sufficient public comment. The decision now will be reviewed by
the California Court of Appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "Our attorneys feel we have excellent grounds for appeal," said
Hugh Greenup, executive vice president at Kilroy, a publicly traded
real estate investment trust. "Our issue is that the city did not
conduct an appropriate review of this project."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of privately held Thomas Properties said the
lawsuit is without merit and repeated past charges that Kilroy, one
of El Segundo's biggest office landlords, is simply trying to keep
competitors out of the market. The Thomas project is to be built on
the site of a former aerospace plant located in the eastern part of
the city near Nash Street and Mariposa Avenue. The site sits near an
office complex owned by Kilroy.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is a smoke screen to hide their true
intention, which is to quash competition," said Thomas Properties
attorney Dale Goldsmith.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have been at it for more than a year and have waged a
costly and high-profile campaign to influence elected officials,
voters and the courts. This June, Kilroy and the citizens group,
which is funded primarily by the developer, tried unsuccessfully to
overturn the city's approval of the project in a special referendum,
which saw both sides combined spend in excess of $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The protracted contest has surprised many in the real estate
business, where developers rarely wage such public and costly battles
against rival projects.</TE>
<TE>   "They often won't do it because of [potential] retributions on the
next project," said Los Angeles developer Cliff Goldstein at the firm
J.H. Snyder Co. "You can create a vicious circle chasing each other
and destroying each other's business."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to filing its appeal, the citizens group also called
on Thomas Properties to post a $350-million bond to protect the city
from potential litigation that could arise from exposure to toxic air
emissions on youth soccer fields that will be built on a portion of
the El Segundo Corporate Campus. The group's officials claimed the
city had failed to seek such legal protection.</TE>
<TE>   But El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon said such a bond was unnecessary
because environmental experts hired by the city had determined that
concerns about contamination did not exist. "This is just one more of
Kilroy's efforts to scare our community," said Gordon.</TE>

<HD>Record Verdict Against Ford Allowed to Stand</HD>
<DH>State Supreme Court declines to review $290-million
judgment in deadly Bronco crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to review a
$290-million punitive damages verdict against Ford Motor Co.,
allowing to stand what the automaker described as the largest
personal injury award in U.S. history to be affirmed on appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-3 decision, issued without comment, left Ford clinging to
hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case, which involved
three family members who died in 1993 when the roof of their Bronco
sport utility vehicle collapsed in a rollover wreck.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an extreme and blatantly unconstitutional punitive damage
award," Ford lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous said. "We plan to ask the
U.S. Supreme Court to overturn it."</LD>
<TE>   Fourteen business groups and companies, including the U.S. and
California Chambers of Commerce, the National Assn. of Manufacturers,
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Aetna Life Insurance Co.
and ExxonMobil Corp., had filed friend-of-the-court petitions with
the Supreme Court, supporting Ford's claim that the verdict was
"grossly excessive" and a threat to all California businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs lawyer Joseph W. Carcione Jr. called it a "just
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, said the decision was "the price Ford pays for lobbying"
safety regulators to preserve "a weak roof-crush standard." Ditlow
said that if motorists aren't protected by adequate safety standards,
"then it's up to the courts to do so through verdicts that force
automakers to make their products safer."</TE>
<TE>   Voting to deny Ford's petition were Chief Justice Ronald M. George
and Justices Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, Ming W. Chin and Carlos R.
Moreno. Favoring review were Justices Janice R. Brown, Joyce L.
Kennard and Marvin R. Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by Juan, Evangelina and Maria Romo, siblings
who survived the June 1993 crash on Interstate 5 near Turlock that
killed their parents, Ramon, 39, and Salustia, 40, and brother
Ramiro, 18.</TE>
<TE>   The family's 1978 Bronco had a metal-and-fiberglass roof, a design
that Ford strengthened in later years but without recalling the
earlier models.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy trial in Stanislaus County Superior Court in 1999,
the jury awarded $5 million in compensatory and $290 million in
punitive damages, based on findings that the vehicle was defective
and Ford guilty of malicious conduct.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, trial Judge Roger M. Beauchesne threw out the
punitives portion of the verdict, ruling that the jury's
deliberations had been "infested with passion and prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   Among other instances of misconduct, Beauchesne said, a juror told
fellow jurors of a "morbid nightmare ... in which her child and the
other jurors' children were killed by a repeatedly rolling-over
Bronco while Ford attorneys and witnesses, armed with guns, mockingly
chanted, 'Where's the proof? Where's the proof.' "</TE>
<TE>   But in a scathing ruling in which it compared Ford's behavior to
manslaughter, the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno reinstated
the award in June, saying there was no proof the jury had failed to
decide the case on its merits.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it obvious that putting on the market a motor vehicle
with a known propensity to roll over and, while [giving] the vehicle
the appearance of sturdiness, consciously deciding not to provide
adequate crush protection to properly belted passengers ...
constitutes despicable conduct," the court said. "Such corporate
conduct can constitute involuntary manslaughter."</TE>
<TE>   A proliferation of large punitive damage verdicts against
corporate defendants is an issue of growing legal controversy. The
U.S. Supreme Court has declared that punitive damages should bear a
reasonable relationship to the amount of the compensatory award.
Without setting formal limits, the court has suggested that punitives
exceed compensatory damage awards by no more than a ratio of 3 to 1
or 4 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   In the Romo case, punitives were 58 times the compensatory
damages.</TE>
<TE>   The case also has highlighted a fierce debate over whether
stronger roofs should be required on vehicles. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration is considering beefing up its
30-year-old roof strength standard, though automakers are resisting,
saying the current standard is adequate.</TE>

<HD>Offshore Tax Cheats Include Big Names, IRS Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service has identified actors, doctors, lawyers,
accountants, attorneys and high-end business people in its
wide-ranging crackdown on offshore tax cheats, who are believed to be
underpaying their taxes by an estimated $70 billion annually.</LD>
<LD>   "These are names you would recognize," said Dale Hart, a deputy
IRS commissioner. "We are seeing people you would consider very high
profile. We have hundreds of cases under investigation, and we
believe there are billions of dollars at stake here."</LD>
<LD>   The IRS is prohibited by federal law from disclosing the names of
taxpayers who are under investigation but are not yet indicted.
However, in an interview Wednesday, Hart said hundreds of
investigations had been launched as the result of a five-year effort
to find and identify 1 million to 2 million individuals who are
hiding assets offshore to evade taxes.</LD>
<TE>   It's not illegal to hold money in an offshore account. However,
any income earned by a U.S. resident from an offshore account must be
reported to the IRS. The government believes that about $3 trillion
in unreported assets are held in secret accounts in tax-haven
countries, costing the U.S. Treasury an estimated $70 billion
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks ago, the IRS asked a federal judge in Los
Angeles to force local companies including Hughes Electronics Corp.;
Walt Disney Co.; International PADI Inc., a diving firm with offices
in Rancho Santa Margarita; and the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly
Hills to turn over transaction records on customers whose credit
cards are issued by banks in Antigua, Barbuda, Bahamas and the Cayman
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   It was the latest in a series of "John Doe" summonses aimed at
gathering credit card charge slips with the names and sig- natures of
individuals holding money in offshore accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Credit cards have become the primary means for U.S. tax scofflaws
to get access to the money they hold offshore, IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two years, the IRS has subpoenaed information from
major credit card issuers -- MasterCard, Visa and American Express
Co. -- to obtain millions of charge slips and credit card numbers.
However, in many instances, the charges are put through without the
name of the account holder.</TE>
<TE>   By gathering the charge information from vendors, the agency hopes
to connect charges with names and create a paper trail sufficient to
launch both civil and criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are learning a lot from the investigations that we have in
stream," Hart said, "and we are going to learn a lot more when we get
results from the merchant summonses."</TE>

<HD>Hilton Doubles Net Income on Cost Cuts</HD>
<DH>A lower tax rate also contributes to gains. But a
business-travel slump leads the hotel operator to trim forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp. said Wednesday cost cutting and a lower tax rate
helped the hotel operator to more than double net income in the third
quarter, despite declines in room rates and a stubborn
business-travel slump.</LD>
<LD>   The Beverly Hills firm said it earned $48 million, or 13 cents a
share, up from $21 million, or 6 cents, a year ago. Revenue edged
down 1% to $934 million.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach said Hilton cut expenses by
consolidating laundry facilities, paying down debt and centralizing
2,000 properties into one accounting system. Much of the cost cutting
came after the Sept. 11 attacks, in part to avoid massive job cuts
that plagued the tourism industry, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the third-largest U.S. hotel company lowered its forecast
for the fourth quarter and 2003, citing the shrinking business-travel
market and its inability to raise room prices. In the third quarter,
overall room rates declined 3.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken a conservative view for the balance of this year and
into 2003," Bollenbach told analysts Wednesday. "Business is getting
better, but the improvement is not as dramatic as I thought it would
be at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate travel to cities such as New York, San Francisco,
Phoenix and San Jose remains below 2000 levels, forcing Hilton and
other hotel companies to offer rooms at lower rates to tourists and
convention goers. That has allowed Hilton to increase its overall
occupancy rate to 71.4%, up 3 percentage points over a year ago. The
average daily room rate, however, fell from $125.63 to $121.06.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton said it would earn "in the mid to high 50-cent range" for
2003, with revenue of about $4.1 billion. Fourth-quarter bookings are
expected to increase 2% over the same period a year ago, but rates
probably will remain flat for the year. Its outlook for 2003 fell
short of the 60 cents per share estimated by Thomson First Call
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which runs the Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites brands,
ranks behind Marriott International Inc. and Starwood Hotels &amp;
Resorts Worldwide Inc. in sales. Hilton plans to add at least 100
hotels and 12,000 rooms in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an uncertain market that is difficult to project long term,"
said William Marks, an analyst with JMP Securities. "There's not much
more [Hilton] can do."</TE>
<TE>   Hilton said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and noncash items was 9 cents, a penny less than
analysts' projections.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton shares fell 4 cents to $12.04 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>

<HD>'Jenny Jones' Not Liable for Guest's Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Jenny Jones Show" was not responsible for the death of a guest,
the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday, throwing out a
$29.3-million jury verdict.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Jonathan Schmitz shot and killed Scott Amedure three days
after they appeared on a "Jenny Jones Show" segment on confessions of
secret admirers. The segment never aired.</LD>
<LD>   Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder and felony
possession of a firearm and sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Amedure's family filed a wrongful death action against Warner
Bros., a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc., the "Jenny Jones Show," and
the show's producer, Telepictures. The family contended that Schmitz
was "ambushed" because the show's producers did not tell Schmitz that
same sex crushes were the theme of the show -- an allegation denied
by the show.</TE>
<TE>   But the court ruled that the show and its producers "had no duty
to anticipate and prevent the act of murder committed by Schmitz
three days after leaving defendants' studio and hundreds of miles
away." The judges wrote that Schmitz was neither "visibly upset nor
dangerous during the taping of the show."</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. deputy counsel Zazi Pope said: "One of the things
this verdict stands for is that individuals are accountable for their
own actions. For the show to be able to predict and prevent that kind
of conduct would be completely untenable."</TE>
<TE>   Jones released a statement saying, "Scott Amedure's murder was a
horrible tragedy, but I have always believed that it was
fundamentally wrong and unfair to blame the show."</TE>

<HD>Listen.com Cuts Deals With Two Big Labels</HD>
<DH>Universal and Warner will allow users of the firm's online
jukebox to make permanent copies of thousands of songs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet music distributor Listen.com of San Francisco said it
reached deals with two major record companies that would let
subscribers make permanent copies of some of the songs on Listen's
online jukebox.</LD>
<LD>   The agreements with Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group and
AOL Time Warner's Warner Music Group add an important new dimension
to Listen's service: For an additional fee, subscribers will be able
to listen to some major-label songs when they are not connected to
the Internet. Starting today, subscribers can record tens of
thousands of the labels' songs onto CDs at 99 cents apiece.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hugely important," said analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a
technology research and consulting firm. "Portability and depth and
breadth of the catalog are going to be the two most important things
for music services. And getting [CD recording] into the service gets
them partly down that path."</LD>
<TE>   Listen's Rhapsody, an online jukebox and radio service that lets
subscribers hear songs on demand, is the only authorized subscription
service that includes songs from all five major labels. That
distinction is expected to vanish soon, however, as two ventures
owned by the record labels -- Pressplay and MusicNet -- fill the
holes in their catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   The labels have been slow to grant licenses that permit CD
burning, in part because they would prefer downloaded music files to
remain in copy-protected formats. Standard CDs have no such
protection.</TE>
<TE>   But in a recent survey of more than 2,000 adults and teenagers who
use the Internet, McNealy said, GartnerG2 found that "if consumers
perceive that things are being restricted, then they have a problem
with it."</TE>

<HD>Shipping Group Offers Evidence of 'Slowdowns'</HD>
<DH>The Pacific Maritime Assn. files letter to the Justice
Department on productivity since docks reopened. The longshore union
says claim is 'baseless.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shipping industry has turned over to the U.S. Justice Department
what it calls proof of a "concerted, systematic work slowdown" by the
longshore union since West Coast ports were reopened under a federal
court order Oct. 9.</LD>
<LD>   Despite an injunction calling for work to resume at "a normal and
reasonable rate of speed," the Pacific Maritime Assn. said
productivity per worker dropped by up to a third in the first week
after the docks reopened. The shipping group said the slower pace
cost shipping lines and terminal operators millions of dollars and
prevented the clearing of a massive backlog of containers.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union said the claim was
"completely baseless" and part of a campaign by the Pacific Maritime
Assn. to discredit and weaken the union.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department officials would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, they made available a letter sent to the shipping group
and the union Tuesday, asking for further documentation by noon
Friday and warning each not to destroy any relevant evidence,
including internal e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   "These are serious allegations," wrote Washington-based Deputy
Assistant Atty. Gen. Shannen W. Coffin. "I wish to afford both
parties the opportunity to substantiate their positions ... before
considering the possibility of seeking judicial relief." Coffin could
decide to seek a contempt order from the court, which could lead to
monetary penalties as well as further, more specific court orders.</TE>
<TE>   The maritime association filed the eight-page letter containing
the charges Friday, but it was not made public until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping group said it told the Justice Department that
average productivity per worker dropped 34% in Oakland, 29% in
Portland, 27% in Seattle, 19% in Tacoma and 9% in Los Angeles-Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Although the drop in the Southland was relatively modest, Pacific
Maritime Assn. spokesman Steve Sugerman said the size of the port
complex magnified the losses.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the productivity drop does not measure the production lost
when workers do not report for work or when crews are dismissed for
lack of key personnel.</TE>
<TE>   A terminal operator in Los Angeles, who asked not to be named,
conceded that the high volume and congestion at the moment complicate
the task of sorting out whether there is an orchestrated slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's easy to see it's there," he said. "But maybe not to a
judge."</TE>
<TE>   The shipping lines locked out union workers last month after a
series of alleged union slowdowns that cut productivity by as much as
50%.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from retailers and manufacturers, President Bush
invoked the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act to seek the federal
injunction that forced the ports to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   The union and shipping group have been in contract negotiations
since May, and have deadlocked on the implementation of new
technology that would eliminate jobs. Talks with a federal mediator
are scheduled to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ports reopened, the union said congestion and spot
shortages of labor and equipment -- and not a union mandate -- have
slowed the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing a game," said Ramon Ponce de Leon, president of
ILWU Local 13 in Los Angeles, which filed a grievance last week
claiming employers were not ordering sufficient workers in order to
sabotage the union's efforts to clear out the port. "They're
manufacturing a worker-shortage crisis, then going to court and
saying we're slowing down, and that is a crock."</TE>
<TE>   The shipping group, however, said it had clear evidence of union
slowdowns. It said key equipment operators have not been dispatched
to many terminals, forcing the terminal operators to send home entire
crews of workers who depend on that equipment.</TE>
<TE>   It also noted wide swings in productivity from terminal to
terminal and shift to shift, indicating that workers can move
equipment at a normal speed when they so chose.</TE>
<TE>   "When the union wants to be productive it is productive," Sugerman
said. "We've had terminals operating at 110% of normal, then the next
day drop to 60%. The union's own good work counters all the
explanations for why it can't do the work."</TE>

<HD>Steinberg Partner Testifies in Trial</HD>
<DH>Jeffrey Moorad, a baseball agent at the firm, testifies
that the departure of David Dunn hurt the agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fighting back tears on the witness stand, the longtime partner of
Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg testified Wednesday that
their firm suffered a "devastating" hit when a group of disgruntled
agents and employees abruptly quit last year and took 50 marquee
football clients with them.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey S. Moorad, who represents baseball stars such as Mo Vaughn
and Luis Gonzalez and has been Steinberg's partner for more than a
decade, said the departure of David Dunn and five others "carved the
heart" out of the firm's football practice, then considered the best
in the sports representation industry.</LD>
<LD>   When asked how valuable Dunn had been at "maintenance" -- keeping
football players happy between contract negotiations -- Moorad's eyes
welled as he tried to compose himself. "David was extremely good at
taking care of the players and was a star in that area in the
practice," said Moorad, now president and chief operating officer of
Assante Sports Management Group. Assante Corp. bought the Steinberg
firm in 1999 for $74 million.</LD>
<TE>   The firm, then known as Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn, sued Dunn and
his firm, Athletes First, in Los Angeles federal court for $40
million, claiming interference with contracts, fraud and false
advertising. Dunn has countersued for invasion of privacy and false
advertising. Steinberg's attorneys are completing their case. Dunn's
attorneys are expected to call several pro football players as
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The trial took an unexpected turn Wednesday when one juror sent a
note to U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew saying he had attended
high school in Chicago with the father of Dunn's associate John M.
"Joby" Branion. The juror volunteered the information after jurors
watched Branion's videotaped deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Lew was informed by Dunn's attorneys that the
same juror had approached a Steinberg lawyer during lunch and said:
"I wish we could talk sometime." Lew allowed the trial to proceed but
ordered the juror not to talk to the litigants.</TE>
<TE>   In his videotaped remarks, Branion described how Dunn and others
expressed happiness and "relief" when players such as Drew Bledsoe
terminated their relationship with the Steinberg firm after the
agents walked out in February 2001. In the weeks that followed,
Steinberg's firm tried to negotiate a joint venture with the
disaffected agents but, by May, the talks had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's attorneys say that all the players who followed Dunn did so
willingly. The attorneys contend that the employees and players left
because of Steinberg's alleged unprofessional behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Moorad acknowledged that numerous employees had complained about
Steinberg, whom he described as moody and undisciplined. Moorad
admitted that he has referred to his partner as "unbalanced."</TE>
<TE>   "Leigh's like a mad genius," Moorad said. "He's probably the
smartest person I've ever met.... Along with that comes a quirky
personality. It comes with the package."</TE>

<HD>A New Use for Those White Wine Spritzers?</HD>
<DH>Study finds Chardonnay kills potentially deadly bacteria,
but food safety experts are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a year dominated by news of food poisoning outbreaks and recalls,
Oregon State University food scientist Mark Daeschel has a tip for
consumers: Down a glass of Chardonnay with that burger.</LD>
<LD>   Wine, particularly white wine, the fermentation expert discovered,
kills E. coli, salmonella and other potentially deadly bacteria in
the stomach, or at least in the model stomach he created in his lab.</LD>
<LD>   Daeschel's research, which he is aiming to publish in January in
the Journal of Food Science, builds on earlier anti-microbial
research and on anecdotal evidence that suggested drinking wine with
a meal helped some people avoid food poisoning.</LD>
<TE>   He's now hoping his lab discovery will find its way into America's
kitchens. The microbiologist and part-time vintner is developing a
new kind of white wine spritzer. But rather than a drink to be
sipped, it will be a Chardonnay-based disinfectant to be sprayed on
countertops.</TE>
<TE>   Although Daeschel's discovery could be an appealing new tool in
the California wine industry's campaign to tout the health benefits
of its product, officials say they're not sure what to make of his
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to associate wine with a lifestyle that's a bit more
romantic," said Gladys Horiuchi of the Wine Institute in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Daeschel's findings have intrigued some Central
Valley farmers who are struggling to turn a profit on a surfeit of
Chardonnay, said Barry Bedwell, general manager of grape brokerage
Ciatti &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Daeschel said several California wine companies also have
expressed interest in licensing the formula he is developing for his
university as a means of disposing of their surplus or substandard
wine.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to identify those companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently there is a lot of Chardonnay in California that they
don't know what to do with," Daeschel said.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, food-safety experts greeted the discovery with a
degree of skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be much more confident in the work if it had been
conducted on a biological system," such as a rat, said Carl Winter,
director of the Food Safe program at UC Davis. There are a host of
other good and bad bacteria in a functioning stomach, he added, that
might affect the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Winter said, the best advice for consumers is to make
sure their food is fully cooked and to use better handling procedures
to avoid cross-contamination of other foods.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of creative solutions out there," Winter said. But,
he said, "We don't need to be looking for a silver bullet, when there
are tools already out there to minimize our risk" of
illness.Scientists all over the U.S. are scrambling to create novel
anti-bacterial treatments to prevent food-borne illnesses. They're
putting everything from spices to milk to mouthwash on animals and
food to kill germs.</TE>
<TE>   For his experiments, Daeschel recreated a human stomach using a
plastic bag that contained gastric juices and food. Strains of
various pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella were added along
with 50 grams of wine -- in some tests Chardonnay and in other tests
Pinot Noir, a red wine.</TE>
<TE>   The Chardonnay was more effective, Daeschel discovered, killing
salmonella bacteria in less than 30 minutes and E. coli bacteria in
less than an hour. The Pinot Noir took as long as 90 minutes to
neutralize the same bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   He found that the white wine's high malic and tartaric acids,
along with its high alcohol content, attacked and killed the germs.</TE>
<TE>   The same results, he said, could not be accomplished with other
low-acid libations such as beer or unfermented grape juice.</TE>
<TE>   Daeschel acknowledged that there is no guarantee that drinking
wine with a meal will prevent illness. And, he said, key to the
success of his experiment was the proper ratio of food to wine.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged another potential pitfall, as well: Badly
contaminated food might reach a human's small intestine before the
wine has a chance to do its work.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Restatements Rise</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One in 10 publicly traded companies made financial restatements
because of accounting irregularities in the last five years, the U.S.
General Accounting Office said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Annual restatements from accounting irregularities will increase
170% to a projected 250 by the end of 2002 from 92 in 1997, the
report says.</LD>
<LD>   The report cited weaknesses in corporate management at the
restating companies, with auditors and boards of directors failing in
their roles, along with securities analysts and credit-rating
agencies that did not find problems in time.</LD>
<TE>   The GAO report showed the restatement trend began earlier than the
spectacular 2001 implosion of Enron Corp. and this year's WorldCom
Inc. bankruptcy, with 1999 restatements jumping 71% to 174 from 102
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who requested the report, said the
findings made it more important than ever that the Securities and
Exchange Commission name persons of integrity to a new oversight
board set up under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Tuesday that it had filed 598 enforcement actions for
fiscal 2002, which ended Sept. 30, a 24% jump from 484 the year
before.</TE>

<DH>Automaker sees increase in operating profit despite tough
market conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DETROIT -- Boosted by strong results at its Chrysler unit,
DaimlerChrysler on Wednesday posted better-than-expected operating
profit for the third quarter, but the automaker joined its major U.S.
competitors with serious pension shortfalls.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, said its profit
dropped 22% to $764 million in the third quarter, compared with the
same period last year. But its operating earnings beat analysts'
expectations despite tough market conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Net income, adjusted for one-time effects, rose to $871 million,
or 88 cents a share, from 28 cents the year before. Revenue rose 1%
to $35.9 billion.</LD>
<TE>   A turnaround program at Chrysler helped the U.S. division
contribute $321 million in operating profit -- in contrast to a loss
of $264 million in the same quarter a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "The significant improvement in earnings was achieved despite the
challenging environment," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's U.S. competitors, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., have forced it to compete on costly sales incentives, such as
no-interest financing.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and GM both reported third-quarter losses last week.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's third-quarter sales rose 8% to 681,600 vehicles, which
Chief Financial Officer Manfred Gentz attributed in part to strong
demand for the Jeep Liberty, Dodge Ram and PT Cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares fell 81 cents to $37.05 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Dreyer's Quarterly Profit Jumps 71%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., the nation's largest ice cream
company, said Wednesday that third-quarter net income surged 71% as
it distributed more ice cream for competitors and paid less for
ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakland-based company, which is being acquired by Nestle's
Glendale-based Nestle Holdings division, said it earned $10.33
million, or 27 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 28, up
from $6.05 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 6.1% to
$383.6 million from $361.6 million last year.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the improvement in profit stemmed from its $14.8-million
pretax gain from lower dairy prices and increased sales of rival
brands that it distributes.</LD>
<TE>   About 45% of the company's sales came from products it sells for
other ice cream makers, while sales of its own branded products,
which make up the other 55% of the business, inched up just 2% for
the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The third quarter was a disaster," said Prudential Securities
analyst Jeffrey G. Kanter. "They completely missed expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Dreyer's was expected to earn 59 cents a share, the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives acknowledged that they missed out on sales
because they were focused on the merger and did not engage in the
same kind of promotions that rivals did.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen an unprecedented level of discounting by Unilever" to
gain market share, said Timothy Kahn, Dreyer's chief financial
officer. "It surprised us."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the discounting, he said, was on Unilever's super-premium
ice creams such as Ben &amp; Jerry's, which competes directly with
Dreyer's Dreamery and Godiva brands as well as Nestle's Haagen-Dazs.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses related to its acquisition by Nestle cost the company
$2.8 million in the third quarter and could total $30 million by the
time the two companies are integrated, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   That deal, which is still under antitrust scrutiny by the Federal
Trade Commission, probably will be completed by the end of this year
or the beginning of next year, Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the deal, announced in June, Nestle agreed to
give Dreyer's control of its U.S. ice cream business in exchange for
shares in Dreyer's that will boost its stake to 67% from 23%.</TE>
<TE>   Dreyer's shares rose 19 cents to close at $70.97 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Fed Survey Depicts a Battered Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Crutsinger</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve painted a somber picture of weak retail sales,
tough times in manufacturing and a lackluster job market in its
latest survey of business conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Many analysts said the report released Wednesday increased the
chances the Fed would cut interest rates in November.</LD>
<LD>   Compiled from information supplied by the Fed's 12 regional banks,
the survey depicted an economy that was battered in September and
early October by a host of problems, from a plunging stock market to
the West Coast dock shutdown.</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco district reported that economic activity grew
modestly in September and early October, despite slowing sales of
automobiles and smaller retail items and weak demand for manufactured
items.</TE>
<TE>   The agricultural sector was pinched by increased shipping costs
following work stoppages at West Coast ports, but the effects
elsewhere were limited.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers next meet Nov. 6, the day after voters go to the
polls, to set interest rates. The Fed has left its benchmark
overnight borrowing rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% since December,
when it made the last of 11 rate reductions aimed at lifting the
country out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation of a possible Fed rate cut increased after the
Fed's meeting Sept. 24, when two Fed policymakers dissented from the
majority decision to leave rates unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were struck by the bleak tone of the Fed survey, which is
prepared eight times a year to give policymakers a look at business
conditions around the country before their interest rate meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The document is known as the "beige book" for the color of its
cover.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Upbeat About Growth in Productivity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Crutsinger</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. workers' productivity should continue to post solid gains in
coming years, although not at the level of this year's surge, which
may be one of the strongest increases in three decades, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan, who has been a leading proponent of the view that the
country has entered a new era of stronger productivity growth, told a
conference that the productivity boom of the late 1990s has not
faltered.</LD>
<LD>   It has grown stronger over the last year, he said, even in the
face of significant economic problems.</LD>
<TE>   Greenspan said the increase in productivity -- the amount of
output per hour of work -- for this year "will almost surely be
reported as one of the largest advances, if not the largest, posted
over the past 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   Through the 12 months ended in June, productivity for nonfarm
workers has risen by a sizable 4.8%, the biggest jump for a 12-month
period since 1983. The gain is well above the improved rates of about
2.5% turned in since 1995 and far above the anemic productivity rate
of about 1.5%, which the country was saddled with for two decades
before 1995.</TE>

<HD>Standard Pacific Says Net Income Fell 14%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Strickland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homebuilder Standard Pacific Corp. said Wednesday that third-quarter
profit declined 14% because of one-time charges stemming from slowing
sales in Texas and Colorado. But the Irvine-based company raised its
earnings forecast for this year thanks to its recent expansion into
the Southeast.</LD>
<LD>   Standard Pacific reported that net income fell to $22.6 million,
or 68 cents a share, from $26.3 million, or 86 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 38% to $462 million from $334 million.</LD>
<LD>   The results included charges of $1.8 million, or 5 cents a share,
from a previously announced decision to close its Houston division,
and $3.7 million, or 11 cents a share, from projects that needed
incentives or price markdowns to sell in the Denver area.</LD>
<TE>   "We have felt the effects of regional economic slowdowns," said
Chairman Stephen Scarborough. Without the set-asides, the builder
said, it would have reported a 7% increase in earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of new homes the company delivered jumped 41% to
1,565 in the period; the number of consumers that ordered new homes
climbed 78% to 1,731; and the backlog of houses sold that are under
construction more than doubled to 3,964 from 1,890 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion into the Southeast will help boost fourth-quarter
earnings per share to $1.32 to $1.42, compared with $1.04 a year
earlier, said Andrew Parnes, a senior vice president. That, in turn,
will elevate full-year profit to $3.40 to $3.50 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Standard Pacific shares rose $1.27 to $25.39 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Results were announced after markets closed.</TE>

<LD>   But stocks rebounded as investors reacted to an earlier speech by
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said U.S. productivity probably will
be more robust than many expect, and focused on upbeat profit reports
from such companies as software maker Computer Associates
International, which raised guidance.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a great deal of apprehension -- and there's a great deal
of hope," Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany
Corp., told Reuters. "You have an intersection between hope that the
rally will continue and apprehension that this is another false
start."</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 closed 5.98 points, or 0.7%, higher, at 896.14,
bringing its cumulative gain to 15.4% since the blue-chip barometer
reached a five-year low on Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 44.11 points, or 0.5%, to
8,494.27, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index surged
27.43 points, or 2.1%, to 1,320.23.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by roughly 5 to 3 on both Nasdaq and
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the index gains, many stocks were hurt by shaky profit
reports or brokerage analyst downgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Lilly dropped $4.91 to $58.09 after trimming forecasts for the
fourth quarter, as generic competition slowed sales of its
antidepressant Prozac.</TE>
<TE>   Phone shares fell after Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery
lowered BellSouth, SBC Communications and Verizon Communications to
"equal-weight" from "overweight," saying valuations have gotten
steeper based on profit forecasts for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   SBC fell $1.20 to $25.85, BellSouth shed 49 cents to $25.80 and
Verizon lost $1.02 to $36.73.</TE>
<TE>   But big winners included Computer Associates, which climbed $2.65
to $14.75 after raising its forecast for fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Tech bellwethers Intel and Microsoft also gave the leading indexes
a major lift. Intel jumped $1.04 to $16.16 and Microsoft rallied
$1.53 to $53.20.</TE>
<TE>   Among chip equipment makers, Applied Materials soared $1.32 to
$14.41 and KLA-Tencor climbed $2.16 to $32.71 despite warning that
results in the current quarter could miss analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney helped boost the Dow, rising 69 cents to $17.80 after
Merrill Lynch increased profit estimates for the entertainment
giant's fiscal year 2003, citing an upturn in the advertising market.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were lured to the Treasury market by benchmark 10-year
note yields near seven-week highs and speculation that slow economic
growth may spur the Fed to cut interest rates in the months ahead.
The yield on the 10-year T-note slid to 4.23% from 4.26% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In foreign stock trading, Brazil's main index soared 5.5%, but in
Europe, stocks slipped 4.5% in Germany, 4.1% in France and 2.7% in
Britain.</TE>

<HD>Oakley Profit Falls but Beats Forecast</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunglass maker Oakley Inc. said Wednesday that third-quarter earnings
fell almost 15% but beat Wall Street's lowered expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County company, which also makes shoes, clothes,
watches and prescription eyewear, said profit for the quarter ended
Sept. 30 was $12.3 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $14.4
million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's third
quarter included a benefit of 2 cents a share from a reduced tax
rate.</LD>
<LD>   A consensus of analysts from Thomson First Call expected earnings
of 16 cents a share. Oakley warned last month that it would not meet
its initial third-quarter earnings expectation of 27 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Sales for the quarter rose 16% to $131.9 million from $114 million
last year, when Oakley was embroiled in a dispute with Sunglass Hut,
its largest customer.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley's stock rose 14% to close at $11.28, up $1.38, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Kristine Koerber, with WR Hambrecht &amp; Co., said the stock
price may have jumped partly because Oakley beat analysts'
expectations, even though the expectations were lowered.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, Oakley said it still expects earnings of
about 10 cents a share on sales of $108 million to $110 million. If
it meets those expectations, the Foothill Ranch-based company said
earnings for the year would be 68 cents a share, compared with 72
cents a share in 2001, which included a tax-rate benefit of 6 cents a
share. Sales for the full year would rise about 16%.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, Oakley said it expects first-quarter earnings of 8 cents
a share, equal to this year's first quarter, and sales growth of 10%.
For the remainder of that year, the company said it expects sales and
earnings to both grow at a rate of about 17%. For all of 2003, the
company anticipates earnings growth of 13% on a 15% increase in
sales.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. cut profit forecasts after competition from cheaper,
generic versions of its antidepressant Prozac pushed sales lower in
the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Full-year profit, excluding one-time items, probably will be $2.55
to $2.57 a share, Lilly said. The company has lowered 2002 forecasts
three times in six months and is "cautious" about 2003 as regulators
reassess plants that failed inspections, stalling drug approvals.</LD>
<LD>   Net income jumped 20% to $683.9 million, or 63 cents a share, from
$570.1 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier, when write downs and
expenses hurt Lilly's profit. Third-quarter sales declined 3% to $2.8
billion. Excluding Prozac, revenue would have climbed 7%, the company
said.</LD>

<LD>Xerox Corp. rebounded to a quarterly profit as it cut 1,600 jobs to
help make up for a 10th straight quarter of falling sales.</LD>
<LD>   Third-quarter net income was $105 million, or 5 cents a share,
contrasted with a net loss of $32 million, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 6% to $3.79 billion, the Stamford, Conn.-based
company said.</LD>

drop came from leaving the retail business for small- and home-office

charges in the $692.1-million trading scandal that rocked Allied

Rusnak's attorney declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   * Hanover Compressor Co., the U.S. pipeline equipment maker that

<LD>The White House sought to allay concerns about an unusual attack this
week against the 13 computer servers that manage global Internet
traffic, stressing that disruption was minimal and the FBI is working
to trace the attackers.</LD>
<LD>   The attack lasted an hour and it was unclear where it originated,
who might be responsible or whether the attack could be considered
cyber-terrorism. The FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center
and agents from its cyber-crime division were investigating.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines said it refiled its application with the government
for a $1.8-billion loan guarantee after wringing more concessions
from its labor unions.</LD>
<LD>   United, a unit of UAL Corp., hopes that its target of $5.8 billion
in wage and other concessions over 5 1/2 years, as well as other
austerity measures, will be enough to sway the three-member Air
Transportation Stabilization Board.</LD>
<LD>   The board, which has not taken any formal action on United's
application, told the carrier its initial cost-saving measures were
insufficient for loan guarantee approval.</LD>

<HD>Skechers Profit Rises 24% Even as Sales Decline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skechers USA Inc. said Wednesday that third-quarter profit rose 24%,
despite slower sales, as the shoemaker con- tained costs and operated
more efficiently.</LD>
<LD>   Net earnings were $14.1 million, or 35 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $11.4 million, or 30 cents a
share, in the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Sales for the quarter slumped 9% to $261.1 million, compared with
$287.9 million in the comparable period in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Earnings beat the lowered expectations of a consensus of analysts
from Thomson First Call, who anticipated net income of 30 cents a
share. Analysts lowered their expectations from 41 cents a share
after a warning from Skechers last month.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers shares jumped 14% to close at $10.30, up $1.29, in New
York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have lost almost 30% of their
value this year.</TE>
<TE>   Citing sluggish consumer spending, labor issues at the West Coast
ports and volatile international events, the Manhattan Beach-based
company again reduced fourth-quarter earnings expectations, this time
to 3 cents to 8 cents a share. Analysts were expecting profit of 11
cents, having scaled back their earlier expectations of 26 cents a
share after Skechers' warning last month.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the quarter should be $195 million to $205 million,
compared with the previous estimate of $214 million.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers also said it now expects earnings per share for the full
year of between $1.42 and $1.47, compared with $1.24 last year.
Analysts were anticipating profit of $1.46 for 2002.</TE>

<HD>WellPoint Says Net Income Nearly Doubled</HD>
<DH>The health insurer's third-quarter revenue is up 39% as
enrollment and premiums climb. Overhead and selling costs are
reduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., one of the nation's largest health
insurers, said Wednesday that its third-quarter profit nearly doubled
from a year earlier, thanks to investment gains, enrollment growth
and lower administrative costs.</LD>
<LD>   The results from the Thousand Oaks-based parent of Blue Cross of
California exceeded expectations and reflected the financial strength
in the managed-care industry, which has kept ahead of surging health
costs with hefty premium increases.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, UnitedHealth Group Inc., the nation's largest
health insurer, reported a 53% jump in quarterly profit. And analysts
at Merrill Lynch have predicted that the industry overall will show
average earnings growth of 39% for the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts see an eventual easing in the growth rate, but various
reports suggest that insurers will see even bigger premium increases
from employers next year than this year's 13%. "They haven't been
getting significant resistance from employers," said Clifford Hewitt,
a health analyst at Legg Mason, a Baltimore brokerage firm.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint's profit for the latest quarter rose to $211.3 million,
or $1.38 a share, from $108.4 million, or 82 cents a share, a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The latest results included a pretax gain of $64.9 million from
the company's investment in Trigon Healthcare Inc., which was
acquired by Anthem Inc., a close rival of WellPoint that has been
vying to build a national network of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans. Excluding that gain and other special items, WellPoint earned
$1.17 a share, 4 cents ahead of analysts' consensus estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue rose 39% to $4.52 billion.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint said its nationwide enrollment jumped 27% from a year
ago, to 13.05 million at the end of September, largely because of
acquisitions in Missouri and Texas. But total membership was
essentially unchanged from the second quarter, despite good gains in
California.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint's medical loss ratio, or the cost of providing
health-care services divided by the premiums it collected, held
steady at 81.7%, one of the lowest in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, WellPoint said, it lowered its overhead and
selling costs, to 16.3% of revenue from 16.7% in the second quarter
and 17.5% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company released its earnings after markets closed Tuesday.
Its shares dropped $1.07 to $84.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock is up 45% since the start of the year.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Weigh SEC Boost in Funding</HD>
<DH>Officials say the agency's budget request may be increased
beyond 30% earlier deemed enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Wednesday that it would consider
boosting funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission beyond
the 30% increase that White House officials said last week was enough
for the agency.</LD>
<LD>   "We will work with the Congress to make sure [the SEC] has the
resources it needs," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC requested $568 million for the current fiscal year, a 30%
increase. Congress called for a 77% increase in a law that set up a
new board to review accounting standards after Enron Corp. and
WorldCom Inc. declared bankruptcy. Last year's SEC budget was $438
million.</LD>
<TE>   Final funding for the agency will be worked out when Congress
returns after the Nov. 5 elections.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said President Bush's refusal to support the full
$776-million congressional budget request for the SEC is an example
of Republican foot-dragging on corporate accountability issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly condemn the Bush administration's decisions not to
adequately fund the Securities and Exchange Commission, a decision
that significantly undermines the recently enacted corporate reform
law," House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and other
Democrats said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is operating under last year's budget until Congress
passes the spending legislation that includes a new budget for the
agency. Neither the House nor the Senate has approved a bill
including a new SEC budget.</TE>

<TE>   N.Y. Prosecutors to Question Citigroup Chief</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Sanford I. Weill will
meet with investigators from New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer's
office as part of the investigation into Citigroup research
practices, a Spitzer aide said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sandy Weill has offered to meet with our office, and we've
accepted his offer of cooperation," said Spitzer spokeswoman Juanita
Scarlett.</TE>
<TE>   She said Weill is not a target of the investigation at this time
and a meeting hasn't been scheduled. Spitzer will consider all
evidence he collects and won't rule out any action, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Scarlett emphasized the time frame after Weill released a
statement quoting his legal advisor, Marty Lipton, as saying "any
charge against Sandy Weill is inconceivable."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office has told Citigroup attorneys that the company's
interests may have diverged from those of Weill, according to the
Wall Street Journal, which reported the probe Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Weill issued a memo to Citigroup's senior managers Wednesday,
rebutting the notion that his interests and those of the company had
diverged.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board has been kept fully informed as the investigations have
progressed and is fully supportive of my decision to testify," Weill
stated.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what new information investigators have found, the
Journal said, except that it falls under Weill's actions regarding
Salomon Smith Barney's rating of AT&amp;T Corp., where he is a board
member. Salomon is Citigroup's brokerage unit.</TE>
<TE>   Weill said Wednesday that he never told any analysts what they
should write. "My conduct has been entirely appropriate and proper,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Weill announced his resignation from AT&amp;T's
board and said he won't stand for reelection to the board of United
Technologies Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office is investigating what role Weill had in Salomon's
AT&amp;T rating, including an upgrade made by telecom analyst Jack
Grubman right before the firm was planning a massive stock sale to
finance its wireless unit. AT&amp;T Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong
is a longtime Citigroup board member.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's stock closed Wednesday at $35.49, down 4 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instinet's Island Subpoenaed by SEC</TE>
<TE>   Island ECN Inc., the electronic trading network acquired by rival
Instinet Group Inc., has been subpoenaed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as part of an examination into the prices the
networks charge.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is seeking information on the different fees Island
charges subscribers and non-subscribers to trade with stock orders
posted on the network, New York-based Instinet said in an SEC filing.
Instinet is owned by Reuters Group.</TE>
<TE>   In another subpoena, the SEC is seeking information on trading and
market rebates in a probe of customer trading practices in
exchange-traded funds, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas come as the SEC is planning public hearings over the
next four weeks on issues in U.S. equity markets. The SEC will hear
testimony on inconsistent links between markets as well as different
regulatory obligations and fee requirements between exchanges and
electronic trading networks, known as ECNs.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the SEC and Island declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet shares fell 6 cents Wednesday to $2.90 and Reuters lost
58 cents to $16.55 in, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Crisis Is a Threat to Health</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Gordon</AU>
<BD>Suzanne Gordon writes about health care and nursing.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who has watched a hospitalized child, parent or friend pound
uselessly on a call button understands the problem: As nurses have to
care for more and sicker people, the death and accident rate among
patients goes up.</LD>
<LD>   For years, however, as nurses complained about the harm to
patients from staff cuts, hospital managers and executives dismissed
such worries as "anecdotal" or as disguised complaints about
increased workloads.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, research has proved the nurses resoundingly correct.</LD>
<TE>   In this week's Journal of the American Medical Assn., prominent
nursing and medical researchers confirm the risks to patients of
overburdening nurses.</TE>
<TE>   This study of more than 200,000 surgical patients and 10,000
nurses documents the link between nurse staffing and increased risk
of patients dying after surgery, as well as with increased nurse
burnout and job dissatisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   The report also proposes serious solutions modeled on a
safe-staffing law passed in California in 1999. (The law is not
scheduled to go into effect until January 2004, in part because of
heavy pressure for delay from hospitals.)</TE>
<TE>   Stopping the epidemic of deaths and injuries to hospitalized
patients and resolving the nursing shortage are now spoken of as
national priorities, but most of the political solutions being
proposed ignore the underlying problems laid bare by this and other
recent studies.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators for the latest study found that when nurse caseloads
exceeded four patients, the risk of a patient's dying increases by
about 7% per extra patient. If one nurse is caring for eight
patients, the patients are 31% more likely to die.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, each extra patient added to the nurses' caseloads increases
job dissatisfaction and the likelihood that burnout will push them
out of nursing altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Another recent study found that fewer nurses meant that patients
suffered from more urinary tract infections, falls and bedsores and
contracted pneumonia more often.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health
Care Organizations found that inadequate nurse staffing levels
contributed to nearly a quarter of the 1,609 cases of accidental
injury or death documented for hospitalized patients since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Even faced with such alarming numbers, legislators in most states
and in Congress have refused to pass tough staffing regulations or
limit hospital requirements that nurses work overtime to make up for
staff shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   With great fanfare, Congress instead passed the Nurse Reinvestment
Act.</TE>
<TE>   This act will, among other things, provide money for scholarships
to try to entice more people into nursing and give hospitals
resources to recruit new nurses. Many states are taking similar
action.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the measure, yet to be funded, and its state
clones do not deal seriously with hospital working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   By focusing on the production of a new crop of nurses, they merely
install another revolving door in hospitals that nurses are trying to
flee.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals argue that safe-staffing laws like California's and bans
on mandatory overtime won't work because, try as they might, they
just can't find enough nurses to fill their units. But making
hospitals friendly to nurses is the only way to make nursing a
satisfying career.</TE>
<TE>   When hospitals stop treating nurses as cheap, disposable labor --
and in the process exposing patients to unnecessary risks -- then
recruitment will pay off.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it this way: When a patient is hemorrhaging, the first
thing the medics do is find the source of the bleeding and try to
stem the flow. Then they give the patient a transfusion. If a
transfusion is given while a patient continues to hemorrhage, the
person's color may improve, and doctors and nurses may feel they've
"done something," but the patient will still bleed to death.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Beckons NATO</HD>
<DH>Alliance can prove its relevance with Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert E. Hunter</AU>
<BD>Robert E. Hunter, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO from
1993 to 1998, is a senior advisor at Rand.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What role for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Iraq
crisis and beyond? This question takes on special importance because
of continuing doubts about the future of the alliance, U.S.
skepticism about NATO allies' military competence and the conduct so
far of the war on terrorism. How it is answered will be critical in
determining whether NATO will have a future at all.</LD>
<LD>   On Sept. 12, 2001, of its own accord, NATO's governing body
invoked a provision in its charter that said if any member state was
attacked, each of the others would take, "individually and with the
other parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use
of armed force."</LD>
<LD>   This was an important and unprecedented step. The initiative came
from NATO's headquarters, out of solidarity with the U.S. but also to
avoid being shunted aside at such a critical juncture. But U.S.
leaders, leery of a "war by committee," which some believed had
slowed the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, declined a direct NATO role.</LD>
<TE>   Allies did eventually take part in the war in Afghanistan, and
several NATO nations have played some part in the overall effort to
counter global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But what about Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Bush administration secures broad allied support for
either effective inspections or direct military action against Saddam
Hussein's regime, an alliancewide role for NATO can be ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   Just as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the United States prefers to
base both command and force structure on its own resources, and few
allies have the modern combat equipment that would be required.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the limited military capabilities of virtually all NATO
allies but Britain have been at the heart of debate about NATO's
continued relevance. These limitations intrude even without
considering the misgivings of some allies -- notably Germany -- about
making war on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But NATO will be involved, if only indirectly, simply because of
the 53-year history of militaries working together, speaking the same
language (English), following the same basic doctrines and developing
habits of mind and action that have made Allied Command Europe the
most effective joint command in history.</TE>
<TE>   The test will come after the Iraq crisis is resolved, through
inspections or by war. The aftermath must be ongoing Western
engagement in the Middle East, including military power, far beyond
anything so far conceived.</TE>
<TE>   It is not in Washington's interest to do this alone: Countries in
the region would not want the U.S. to be so visible, and Americans
surely would want direct and tangible support from allies.</TE>
<TE>   Some of this would need to come in the form of rebuilding and
reform, now in Afghanistan, later, possibly, in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   That is a task where forging a close U.S. strategic partnership
with the European Union can be critical. But there also will be
shared military responsibilities, including peacekeeping forces
needed as a backdrop to political, economic and social change; to
play a constabulary role; to combat terrorism; or to help democratize
militaries, as NATO's Partnership for Peace has done so effectively
in the former Soviet empire.</TE>
<TE>   Doing all this would show that NATO could meet the realities of
21st century security.</TE>
<TE>   NATO should also look further ahead. At some point, Israelis and
Palestinians will make peace, but it will be an uneasy peace. Outside
military forces will be needed in the region to build confidence.
That necessarily means U.S. forces, and this was understood as long
ago as the Carter administration.</TE>
<TE>   It can -- and should -- also mean NATO. The alliance should start
planning for this eventuality now, which would help inspire
confidence among Israelis and Palestinians that they will not be left
to fend for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In wrapping up the strategic challenges of the 20th century, NATO
still has a European vocation. For the 21st century, its vocation is
in the Middle East, where it must prove its continued worth.</TE>

<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texan president had made a major commitment to war against one
country when the news came that a different country posed an even
greater threat to the United States. And so what did he do about the
new, more serious threat? Nothing. Why? Because he was totally
committed to dealing with the first threat.</LD>
<LD>   Does this scenario sound a bit like George W. Bush's talking war
against Iraq while talking peace toward nuclear North Korea? Maybe,
but we've seen this show before.</LD>
<LD>   It was also the scenario of Lyndon B. Johnson when he was
confronted with the news that North Korea had attacked and seized an
American Navy ship on the high seas Jan. 23, 1968. That was the
Pueblo, a lightly armed reconnaissance vessel. One sailor was killed
in the attack; the 82 surviving crew members were carried off to
North Korean dungeons.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson was angry, of course, but he was deeply committed to war
elsewhere, in Vietnam. Indeed, just a week after the seizure of the
Pueblo, the North Vietnamese launched their Tet offensive in South
Vietnam. In 1968, Americans killed in action totaled 14,589.</TE>
<TE>   And so the fate of the men of the Pueblo was reduced to a
sideshow. They were held in deprivation for 11 months -- some were
tortured -- until finally being released Dec. 23, 1968. To secure
their freedom, the American negotiator, Maj. Gen. Gilbert Woodward,
signed a letter of apology to the North Koreans. That was humiliating
enough, but then the situation worsened.</TE>
<TE>   On April 15, 1969, a Navy EC-121 reconnaissance plane was shot
down by North Korea in international airspace; 31 Americans died.
Once again the U.S., now led by President Richard Nixon, did nothing.
But, of course, Washington had few options.</TE>
<TE>   In an article headlined "A New Lesson in the Limits of Power,"
Time reported in its April 25, 1969, issue: "As with the Pueblo
incident 15 months ago, the U.S. found its alternatives severely
limited. Because Viet Nam has first claim on U.S. resources in the
Far East, and because more than 500,000 U.S. troops are still
committed there, the U.S. could hardly open a second front in Asia
without massive mobilization, which no one wants." In 1969, 9,314
Americans were killed in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam War faded away in the 1970s; Washington and Hanoi
normalized relations in 1995. Yet North Korea has never stopped being
an evil empire.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, a U.S. Army detachment clearing brush inside the
demilitarized zone between North and South Korea was attacked by
North Koreans. Two Americans were killed. In fact, an additional 64
American service personnel have died in North Korea-related incidents
since the armistice ending the Korean War was signed in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   And now North Korea has admitted -- perhaps "bragged" is a better
word -- that it has been developing nuclear weapons all along,
despite a 1994 agreement to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld says the North Koreans
probably have "one or two" A-bombs. Moreover, North Korea claims to
have "more powerful things" as well, presumably chemical and/or
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   So what's been Bush's reaction to this latest outrage from North
Korea? Like Johnson before him, he's had little to say about bad news
from the Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The commander in chief, who prides himself on his "moral clarity"
toward evil, said meekly this week, "I believe we can deal with this
threat peacefully." Such soft words seem all the more strange after
Bush named North Korea as part of the "axis of evil" in his January
State of the Union address.</TE>
<TE>   So what gives? Just as Johnson couldn't afford to be distracted
from war in Vietnam by an attack from North Korea, so Bush apparently
won't let a threat from the same country -- a threat that shadows the
37,000 American soldiers stationed in South Korea -- get in the way
of the war he is threatening against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush's national security priorities seem odd, they should at
least seem familiar. Four decades ago, a Texan gambled his presidency
on one all-consuming war. Johnson lost, of course, as did the nation.
And now it's George W. Bush's turn to stack all his chips on a single
enemy, even as other, greater dangers proliferate.</TE>

<HD>Prejudice and Politics Mix in Slurs on Israel</HD>

Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month, Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers aired his concern
about the rise of anti-Semitism and its apologists on campus.
Pro-Palestinian groups and their sympathizers howled in protest,
maintaining that criticism of Israeli policy does not automatically
constitute anti-Semitism.</LD>
<LD>   They were right. But they also were being more than a little
disingenuous because they know very well that free-floating criticism
of the Ariel Sharon government wasn't what Summers was decrying.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, a definition of terms is in order. After all, the
phenomenon of anti-Semitism as paranoia, to which Palestinian
advocates refer, is very real. It's true that some Jews, like some
gays, some blacks and some Latinos, have at times been too quick to
bigotize, as it were, anyone who criticizes them.</LD>
<TE>   Summers, however, is no such knee-jerk critic. Neither are others
among those who have expressed concern over rising anti-Semitism on
campus. It is real.</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Chicago, according to the Middle East Forum's
Campus Watch, a Jewish student walking at night on campus was
verbally assaulted when a car drove up beside him and a passenger
screamed: "Death to Jews, Hitler should have finished you all off
when he had the chance."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco State University, in addition to physically
threatening a Jewish studies professor and her students at a
pro-Israel march, a group of anti-Israel students shouted phrases
like "Die, you racist pigs" and "Hitler should have finished the
job."</TE>
<TE>   These were not criticisms of Israel or Israeli policies. These
were incontrovertible acts of anti-Semitism, and they are not the
only ones. They must be categorically distinguished from the kind of
uninformed, inflammatory and unscholarly -- but not necessarily
anti-Semitic -- things that are being said and taught.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, Douglas Card, who teaches a University of
Oregon course called "Social Inequality." Campus Watch reports that
Card called Israel a "terrorist state" and Israelis "baby-killers."</TE>
<TE>   This is bias, misinformation and jaundiced demagoguery of the type
found all too often on our leftist-dominated campuses. It's also
anti-Israeli, in the same way that calling the U.S. a terrorist state
is anti-American. But it isn't anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   It's no different in kind from a whole host of other hysterical
opinions that flow from leftist political prejudices and "correct"
ideas -- including Marxism, pacifism, multiculturalism and
postmodernism -- that worm their way into every aspect of campus
life.</TE>
<TE>   The distinction must hold, then, between anti-Semitism and
anti-Israeliism. The former is racism and is sometimes characterized
by hate crimes. The latter is opinion and is often characterized by
mindless hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   But what then of the divestment campaign, in which groups are
pressuring universities to sell their holdings in companies that do
business with Israel? Is this anti-Semitism?</TE>
<TE>   It depends. Some advocate divestment because they object to
Israeli policy, saying that Palestinians are being treated as blacks
were in apartheid South Africa. This is an erroneous comparison
because blacks in South Africa were not in the habit of sending
suicide bombers into Johannesburg. But it is not anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   Others favor divestment because they believe that Zionism is
inherently fascistic and illegitimate, because they object on
principle to a Jewish homeland and because they see divestment as a
means of bringing about the destruction of the Jewish state. This, by
definition, is anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   Baldfaced anti-Semitism is real and growing on our nation's
campuses, as is anti-Israeliism. Both need redressing. But failing to
make a distinction between the two plays directly into the hands of
the most cynical extremists on both sides, who would like nothing
better than to turn their critics into paranoid straw men.</TE>

<HD>Easier Absentee Voting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Voting by mail is easier than ever in California. In the past, you
had to be sick, disabled or out of town to get an absentee ballot.
Now, any registered voter can cast an absentee ballot.</LD>
<LD>   But there still are deadlines, and the one for applying for an
absentee ballot is the close of business Oct. 29 -- next Tuesday. The
application must be in the hands of county voting officials by then;
postmarks don't count. Ballots are mailed to voters after
applications are approved.</LD>
<LD>   The most common way to apply for an absentee ballot is to fill out
the form on the back cover of the sample official ballot that all
registered voters should have received in the mail by now. Otherwise,
a prospective voter can call the local registrar of voters office to
request a form or obtain one via the Internet by going to the
secretary of state's Web site, www.elections@ss.ca.gov. This site
provides addresses and telephone numbers for voting officials in all
58 counties and a direct computer link to each.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County registrar's Web site provides absentee
voting information and a link to a ballot application form. A
completed, signed application may be mailed to the registrar's office
or sent by fax. In Los Angeles County the fax numbers are (562)
462-2354 and (562) 462-3035; for information, (562) 466-1312 and
(800) 481-8683.</TE>
<TE>   One also can sign up as a permanent absentee voter by checking a
box on the absentee ballot application form; absentee ballots
automatically will be sent so long as he or she votes in every
election.</TE>
<TE>   The mailed ballot must reach the registrar's office before the
close of the polls at 8 p.m. on election day, Nov. 5. Or, it can be
turned in at any polling place in the county before 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   One potential problem: hanging chads. Absentee ballots are the
punch-card type that requires a little block to be punched out with a
pointed object. The voter must be sure to brush or pick off the chads
so the machine will read the ballot properly.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise a precious right. There's no excuse not to vote.</TE>

<HD>Ending a Dangerous Ritual</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bogaletch Gebre, a tall, soft-spoken woman in her late 40s, runs the
Kembatta Women's Center, a collective in her native Ethiopia
dedicated to ending the ancient practice of excising girls' external
genitalia.</LD>
<LD>   The World Health Organization says at least 130 million females
alive today have been subjected to this painful, ultimately numbing
practice. Usually this is done in a ceremony that many people in
Ethiopia, Egypt, Guinea and other African nations view as a form of
purification. In many regions, marriage is taboo if a girl is
"uncut."</LD>
<LD>   Gebre is trying to educate Americans about the practice, inflicted
on 2 million girls a year. But the former Fulbright scholar and
teacher, who endured the ritual as a girl without anesthetic,
emphasizes that neither well-meaning foreigners nor a nation's own
government can make the issue go away.</LD>
<TE>   Gebre's center, along with other nongovernmental groups guided by
the WHO, try to combat the problem directly by showing villagers
graphic videos of the bloody practice and by training teams of
villagers to conduct community outreach campaigns on public health
dangers (gravest among them: the instruments used to perform the
practice often spread HIV).</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find solutions within our own culture," Gebre says.
"If you are going to take away this sacred part of their life, then
you have to give them something in return."</TE>
<TE>   Gebre, who learned to read by campfire after she finished her
daily chores, emphasizes that the most effective way to eliminate
female genital excision is to give African girls options they don't
have today. For instance, the center is pushing for the construction
of reservoirs and bridges in Ethiopia. Hauling water, Gebre explains,
is the most time-consuming responsibility for girls and women in her
country. The longer they must travel to get it, the less time they
have for school. And the less education they have, the more likely
they are to yield to this dangerous tradition.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence that the approach works. Last month, more than
2,000 people in an Ethiopian community called Hobich-Haka (Forest of
the Lions) attended the area's first wedding in which an uncut girl
was publicly married. Ethiopian television broadcast the ceremony in
the region's Amharic and Oromo dialects. "Everybody," Gebre says, "is
still talking about the courageous young couple."</TE>
<TE>   Westerners can best help Africa find its own path away from
mutilation rituals by supporting projects with a holistic approach to
women's well-being and encouraging the U.S. government to do the
same. Citing an Ethiopian proverb, Gebre says: "When threads unite,
you can tie down a lion."</TE>
<TE>   To Take Action: Contact the center through Parents International
Ethiopia at (213) 833-6314.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Home schoolers, rest assured: The state Education Department is
looking to fix your problem, despite the lack of evidence that you
have one. The department recently created a statewide furor with its
memo saying that unless parents had a teaching credential or were
affiliated with a public school, they were "outside the law" in
teaching their kids at home.</LD>
<LD>   The department ostensibly is acting to save children from inept
parent teachers. It doesn't know of any troubled home schools, you
understand. But even if it did, there are better ways to go about
this.</LD>
<LD>   Home schooling is spreading beyond the hippies who revived the
age-old tradition, and the religious fundamentalists who
repopularized it, to moms and dads who are simply unhappy with public
schools and cannot afford or don't want a private school.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps they move every couple of years; teaching at home provides
continuity. They might have bright, creative children who were bored
by the plodding pace at public schools, which focus more on bringing
up the underachievers than on challenging the gifted. Their offspring
might be social outcasts in the conformist world of campus cliques.
Whatever the reasons, a 1999 report by the National Center for
Education Statistics estimated the number of home-schooled children
at 850,000.</TE>
<TE>   What's the California Education Department's problem with this?
Officials say they're simply reminding people about the
compulsory-education law: From ages 6 to 18, children must get a
public education unless they attend private school or have a
credentialed tutor -- thus the credential requirement for parents.
The natural reaction to this demand is a snigger. Isn't this the
state where one in seven public school teachers lacks a full
credential?</TE>
<TE>   For decades, home schoolers in California have registered as
private schools, which don't need credentialed teachers, can have any
number of students and can teach by almost any method. The Education
Department does nothing to stop the home schools but insists they're
illegal. Its argument: There's no law specifically allowing a home
school to be considered a private school. True enough. There's also
no law forbidding it.</TE>
<TE>   The edict comes off as harsh and arbitrary. Officials admit they
have no reason to think parents do a worse job of teaching than the
many nine- or 12-student private schools across the state. They
probably do better in many cases, given that parents, as a rule, care
more about their own children than do the most caring strangers.</TE>
<TE>   State schools chief Delaine Eastin decries their lack of
supervision. But home schoolers seek out more help than ever before.
In addition to the 85,000 who affiliate with public or charter
schools, thousands more attend national conferences, join support
groups and consult the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The state is right about one thing: Though home-school wunderkind
stories abound, the public is less likely to hear about the child who
sits home watching "Springer." Home schooling is sorely in need of
objective, scholarly study.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania takes care of the compulsory-education issue by
requiring occasional testing for home-schooled children and annual
portfolios of their work. Texas, on the other hand, lets such schools
operate with virtually no oversight. A middle way might work for
California. Parents could file a portfolio or an education plan with
an independent commission. That makes more sense than turning them
into outlaws.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Cancer in the Body Politic: 41 Million Uninsured Americans,"
Washington Outlook, Oct. 21: Let's get something straight. Any
American without health insurance is an American who has chosen that
condition. I'm 55, lost my job and employer-provided insurance in
early 2001 and subsequently replaced it with a $178-a-month plan from
a private insurer. At no cost, www.ehealthinsurance.com will supply
dozens of quotes from a variety of sources. Today I priced plans for
a family of four: a male, age 32; a female, age 30; with two
children, ages 8 and 6. Premiums ranged from $99 to $191 (and higher
depending on deductibles, coverages). So it's a matter of individuals
making choices and setting priorities.</LD>
<LD>   Not once does Ronald Brownstein mention private alternatives to
government-fiat plans. There may be 41 million uninsured Americans,
but each of them can find some kind of coverage at reasonable cost
with a little effort and by making sacrifices between luxuries and
necessities. The nanny state does not have to be the solution.</LD>

<TE>   So little is written on this shame that we as a society are
fiddling as our health system goes up in flames. This simmering
disaster will affect not only the poor but all of us in this, the
richest, most powerful nation on Earth. A consequence here in
Southern California is the threat to close Harbor General Hospital, a
major public institution that provides the only trauma center for the
Greater South Bay as well as needed psychiatric, general medical and
specialty care to vast numbers of the uninsured. To add insult to
injury, this chronic, "untreated" problem was greatly accentuated by
the theft of California's surplus funds by the Texas energy cabal.
Why aren't we talking about this in the media and other public forums
before it really is too late?</TE>

<LD>I was appalled to read that the younger, more conservative priests
are more likely to regard the use of condoms to prevent AIDS as a sin
("Young Priests Hold Old Values," Oct. 21). A sizable portion of
those who get AIDS from unprotected sex are the babies who are born
as a result of not using protection. Apparently these priests think
it's preferable for babies to be born with AIDS than for people to
disobey church regulations. It sounds like the Catholic Church's
headlong rush back to the Middle Ages under John Paul II is
accelerating.</LD>

<LD>Re "This Is Oil -- This Is a No-Brainer on Oil," by Arianna
Huffington, Commentary, Oct. 22: Waiting for the American public to
get religion on energy conservation would be like waiting for
President Bush to concede defeat in the 2000 election. Our most
effective weapon against Saddam Hussein and Middle Eastern terrorist
organizations would be to reduce oil consumption by driving smaller
cars, carpooling, walking and riding bikes. The U.S. could go to war
without risking a single soldier's life.</LD>
<LD>   But Americans have somehow come to believe that driving the
vehicle of their choice in the manner they see fit is the highest
form of liberty and freedom. They will gladly give up civil or
privacy rights as long as they can drive their SUVs, alone, at 75
mph.</LD>

has declared amnesty and generously sent jubilant prisoners --
dangerous, petty, innocent, guilty and political -- out of his jails
into the arms of loved ones and before the cameras of awaiting press

<TE>   Do we ignore the laws of cause and effect and just cheer the
consequences, or must we hold our noses and credit the tough talk of
George ll? I forget ... does the end ever justify the means? It's too
complicated. Let's pack a lunch, cheer the goodwill of the
Palestinian people, jeer the "Neighborhood Bully" (as Bob Dylan
ironically titled a song about Israel) and march arm in arm for
peace.</TE>

<TE>   I was very amused by the Sean Kelly cartoon in the Oct. 20 Opinion
section. Uncle Sam cannot use his megaphone to speak to our European
allies because the wall plug does not fit. In the accompanying
article, "Winning Hearts and Minds of the Europeans," Seth Gitell is
only partially right when he wishes we still had the CIA-financed
Congress for Cultural Freedom to give our side of the issues. The
problem is not just the substance but the way our government often
speaks to our friends.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think we were about to aim those precision-guided bombs at
Paris or Berlin whenever our allies voice the slightest doubt about
the wisdom of our foreign policies in the world. There is no need to
beat them about the head with our superior power. True power does not
need to advertise: Everybody knows if you have it. International
leadership calls for gentle persuasion, not muscular posturing. We
need more Secretary of State Colin Powell and less Vice President
Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.</TE>

<LD>Re "Troubled Home for Children May Close," Oct. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Instead of replacing Los Angeles County's MacLaren Children's
Center in El Monte with a facility of a lower level of care (e.g., a
group home) it should be upgraded and specialized into an
intermediate-level-of-care facility, specifically for abused and
neglected children who suffer from psychological and psychiatric
illness.</LD>
<LD>   The length of stay should average one month, with placement in the
community as the goal. This would avoid having these children stay in
acute psychiatric hospitals (average length of stay, one week) for
extra days or weeks while placements are made from the acute
hospital.</LD>
<TE>   How is this different from the way the MacLaren Center runs now?
Only in the added funding, commitment and mission of specifically
serving children with psychiatric illness, as opposed to being a
shelter with minimal psychological support for these children.</TE>
<TE>   A group home, while a needed resource, would not offer a needed
transition from placement or hospital to another placement. There is
a dearth of acute and sub-acute psychiatric services for children as
it is.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 52: Same-Day Voter Registration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a former election clerk, I must take strong exception to your "no"
recommendation to Proposition 52 (editorial, Oct. 20). I am firmly in
favor of same-day registration, and I know the process will be
protected from voter fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The same arguments were used against "provisional ballots." It is
in fact a more stringent process currently to re-register at a new
residence on election day than to register before the 30-day
deadline. Both a valid photo ID and a proof of residence (utility
bill, credit card bill, not junk mail) must be shown to the clerk
before the voter gets a ballot. This same standard would be applied
to new voters registering and voting on election day.</LD>
<LD>   It was my job to verify "provisional ballot" ID data before the
voter got a ballot, and it was my job to enter the data on the
provisional ballot envelope (in effect a re-registering-to-vote
form). Once the voter had cast a ballot, it was placed inside the
envelope and sealed. These envelopes would not be opened (and the
ballots would not be counted) unless the information on the envelope
forms could be verified by the registrar.</LD>
<TE>   I have confidence in the Orange County registrar's office
personnel to know how to do their job.</TE>
<TE>   David G. Porter</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In her Oct. 18 commentary, the former Minnesota secretary of
state, Joan Anderson Growe, advocates election day voter
registration, citing her experience in her state. She says voter
fraud has not increased. But she really means that there was no more
fraud detected. Moreover, she does not differentiate between
demographics in Minnesota and California. We have a much larger
number of people who already have demonstrated their disdain for our
laws.</TE>
<TE>   I take exception to the current trend toward increasing turnout by
making the process less demanding. Somebody said that an "informed
electorate" is necessary for democracy to function and thrive. I
believe that an uninformed electorate threatens our democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are not motivated to pre-register are unlikely to make
the effort to acquaint themselves with the candidates or issues.
Their votes are easily influenced by so-called leaders, who exploit
their "leadership" as a "power base," the ability to deliver votes.</TE>

<LD>Re "Teens' Rite of Passage Can Include Their Faith," Oct. 19: Your
highlight of a quote by Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney that,
with the current state of indifference among teenage boys to
declaring Jesus their "personal savior" (whatever that means), the
U.S. will become a "heathen nation," makes me think you have taken a
page out of the Rev. Jerry Falwell "open mouth, insert foot"
handbook.</LD>
<LD>   Spirituality in the U.S. is not predicated on how many people
accept fundamentalist Christianity. There are plenty of Jews, Muslims
and Buddhists, not to mention those of us on a spiritual path who
don't care to join organized religion, who are fully capable of
preventing the U.S. from becoming a "heathen" nation. Instead of
highlighting this limited thinking, how about bringing us more from
religious or just plain spiritual teachers who can help us to model
tolerance for the rest of the world?</LD>

<HD>Dylan Ticket Seller Tangled Up in Blue</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Wednesday my wife and I, along with a friend, drove 60 miles to
see Bob Dylan in concert at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. My
friend's wife is undergoing chemotherapy treatments and her health
didn't allow her to use the fourth ticket. "No problem," I thought.</LD>
<LD>   At the venue I quickly walked about trying to sell her ticket for
less than face value. Upon showing one person the ticket and the
lesser price I was selling it for, she showed me her badge. I was
handcuffed, escorted by two officers to a police van, searched and
loaded into the van with three others.</LD>
<LD>   At the station I was finally uncuffed, searched again and had my
shoelaces taken away. Eventually I was booked, cited for a
misdemeanor, fingerprinted and posed for a mug shot. After three
hours I was released and told to return to face a judge in L.A. in
two weeks. I had to take a taxi back to the Wiltern to try to find my
panic-stricken wife, who had no idea where I was.</LD>
<TE>   Who am I? A 56-year-old teacher who has been teaching for over 30
years and has never been in any trouble of any kind. Are you as proud
of our police force as I am -- to have taken a "criminal" like me off
the streets while so much other chaos and terror reigns around the
world? What is the cost of the manpower to deal with such a trivial
incident as this? I remain in shock and furious.</TE>

<HD>Manfred Ewald, 76; Oversaw Doping of East Germany's Olympic
Athletes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Manfred Ewald, who as head of the state sports program in the former
East Germany oversaw one of the most despicable, large-scale doping
experiments ever conducted in the name of Olympic glory and national
pride, has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Ewald, a former Nazi who after World War II served the Communist
regime in East Germany at its highest levels, died Monday of
complications of pneumonia in his hometown, Damsdorf, southeast of
Berlin.</LD>
<LD>   From the early 1960s until the late 1980s, Ewald reigned as the
undisputed "sportfuhrer" of the East German sports machine,
overseeing athletes who won more than 500 Olympic medals. It wasn't
until after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that the truth, long
suspected by skeptics, was confirmed: The medals were won after
force-feeding performance-enhancing steroids to thousands of
athletes, some as young as 11.</LD>
<TE>   Many who took the "little blue pills," as they were called without
knowing what they really were, are now permanently disfigured. Others
suffered from health problems, including cancer, cysts and liver
ailments. Some gave birth to children with severe defects. One
champion shot-putter, Heidi Krieger, said the male characteristics
that developed after steroid use prompted a sex-change operation;
Heidi Krieger is now Andreas Krieger.</TE>
<TE>   "When you silently dope children, surreptitiously do that, it's
just hard to imagine in sport how it gets any worse than that," said
Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and expert on doping in
sports, in particular Olympic Games. "Clearly, he's one of those
people [who] qualifies in the category of the world being a better
place because of his passing rather than because he was here in the
first place."</TE>
<TE>   A series of prosecutions in reunified Germany charged a number of
East Germany's sports officials with crimes connected to the doping
program. In 2000, Ewald -- along with Manfred Hoppner, the doctor who
implemented the scheme -- was convicted in a Berlin court of "aiding
and abetting bodily harm." Both received suspended sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Hoppner offered an apology, as did virtually every official
connected with the program known by the official euphemism "Working
Group on Supporting Means" -- doublespeak for doping. Ewald never
apologized. When subpoenaed for trial, he declared, "Communists do
not murder people."</TE>
<TE>   Ewald was born May 17, 1926. His father was a tailor. In 1938, he
joined the Hitler Youth and, in 1944, he became a member of the Nazi
Party.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he joined the German Communist Party and, at age
27, he became a member of East German's central committee, serving as
sports minister until 1988. From 1973 until the country fell apart in
1990, Ewald also headed the East German Olympic Committee, developing
a country of only 17 million people into a sports power that
challenged the United States and the Soviet Union in the Olympic
Games from 1972 through 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he remarked to Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of
the International Olympic Committee, "It doesn't matter who has the
power, as long as I have the glory." Samaranch famously responded,
"The power is the glory."</TE>
<TE>   At the 1972 Munich Games, the East German team won 20 medals; in
Montreal in 1976, 40.</TE>
<TE>   East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming in 1976.
Author David Wallechinsky notes in "The Complete Book of the Summer
Olympics" that in 1976 15-year-old Petra Thumer's time in the
400-meter freestyle, 4:09.89, would have won her a silver medal in
the 1968 men's 400-meter race and a gold in 1964. In the 400-meter
individual medley, 18-year-old Ulrike Tauber smashed the world record
by 6.02 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   At those Montreal Games, U.S. swimmer Shirley Babashoff, who
finished second in three of the four freestyle races, was dismissed
by many as a sore loser for suggesting that the East Germans were
doping. Fourteen years later, she was proven right.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC has consistently declined to rewrite history -- to award
Babashoff, for instance, the gold medals she would have won if the
East Germans had not been cheating. In the aftermath of the judging
scandal at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, which resulted in
duplicate golds being awarded to the Canadian and Russian pairs
skaters, some have called for a renewed look at the results from
Games dominated by East Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Ungerleider, a sports psychologist whose 2001 book "Faust's
Gold" recounts the German doping trials, suggested Wednesday that the
IOC need not "rewrite history and give Shirley, for instance, her
medals."</TE>
<TE>   "But what [the IOC] does need to do is apologize -- apologize to
all the American ladies and all the others who got beaten up here,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether Samaranch knew the nature and extent of
the East German doping program. In the mid-1980s, in an effort to
keep East Germany from boycotting the 1988 Games in Seoul, he awarded
Ewald the Olympic Order, the highest honor in international sports.
Samaranch has long declined to answer questions on the matter,
telling The Times two years ago, "The past is the past."</TE>
<TE>   East Germany's past, however, has not escaped the attention of
other nations keen to exploit sporting success for political results.
A number of other countries do at least in part what Ewald and the
East Germans did: identify young athletes early, stash them in
special state schools away from parents and family, and monitor their
training and diet.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear how many athletes -- if any -- are being given
the modern equivalent of "little blue pills."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that's happening, of course, is that there are
some sports programs which are emulating the systematic approach of
the East German system," said John Hoberman, a University of Texas
professor who has studied the import of doping in the Olympic
movement.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, the idea that the right approach to elite sport
is to squeeze as much human material and as much performance out of
your population is an idea that's alive and well," Hoberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald is survived by his wife, Vera, and three children.</TE>

<HD>Richard Helms, 89; CIA Chief, Career Spy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Thurber</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former CIA Director Richard Helms, who ran afoul of Congress for
failing to fully disclose the agency's questionable activities at
home and abroad, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Helms, the first career intelligence officer to head the CIA, died
Tuesday night at his Washington, D.C.-area home, the agency announced
Wednesday. It did not report the cause of death, but Helms had been
in failing health for some time.</LD>
<LD>   Helms, who was present at the creation of the agency in 1947
during the Cold War, was an important operations man in the agency
for two decades. He was a firm believer in the importance of the
espionage game. To the lean, dapper and detached Helms that meant
maintaining the rules of the game -- silence and loyalty.</LD>
<TE>   "Espionage," he once remarked, "is not played by the Marquess of
Queensberry rules, and the only sin in espionage is getting caught."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," he said on another occasion, "the American people
want an effective, strong intelligence operation. They just don't
want to hear too much about it."</TE>
<TE>   When times changed and Congress demanded to know about CIA spying
on American citizens, or efforts to kill Cuba's Fidel Castro or to
overthrow the government of Socialist President Salvador Allende in
Chile, Helms felt no obligation to fully assist panels investigating
those matters. He worked for the president and answered only to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt obliged to keep some of this stuff ... in other words, not
volunteer a good deal of information," he told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he pleaded no contest to failing to testify fully
before the committee. He was given a suspended jail sentence and
fined $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Versed in Languages</TE>
<TE>   Helms was born in St. Davids, Pa., the son of an Alcoa executive
and grandson of a leading international banker. He grew up in South
Orange, N.J., and was schooled in Europe, where he became versed in
languages and fluent in French and German.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Williams College, where he was president of his class,
editor of the campus newspaper and graduated Phi Beta Kappa.</TE>
<TE>   With the goal of eventually owning a small newspaper, he set off
after graduation for a career in journalism. He went to London and
became a European correspondent for United Press. He covered the
Berlin Olympics in 1936 and interviewed a number of the leading
figures of the day, including skater Sonja Henie. A year later, he
was among a group of journalists who interviewed Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Helms returned to the United States in 1938 and took a job on the
business side at the Indianapolis Times. He rose quickly and became
national advertising director within a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days of World War II, Helms was commissioned in the
Navy with the rank of lieutenant. But within a year he was
transferred to the Office of Strategic Services, the intelligence
forerunner of the CIA, largely based on his keen knowledge of foreign
languages.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he held desk jobs in Washington and New York but later
served in Britain and the European theater. He was assigned to Berlin
at the end of the war and worked for Allen Dulles, who would later
become head of the CIA himself.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Helms stayed in intelligence work, giving up his
plans in the newspaper business. When the CIA was established, Helms
was one of the architects of the new organization.</TE>
<TE>   His role in those early years, authorities on the history of the
agency say, was running covert operations.</TE>
<TE>   Working through Berlin, he planned and executed successful
eavesdropping operations on the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Through most of the 1950s, he was a leading recruiter and trainer
of intelligence agents working in the Eastern Bloc. He also
reportedly had a hand in U.S. intelligence activities in Africa,
specifically the Congo, including a scheme to assassinate Patrice
Lumumba.</TE>
<TE>   Although passed over for promotion in the late 1950s, Helms
resurfaced in the early '60s when questions arose about intelligence
gathering in the wake of the Bay of Pigs debacle in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Helms, who consistently opposed that plan to oust Castro, was
named head of the plans division, the third highest position in the
agency. He was responsible for espionage, intelligence gathering,
special undercover operations and the political propaganda section.</TE>
<TE>   Passed Over</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, when Director John McCone resigned, Helms was his favored
successor, but President Johnson chose Vice Adm. William F. Raborn
instead. Helms became deputy director.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Raborn -- who had little experience in foreign
affairs or intelligence gathering -- resigned. Helms was named
director, a post he would hold for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Through much of his tenure, Helms -- with his solid background in
the agency during the Cold War -- was well-regarded by congressional
oversight panels and the news media. But during this time, the agency
was also conducting operations that would change public perceptions
of the role of intelligence gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Under Johnson and then President Nixon, Helms headed Operation
Chaos, which spied on American citizens linked to the increasingly
powerful antiwar movement, looking for ties to foreign governments.
Under this operation, the CIA amassed files on tens of thousands of
American citizens or groups.</TE>
<TE>   The agency later set up two additional programs to monitor
dissident groups.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials knew that these activities were in violation of the
agency's charter and, in a February 1969 letter to Henry Kissinger,
then national security advisor, Helms urged that Chaos reports be
kept top secret.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, the agency was further compromised when
several of its employees were arrested in the break-in at the
Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But although it later came to light that Helms destroyed documents
that may have been helpful to the investigation of Watergate, he
ignored Nixon's request to bring the CIA in to block the FBI probe of
the break-in.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to Resign</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Nixon forced him to resign as head of the CIA. Helms was
given the post of ambassador to Iran, which he held until 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, speculation has grown that Helms was the famous
source known as Deep Throat, who helped guide Washington Post
reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their Pulitzer
Prize-winning investigation of the Watergate scandal. But asked
Wednesday about the speculation, Woodward -- now an assistant
managing editor at the Post -- said Deep Throat wasn't Helms.</TE>
<TE>   In his biography, "The Man Who Kept the Secrets," Thomas Powers
wrote that Helms' "style was cool by choice and temperament; his
instinct was to soften differences, to find a middle ground, to tone
down operations that were getting out of hand, to give faltering
projects one more chance rather than shut them down altogether, to
settle for compromise in the interests of bureaucratic peace."</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1970s, Helms was repeatedly called to testify before
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about CIA activities that
may have violated the agency's charter. He was accused by the panel
of failing to notify senior administration officials of efforts to
assassinate Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Another Senate panel, the Foreign Relations Committee, found that
Helms had lied when he insisted the CIA had not tried to overthrow
Allende or offer financial support to the socialist leader's
political opponents. Allende was killed in 1973 when a right-wing
coup overthrew his government.</TE>
<TE>   Helms was convicted on only federal misdemeanor charges of
misleading Congress after the Justice Department, in a rare move,
sought a plea agreement to avoid a public trial in which top-secret
information might be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom on the day of his sentencing, Helms'
attorney, Edward Bennett Williams, said his client would "wear this
conviction like a badge of honor." To the end, Helms believed deeply
in the mission of the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "I believed in the importance to the nation of the function that
the agency served. I still do -- without regrets, without qualms,
without apology," he told the Rockefeller Commission, which in 1975
investigated allegations of unlawful CIA activities in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, attempts were made to restore Helms'
reputation. President Reagan awarded him the National Security Medal
in a White House ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Helms was also named to a panel to study counterintelligence
breaches and later a presidential review board on security problems
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Agents often turned to him in times of trouble, Powers wrote of
Helms.</TE>
<TE>   "During Iran-Contra, a lot of CIA people suddenly found themselves
on the wrong end of an investigation. Helms would call up those
people, invite them to dinner or lunch and he would more or less tell
them how you live through this, and believe me, they were grateful,"
Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   Helms' first marriage to Julia Bretzman Shields ended in divorce.
He later married Cynthia McKelvie, who survives him. He is also
survived by a son, Dennis, from his first marriage.</TE>
<TE>   He will be buried at Arlington National Ceremony on Nov. 20.</TE>

<HD>Harry Kitano, 76; UCLA Professor, Expert on Race Relations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry H.L. Kitano, a UCLA social scientist and leading authority on
race and ethnic relations, particularly Asian Americans' experiences,
has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Kitano died Saturday of a stroke at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in
West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   According to his wife, Lynn, Kitano had spent the morning working
on the sixth edition of his classic textbook, "Race Relations," in
his Santa Monica home.</LD>
<TE>   During Kitano's more than four decades at the university, he
served as co-director of UCLA's Alcohol Research Center and twice as
acting director of the Asian American Studies Center, the nation's
largest facility for such research. In 1990, he became the first
recipient of the endowed chair in Japanese American studies at UCLA,
the only academic chair of its kind in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He was a pioneer in community research studies of interracial
marriages, juvenile delinquency, mental health and alcohol abuse
among the rapidly growing, diverse Asian Pacific American population.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Don T. Nakanishi, director of the Asian
American Studies Center, said Kitano was committed to guiding sound
public policies on many compelling community issues that had long
been overlooked because of the misinformed notions that Asian
Americans were a model minority without social needs and concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Maki, acting dean of the College of Health and Human
Services at Cal State Los Angeles, and one of Kitano's many former
students, said Kitano's work was instrumental in Asian Americans
embracing their identity.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very adept at being able to describe how things once were,
how things are now, and most important, how things could be," said
Maki. "It was that vision of how things could be -- his vision of a
fair, democratic, multicultural society -- that was so inspirational
to many of us."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars said Kitano's first book, "Japanese Americans: The
Emergence of a Subculture," was the first in-depth, sociological
analysis of the Japanese American experience. Its publication in 1969
catapulted him to celebrity status in both the academic and public
arenas, and he became a sought-after speaker.</TE>
<TE>   His last book, "Achieving the Impossible Dream: How Japanese
Americans Achieved Redress," which he wrote with Maki and S. Megan
Berthold, analyzed how key elected officials and community
organizations went about achieving redress and a national apology for
the 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were confined during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   A native of San Francisco, Kitano grew up in San Francisco's
Chinatown, where his immigrant parents ran a hotel. After the bombing
of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he and his family were ordered to
leave their home. They first were sent to the Santa Anita racetrack
in Arcadia, where they lived in a horse stall for six months, then to
the Topaz internment camp in Utah, where they remained from 1942 to
1945.</TE>
<TE>   When he was released from Topaz, Kitano did not return to the West
Coast, fearing lingering racial hostility. He changed his name to
Harry Lee and traveled to Milwaukee, where he worked briefly as a
farmhand. Moving to Minnesota, he played trombone with several jazz
bands, where he had worked with African American musicians. He
returned to the Bay Area in 1946 and, though he hadn't been able to
finish high school because he was interned, attended UC Berkeley,
where he earned degrees in sociology and social work and a PhD in
education and psychology.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success in academe, music remained his passion. His
taste ran from jazz to classical to Michael Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   An incurable romantic, Kitano watched the movie "Dr. Zhivago" a
dozen times, and "cried every time," said his wife Lynn Kitano.</TE>
<TE>   On May 6, 1997, Kitano was the keynote speaker at a special
ceremony to award high school diplomas to Japanese Americans who were
pulled out of school because of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "I do things backward," Kitano told the gathering. "I got a PhD
first and then I got my high school diploma."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Kitano is survived by five children,
Keith, of Tokyo; Kimberly and Kerrily, both of San Francisco; Kraig,
of Los Angeles; and Christine, of Santa Monica; and one grandson.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial will be held Dec. 14 at 10:30 a.m. at the UCLA
Faculty Center. Donations can be made to the Harry Kitano Scholarship
Endowment/UCLA Foundation, c/o UCLA Asian American Studies Center,
P.O. Box 951546, 3230 Campbell Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1546.</TE>

<HD>Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denison Kitchel, Barry Goldwater's influential 1964 presidential
campaign manager and longtime friend and advisor, has died. He was
94.</LD>
<LD>   Kitchel died Oct. 10 at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz. No cause of
death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed as Goldwater's campaign manager in January 1964, Kitchel
was a virtual unknown in national politics.</LD>
<TE>   But he had known the Arizona senator since Goldwater's days
running the family's Phoenix department store in 1935. He ran
Goldwater's successful 1952 Senate campaign and continued to be the
blunt-spoken, conservative Republican's most influential advisor.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1964 presidential campaign, Kitchel fostered
Goldwater's support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
he persuaded Goldwater to concede he was wrong in originally opposing
the Supreme Court school integration decision and the use of federal
troops to enforce that decision in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Kitchel relished strategizing, dealing with issues and drafting
policies, such as Goldwater's Senate speech in which he explained his
vote against the civil rights bill.</TE>
<TE>   Politics, he could do without.</TE>
<TE>   When a mother placed her baby in Goldwater's arms during the New
Hampshire primary, Kitchel muttered from the sidelines, "If he kisses
that baby, I resign."</TE>
<TE>   Kitchel was born in Bronxville, N.Y. He graduated from Yale
University in 1930 and, after graduating from Harvard Law School in
1933, he joined the Phoenix law firm of Ellinwood &amp; Ross, which
became Evans, Kitchel &amp; Jenckes.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which closed its doors in 1990 after 79 years, was one
of Arizona's most influential. Chief among the prominent lawyers and
judges Evans, Kitchel &amp; Jenckes produced was Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who began working at the firm in 1953 after graduating at
the top of his law school class at Stanford and clerking for Supreme
Court Justice Robert Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Kitchel, who served in the Army Air Corps in England during World
War II and was discharged as a lieutenant colonel, was considered an
authority on constitutional, labor and international law.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote two books: "Too Grave a Risk" (1963), in which he argued
it would be dangerous to yield U.S. sovereignty to a world court
dominated by nations with legal systems different from ours; and "The
Truth About Panama" (1978), which dealt with the consequences of
agreements between the United States and Panama.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as general counsel for the Arizona State Republican
Committee (1957-63). In 1958, he wrote the platform of the Arizona
Republican Party, in which he summarized his conservative philosophy
in eight brief paragraphs. A sample excerpt:</TE>
<TE>   "The preservation of freedom demands that governmental restraints
be kept at a minimum and that both freedom of association and the
right to work is protected."</TE>
<TE>   Kitchel is survived by his wife, Naomi; two sons, James of
Scottsdale and Harvey of San Diego; and four grandchildren.</TE>

campaign manager for Barry Goldwater, he did not really like

<HD>All-Latino Racing Unit a First for NASCAR</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cousins Rudy Rodriguez and Mike Vazquez are hoping for a four-year
dream to become a reality this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The pair are co-owners of the Hispanic Racing Team (HRT), which
they formed in 1999 seeking to bring diversity to the NASCAR racing
circuit. Sunday, at the Atlanta Motor Speedway, it will be the first
NASCAR race team where the owners, driver and primary sponsors are
Latino.</LD>
<LD>   Driving the HRT car will be Colombian native Roberto Guerrero,
whose previous driving experience comes on Formula One, CART and Indy
Racing League tracks. The car is sponsored by Ciclon, a South
American energy drink company.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very exciting for us in the respect that our dream is
finally coming to fruition," said Rodriguez, a founding member of the
NASCAR Diversity Council who grew up in Dallas but now, like Vazquez,
lives in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "We've overcome the obstacles and roadblocks over the years and
now we are finally ready to make our [all-Latin] debut in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   HRT has been in three races, but each time the car was driven by
Kentucky native David Green, the 1994 NASCAR Busch champion.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which was the last American League team to win the
World Series in its first appearance?</TE>
<TE>   Lighting it up: Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune has
hopped on the Chargers' bandwagon after the team's surprising 6-1
start.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rams, Ravens and Patriots, the past three Super Bowl winners,
were nobodies before they won. It's the way of the NFL these days.
The Chargers have been nobodies for six years, so they have
impeccable credentials."</TE>
<TE>   Stay put, Tito: Oscar De La Hoya is pressing Felix Trinidad for a
rematch. But HBO boxing columnist Ivan Goldman hopes Trinidad resists
De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   "Much as I would love to see it, a fighter deserves the right to
hang up his gloves without everybody jumping all over him to come
back," Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "So few fighters retire at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Not pretty but effective: Dallas running back Emmitt Smith can
break the all-time NFL rushing record this weekend against Seattle.
ESPN columnist Eric Neel thinks Smith should be appreciated for more
than longevity.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe kids don't imitate him on playgrounds and fans don't talk
about his signature moves, but ... there's a kind of
heart-of-the-matter poetry about Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "If you watch him closely, he lets you see how the game hinges on
hints and hesitations, on leanings and reaches, and on the razor-thin
difference between a blow that comes straight on and one that glances
off a hip or shoulder pad."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1994, Atlanta's Greg Maddux became
the first pitcher to win three straight Cy Young awards.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Toronto won the 1992 World Series, four games to
two, over Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Tennessee women's basketball Coach Pat Summitt:
"So many people get their identity through sports, and we have to
remember that's what they do and not what they are."</TE>

<HD>Ejection of Redlands' Coach Is Upheld</HD>

<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redlands football Coach Jim Walker will miss his first game in 21
years as a high school coach after his ejection from last week's game
was upheld.</LD>
<LD>   Safety Rocky McBroom, a three-year starter who was also ejected in
the final minutes of a 19-14 loss to Rialto Eisenhower, will be
eligible to play Friday against Fontana Miller because the officials
rescinded his ejection this week.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Walker went to the Southern Section office with
Redlands East Valley Principal Tom Davis, the Citrus Belt League's
representative to the California Interscholastic Federation. They
presented section officials with a game tape and argued that the
referees had erred in ejecting the coach and player from the game.</LD>
<TE>   The section turned Redlands' appeal over to the liaison of
officials for the Inland Football Officials Assn., which upheld
Walker's ejection and reversed McBroom's. "We told [Walker and Davis]
that there is a process to follow, and this is it," said Rob Wigod,
an assistant commissioner with the Southern Section. "We stand by the
officials' ruling and the matter is closed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Alvia, a senior defensive back and special teams player for
Gardena Serra, has been in an induced coma since being injured in a
car accident Sunday, Coach Scott Altenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tough week," Altenberg said. "We've been thinking
about him, and we've all come together around this. But it really
kind of puts everything in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Alvia suffered bleeding and swelling of the brain and has been
comatose in the intensive-care unit of St. Francis Medical Center in
Lynwood since his arrival, according to Altenberg.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of Alvia's family, the hospital would not release
any information, hospital spokeswoman Carol Lee Thorpe said.</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   La Verne Damien (5-1, 1-0) at Chino (6-0, 1-0), 7 p.m., Friday</LD>
<LD>   Chino, ranked No. 2 by The Times, made its debut in the Sierra
League last week with a 26-0 victory over Glendora. The challenge
should be significantly greater against No. 21 Damien, which opened
league play with a 24-21 come-from-behind victory over Diamond Bar.
The Cowboys defeated Damien, 42-19, last season in the quarterfinals
of the Southern Section Division II playoffs, but might have to face
the Spartans without running back Jacob Flowe, who has 17 touchdowns
but left last week's game in the second quarter with a sprained
ankle.</LD>
<TE>   San Clemente (4-2, 1-0) at Mission Viejo (6-0, 1-0), 7:30 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   Beau Budde's broken foot still hasn't healed, which means No. 15
San Clemente will try to end No. 3 Mission Viejo's 20-game winning
streak with backup quarterback Cole Bergquist, who passed for 266
yards and two touchdowns in last week's 28-20 victory over Mission
Viejo Trabuco Hills. Mission Viejo scored 24 points off turnovers in
its 37-0 victory over Lake Forest El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Country Canyon (6-0, 1-0) vs. Newhall Hart (5-0-1, 1-0) at
College of the Canyons, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   It's like old times in the Santa Clarita Valley, where resurgent
Canyon will try to end No. 5 Hart's 54-game Foothill League win
streak. Canyon has been helped by the return of junior linebacker
Andrew Schantz, who missed the first three games recovering from a
broken foot. Hart quarterback Sean Norton has attempted 184 passes
without an interception and thrown 20 touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (6-0, 1-0) vs. Inglewood (4-2, 1-0) at
Inglewood Coleman Stadium, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The Bay League champion will likely be determined tonight. Mira
Costa rolled to a 42-0 victory over Peninsula in its league opener.
Quarterback Peter Dobush and running back Michael Okwo sparked the
No. 7 Mustangs to a 35-0 halftime lead. Inglewood had a tougher time
in its league opener, a 36-20 victory over Leuzinger, but running
backs Brian Flowers, Renaldo Davis and Solomon Jones and quarterback
Troy Durk cannot be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (5-0-1, 1-0) vs. Anaheim Esperanza (6-0, 1-0) at
Placentia Valencia HS, 7 p.m., Saturday</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Los Alamitos is a power even with quarterback Justin Elway
sidelined a second consecutive week with a separated shoulder. Jeff
Kline threw for 175 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 118 yards
and two more scores in a 42-21 victory over Huntington Beach. Rick
Taloa, who has thrown for 12 touchdowns with only three
interceptions, leads No. 8 Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Venice (5-1, 3-0) at Westchester (5-1, 3-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Two contrasting styles meet in a game that will likely determine
the Western League championship. Pass-happy Venice features senior
quarterback Eddie Miller, who has completed 71.5% of his attempts for
1,890 yards and 16 touchdowns. The run-oriented Comets feature
Brandon Hampton, who has gained 848 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winning times have returned for the Canyon Country Canyon football
team.</LD>
<LD>   But just how far the Cowboys have come -- or how far they still
have to go to become an elite team -- under Coach Harry Welch will be
answered Friday night when they play Southern Section power Newhall
Hart in a Foothill League game at College of the Canyons at 7:30.</LD>
<LD>   Canyon is off to a 6-0 start for the first time since 1986 and
ranked ninth in the section's Division II poll. But Hart (5-0-1), No.
2 in Division II and No. 5 in The Times' rankings, has won the last
four Division III titles, is unbeaten in 28 games in a row and has
won 54 consecutive league games.</LD>
<TE>   Hart's last loss in league play was a 42-35 decision to Montebello
Schurr in 1990, which is also the last year Canyon beat the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Hart has won its last 11 games against its Santa Clarita Valley
rival by an average of 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel we're a year away from being a real good team," said
Welch, who is in the second year of his second coaching stint at
Canyon. "To be frank, we're getting to be a pretty good high school
football team, but [Hart is] at a completely different level."</TE>
<TE>   That shouldn't diminish what Welch, 57, and his assistant coaches
have accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon won consecutive section titles from 1983 to '85 and posted
a 120-31-2 record during Welch's first stint at the school from 1982
to '93. But the sometimes controversial coach resigned after the 1993
season, in which the Cowboys were 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon was a combined 32-42-1 in the seven seasons after Welch
stepped down and went 3-7 in his return. But the Cowboys beat
Lancaster, Santa Ana Saddleback, Crescenta Valley, Palmdale Highland
and Mission Hills Alemany in their first five games before upsetting
Valencia, 20-14, in a league opener.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (3-3) advanced to two of the previous three Division III
title games and hadn't lost to the Cowboys since the school began
playing varsity football in 1996, but Canyon limited highly touted
tailback Charles Burnley to 58 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely. Dumbfounded," Welch said when asked if he was
surprised by Canyon's 6-0 record. "I didn't expect this. But we've
had some breaks, and about a half-dozen starters who missed some
games early in the season with injuries are starting to get healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Canyon has been helped by the play of quarterback Nate Longshore
and running back Louis Montano. Longshore is a 6-foot-4, 214-pound
junior who has thrown for 1,131 yards and nine touchdowns. Montano is
a 5-8, 176-pound junior who has gained 776 yards and scored 10
touchdowns.</TE>

<TE>   Riverside North's school colors are blue and gold, but the Huskies
wore red jerseys in a 34-14 victory over Riverside Poly last Friday
in honor of alumnus Adam Kennedy and the Angels' first World Series
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   North Principal Dave Kinnear brought up the idea of donning red
jerseys at a faculty meeting three days after Kennedy hit three home
runs in the Angels' American League championship series-clinching
victory over the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Jim McNamara cleared the idea with football
Coach Steve Hagerty and ordered the jerseys later that day.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kennedy, Adam's father and a longtime history teacher at
North, was presented with a red jersey with the No. 2 on it in a
pregame ceremony Friday. But he was more tickled when the North
players ran onto the field minutes before the game in red jerseys
after warming up in traditional blue.</TE>

<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure is playing in the Channel League this
season after winning six consecutive Tri-Valley League titles. But a
private school from Ventura County could still stand in the way of
Carpinteria's quest for its first league championship since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Carpinteria (6-0, 3-0) is the top-ranked team in Division XI, but
No. 4 Westlake Village Oaks Christian (6-0, 2-0) will play the
Warriors at home Friday night at 7:30.</TE>
<TE>   "They do a lot of things real well," Carpinteria Coach Coley
Candaele said of an Oaks Christian team playing its second year at
the varsity level. "They don't run a lot of different plays, but they
run them out of a lot of different formations. They find your
weaknesses and attack you."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Adam Richter has gained 1,077 yards and scored 14
touchdowns for Oaks Christian, but the Lions could be even more
explosive if sophomore Aaron Ware has fully recovered from an injury
to his left hip, sustained in a 63-21 season-opening victory over
Santa Ana Calvary Chapel.</TE>

<TE>   When Paso Robles defeated Arroyo Grande, 12-10, in a Pac-5 League
opener last week, it marked the first time in two seasons that Arroyo
Grande had lost a regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were 9-0 during the regular season last year before
being upset by Goleta Dos Pueblos, 26-23, in a Division IV
quarterfinal game in the Division IV playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in two years we've had to practice after a
loss," said 20th-year Arroyo Grande Coach Jon Huss. "It's different."</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande, the No. 2-ranked team in Division IV, is expected
to have another tough game Friday when it plays host to No. 5 Santa
Maria Righetti (6-0, 1-0) at 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Righetti junior Ryan Mole has rushed for 940 yards and 13
touchdowns in 79 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior Brandon King, a middle linebacker at Arroyo Grande, will
miss the rest of the season after breaking his lower left leg in last
week's game against Paso Robles.... Senior Bryan Price of Oaks
Christian could miss the rest of the season after breaking a bone in
his leg in a 36-14 victory at Lompoc Cabrillo last week. Price is
expected to be out 4-6 weeks.... Senior Mario Vargas of Simi Valley
Royal is expected to miss the next three games after tearing the
medial collateral ligament in his right knee during pregame drills
last week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors in Boris Becker's tax evasion trial at Munich, Germany,
on Wednesday sought a 3 1/2-year jail sentence for the retired tennis
great, while lawyers for the three-time Wimbledon champion sought
probation.</LD>
<LD>   Becker, 34, is accused of evading more than $1.7 million in taxes
from 1991-93, when he listed his residency as Monte Carlo but stayed
at his sister's Munich loft.</LD>
<LD>   Becker admitted he kept an apartment in Germany 10 years ago while
claiming to reside in the tax haven of Monte Carlo.</LD>
<TE>   He said the investigation into his finances helped end his career.</TE>
<TE>   Joerg Weigell, Becker's lawyer, said Becker has paid $3 million in
back taxes for 1991-95.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors insisted Becker waited until the last minute to pay
and didn't admit his guilt until taken to court.</TE>
<TE>   Becker said he was aware of German laws that anyone who lives more
than half the year in Germany has to pay taxes in the country but
insisted he only stayed in his sister's loft occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the rules and I took them into account," Becker said. "I
accept that I am responsible for a mistake that I made 10 years ago
and I know that I have to pay for that."</TE>

<HD>Police Pursuing Tanner</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- Roscoe Tanner, the former Australian Open champion and Davis
Cup winner, on Wednesday denied allegations of fraud as police in
Florida revealed that they are actively seeking his arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Tanner, 51, a Davis Cup winner in 1981 and former Wimbledon
finalist, is accused of swindling Tampa yacht broker Gene Gammon out
of $36,000 over the purchase of a yacht, and faces arrest if he
returns to the United States. He is currently in Karlsruhe, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   "I am sorting it," Tanner, who served as the director of tennis at
the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks from its inception in 1989
to 1995, said of the fraud allegation. "I haven't skipped off with
anybody's money."</LD>
<TE>   Arrest warrants were issued last year for Tanner, the 1977
Australian Open champion, on allegations of grand theft, passing a
worthless check and a failure to maintain child support payments.
Gammon alleges that a check for the 32-foot yacht bounced, and Tanner
skipped the country before the broker was able to get the money back.</TE>
<TE>   Tanner claimed he would follow "the proper methods, whatever the
proper methods are," to answer the charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   However, neither the Florida State Attorney's Office, nor the
Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, who are investigating the fraud
allegations, had heard from Tanner on Wednesday and confirmed that
the criminal claims stand.</TE>

<HD>It's War Emblem, but Just by a Nose</HD>
<DH>Kentucky Derby, Preakness winner is made 3-1 favorite for
Classic. Medaglia d'Oro at 7-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. -- Trainer Bobby Frankel was surprised War
Emblem, one of the roadblocks for his two horses in Saturday's
$4-million Breeders' Cup Classic, would be installed as the
morning-line favorite for the 1 1/4-mile race.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as current form is concerned, my horse [Medaglia d'Oro]
should be the favorite," Frankel said. "War Emblem's form hasn't been
that good lately."</LD>
<LD>   War Emblem won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, but there have
been gaping chinks in his reputation since May. He ran eighth in the
Belmont, missing a sweep of the Triple Crown, then beat up on mostly
second-rate competition while winning the Haskell and finished sixth
in the Pacific Classic, his first start outside the 3-year-old
division. Trainer Bob Baffert blamed bad starts for the losses in the
Belmont and the Pacific Classic, and on Saturday at Arlington Park,
with 12 horses entered and a crowd of almost 49,000 expected, swift
loading and clean breaks are no guarantees.</LD>
<TE>   Still, longtime linemaker Mike Battaglia, almost apologetic, made
War Emblem the 3-1 favorite when post positions were drawn Wednesday,
and listed Medaglia d'Oro, a 13 1/2-length winner of the Jim Dandy
and a narrow winner over Repent in the Travers, as the second choice
at 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   "This race was almost as tough as this year's Kentucky Derby,"
said Battaglia, who also writes the line at Churchill Downs. "There
were four horses that I could have made the favorite."</TE>
<TE>   Besides War Emblem and Medaglia d'Oro, Battaglia was referring to
Came Home, who's 4-1 after winning the Pacific Classic, and Hawk
Wing, from Ireland, who's 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to talk about, but it really doesn't make much
difference, does it?" Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a horseman might not want to be favored in the Classic, a
race in which only five favorites have won in 18 years, and just one
-- Skip Away in 1997 -- in the last six runnings. If War Emblem -- or
any other contender -- goes off at 3-1, it will be the highest price
on a Classic favorite since Tabasco Cat closed at 7-2 while running
second to Concern in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised War Emblem is favored," Baffert deadpanned.
"He's got the best trainer. Seriously, I think he deserves to be
favored. He has the best credentials of anybody in the field."</TE>
<TE>   While Baffert expects War Emblem and his jockey, Victor Espinoza,
to be setting the pace, the way the colt won the Derby and the
Haskell, the trainer is concerned that a well-rested E Dubai, while a
12-1 longshot, has the early speed to possibly keep War Emblem from
getting away unfettered. In his last start, on July 6 at Belmont
Park, E Dubai was a gate-to-wire winner in the Suburban Handicap,
which was run at the same distance as the Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to see E Dubai running," Baffert said. "He's a
pretty fast horse, and he could probably hurt us up front. We'll need
racing luck and we need to get out of the gate all right."</TE>
<TE>   Before the late Ahmed bin Salman, the Saudi Arabian prince who
died in July, spent $900,000 for 90% of War Emblem less than three
weeks before the Derby, the colt was a Chicago-based horse. Under his
original trainer, Bobby Springer, War Emblem broke in at Arlington
last October, beating maidens in his first start and running seventh
the only time he has been on grass. Chicago bettors helped pound War
Emblem down to 4-5 when he won in March at Sportsman's Park in
suburban Cicero. Three weeks later, just days before the prince made
his move, War Emblem won the Illinois Derby at Sportsman's in his
last start for Springer.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel's other Classic starter is Milwaukee Brew, the Santa Anita
Handicap winner but winless since June and an uninspiring 15-1 on the
morning line. Frankel, like Baffert, will send out seven horses in
all on the eight-race, $13-million Breeders' Cup card. A fast track
is likely, but the temperature is not expected to get much above 50
degrees, which would still be a high for the week.</TE>
<TE>   Although Frankel, with one title, and Baffert, with three, have
dominated the national purse list in the last four years and are 1-2
in the current standings, they have not blown the doors off the
opposition in the Breeders' Cup. Frankel, who was elected to the
Racing Hall of Fame in 1995, ran 38 horses in the year-end series
before saddling Squirtle Squirt to win the Sprint last year. Baffert,
who has won eight of the last 15 Triple Crown races, has two
Breeders' Cup wins, but he has failed to win with 17 starts since
Silverbulletday gave him a victory in the Juvenile Fillies in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first Breeders' Cup where I'm feeling as confident as
I am this time," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   Favorites in the other races are:</TE>
<TE>   * High Chaparral, at 8-5 in the $2-million Turf. The scratch of
Blazing Fury, because of a tendon injury, reduced the field to eight,
smallest in history.</TE>
<TE>   * Azeri, 6-5 in the $2-million Distaff, which has an intriguing
West-East matchup between the favorite and Take Charge Lady.</TE>
<TE>   * Sky Mesa, winner of all three starts and 3-1 in the $1-million
Juvenile. The potential spoilers are Baffert and Irish trainer Aidan
O'Brien, with three starters apiece.</TE>
<TE>   * Storm Flag Flying, even money in the $1-million Juvenile
Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   * Orientate, winner of four straight, at 5-2 for the $1-million
Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   * Rock Of Gibraltar, even money in the $1-million Mile.</TE>
<TE>   * Golden Apples, 5-2 in the Filly and Mare Turf.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who has seven starters, toyed with running Rock Of
Gibraltar in the Classic instead of the Mile. Sanity set in. The
3-year-old colt has won a record seven straight Group One races in
Europe and is five for five at a mile.</TE>
<TE>   For Battaglia, Rock Of Gibraltar's place in the Mile was only a
matter of a number or two. "I was going to make him 7-5," he said.
"But then I took another look at his last two races and made him even
lower."</TE>

<HD>Gentry Finally Has Some Good News</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after expressing his frustration over the Clippers' many
injuries, Coach Alvin Gentry said he would have all but small forward
Lamar Odom, backup forward Melvin Ely and backup guard Bryant Stith
available for Wednesday's season-opening game against the Cleveland
Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry said Wednesday a sprained right ankle probably would
sideline Odom until Christmas. The status of Ely (sore toe) and Stith
(knee surgery) is less certain, but it means the Clippers won't be at
full strength for perhaps the season's first two months.</LD>
<LD>   It also remains to be seen how effective recently recovered
Clippers such as power forward Elton Brand, center Michael Olowokandi
and guard Quentin Richardson will be early on.</LD>
<TE>   Brand and Olowokandi missed all eight exhibitions, including
Wednesday's 115-107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks at Staples Center.
Richardson played for the first time, scoring 12 points in 30
minutes. Wang Zhizhi, in his Clipper debut, had three points and four
rebounds in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "What's been tough is that we didn't have the opportunity for all
our guys to play major minutes in preseason," Gentry said. "All our
guys haven't had a chance to play with Andre [Miller, the Clippers'
new point guard]. After the second day of camp, we didn't get a lot
done. We didn't have the guys available who are going to be playing
because of all the injuries."</TE>
<TE>   With Miller at the point, "we've changed things," Gentry said. "It
won't be hard to pick up for Elton and for Michael. But it's the
timing of it. Your timing is going to be off if you're not out there
right from the start."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has said repeatedly that he doesn't put much stock in
exhibition records, but that he also doesn't discount all that
happens in October.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to play against competition," he said. "You get a gauge
of where you are. It's good for the guys to have someone else to look
at."</TE>

<LD>Although the NHL season is only two weeks old, the Mighty Ducks will
start what may be the most important trip of the season tonight at
Vancouver.</LD>
<LD>   Five games in a week in cities where they have gone winless over
the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at Vancouver, where the Canucks have won six in a row
over the Ducks at General Motors Place, Anaheim will play at
Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Boston. The Ducks have not won on the
road against the Oilers since Feb. 24, 1999, and they've lost their
last five games combined at Toronto and Montreal.</LD>
<TE>   Anaheim's most recent win on the road against any of their
opponents on this trip was Jan. 31, 2000, against the Bruins. Which
only makes the next week more difficult for the 2-3-1 Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "The start of the season has pretty much gone as expected because
we have so many new faces and a new coaching staff," defenseman Keith
Carney said. "We're still trying to find our style of hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "We can use this road trip as a scale to see where we're at. It's
a good time for us as a team to be out on the road and focus on our
game."</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of the season, first-year Coach Mike Babcock has
juggled his forward lines nearly every game in an attempt to find the
right mix. But after the Ducks' strong effort against Colorado on
Sunday, Babcock will stick with the same combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya will skate with Steve Rucchin and Mike Leclerc; Adam
Oates will team with Alexei Smirnov and Petr Sykora; Andy McDonald
will line up with Matt Cullen and Stanislav Chistov; and Dan Bylsma,
Marc Chouinard and Kevin Sawyer will make up the checking line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks traded defenseman Jason York to Nashville for future
considerations Wednesday. York, 32, played last season with the Ducks
but was assigned to Cincinnati of the American Hockey League before
the start of this season. York had three goals and five points in
four games with Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will pick up a portion of York's contract, which will
pay him $4 million over the next two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Vancouver, 7</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site -- General Motors Place.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 2-3-1-0, Canucks 3-2-2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Canucks -- 0-0-1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Anaheim blew a late lead and had to settle for a 2-2 tie
against Vancouver last week. The Ducks will start first-year
goaltender Martin Gerber, who stopped 22 shots in his first NHL start
against the Avalanche. Kariya has a four-game point streak, and
McDonald leads the Ducks in scoring with two goals and six points.
Before the Ducks' morning skate today, Kariya will be presented with
his ring for being part of Canada's gold medal-winning Olympic team.</TE>

<HD>Irish Might Wake Up in Pasadena</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a 1968 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, Mitch
Dorger was among the jet-setters cheering last weekend for the
Falcons to upset Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   As Rose Bowl chief executive officer, however, Dorger might have
come away a winner either way, because Notre Dame's 21-14 victory
over the Falcons kept alive the back-door possibility of the Irish
playing in Pasadena on Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   This was supposed to be a return-to-normalcy campaign for the Rose
Bowl, which last season broke its Pacific 10 vs. Big Ten covenant for
the chance to host the bowl championship series national title game
-- and what a game that was.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, while it seems a cinch the Pac-10 will take its traditional
place in the Jan. 1 game this year, the Big Ten's situation remains
clouded.</TE>
<TE>   Should Ohio State, 8-0 and No. 6 in this week's first BCS
rankings, secure either the first or second spot in the BCS, the
Buckeyes would play for the national title in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Under BCS guidelines, the Rose Bowl would not have to take the Big
Ten runner-up. In fact, the Rose Bowl could not take another Big Ten
school unless it had a top-12 BCS ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Irish wild card.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, at 11-1 or even 10-2, might fill the Big Ten's spot
and make its first appearance in the Rose Bowl since 1925.</TE>
<TE>   That game marked the farewell ride for Knute Rockne's "Four
Horsemen" as the Irish claimed their first of 11 national titles with
a 27-10 victory over Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 1924 Notre Dame team that inspired sportswriter
Grantland Rice to write, after the Irish defeated Army at the Polo
Grounds, "Outlined against a blue, gray October sky the Four Horsemen
rode again."</TE>
<TE>   It has been 77 years since the Irish hitched a post in Pasadena,
but Dorger says the Rose Bowl is exploring all scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an interesting dialogue," he said of the Notre Dame
question.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish-to-Pasadena plan only works under specific scenarios. It
requires a 12-0 Ohio State having to vacate the Rose Bowl to play for
the national title.</TE>
<TE>   It also requires 6-1 Iowa to stumble. If Iowa, currently No. 13 in
the BCS, finishes 11-1 but second in the Big Ten, the Rose Bowl would
be obligated, if only morally, to take the Hawkeyes over Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Dorger says the Rose Bowl would do nothing to damage the
long-standing relationship with the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   "If Iowa runs the table, and is a fabulous top-10 team, then I
mean it's a pretty easy decision," Dorger said.</TE>
<TE>   Things could get interesting, however, if the at-large Rose Bowl
spot comes down to a choice between two-loss Michigan and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   This assumes Michigan's second defeat comes next month at Ohio
State and the Wolverines play well enough against the Buckeyes not to
drop out of the BCS top 12. Michigan made its debut at No. 8 in the
first BCS rankings.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl could make the case that Notre Dame defeated
Michigan this season, but also is aware of the politics involved.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan and Notre Dame are fierce rivals and some in the Big Ten
still are miffed Notre Dame rebuffed a chance to join the conference
a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's aware of Notre Dame's draw, and what it would do to
the ratings of the game," Dorger said of the Irish playing in the
Rose Bowl. "But we're also very mindful how successful a highly rated
Big Ten team that might be second would be. We are first and foremost
a partnership."</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany told the Chicago Tribune this week
he would lobby hard on behalf of his conference.</TE>
<TE>   "They had two visitors last year," Delany said of the Rose Bowl's
hosting Miami and Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   If Ohio State goes to the Fiesta Bowl and neither Iowa nor
Michigan is BCS eligible, Notre Dame becomes the Rose Bowl's
no-brainer choice.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish question becomes moot if Ohio State doesn't finish first
or second in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, the Big Ten will send either Ohio State, Michigan or
Iowa to the Rose Bowl, but in the bowl business you always have to
plan for "what if?"</TE>
<TE>   Dorger: "We are cognizant of all the possibilities and are
watching them very closely."</TE>
<TE>   Wanted: Heisman Candidate</TE>
<TE>   We're starting to seriously wonder if anyone wants to win this
year's Heisman Trophy. Voters would have been glad to hand Miami
quarterback Ken Dorsey the hardware as a lifetime achievement award,
but his numbers are only so-so and he might only be the third best
player in his huddle.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State quarterback Seneca Wallace emerged as a clear-cut
front-runner in last week's Rocky Mountain News weekly Heisman survey
but got the trap-door treatment after his abysmal showing Saturday
against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall quarterback Byron Leftwich probably blew his chance with
a loss against Virginia Tech, Ohio State freshman tailback Maurice
Clarett fumbled three times against Northwestern, Washington State
quarterback Jason Gesser has been brilliant except for that
Heisman-killer loss against Ohio State. Oregon tailback Onterrio
Smith seemed like an interesting alternative before the Ducks lost to
Arizona State last week.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State quarterback Philip Rivers leads the nation in
pass efficiency but also in victories led against second-rate
competition.</TE>
<TE>   So what are we left with? Probably Willis McGahee, a Miami
sophomore tailback and a man about whom the nation knows zilch.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State's freight train tailback Greg Jones, who reminds
some of Earl Campbell, could get a front-row Heisman seat if he can
run over Notre Dame this week the way he ran through Miami two weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach was furious on the Big 12 Conference
call this week about the lack of publicity afforded his quarterback
candidate, Kliff Kingsbury, who has thrown for 2,916 yards and 28
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it's irresponsible on their part," Leach said of the
media.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, coach, is that your team has lost three games against
top-25 teams -- Iowa State, North Carolina State and Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Kingsbury can be an instant player in this
anyone's-guess campaign if Texas Tech wins this week at Colorado. It
doesn't help Kingsbury's cause that Red Raider fans reportedly
returned 1,748 of their allotted 3,850 tickets for this weekend's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Could this be the year the Downtown Athletic Club gives the
Heisman to that consummate team player, "None of the Above"?</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   BCS nuts-and-bolts: You may wish to spew venom on the system, but
it does make for strange bedfellows. Miami fans, for instance, need
rival Florida State to defeat Notre Dame this weekend to improve
Miami's national title chances. Why? If Florida State, No. 13 in the
BCS, finishes in the BCS top 10, Miami receives quality win points
for having defeated Florida State. Same story for Oklahoma as it
relates to Texas. The higher No. 10 Texas finishes in the BCS, the
more quality-win points Oklahoma receives. "That's the thing about
the BCS," BCS coordinator Michael Tranghese said. "Games that
otherwise would not have attracted peoples' attention really have
bearing."</TE>
<TE>   Good thing Miami and Virginia Tech didn't debut as No. 1 and No. 2
in the first BCS standings or else Tranghese, the BCS chief and Big
East Commissioner, would have had to answer charges that the fix was
in, right? "Some people asked me about that last week and I laughed
at them," Tranghese said. "I said 'I hope they're No. 1 and No. 2,
because it helps our conference.' "</TE>
<TE>   There has been a major power outage at Brigham Young, which has
scored only 12 points in its last two games. The Cougars needed Matt
Payne's 24-yard field goal last week against Nevada Las Vegas to
extend the school's NCAA record for consecutive games scoring record
to 345. Arizona State, in 1975, was the last school to hold BYU
scoreless. And no, all you Mormon mission wise acres out there, not
even BYU has a player on its current roster who was alive then.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't think Notre Dame football sells soap, think again:
Saturday night's rating for Notre Dame vs. Air Force was ESPN's
highest for college football since a 1999 broadcast of Notre Dame vs.
Tennessee. Never mind that because of the 10 p.m. Eastern start,
Notre Dame players didn't return to campus in South Bend, Ind., until
6 a.m. Sunday. Remember, though, it's all about the student athletes.</TE>
<TE>   To give you another idea about how television calls the shots,
Virginia Tech played its first home Saturday game of the season last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when Florida State used to fill the air with footballs?
Oddly, the story line entering Saturday's showdown is how Florida
State's No. 15 rushing attack will fare against Notre Dame's No. 6
rushing defense. The Seminoles' passing game ranks 70th nationally.
If Florida State can manage a few completions this week, it might be
able to overtake 0-7 Army, which ranks No. 69.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Faine, Notre Dame's senior center, grew up in Florida and
attended Seminole High, but said the lure of the Golden Dome made him
choose Notre Dame over Florida State. As for Notre Dame being
double-digit underdogs this week, Faine quipped, "Coming into this
season we were supposed to lose seven games, so it doesn't surprise
me."</TE>
<TE>   In a bit of directional school news, No. 88 Northwestern inched
ahead of No. 89 Northeastern in this week's Sagarin Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham claims not to know much about
Notre Dame's storied rivalry with Florida State -- memo to coach, the
1993 matchup was billed "The Game of the Century" -- but he does say
this about the Seminoles: "The football team is, in my estimation,
two points away from being No. 1 in the country."</TE>

<LD>Defensive tackle Jermaine Brooks, an Arkansas co-captain, was kicked
off the team Wednesday after he was arrested on charges he sold and
possessed 10 1/2 pounds of marijuana in his off-campus apartment in
Fayetteville, Ark.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks, 22, from Pasadena, was charged with felonies alleging drug
possession, drug distribution and simultaneous possession of several
rifles and handguns. Officers found $16,841 in Brooks' apartment and
also arrested a woman, Auburn Celeste Williams, 21.</LD>
<LD>   A prosecutor said Brooks, if convicted of simultaneous possession
of drugs and a gun, could be punished by life in prison, although
that would be rare in a marijuana case. Brooks was released on $7,500
bond and his arraignment was scheduled for Nov. 18.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong safety Maurice Sikes will not start for No. 1 Miami at West
Virginia because he missed a team meeting.... Receiver Reggie Love,
who leads Duke with 22 catches, will miss the rest of the season
because of torn ligaments in his left knee.... Colorado running back
Marcus Houston, who partially tore a ligament in his right knee on
Aug. 31, could play against Texas Tech.... Purdue will start Brandon
Kirsch at quarterback against Northwestern. The Wildcats are
expecting to have quarterback Brett Basanez, recovering from a
fractured fibula, back in the lineup.... Illinois will stay with
Dustin Ward as its quarterback against Indiana.... Troy Nunes will
start at quarterback for Syracuse against Rutgers.... Tennessee
quarterback Casey Clausen (shoulder injury) is expected to start
against Alabama. Running back Cedric Houston (torn ligament, left
thumb) is also expected to play.... The Big Ten announced it will
allow teams to give more scholarships than they have available as
long as teams are at the maximum of 85 before the following season.
The change will put the conference on even ground with other
conferences.... Proposed NCAA rules changes could alter practice
routines. Among the changes: a strength or conditioning coach
certified in CPR to attend voluntary weight training or conditioning
drills, and only one practice during the first five days of fall
practice, thus eliminating two-a-day practices to start fall drills.
The NCAA's Board of Directors could approve the changes as early as
Oct. 31.</TE>

<LD>A 2-year-old son of Gentlemen, Man Among Men did not distinguish
himself in his debut June 22 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Dispatched at 14-1 in the field of eight, Man Among Men was last,
11 1/2 lengths behind winner Kafwain in the five-furlong race.</LD>
<LD>   Sent long on the turf a little more than two months later, the
chestnut looked like a different animal.</LD>
<TE>   Reserved off the early pace by jockey Alex Solis, Man Among Men
took over early in the stretch after making a bid three-wide and drew
off to win by 5 1/2 lengths at a healthy 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect anywhere near that price today as the promising colt
tries for his first stakes win in the $50,000 Pinjara at one mile on
the grass. Trained by Gary Mandella, Man Among Men is the 6-5
favorite in the field of eight and will break from Post 2.</TE>
<TE>   The second choice at 8-5 on Jeff Tufts' morning line is the Ed
Gann-owned and Bobby Frankel-trained entry of Bis Repetitas and Peace
Rules.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Java, Stylish Account, Gohalo, Jimmy O and Luzern make up the
rest of the field.</TE>

<HD>Palffy Returns After Missing Three Games</HD>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ziggy Palffy gave Coach Andy Murray the good news after Wednesday's
morning skate: After sitting out three games because of a strained
groin, the high-scoring winger was ready to return to the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll see how it's going to go," Palffy said before Wednesday
night's 3-3 tie against the Detroit Red Wings. "I don't feel any
pain, so no reason just to wait. We'll see what's going to happen. I
want to play 100%."</LD>
<LD>   Palffy, who assisted on Mathieu Schneider's second-period goal,
led the Kings with five shots on goal in 22 minutes 42 seconds of
playing time.</LD>
<TE>   Palffy said he felt a pop in his groin during the second period of
the Kings' 3-2 victory over the Red Wings on Oct. 12 at Staples
Center. He continued to play "and third period, all of a sudden, I
couldn't skate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Kings were surprised that he was sidelined 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   "These players know their own bodies, and we have to respect
that," Murray said. "We don't ever doubt Ziggy. If he says he's not
right, he's not right."</TE>
<TE>   And now that he's right?</TE>
<TE>   "I expect him to play better than he's ever played," Murray said.
"He's well rested, ready to go. If he says he can play, then he's
expected to play good."</TE>

<HD>Kings Rue Missed Point</HD>
<DH>They can't convert on several good chances and settle for
3-3 tie with Red Wings to start five-game trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DETROIT -- It's hard to complain after coming into the home of the
defending Stanley Cup champions, overcoming a late deficit in front
of a sellout crowd and stealing into the night with a well-earned
tie.</LD>
<LD>   But the Kings, opening a five-game trip, believed that their 3-3
tie with the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday night could just as
easily have been a victory.</LD>
<LD>   In front of the usual 20,058 in Joe Louis Arena, they watched a
first-period shot by Mikko Eloranta carom off a goalpost and another,
a point-blank attempt by Ziggy Palffy, sail harmlessly into the glove
of diving goaltender Curtis Joseph.</LD>
<TE>   They saw Bryan Smolinski, on a third-period scoring chance in
front of the net, get high- sticked by Red Wing defenseman Nicklas
Lidstrom so badly that the gash that opened just above Smolinski's
upper lip required eight stitches to close.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Kings, however, none of the officials saw
it.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings saw their power play regain some of its juice, scoring
two goals in eight man-advantage opportunities after going 0 for 15
in their previous three games.</TE>
<TE>   In the overtime, they saw the Red Wings give them an unexpected
power-play opportunity, only to rise up and kill it off. And then, in
the last 30 seconds, they watched Joseph deny Adam Deadmarsh on a
breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys were a little disappointed we didn't get two points,"
King center Jason Allison admitted, "but looking at the big picture,
we should be happy."</TE>
<TE>   That's because, if a shot by Allison hadn't deflected wildly (and
fortuitously for the Kings) off Lidstrom's skate and over Joseph's
right shoulder into the net with 10:25 to play in regulation, the
Kings probably would have lost.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose a game like that, it would be a shame because you
worked so darn hard," King Coach Andy Murray said. "But you also
realize you're playing the Red Wings and you don't have much choice
but to play that way to have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who got power-play goals from defenseman Lubomir
Visnovsky in the first period and defenseman Mathieu Schneider in the
second, twice lost one-goal leads before overcoming a one-goal
deficit after Sergei Fedorov gave the Red Wings a 3-2 lead with 13:34
remaining in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Lidstrom, who would have been in the penalty box if any of the
four officials had seen him clip Smolinski, assisted on Fedorov's
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski, who recoiled from the pain and fell sprawled to the ice
after he was hit, was asked later if he were shocked by the no-call.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, pretty much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lidstrom must have been shocked too after inadvertently assisting
on Allison's fourth goal in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Jumping off the bench and into the play on a line change, Allison
took a pass in the high slot from rookie Alexander Frolov and fired
toward Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to wrist it through Lidstrom, use him as a screen
and find a little lane," Allison said, shrugging. "Sometimes you get
those little tips and it goes in. Sometimes you hit him right in the
shin and it stops."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Deadmarsh nor Palffy, back in the lineup after sitting out
three games because of a strained groin, had to be reminded.</TE>
<TE>   "An unbelievable save," Smolinski said of Joseph's diving stop
against Palffy late in the first period. "Ziggy doesn't miss too many
of those. Nine out of 10 times he's going to make that, but Cujo
[Joseph] is a fantastic goalie."</TE>
<TE>   He'll get no argument from Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I put it in a pretty good spot," he said of his
point-blank shot in overtime, which Joseph turned away, "but I guess
not."</TE>

<HD>Magic Talked Into Staying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers are exploring ways to make Magic Johnson, their co-owner
and vice president, more valuable to the organization.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson this week told Seattle SuperSonic owner Howard Schultz
that he would remain with the Lakers, despite Schultz's offer of a
piece of the SuperSonics and various upper-management duties.</LD>
<LD>   Schultz had hoped to ride Johnson's name and know-how into a
potentially rich class of free agents next summer, using Johnson in
part as a recruiter.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, after receiving telephone calls from Laker owner
Jerry Buss and General Manager Mitch Kupchak, Johnson notified
Schultz of his decision to remain in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned it down," Johnson said. "I think now I just wait and
see. This opportunity may come back. Other opportunities could come
back as well. Or, I may just stay a Laker forever, and there's
nothing wrong with that. I'm very happy with where I am."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the organization said Johnson and Buss never came
to the point of negotiating Johnson's financial departure, a
transaction that would have meant determining the worth of Johnson's
5% stake in the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Johnson's attention was on his role with the SuperSonics
and the financial implications there. The Lakers are turning a large
profit, he said, while the SuperSonics are losing money.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, Johnson did not join Schultz because he
believed he could find career satisfaction with the Lakers, a theme
brought to him by Buss and Kupchak.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," Johnson said. "Those are conversations that
may have to take place a little later, but they will take place. I'll
tell you, a lot of good maybe can come of this. I'm looking forward
to sitting down with them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said Wednesday that Soumaila Samake and Guy
Rucker remain in competition for Shaquille O'Neal's temporary place
on the active roster, and that he let reporters believe Samake had
made the team because newspapers eventually "line the bottoms of
canary cages" anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Four nights before, Jackson had gone along with suggestions that
Samake had earned a place on the team, even suggesting that Samake
might be his opening-night starter against the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor Samake," Jackson said with a laugh. "I hope he didn't go to
the bank on it."</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that Jackson simply felt badly for Rucker, who's
had a good, energetic camp but lacks the size and reach of Samake,
and regretted having Rucker learn his fate from the newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson denied that, however, adding, "anybody with basketball
judgment" could see the battle between Rucker and Samake was too
close to call with two exhibition games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal hopes to be cleared to run during an examination today by
Dr. Robert Mohr, his surgeon. .... Devean George did not practice
Wednesday because of back spasms. Samaki Walker tried to practice,
but could not because of a bruised hip. .... The Lakers play the
Milwaukee Bucks tonight at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Dykstra's Dad Upset by Report</HD>
<DH>Father of comatose La Verne quarterback disputes coach's
comments and says son's headaches were severe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seriously injured University of La Verne quarterback Rollie Dykstra
reported severe headaches and was told by a team trainer that he
suffered a possible concussion in an Oct. 5 game, Dykstra's father
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Dykstra Sr., making his first public comments since his son
was hospitalized with a severe head injury after being tackled by a
University of Redlands player on Saturday, said Leopard Coach Don
Morel was inaccurate when he told reporters Tuesday that Rollie
Dykstra had not suffered a previous concussion and that the headaches
he reported were mild.</LD>
<LD>   "The concussion is not a rumor," Roland Dykstra said. "My son
talked to me two days after the Cal Lutheran game [Oct. 5] and
complained of serious headaches, especially when he would bend down."</LD>
<TE>   Roland Dykstra and Rollie's girlfriend, Jennifer Ross, said Rollie
spoke with a La Verne trainer about his discomfort on Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "He was told he probably had suffered a slight concussion," said
Ross, who resided with Dykstra near La Verne's campus.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said she was unsure when the injury took place. A source
close to the team said Dykstra was hit hard during the final minutes
of the Cal Lutheran game and was relieved by Gabe Lujan.</TE>
<TE>   Morel, head athletic trainer Jim May and La Verne spokeswoman
Deborah Mandabach refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rollie Dykstra, a 24-year-old senior who has a 3-year-old
daughter, remained in critical condition -- comatose and on life
support -- at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Dykstra said he told doctors that his son suffered "a
slight concussion two weeks before this."</TE>
<TE>   The university canceled Saturday's scheduled game against Azusa
Pacific and conducted a prayer service for Rollie Dykstra on
Wednesday, but the player's father said, "I went ballistic," after
reading Morel's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going on here, it's like the school is
preparing itself for something," Roland Dykstra said. "All I'm
worried about is my kid."</TE>
<TE>   Morel, in his ninth season as La Verne's coach, has acknowledged
that he limited his team to noncontact drills in the two weeks
between the 30-6 loss at Cal Lutheran and Saturday's home game
against Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Dykstra contends his son was told to not practice in a
helmet, "to just throw," by trainers concerned with his condition. He
said trainers discouraged his request for aspirin in practices,
"because it would mask the problem."</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him to make sure the trainers were taking care of him,"
Roland Dykstra said. "I even asked him not to play in the Redlands
game if he was still having [headaches].... He was a football player.
He wanted to play."</TE>

<LD>Meteoric, whose only loss in eight starts came in the All American
Futurity at Ruidoso Downs on Sept. 2, started a new winning streak
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, the 2-year-old earned the fastest qualifying time
for the $733,950 Golden State Futurity, which comes up Nov. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Dutch Masters III and trained by Lin Melton -- who had
two others, Royal Miracle Dip and Twotimesthefly, qualify for the
Futurity final -- Meteoric won his trial by three-quarters of a
length. He completed the 400 yards in 19.67 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the three Melton runners, the other qualifiers were First
Place Queen, Corona Caliente, The Blues Man and Lotta Bang (all of
whom are trained by John Bassett), Deefirst and Sum Special Strawfly
(both of whom are trained by Paul Jones) and Toll The Cash, who will
represent the Jaime Gomez barn.</TE>
<TE>   Special Queen SA was scratched out of the fifth trial because of a
cough.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Comes A Storm. 2. Miss Sky Dasher. 3. Malibu
Princess. 4. A Flyer. 5. Virlaka. 6. Fast Enough To Speed. 7. Aubrey
Ren. 8. A Dash Of Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single the entry of Virlaka-Key Line in the fifth; use Fast
Enough To Speed, the entry of Peggy Perfect-Tiffany Snow, Thru Grace
and Splasy For Glory in the sixth; Famous Cartel and Aubrey Ren in
the seventh; and Flying Sentinel, Corona Chaser, A Dash Of Apollo and
Karat Snapper in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Adans Baby Victory could improve in the second
after a troubled debut. Flying Tapestry makes his first start for
trainer Dan Luna in the fourth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Montgomery got his first glimpse of his son's future when he
realized 6-year-old Tim almost didn't need a head start in their
races around the family backyard in Gaffney, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't until after Tim broke his wrist and thumb twice
playing high school football and his mother, appalled by the medical
bills, asked him to try a less costly sport, that he learned about
his parents' contribution to his unique gift.</LD>
<LD>   Margie Montgomery, a lab technician for a textile company, was a
runner as a girl.</LD>
<TE>   "She never ran on the level where she ran against anybody, but she
told me how she chased a rabbit until its heart burst," Tim said.
"She chased it so hard and so long, its heart just stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Montgomery, a department manager for the same textile
company, was a sergeant in Vietnam, where he suffered a facial wound
and won a Purple Heart. Ask how long he was there and he responds
without missing a beat, "Twelve months, six days, three hours and 46
minutes." Yes, he was counting.</TE>
<TE>   "My father would always say, 'I was fast, and I could have been
this and I could have been that, but I had to go to war,' " Tim said.
"He'd say, 'When I was in the jungle, I was running through the woods
and no one could catch me or shoot me.'</TE>
<TE>   "They all got stories, because they're trying to figure out, 'How
did we have this?' "</TE>
<TE>   This is the world's fastest man, the third of Eddie and Margie's
four children and owner of the world record in the 100-meter dash
since he was clocked in 9.78 seconds at the Grand Prix final Sept. 14
in Paris, breaking Maurice Greene's 3-year-old record by .01 of a
second.</TE>
<TE>   "I had him playing pro football," Eddie Montgomery said by
telephone from Gaffney, where he and Margie still live. "But Tim got
onto the track and started saying he was going to compete in the
Olympics. I never brought it up. He said in ninth or 10th grade he
was going to the Olympics and he went. He participated and won a
silver medal [in 1996, for running a first-round heat of the
400-meter relay].</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing you know, he's the fastest man in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Slender and slight at 5 feet 10 and 155 pounds, 27-year-old Tim
Montgomery doesn't look the part of Superman. During a recent visit
to Los Angeles, he walked unnoticed among the joggers and runners who
circled UCLA's Drake Field on a sunny morning.</TE>
<TE>   "People have double-takes looking at me and saying, 'I can't
believe it's you. Tim Montgomery is 6 feet. He's a monster,' " he
said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Anonymity won't last long for Montgomery, who won gold in Sydney
in 2000 for running a first-round heat in the 400 relay.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's goal in Paris was merely to beat Britain's Dwain
Chambers, who became the darling of the European press by defeating
Greene four times this summer. Chambers was the presumed heir to the
sprint supremacy Greene appeared to have lost after a string of
subpar performances. Montgomery, remembering his time of 9.84 last
summer -- which matched what was then the third-best time ever -- and
a string of sub-10-second clockings this season, felt slighted.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was saying, 'No one can go under 9.79. It's impossible,'
" he said. "I say, 'Everyone said flying was impossible, that man
will never fly or go to the moon because they're afraid to take a
chance and afraid of failure.' That's why I talk about the world
record so much because if I don't believe it, no one else is going to
tell me I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   A superb start enabled him to run off with the record and into the
arms of training partner and love interest Marion Jones, nearly
fulfilling two dreams at once.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery, who trains with Jones and coach Trevor Graham in
Raleigh, N.C., had envisioned breaking the record and embracing Jones
afterward at the 50-meter mark. Instead, he broke the record and they
kissed at the finish line, publicly affirming the bond they
solidified by having each other's names tattooed on their arms a
month earlier in Zurich after both won their 100-meter races.</TE>
<TE>   His name is etched on the inside of her arm; her name is imprinted
on his left wrist, beneath his watch. Jones, divorced last year from
shotputter C.J. Hunter, is reluctant to discuss their relationship
and declined an interview request, but Montgomery acted like a
love-struck kid, happy for excuses to say her name aloud.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like marriage. That's like telling all the women, 'Hey,
hey, hey, I'm taken,' " he said of the "Marion" tattoo. "This is who
I want. The friendship is forever, whatever else may happen. The
friendship is there. She has been a great inspiration to me and has
been there every step of the way. It's just like having a friend,
lover and everything all together. You got this perfect spark. You
see us together, you can see we both look greatly happy.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been a great foundation to what I like to call this house
I'm building. I started with the world record, and now it's time to
put the foundation and rest of the house together with the world
championship gold medal and Olympic gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   The world's fastest man is also a well-illustrated man whose left
arm bears the words, "I will fear no evil, for thou art with me,"
from the Bible's 23rd Psalm. "I feel like everybody I race against is
evil and they're against me and I will fear nothing because God is
with me. I won't fear the media. I won't fear anything," he said.
"When I'm out there it's only me.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything can destroy people. Maurice, in the press conference
[after Montgomery set the record] was asked, 'How do you feel now
that they're calling you Slo Mo?' I'm going, 'Gosh, they forgot this
guy gave everything he has to the sport. Please respect him.' And
he's sitting with his head down and said to me, 'Maybe I should have
found another occupation.' I was going to say, 'Maybe you should,'
but I said 'No, you've still got it, c'mon. It's only one year.'</TE>
<TE>   "He can't let the media destroy him. He knows he's got it. A lot
of talent has been lost from people being told they can't do it, or
by arguing with coaches. You've got to stick with what you want to
do. You can't let them get between you and your goal."</TE>
<TE>   And before this year's U.S. championships, where he finished
second to Greene, Montgomery decorated his right arm with an
intricate tattoo of two clenched fists breaking free of shackles,
invoking the Maya Angelou poem "Still I Rise."</TE>
<TE>   On his body and in his life, his faith, philosophy and Jones are
entwined.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been a good role model and help to him," Eddie Montgomery
said. "She's got some pretty good work habits, and he's got some
techniques that can help her, and she's going to break the world
record too."</TE>
<TE>   Tim, who has a 15-month-old daughter from a previous relationship
-- "He met his responsibility and makes good decisions. I'm proud of
him in those areas," Eddie said -- often says he used to live like a
rock star but now lives like a track star. The catalyst for the
transformation was Jones.</TE>
<TE>   They were friends at first, discussing competitive experiences and
running in general. They gradually became closer, and he moved into
her home outside Raleigh.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say when there's snow on the ground, rain on the ground,
I'm thinking it's too cold, I see her get up and get ready to train,
and she's accomplished just about everything you could, except the
world record," he said. "I say to myself, 'What do I have? I've got
to get up.'</TE>
<TE>   "My father and mother always told me the company that you keep is
what you're going to be. If you keep bad company, you're going to end
up bad. Being in good company such as an athlete like Marion is going
to bring out the good side of me."</TE>
<TE>   It brought out the best in him this season. He and Greene had
battled since 1995, with Greene dominating. That Greene didn't run in
Paris, having begged off because of a lack of training time, didn't
spoil the moment for Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   "All year I was like, 'If he's not at his best, I don't want it.'
That was in my mind," Montgomery said. "I was doing the right things,
I was coached the right way. He didn't take pity on me. When I was
coming up and I was trying to make it, he beat me and looked back at
me like, 'There was no competition out here for me.'</TE>
<TE>   "The battlefield and the playing field are equal."</TE>
<TE>   As long as Montgomery has the record, he has the upper hand. His
aim is to cut it to 9.75, the numbers he has had on his car's license
plate the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pressure, but I like pressure. That's why I'm a competitor,"
he said. "Every time I go out there it's pressure. It's like Michael
Jordan said, 'You've got to hate losing more than you love winning.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Another goal is for his younger brother, Jamar, who ran a 10.42 in
the 100 as a sophomore at St. Augustine College, to join him atop the
Olympic medal stand in Athens in two years. He can just see it --
him, his brother, and Jones bringing medals home.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we have a kid, and they win everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And no, that's not an announcement he and Jones are expecting
anything besides records.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what the future may bring," said Montgomery, who
plans to resume training Nov. 1 and then decide whether to compete
indoors. "We're very close and we're just having fun, and any time
you're in a relationship, you look to the future. In our minds, we
feel we're going to be together forever.... We built this thing on
rock, not on sand."</TE>

<HD>Browns' Owner Lerner Dies at 69</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire Al Lerner, who used his wealth from banking, real estate
and credit-card giant MBNA Corp. to buy the Cleveland Browns, died
Wednesday night. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Lerner's death was confirmed by a team spokesman, who asked that
his name not be used.</LD>
<LD>   Lerner had surgery in May 2001, reportedly to remove a brain
tumor. In June, he said he had been in and out of the hospital during
the last year. He was rarely around the Browns' training facility the
last few months.</LD>
<TE>   Lerner ranked 36th on Forbes magazine's 2002 list of the richest
Americans, with a net worth of $4.3 billion. He was awarded
Cleveland's expansion franchise in 1998 for $530 million, at the time
the highest price paid for a sports team.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Lerner magnificently fulfilled the American Dream, with
extraordinary achievement in business and philanthropy," NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. "Tough and considerate at the same
time, his judgment and advice was always special."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis did not practice and was listed by
the Ravens as questionable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh
because of an injured left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, hasn't played since Oct. 6,
when he partially dislocated the shoulder diving for a fumble against
the Browns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami receiver Oronde Gadsden had surgery for ligament damage in
his left wrist and will sit out the rest of the season.... Chicago
end Bryan Robinson has been left off the active roster for Sunday's
game at Minnesota after being arrested for drunk driving Sunday, his
second DUI arrest this year. The Bears did not suspend Robinson and
the league has not taken any action against him.... Minnesota running
back Doug Chapman will sit out the rest of the season because of an
abdominal injury. The Vikings put Chapman on the injured reserve
list, two days after he woke up with internal bleeding.... Kicker
Hayden Epstein signed with the Vikings, one day after he was waived
by Jacksonville. The Vikings released kicker Doug Brien.</TE>

<HD>Lightning Remains Unbeaten With Tie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last season, the Tampa Bay Lightning probably would have folded after
falling behind early in a game.</LD>
<LD>   This season, the Lightning (4-0-2-0) is the only team still
unbeaten in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   Columbus' Geoff Sanderson scored twice in the first period, but
the Lightning rallied for the third time this season to salvage a 2-2
tie Wednesday night at Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<TE>   "Guys believe they can score goals and we can come back on teams,"
said Dave Andreychuk, who had a power-play goal 12 seconds into the
third period to close the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't hurt to have Nikolai Khabibulin in goal. He had 24
saves -- many of them in heavy traffic on shots from the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Sanderson connected on his only two shots of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   He scored an even-strength goal two minutes in, skating from the
corner and sliding the puck between Khabibulin's pads.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great goalie. He's probably one of the best in the league
-- I'm sure he's in the top three or four," Sanderson said. "He
probably would have liked to have that first one back. It was kind of
a weak goal."</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, New York Rangers 1 -- Jaromir Jagr had a goal and an
assist in the second period, and Olaf Kolzig shook off a shot to his
mask to help lift the Capitals at New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals improved to 3-2 on their eight-game trip that began
after an opening-night victory.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Konowalchuk's first goal this season gave the Capitals a 1-0
lead and Jagr scored his fifth on the power play about six minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Barnaby's goal for New York, during a delayed-penalty
call, came 54 seconds after Jagr's score.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Holik caught Kolzig in the mask by his throat when he took a
shot from the right side with 5:38 left in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Kolzig was stunned but managed to keep his focus until play
stopped seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, Atlanta 1 -- Martin Brodeur came within 1.7 seconds
of his first shutout this season.</TE>
<TE>   The host Thrashers have lost their first seven games, managing
only one point with an overtime loss.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Friesen scored for New Jersey in the first period and Scott
Gomez scored in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur had a shutout until Ilya Kovalchuk, playing with a two-man
advantage, scored off a scramble in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Carolina 1 -- Petr Schastlivy scored twice and Patrick
Lalime made 20 saves at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   With the Senators playing their first game in eight days,
Schastlivy scored a power-play goal in the first period. His second
came early in the third period, putting Ottawa ahead, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Bonk and Mike Fisher also scored for the Senators.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Francis scored his fourth this season with 12:12 left to pull
Carolina to within 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   The Senators won their third in a row following a season-opening
loss to New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Toronto 1 -- Olli Jokinen scored twice and had an
assist at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs, booed throughout the third period, have won only
two of eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Luongo made 30 saves for the Panthers, whose two previous
victories came against Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Valeri Bure and Marcus Nilson also scored for Florida.</TE>

<KH>No.15 USC at No.14 OREGON Saturday, Autzen Stadium, 12:30
p.m., Channel 7</KH>
<HD>Fife Is No Lame Duck</HD>
<DH>Junior quarterback has done a solid job replacing
Harrington</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon quarterback Jason Fife knew he would be playing under a long
shadow this season.</LD>
<LD>   So far, though, the task of succeeding Joey Harrington hasn't
caused the junior from Lake Elsinore much distress, even when
Harrington, a rookie with the Detroit Lions, was greeted with
enthusiastic applause by appearing on the sideline before Oregon's
opener at home against Mississippi State.</LD>
<LD>   "I had the mind-set this season I wasn't going to let it bother
me," Fife said. "I wasn't going to let having to step into that
situation get to me."</LD>
<TE>   Anyway, Fife points out there are perks to being around the
Harrington family.</TE>
<TE>   "All of Joey's female cousins came up for my autograph after the
game," he said. "That made it all right."</TE>
<TE>   Fife realizes he isn't going to make Oregon fans forget
Harrington, among the most successful quarterbacks in school history
and a Heisman Trophy finalist last season. But Fife is showing he can
do a competent job.</TE>
<TE>   By playing within his capabilities in a balanced offense, Fife has
helped guide the Ducks to a 6-1 record, 2-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, and a No. 14 ranking entering Saturday's game against No.
15 USC (5-2, 3-1) at Autzen Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 219-pound Fife is ranked second in the nation in
passing efficiency and has earned praise for his steady play from
Coach Mike Bellotti, who says it's difficult to compare Fife with
Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Fife is a different quarterback, and I think the best thing
he's done is not really try to be the next Joey Harrington," Bellotti
said. "He's just trying to be the best Jason Fife. He's the
second-most efficient passer in the nation and that's the best way to
describe Jason in my mind -- as an efficient quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Fife, the former understudy, said he still talks regularly with
Harrington, usually to compare plays on their respective teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk football," Fife said. "We're not really coaching each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Fife already received an on-field education by watching Harrington
lead Oregon to Pac-10 titles the previous two seasons and to a 25-3
record as a starter. Like his predecessor, Fife has demonstrated a
flair for engineering comebacks.</TE>
<TE>   After passing for three touchdowns and running for another in his
first college start, a 36-13 win over Mississippi State, Fife rallied
Oregon to a 28-24 victory over Fresno State by marching the Ducks 43
yards in four plays for the winning touchdown on a two-yard run by
Onterrio Smith with 1:07 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Fife came through again Oct. 12 against UCLA. After scrambling
away from pressure on third down, he found wide receiver Keenan Howry
for a 74-yard scoring pass play in the fourth quarter that held up as
the difference in a 31-30 victory at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In seven games, Fife has completed 109 of 179 passes (60.9%) for
1,614 yards and 15 touchdowns, with only two interceptions. His
quarterback rating of 162.1 is second to Philip Rivers of North
Carolina State (170.8) among Division I players.</TE>
<TE>   Fife's attitude is that he doesn't need to do anything spectacular
to propel a talented Oregon offense that features Smith, the Pac-10's
leading rusher, and receivers Howry, Samie Parker and Jason Willis.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure I'm doing everything possible to help the
team win," said Fife, still upset about the interception he threw on
Oregon's final possession last week in a 45-42 loss to Arizona State.
"I don't want to throw any more [interceptions]. I don't want to make
bad decisions."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll regards Fife as the latest in a long line
of distinguished Duck quarterbacks, a fraternity that includes Norm
Van Brocklin, Dan Fouts, Chris Miller, Bill Musgrave, Danny O'Neil,
Akili Smith and Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   "He's picked up right where Joey left off, so they're really in
good shape," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Fife grew up a UCLA fan in Huntington Beach before moving to Lake
Elsinore, where he attended Temescal Canyon High and helped the
Titans reach the Southern Section Division VIII final as a senior in
1998, losing to Bloomington, 24-22.</TE>
<TE>   He credits Temescal Canyon Coach Bob Burt for helping him develop
as a quarterback. Fife never played organized football before high
school and was a linebacker and receiver on the freshman team.</TE>
<TE>   "My freshman year in high school, I couldn't throw a spiral," he
said. "But I was determined to play quarterback. My sophomore year, I
approached Coach Burt and said, 'Hey, I want to be the JV
quarterback.' "</TE>
<TE>   Through hard work, Fife achieved his goal and became the varsity
starter as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   When UCLA didn't recruit Fife -- the Bruins instead signed
Venice's J.P. Losman, who abruptly left UCLA and transferred to
Tulane -- he chose Oregon, albeit by default. Oregon and California
were both recruiting Kyle Boller of Newhall Hart. When Boller chose
Cal, Oregon offered Fife a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful Boller went to Cal so I could come to Oregon," Fife
said.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't a first choice, but Fife may have the last laugh. A
victory over USC would keep the Ducks in contention for a berth in
the Rose Bowl, something Boller, Losman and USC's Carson Palmer,
another highly recruited quarterback, have never achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Fife acknowledged he will be motivated against the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up a UCLA fan," he said, "so it's that much more incentive
to beat SC."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Makes Surprise Pick in Team Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico named its new national coach Wednesday, and the choice was
something of a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Ricardo Lavolpe, 50, the No. 3 goalkeeper on Argentina's World
Cup-winning team of 1978, was selected over Luiz Felipe Scolari, the
coach who led Brazil to the 2002 World Cup, and Carlos Bianchi, who
coached Boca Juniors of Argentina to two Copa Libertadores titles.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got the human material we need for the national teams to
progress and take first place in the [2004] Olympics, the [2006 World
Cup] qualifiers and the World Cup," Lavolpe told Reuters in Mexico
City.</LD>
<TE>   Lavolpe, who was given a four-year contract, moved to Mexico after
the 1978 World Cup to play for Atlante and later became a Mexican
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   His coaching career began with Oaxtepec in 1983 and he has since
coached Puebla, Atlante, Guadalajara, Queretaro, Club America and
Atlas. He currently is coach of Toluca, which leads the Mexican
league, and is expected to maintain that position until the end of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2010</TE>
<TE>   Africa has been virtually assured of staging the 2010 World Cup
after FIFA, world soccer's governing body, sent letters to all 53
African nations telling them that they have until Dec. 31 to indicate
their interest in hosting the quadrennial world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Countries outside Africa are not being asked to submit bids for
the tournament and FIFA said it will make its decision in May 2004.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa, which was edged out by Germany on a 12-11 vote in
the race to stage the 2006 World Cup, is considered the most likely
2010 host.</TE>
<TE>   Slaton Out for USA</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Slaton, the Carolina Courage player who was the defender
of the year in the Women's United Soccer Assn., left the U.S. women's
national team that will take part in the eight-nation CONCACAF
Women's Gold Cup starting Sunday at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Slaton will have arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage from her
right knee today and will be sidelined for three to four months.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Charge defender Jenny Benson will take Slaton's place
on the roster for the Gold Cup, which serves as a qualifier for the
2003 Women's World Cup in China.</TE>
<TE>   USA Drops Two Places</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's national team dropped from eighth place to 10th
when FIFA released its monthly world rankings in Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   The American team has not played since the World Cup but was
bumped down two notches by England and the Netherlands, which each
rose three places.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil remains the top-ranked team, followed by France, Spain,
Germany, Argentina, England, Mexico, Turkey, the Netherlands and the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Former winners AC Milan, Barcelona and Manchester United became
the first teams to secure their places in the final 16 of the
European Champions League when they each won Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But another former champion, Bayern Munich, stood on the brink of
elimination after its 2-1 defeat by AC Milan in front of 75,611 at
San Siro Stadium in Milan, Italy. Brazilian Serginho gave Milan the
lead, Michael Tarnat tied it for Bayern, which won the trophy in 2001
and has reached the last eight for six years in a row, but Filippo
Inzaghi's goal left the Germans in danger of falling in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona looked out of form in front of 62,000 at Nou Camp
stadium in Barcelona, Spain, but Frank de Boer's 76th-minute goal was
enough to down Lokomotiv Moscow and clinch Barcelona's place in the
next round.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United was given a scare in Greece, but held on to
defeat Olimpiakos, 3-2, and reach the final 16.</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, Newcastle United upset Juventus, 1-0; Club
Brugge defeated Galatasaray, 3-1; Bayer Leverkusen edged Maccabi
Haifa, 2-1; RC Lens surprised Deportivo La Coruna, 3-1, and Dynamo
Kiev shut out Feyenoord, 2-0.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Injured Paus Says Return Is Possible</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cory Paus appreciates the steady stream of cards and e-mails from
well-wishers, but he insisted Wednesday that Bruin followers might
not have seen the last of Cory Paus.</LD>
<LD>   The injured senior quarterback said doctors told him he could
return as soon as the regular-season finale against Washington State
on Dec. 7. And should UCLA qualify for a bowl appearance -- no sure
thing at this point -- Paus believes he would be able to play.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be phenomenal," Paus said. "I'm not going to plan on it.
That way if it doesn't happen it won't be too devastating. But I am
going to stay in shape and do everything I can to be ready."</LD>
<TE>   He will undergo surgery today to have a plate and a screw inserted
into his right fibula, which was broken just above the ankle Saturday
against California.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a non-weight-bearing bone," he said. "The recovery should be
pretty fast."</TE>
<TE>   Paus is able to make it to classes on crutches. He is taking the
last four units toward his degree in history.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm handling this fine," he said. "A friend of mine from Chicago
was in a car accident last Thursday and is in a coma. I've got a
broken ankle. Who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   Paus doesn't know if he'll be able to stand on the sideline
Saturday. But he wants to begin contributing as soon as possible as a
mentor to freshman quarterbacks Matt Moore, Drew Olson and John
Sciarra.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my presence to be positive and upbeat for the team," he
said. "We have three freshman quarterbacks and they didn't plan on
this. I'll be there for them and help any way I can."</TE>
<TE>   As for those cards, letters and e-mails, Paus expressed
appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of those people, I didn't always feel like they were my No.
1 fans," he said. "But everyone has been very kind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moore practiced and the injured Olson did not for the third day in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Although Coach Bob Toledo said a decision hasn't been made on a
starting quarterback, all signs point to Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt seems to be picking up what we're trying to do," Toledo
said. "I'm leaning more and more toward going with Moore."</TE>
<TE>   Moore played only one year at quarterback at Newhall Hart High,
but was successful -- Hart was 13-0 and he passed for 3,334 yards and
33 touchdowns. As a junior he played free safety and had 10
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who has a slightly separated shoulder, did little more than
play catch early in practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Matt Clark will be sidelined because of a broken
toe.... Nate Fikse will kick PATs and field-goal attempts in addition
to his kickoff and punting duties.</TE>

<HD>Trojan Kicker Sounds Off on Crowd Noise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC turned up the piped-in crowd noise to near-deafening levels
Wednesday, giving kicker Ryan Killeen a semblance of what awaits at
Oregon on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Killeen struggled in his last performance before a noisy crowd on
the road. He missed two field-goal attempts and a critical
extra-point attempt in the Trojans' 30-27 overtime defeat at
Washington State on Oct. 5.</LD>
<LD>   He rebounded with two solid performances in home games, making
three of four field-goal attempts and three extra points against
California, and two field-goal attempts and five extra points against
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "I just have to tune it all out," Killeen said of noise produced
by Oregon's fans. "I can't let them get in my head. You don't listen
to it."</TE>
<TE>   Killeen was recruited from Mt. San Antonio College to shore up the
Trojans' weakness on kickoffs. Last year, for example, Oregon took
advantage of short kicks and produced 228 yards in return yardage in
a 24-22 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "My plan is to do what I came here for -- kick the ball out of the
end zone," Killeen said.</TE>
<TE>   Rain is not forecast in Eugene, Ore., on Saturday, but Killeen
kicked wet footballs earlier this week to prepare just in case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worrying about it," he said. "If it happens, it happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer was selected as one of five
semifinalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, presented
annually to the nation's top senior quarterback. Other finalists are
Ken Dorsey of Miami, Byron Leftwich of Marshall, Seneca Wallace of
Iowa State and Dave Ragone of Louisville. The winner will be
announced Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Doyal Butler, who switched from tight end to defensive line
at the end of training camp, moved past walk-on Jay Bottom on the
depth chart and will back up junior defensive end Omar Nazel against
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, 6 feet 3 and 245 pounds, impressed coaches with his speed.
He said he acclimated to the position by observing Nazel and
sophomore Kenechi Udeze.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't run around people," he said. "I watch what Kenechi
does and what Omar does and try to imitate them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers, who missed the Washington game
because of a bruised right knee, practiced and said he is prepared to
start against Oregon. "The way I've been healing the last few days,
I'll be good to go," he said.... Receiver D. Hale practiced for the
first time since injuring his left foot during training camp and
might play against Oregon, Coach Pete Carroll said.... David Davis
did not take part in competitive drills because of soreness in his
right leg. Davis kicks with his left foot.</TE>

<HD>Frustrated S.F. Goes Ape Over Rally Monkey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Pacific Bell Park, San Francisco</DL>
<LD>Pacific Bell Park, San Francisco</LD>
<LD>   Dear Rally Monkey,</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for saving my life.</LD>
<TE>   How, you ask, did you do that?</TE>
<TE>   Well, I know you couldn't make it up here for the three away games
of the World Series this week. I understand your day job barely pays
enough to afford home games.</TE>
<TE>   But, in spirit and image, you are here.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, you're dominating the Series without leaving Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   You've turned Pac Bell Park, the home of the Giants, into a zoo.
There are red monkeys, orange monkeys, black monkeys, white monkeys,
Mexican monkeys, even a monkey dressed as Cinderella. In a 20-minute
pre-game walk through the ballpark, I stopped counting monkey dolls
at 500, and I hadn't reached the upper deck.</TE>
<TE>   Since you're very excitable, please sit down before I tell you one
more thing:</TE>
<TE>   Most of these monkeys have ropes around their necks.</TE>
<TE>   There are monkeys being hung from 2-by-4s, from branches, mop
handles, stadium rails, concession stands and boat masts. One doll of
you was tied to the back of an SUV and dragged through the streets of
the city. Another monkey got itself attached to the rear of a cable
car.</TE>
<TE>   Three men from San Jose -- a caterer, a UPS driver and an
Applebee's server -- have made you into a pinata. They tied your
hands and feet with duct tape and used a noose to attach you to a
long stick. At a spot along McCovey Cove, they are offering free
swings to passersby. One Giant fan brought along his own wooden bat
(a Reggie Sanders model) and hit you so hard you came off the rope!</TE>
<TE>   Not content with public hangings, another Giant fan managed to
smuggle in one of those little guillotines people use to slice
bagels. I last saw him decapitating a monkey doll in the third
inning. To see Pac Bell Park this week, you might think Baz Luhrmann
were remaking "Planet of the Apes" and Dickens' "A Tale of Two
Cities" -- simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   So many Giant fans have torn stuffed monkeys to shreds that they
have their own instructional video:</TE>
<TE>   1. Bite the monkey's head off.</TE>
<TE>   2. Spit it out.</TE>
<TE>   3. Keeping your teeth on the monkey's torso for balance, yank the
left arm off.</TE>
<TE>   4. Repeat and yank off the right arm.</TE>
<TE>   5. Grab the legs and pull them in opposite directions until they
come apart.</TE>
<TE>   6. Soak pieces of monkey in beer. (Optional).</TE>
<TE>   7. Throw monkey pieces in direction of nearest Angel fan.</TE>
<TE>   You're always so upbeat and generous that if you were up here,
you'd probably take this all in stride. You'd point out that fans of
the San Francisco Giants, who have never won a World Series, are
rightfully frustrated. You'd note that the most serious violence done
here has been to Giant pitching. You might suggest that many here are
unsure of their opponent. (When fans started the chorus "Beat L.A.,"
a posse of Angel faithful chanted, "We're Not L.A.!")</TE>
<TE>   Your friends at the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
however, are not so forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be funny if these were stuffed toy babies being torn
apart," declared Debbie Leahy, director of PETA's captive exotic
animal department. "Animal cruelty is a very serious issue, and it's
not something to make light of."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble for Angel fans is that our Giant counterparts don't
limit their nastiness to stuffed monkeys. In the Pac Bell parking
lot, one fan with a monkey in a noose held up a second section of
rope -- the backup noose that apparently all Giant fans keep handy --
and yelled in my direction, "I've got one for you too!"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're so bad," said Terry Diaz, 38, a Giant fan and
courier from Livermore. Only a minute before saying this, he had
reached for my neck and screamed, "Choke the monkey!"</TE>
<TE>   "Consider yourself lucky," he added, "that you're not in Oakland."</TE>
<TE>   And that's when it dawned on me to thank you, my main monkey.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco would be much too dangerous for the visiting Angel
faithful -- without you to beat upon. If Giant fans didn't have all
these monkeys on which to unleash their aggressions, they might turn
their fists on the flesh-and-blood Angel fans.</TE>
<TE>   You're the pillow a guy hits instead of his brother. You're Ali's
rope-a-dope, dressed up in cotton and fake fur.</TE>
<TE>   And the games here are your greatest triumph.</TE>
<TE>   You've gotten into the heads of Giant fans. They are distracted
and consumed by their own hatred.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, they couldn't sustain even one "Let's Go,
Giants" chant. Their homemade signs, instead of boosting their own
players, were all about the violence they wished to visit upon you.
Wrapped up in murderous thoughts, they didn't have enough energy to
wave their orange "Homer Hankie" towels.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, this Series may still be up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   But, metaphorically, you've forced the Giants to play our game.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how many home runs Barry Bonds or Jeff Kent hit, you are
the World Series MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Most valuable primate.</TE>
<TE>   Sincerely,</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mathews</TE>
<TE>   Fellow anthropoid</TE>

<HD>Audit Faults City-Run Bank</HD>
<DH>U.S. says lender, part of riot-recovery effort, may have
improperly spent funds. Study stops short of calling for repayment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An audit by a federal watchdog agency has found that at least $29
million in federal funds may have been spent inappropriately by the
Los Angeles Community Development Bank, created after the 1992 riots
to revitalize poor neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   But the final audit backed away from a draft report that
recommended that Los Angeles -- which oversees the bank and
administers the bulk of its federal funding -- repay as much as $50
million in questionable expenditures from its general fund.</LD>
<LD>   The audit was conducted by the inspector general of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, which provided $435 million to the
bank, the nation's largest community development lending experiment.</LD>
<TE>   The audit, released late last month, comes at a time when the city
has ordered the entity to wind down its operations or become
self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, chairman of the council's Economic
Development and Employment Committee, expressed relief that auditors
did not recommend that the city repay millions of dollars. Launched
in 1996, the bank was plagued in its early years by bad loans, poor
management and lawsuits from former borrowers, and consistently has
fallen short of its mandate to create jobs for residents of the
city's poorest pockets.</TE>
<TE>   The audit found that of 150 businesses that the bank assisted, 101
did not create or retain the required jobs for the low- and
moderate-income residents the bank was designed to help. Only 11% of
the jobs created by those businesses -- rather than the required 51%
-- went to the targeted residents. It also found that $21 million in
loans and investments improperly went to businesses located outside
the targeted "empowerment zone," which includes parts of central,
east and south Los Angeles as well as Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   The audit came down hardest on the bank's venture capital program,
which committed $35 million to risky early-stage investments in
technology companies at the height of the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   Of 14 companies that received investments, 12 did not move into
the empowerment zone as required or create jobs for the residents
they were directed to hire, the audit found. In fact, of 505 jobs
created by the dozen businesses, only 32 went to low- or
moderate-income residents and only four went to empowerment zone
residents. About $29 million of the money has been spent, all of
which auditors said "could be considered a questionable use of HUD
funds."</TE>
<TE>   Bank officials contracted the venture capital program to Zone
Ventures, which the audit also criticized. It recommends that HUD
require the city or the bank to recoup more than $2.6 million in
management fees paid to Zone Ventures. Auditors also found that
imprudent business practices led to about $135,000 in unnecessary
expenses. Garcetti said the city could be on the hook for about
$44,000 of that.</TE>
<TE>   HUD must respond to the inspector general by the end of next month
with a plan for the bank or explain why it believes no corrective
action is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Bank CEO William Chu declined to comment on the audit's specifics,
but said, "HUD, the city, county and the bank disagree [with the
audit]....We will all work together cooperatively to find a
resolution." In comments in the audit, the bank contested all
findings.</TE>
<TE>   Chu has worked to correct the bank's early mistakes since taking
the helm in early 2000. Several lawsuits against the bank have been
settled or dismissed and the only judgment against it is under
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the City Council ordered it to submit a plan to become
self-sufficient or turn operations over to "a third party entity"
within 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The bank has submitted its plan to the city Community Development
Department, and the council is expected to review it by early
December, Chu said.</TE>

<CX>   Community Development Bank -- A headline in Thursday's California
section incorrectly characterized the federally funded Los Angeles
Community Development Bank as "city-run." The bank is an independent,
nonprofit organization. The city and county of Los Angeles oversee
the bank and administer its funds under an agreement with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Since the bulk of the
funding is earmarked for city neighborhoods, the city plays the
largest oversight role, but it does not run the bank.</CX>

<LD>A man who raped a 12-year-old girl in the restroom of a McDonald's
restaurant was sentenced Wednesday to 24 years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge handed down the maximum term for Brandon
Meeks, calling him a predator who has failed to recognize the harm he
caused.</LD>
<LD>   Meeks, 20, of Long Beach did not offer an apology or show any
remorse in his remarks before Judge Joan Comparet-Cassani.</LD>
<TE>   Meeks said he did not know how he "got here in this situation."</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a very bad, tragic experience for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the girl was leaving the women's restroom of a
local McDonald's on Aug. 3, 2001, when Meeks dragged her into the
men's restroom. The restaurant's surveillance camera caught Meeks'
face.</TE>

<LD>Indiana University officials on Wednesday asked law enforcement
authorities to help investigate reports that a Van Nuys maker of
adult films shot one titled "Campus Invasion" at a dorm there.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Sharon Stephens Brehm said university police were asked
to follow up on a report filed Oct. 3 by a dorm resident manager.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint said the resident manager observed several women who
were not fully clothed and also noted that cameras were present.</LD>
<TE>   The university said in a news release that the individuals
involved said they were students from Los Angeles who were working on
a film project.</TE>
<TE>   The film was made at various locations on campus by adult
filmmakers from Shane's World, a Web site based in Van Nuys, said
Calli Cox, a publicist and adult film actress for Shane Enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Brehm said such filming would be inconsistent with the values of

<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the greatest political salesman since
Ronald Reagan, at least in California. We'll know a lot more on
election day when voters decide whether to buy the actor's
after-school ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   One thing for sure: Proposition 49 would not have attracted a
fraction of the attention it has without The Terminator's
sponsorship.</LD>
<TE>   It's tempting to overreach with stretched Reagan-Schwarzenegger
comparisons. Remember, Hollywood's Last Action Hero hasn't won
anything politically yet.</TE>
<TE>   But this much can be said: Reagan and Schwarzenegger have shared
characteristics developed through movie acting. Unlike most
politicians, they hit the campaign trail with instant star quality,
telegenic body language and superb communication skills.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, like Reagan, also is imbued with unshakable
self-confidence and conviction. Plus a disrespect for most
legislators and their operation.</TE>
<TE>   If Prop. 49 passes -- and polls show it ahead -- this will be yet
another symptom of the electorate's distrust of Sacramento
politicians. There's a strong public attitude of "let's just do it
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1978 with voter approval of Prop. 13, the
revolutionary property tax cut. It later included Prop. 98,
guaranteeing 40% of the state general fund for public schools. Then
came legislative term limits. And more.</TE>
<TE>   Although propelled by justifiable voter frustrations, it's a
destructive cycle -- destructive of representative government. The
more the public strips away the power of the Legislature and
governor, the more powerless they are to act.</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem with Prop. 49, a noble cause with an ignoble
means: raiding the state treasury and grabbing money from other
programs, such as health care, parks or law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   (Prop. 51 does the same thing, but there's nothing noble about
that sleazy initiative. Special interests invested in the measure and
hope to be rewarded with self-enriching transportation projects of
dubious benefit to the public.)</TE>
<TE>   Under Prop. 49, up to $550 million automatically -- without
legislative approval -- would be spent each year on before- and
after-school programs. This wouldn't come out of the Prop. 99 school
allotment, but the general fund, the pot that feeds health, safety
and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger says his proposal would be funded from revenue
growth. But other programs also are counting on that growth. So he
should get in line like everybody else, critics contend. It's why we
have a governor and a Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   At least filmmaker Rob Reiner's Prop. 10, four years ago, raised
tobacco taxes to pay for his early childhood development program.</TE>
<TE>   "In a recession you don't raise taxes," Schwarzenegger counters.</TE>
<TE>   "No initiative is perfect.... We can be pickering over this thing
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Pickering? Schwarzenegger slang for nitpicking.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the bigger picture: Get the kids off the streets and into
a safe, supervised educational environment.... If it's up to the
politicians, they'll never vote for it."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, state politicians currently are spending $117 million
annually on after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Arnold has people cowed," says Mary Bergan, president of
the California Federation of Teachers, which opposes Prop. 49. "It's
just bad government.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get to the point where everybody's sequestering funds for
their pet project, we're going to have more funds sequestered then
we've got funds."</TE>
<TE>   The larger California Teachers Assn., however, supports the
measure because it pumps more money into schools.</TE>
<TE>   The California Taxpayers Assn. also backs Prop. 49. "A no-brainer
for taxpayers," says Cal Tax President Larry McCarthy. "This is not a
substantial investment, but it will bring large returns."</TE>
<TE>   Both the teachers and taxpayers groups were bowled over by
Schwarzenegger's presentation of his initiative, insiders say --
impressed by both his passion and command of details.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old Republican moderate invariably is asked about
possibly running for governor in 2006. "The last thing I think about.
You can only do this one step at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger has been promoting after-school programs nationwide
for a decade. And he adds: "There are cynics out there who say this
is a steppingstone. I mean, it's ludicrous. You don't need an
initiative to run for office."</TE>
<TE>   True. But his top advisors once shepherded former Gov. Pete Wilson
-- chief of staff Bob White and political guru George Gorton. And
they certainly see this as a pre-race warmup.</TE>
<TE>   "Been having a great time," says the former Mr. Universe, who once
starred in "The Running Man."</TE>
<TE>   If he keeps running to the Capitol, Schwarzenegger may rue the day
he dreamed up snatching tax money from the governor's control. Reagan
had complete access to the vault.</TE>

<HD>Legislator's Visibility, Foe's Money May Yield Close Race</HD>
<DH>Outspoken conservative faces a multimillionaire in the race
for state controller, a post Democrats have held for the last 28
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>One candidate is a driven career politician without many friends. The
other is a wealthy businessman who is using his own money to help
bankroll his first run for public office. If the race sounds
familiar, it's not. The candidates aren't running for governor; they
want to be state controller -- at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   The politician is not Gov. Gray Davis. Rather, he is one of the
Legislature's most outspoken conservatives, state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), who, like Davis, was first elected to the Assembly
in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   Democrat Steve Westly is the multimillionaire, having made his
fortune in the stock of one of the Silicon Valley's most successful
start-ups, EBay. Unlike Bill Simon Jr., the other wealthy businessman
seeking statewide office, Westly has voted routinely, readily opens
his tax returns to inspection and has deep roots in California
politics.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats have held the post of controller for 28 years. If money
decides elections, Democrats will hold it again. Westly had $3.3
million in cash as of Sept. 30, and is spending $1.3 million a week
on television ads through election day, while McClintock had
$277,000. As legislators go, however, McClintock is well-known. If he
can raise money for TV time, the contest may be the year's most
competitive so-called down-ballot race.</TE>
<TE>   At minimum, it features one of Sacramento's sharper- tongued
characters in McClintock against someone who, though new to most
voters, is mentioned as a future candidate for higher office. Both
are 46, married, have two children and have been politically active
since their college days. Beyond that, they are markedly different,
clashing on philosophy and on how they would approach the duties of
the post they seek.</TE>
<TE>   The controller is probably best known as the official who signs
state checks. He or she also can refuse to sign checks, to the dismay
of governors. Outgoing Controller Kathleen Connell incurred Davis'
wrath, for example, by moving to block an $88.5-million payment in
2000 to attorneys in a lawsuit settled by the administration, and by
refusing to pay a $910 bill for Japanese food ordered by state
electricity buyers during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Given that past controllers have made their names by clashing with
governors, both this year's candidates are running in part against
the unpopular governor, accusing him and the Legislature of allowing
government to grow too fast and fueling the $24-billion deficit that
budget negotiators faced earlier this year. McClintock accuses Davis
of being "one of the most incompetent and corrupt individuals who
ever served in that office."</TE>
<TE>   Among the darts McClintock flings Westly's way: Westly has
described himself as being part of Davis' team. From 1999 to 2001,
Westly donated $36,350 to Davis' reelection effort, though he gave
the governor no money in 2002. Westly says he would be bipartisan and
scoffs at the notion that he is a Davis sycophant.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray endorsed my primary opponent," Westly says of State Board of
Equalization member Johan Klehs. "I have no difficulty saying [Davis]
was way too slow in responding to the energy crisis.... I view myself
as completely independent. He doesn't view me as part of his team."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serving as a fiscal watchdog by auditing state
spending, the controller sits on 50 boards, including the Franchise
Tax Board and Board of Equalization, which oversee state tax
collections and policy, and the State Lands Commission, which has
oversight of offshore oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing on McClintock's votes against environmentalist-backed
bills, Westly says his foe favors more offshore drilling. McClintock
denies it.</TE>
<TE>   "Shutting down existing wells would drive the price through the
roof," the senator said. "I do not believe [offshore drilling] should
be shut down. I don't believe it should be expanded."</TE>
<TE>   Controllers sit on boards that govern the massive California
Public Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers' Retirement
System. Past controllers cast votes on whether to sell off tobacco
stocks and holdings in apartheid-era South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock opposes using the funds for social ends, saying
decisions should be based on rate of return and whether the
investment is solid. Westly advocates using the funds to become
"major figures on a national stage" to help bring about corporate
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a political science degree from UCLA, McClintock
got his start in politics by working for former state Sen. Ed Davis.
McClintock won an Assembly seat at age 26, lost a run for Congress
and failed in a run for controller in 1994, falling to Connell by
fewer than 170,000 votes out of nearly 7.5 million cast. He returned
to the Assembly in 1996 and won his state Senate seat in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock has forged a reputation as a maverick within the GOP,
if not a loner. He was among the harshest critics of Republican Chuck
Quackenbush, who resigned as state insurance commissioner amid
scandal in 2000. McClintock regularly attacked spending proposals by
Republican Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson. The former
governors endorsed his primary foe, Board of Equalization member Dean
Andal.</TE>
<TE>   Westly, a Stanford graduate, started out working for the late Rep.
Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo), who was assassinated in 1978 while
investigating the People's Temple cult in Guyana. Westly later
received a master's in business administration from Stanford, worked
in a variety of businesses and government posts, and stayed involved
in Democratic politics. Described in a 1989 newspaper story as a
"mop-topped, 32-year-old investment banker," Westly challenged former
Gov. Jerry Brown to become state Democratic Party chairman and lost,
having been outspent 3 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Westly joined the upstart Internet auction firm EBay in 1997, back
when it had 23 employees. EBay stock made him a wealthy man. Although
he is not obligated to release his tax returns, Westly opened the
last three years' documents.</TE>
<TE>   By doing so, he undercut a potential issue for McClintock.
Westly's returns show that he had adjusted gross income of $13.6
million in 2001, $63.3 million in 2000, the year he left EBay to
embark on his campaign, and $40.6 million in 1999. He paid almost $33
million in state and federal income taxes during those three years.
He and his wife also created a family foundation and made $6.6
million in charitable donations.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's tax returns show that he and his wife make ends meet
on a public official's salary, with $114,600 in adjusted gross
income. McClintock prepares his own tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Westly has spent $5.3 million on his campaign and tapped donors
for an additional $5 million. Public employee unions are among his
biggest donors. The California State Employees Assn. gave him
$100,000; the California Teachers Assn. donated $131,000; and the
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., which represents state
prison guards, contributed $35,000.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock was the only lawmaker this year who voted against
granting a pay increase of as much as 37% to prison officers, spread
over the next five years. Westly said he is not bothered by the
raise, adding: "These guys have the toughest job in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Westly and McClintock say they oppose new taxes. Both say
government has grown too fast. But among their many differences,
McClintock opposes the school construction and low-income housing
bonds on the Nov. 5 ballot, and will oppose a $9.9-billion bond
measure on the 2004 ballot to build a bullet train. Westly supports
each measure.</TE>
<TE>   Westly favors abortion rights; McClintock opposes abortion and
state funding of abortions for poor women. He criticizes Westly for
saying early in the campaign that he would block government payments
to hospitals that fail to provide abortions. Westly has since backed
off that statement.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's status as an outsider, albeit one who has spent 20
years in and around elective office, is reflected in who has not
donated to his campaign. He has received no money from moneyed
interests with a stake in state issues, other than a combined $4,000
from tobacco giants Philip Morris U.S.A. and R.J. Reynolds, and a
modest $27,000 from three Indian tribes that operate casinos.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's biggest donors are conservative financiers, including
Howard Ahmanson Jr., the Orange County heir to the Home Savings &amp;
Loan fortune, who has helped bankroll many conservative candidates
during the last decade. Ahmanson gave McClintock $80,000. Nonunion
contractors also have been significant donors.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock shrugs off the lack of money from Sacramento insiders.
Public employees and others who depend on California's $99-billion
budget are part of the "spending lobby," he says. And as he sees it:
"I ask questions they don't want asked, let alone have answered."</TE>

<HD>MTA's Unique Traffic Plan</HD>
<DH>The transit agency is considering use of surface streets to
link the Harbor Freeway carpool lanes with the El Monte Busway
downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transportation officials are considering adding carpool lanes along
surface streets through downtown Los Angeles and sections of skid row
to close a three-mile gap between two crowded freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents of the plan say it is much cheaper to use city streets
to connect the carpool lanes on the Harbor Freeway Transitway and the
El Monte Busway on the San Bernardino Freeway than to close the gap
by building new carpool lanes on the existing freeways.</LD>
<LD>   To add carpool lanes on the two freeways would require widening or
adding a second deck to the roadways, at a cost of nearly $1 billion.
By comparison, linking the two sections along city streets would cost
less than $6 million, planners say.</LD>
<TE>   But the proposal by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has
generated strong opposition from downtown residents, lawmakers and
business owners who fear the carpool lanes would ruin efforts to
transform downtown into a pedestrian-friendly shopping and
residential district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous to run that thing through downtown when it's just
starting to come to life," said Douglas Wance, a lawyer who lives in
a downtown loft on Spring Street.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA has yet to decide on a route for the proposed lanes.
Nearly a dozen streets are under consideration. For the north-south
segment of the route, the possibilities include San Pedro, Alameda
and Main streets and Central Avenue. For the east-west segment,
proposed routes include 4th Street, Adams and Martin Luther King Jr.
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   MTA planners hope to narrow the alternatives to two or three
before presenting the idea to the MTA board in February. A final
decision is expected in April.</TE>
<TE>   Planners say a connection between the El Monte Busway and the
Harbor Freeway Transitway would ease the bottlenecks at the
culmination of the two carpool-lane segments and improve traffic flow
through downtown. The two carpool lane segments are heavily used, but
transportation officials say the gridlock where they end
significantly reduces the potential time savings and may discourage
drivers from using the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The El Monte Busway carries 1,047 vehicles per hour per lane, with
a minimum of three people per vehicle, according to a recent MTA
study. The Harbor Freeway Transitway carries 1,336 vehicles per hour
per lane, with a minimum of two people per car.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA plan includes several alternatives for building carpool
lanes along surface streets, but MTA officials say the most likely
option would be to create two new lanes -- one in each direction --
by re-striping existing surface street lanes. To make room for the
new lanes, parking on those streets probably would be eliminated or
restricted. The cars and buses that use the lanes would have to abide
by existing speed limits, but the traffic lights along the route
might be adjusted to move carpool traffic more quickly through
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is not completely new. The Harbor Freeway Transitway
now connects with a surface street carpool lane that runs north from
Adams Boulevard along Figueroa Street for about two miles. But that
lane abruptly ends at Figueroa and 5th Street, about a mile and a
half from the El Monte Busway.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities, including Seattle, New York and Alexandria, Va.,
also are testing carpool lanes on surface streets.</TE>
<TE>   But when MTA officials unveiled the idea to downtown residents and
business owners at a meeting last month, it was not well received.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Burrow, a downtown resident and founder of the Historic
Downtown Community Assn., said he came away from the meeting thinking
that a set of carpool lanes is the last thing his downtown
neighborhood needs.</TE>
<TE>   "This seems to be a step backward in our efforts to make downtown
a more pedestrian-friendly area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown business groups fear the carpool lane project would be a
setback for a burgeoning effort to turn the area into a lively
cultural, commercial and residential center.</TE>
<TE>   The new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Staples Center and
the soon to be completed Walt Disney Concert Hall are expected to
help create that vision by attracting many more visitors downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider this a new downtown with a new set of priorities,"
said Carol Schatz, president and chief executive of the Central City
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Los Angeles has indeed changed, with new condominiums,
apartments and lofts opening in Bunker Hill, South Park, Central City
East and other neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, downtown Los Angeles had about 12,000 homes and
apartments. Today, downtown has nearly 14,000 housing units, with
nearly 7,000 more units under design or construction, according to
the Central City Assn. That represents nearly 20,000 residents,
outside the single-room hotel tenants in skid row.</TE>
<TE>   To help create the pedestrian-friendly atmosphere, Schatz and
downtown homeowner groups are pressing Los Angeles city
transportation officials to reduce traffic speeds, convert one-way
streets to two-way streets and add more street parking.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we are trying to create an atmosphere that has a
village feel," said Nathan Johnston, a downtown resident who attended
the MTA meeting and opposes the carpool lane plan.</TE>
<TE>   While Johnston, Schatz and others campaign to slow downtown
traffic, transportation engineers are struggling to come up with ways
to improve traffic flow, particularly through downtown, where four of
the state's busiest freeways converge.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown traffic has worsened, in part, because motorists trying
to avoid freeway congestion have increasingly cut through large city
streets, turning wide boulevards into mini-freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of connecting the carpool lanes on the El Monte Busway
and the Harbor Freeway Transitway has been under study since even
before the transitway was completed in 1996. The transitway runs for
nearly 11 miles, from the Artesia Freeway (California 91) to Adams
Boulevard, just south of the Santa Monica Freeway. For the final 2.6
miles, just before Adams Boulevard, the elevated lanes extend 50 feet
above the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The El Monte Busway, stretching for 11 miles from the city of El
Monte to Alameda Street near downtown's Union Station, opened in
1973. Most carpool lanes require two or more passengers per vehicle
but, because of the heavy demand along the San Bernardino Freeway,
the El Monte Busway requires a minimum of three passengers per
vehicle during peak hours.</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 study commissioned by the MTA and the California Department
of Transportation concluded that connecting the transitway and the
busway would improve the access of buses and carpools to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   But the study said that extending the transitway north along the
Harbor Freeway to the four-level interchange and then east along the
101 Freeway to the El Monte Busway would cost about $932 million.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the study said that connecting the two carpool lane
segments along surface streets would cost less than $6 million.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Urges Elected Officials Be Removed From Film Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Wednesday that he supports
removing himself and all other elected officials from the board of
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp., the film permitting
agency under investigation by county prosecutors for possible misuse
of public funds.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he agrees with a recent recommendation by City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo, who argued that removing elected officials from the
board would help clear up confusion about whether it is a private or
public agency. All members of the City Council and the county Board
of Supervisors automatically serve on the EIDC board.</LD>
<LD>   The agency was set up in 1995 by the city and county as an
experiment in privatizing public services, in this case the
processing of permits for location filming, which previously had been
handled by government.</LD>
<TE>   Delgadillo said in an Oct. 10 report that the intent was for the
EIDC to be a private, nonprofit agency that would contract with the
city and county and pass through permit and film service revenue to
the government agencies. But one of the issues being investigated by
the district attorney's office is whether the money handled by the
agency constitutes public funds, in which case it could not be used
for political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 20 members of the council and the county board who have
served on the EIDC board have received campaign contributions from
the agency over the years. "The recommendation of the city attorney
was a good one," said Hahn, who as mayor is a member of the EIDC
board. "None of the elected officials had any impact or influence on
those contributions, but I think ... it does not look right."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who received campaign contributions from the agency during
his mayoral campaign, made his comments Wednesday on his regular
radio call-in show on KFWB-AM (980) just a day after the Los Angeles
City Council allocated $150,000 to audit the agency.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to questions raised by prosecutors over the agency's
campaign contributions and the expense-account spending of the
agency's president, the city is concerned that it may not have been
fully reimbursed by the agency in a timely fashion for city services
used during location filming.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor Wednesday challenged the practice of having elected
officials automatically serve on the EIDC board with film industry
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to have an appointed board," Hahn said. "That
makes the EIDC much more effective."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did not elaborate on how such a change would improve
public oversight of the embattled agency. A spokeswoman for Hahn said
later that because many of the elected officials on the board do not
attend the board's meetings, there would be better oversight with a
smaller appointed panel. The mayor and council members could still
monitor the agency to make sure it complied with its city contract,
said Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than resign immediately from the board, Wong said, the
mayor will wait for a comprehensive package of changes being
developed by a consultant for the agency. Hahn recently returned
$25,000 in contributions that the agency made to the mayor's
anti-secession campaign, saying it was a distraction from the issues
involving the proposed city breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Taking aim at another troubled agency, Hahn said Wednesday that he
wants reforms at the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, which
a city audit faulted last week for lavish spending and poor
performance.</TE>
<TE>   In his strongest statements yet on the nonprofit city contractor's
problems, Hahn said that its management needs to be revamped and that
officials need to be more aggressive about bringing business to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said George Kirkland, the convention bureau president who has
been the target of much criticism, needs to show that he can better
manage the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should have a lock on any job. They've got to perform,"
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mr. Kirkland certainly has gotten a lot of criticism. The
board has asked him to make some changes; we'll see if he can do that
and revitalize the bureau," Hahn said on the radio program "Ask the
Mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn strongly suggested that the convention bureau must bring more
shows to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "When Des Moines, Iowa, gets more conventions than Los Angeles, I
think we have to look at that," Hahn said. "I think [the bureau's]
performance has been underwhelming at best."</TE>

<HD>Simon Takes Chance With Pete Wilson Endorsement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a move fraught with political cross-currents, Republican
gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. won the public support Wednesday
of former Gov. Pete Wilson, who praised Simon's leadership and
accused his own successor, Gray Davis, of turning the state's
finances into a disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Simon "will attack with energy the problems that need solving
because California's future is in doubt," Wilson told reporters,
before attending a small fund-raiser with the GOP candidate at an
upscale hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "I happen to be a little proud of the fact that we left this state
in pretty good shape four years ago," he said. "It is not in as good
shape today."</LD>
<TE>   Simon's first public appearance with the former governor, just 13
days before the election, was designed to spark enthusiasm among
Republicans who feel continued loyalty to Wilson, a two-term governor
and U.S. senator. But the presence of Wilson -- a polarizing figure
who backed a controversial 1994 initiative that would have eliminated
health and education benefits for illegal immigrants -- could
alienate the Latino voters Simon is trying win over, political
experts said. Proposition 187 was approved by voters, but largely
overturned by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, it will be seen as a slap in the face," said Jaime
Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public
Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For many, Wilson remains a potent symbol of the party's
anti-immigrant image in the state. His support for Proposition 187
galvanized thousands of Latinos to register to vote in the years that
followed. Three-quarters signed up as Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Vizcaya Hotel where the two men attended a
fund-raiser, half a dozen protesters from the United Farm Workers
shouted "Pete Wilson, go home!" and carried signs that said
"Simon-Wilson Prop. 187 Team."</TE>
<TE>   Simon called Wilson "a very good friend" and "a great public
servant," and dismissed suggestions that Wilson's assistance in the
campaign would upset Latino voters. The GOP candidate -- who has said
he was opposed to Proposition 187 -- argued that he has aggressively
campaigned for Latino votes by emphasizing the need for more jobs and
better schools.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk to members of the Latino community, my message
resonates with them," said Simon, who visited an elementary school in
south Sacramento Wednesday morning, where he promised to improve
public schools and create more charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said Simon's embrace of
the former governor will backfire. He noted that George W. Bush
avoided appearing with Wilson during multiple visits to California in
the 2000 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   "Pete Wilson has been a very divisive figure, especially among
Latinos in California, and I'm not sure that they'll appreciate
this," Salazar said. "You can go into any Latino crowd and say, 'Pete
Wilson,' and all you hear are boos."</TE>
<TE>   University of California Regent Ward Connerly, who attended the
Simon fund-raiser Wednesday, said Wilson has been unfairly tarnished
by the fallout over Proposition 187. But he agreed that the
initiative and the governor's ardent support for it created a public
relations problem for the state GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's made it appear that the Republican Party is
anti-Hispanic," said Connerly, who became a lightning rod for racial
politics after mounting efforts to kill affirmative action programs
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's appearance with Wilson -- despite the risks to his Latino
appeal -- indicates that his campaign's main focus is turning out
Republicans, political consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, that segment of the vote is taking precedence to
anything the campaign has done in the Hispanic community," said GOP
consultant Mike Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   'Sleight of Hand'</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in the lush hotel patio, Wilson accused Davis of ruining
the state's fiscal health with the recently passed budget.</TE>
<TE>   "What you've seen is in order to get by an election without
offending voters, the governor and a Democratic majority in the
Legislature have engaged in this sleight of hand," said Wilson, who
like Davis confronted a painful multibillion-dollar deficit in his
first term. "This is not a budget, it's a sham."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said Wilson was ill-informed about the state's finances.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at this stage of the campaign, Pete Wilson is about as
relevant as Bill Simon, and that's not saying much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon released a television commercial charging
Davis with bungling the state's energy crisis and budget. In the ad,
which the campaign said is running statewide, Simon addresses the
camera and tells voters that Davis has cost taxpayers $11 billion for
new schools, police officers and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've had enough, I'm asking for your vote," the Republican
nominee says in the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar called the ad misleading. He noted that money spent on
buying electricity during the energy crisis was not taken from the
state's general fund, and will be repaid with bonds. In addition, he
said, schools are built with bond money, and so school construction
has not been curtailed by budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a fundamental misunderstanding of how the state budget
works," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial comes less than two weeks after Simon said he would
try to elevate the rhetoric of the campaign and move away from
negative attacks. Since then, he has run only anti-Davis ads.</TE>
<TE>   The reappearance of Wilson, who has maintained a low political
profile since leaving office in 1999, sparked a series of charged
remarks from several parties.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the hotel where Simon held the fund-raiser, California
Democratic Party advisor Bob Mulholland stood with the protesters and
lashed at Simon for associating himself with the former governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Wilson's anti-Latino tattoo today goes on Simon's arm,"
Mulholland said. "Big mistake by Simon, to associate himself with the
leading immigrant-bashing Republican in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Wilson was asked how he felt about being dogged by
protesters eight years after the controversial anti-illegal
immigration initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-Raising Criticized</TE>
<TE>   "I miss it; I felt right at home," he said. "Except I
felt inclined to stop and tell 'em that this wasn't the unemployment
line."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Connerly jumped into the fray, taking on Davis' prolific
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has given sleaze a bad name," the regent said.</TE>
<TE>   He also had a candid appraisal of Simon's campaign, which has been
beset with problems since the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign has not been a classic good campaign," Connerly
said. But Simon is "a very decent man, and he loves this state and he
wants to make a difference."</TE>

<HD>Health Care Not on Race's Radar</HD>
<DH>Candidates for governor ignore the financial crisis. But
analysts warn the winner is in for a nasty surprise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financial squeeze on health care in California, which threatens
the viability of public hospitals, trauma care and emergency rooms,
is largely being ignored in the state's top political race.</LD>
<LD>   But health experts and political scientists said the next governor
is in for a rude awakening next year.</LD>
<LD>   Among the grim realities in health care: Los Angeles County, faced
with a massive budget deficit in its health department, may have to
shutter two public hospitals to cut costs.</LD>
<TE>   Other hospitals are closing ERs because of cost constraints,
shifting the burden to neighboring hospitals that are already
overworked.</TE>
<TE>   The number of uninsured patients appears to be growing statewide
as insurance premiums for the middle class are rising.</TE>
<TE>   And faced with another multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, the
state may be forced to radically curtail health services to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like an illness, you keep putting [treatment] off,
and it's only going to get worse," said Lark Galloway-Gilliam,
executive director of Community Health Councils Inc., which attempts
to vocalize neighborhood health needs. "Nobody wants to talk about it
because nobody has easy answers, and they're only looking at short
term. We're really witnessing kind of a meltdown here."</TE>
<TE>   In his newest campaign commercials, Gov. Gray Davis boasts of
providing public health insurance to 1 million children from
low-income families during his four-year term, and of helping 45,000
consumers challenge their HMOs on everything from denied treatments
to billing errors.</TE>
<TE>   But when he describes what he hopes to address in his second term,
he mentions schools, the environment, the economy and energy. Health
care isn't on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. does not list
health care, which comprises more than a third of the state's total
budget, among his top three priorities. His "Blueprint to Renew the
California Dream" spotlights education, fiscal responsibility and the
state's infrastructure, such as transportation, water and energy.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes the top five of every [election] poll I've ever seen of
issues, and then the question is: Why doesn't it make it into the
debates or the TV ads, other than a one-line mention in some bland
line of accomplishments?" said Bruce Cain, a professor of political
science at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Cain attributed the apparent disconnect to the complexity of the
issue and the powerlessness of the uninsured -- many of whom are poor
and do not vote.</TE>
<TE>   More Attention</TE>
<TE>   "In health care ... there are so many people who can potentially
be blamed for the breakdown of the system that you don't assume it's
the governor," Cain said. "You can always say the feds are
responsible, or it's up to insurance companies or private
enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a Democrat,
agreed that no one wants to be blamed. "I think everyone is just
embarrassed by the whole thing and doesn't want to talk about it,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has served on the board of Childrens Hospital of Los
Angeles, agreed that health care deserves more attention.</TE>
<TE>   "You see the 11 clinics in Los Angeles that need to be shut down.
You've got trauma centers in California that are insolvent. You've
got doctors who are reluctant to accept Medi-Cal because of the
reimbursement rates," Simon said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not ... somebody howling at the moon. This is a bona-fide
crisis that is swirling, and unless we start to do things to nip it
in the bud, it's only going to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has called for tax deductions for doctors who perform
charity care and for allowing private businesses to purchase health
insurance through the state's Healthy Families program. That program
for working poor families provides $2 in federal money for every $1
the state spends.</TE>
<TE>   Still, La Prell Johnson, 62, said she is discouraged that health
care hasn't taken a higher profile in the campaign. Johnson's health
clinic was one of the 11 closed by Los Angeles County this fall in
the first phase of cost-cutting. When she went to a different clinic
earlier this month, she waited eight hours to see a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "People are so frustrated because of the long waits," said
Johnson, who has high blood pressure, arthritis, a pinched nerve in
her back, a thyroid condition and kidney problems. "They're ill.
They're in pain. It's just so terrible. I think they [politicians]
know about it, but I think they mostly ignore it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked in an interview why he didn't spend more time discussing the
looming problems in health care, Davis said he preferred mentioning
his accomplishments. "I like to speak to something that immediately
resonates with folks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until this month, Davis had rebuffed requests from Los Angeles
County supervisors for a meeting on health issues. As the
supervisors, faced with a health-care deficit of $500 million to $750
million in three years, steamed toward a vote on closing hospitals,
they became increasingly critical of what they saw as the governor's
inattentiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The sharpest critics were fellow Democrats: Gloria Molina and Zev
Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is going to be the governor for the next four years, he has
to be responsible to all of us on this matter," Molina said last
month.</TE>
<TE>   It was after that sort of remarks that Davis agreed to meet with
Molina and board Chairman Yaroslavsky. Afterward, he said he was open
to calling a special session of the Legislature on health care in
January, as the supervisors requested.</TE>
<TE>   Since the meeting, the Democratic supervisors have reined in their
critiques of the governor. "The governor has made a commitment to not
leave us standing alone," said Molina's spokesman, Miguel Santana.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said his staff has worked with the county for several months
to seek additional funding from Washington that could head off
hospital closures.</TE>
<TE>   "I get blamed for athlete's foot and for the drought," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly don't want to put anyone down that blames me," he
said. "I think they would agree that we're now on a constructive path
and all pulling in the same direction."</TE>
<TE>   Because the state budget protects other programs -- including
education -- from year-to-year budget swings, some experts said it is
inevitable that health care will be among the first programs to be
cut if, as predicted, the state faces a large deficit next year.</TE>
<TE>   Both Simon and Davis said they want to see the specifics of next
year's budget deficit before saying whether health cuts are needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than automatically say we've got to limit the scope of
coverage, why don't we take a look at whether there's existing waste
and mismanagement in the system?" Simon said. "There's so much money
sloshing around in the system."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Rosenstock, dean of the UCLA School of Public Health, said
cuts to health care are coming "unless the economy does something
rather impressive in this year coming up, which does not look
likely.... I don't see any way it's not vulnerable if we're not
willing to increase revenues."</TE>
<TE>   'Budget Crisis'</TE>
<TE>   Simon has knocked Davis because California was forced to
relinquish its claim to about $740 million in federal funding for
children's health insurance because California didn't spend the money
-- which required matching dollars from the state -- within a
three-year time limit.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about a budget crisis," he said. "My golly, our state
government left on the table in Washington over $700 million, and
it's a shame."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said his administration increased the number of children in
the Healthy Families program from 50,000 at the beginning of his term
to more than 600,000. He has lobbied Congress to give the state more
time to spend the money.</TE>
<TE>   About 6.2 million people in California, or 21% of the non-elderly
population, lacked health insurance at some point in 2001, a UCLA
study shows. Though the number of uninsured has declined in recent
years, experts say the current economic downturn may have erased
those improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, studies have shown that health insurance premiums will
increase 12% to 15% next year, nearly the same rate of inflation that
spurred the growth of managed care in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Joan Moxley-Brown, 62, who lives in Lakeview Terrace is
left to worry about where her medical care will come from.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley-Brown, a retired systems analyst for medical facilities who
lacks private insurance, has high blood pressure, diabetes and renal
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Her local community clinic, Tujunga Health Center, closed and her
most convenient alternative, Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, is on
the chopping block too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious that the things that are important to the citizens
of this country are not as important to the people who are in
charge," Moxley-Brown commented.</TE>

nightmares.</LD>
<LD>   The windows were so poorly installed and constructed that they
permanently fogged up and obscured the view, residents say. The walls
cracked and grew stained from water damage, and dry rot lurked behind
wallpaper and paint. Thousands of missing clamps and beam connectors
exposed them to earthquake dangers, they contend.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, an Orange County jury awarded residents $1 million
-- the latest piece in a series of settlements and judgments they
have received over the last four years that total $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the group of 123 homeowners said the money will cover only
half of the estimated cost of repairs. Lawyers representing the group
will ask Orange County Superior Court Judge Raymond Ikola next month
to increase the award.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make you feel too good," said John Wilbert, a
66-year-old retiree who moved into the development with his late wife
12 years ago. "When you consider all the people involved, a million
dollars is not that much today."</TE>
<TE>   Wilbert said the first sign of trouble came when the clear windows
in his home grew gradually more clouded several years after he bought
the house. "It's kind of embarrassing. You don't want people to see
your windows, because they'll think they're dirty."</TE>
<TE>   Then, more serious problems developed, homeowners, said, such as
water damage to walls that needed to be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   For Wilbert and others, the deterioration came as a shock because
they paid a premium for what they thought was going to be top-level
craftsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, argued at trial for 14 weeks, named the window
manufacturer, Weather Shield of Wisconsin, and a defunct
subcontractor, Darro the Framing Company, as defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners charged that Weather Shield improperly manufactured its
double-pane windows, leaving them vulnerable to moisture damage and
fogging. The jury, however, did not award damages for the fogged
windows, and limited damages to the work of the building framers.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Clayton Anderson told jurors that to cut expenses,
framers skimped on materials. Specifically, he said the company left
out thousands of metal clips that are used to join wooden walls to
roofs and foundations. The contractor also allegedly failed to
install critical stabilizing straps and wall supports and neglected
to install flashing, or water barriers, on the bottoms of window
sills.</TE>
<TE>   "They cut corners and made mistakes along the way," said the
plaintiffs' co-counsel, Thomas Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the window manufacturing firm and the framer did not
comment on the verdict, reached Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the residents are either retirees or nearing retirement
and had purchased the homes after trading up from smaller homes
purchased years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This home was a step up for us and it was a stretch to buy here,"
said Dave McNeely, 53. McNeely said he and his wife tried to hide
cracked walls, stains and fogged windows with curtains. "I didn't
want anyone to think we didn't take care of our property."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, residents named the developer, J.M. Peters Development,
as a defendant in the suit. Peters, however, settled with the group,
along with other contractors, and ultimately joined the homeowners in
the suit against the framer and window manufacturer.</TE>

<HD>New Airport Screeners Quicken Pace</HD>
<DH>After a slow start, federal employees at John Wayne have
improved operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a rocky start plagued by equipment malfunctions and long lines
for John Wayne Airport passengers, federal baggage screeners have
improved operations since assuming responsibility for security more
than a week ago, airport officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, authorities still advise travelers to arrive two
hours before departure to ensure they get through check-in procedures
and security screening in plenty of time to make their flights.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are getting better and better; every day the process is
becoming faster," airport spokeswoman Ann McCarley said. "But we
cannot guarantee that the terminals will not be crowded."</LD>
<TE>   About 150 screeners hired by the Transportation Security
Administration reported for work Oct. 16 at passenger checkpoints in
the airport's terminals. They replaced a private security company
that had handled screening for the 7.8 million passengers that
annually pass through Orange County's only commercial airfield.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta inaugurated the
change, saying the more thoroughly trained screeners would provide
"world-class security and world-class service" to airline passengers.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 17, a computer malfunction at a baggage X-ray machine,
inexperienced workers and a busy travel day combined to create long
delays for passengers at screening areas between 7:30 and 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people jammed the terminals and stood in lines that
snaked through the check-in areas and walkways. Some flights were
delayed or took off half-filled because travelers had to wait an hour
or more to get through security.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said the computer glitch took about five hours
to fix. The situation was exacerbated, they said, because the 150
screeners were beginning 60 hours of required on-the-job training.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like anyone else during their first day on the job," said
Dave Steigman, a spokesman for the federal security agency. "Things
are going much smoother. We have not had any formal complaints to our
customer-service unit."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials plan to take over security at the nation's 429
airports that provide scheduled service. So far, they have assigned
screeners to 190 facilities. At John Wayne Airport, the security
administration wants to place an additional 40 or so workers and
install a high-tech device to check for explosives by December.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, John Wayne Airport has
steadily recovered from a dramatic decline in air travel. Over the
past six months, passenger volumes have been slightly ahead of last
year's for the same time period.</TE>
<TE>   As airports have returned to more normal operations, federal and
airport officials say many passengers no longer are arriving early to
make their flights. They recommend that travelers get to the airport
1 1/2 to 2 hours before departure.</TE>
<TE>   "People have resorted to getting to the airport at the last
minute," Steigman said. "You should get there as early as you can
because we are going to be painstaking in our inspections."</TE>

<HD>State Opens Investigation of Private Hospital</HD>
<DH>On-site review could determine future federal funding in
wake of sexual abuse cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prompted by allegations of patient sexual abuse and the conviction of
former hospital workers on molestation charges, state health
officials this week launched a broad investigation to determine if
Pine Grove Hospital is fit to receive federal health-care funds.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Health Services began an on-site
review Monday of the private West Hills psychiatric hospital.
Investigators began poring over medical and employment records,
interviewing employees and patients, and scrutinizing hospital
regulations, said Brenda Klutz, deputy director of licensing and
certification for the state health department.</LD>
<LD>   By week's end, the results will be forwarded to the federal
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administer a number
of big-ticket federal health programs. The hospital could face a
number of sanctions, from stricter state monitoring to a ban on
federal welfare payments, Klutz said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really an in-depth review to see if they have appropriate
systems in place to prevent, detect and correct problems," Klutz
said. "If they don't have appropriate safeguards in place, then it
could affect their certification status for getting Medicaid and
Medicare reimbursements."</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove Administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment on
the investigation Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital already was the subject of a review by the Los
Angeles County Mental Health Department, which began an investigation
after an August incident involving a 13-year-old patient. A
17-year-old boy, also a patient, pleaded guilty to one count of a
lewd act with a child. State officials later cited the hospital for
failing to monitor a hallway, state documents show.</TE>
<TE>   State and local health officials also are scrutinizing four
incidents in 2000 in which former Pine Grove workers were accused of
sexually molesting patients and former patients, three of them
underage girls.</TE>
<TE>   Four Pine Grove employees were investigated by local law
enforcement authorities. Prosecutors declined to file charges against
two of the men, but two others -- counselor Angel Vargas and mental
health worker Quincy Crawford -- are currently serving time.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, 38, is serving a four-month sentence in Los Angeles County
Jail after pleading guilty to one count of unlawful sexual
intercourse with a 15-year-old girl he propositioned while she was
being treated at Pine Grove, according to court documents. He had sex
with the girl in a Santa Clarita park in early 2000, a few months
after her release from the hospital, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Quincy Crawford, 28, is serving a three-year sentence in state
prison for having sex with a 13-year-old Pine Grove patient in a
hospital restroom in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   That girl's mother is suing Crawford, the hospital and its parent
company, Doctors Community Healthcare Corp., alleging administrators
failed to adequately protect patients. The suit also contends that
the hospital's background checks and training of employees were
insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the hospital and its parent company has denied the
allegations. A trial date is set for January.</TE>
<TE>   The county Mental Health Department concluded the fieldwork
portion of its investigation of Pine Grove on Monday and will
announce in two to three weeks what actions, if any, it will take
against the hospital, Chief Deputy Director David Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   If the county decides Pine Grove is unsafe, it could face a wide
range of sanctions, from formal warnings to the revocation of its
authority to involuntarily detain patients -- an important source of
income for many mental health hospitals, Meyer said.</TE>

<HD>Testimony Given Against Gang Member in Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A close friend of murder defendant Marcus Moralez said the El Rio
gang member came to his door the morning after a high school football
player was slain, clutching a newspaper story on the killing and
saying, "I don't know why I did it."</LD>
<LD>   His friend appeared distraught and said he might kill himself,
Phillip Tinoco testified Wednesday during the second day of a
preliminary hearing for Moralez, 21, who faces murder, perjury,
weapons possession and street terrorism charges in the 1999 slaying
of Frank Miramontez, 17.</LD>
<LD>   Moralez later turned over a handgun to Tinoco, asking him to get
rid of it, Tinoco said. "He said, 'We shouldn't live the lives we
do,' " said Tinoco, who with Moralez was a member of an El Rio gang.</LD>
<TE>   Tinoco and eight other witnesses built a case Wednesday against
Moralez, who prosecutors believe shot Miramontez six times as he sat
in his car in El Rio. A mutual friend, Gabriel Camacho, testified
Wednesday that days after the killing, he and Tinoco sold a gun in
Ojai for $40 and some marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after the slaying, Moralez claimed the shooting had
been an accident, said Daniel Gonzales, a fellow gang member who said
he and Moralez occasionally met to smoke marijuana. Moralez said he
had attempted to steal the victim's car stereo because he needed
money to support his drug habit, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Another friend of Moralez reversed his testimony Wednesday, saying
he had seen the victim giving Moralez a ride the night of the
shooting. On Tuesday, Jesus Mendoza testified that earlier statements
to police were lies.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, he said he had perjured himself the day before
because he feared retribution from Moralez's associates. "Yesterday,
I was scared something was going to happen [if I testified]. But I
couldn't hold it in any more," he said. "I couldn't hurt
[Miramontez's] mom any more."</TE>

<HD>Nurses Locked Out in Pension Fight</HD>
<DH>As its nurses hold a one-day strike, Long Beach Memorial
Medical Center hires temps to replace the regulars for five days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi and Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of nurses formed picket lines Wednesday around Long Beach
Memorial Medical Center as a labor dispute over wages and pensions
reached a new and critical phase.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 replacement nurses bused into the hospital at 6 a.m.
provided patient care, while the picketers -- some wearing their
smocks and caps -- waved signs outside and chanted, "We are the
nurses, mighty, mighty nurses."</LD>
<LD>   Union and hospital officials reported no progress in restarting
talks that broke down about two weeks ago. Hospital officials
responded to the one-day strike with a four-day lockout notice, and
said nurses returning to work this morning would be turned away.</LD>
<TE>   Although some picketers called the replacement nurses "slime," the
demonstrations were noisy, but peaceful. "It's been calm. Very
organized. Very professional," said Terry Starkman, a hospital
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The strike was the largest job action at a California hospital in
more than four years, and highlighted the labor strife occurring at
some of the largest hospitals in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Local nurses have begun organizing and taking firmer negotiating
stances in response to dramatic changes in the health-care industry
in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach dispute, which involves about 1,300 recently
unionized nurses, centers on demands for a new pension program,
better staffing and pay hikes for veteran nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials, meanwhile, said the medical center was
operating smoothly Wednesday, with about 500 patients receiving care
from nurses from a Colorado-based temporary-staffing firm. About 480
nurses, split to staff 12-hour shifts, have been hired. "All of our
units are functioning quite well," said Dr. Gainer Pillsbury, the
hospital's medical director.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders, however, questioned the quality of care. They kept
nurse "task forces" ready in case of emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "For the hospital to expose the community to questionable care by
replacement staff is not a positive scenario," said Charles Idelson,
a spokesman for the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital agreed to hire the replacements for a minimum of five
days, hence the lockout through Sunday. Union officials said the
money could have helped fund a pension program.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses are seeking a pension plan, funded by the hospital,
that would guarantee monthly payments after retirement. That differs
from the current plan that is funded by employer and employee
contributions and functions similarly to a 401(k) retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say that the hospital's contributions to the current
plan can fluctuate depending on revenues and that the plan doesn't
provide security.</TE>
<TE>   "For the nurses that have given a lifetime to the hospital of
service, we think they deserve a pension," said nurse Margie Keenan,
who has worked at Long Beach Memorial for 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan, a member of the union's negotiating team, said a secure
pension plan would go a long way toward reversing a steady departure
of nurses from the hospital during their first five years of
employment. The California Nurses Assn. says that 47% of the
hospital's nurses have less than five years of experience there.</TE>
<TE>   Pillsbury, the medical director, said the hospital has agreed to
study the creation of a pension plan, but is not willing to commit to
establishing one.</TE>
<TE>   "The financial abilities of those [other hospital] systems to put
in place or guarantee defined benefit programs may be different than
ours," he said.</TE>

<HD>Holdup Turns Into Shootout; Gunman Slain</HD>
<DH>A police officer and a clerk are wounded in Laguna Beach as
shots send shoppers and merchants scrambling for cover.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gunman was killed and two other people -- including a Laguna Beach
police officer -- were wounded Wednesday afternoon when an attempted
robbery ended in gunfire at an herb store along Laguna Beach's South
Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 2 p.m. when a slightly built man in dark
clothing shot and wounded a clerk at The Herb Import Co., a small
shop a few blocks south of Main Beach in a neighborhood of oceanside
bungalows, restaurants and boutique shops, police and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Police quickly flooded the area, halting traffic as they
surrounded and then exchanged 10 to 15 shots with the robber, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   The injured police officer was identified as Lawrence Bammer, 24,
who has been on the force about three years, said Lt. Mike Hall. He
was reported in excellent condition at Mission Hospital Regional
Medical Center with unspecified injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of the gunman and the clerk were not immediately
available. The clerk's condition also was not available.</TE>
<TE>   The gunfire sent passersby and people in nearby businesses and
restaurants scrambling for cover.</TE>
<TE>   Police and witnesses said the gunman walked into the shop, pointed
a gun at a female clerk and ordered her to give him money. She put an
unknown amount of cash into a paper bag and handed it to the gunman,
who then began handcuffing a male employee who was also in the store.</TE>
<TE>   But then the gunman shot the man, police said. As the gunman moved
to the rear of the store, the wounded man fled, running to the
adjacent Seaside Realty office.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a gunshot and ran out of the store and saw a man wearing
all black grabbing his shoulder and yelling that he'd been shot,"
said Valerie Marjes, 21, a clerk at Second Reef, a surf clothing
store across from the shooting scene.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, police arrived. People on the street directed them
to the real estate office, saying the injured man was inside.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman then stepped from the herb shop and opened fire,
wounding the officer. The gunman, carrying a duffle bag and backpack,
then ducked between vehicles and the gun battle began.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Seaside Realty, John Stanley heard the initial gunshot and
ran to the front of his business as the clerk ran in, said building
manager Danielle Purcell, who spoke with Stanley moments afterward.</TE>
<TE>   She said Stanley told her the clerk kept repeating that he needed
help.</TE>
<TE>   "John said he went outside and all of these police were pointing
guns at him," she said. "As he stepped back in the store, the suspect
popped up from the corner of the herb shop and was holding a duffel
bag or backpack. Then the police started shooting him and [Stanley]
ran back inside."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Sancho, 30, of Laguna Beach was northbound on South Coast
Highway and slowed when she saw an officer running with a gun. She
heard shots and pulled over as she saw the officer exchange fire with
the gunman, who then slipped around the corner to an automotive shop
with an RV parked outside.</TE>
<TE>   "They screamed, 'Let us see your hands! Let us see your hands!' "
Sancho said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a volley of 10 to 15 shots. Sancho ducked as bullets
struck her car.</TE>
<TE>   John McInnis, an architect in a nearby office, was walking to
lunch when he spotted a police car with an officer sprawled across
the hood "with his gun drawn, firing again and again and again under
the motor home."</TE>
<TE>   John Leon, 35, of Garden Grove and Autumn Cowell, 24, of Anaheim
watched the shootout as they lunched at Adolfo's Mexican Food.</TE>
<TE>   "This was like a movie," Leon said. "From beginning to end, it was
45 seconds. It was fast. We just sat there with our mouths open."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Nunimaker, who lives above the automotive shop, arrived home
moments after the shooting to see police drag the gunman, head and
neck covered in blood, from beneath the RV.</TE>
<TE>   "They dragged him out and cuffed him," Nunimaker said. "He was
completely lifeless."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw police dump boxes of ammunition from a
duffel bag the gunman was carrying.</TE>
<TE>   Nunimaker and others said police performed CPR on the man for
about 10 minutes, then quit. He was taken to Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center, where he was declared dead, according to the
Orange County coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer, the wounded officer, grew up in Laguna Beach and graduated
from Laguna Beach High School in 1996, then attended Irvine Valley
Community College, said D'Anne LeBon, a friend whose family met
Bammer through their church.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Bammer, Allison Cook, said Bammer was unmarried and
involved with the Young Life Christian group at Laguna Beach High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer was a police explorer in high school. He worked for the
Orange Police Department before joining his hometown force. He also
has been active with youth groups, building friendships with teens
through church and school, LeBon and others said.</TE>
<TE>   "There had to be 10 to 15 kids outside the police station making
sure Officer Bammer was OK after the word was out that he got shot,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer was supposed to pick up Joe LeBon, 16, D'Anne Lebon's son,
to go to church Wednesday afternoon, she said. After he was shot,
Bammer wrote the teen's phone number on a piece of paper and told
fellow officers to "call this number and tell him I can't go to the
youth group."</TE>

ran to the front of his business as the clerk ran in, said building
manager Danielle Purcell, who spoke with Stanley moments afterward.</TE>
<TE>   She said Stanley told her the clerk kept repeating that he needed
help.</TE>
<TE>   "John said he went outside and all of these police were pointing
guns at him," she said. "As he stepped back in the store, the suspect
popped up from the corner of the herb shop and was holding a duffel
bag or backpack. Then the police started shooting him and [Stanley]
ran back inside."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Sancho, 30, of Laguna Beach was northbound on Coast
Highway and slowed when she saw an officer running with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   She heard shots and pulled over as she saw the officer exchange
fire with the gunman, who then slipped around the corner to an
automotive shop with an RV parked outside.</TE>
<TE>   "They screamed, 'Let us see your hands! Let us see your hands!' "
Sancho said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a volley of 10 to 15 shots. Sancho ducked as bullets
struck her car.</TE>
<TE>   John McInnis, an architect in a nearby office, was walking to
lunch when he spotted a police car with an officer sprawled across
the hood "with his gun drawn, firing again and again and again under
the motor home."</TE>
<TE>   John Leon, 35, of Garden Grove and Autumn Cowell, 24, of Anaheim
watched the shootout as they lunched at Adolfo's Mexican Food.</TE>
<TE>   "This was like a movie," Leon said. "From beginning to end, it was
45 seconds. It was fast. We just sat there with our mouths open."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Nunimaker, who lives above the automotive shop, arrived home
moments after the shooting to see police drag the gunman, head and
neck covered in blood, from beneath the RV.</TE>
<TE>   "They dragged him out and cuffed him," Nunimaker said. "He was
completely lifeless."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw police dump boxes of ammunition from a
duffel bag the gunman was carrying.</TE>
<TE>   Nunimaker and others said police performed CPR on the man for
about 10 minutes, then quit.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where he
was declared dead, according to the Orange County coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer, the wounded officer, grew up in Laguna Beach and graduated
from Laguna Beach High School in 1996, then attended Irvine Valley
Community College, said D'Anne LeBon, a friend whose family met
Bammer through their church.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Bammer, Allison Cook, said Bammer was unmarried and
involved with the Young Life Christian group at Laguna Beach High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer was a police explorer in high school.</TE>
<TE>   He worked for the Orange Police Department before joining his
hometown force.</TE>
<TE>   He also has been active with youth groups, building friendships
with teens through church and school, D'Anne LeBon and others said.</TE>
<TE>   "There had to be 10 to 15 kids outside the police station making
sure Officer Bammer was OK after the word was out that he got shot,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bammer was supposed to pick up Joe LeBon, 16, D'Anne Lebon's son,
to go to church Wednesday afternoon, she said.</TE>
<TE>   After he was shot, Bammer wrote the teen's phone number on a piece
of paper and told fellow officers to "call this number and tell him I
can't go to the youth group."</TE>

<HD>The Harmony Is Missing for Neighbors Stuck Over Songs in
the Key of Strife</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The police log of the Saddleback Valley News carried this complaint
from a Lake Forest resident: "Informant states her neighbor is
banging on a common wall with a shovel because he does not like her
music."</LD>
<LD>   It can get tense when your neighbor doesn't dig your music.</LD>
<LD>   Unclear on the concept: Hugh Margerum of Santa Barbara snapped a
sign that must have been posted by an overly optimistic gardener (see
photo).</LD>
<TE>   A real topsy-turvy effort: You might have suspected that the
recent Times photo of an upside-down "Simon-for-Governor" sign
symbolized the Republican challenger's snafu-filled campaign (see
photo). But George Bromberg of North Hollywood preferred to look at
the positive side -- that the sign standing on its head could be read
as "Nowis Simon."</TE>
<TE>   And, he added, "If you continue to the bottom of the adjacent
sign, it reads 'Nowis Simon Governor.' " I think Bromberg should go
into politics as a spin doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee? Tea? Batteries? I read that two companies are working hard
to develop cell phones that airline passengers could use during
takeoffs and landings without interfering with the plane's
electronics. The FAA currently bans such practices. I don't know
about you, but I'm nervous enough during flights without a cell
yakker in the next seat. But that's not my biggest fear. No, my
biggest fear is not that passengers will become addicted to cell
phones but that pilots will -- on takeoffs and landings.</TE>
<TE>   A different kind of travel: Scott Wilson of Long Beach passed
along an ad for a machine that could seemingly transport one to a far
distant time -- before cell phones, even (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Very funny: Brian Monahan of Venice spotted a sign at the Ontario
Mills mall that would seem to taunt shoppers who can't find their
vehicles (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   They don't need no stinkin' elevators: Of the more than 350
entrants in the Ketchum Downtown YMCA Stair Climb to the Top, the
nimblest was Holger Beckman of Redondo Beach. He scaled the 75
flights of stairs in the Library Tower in 10 minutes and 10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The charity event was a bit less colorful this year because
another entrant, Tim Winter, did not compete in his Spiderman costume
as he did in 2001. But he did make three climbs -- "just because I
enjoy it," he told the L.A. Downtown News. Then there was Connie
Yuen, who placed first in her age division with a time of 17:34. Yuen
is 62 years old, I mean, young.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: In case you were wondering about the photo in
Wednesday's column of a "Posthumus Tax Cuts" sign next to a building
labeled "Wilbert Burial Vault" ... It really wasn't about cutting
taxes for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Patterson of Alta Loma and Dan and Joan Leb of Long Beach
explained that the Republican candidate in the Michigan gubernatorial
race is Dick Posthumus. I'd like to say that Posthumus is dead-even
with his opponent, but he's the underdog.</TE>

<HD>Growth Focus of Oxnard Election</HD>
<DH>City's rapid expansion is hot topic for nine candidates
running for two City Council seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the anti-sprawl limits voters placed on city growth four
years ago, Oxnard's rapid expansion remains the overriding issue for
most of the nine candidates vying for two seats on the City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbent Dean Maulhardt, 52, a local business owner and
descendant of a pioneer farming family, and eight challengers are
vying for his seat and the spot being vacated by two-term Councilman
Tom Holden, who is not seeking reelection. The top two vote-getters
in the Nov. 5 election will earn seats on the next council.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Manuel Lopez, an Oxnard institution with 24 years on the
council, is running unopposed.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the candidates said growth was their major concern.</TE>
<TE>   But most were also careful not to criticize the current council,
and said they wanted to continue the gains in crime fighting and
economic development the city has made in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Maulhardt, a councilman for eight years, said he has faith that
voters will remember the council's successes.</TE>
<TE>   "We dropped crime in half, we increased police staffing levels,"
Maulhardt said. "Our revenues are solid, our expenses are controlled.
In these tough economic times, the city is on very strong financial
footing."</TE>
<TE>   But several candidates criticized the City Council as being too
closed to the public and not responsive enough to an increase in
demand for city services prompted by new projects sprouting all over
town.</TE>
<TE>   As Ventura County's largest and fastest-growing city, Oxnard's
population increased nearly 20% in the 1990s to about 170,000
residents. And its rate of growth has only accelerated since then, as
thousands of houses have been built in the city's north end.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the City Council approved construction of the RiverPark
project along the Ventura Freeway, the largest
business-and-residential development in county history.</TE>
<TE>   The projects are all within the city's new growth boundaries, but
have caused concern, nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Former Councilman Andres Herrera, who was criticized for
supporting an ill-fated overhaul of city government structure, said
residents need his experience to tackle the financial issues faced by
a growing city.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all in all, they're doing a good job," he said. "But we
need to make sure we will have the money to pay for all these
services. There's a lot of good things that are happening. I just
don't want to lose that."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard seemed to have addressed its sprawling growth in 1998, when
voters passed a Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources measure
that prevented urban development on most of the farmland surrounding
the city.</TE>
<TE>   But it is growth within Oxnard that has some candidates worried.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just grow for the sake of growing," said candidate Saul
Medina, 29, a psychiatric social worker with the county. He said he
favors so-called "smart growth," a description of development that
clusters jobs, housing and shopping within walking distance of each
other. "We can't grow at a faster rate than we can accommodate."</TE>
<TE>   Medina also envisions a revival of Oxnard's tattered and aging
downtown. He sees a central city where college students at the
fledgling Cal State Channel Islands live in apartments and take a
shuttle bus to classes, use the city's modern red-brick library and
buy coffee and books at local shops.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to cater to this new population," Medina said. "We need
to look to downtown as a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Alex Escobell, 46, agrees that Oxnard can be a
destination for young people seeking recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown needs to be made more attractive to the youth in our
community," said the second-grade teacher. "Compared to other cities
in the county, we have a bigger population. But come nightfall,
downtown is closed and dark."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to spruce up the city's image and bring in new
business, Oxnard leaders have welcomed new projects.</TE>
<TE>   Most prominent is RiverPark along the Santa Clara River at the
junction of the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway -- one of
the most attractive undeveloped sites in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for about 2,800 living units centered on village
greens. It would include a vintage town square, a movie theater,
restaurants, hotel and convention center, three schools and athletic
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the candidates said the city has to focus more on
hiring extra police officers and firefighters. The working-class city
now has about 200 police officers and 80 firefighters after a spate
of police hiring last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago we added police officers," Maulhardt said. "We've
fallen behind and need to bring that number up again."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Al Duff, chairman of the city's planning commission,
said public safety staffing will be the foremost issue for the next
council.</TE>
<TE>   "The police need to be more visible in the community," said Duff,
67. "We need to work with our police departments, so they can begin
conversing with citizens in their own neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The retired civil engineer said Oxnard has growth under control.
City leaders are planning new schools and finding solutions to the
city's growing pains, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a master plan," Duff said. "We're in the midst of
updating our plan and revising it to meet our new demographics."</TE>
<TE>   But Susan Komar, 44, a local business owner, is calling for a
total halt in new construction for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have destroyed certain parts of Oxnard," she said. "We need
this moratorium to fix the mess that's been created. We're taxing the
infrastructure, the sewers and the schools."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to use the break to build more schools and reconfigure
roads to meet demand created by the new subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   A moratorium would be a simple but politically impossible answer,
said Martin Jones, 62, a retired real estate agent who says he wants
City Hall to be more forthcoming with information to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you would get a [majority] for a moratorium," he
said. "But we have a real problem in that the city's General Plan and
its current zoning don't mesh."</TE>
<TE>   Escobell also said a moratorium is unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "To say don't build is an impossibility," said Escobell, who
considers himself a pro-growth candidate. "If you're not growing,
people are just going to move somewhere else. If you don't provide
business and other surrounding communities do, then people will take
their money out of town."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hammons, 51, a communications technician who sits on the local
Communications Workers of America political committee, said he is
concerned with labor and family issues.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to see more affordable housing for middle-income families
and would like Oxnard to adopt a living wage ordinance, replacing the
policy that currently exists. He also echoed many candidates when he
said the City Council needs to be more open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "They wait for the last minute to publicize staff reports,"
Hammons said. "They're just not very open door."</TE>
<TE>   Elias Banales, 41, an Amtrak ticket agent, said officials have
lost touch with residents and do not see what "out of control" growth
is doing to Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming two cities," Banales said. "We have the people who
are part of the old Oxnard, who've lived here a long time, and we
have the people who've just moved into their half-million-dollar
homes. The city's not doing enough to provide for that older group."</TE>

<HD>Bush Administration Official Urges Firm Response to Terror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Humanity is being challenged by private organizations such as Al
Qaeda -- illegal combatants who would spread genocide throughout the
world -- and aggressive countermeasures are necessary, the Bush
administration's ambassador at large for war crimes issues told a
Pepperdine University student convocation Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pierre-Richard Prosper, who served as a war crimes prosecutor for
the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda genocide
trials before taking his present job last year, said that with the
Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and at the Pentagon, the
kind of mass killings that occurred abroad in the 20th century have
"now touched America."</LD>
<LD>   "It's important that justice be done," he said. "We must not let a
culture of impunity prevail."</LD>
<TE>   Prosper, whose parents emigrated from Haiti, travels the world in
his State Department job. He was in central Africa last week and will
go to Afghanistan next week to discuss war crimes issues and urge
action by authorities there against wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   After the convocation, he was approached by some who wondered why
the U.S. has refused to participate in a new international war crimes
tribunal and is seeking to exempt Americans from its prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Prosper said that the administration believes there are not
adequate safeguards in the treaty establishing the tribunal to
prevent Americans performing peacekeeping duties around the world
from being subjected to "politicized" prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador said at the outset of his talk that the Holocaust
in which Nazi Germany killed millions of Jews during World War II has
not proved a one-of-a-kind tragedy, but has been followed by the
murder of 1.7 million people in Cambodia, 250,000 deaths in strife in
the former Yugoslavia, 800,000 to 1 million murders in Rwanda and
50,000 in Sierra Leone.</TE>
<TE>   "These are more than sporadic acts of violence," he said. "All of
us must stand up against them."</TE>
<TE>   Prosper served as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County
from 1989 to 1994, and from 1994 to 1996 was an assistant U.S.
attorney for the Central District of California before going to work
for the United Nations and then the federal government.</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists Win a Battle Over L.A. Port Terminal</HD>
<DH>Court halts further building and operation of the complex
pending a final judicial ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists won an important battle Wednesday in the complex,
seesaw legal war with harbor officials over construction of a
174-acre terminal at the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel of the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal in
Los Angeles stayed further construction and operation of the massive
new container complex near the Vincent Thomas Bridge pending a final
judicial decision in the case about the adequacy of environmental
impact studies.</LD>
<LD>   In what the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the
principal litigants in the case, called a "stunning victory for
environmentalists," the court issued a four-part order that blocks:</LD>
<TE>   * Construction of the last 200 feet of a 1,200-foot wharf that is
already largely completed.</TE>
<TE>   * Erection and operation of four 16-story cranes that are being
transported from China on barges.</TE>
<TE>   * Operation of the completed portion of the wharf by China
Shipping Holding Co.</TE>
<TE>   * Construction and operation of a second wharf.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great day for local residents, who have been battling
the port for years over the right to a clean and healthy community,"
said Gail Ruderman Feuer of the environmental council.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is not necessarily to stop this thing forever," she
said. "Our goal is to figure out the environmental impacts and figure
out how to mitigate them."</TE>
<TE>   Harbor Commission President Nicholas Tonsich said if the courts
ultimately decide that additional environmental reviews are needed,
the Port of Los Angeles will be happy to comply.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the Court of Appeal wants to stay construction
while it reviews the environmental assessments is not something we
are troubled with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always striving to assure that the environment is the
foremost consideration."</TE>
<TE>   He expressed confidence that the full project will be completed
and put into operation.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over the project began more than a year ago, after the
City Council awarded China Shipping a $650-million lease agreement on
property previously used as a crude oil tank farm, tanker depot and
shipyard.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement called for construction of two wharves capable of
handling 260 cargo ships and about 1.5 million shipping containers a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Port officials warned that construction delays could sully the
harbor's reputation as a good business partner with some of the
world's largest shipping firms.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of organizations that included the environmental
council, Coalition for Clean Air, San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners
Coalition and San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners United, filed suit in
state court against the city and the port, arguing that the
environmental impact assessments had been inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   When a state court ruled against the coalition, the group moved to
federal court, challenging a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit that
the corps had approved after determining that the terminal would
actually improve regional air quality by enhancing the efficiency of
cargo handling in an existing industrial zone.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition argued that the corps had failed to gauge the
cumulative impact of the entire project before allowing construction
to begin on the first wharf.</TE>
<TE>   In August a federal judge rejected the coalition's request to halt
construction, and the work continued.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's state appellate decision brought most of that work to
a halt.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Unified Moves Recall Election to Feb. 4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana Unified School District officials Wednesday moved the
recall election of trustee Nativo V. Lopez to Feb. 4, three weeks
ahead of the originally scheduled date.</LD>
<LD>   They switched the date in hopes of holding the special election on
the same date as an anticipated election to fill a county
supervisorial seat, which could save the school district tens of
thousands of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   District officials said they learned Wednesday that the Orange
County registrar of voters had picked Feb. 4 as the probable date for
a special election for County Supervisor Todd Spitzer's seat, should
he win his bid for state Assembly on Nov. 5.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the trustees set Feb. 25 as the date for a final
showdown in the heated recall battle but left open the possibility
that the date might change.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the recall election to the school district has been
estimated at between $100,000 to $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 3rd Supervisorial District does not share boundaries
with the school district, because the county registrar conducts the
elections, costs could be shared with the county by holding the
elections on the same date.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters blame Lopez and his allies on the school board
for failure to build much-needed new schools and for low test scores
in the 62,000-student district.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has vowed to challenge the signatures on recall petitions.
He also has accused his opponents of being motivated by the board's
decision to put a new school in a relatively affluent neighborhood in
north Santa Ana.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn is taking his political feud
with Rio school district Supt. Yolanda Benitez to the streets in a
door-to-door campaign to elect two challengers to a school board that
could fire Benitez.</LD>
<LD>   Although Flynn denies his goal is to oust the superintendent,
community activists say the idea behind the effort is to reform the
school board -- a panel they say is controlled by Benitez -- and
remove her if necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "If we go after Benitez, it will bring some accountability to the
other board members," said Soledad Trevino of Citizens for
Educational Responsibility, a group that says its aim is to improve
El Rio schools.</LD>
<TE>   "We need some independent thinking brought to the process,"
Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, who represents El Rio, is walking neighborhoods on evenings
and weekends, distributing a newsletter created by the citizens'
group. It urges residents to vote for challengers Staci DePolo and
Henrietta Macias and to reelect school board member Ron Mosqueda, a
Benitez critic.</TE>
<TE>   The rift between the supervisor and the superintendent -- both
strong-willed, influential leaders -- has divided the unincorporated,
working-class town of 9,100 and pitted two well-known Democrats
against each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of public record, this dispute between Yolanda and
John," former county Democratic Party Chairman Hank Lacayo said.
"It's politics and you expect these kinds of fireworks. The only
difference is that Yolanda's not an elected official.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of sad because we're dealing with something that has to
do with education and kids," Lacayo said. "I wish they'd find some
common ground and consider the effect on the whole community."</TE>
<TE>   The duo have quarreled ever since Benitez broke ranks and
supported Flynn's challenger, Francisco Dominguez, in the 2000
supervisorial race.</TE>
<TE>   But Flynn said his stumping for trustee candidates in the Nov. 5
election has nothing to do with past clashes. He said his involvement
stems from the district's unwillingness to cooperate in providing
recreational programs for children at El Rio's new $3-million
gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that I'm not able to serve the children and young
adults in the community as far as recreational activities are
concerned," Flynn said. "The present people in charge of the district
-- a majority of the board of trustees and the superintendent -- have
for whatever reason been unable to cooperate on the use of the
gymnasium."</TE>
<TE>   Benitez declined to comment on Flynn's role in the race except to
say, "I want everybody to be sure to get their facts correct and not
let this turn into an attack on anyone."</TE>
<TE>   But El Rio school board President Anthony Ramos, a Benitez backer,
said Flynn should stay out of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "What he should be concerned with is county business and his board
and leave Rio with the Rio school board," Ramos said. "We have a race
based on personalities rather than on what's good for children."</TE>
<TE>   If elected, the Flynn-backed candidates could change the tone of
the five-member school board, whose majority is represented by Ramos,
Simon Ayala and George Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala, Perez and Mosqueda are up for reelection. In addition to
Macias and DePolo, a third challenger is former Rio school board
member Jean Mattson, whom Ramos supports.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the community is very satisfied with the direction we
set and that Yolanda is implementing," Ramos said. "I don't think
that's an issue. The issue is we need to continue what we started and
see where it takes us."</TE>
<TE>   But Macias, a union organizer with United Food and Commercial
Workers, said change is needed for El Rio's 4,000 public
schoolchildren. She entered the race, Macias said, because of
concerns over test scores, district spending and teacher retention.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what kind of job [Benitez] is doing, to tell you the
truth," Macias said. "I'm not going to put the blame on her. If I'm
supported by John Flynn, then I'm happy about it. He's done a lot for
our community. But this has nothing to do with John Flynn."</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda said he was impressed with Benitez when she came to the
district eight years ago. But his support has diminished, especially
after seeing the latest Stanford 9 test scores that show "69% of our
eighth-graders couldn't spell," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scores posted on the state Department of Education's Web site show
31% of eighth-grade students in the district performed at or above
the 50th percentile in spelling.</TE>
<TE>   "After eight years under her leadership, maybe it's time for a
change," Mosqueda said. "This is a critical, critical election. The
test scores aren't lying."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he is merely responding to residents who want some help
in the gymnasium dispute. "That's my reason and my only reason for
being involved in this campaign," Flynn said. "If Yolanda Benitez was
to decide to cooperate ... then my issues would disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Built with state, county and school district money, the gym was
mostly idle for six months after it opened last year because of
squabbling between the county and school district over insurance and
who was responsible for managing recreational programs. The district
and the county operate it together under a 1997 joint agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Activities League was finally able to provide a program
with funding from the Sheriff's Department, the school district and a
state grant. But it ran short of money in August and closed. When
school opened this fall, there were no after-school activities at the
gym.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a concern of his [Flynn's] because under the
joint-use agreement, after-school time is his county time," Ramos
said. "The whole point was to have the county provide the programs."</TE>

<LD>A suspected car thief who allegedly pulled a handgun on police in
Santa Ana was shot several times by officers Wednesday and was
hospitalized in critical condition, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began Wednesday morning when a Santa Ana resident
reported the theft of his 1992 Plymouth Voyager, said Santa Ana
Police Sgt. Baltazar de la Riva. The owner called again at 12:21 p.m.
and said he had seen his vehicle driven by the suspect at Daisy
Avenue and Willits Street, De la Riva said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers spotted the van at 1st and Clara streets, De la Riva
said. Police pursued the driver through residential neighborhoods to
an apartment complex at 810 S. Sullivan St., where the man stopped
and exited the van. De la Riva said the man ran through yards and
jumped over fences until he reached the 2100 block of West Brook
Street, where he was cornered by two Santa Ana officers.</LD>
<TE>   The man pulled out a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and was
shot several times by the two officers, said De la Riva. It was
unknown if the suspect fired any shots at the officers.</TE>
<TE>   De la Riva said the wounded man was transported to UCI Medical
Center, where he was reported in critical condition. Police were
still trying to confirm his identity Wednesday evening.</TE>

<LD>The remains of an Army captain shot down over Laos in 1966 will be
returned this week and transported to Arlington National Cemetery for
burial Nov. 1, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Larry Lucas' plane crashed Dec. 20 during a reconnaissance
mission over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In 1989, an American doctor on a
medical mission to Southeast Asia noticed a Laotian patient wearing
Lucas' dog tags. Villagers subsequently led Army investigators to a
crash site, but there was no sign of Lucas. A decade later,
instigators returned and found pieces of Lucas' watch and camera, as
well as bone fragments.</LD>

packed in duffel bags and hidden in scrub brush in the desert near
the Mexican border, officials announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday afternoon, agents stationed near the border about 25 miles
east of Tecate saw 10 men bolting south toward Mexico. The agents
gave chase, but the men made it to the border fence and crossed.</LD>

marijuana with a street value of about $280,000, said Gloria Chavez

<LD>A judge has sentenced a former Manteca councilman to 120 days in
jail, five years' probation and 500 hours of community service for
soliciting a bribe while in office.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Stephen Demetras said Dave Macedo, 45, is eligible to enter
an alternative work program that would trade more community service
for jail time.</LD>
<LD>   Macedo was arrested in June with $7,500 cash after he approached
City Atty. John Brinton, seeking money in exchange for a vote to
renew Brinton's contract with a 6% raise.</LD>

<LD>Despite popular catch-and-release techniques, a study blames
recreational anglers for overfishing that has some California species
near extinction.</LD>
<LD>   Recreational fishermen have long denied responsibility for
overfishing and blamed commercial fishing for ocean looting. But a
new study from the Marine Science Institute at UC Santa Barbara
contradicts that view.</LD>
<LD>   The analysis showed that the recreational catch of 17 species of
rockfish exceeded the commercial catch every year from 1980 to 2000.</LD>

<HD>Navy Sailor Feels Lucky After Seven Hours in Sea</HD>
<DH>Seaman blown off carrier by jet exhaust during maneuvers
off the coast says he began having his doubts before rescuers spotted
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A Navy sailor says he feels lucky to have survived an aircraft
carrier accident that left him floating in the frigid Pacific Ocean
for more than seven hours.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Harris, 21, plunged off the USS Constellation early
Saturday when the engine exhaust from a nearby EA-6B Prowler blew him
overboard off the coast of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   In the early morning darkness, it took rescuers more than seven
hours to find the airman apprentice, who is based at Lemoore Naval
Air Station, and pull him from the 62-degree waters.</LD>
<TE>   "They teach you not to panic," he said Monday at a naval hospital.
"My first reaction was 'They'll find me.' "</TE>
<TE>   But as time passed, Harris began to worry about dying of
hypothermia and whether sharks might home in on the blood oozing from
facial injuries he sustained in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, of Dillsburg, Pa., also thought about his mother and his
younger brother.</TE>
<TE>   "How were they going to tell my mom?" he wondered.</TE>
<TE>   As dawn arrived, Harris released a dye marker into the water,
staining the sea a fluorescent yellow-green. Soon afterward, a small
boat loaded with searchers sped about 50 feet away. But its crew
failed to hear or see him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little angry they didn't see me," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes later, he was spotted by a helicopter and a rescue
swimmer was sent to help him out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said that immediately after the fall, he had been startled
to see the massive warship steaming away.</TE>
<TE>   "For a few minutes, I was scared," he said. "For a while, I felt
alone, but when I realized they were looking for me, I didn't feel
alone."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who suffered broken bones in his face and the effects of
hypothermia, is "incredibly lucky" to have survived the ordeal, said
one of his doctors, Capt. Thomas Magrino.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, experts predict a person could die of hypothermia within
4 1/2 hours in 62-degree water. "We're glad the textbooks are wrong,"
the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Constellation and its flotilla of escort ships are conducting
their final training exercise before departing for a six-month
deployment to the Persian Gulf early next month.</TE>

<HD>Secession Leaders Fear City Hall Revenge If Bids Fail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Backers of San Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood say they fear
City Hall might retaliate against them and the breakaway areas if the
secession measures lose in the Nov. 5. election.</LD>
<LD>   While expressing confidence of a victory, secession leaders say
they still worry that city officials will take a range of punitive
actions if the measures fail -- from cutting funds for pro-breakup
groups to keeping secession supporters off city commissions to
rolling back services in the Valley and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn and other officials took steps Wednesday to
assure Valley and Hollywood residents that no one involved in the
rebellion would be punished.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Hahn said on a local radio broadcast, he will continue to
increase services to the Valley and Hollywood. "We don't want to
retaliate against anybody," Hahn said. "What we want to do is do a
better job of delivering services to neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made his remarks on KFWB-AM (980) after a Chatsworth man
called in to raise the issue. Hahn's response did not impress Carlos
Ferreyra, co-chair of the Valley Independence Committee. "His history
shows that he does not keep his promises, so that [retaliation] is a
big concern," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, the chairman of Valley VOTE, said a secession loss
might result in indirect punishment because the city would have less
incentive to maintain service improvements in the Valley and
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scott, another Valley VOTE leader, said Hahn has a
"scorched earth" policy toward secessionists. Scott said that was
made clear when the mayor removed him from the city Planning
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been on their side on this issue there is no doubt I
would still be on the Planning Commission," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hahn advisor Kam Kuwata noted that other Valley residents
who back secession, including Police Commissioner Bert Boeckmann -- a
big financial contributor to the cause -- have been kept on
commissions.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn's attitude could change if secession leaders seek to put
Valley cityhood on the 2004 ballot if it is defeated next month,
Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   "This mayor wants to work with everyone to move Los Angeles
forward," Kuwata said. "If they don't want to move forward, that
could be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said it would not make sense
for Hahn to punish the secession leaders because he would need the
Valley's backing to win reelection in three years, just as he did in
last year's mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   "That was part of his coalition," Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Valley residents might try to put secession back on
the ballot if the city cuts services, the consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla, a leader of the
anti-secession effort, said services will continue to improve.
Padilla disclosed Wednesday that he is already meeting with Valley
secession supporters to talk about how they can work together after
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I have extended the olive branch," said Padilla, who represents
the northeast Valley. "Not that I am taking for granted the vote on
Nov. 5, but it is looking more and more like it is not going to
pass."</TE>
<TE>   Scott and others said it is less likely City Hall would punish
secession backers if the measure passes in the Valley, even if it
loses citywide. To win, the Valley and Hollywood breakup measures
must get a majority of votes in the secession area and Los Angeles as
a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely different if it passes in the Valley [only],"
Scott said. "That would certainly give some strength to the Valley
leadership to be at the table."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Eric Garcetti, a breakup opponent who represents
part of Hollywood, said some city officials have talked privately
about blackballing secession leaders but he is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some folks in the bureaucracy who wanted to gloat and
write people off. But that's dissipated a lot," Garcetti said. "There
are some of us who want to open the doors to those people [who
support secession]."</TE>
<TE>   An Oct. 16 poll by The Times found 56% of likely voters citywide
oppose secession and 27% favor it. Likely Valley voters were leaning
against secession 47% to 42%, a gap that falls within the poll's
margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   But secessionists were buoyed Wednesday by a poll done for KABC-TV
by Survey USA. It found Valley cityhood supported by 58% of likely
voters in the Valley and 40% citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, 57% of likely voters oppose Valley secession, the poll
found.</TE>
<TE>   The survey questioned 555 Valley voters and 540 outside the
Valley, Survey USA editor Fred Bierman said. It has a margin of error
of 4.3 percentage points for the Valley sample and 4.4 points for the
citywide result.</TE>
<TE>   Some polling experts have expressed doubts about Survey USA's
methodology. The automated telephone poll does not use live
interviewers. In the secession survey, it asked a single question to
determine whether a respondent is a likely voter: "Will you
definitely vote on this issue?"</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll used live interviewers and asked a series of
questions to determine whether respondents are likely voters.</TE>

<LD>Backers of San Fernando Valley and Hollywood cityhood say they fear
City Hall might retaliate against them and the breakaway areas if the
secession measures lose in the Nov. 5. election.</LD>
<LD>   While expressing confidence of a victory, secession leaders say
they still worry that city officials will take a range of punitive
actions if the measures fail -- from cutting funds for pro-breakup
groups to keeping secession supporters off city commissions to
rolling back services in the Valley and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn and other officials took steps Wednesday to
assure Valley and Hollywood residents that no one involved in the
rebellion would be punished.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Hahn said on a local radio broadcast, he will continue to
increase services to the Valley and Hollywood. "We don't want to
retaliate against anybody," Hahn said. "What we want to do is do a
better job of delivering services to neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made his remarks on KFWB-AM (980) after a Chatsworth man
called in to raise the issue. "If in fact it didn't pass, would you
guys downtown retaliate against us and [say] 'We'll show you,' and
that our services will be cut back even more?" the caller asked.
Hahn's response did not impress Carlos Ferreyra, co-chair of the
Valley Independence Committee. "His history shows that he does not
keep his promises, so that [retaliation] is a big concern," Ferreyra
said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, the chairman of Valley VOTE, said a secession loss
might result in indirect punishment because the city would have less
incentive to maintain service improvements in the Valley and
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scott, another Valley VOTE leader, said Hahn has a
"scorched earth" policy toward secessionists. Scott said that was
made clear when the mayor removed him from the city Planning
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been on their side on this issue there is no doubt I
would still be on the Planning Commission," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hahn advisor Kam Kuwata noted that other Valley residents
who back secession, including Police Commissioner Bert Boeckmann -- a
big financial contributor to the cause -- have been kept on
commissions.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn's attitude could change if secession leaders seek to put
Valley cityhood on the 2004 ballot if it is defeated next month,
Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   "This mayor wants to work with everyone to move Los Angeles
forward," Kuwata said. "If they don't want to move forward, that
could be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said it would not make sense
for Hahn to punish the secession leaders because he would need the
Valley's backing to win reelection in three years, just as he did in
last year's mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   "That was part of his coalition," Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Valley residents might try to put secession back on
the ballot if the city cuts services, the consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla, a leader of the
anti-secession effort, said services will continue to improve.
Padilla disclosed Wednesday that he is already meeting with Valley
secession supporters to talk about how they can work together after
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I have extended the olive branch," said Padilla, who represents
the northeast Valley. "Not that I am taking for granted the vote on
Nov. 5, but it is looking more and more like it is not going to
pass."</TE>
<TE>   Scott and others said it is less likely City Hall would punish
secession backers if the measure passes in the Valley, even if it
loses citywide. To win, the Valley and Hollywood breakup measures
must get a majority of votes in the secession area and Los Angeles as
a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely different if it passes in the Valley [only],"
Scott said. "That would certainly give some strength to the Valley
leadership to be at the table."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Eric Garcetti, a breakup opponent who represents
part of Hollywood, said some city officials have talked privately
about blackballing secession leaders but he is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some folks in the bureaucracy who wanted to gloat and
write people off. But that's dissipated a lot," Garcetti said. An
Oct. 16 poll by The Times found 56% of likely voters citywide oppose
secession and 27% favor it. Likely Valley voters were leaning against
secession 47% to 42%, a gap that falls within the poll's margin of
error.</TE>
<TE>   But secessionists were buoyed Wednesday by a poll conducted for
KABC-TV by Survey USA. The poll found Valley cityhood supported by
58% of likely voters in the Valley and 40% citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, 57% of likely voters oppose Valley secession, the poll
found.</TE>
<TE>   The survey questioned 555 Valley voters and 540 outside the
Valley, Survey USA editor Fred Bierman said. It has a margin of error
of 4.3 percentage points for the Valley sample and 4.4 points for the
citywide result.</TE>
<TE>   Some polling experts have expressed doubts about Survey USA's
methodology. The automated telephone poll does not use live
interviewers. In the secession survey, it asked a single question to
determine whether a respondent is a likely voter: "Will you
definitely vote on this issue?"</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll used live interviewers and asked a series of
questions to determine whether respondents are likely voters.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Hahn's anti-secession campaign released a mailer
sent to voters that claims, "The breakaway cities may not have
sufficient funds to combat crime, respond to natural disasters and
protect us from terrorist threats."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have accused the mayor of trying to frighten voters.
They note that the state commission that approved the secession
measures for the ballot determined that Valley and Hollywood cities
would be financially healthy and able to provide the same level of
service that Los Angeles does.</TE>

<HD>Grant Hastens Construction of El Rio Sewer System</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The construction of a sewer system in El Rio can begin in several
months, thanks to a $2.5-million state water board award to Ventura
County, Supervisor John Flynn said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Flynn said the money guarantees that the area's septic tanks will
be phased out by 2008, the mandatory date for doing so set by the
Regional Water Quality Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   The county has been looking for ways to fund the project since
2000, when the state water board ordered homeowners in El Rio and
surrounding areas to stop using septic tanks and to build sewer
systems.</LD>
<TE>   Flynn said the county has raised close to $1 million for the
project, but added it would not have been able to start so quickly
without the grant.</TE>
<TE>   El Rio lies on a vital recharge area known as the Oxnard Forebay,
a 10-square-mile sandy section where water can easily filter down to
aquifers under the Oxnard Plain. Those aquifers supply drinking water
to residents in parts of Ventura, Oxnard and Port Hueneme, as well as
unincorporated communities such as El Rio and Saticoy.</TE>
<TE>   Studies in the last several years have concluded that septic
system effluent was seeping into the ground water and contaminating
it with bacteria that can cause vomiting and diarrhea.</TE>

<LD>A spate of mail thefts in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys has
prompted U.S. Postal Service inspectors to warn that residents should
report any suspicious activity around neighborhood mailboxes.</LD>
<LD>   Mail thieves look for mail containing financial information,
checks or credit cards. Thefts are most common in areas that have
neighborhood delivery and curbside mailboxes, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Victims of mail theft may call the U.S. Postal Inspection Service
at (626) 405-1200. Rewards of up to $10,000 are paid for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of mail thieves.</LD>

<HD>Family Pitched In for Ortiz</HD>
<DH>The Tuckers opened their home and hearts to help Angels
player adjust to U.S. culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back when he was a minor league ballplayer and barely spoke a word of
English, Angels pitcher Ramon Ortiz told Jim and Angie Tucker,
"You're going to be my American family."</LD>
<LD>   It was 1998, and they'd just met Ortiz during a game in Lake
Elsinore, where the young Dominican pitcher was playing for the
Angels farm club. The Tuckers were just spectators but, after a
chance meeting, the three became fast friends when Ortiz found out
Angie spoke Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the couple was skeptical of Ortiz's promise to stay in
touch. They smiled and said their goodbyes.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been around a lot of players. We've heard a lot of talk,"
said Jim Tucker, 39, a devout Angels fan who has followed the team
all his life.</TE>
<TE>   His wife agreed: "Naturally, I was sitting there going, 'Yeah,
right.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Ortiz did not forget. He burrowed his way into their lives,
bunked with them in Buena Park for a couple seasons after being
called up to the majors, and turned Angie Tucker into a good-luck
charm.</TE>
<TE>   So on Tuesday, when Ortiz pitched Game 3 of the World Series
against the San Francisco Giants, the couple took their seats in the
section allotted for Angels' family members, right alongside Ortiz's
wife and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "They're my family. They take care of me," Ortiz said Wednesday.
"For me, I'm very happy they got to watch me pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's game may have been the highlight of the 29-year-old
pitcher's career, but the Tuckers, who now live in Cerritos, have
been there for just about every big moment -- and the not-so-big
ones.</TE>
<TE>   A year after meeting Ortiz in Lake Elsinore, the Tuckers bumped
into Ortiz for a second time during a 1999 Angels spring training
game in Arizona. He sought them out and gave Angie Tucker a T-shirt
he had brought back for her from the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   They were friendly, familiar faces, Ortiz explained. And he
finally had someone to talk to in Spanish. Every night the Tuckers
were in Arizona they spent with Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really happy," Angie Tucker recalled, "because he knew
somebody there."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Ortiz phoned the Tuckers with his big news.
Angie Tucker wasn't home, but his message was clear, even when it
came in broken English, her husband said. Ortiz had just been called
up to the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'grande liga' and 'my first start' and 'pitching in
Chicago,' " Jim Tucker said. "I understood that."</TE>
<TE>   As luck would have it, Angie Tucker was in Chicago visiting her
son. That night, she watched Ortiz, her surrogate son, pitch his
first major league game. He struck out nine and beat the White Sox,
8-1.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Orange County, Ortiz spent his free time with the Tucker
family and, eventually, moved in with them. The Tuckers were even
given explicit instructions from Ortiz's mother in the Dominican
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "She tells me, 'Let me know if he's misbehaving,' and 'You can
pull his ears any time you want,' " Angie Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   As they adopted Ortiz into their family, they helped him learn
English and American culture. They still tease him about the time
giggling store clerks asked him, "Can I have your number?"</TE>
<TE>   No problem, Ortiz said. He gave them his autograph and jotted down
"#36," his uniform number.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very naive when he first started," Angie Tucker said. "It
was just like raising a child again."</TE>
<TE>   They attend every home game Ortiz pitches. And, ever since Angie
Tucker smiled and waved to Ortiz before one of his winning games, she
must repeat that pattern for good luck.</TE>
<TE>   So there was no question Ortiz would be taking them with him to
San Francisco for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday afternoon, Ortiz didn't have to ride the team bus because
starting pitchers can arrive late to games. Rather than catch a cab,
he asked Jim Tucker to drive him to the game, so he could relax and
listen to merengue, the fast, Latin dance music.</TE>
<TE>   But when they left the hotel, they were immediately caught in city
traffic. Ortiz kept glancing at his watch and began fretting that he
might be late. Several nervous minutes later, Jim Tucker waved down a
motorcycle officer. This was the last thing Ortiz needed to be
worried about before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the starting pitcher for the Angels," Tucker told the
officer. "He needs to get to the stadium." Ortiz chimed in, "I've got
to go. I've got to go pitch."</TE>
<TE>   If the cop was a Giants fan, he set that aside and escorted them
to Pacific Bell Park, where Ortiz arrived with a few minutes to
spare.</TE>
<TE>   "Never a dull moment with Ramon," Jim Tucker said. "That's my
World Series memory."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that and Barry Bonds' three-pitch strikeout. And the win, of
course -- the big, fat W next to Ortiz's name in the World Series
history books.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / MONO LAKE</KH>
<HD>Otherworldly Scene Never Loses Its Allure</HD>
<DH>Hulking tufa mounds are irresistible to photographers and
wide-eyed tourists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Ferrell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To some they resemble melted wax towers. To others they look like
sandcastles, or slabs of coral reef. From some angles they could even
be futuristic city skylines, or pieces of modern art, or -- perish
the thought -- hulking mounds of guano.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever they might suggest, the strange tufa formations of Mono
Lake are one of California's most irresistible sights for
photographers. Dennis Flaherty has made hundreds of trips and shot
thousands of frames. Next summer, he plans to teach a weeklong photo
workshop -- one of the many that convene here -- in which students
will camp overnight to capture the vivid sunsets and dawns.</LD>
<LD>   "Photographers come from all over the world to photograph Mono
Lake," said Flaherty, 48, whose work has appeared on calendars and
posters and in National Geographic magazine. "It really is a magical
place. Sometimes it reminds me of being on the moon -- except for the
water, of course."</LD>
<TE>   The lake, on the east edge of the Sierra Nevada, is thought to be
one of the oldest in North America, the vestige of a once-vast inland
sea. It is part of a volcanic wilderness bordering Yosemite National
Park, south of Lake Tahoe on U.S. 395.</TE>
<TE>   The tufa formations are created by calcium-rich springs spurting
up from the lake bottom. The calcium bonds to carbonates in the
water, resulting in calcium carbonate, a type of limestone. The
craggy, earth-toned spires are but one of the features that lend Mono
Lake an otherworldly appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain ridges rim the lake, but they are sufficiently far away
to suggest a feeling of tremendous openness and desolation. The
shallow bowl that contains the lake is a treeless expanse of low
brush: pale green, brown, white in places.</TE>
<TE>   Wind and high clouds move unhindered across the landscape. The
lake reflects the colors of the sky, changing by the hour. It can be
icy blue or gray, various shades of red and orange, even brilliant
purple.</TE>
<TE>   Don Jackson photographs Western wildlife and landscapes for a
living and regularly makes the seven-hour drive from his home near
Santa Rosa. He first saw the lake 17 years ago, during a trip to
Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Wow, this is bizarre,' " recalled Jackson, 50. He likes
to kayak and camp on the lake's two islands, and said his favorite
times to photograph are "those magical moments before sunrise. The
light is so beautiful there. I love it in all seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been there in dead of winter, when it was almost down to
zero [degrees]. I've had my cameras covered in ice, been through
brutal storms. They get up to 6-foot waves on that lake. You've got
to have your wits about you."</TE>
<TE>   Mono Lake is an oddity in other ways too. It is nearly three times
as salty as the Pacific Ocean. Not a single fish lives here, but the
water teems with brine shrimp scarcely half an inch long -- an
estimated 4 trillion of them. The lake is also a nesting ground for
50,000 California seagulls, which migrate about 200 miles -- crossing
the Sierra Nevada en route -- to lay eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Painting the water's edge is a shimmering line made up of millions
of black brine flies. They provided sustenance to the early Paiute
Indians, who fed on fly larvae collected from the lake in tightly
woven baskets. Mark Twain visited in 1872 and marveled at the swath
of flies, an inch deep and 6 feet wide, extending "clear around the
lake--a belt of flies 100 miles long," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The waters are so alkali, Twain said, "that if you only dip the
most hopelessly soiled garment into them once or twice and wring it
out, it will be found as clean as if it had been through the ablest
of washerwomen's hands."</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began to
tap the lake's watershed. In the ensuing years, the level of the lake
fell more than 40 feet, touching off one of California's most heated
and protracted environmental battles. "Save Mono Lake!" urged
activists who united to form the Mono Lake Committee. Their campaign
resulted in a milestone victory eight years ago, when the California
State Water Resources Control Board issued an order to save the lake.
The water has risen about a foot a year since that action. But,
ironically, the city's past exploitation has produced a wonder more
stunning than ever. As photographer Warren Marr noted, fantastic tufa
formations are now visible that otherwise would require a submersible
to see.</TE>
<TE>   "To have those sticking out of the water makes such an incredibly
unique [scene]," he said. "You can find tufa formations in other
places -- south of Trona, for example -- but they have no water
around them, and they have no sense of mystery or power."</TE>
<TE>   A narrow boardwalk leads to one of the most extensive tufa areas
on the lake's south shore. A mile-long, self-guided tour winds past
clusters of formations in the water and on dry land. A sign next to
one outcropping of gray spikes, mottled with brown, notes that
receding water exposed the formation in 1963. Towering 20 feet above
a low sea of brush, it looks like the mud nests of giant wasps.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, Keith McNeely, 43, a visitor from the San Diego
area, inspected a tufa cluster at the shoreline. "It reminds me of
what you'd see in a cave: stalagmites," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His teenage son, Phillip, found it hard to believe that fly larvae
were once used for food.</TE>
<TE>   "Yummy," he said, making a face.</TE>
<TE>   "Mind boggling," agreed Naomi Schechter, 58, visiting from New
York City. "But you work with what you have."</TE>
<TE>   She smiled, looking around -- at the tufa, the backdrop of
mountains, at what she called the grand Western sky. "The colors are
really pure. It's hard to find this kind of big sky in the East.
These formations and the big sky ... it's a unique environment ...
very magical. My mind is blown."</TE>

<HD>West Hills Teacher Steals the Spotlight</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With California's first lady visiting the West Hills campus
Wednesday, there was no way Jennifer Yoo could have known she was
going to be the center of attention.</LD>
<LD>   In front of an assembly of 500 children, teachers and news media,
the unsuspecting Welby Way Elementary School teacher was presented a
$25,000 award given to 100 of the nation's best educators.</LD>
<LD>   Yoo is one of four teachers in California and one of two in the
Los Angeles Unified School District to receive the award. Jane Fung,
a kindergarten/first-grade teacher at Lafayette Park Primary Center
in Los Angeles, also won.</LD>
<TE>   The National Educator Awards are presented annually by the Santa
Monica-based Milken Family Foundation, a nonprofit group that seeks
to promote the value of teachers and encourage more retention of
talent in education. Since 1985, the foundation has honored 1,877
teachers and given out $46.9 million in awards.</TE>
<TE>   Winners are chosen by a research committee that finds innovative
educators who have inspired students and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew from second grade that I wanted to be a teacher," said
Yoo, 33. "There is no other job, no other passion I can think of
having."</TE>
<TE>   After Gov. Gray Davis' wife, Sharon, congratulated Welby Way
students for their high test scores, Lowell Milken, chairman and
co-founder of the foundation, then announced Yoo's award. The
students cheered and Yoo was immediately moved to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "America is a very strong country," Milken said. "But we don't
support and honor our teachers enough."</TE>
<TE>   Yoo, a teacher for nine years, is now a leading literacy coach for
grades three through five and also trains colleagues. In her lessons,
which are geared at achieving state educational standards, she said
she strongly believes in rewarding children for achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Yoo's family left Seoul when she was 5 to seek better educational
opportunities. They settled in Koreatown before moving to South Gate
and then Downey.</TE>
<TE>   As a student teacher in the early 1990s, Yoo helped put her
brother through graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   She said her family has inspired her to succeed. "I wish they
could have been here."</TE>
<TE>   At Lafayette Park Primary Center on Wednesday afternoon, teachers
and students attending an assembly saw Fung receive her $25,000
award.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea at all," Fung said. "This is really a great honor.
I'm really lucky because I work with new teachers that have been
quick to praise me and thank me."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Hong Kong and 16-year veteran teacher, Fung
specializes in helping students learn English. She also mentors other
teachers, stressing that education should be centered on the
individual needs of a child.</TE>
<TE>   Fung said she believes more Americans are recognizing the
importance of teachers and how hard their job is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an 8-to-2 job," she said. "We live and breathe this on
weekends too. It's a lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Maribel Garcia, a teacher at William Laird Adam Elementary School
in Santa Maria, and Don Ogden, principal at Camellia Basic School in
Sacramento, also were selected as Milken national educators.</TE>

<HD>Giant Roots Versus Angel Rooters</HD>
<DH>In Riverside, the legacy of Barry Bonds and Dusty Baker
creates a divide in local loyalties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>Maybe it's that the name Momma Bonds still summons a palpable
reverence on the worn streets of the Eastside neighborhood, even a
certain fear among those old enough to remember how her stare could
ice down the blistering summer heat if they were acting up.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's that there are still those who insist that Bobby Bonds
was faster than the Santa Ana winds, or remember that they're
standing on the same dirt that gave Dusty Baker his name.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the case -- even if the Anaheim Angels are the de facto
home team out here, even if two Angel stars call Riverside home --
this town is torn.</LD>
<TE>   Though most newer arrivals in this area consider the Angels
"their" team, old-timers and civic leaders know that the two leaders
of the San Francisco Giants -- slugger Barry Bonds, son of 1970s
superstar Bobby Bonds, and sage manager Dusty Baker -- have roots in
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels and Giants duke it out in the World Series this
week, even 88-year-old Elizabeth Bonds, better known as Momma --
grandmother of Barry, mother of Bobby -- says she can't bring herself
to pick sides.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm for all of them, darling," she said at her old house on
Vasquez Place, an island of faith and grace in a neighborhood that
has fallen to competing gangs. "I'm not pulling for anybody to win or
lose. I'm just looking for a good, clean game. And then it will be
over."</TE>
<TE>   Riverside was still a hicks-and-orange-groves town when
Mississippi native Ameal Moore moved here in 1960 to assume his
appointment at March Air Force Base. Back then, the Angel franchise
was in its infancy over the hills that line the western edge of the
Inland Empire, and Moore opted to take his three sons to Dodger
games. He quickly developed a Southern Californian's proper distaste
for the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   One Who's Torn</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I spent most of my time and most of my money,
watching my sons go back and forth to buy hot dogs," Moore said.
"Bobby Bonds -- he was a star, you know -- it seemed like he would
always find a way to beat the Dodgers. I hated those Giants!"</TE>
<TE>   But Moore, now a Riverside city councilman who eventually became
an Angel fan, also came to appreciate the local Bonds and Baker
legacies. He learned about the achievement of Rosie Bonds, an
80-meter hurdles finalist in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the African
American pride that permeated the Bonds home. He learned about the
sense of community instilled in the Baker kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of those that's torn," Moore said. "Naturally, I like the
Angels because they are a Southern California team. But I like the
Giants too, with that connection to Riverside -- with Bonds and
Dusty. There is a lot of mixed emotion out here."</TE>
<TE>   Leon Culpepper doesn't feel torn at all.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated in 1964 from Riverside Poly High School, known to
locals as "Old Poly" to distinguish it from a newer school that has
since replaced it. That was the same year that Bobby Bonds graduated
from Old Poly after starring in football, baseball and track, then
immediately signed the contract with the San Francisco Giants that
would lead him to stardom.</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Baker lived in Riverside too, and they all ran around
Eastside together. Culpepper and Bonds competed in track together at
Old Poly. They matured together when they disagreed over whether they
should caddy for the white golfers in town -- Culpepper thought it
would be nice to have a little money in his pocket; Bonds preferred
to be poor and proud, Culpepper said.</TE>
<TE>   They became young fathers about the same time, a few years out of
high school. They both lost their fathers in 1983. Bonds is godfather
to Culpepper's oldest son, Colin. When Bobby Bonds arrived in
Riverside before the World Series, Culpepper picked him up at the
airport, as usual, and Bonds surprised him with prized tickets to the
weekend games in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   A Giant Fan Since '64</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think?" Culpepper said when asked about his World
Series loyalties. "I've been a Giants fan since '64, when Bobby
signed his contract."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other Eastsiders, Alex Tortes attended Park Avenue
Baptist Church. So did his friend Johnnie Baker Jr., whose father had
settled in Riverside in 1945 after a tour of duty in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Baker provided his friends with running commentary during
Sunday school, and the preacher always seemed to be sending him to
stand in the corner. He was also perpetually covered in Riverside's
rust-colored dirt -- giving him, eventually, the nickname "Dusty."</TE>
<TE>   "This is deeper than just team loyalty. These are my buddies,"
said Tortes, now 56 and the Riverside Police Department lieutenant
who runs law enforcement operations in Eastside. "So I have to go
with the Giants."</TE>
<TE>   Park Avenue has long since moved to a bigger and fancier church --
emblematic, perhaps, of the changing faces of Riverside, and the
other side of the city's divided loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   If residents like Culpepper, Davis and Tortes seem to recall a
different Riverside, that's because it was a different Riverside. The
orange groves, for the most part, are gone now. Riverside's
population has skyrocketed -- it grew by about 35,000 in the 1990s
alone -- and the Inland Empire has grown from a far-flung outpost to
an integral part of metropolitan Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For the younger generation, there may be a Bobby Bonds Sports
Complex, but the Angels are just on the other side of those hills,
and Barry Bonds is simply a San Francisco Giant and an impediment to
Angel glory.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a sea of red out here," said Tom Reiss, a retired law
enforcement officer and a Little League district official who lives
just outside the Riverside limits. Each year, Reiss' league has an
Angel Night, when about 300 young players head down the Riverside
Freeway to Edison Field, march on the diamond and meet some Angels.
"Most of the kids that are growing up here now are Angels fans," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Angels Near and Dear</TE>
<TE>   Reiss' grandson, 10-year-old Shane Boehmer, is a Little League
catcher and pitcher in Riverside. He likes the Giants -- "kind of,"
he said. But he is devoted to the Angels. "I've always rooted for
them," he said. "They're my favorites."</TE>
<TE>   And as strong as the Bonds and Baker roots are in Riverside, Angel
fans can counter with a family tree of their own. Adam Kennedy, the
Angel second baseman whose explosion of three home runs in a game
helped propel his team to the World Series, grew up in Riverside. His
father is still a high school baseball coach here.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival, the Angels' daunting relief pitcher, went to nearby
Moreno Valley High. He owns a house in Riverside, and his mother,
Barbara, works at UC Riverside, where he played college ball.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Percival was a string bean -- 6 feet 2, 185 pounds. And
he was a catcher, though onlookers often chuckled that he returned
the ball faster than it was pitched in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Smitheran, UC Riverside's head baseball coach, who will begin
his 30th season on Feb. 1, recruited Percival out of Moreno Valley
High. Smitheran remembers one college game when a ball got past
Percival behind the plate. Percival scrambled back to get it, then
threw a bullet about 2 1/2 feet off the ground, from the backstop to
second base, nailing a runner who had dared try to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all proud of Dusty Baker and Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonds
and all the lineage there," Smitheran said. "But when it comes down
to it, with the people we have playing for the Angels, and the fact
that they are in our backyard -- this is Angels territory now."</TE>

<HD>Construction Firm Official Pleads Guilty in Kickback Plan</HD>
<DH>The scheme involved managers at TRW who passed extra costs
on to the government, prosecutors say.</DH>

<LD>A construction company executive has admitted authorizing kickbacks
to building managers at TRW's Redondo Beach facility so his firm
could pad expenses that were passed on to the federal government,
prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey W. Bochesa, 43, vice president of Bob Parrett Construction
Co. of Westminster, entered a guilty plea earlier this week in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va., to a charge of conspiring to
defraud the government.</LD>
<LD>   Bochesa managed day-to-day operations for Parrett, which had a
contract to maintain, repair and improve various Redondo Beach
facilities of TRW, a defense and aerospace contractor.</LD>
<TE>   The federal prosecutor's office said the construction company
overcharged TRW about $1.4 million from 1996 through 2000, most of
which was passed on to the National Reconnaissance Office, a U.S.
government intelligence organization with which TRW has a contract.</TE>
<TE>   Bochesa, who lives in Santa Ana, faces up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced Jan. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said he authorized the payment of about $160,000 in
kickbacks to five TRW employees through Marco A. Urrea, 36, a Parrett
project manager.</TE>
<TE>   Urrea pleaded guilty last month to conspiring to defraud the
government. He is to be sentenced Dec. 5.</TE>
<TE>   One TRW building manager, Jeffrey Zmina, pleaded guilty in May to
receiving about $77,000 in gratuities. He, too, is awaiting
sentencing. The four other TRW employees have not been named.</TE>
<TE>   Parrett company officials could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A TRW spokesman said the company is no longer on its list of
approved general contractors, but is completing a small number of
jobs under its prior contract for work at the South Bay facility.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman refused to disclose any information about the
identity or status of TRW employees implicated in the fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The case grew out of an investigation by the FBI, the Defense
Criminal Investigation Service and the inspector general of the
National Reconnaissance Office.</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls Want to Preserve Area's Feel</HD>
<DH>Candidates for proposed city's 5th council district are
seeking to protect equestrian lifestyle, but make government more
responsive to residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For candidates in the 5th district race for the proposed San Fernando
Valley city council, secession is as much about change as it is about
staying the same.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the seven candidates want a Valley city to bring a police
substation and more officers to the northeast Valley. Others say a
city government more accommodating to business is needed. Yet others
focus on plans to clean up blighted areas of the district, which
includes Sunland-Tujunga, Shadow Hills, Lake View Terrace, La Tuna
Canyon and parts of Sylmar, Pacoima and Sun Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to the northeast Valley's distinct lifestyle,
the candidates agree that things should remain just as they are.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to maintain the equestrian feel," said Richard W.
Kendall-Bell, whose La Tuna Canyon home is zoned for horses, although
he keeps only two rattlesnakes as pets. "That's the history of the
area and the people who live here want to preserve that."</TE>
<TE>   Valley voters will choose 14 council members and a mayor in the
Nov. 5 election. The offices will exist only if secession wins.</TE>
<TE>   Kendall-Bell, 44, believes that local town councils should be
allowed to spend 5% of the city's budget on neighborhood priorities,
such as parks, street paving and after-school programs. He also says
an independent Valley should contract with the Los Angeles Police
Department and try to increase the number of officers by 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a smaller, more responsive city that isn't run by
special-interest groups," said Kendall-Bell, who works for a company
that manages and develops out-of-state mobile home parks.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Kathy Anthony said she would push for a police
substation for Sunland-Tujunga, where she has lived for 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the very outskirts and for years, we've said it's like
we're the forgotten stepchild," said Anthony, who worked to get
Foothill Boulevard paved and to have landscaping planted along the
Foothill Freeway ramps on Sunland Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony, who once ran unsuccessfully for the Los Angeles City
Council, also wants to simplify the building permit process and lower
business taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the hardships of self-employment," said Anthony, 60, a
dressmaker who runs a Halloween store and a Christmas tree lot every
year. "We need to pay more attention to the businesses here and help
them stay in business."</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime activist, Al Dib, wants to tackle the neglected
areas that are marked by graffiti and bars on the windows.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not getting our fair share of services for our tax money --
I want to change that," said Dib, 68, a retired produce wholesaler
who has been nominated for the Fernando Award for community service
three times.</TE>
<TE>   Dib, a Sylmar resident, has waged several losing campaigns for the
Los Angeles City Council in the last three decades. He said he's been
knocking on doors two to four hours a day since early August.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think I've already held public office," he
quipped.</TE>
<TE>   A Sunland-Tujunga native, Ken McAlpine said he wants to phase out
the gross receipts tax. That would leave businesses with more money
to improve Foothill Boulevard, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you drive down Foothill Boulevard, you can tell when you
enter Glendale," said McAlpine, 34, who is working on updating
Disney's software system.</TE>
<TE>   He said a smaller government would be more accountable: "If
[secession] doesn't pass, next year we'll come back and do it again.
We'll keep doing it until we secede."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Bell of Shadow Hills -- he is not related to Kendall-Bell --
agrees that more must be done to attract and keep businesses in the
Valley. But he said his first priority on a Valley council would be a
smooth launch of the new government.</TE>
<TE>   "Our No. 1 priority is to build the new city services and create
management," said Bell, 43, an environmental health and safety
manager who lost a 1992 bid for the state Assembly. "We'll need
people at their desks with their sleeves rolled up."</TE>
<TE>   Bell also favors a contract arrangement with the LAPD and the Los
Angeles Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   John Blue Herget, 56, wants to preserve as much equestrian
property and open space as possible in the district. Instead of
suggesting his own solutions to the area's problems, Herget, who
lives in Lake View Terrace, said he would turn to a wide variety of
people.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts with recognizing the problem, then bringing in the best
possible minds and attacking it," said Herget, who works as a medic
on film crews. "This goes for the disappearing of the middle class,
runaway film production, closures of health clinics and the gang
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to open up the doors to new ideas."</TE>
<TE>   James J. Clancy, an attorney who has spent many years fighting
pornography, said a Valley city should have its own police and fire
departments. He also wants to require all municipal employees to live
in the city.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the La Tuna Canyon resident hopes to overhaul city
zoning.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get anything through the city without it taking a
couple of years," said Clancy, 80, an unsuccessful candidate for Los
Angeles city attorney in 1977. "We need to start from scratch."</TE>

<LD>A career criminal from Ventura County who has served time in prison
for rape and shooting a police officer now faces life in prison after
being convicted last week of stealing lip balm, breath spray and wine
from a grocery store.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Steven Herrera, 56, formerly of Santa Paula, was found
guilty in Santa Barbara Superior Court on Oct. 16 of commercial
burglary and petty theft with a prior conviction, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had charged him with stealing the items, valued at
$11.97, from a Vons store in Carpinteria on Jan. 5.</LD>
<TE>   Because the burglary marks his third felony conviction under the
state's three strikes law, Herrera faces the life term.</TE>
<TE>   His sentencing is scheduled in Santa Barbara on Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   At his most recent trial, Herrera's attorney argued that his
client has a brain defect that does not allow him to remember things.</TE>

<HD>Former College Chancellor's Deal Too Costly, Critics Charge</HD>
<DH>Settlement with the controversial Ventura County educator
is worth at least $215,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deal worth at least $215,000 struck with former community college
district Chancellor Philip Westin gives the deposed leader too much
money and prestige for all the damage he has caused, critics charged
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although many expressed relief that Westin's six-year tenure at
the district is over, they complained trustees were too generous in
agreeing to pay his $203,000 annual salary until July and $12,000 a
year in health benefits indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   From July 1 to Oct. 31 of next year, Westin can collect the
difference between his salary and any income he earns from other
employment. The board also gave him the title of chancellor emeritus,
a duty-free position he can retain until Nov. 1, 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it was a complete sellout," said trustee candidate Cheryl
Heitmann, who is seeking to replace Norman Nagel in the Nov. 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't negotiation, this was surrender."</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the settlement on a 3-2 vote. Trustees John
Tallman and Art Hernandez, each facing reelection next month, voted
against the settlement. Tallman said he could not justify giving
Westin what amounts to lifetime health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "To throw it out there to a guy with his record doesn't make any
sense," said Tallman, who added that many district employees work
extra years to become eligible for lifetime benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Westin will receive medical benefits for life
unless he gets a new job that offers him equal or better benefits,
said Nagel, the board president. With that in mind, Westin's benefits
could cost the district an additional $276,000 if he lives to age 80.</TE>
<TE>   The board had been seeking to buy out Westin's contract since
July, when the panel placed him on paid administrative leave in the
wake of revelations he had charged the district $119,000 over four
years for expenses related to his cars and computers and for
expensive meals.</TE>
<TE>   But an internal investigation found Westin had not broken any laws
or district rules, Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   The board will receive a final report on the investigation in
coming weeks, Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, did not believe the investigation was unbiased.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed to get rid of him, but their independent audit didn't
feel very objective to me," said Gerald Leavitt, one of two county
residents named as plaintiffs in the taxpayers' lawsuit pending in
Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   His opinion was echoed by others who said the audit was a sham
perpetrated by a board majority that wanted to let Westin off with a
sweet deal. The board could have fired Westin by showing he had
broken the law or violated district policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of cause to fire him," said Larry Miller,
president of the Ventura County Federation of College Teachers, which
pressed trustees to remove Westin. "But they would have spent more
money in court because his ego would not have allowed him to be fired
for cause."</TE>
<TE>   Tallman conceded the deal was probably the most inexpensive way to
close the door on Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "I have talked to a number of attorney friends, and they all agree
that firing for cause usually doesn't work," Tallman said. "What
happens is that within two years there's a change on the board and it
loses its enthusiasm to keep pushing, and pretty soon they settle."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics said they found it particularly offensive the title
chancellor emeritus was bestowed on Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think giving Westin a title and a gracious and generous way of
resigning is to accord him a respect that he did not deserve and that
he did not give to so many of his employees," said Martha Torgow, an
attorney for several district employees involved in lawsuits against
Westin.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said the board had to give Westin a title and position to
continue paying him medical benefits. "It's merely something to get
him through this period," Nagel said, adding that it's easier to find
a new job with a title and position.</TE>

<HD>Westin Deal Too Costly, Critics Charge</HD>
<DH>Opponents also say the settlement with the former college
chancellor gives him too much prestige. Officials defend their
actions.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A deal worth at least $215,000 struck with former community college
district Chancellor Philip Westin gives the deposed leader too much
money and prestige for all the damage he has caused, critics charged
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although many expressed relief that Westin's six-year tenure at
the district is over, they complained trustees were too generous in
agreeing to pay his $203,000 annual salary until July and $12,000 a
year in health benefits indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   From July 1 to Oct. 31 of next year, Westin can collect the
difference between his salary and any income he earns from other
employment. The board also gave him the title of chancellor emeritus,
a duty-free position he can retain until Nov. 1, 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it was a complete sellout," said trustee candidate Cheryl
Heitmann, who is seeking to replace Norman Nagel in the Nov. 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't negotiation, this was surrender."</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the settlement on a 3-2 vote. Trustees John
Tallman and Art Hernandez, each facing reelection next month, voted
against the settlement. Tallman said he could not justify giving
Westin what amounts to lifetime health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "To throw it out there to a guy with his record doesn't make any
sense," said Tallman, who added that many district employees work
extra years to become eligible for lifetime benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Westin will receive medical benefits for life
unless he gets a new job that offers him equal or better benefits,
said Nagel, the board president. With that in mind, Westin's benefits
could cost the district an additional $276,000 if he lives to age 80.</TE>
<TE>   The board had been seeking to buy out Westin's contract since
July, when the panel placed him on paid administrative leave in the
wake of revelations he had charged the district $119,000 over four
years for expenses related to his cars and computers and for
expensive meals.</TE>
<TE>   But an internal investigation found Westin had not broken any laws
or district rules, Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   The board will receive a final report on the investigation in
coming weeks, Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, did not believe the investigation was unbiased.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed to get rid of him, but their independent audit didn't
feel very objective to me," said Gerald Leavitt, one of two county
residents named as plaintiffs in the taxpayers' lawsuit pending in
Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   His opinion was echoed by others who said the audit was a sham
perpetrated by a board majority that wanted to let Westin off with a
sweet deal. The board could have fired Westin by showing he had
broken the law or violated district policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of cause to fire him," said Larry Miller,
president of the Ventura County Federation of College Teachers, which
pressed trustees to remove Westin. "But they would have spent more
money in court because his ego would not have allowed him to be fired
for cause."</TE>
<TE>   Tallman conceded the deal was probably the most inexpensive way to
close the door on Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "I have talked to a number of attorney friends, and they all agree
that firing for cause usually doesn't work," Tallman said. "What
happens is that within two years there's a change on the board and it
loses its enthusiasm to keep pushing, and pretty soon they settle."</TE>
<TE>   Leavitt and Miller were among those at Tuesday night's board
meeting who cheered when Nagel announced Westin had resigned and
gasped and hissed when told the details of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew for years this was a dysfunctional district, but I never
knew how dysfunctional," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics said they found it particularly offensive the title
chancellor emeritus was bestowed on Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think giving Westin a title and a gracious and generous way of
resigning is to accord him a respect that he did not deserve and that
he did not give to so many of his employees," said Martha Torgow, an
attorney for several district employees involved in lawsuits against
Westin.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said the board had to give Westin a title and position to
continue paying him medical benefits. "It's merely something to get
him through this period," Nagel said, adding that it's easier to find
a new job with a title and position. "It benefits Westin in seeking a
new job and benefits us in the sense that it gives him more incentive
to get a new position."</TE>
<TE>   Nagel, a staunch Westin supporter, and trustees Bob Gonzales and
Allan Jacobs voted to buy out Westin's contract, which would have
kept him as chancellor through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation found no wrongdoing," Nagel said.</TE>

<HD>3 Soldiers Hurt by Afghan Mine</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Three special forces soldiers were wounded when their vehicle hit a
land mine in western Afghanistan, the U.S. military said Wednesday.
One soldier's foot was later amputated.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers hit the mine Tuesday north of Farah, a provincial
capital, said a U.S. military spokesman, Col. Roger King. He would
not say whether they were Americans.</LD>
<LD>   However, in New Zealand the defense force chief, Air Marshal Bruce
Ferguson, said three New Zealand commandos were seriously wounded in
a land mine explosion in Afghanistan. The two reports appeared to
refer to the same incident, but King refused to confirm the
nationality of the injured troops.</LD>
<TE>   One victim's foot was amputated by U.S. medical staff, King said.
The other two victims were injured by shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, several rockets or mortars were fired at a U.S.
base near Asadabad in eastern Afghanistan. They were fired from west
of the base but missed by at least half a mile, King said. The base
called in A-10 close air support planes, but they were unable to find
the attackers.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's Underdog Runs Alone</HD>
<DH>Ruling-party candidate for president Jose Serra is trying
to be all things to the voters, but his leftist opponent only pulls
further ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar and Paula Gobbi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>RIO DE JANEIRO -- Trailing badly in the polls and suffering from an
image problem he can't seem to shake, an increasingly isolated Jose
Serra is trying a bit of everything in his bid to become Brazil's
next president.</LD>
<LD>   A lifelong centrist and technocrat, the ruling-party candidate has
sought in recent days to portray himself as an anti-establishment
leftist. At the same time, he has clung to the mantle of the
incumbent center-right alliance, portraying himself as the candidate
of the status quo.</LD>
<LD>   In television ads and interviews, he hints darkly that his
challenger in Sunday's runoff vote, the leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva, could take Brazil down the path of Argentina, South America's
economic basket case, or Venezuela, run by the idiosyncratic populist
Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<TE>   "I am afraid," actress Regina Duarte says in one Serra ad,
adopting the same melodramatic tone that made her famous in dozens of
soap operas. "Afraid of losing all the stability we have fought so
hard to achieve. We can't throw everything into the garbage."</TE>
<TE>   None of this, however, seems to have had much of an impact on
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Polls in recent days show Serra losing ground to Lula. Unless
Serra's fortunes improve quickly, a Lula landslide is possible. One
poll last week showed Lula, of the Workers' Party, leading Serra, of
the Social Democratic Party of Brazil, 66% to 34%; another had the
race only slightly tighter: 64% to 36%.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round of balloting Oct. 6, Lula got about 20 million
more votes than Serra, winning 46% to Serra's 23%. Now, Serra must
not only win over undecided voters but also persuade some voters
leaning toward Lula to switch, said Luiz Lourenco, a political
scientist at the University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   "Serra needs to be the anti-Lula," Lourenco said. "That is why
Serra needs to run a negative campaign."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, with about 11 million of Brazil's 174 million
people out of work and the economy tumbling, citizens are ready for a
change from the pro-market reforms of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who handpicked Serra as his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in response to the dipping value of the country's
currency, the Central Bank of Brazil raised interest rates by 3
percentage points -- a move that was widely unpopular here. Brazil
already has one of the world's highest interest rates. Cardoso
defended the move.</TE>
<TE>   Serra has tried, unconvincingly to many, to persuade people that
he will be different from his mentor, who is prevented by term limits
from seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the candidate who is more to the left," he said in an
interview last week, making a reference to his own days as a radical
student leader, "who would bring more change, who would fight the
vested interests."</TE>
<TE>   Compounding Serra's difficulties is his failure to secure the two
most important endorsements of the runoff campaign, those of the
third- and fourth-place finishers eliminated in the first round:
Anthony Garotinho (who took 18%) and Ciro Gomes (who took 12%). Both
have announced that they will support Lula.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil's media, the competing campaigns offer contrasting
images of success and distress, analyst Fatima Pacheco Jordao of the
daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula is always surrounded by many people, leading big rallies and
demonstrations all over the country," she said. "With Serra, it's the
opposite. He presents himself as a solitary candidate, always
arriving alone to his events. There is no joy in his campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Serra has excoriated Lula for agreeing to only one television
debate and has attacked Workers' Party administrations for cutting
back social programs in the states and cities they control.</TE>
<TE>   Now some Lula supporters are firing back. The daughter of the
actress in the "I am afraid" Serra commercial lashed out at her
mother, saying she was "ashamed" anyone would use fear to influence
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Lula himself has started responding to Serra's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent seems to have lost his sensitivity, that air he had
of being a nice guy," Lula remarked last week. "Every day his
campaign descends to a lower level The more he lowers his level, the
more we are going to raise ours."</TE>

Minsk, where he planned to attend a conference.</LD>

<LD>The European Parliament awarded the European Union's top human rights
prize to Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya, chief promoter of a reform
initiative in the Communist nation.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, known as the Varela Project, became the most
serious internal political challenge to date faced by Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.</LD>
<LD>   It resulted in May in a petition for a referendum on political
reforms, such as freedom of expression and an amnesty for political
prisoners. Castro, in power since a 1959 revolution, has so far only
responded to the petition by saying it would get a response "in due
course."</LD>

<HD>2 Colombian Soldiers Sanctioned for Bombing</HD>
<DH>A pilot and crewman are the first to be found guilty in the
1998 attack in which a U.S.-made device was dropped, killing 18
villagers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOGOTA, Colombia -- A Colombian helicopter pilot and crewman have
been sanctioned for dropping a U.S.-made cluster bomb on a small
Colombian town nearly four years ago, killing 18 villagers in a
military operation that allegedly involved two private American
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Cesar Romero and crewman Hector Mario Hernandez
intentionally dropped a bomb on Santo Domingo on Dec. 13, 1998, amid
a heated battle near the town between guerrillas and the Colombian
army, according to a report of a finding this month by the Colombian
attorney general's office obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, arrived at in an administrative hearing similar to an
internal affairs investigation, marks the first time that anyone has
been found responsible for the incident, which left seven children
and 11 adults dead.</LD>
<TE>   The finding, which has not been made public, is subject to appeal.
Romero could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Hernandez denied
involvement. "I had nothing to do with this," he said in a brief
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   The two men were suspended for three months from active military
duty, the maximum possible penalty permitted under the administrative
code in effect at the time of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They made no distinctions as to whom they were attacking," said a
lawyer in the attorney general's office, who did not want to be
identified because of security concerns. "The men violated
international humanitarian law."</TE>
<TE>   Two other men accused in the case, co-pilot Johan Jimenez and Army
Maj. Juan Manuel Gonzalez, who was accused of failing to stop looting
in the town during the battle, were absolved of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups and Democrats in the U.S. Congress regard the
Santo Domingo bombing as a test case for the Colombian military,
which in the past has been reluctant to pursue charges against its
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, they welcomed news of the attorney general's
decision but assailed the Colombian military for what they regard as
its continuing efforts to impede the investigation. A separate
military inquiry into the bombing has stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian Air Force Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco has maintained that
those killed in Santo Domingo were victims of a car bomb planted in
the town by guerrillas. Velasco did not respond to attempts to reach
him Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the foreign operations
subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, threatened Wednesday to
hold back a portion of U.S. aid to Colombia unless the military takes
action in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has proposed sending $673 million in aid to Colombia in
fiscal 2003, much of it to help the Colombian military combat the
leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitaries warring for control of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "If justice is not done, the Congress should withhold aid to the
Colombian air force," said Leahy, who has closely followed the case.
"There has to be a consequence for killing 18 innocent people and
lying about it."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups said that the Colombian government must do
more to investigate the incident. They also criticized the military's
inquiry, saying the incident should be investigated by civilian
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't reflect due process, especially for the victims and
surviving family members," said Robin Kirk, Colombia expert for New
York-based Human Rights Watch. "This case should be tried in a
civilian court to reveal what really happened."</TE>
<TE>   After a Times story about the incident was published in March,
Northwestern University's Center for International Human Rights filed
a petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in
Washington against the Colombian government, alleging that it had
failed to fully investigate the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The Santo Domingo incident began when U.S. Customs planes helped
the Colombian military detect a private aircraft suspected of
engaging in an arms-for-drugs deal involving the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Colombia's largest rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting confrontation between the Colombian military and the
rebels evolved into a battle that raged only 1,000 yards from Santo
Domingo. With its soldiers pinned down, the Colombian army requested
air support.</TE>
<TE>   Romero and his crew responded by using their Huey helicopter and a
crude bombing mechanism to drop a World War II-era AN-M41 cluster
bomb in the middle of the town, according to the attorney general's
finding. The pilots have maintained in sworn statements that they
dropped the bomb outside of town.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier Times report found that military and court records
show that Romero's helicopter and other military units involved in
the operation were given food, supplies and logistical support by Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., which operates an oil
complex and pipeline 30 miles north of Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   The records also indicate that a second U.S. company,
Florida-based AirScan Inc., participated in the bombing, helping plan
the operation and providing targeting information. AirScan had
previously been under contract with Occidental to help patrol the
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental officials declined to comment Wednesday on the finding.
In the past, they have said they were unable to confirm or deny their
involvement in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan officials did not return a phone call Wednesday.
Previously, they have denied that their aircraft was used for
anything but pipeline patrols.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating whether an active-duty Coast
Guard pilot was flying an AirScan plane that flew alongside Romero's
helicopter during the bombing. The Coast Guard did not respond to
requests for an update on the investigation Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's finding made no mention of the alleged
American role in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy rebuffed an attempt by the attorney general's
office to locate AirScan employees to testify as witnesses in the
case, according to e-mails obtained by The Times this summer through
a Freedom of Information Act request.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lays Its Iraqi Cards on the Table</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>These are some of the main points of a draft resolution on Iraq that
the United States presented Wednesday to the other 14 members of the
U.N. Security Council:</LD>
<LD>   Iraq is still, and has been for a number of years, in material
breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions, in particular
through its failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The Security Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face
serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its
obligations.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq is to accept the terms of the resolution within seven days
and to declare its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction
within 30 days. "False statements or omissions" from the list would
not automatically constitute a breach, as in earlier drafts, unless
accompanied by failure to cooperate with inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors would have 45 days from the adoption of the resolution
to resume work and would report back to the council 60 days after the
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors must be allowed to search for weapons anywhere at
any time they choose, including "immediate, unimpeded, unconditional
and unrestricted access to presidential sites."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution retains a much-debated point about taking Iraqi
scientists and family members out of the country for interviews to
reduce intimidation by the government. It says inspectors have the
right to the names of all personnel associated with Iraq's chemical,
biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</TE>
<TE>   The draft would also give inspectors the right to freeze Iraqi
movement in "no-drive and no-fly zones" around inspection sites to
ensure that material isn't spirited away. But the new text dropped a
controversial demand that armed guards accompany inspectors and
enforce the zones.</TE>
<TE>   The new draft also drops a proposal that the five permanent
Security Council members be allowed to join inspection teams to guide
them to suspect sites and receive information gleaned from
inspections, a provision that seemed to some to set up espionage. The
text does allow the chief weapons inspectors to determine their own
teams, which would not preclude them from selecting experts armed
with intelligence from their home countries.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors would have the right to seize and export any equipment,
materials or documents taken during inspections, without search of
themselves or of their baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq could not take hostile action or threaten such against any
representatives or personnel of the United Nations or of any member
state taking action to uphold any Security Council resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. would consult the Security Council about what sort of
consequences Baghdad should face if inspectors reported that Iraq had
failed to cooperate. But the U.S. emphasized that it would not have
to wait for U.N. approval before taking military action.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Pakistan Massacre Is Released</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A man who survived a massacre at a Christian charity and was tagged a
suspect has been freed but remains under surveillance, police said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Robin Peeranditta, an office assistant at the Institute of Peace
and Justice, was officially arrested Tuesday but released later the
same evening, said a senior police official. Peeranditta has not been
charged.</LD>
<LD>   "He will remain under observation for some days to check who is
coming to meet him," the Pakistani official said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Peeranditta had been in police detention since eight of his
colleagues were shot execution-style Sept. 25. Seven died, and the
eighth lies in a coma in the hospital. Peeranditta was apparently
beaten up but not shot.</TE>
<TE>   Police have had questions about Peeranditta's role from the
beginning, after he gave conflicting accounts of the killings. He
initially told police that two men were involved, then changed that
to four, and finally settled on three attackers.</TE>
<TE>   The massacre had been just one of a long list of violent attacks
against Christians and Westerners since Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf allied his country with Washington in the war against
terrorism and cracked down on Islamic extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan contends there is no evidence Islamic militants were
involved in the office killings, instead strongly hinting that
neighboring India, particularly its spy agency, was responsible.</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Suspect Is Said to Be Central to Terrorist Cell</HD>
<DH>Ramzi Binalshibh was secretive but always in the know about
the German group's activities, states an alleged member on trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terry McDermott and Dirk Laabs Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HAMBURG, Germany -- Ramzi Binalshibh, a young, apparently rootless
drifter from Yemen, was described in court testimony Wednesday as a
man who seemed to be in the middle of everything the members of
Hamburg's Sept. 11 terrorist cell did.</LD>
<LD>   Binalshibh, who was captured last month in Pakistan and is in U.S.
custody, has emerged in recent months as a central figure in the
Hamburg cell that produced three of the suicide pilots for the
Sept.11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Binalshibh described
himself in an interview before his capture as a coordinator of the
attacks. U.S. intelligence officials have said that description seems
to conform to information they have been gathering about him, and it
was reinforced in testimony here Wednesday by Mounir Motassadeq.</LD>
<LD>   Motassadeq, a 28-year-old Moroccan electrical engineer, is on
trial accused of aiding and abetting the murder of more than 3,000
people. He is the first person accused of direct involvement in the
Sept. 11 attacks to go on trial anywhere. In the trial's second day,
he continued to disclaim any prior knowledge of the September attacks
but provided fresh insight into men accused of carrying them out.
"Binalshibh was somebody who never had a fixed abode," Motassadeq
said. "You never knew where he was or what he did."</LD>
<TE>   Binalshibh was secretive about his own activities, but he always
knew what the other men in the small group of Hamburg Islamists were
doing, when they traveled and where they went, and what they needed
to have done, Motassadeq said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Binalshibh once asked Motassadeq to call the
girlfriend of Ziad Jarrah, one of the hijackers, and tell her Jarrah
had gone to Chechnya. Jarrah was actually en route to Afghanistan,
Binalshibh told Motassadeq.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Motassadeq was part of the Hamburg cell,
providing logistical and financial assistance. One of the primary
pieces of evidence is a wire transfer of money Motassadeq helped
arrange from Hamburg to the United States when the suicide pilots
were in flight school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the pilots, Marwan Al-Shehhi, had granted Motassadeq power
of attorney over his bank accounts when he was preparing to leave
Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   "One day, I was called up," Motassadeq testified. "A voice said in
Arabic: 'Turn to fax! Fax! Fax!' " He then received a handwritten fax
from Binalshibh. The fax said: "Dear brother Mounir, please transfer
the sum of 5,000 marks from Al-Shehhi's account to the following bank
account .... Marwan needs money."</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he thought the fax came from Yemen and that he
recognized Binalshibh's handwriting. He said he thought that
Al-Shehhi was in Afghanistan at the time. "I just did it for Marwan,
that's all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq's lawyers said it was actually Binalshibh who sent the
money to Al-Shehhi in Florida. The defendant said he thought he first
met Binalshibh in late 1996 or 1997, when Binalshibh was enrolled at
college in Wismar, a German town on the Baltic Sea. Motassadeq said
he never saw Binalshibh study and that he didn't stay long at the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq said he probably met Binalshibh through Mohammed bin
Naser Belfas, a man much respected by young fundamentalists in the
Hamburg Muslim community. Binalshibh lived with Belfas often,
Motassadeq said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Motassadeq's actions were not innocent.
They said Motassadeq used his power of attorney over Al-Shehhi's
accounts to provide cover for the hijacker, to make it seem as though
Al-Shehhi was still in Hamburg when he was instead in Al Qaeda camps
in Afghanistan. He paid bills in Al-Shehhi's name, and canceled a
mobile-phone contract and an apartment lease by signing Al-Shehhi's
name to a letter.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like you wanted to show the man is still in the
country," said the judge, Albrecht Mentz. Motassadeq said he was
simply doing a friend a favor.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant added that he didn't know where Binalshibh, who left
Germany for Pakistan in early September 2001, went. He never heard
from him again. He said he thought Binalshibh would have gone to
Afghanistan, just as he thought Al-Shehhi had.</TE>

<HD>Rebels Hold Hundreds in Moscow</HD>
<DH>Militants seize a theater in mid-performance. They demand

<LD>MOSCOW -- In a meticulously planned terrorist strike that brought the
war in Chechnya into the heart of Russia's capital, as many as 50
armed men and women took over a theater in mid-performance Wednesday
night and held about 650 people hostage, threatening to kill them if
police rushed the building.</LD>
<LD>   The masked attackers, who were clad in camouflage and described by
witnesses as Chechens laden with weapons and explosives, demanded an
immediate end to Russia's war against separatist rebels in their
republic.</LD>
<LD>   Coming as the war seemed to have settled into an ugly, deadly
standoff, the seizure during a performance of the Russian musical
romance "Nord-Ost" represented the guerrillas' boldest challenge yet
to the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<TE>   He called off a trip to Germany and Portugal because of the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came only a few weeks after the third anniversary of
Russian troops' reentry into Chechnya, the breakaway republic in the
northern Caucasus that had gained de facto independence from the
Russian federation after a war for independence in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of police and special forces surrounded the Soviet-era
theater in Taganka Square and set up a command post.</TE>
<TE>   As the night turned to gray this morning, the situation seemed
little changed. Police said that the militants had released 41 people
since taking over the theater. One of the last was Olga Treiman. The
18-year-old, nearly eight months pregnant, was let go around 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   A refreshment stand worker at the theater who had managed to hide
in a bathroom for nearly two hours before being found by the armed
militants, Treiman said she was given a haunting message by her guard
just before he released her:</TE>
<TE>   "My name is Aslam," he said, according to her. "My people are
being killed by the dozen every day in Chechnya. We know we are not
going back -- we will die here. But we will die with all these
hostages if they don't stop the killing in Chechnya and pull the
troops out.... If not, we will all die together. We are ready to die.
We will be happy to."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate identification of the attackers from
authorities. However, Aslambek Aslakhanov, a Chechen representative
in the lower house of parliament, said his sources had identified the
leader as Movsar Barayev. His uncle, Arbi, was a warlord who gained
notoriety as a kidnapper and trader in Russian captives in Chechnya
until he was killed last year.</TE>
<TE>   The hostage-takers "have just one demand -- to immediately pull
out Russian troops from Chechnya," said another member of parliament,
Vyacheslav Igrunov. "Of course, no one can fulfill this demand. But
we are ready to talk and talk and talk to save people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Igrunov estimated that the Chechens could hold out for days
because there are food and drinks in the hall.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrilla action erupted at the beginning of the second act of
"Nord-Ost" -- "North-East" in German -- which has played to full
houses for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was enjoying the show when some people jumped on the stage
dressed in camouflage uniforms and wearing black masks," said Alexei
Ryabov, who was attending the performance with his mother as a
present on the eve of his 14th birthday. "One shot in the air with
what looked like a Kalashnikov.</TE>
<TE>   "He shot into the air again and screamed, 'We are at war here!
This is war!' He looked just like the Chechens [fighters] that we see
on television," Alexei said. "Everyone began screaming and jumping
around, and they began shooting into the air again."</TE>
<TE>   The boy said he saw about 30 armed men and women. Police placed
the number of attackers at between 40 and 50. Among themselves they
spoke a Caucasian language that Alexei said he could not understand.
But when they barked out orders to the crowd, it was in Russian.</TE>
<TE>   "Then [the gunman] said, 'Are there Georgians in the audience?
Stand up. And little children? You can go,' " the boy said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei was among about 18 children and about a dozen ethnic
Georgians or other nationalities from the Caucasus who were allowed
to leave the theater. As he filed out, forced to leave his mother
behind, he could see the armed militants laying down cables in the
hall and across the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "They said we have a bomb here and the hall is now mined," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another person lucky to get away was cast member Ratyom Nikolayev,
a 23-year-old actor who plays the father of the main character in Act
1 and then joins the chorus in Act 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I was standing in the wings, waiting for my entrance, when I
heard shots on the stage," he said. "And then I heard this accented
voice saying, "It's war!' "</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the seven cast members on the stage were taken
hostage and forced to sit with the audience, he said. Nikolayev and
other cast members ran upstairs to a third-floor costume room.</TE>
<TE>   There they grabbed their belongings and started toward the stage
door but turned back when they realized that the guerrillas were
there. Instead, they retreated to the costume room and bolted
themselves in.</TE>
<TE>   The actors took costumes and other fabrics and fashioned a rope to
climb down to a side street.</TE>
<TE>   "As we were fleeing, I heard a grenade go off," Nikolayev said. "I
am a lifelong Muscovite. Never in my life could I imagine the war
would come so close to me."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives, summoned by telephone calls from those inside the hall,
milled about in confusion as police and special forces troops poured
in, making preparations in case they received an order to storm the
building.</TE>
<TE>   Truckloads of elite special forces drew up outside the building
along with several armored personnel carriers. A crane and a
bulldozer, at least four firetrucks and ambulances also were deployed
to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Veterans Hospital No. 1, only about 300 yards from
the theater, was being evacuated in what seemed another sign that
authorities feared there could be casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei's mother, Alexandra Ryabova, 32, spoke by cell phone from
inside the theater with her ex-husband, Dmitri. As a Times reporter
stood by, Ryabova could be heard clearly sobbing hopelessly into the
phone:</TE>
<TE>   "Dima, Dima, it is very, very serious," she wept. "I don't know if
I will survive this horror.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything happens to me," she pleaded, still weeping, "take
care of my son."</TE>
<TE>   About 12:45 a.m., Aslakhanov, the Chechen representative in
parliament, said he wished to enter the building to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   "I am ready to give my life in order to spare the lives of the
people. I don't want anyone to suffer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities barred him from going inside, but negotiations
appeared to have begun later. Austrian Ambassador Franz Cede told
reporters in a television interview that he was hopeful for the
release of 24 Westerners believed to be inside, including one
American.</TE>
<TE>   The police and troops were about 150 yards from the theater,
driven back by sporadic rounds of gunfire from inside.</TE>
<TE>   A man with the first name Pavel, who asked that neither he nor his
wife be further identified, was getting updates by cell phone from
his wife inside. According to her, the armed militants had ordered
the audience to move in close to the stage and they had started to
beat some.</TE>
<TE>   "I see blood on the floor between the chairs," she told him,
according to Pavel. "They said, 'We will treat you as you treated us
in 1944,' " the year Chechens were brutally relocated to Kazakhstan
by orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin. At that time, tens of
thousands of Chechens died of cold and starvation.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the attack was taking place, some members of Moscow's
large Caucasian minority were worried that they would suffer for it.</TE>
<TE>   "My business is done for," said Mohammed, a theatergoer from
Dagestan who was among those released after he convinced the
hostage-takers that he was an ethnic Georgian. "People from the
Caucasus might as well leave Moscow as soon as possible. We won't be
able to work here any longer. Damn this war. And damn these Chechen
bandits."</TE>

<HD>Alleged Defector Back on U.S. Radar Screen</HD>
<DH>Tokyo is said to be seeking a pardon for an American so he
and his Japanese wife can leave North Korea, which abducted her in
1978.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Is he a defector, an aging movie star, a loving husband or
all of the above? Inquiring minds at the Pentagon would like to know
about Charles Robert Jenkins, who has been in North Korea for more
than three decades after allegedly defecting from the U.S. Army.</LD>
<LD>   They'd also like to learn about his reclusive host's nuclear and
security programs and the existence of other Americans in North
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the world may get a chance to ask him. According to a
report by the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun on Wednesday, Tokyo
has asked Washington to grant a special pardon so that the former
soldier and his wife can come and live in Japan. But Jenkins first
wants to make sure that he won't be thrown into jail for years.</LD>
<TE>   Jenkins' wife, 43-year-old Hitomi Soga, one of at least 13
Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea, is in Japan this week
visiting relatives. But a permanent return could hinge on her
husband's status with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, said the Japanese
government "has brought the matter to our attention." He said he
could not confirm that a pardon request had been made.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing to remember here is that Mr. Jenkins is a
deserter and that is a crime," Davis said. "I wouldn't want to
speculate on what might happen to him."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese government officials declined to confirm that they are
pushing Jenkins' case.</TE>
<TE>   "Jenkins is in a difficult position because if he's allowed to
come to Japan, the U.S. will definitely want him returned," said
Hajime Izumi, professor of Korean studies at Shizuoka University.
"And if that happens, it would be difficult for the Soga family to
return to Japan as well. That's why the Japanese government is asking
the U.S. to pardon him."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins' brother-in-law, Lee Harrel, reached by telephone in North
Carolina, said Japan's involvement was welcome. "I think we're moving
in the right direction," he said. "But I'm just waiting to see what
goes on."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say, however, that they doubt Washington will let the
former sergeant off the hook because it is loath to set a precedent.
There are at least three other suspected U.S. Army defectors in North
Korea -- Pvts. Larry A. Abshier and James Dresnok and Spc. Jerry
Wayne Parrish.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, 62, of Rich Square, N.C., population 1,000, said a week
ago that he would "like to visit Japan, but it's not easy," according
to Japanese officials. They saw him at North Korea's Pyongyang
International Airport, they say, as he and his two daughters saw off
his wife, one of five abductees allowed to visit Japan. North Korean
officials say the other eight abductees have died.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, who was based in South Korea, went missing Jan. 5, 1965,
while on patrol about six miles from the village of Panmunjom near
the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. Officials in
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, announced three weeks later that
he had defected. Some U.S. MIA groups are skeptical, however,
pointing out that defection reports from North Korea are notoriously
untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see him have a chance to give his side of the story,"
said Dolores Apodaca-Alfond, chairperson of the National Alliance of
Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen. "If he has
to pay something, OK, but so much has happened, and it's been so long
now."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins has been largely out of the public eye for the last three
decades, with the exception of an appearance in the North Korean
propaganda movie "Unknown Hero," which chronicled the 1950-53 Korean
War from Pyongyang's perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, Abshier and Dresnok were identified in the 20-part
black-and-white series playing U.S. counterintelligence and policy
planners.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike her husband's case, there's no question that Soga's border
crossing was involuntary. Soga, still a teenager at the time, was out
shopping for groceries with her mother the evening of Aug. 12, 1978.
Suddenly, three men jumped them from behind, dragged them under a
large tree and stuffed them into bags, according to a Japanese
fact-finding team.</TE>
<TE>   Soga and her mother were placed on a small boat and transferred at
sea to a larger vessel. She never saw her mother again.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in North Korea, Soga underwent obligatory training
in the Korean language and North Korea's customs and ideology.
Eventually, she started studying English. Her teacher was Jenkins,
and they were married in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstances of their meeting are simply eerie," the Asahi
Shimbun newspaper said Monday. "But Jenkins now thanks his wife for
making him a family man, and Soga says she is happy."</TE>
<TE>   As Soga and her fellow abductees have become reacquainted with
Japan over the last week, they have had to weigh the tug of family
members back in North Korea against the freedom but wrenching culture
change of life outside -- assuming that Pyongyang lets them go. All
five have children in North Korea, who, some of their relatives
contend, are essentially hostages, thus ensuring that their parents
return.</TE>
<TE>   Settling the abduction issue has been a first step to normalizing
relations between Japan and North Korea, which have had volatile ties
since Tokyo's brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to
1945. North Korea is also keen to secure billions of dollars from
Tokyo in reparations for the occupation and World War II. But news
last week that North Korea has a nuclear weapons program has
complicated negotiations and raised fears that Pyongyang will use the
abductees for political leverage.</TE>
<TE>   The five abductees have been relatively mum in public. However,
Soga returned with several photographs of life in the North and has
described to friends and relatives her life as a happy homemaker,
North Korean-style. She gets up at 6 a.m., makes lunches for her
college-student daughters, eats toast and coffee with her husband and
prepares rice-based lunches and dinners for the family.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins told Japanese officials at the Pyongyang airport on Oct.
15 that he and Soga have created a life together, despite the age
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitomi is almost 20 years younger than me, but she made us a very
good family," he reportedly said, through a Korean interpreter. "I do
appreciate her for that, even though she may have felt lonely
marrying a man this much older."</TE>
<TE>   Soga has told relatives that their oldest daughter, Mika, 19, has
more of her father's Caucasian features, while Belinda, 17, resembles
her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon says it is interested in Jenkins, given his role in
propaganda films and his bid to persuade other U.S. soldiers to cross
over. And State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said last week
that the U.S. wanted to talk to Jenkins largely about whether he
knows of other Americans in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance for missing American servicemen contends that
military officials have largely refused to even consider that Jenkins
and a handful of other Americans may have been kidnapped. They cite a
1962 North Korean intelligence report that outlines the need to
abduct Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Did Jenkins walk across the DMZ to North Korea or was he
kidnapped, like his future wife and other Japanese citizens," the
group said on its Web site. "Until [he] can be questioned, on neutral
ground, we must give the benefit of the doubt to the serviceman."</TE>

<KH>IN TWO WORLDS</KH>
<HD>Delivering on a Friendship to Make Sure Mail Gets Through</HD>
<DH>A Palestinian courier relies heavily on a Samaritan and his
special status.</DH>
<SE>First in an occasional series of stories about Israelis and
Palestinians who defy divisions.</SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NABLUS, West Bank -- Fadi Touqan, blue-eyed and 25 years old, scans
Rafidia Street. No tanks. The coast is clear. He dashes to his
office, furls the metal gates and once again is in business. Briefly.</LD>
<LD>   Fadi is the DHL man in Nablus. He defies the odds of military
blockade and shoot-to-kill curfews to run the international courier
service in this West Bank city, delivering and receiving envelopes,
packages and other special mail -- a lifeline for many Palestinians
who need money, medicine, bank drafts and passports.</LD>
<LD>   He couldn't do it without the help of a good Samaritan. Literally.</LD>
<TE>   The Samaritan is Yaakov Mrhiv, a member of an ancient people who
claim to descend from tribes that populated the northern part of the
kingdom of Israel nearly 3,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Half the world's 650 remaining Samaritans live today in Mt.
Gerizim, their ancestral village on a hill above Nablus, where they
celebrate Passover and heed the Torah, but speak Arabic and have both
Israeli and Palestinian nationality. Fadi and Yaakov are friends from
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Because Yaakov is a Samaritan, he enjoys the privilege -- unique
in this land these days -- of being able to move freely inside
Israel, inside Palestinian territory, and in between the two.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, Israelis and Palestinians have been
locked in a death grip, a conflict that has ravaged the two societies
and driven them further apart than at any time in their recent
history.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a rare handful of people reach over the barriers and across
the divides, finding common ground or common cause, for reasons that
are sometimes political and ideological, and sometimes simply
pragmatic. Their lonely, largely unheralded efforts are exceptions in
a world steeped ever more in hatred and mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   Fadi and Yaakov have teamed in a kind of relay race against the
rigors of the war that surrounds and entraps them.</TE>
<TE>   Because a Palestinian state does not exist, DHL must work through
Israel. Packages from the Palestinian territories that arrive at the
Israeli airport are separated and given an extra security check.</TE>
<TE>   Gliding through Israeli army checkpoints virtually unchallenged,
Yaakov can travel to Jerusalem, where he picks up deliveries at a
main DHL office. He ferries the shipment back to Mt. Gerizim and,
when it's safe, jaunts down to Nablus where Fadi awaits.</TE>
<TE>   Business, of course, is not what it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   From Israel and within the West Bank or Gaza Strip, same-day
delivery has stretched to three days. An envelope on Fadi's desk
during a recent visit had traveled from Sri Lanka to Tel Aviv, 3,400
miles, in three days -- and then taken an additional week to get to
Nablus from Tel Aviv, 30 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The address said:</TE>
<TE>   "Nablus, Palestine. Nablus, Israel. Nablus, Palestine, Via
Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Another envelope from Guatemala took 28 days to reach Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not exactly express mail," Fadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Israeli forces reoccupied the West Bank last spring and put
most of the population under virtual house arrest, Fadi can open the
office only occasionally, and then for just a few hours. Deliveries
are haphazard and depend on luck, especially for mail destined to
outlying villages.</TE>
<TE>   His compact DHL truck, with the company's maroon-colored logo, got
stuck in Jenin. He was making a pickup there when an Israeli army
invasion suddenly closed the road. And while he could return to
Nablus over a circuitous route, he had to leave the vehicle behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very, very difficult," Fadi said. Even when deliveries
get through, rising costs put the service out of reach for many
Palestinians. "It's become very expensive for Palestinians. They need
to eat, not send packages."</TE>
<TE>   His disheveled office is decorated with DHL posters in Hebrew and
English: "For you, we always go the distance" and "The team is you"
-- and one with a verse from the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, some people tried to get supplies and mail in and out
of Nablus using donkeys. But Fadi turned to his friend the Samaritan,
whose people have been traversing and doing business in these hills
for millenniums.</TE>
<TE>   "I trust Yaakov," Fadi said. "I know him from before."</TE>
<TE>   And Yaakov, whose job as a contractor securing Palestinian labor
for Israeli construction crews has completely dried up, says he's
glad to help, even if he risks getting shot every time he drives from
Nablus to Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it is my duty to help him in his work," said Yaakov, 27.
"Of course, there's money in it for me, too. But I can't take a large
amount from him. Fadi is my friend."</TE>
<TE>   Yaakov has a few tricks for the road, which has been a venue for
ambushes of Jews by Palestinians, and of Palestinians by Jewish
settlers. His car's license plates are Israeli -- yellow. But to ward
off a Palestinian sniper's bullets, he flashes his lights and honks
his horn at particularly dangerous points, like a secret handshake.</TE>
<TE>   And when he approaches Israeli army checkpoints, he will call out
his window, "Samaritan!" It clears the way.</TE>
<TE>   Few people straddle two worlds the way the Samaritans do. Not
exactly Jewish, not exactly Arab, they typically speak Hebrew as
readily as Arabic, and many will have a Hebrew and an Arabic name.
While Yaakov's father's Arabic is stronger, Yaakov clearly prefers
Hebrew -- and he looks like a wannabe Israeli with close-cropped
hair, sunglasses on top of his head and baggy shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jews, the Samaritans observe the Sabbath from Friday sundown
to Saturday sundown, celebrate Passover and revere a Torah written in
an ancient form of Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   The community has dwindled from 1.2 million 17 centuries ago to
just hundreds today. Those Samaritans who don't live on Mt. Gerizim
live in the Israeli city of Holon, a suburb of Tel Aviv. There are
more males than females, and it is becoming harder for Samaritans to
find mates.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers aside, their survival depends on a chameleon-like ability
to accommodate. Although the Samaritan high priest sits on the
Palestinian Legislative Council, Samaritans as a whole avoid politics
and pay allegiance to whoever is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   At Yaakov's family home, his father, Yitzhak, greets visitors by
donning his traditional loose-fitting robe and red-and-white fez. He
proudly shows off the handwritten Torahs in elaborate ancient-style
script that women may not touch.</TE>
<TE>   "The community's existence depends on good relations with the
people who rule them," Yitzhak, 63, said as his 80-year-old mother
served sweet juice. Whether it's the Ottoman sultans or the Hashemite
kings of Jordan or Israel or the Palestinian Authority, it's all the
same, more or less. Lately, they are caught in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Samaritans had to leave the center of Nablus during the first
intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s, he said, because militant
Palestinian youths thought that they were Jews and harassed them. And
Israeli soldiers often view them with suspicion because they help
Palestinians with rides and supplies, Yitzhak said.</TE>
<TE>   The Samaritans are so reluctant to get into politics that when the
head of the community discovered that a reporter was in town without
checking in with him first, he proffered a friendly greeting -- then
threatened to sue if anything political was written.</TE>
<TE>   But this is the Middle East, and politics are everywhere. Even the
Samaritans do not escape the ravages of conflict and occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Mt. Gerizim have about had it with the Israeli tanks
that charge through, leaving their streets a pulverized mess.</TE>
<TE>   "You go abroad and everything looks nice with clean streets, and
you come here and see all this damage and you think this is a
backward people," Yaakov said.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, as if on cue, two tanks and an armored personnel
carrier roared by. Because the community sits on a hill, with deep
valleys on either side, the roar echoes and is amplified, giving
residents a kind of stereophonic tank crescendo.</TE>
<TE>   In what for the Samaritans was an unprecedented display, residents
several weeks ago placed themselves in the road and blocked seven
Israeli tanks. Eventually, the army agreed to repair the roads.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a problem with the trucks and jeeps, but we simply
ask that they build a separate road for the tanks," Yaakov said.
"There is dust and dirt 2 meters deep."</TE>
<TE>   The tanks, of course, are on their way down the hill to Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Nablus, the Palestinians' largest West Bank city, in many ways
suffered more than any of its counterparts. The curfew has been in
place for months on end, longer than anywhere else. Destruction
during an Israeli offensive last spring was greatest in Nablus and
included ancient, irreplaceable cultural sites in its central casbah,
like a public bath and Byzantine church bombarded by Israeli tank
fire or rammed by Israeli bulldozers. And the death toll in Nablus
was higher during that offensive than in any other Palestinian city.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army regards Nablus as a hotbed for Palestinian
terrorism and points to numerous explosives labs and weapons caches,
some hidden in the casbah, as evidence. Many of the dead were killed,
and the destruction wrought, during pitched battles.</TE>
<TE>   Nablus claims a long tradition of resistance to authority. Founded
during the Roman Empire, it germinated uprisings throughout the
centuries and was the cradle of both recent Palestinian intifadas.
The 1987 revolt started here, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
militia that has wholly reshaped the current conflict, was born in
Nablus' Balata refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Fadi, blond with an impish grin, shuns armed activism and comes
from a prominent Nablus family. A cousin was one of the Arab world's
most famous poets.</TE>
<TE>   When he's not delivering or collecting mail, he is studying law at
Nablus' An Najah University. In recent months, however, classes have
been called off more often than not, and Fadi is attempting to finish
his studies through a correspondence course with a university in
Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   Fadi has worked for DHL for six years. Before the current
conflict, he frequented the main headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he
was on friendly terms with many of the Israeli employees.</TE>
<TE>   He says he misses the Israeli friends he had made .</TE>
<TE>   "They know I'm not a terrorist, and I know they're good people,"
he said. "We don't like to speak politics. If we talk politics, we
will disagree.... We were friends, not enemies. The intifada has
destroyed everything between us."</TE>
<TE>   Bothered that his old friends only called once to ask how he was
faring under Israeli military assault, Fadi nonetheless understands
the dynamics of two peoples who are each convinced that their own
suffering is unmatched.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we are in a very bad situation, and they feel they are in
a very bad situation," he said. "The Jews blame the Palestinians, the
Palestinians blame the Israeli people. I just hope they will finish
this war and then the relations will come back."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Fadi has had more than his share of close calls.
Once he was attempting to deliver mail in the nearby town of Tubas,
six miles from Nablus. With his delivery truck disabled in Jenin, he
went in a taxi and arrived without trouble. But on his way back, he
suddenly saw tanks closing in on the road, shooting as they advanced.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed to God," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The taxi driver was a bit more practical, and hid in an alleyway.
The tanks passed, in hot pursuit of other Palestinians. Fadi escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership between Fadi and Yaakov worked, off and on, for
most of the last year. Even though the Israeli military siege
tightened and civilians were frequently shot for violating curfew,
Fadi attempted to do business. For him, like for most Palestinians,
everything is tentative -- whether he can finish a delivery, whether
he'll get shot on the road, even where he can live and make a living.</TE>
<TE>   On a warm sunny day this autumn, hours after Israeli tanks rumbled
through the city once again, Fadi opened two of the four metal panels
from his office's front gate and waited for customers. Eventually,
20-year-old Mohammed Turaby ventured in, clutching the papers he
needed to send to Kansas to be able to attend university there next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "When will it go out?" Mohammed asked Fadi after paying the
equivalent of about $30.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow, maybe tomorrow," Fadi said. "Inshallah [God willing]."</TE>
<TE>   Fadi laughed at himself, then pointed to another DHL motto: "We
keep your promises."</TE>
<TE>   "Now there are no promises," Fadi said. "Only inshallahs."</TE>

<HD>'Refusenik' Reservists in Israel Make Their Case</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court hears arguments over whether individual
soldiers may follow conscience and spurn duty in the Palestinian
territories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Israeli military reservists who say conscience will not
permit them to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip took their fight
Wednesday to Israel's Supreme Court, where arguments by both sides
raised painful questions about duty, patriotism and what constitutes
moral warfare.</LD>
<LD>   The case marks the first time the high court has agreed to weigh
whether individual reservists have a right to mount a moral challenge
to a broad range of Israeli army practices in the Palestinian
territories through "selective refusal" -- that is, agreeing to
perform their mandatory annual military service, but not inside the
West Bank and Gaza.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, lawyers for the reservists, who call themselves
refuseniks, had intended to use the case as a vehicle to challenge
the overall legality of Israel's military occupation of Palestinian
areas. But they softened that position, believing that they had
virtually no chance of persuading the justices to agree to what would
amount to a sweeping condemnation of Israeli policy.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the refusenik camp hoped to set a more limited precedent,
under which the army might be instructed to consider cases of
conscience on an individual basis, much as it now rules on requests
for deferral of military service, which are most often granted on
religious grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The army declined direct comment on the Supreme Court proceedings
but has always maintained that allowing soldiers to opt out of duty
they find distasteful would make it impossible for the military to
function effectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't choose our missions," said army spokesman Lt. Col.
Olivier Rafowicz. "Our missions are decided by the government of
Israel, and like in any democracy, the army is there to fulfill what
the elected government has instructed it to do."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of this case is sensitive, coming as the defense
minister is locked in a confrontation with Jewish settler rabbis who
have been urging soldiers to disobey orders to dismantle illegal
settlement outposts.</TE>
<TE>   The refuseniks -- some of whom are highly decorated officers with
distinguished combat records -- say their case is fundamentally
different, focusing as it does on whether soldiers should be called
upon to perform actions that they believe violate the human rights of
Palestinians, such as demolishing homes, uprooting orchards or
endangering civilians by use of heavy weapons in densely populated
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people for whom conscientious objection is not easy.
These are not people who evade service," their attorney, Avigdor
Feldman, told the justices in a lengthy and impassioned statement.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not political people -- each of them stands on his own,
saying, 'I experienced terrible things. I witnessed things that
shocked me.' ... They saw soldiers firing into a Palestinian house,
not knowing who was inside. They saw tanks shelling houses, not
knowing who was inside. They are saying, 'I'm shocked, I cannot be a
part of this. I'm a man whose conscience is speaking.' "</TE>
<TE>   Arguing for the state, Aner Hellman said that the army
investigates any alleged wrongdoing in the field and that individual
soldiers could not take it upon themselves to judge whether
established army policy was right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about a new kind of war here, a war against
terrorism," he said. "Selective refusal is illegal. There's no
Western democracy which recognizes it. Everyone knows how dangerous
it can be, and Israel certainly isn't the place to experiment in
trying it."</TE>
<TE>   The justices listened attentively, interposing occasional short,
sharp questions. As is normal practice in cases argued before the
high court, attorneys wore long black robes like those of the judges,
lending the occasion an air of formality.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery was packed with spectators, many of them reservists or
their families and friends. Eight reservists are represented in the
case, but the refusenik movement has been gathering steam in recent
months, and hundreds of others are in similar circumstances, closely
watching the outcome of this case.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 500 reservists have signed a letter this year explaining
why they will not serve in the West Bank and Gaza. Many of them have
been removed from their units, and some have already served time in
jail.</TE>
<TE>   Amit Mashiah, 30, a staff sergeant and former commander in an
elite combat unit, said the army assigned him to fence-painting duty
at a dusty base near the Jordanian border after he signed the letter.
He may eventually face prison.</TE>
<TE>   He said he considers himself and other refuseniks to be patriots
and believes Palestinian suffering can only backfire on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is that tactically, refusing to serve there is exactly
the right thing to do in order to protect the citizens of Israel," he
said. "You're standing in a roadblock, seeing Palestinians who are
sometimes quite old waiting for hours under the sun. You get your
orders and you have to shut the roadblock, without knowing why. You
have to look at these people's faces. They're not angry, even, just
tired. How can this all end?"</TE>
<TE>   Military service, universal in this country, is a crucial element
in Israel's national ethic, and the reservists said it was difficult
for outsiders to understand how excruciating a step it was to bring
the case.</TE>
<TE>   The justices recessed after hearing daylong arguments. The court
could call the parties back to address particular points, or hand
down a ruling in several weeks, attorneys said.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Israeli Army Spy for Hezbollah Is Detained</HD>
<DH>Authorities accuse officer of providing data in return for
money and drugs, his lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- A high-ranking Israeli army officer has been arrested
and accused of spying for Hezbollah, a radical Muslim group that is
considered one of Israel's most implacable enemies.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the unidentified lieutenant colonel's arrest, and that of
at least nine other people, came from his lawyer, Amnon Zichroni, who
told Israeli media Wednesday that the officer was taken into custody
six weeks ago on suspicion of providing information on troop
deployments and other sensitive military matters in exchange for
drugs and money.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials were tight-lipped about the allegations. Neither
the army nor the prime minister's office had any immediate public
response.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli television reported that the detained officer had been
friendly with a number of senior Israeli military and political
officials, including former President Ezer Weizman. If the reports
are true, the officer would be the highest-ranking agent recruited by
Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Israeli official characterized the case as disturbing
mainly for its circumstances rather than for the quality of
intelligence allegedly handed over to Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   "These were operational details, not a question of larger
strategic secrets or some such," the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Zichroni said an indictment would be filed in a military court in
coming days, accusing his client of espionage and drug dealing. The
attorney said the officer, who denied all charges against him, had
been refused access to an attorney during the first 20 days he was
held.</TE>
<TE>   The reports described the officer and the others arrested as
Israeli Arabs from the Galilee, a region in Israel's north that is
home to many Druze and Bedouin. Israeli radio and television said
those arrested included others who had served or were serving in the
Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah, whose patrons are Iran and Syria, waged a nearly
2-decade-long guerrilla war to dislodge Israeli troops from the south
of Lebanon. Israel did withdraw from the self-declared buffer zone in
southern Lebanon in May 2000, but the frontier remains volatile, with
occasional shelling and cross-border clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah does not accept the United Nations-drawn border and lays
claim in Lebanon's behalf to a disputed area called Shabaa Farms.</TE>
<TE>   The espionage revelations are reminiscent of the arrest, in June,
of an Israeli of Lebanese descent on suspicion of spying for
Hezbollah. The case also comes at a time when tensions between Israel
and its northern neighbor are running high over a Lebanese water
project that Israel says illegally diverts water to which it is
entitled.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli radio reported that those in the alleged spying ring were
asked to provide information on the army's operations in the border
region, including details about bases, maps and deployment, in
exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of drugs.
Hezbollah's traditional base of operations has been Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley, a major drug-producing area.</TE>
<TE>   The officer's hometown was not disclosed by his lawyer, but
Israeli media reports said the man's family denied any involvement by
him in either drug-running or spying. Authorities were also said to
be investigating a possible link between the espionage ring and a
suspected cross-border infiltration in March that left six Israelis
dead.</TE>
<TE>   The burgeoning scandal threatened to overshadow the visit of U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State William Burns. The envoy was reported to
be carrying a plan setting out steps meant to lead to the
establishment of an interim Palestinian state as early as next year,
with full-fledged statehood by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Burns met Wednesday evening with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
was to see Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today. He was also to meet
with Palestinian officials today but not Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Introduces Iraq Resolution</HD>
<DH>Tough measure to force disarmament goes to Security Council
after weeks of negotiation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- The United States formally introduced a tough
resolution on Iraqi disarmament to the 15-member Security Council on
Wednesday, though the measure still faces strong opposition from
veto-holding Russia, France and China.</LD>
<LD>   Losing patience after six weeks of negotiation among the five
permanent council members, Washington decided to seek the support of
the rest of the body and push toward a vote on the measure next week.</LD>
<LD>   The move ratchets up the pressure on council members who, for
their own reasons, want to keep the United States engaged at the
world organization without letting Washington run the show. But it
also entails some risk for the Bush administration: Officials concede
that a vote could go either way.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. says it has legal justification for attacking Iraq alone,
but Washington would lose valuable international political support if
it did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all feel that the moment has come to give an added
sense of urgency to this question," said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
John D. Negroponte after introducing the text of the resolution.
"We've said from the beginning, from the time of [President Bush's]
speech to the General Assembly in September ... that we think we need
a strong resolution, we need credible inspections, and it's got to be
clear that there will be consequences for Iraq if it does not comply
with the resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. resolution seeks to force Iraq to allow in weapons
inspectors and give up any biological, chemical or nuclear arms and
the missiles that could be used to deliver them, as the regime of
President Saddam Hussein agreed to do after the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Security Council's ambassadors agree that Iraq should
face serious consequences -- even military action -- if it fails to
do so. But they want clear U.N. backing for any move against
Hussein's regime and fear that the U.S. will take a resolution as a
green light to use military force at the slightest provocation.</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, Iraqi Culture Minister Hamed Yousef Hamadi on
Wednesday called the U.S. draft a "declaration of war," Associated
Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the diplomatic struggle to come, Russian Ambassador
to the U.N. Sergei V. Lavrov quickly rejected the U.S. draft
Wednesday. His objections centered on language that warns Iraq it is
in "material breach" of past U.N. resolutions and will face "serious
consequences" if it fails to cooperate with a new weapons-inspection
process.</TE>
<TE>   Russia and France, backed by China, argue that those terms are
hidden triggers for automatic military action by the U.S. and Britain
and say that the new text gives inspectors "impossible" requirements
to fulfill.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot agree to unimplementable, unrealistic demands to be put
in this resolution," Lavrov said, adding that recent changes to the
text after three days of intense negotiations still failed to satisfy
their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, arriving in Los Cabos,
Mexico, for a meeting of Asian-Pacific foreign ministers, said, "We
have listened carefully to our friends. And we have tried to be
accommodating where it's appropriate, but we are not going to move
off basic principles." But he also said, "It is not a fiat that we
have put down, it's a circulating draft."</TE>
<TE>   To pass, the resolution needs nine votes in the 15-member Security
Council, and no veto by a permanent member -- the U.S., Britain,
China, France and Russia. Lavrov said his nation has not ruled out
using its veto.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 elected council members got their first official look at
the U.S. resolution Wednesday after complaining that they were being
kept out of the loop and had to find the content of the text in
newspaper articles.</TE>
<TE>   The entire council will meet again Friday to give the 10 elected
members a chance to digest the intricate language and get feedback
from their governments. On Friday, the debate will go "all day, or as
long as it takes," said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will have opportunities to persuade key leaders in the next
few days. Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Bush's ranch near
Crawford, Texas, on Friday. Bush also will meet with leaders of
Russia and other Pacific Rim nations at the economic summit in Mexico
this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Security Council will hear from the U.N.'s chief
weapons inspector, Hans Blix, to make sure its recommendations for
inspections are workable. U.S. officials hope members will be ready
for a vote soon after.</TE>
<TE>   If the debate follows the pattern set during discussions among the
five permanent members, it will be long and painstaking. Meeting at
different missions Tuesday and Wednesday, the ambassadors went
through the text line by line, with Lavrov voicing Russia's
objections to nearly every paragraph.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's vocal resistance has come as a surprise to the U.S. and
Britain, which are co-sponsoring the resolution. Until Monday, the
strongest opposition had been from France, which had proposed a
two-stage approach, giving Iraq another chance to disarm and
authorizing force only in a second resolution if Baghdad obstructed
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Intense talks with Paris produced a compromise: The U.S. would
consult the council if inspectors reported Iraq had failed to
cooperate to discuss what sort of consequences Baghdad should face.
But the U.S. emphasized it would not have to wait for U.N. approval
before taking military action.</TE>
<TE>   To other council members, that is not good enough. Syria, which
holds one of the elected seats, prefers that the U.S. withdraw the
resolution, Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe said Wednesday evening. "It has
too many triggers for using military force against Iraq, which is not
acceptable for the Arab world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Syria, the lone Arab voice on the council, is sure to vote
against the resolution or at least abstain, other diplomats have
similar concerns about the number of "triggers."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution calls for Iraq to accept its terms within seven
days, and to declare its programs to develop weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles within 30 days -- though "false
statements or omissions" from the list would not by themselves
automatically constitute a breach, as in earlier U.S. drafts.
Inspectors would have 45 days from the adoption of the measure to
resume work and would report back to the council 60 days after the
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   The draft demands that U.N. inspectors be allowed to search in
Iraq for weapons anywhere and at any time they choose -- including
"immediate, unimpeded, unconditional and unrestricted access to
presidential sites," vast compounds that the U.S. fears could be used
to hide weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution retains a clause allowing Iraqi scientists and
family members to be taken out of their homeland for interviews. The
move is seen as reducing possible intimidation by the Iraqi
government, but Hussein's regime regards it as a violation of
citizens' rights and an enticement to defect.</TE>
<TE>   The draft would also give inspectors the right to freeze Iraqi
movement in "no-drive and no-fly zones" around inspection sites to
ensure that material isn't spirited away as inspectors arrive. Iraq
views that measure as an insult to its territorial integrity. But the
new text dropped a controversial demand that armed guards accompany
inspectors and enforce the zones.</TE>
<TE>   The new draft also drops a proposal that representatives of the
five permanent members of the Security Council be allowed to join
inspection teams to guide them to suspect sites and receive
information gleaned from inspections -- a provision that seemed to
some a setup for espionage. The text does allow the chief weapons
inspectors to determine their own teams, which would not preclude
them from selecting experts armed with intelligence from their
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain hope to win agreement that an eventual
resolution must be much clearer and firmer than previous resolutions
that Iraq flouted.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstock, the British ambassador, said, "It's going to be a
tough one, but it's going to be a fair one under U.N. rules, and if
you get it wrong, then that's a disaster for you."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Pursues Microsoft Allegations</HD>
<DH>Justice Dept. looks into claims that the software giant is
hiding Windows details from rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is investigating allegations
that Microsoft Corp. continues to hide details about its flagship
Windows operating system from competitors, a tactic that could
unravel a proposed settlement to the 4-year-old antitrust case
against the software giant.</LD>
<LD>   The probe focuses on whether Microsoft is refusing to share
technical information that would allow rivals to write programs that
work as well with Windows as Microsoft's own software does, according
to executives whose companies have been in contact with
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Such behavior would violate key provisions of the accord that the
company reached with federal antitrust enforcers in November to bring
the landmark case to an end. U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly is expected to rule on the settlement any day -- and
legal scholars say she could well take Microsoft's current conduct
into account as she makes her decision.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said Wednesday that
the company's actions did not violate the proposed settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, California and eight of the states that sued Microsoft
in 1998 are trying to persuade the judge to reject the deal, which
they believe is too soft on the company. That Kollar-Kotelly has yet
to make a ruling four months after testimony was wrapped up in the
penalty phase of the long-running case makes them optimistic that she
is inclined to agree.</TE>
<TE>   After a 19-month trial, Microsoft was found guilty in June 2000 of
violating state and federal antitrust laws by using its monopoly
power in the crucial market for operating-system software to crush
rivals and extend its dominance to Web browsers, multimedia software
and other emerging technologies. Its Windows software runs on more
than 90% of all personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's alleged use of restrictive and discriminatory business
agreements was a key element in the dispute, which is widely
considered the most important business case since the breakup of
Standard Oil Co. nearly a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Appeals to higher courts failed to overturn the decision, but by
the time they were exhausted, George W. Bush had replaced Bill
Clinton in the White House. Under new management, the Justice
Department was more eager to bring the marathon case to a close.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement, reached in November, called for Microsoft to give
competitors access to so-called software communications protocols in
Windows so they could write programs that connect PCs to the Internet
and with one another, even if they run on disparate operating
systems. The company has been implementing changes in its business
conduct in advance of Kollar-Kotelly's ruling as a show of good
faith.</TE>
<TE>   But rivals including Sun Microsystems Inc. and Red Hat Inc. have
complained during the last two months that Microsoft has been less
than forthcoming. Justice Department officials began actively
pursuing the complaints in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Michael H. Morris, general counsel for Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Sun, said Justice Department investigators agreed to meet with him
next week to discuss the company's concern that Microsoft's
nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, are overly restrictive when it
comes to the communications protocols.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies also have been contacted, according to industry
sources.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 22 letter addressed to Justice Department antitrust
division head Charles A. James, a lobbyist for a group of Silicon
Valley firms opposing Microsoft complained that the software giant is
imposing onerous terms for the technical data it is willing to share
by requiring payment before companies can evaluate and test the
software code.</TE>
<TE>   "Surely prepayment for protocols not yet technically evaluated
cannot be reasonable," Mitchell S. Pettit, head of Project to Promote
Competition &amp; Innovation, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group
that opposes Microsoft, wrote in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Morris said that under the NDA, Sun cannot even detail its
grievances in public.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the terms of the NDA, I can't talk to you about the terms
of the NDA," he said. "It's quite bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft says its nondisclosure agreements and other conditions
it imposes on those who want access to its intellectual property are
widely used in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We agreed to license our intellectual property as part of the
settlement agreement with the Justice Department," said Microsoft
spokesman Jim Desler. "We set up a straightforward process, using
industry standards for people to do so. It's a confidential process."</TE>
<TE>   However, companies that sign NDAs are permitted to disclose any
problems to the Justice Department and the nine states that endorsed
the proposed settlement, Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo said he could not
comment on the matter because "all of this is pending before the
court."</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts say the Justice Department probe is unfolding
so late that it is unlikely to influence Kollar-Kotelly's ruling. The
59-year-old jurist has conducted a painstaking and methodical
examination of the Microsoft case during the last 12 months, going so
far as to carry case work home and phone lawyers at odd hours to ask
questions about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Justice Department inquiry has heartened officials from
the holdout states, who for months had complained that the federal
government was ignoring their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these same officials add that the longer Kollar- Kotelly
considers her ruling, the stronger the likelihood that she is
seriously considering the reservations that the holdout states have
long voiced about the proposed settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "If she wanted to rubber-stamp the consent decree, she would have
been done a long time ago," said one state lawyer, who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Tunney Act limits Kollar-Kotelly's freedom to impose
sweeping new sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said that in order for Microsoft to face harsher
punishment, Kollar- Kotelly would have to reject the settlement as
not being in the public interest -- something even state officials
believe she is unlikely to do.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say Kollar-Kotelly could use the new allegations
of Microsoft's unfair business conduct as leverage to encourage
Microsoft and the Justice Department to modify their proposed
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "She might call the parties in and say, 'I would approve the
settlement if you agree with the following changes,' " said Andrew
Gavil, an antitrust expert and law professor at Howard University.</TE>

<HD>4 U.S. Bishops Named to Sexual Abuse Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four American bishops were appointed Wednesday to a joint
Vatican-U.S. Catholic church commission that is supposed to revise
the American "zero-tolerance" policy on sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Vatican officials proposed the commission last week as a way of
resolving their objections to parts of the policy that U.S. bishops
adopted in June at the height of the sexual abuse scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The four U.S. members of the commission are Cardinal Francis
George of Chicago; Archbishop William Levada of San Francisco; Bishop
Thomas Doran of Rockford, Ill.; and Bishop William Lori of
Bridgeport, Conn.</LD>
<TE>   The four members from the Vatican are Cardinal Dario Castrillon
Hoyos, prefect of the Congregation for Clergy; Archbishop Julian
Herranz, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts;
Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, secretary of the Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith; and Archbishop Francesco Monterisi, secretary for
the Congregation for Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Friday, the Vatican said the American
policy, known as the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young
People, infringed on the due-process rights of accused priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican also questioned the charter's broad definition of what
constitutes sexual abuse and the role of boards composed of lay
Catholics that were given the role of reviewing how bishops handle
sex abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican decision met with anger and skepticism from support
groups for victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday a spokesman for one group said he was not reassured
by the membership of the new commission.</TE>
<TE>   None of the U.S. bishops appointed to the joint commission is "a
particularly strong advocate for victims," said Mark Serrano, a
member of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to remain hopeful for the safety of children or the
healing of our church while the Dallas charter is being eviscerated,"
Serrano said. He added that representatives of victims will be able
to speak with the bishops before they leave for Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the commission has no layperson or [sexual abuse]
survivor, it is imperative that they hear directly from victims and
laypeople before deciding to gut the Dallas charter," Serrano said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the church hierarchy, the head of the U.S. bishops
conference repeated assurances he made last week that the Vatican is
committed to protecting young people from sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials "have shown great pastoral care in their
sensitivity to the pain caused to victims, their commitment to the
need to protect society from perpetrators of abuse, their regard for
the respect that needs to be shown for the rights of the accused, and
their pain at the anguish caused to faithful Catholics by this sinful
and criminal conduct," Bishop Wilton T. Gregory of the Belleville,
Ill., Diocese said in his statement.</TE>

<HD>Fishing Permanently Banned Around the Channel Islands</HD>
<DH>A reserve, encompassing 175 square miles, takes effect Jan.
1 and is one of the largest in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SANTA BARBARA -- The California Fish and Game Commission on Wednesday
permanently banned fishing from 175 square miles of ocean around the
Channel Islands, approving one of the largest marine reserves in U.S.
waters.</LD>
<LD>   The decision culminated four years of scientific and public study
and debate over the wisdom of substituting traditional fishing
restrictions, such as size and catch limits on selected fish, with a
reserve system that protects all forms of marine life.</LD>
<LD>   "California once again is in the vanguard of environmental
protection," said Fish and Game Commissioner Bob Hattoy. "This is
good for the fish, good for the fishermen and good for future
generations."</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of angry, placard-carrying fishermen said the decision
would cut into their livelihoods as well as put some of their
favorite fishing grounds off limits.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay a lot of dollars [in fishing license fees] to the
Department of Fish and Game for the management of fisheries," said
Tom Raftican, president of United Anglers of Southern California. "I
have a very difficult time paying for an area I cannot fish."</TE>
<TE>   The commission's 2-1 vote establishes a network of 13 marine
reserves and conservation areas in state waters strategically placed
around the five islands to give a wide array of fish and shellfish a
chance to recover from decades of excessive fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement of the marine reserves will begin Jan. 1. The size of
the areas set aside could grow depending on action by the federal
government. Over the next year or two, federal officials will decide
whether to expand the cluster of reserves into federal waters, which
begin three miles from shore.</TE>
<TE>   A combined state and federal reserve system could ultimately
encompass 426 square miles, making it the largest complex of marine
reserves in the continental United States. The nation's largest
surrounds the northwest Hawaiian Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The reserves established Wednesday are considerably different from
the federal actions taken over the summer to ban bottom fishing for
rockfish across much of the continental shelf off California.</TE>
<TE>   Under those rules, fishermen may continue catching tuna, barracuda
or squid near the surface. They also can fish for halibut, which
generally live on sandy bottoms, away from the rocky reefs that are
home to rockfish.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the new Channel Islands marine reserves are permanent
and protect all sea life, from the biggest bass to the tiniest snail.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven of the 13 areas are no-take reserves, which means
no fishing of any kind, no diving for lobster or urchins and no
harvesting of kelp.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 13 areas are designated as "conservation areas" and
allow for limited recreational fishing and commercial lobster
trapping.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said he was "delighted" by the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Approving the Channel Islands reserves was a test case for state
Fish and Game officials, who next year will consider imposing
no-fishing zones and conservation areas along the state's 1,150-mile
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Although the concept of reserves is not new, existing reserves are
tiny. Around the Channel Islands, for instance, the only reserve is a
37-acre area off Anacapa Island.</TE>
<TE>   Still, scientists say the sea life inside the reserve
boundaries is remarkably abundant compared to surrounding waters that
are open to fishing.</TE>
<TE>   According to Mark Hixon, a marine scientist at Oregon State
University, the larger the reserves, the larger the potential
benefits, including the size of the resident fish. The larger the
fish, the more eggs it tends to produce, Hixon told the
commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have big, fat females in the system, because they
produce an enormous amount of eggs," he said. The problem, he said,
is that with intensive fishing, most fish never get a chance to reach
that size.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 1% of the world's oceans are now closed to fishing. In
California waters, less than .02% is inside no-take reserves.</TE>
<TE>   But reserves have begun to appear all over the globe, as
the world's leading marine scientists have called for 20% of the
oceans to be set off-limits to keep many types of fish from becoming
extinct.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Fletcher, a lobbyist for charter boat operators, insisted that
the commissioners were being misled by "theoretical science" about
the benefits to sea life while failing to consider the very real
economic loss to fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Recreational fishermen argued passionately that they were not
responsible for the decline of fisheries. Instead, they pointed to
commercial fishermen who sweep through with massive nets that kill
tons of fish.</TE>
<TE>   But government scientists say that's not entirely true around the
Channel Islands and elsewhere in Southern California. Fish have
declined to such an extent that many of the commercial fishermen have
moved on or gone out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Recreational anglers caught 150 tons of bocaccio from 1998 through
2000, while commercial fishermen caught 23 tons during those same
years, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   Bocaccio, a popular red-colored fish commonly sold as "rock cod,"
is so depleted it is being considered for listing as an endangered
species.</TE>
<TE>   A number of fishermen directed their wrath at commissioner Hattoy,
a former Sierra Club regional director and Clinton administration
official who was recently appointed by Davis to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you will call me wrong," Hattoy told several fishermen
who heckled him. "But your grandchildren will call me right."</TE>
<TE>   In voting for the reserves, Hattoy was joined by fellow Davis
appointee Sam Schuchat. Commissioner Mike Chrisman, who was appointed
by former Gov. Pete Wilson, voted no. Two other commissioners were
absent.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the staff of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary
and National Marine Fisheries Service will begin a lengthy process of
federal rule-making that will help determine the ultimate size of the
reserve system.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which sets federal fishing
rules, will also take up the matter. Executive Director Donald
McIsaac said that while the council generally supports marine
reserves, it had not come to a decision about the Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of scientists had recommended that 30% to 50% of the
waters around the Channel Islands be protected to allow depleted
species to recover and begin "seeding" surrounding areas with larvae
and spillover fish.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen wanted 13% or less placed off limits.</TE>
<TE>   When a two-year effort to reach consensus failed, the state
Department of Fish and Game and the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary
came up with a compromise plan. The first phase was approved
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If the federal officials follow suit, the combined reserve system
would protect about 25% of the waters immediately surrounding the
islands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good first step," said Linda Krop, chief counsel of
Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara. "Hopefully, this will
be seen as a model for additional reserves along the West Coast."</TE>

<HD>Aspirin Aids Heart Patients, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Taken within two days of bypass surgery, it could save
25,000 lives a year, researcher suggests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Patients who take aspirin within two days of heart bypass surgery
dramatically reduce their health risks, researchers said Wednesday,
in a finding they say could save 25,000 lives worldwide every year.</LD>
<LD>   The conclusion challenges conventional wisdom that has kept bypass
surgery patients off the less expensive, generic painkiller amid
fears it could lead to dangerous bleeding.</LD>
<LD>   Such thinking is not only wrong but also probably contributes to
about 9,000 deaths each year in the United States alone, according to
a $35-million study published in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   The study's authors found that giving heart bypass patients
aspirin within 48 hours of surgery cut the death rate by 68% during
the study period.</TE>
<TE>   The chances of stroke decreased by 62%, the likelihood of kidney
problems fell by 60%, and the risk of developing a heart attack was
nearly cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   Aspirin substantially mitigates fatal and nonfatal damage to the
heart, brain, kidneys and intestines, said the team of researchers,
led by Dennis Mangano of the San Francisco-based Ischemia Research
and Education Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to current belief, aspirin therapy was safe and was not
associated with an increased risk of bleeding, gastritis, infection,
or impaired wound healing," the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Editors of the Journal said a formal clinical trial is needed
before aspirin therapy becomes routine, and Robert Bonow, president
of the American Heart Assn., said there was still reason for caution.</TE>
<TE>   But Mangano said that, instead of waiting five years for a
clinical trial to be done, doctors should apply his team's findings
immediately -- a move he said would save 25,000 lives a year
worldwide and prevent 50,000 complications at very little cost.</TE>
<TE>   Mangano's foundation is an independent, nonprofit organization
that does clinical trials for the government and pharmaceutical
companies. It used income from those trials to fund the aspirin
study, Mangano said, because no drug company is going to pay for a
study of an inexpensive generic drug like aspirin.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation called the findings
"quite striking" and said that, until it is shown to be hazardous,
early aspirin use after bypass surgery should become standard
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The benefits appear to be important and overriding," Topol wrote
in a Journal editorial.</TE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The detained co-founder of an Islamic charity pleaded for political
asylum Wednesday, saying he would be a target of both sides in the
war on terrorism if he were deported to Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Rabih Haddad testified that Al Qaeda supporters could persecute
him for his vocal opposition to the terrorist group and last year's
terrorist attacks. He said he also feared action by the Lebanese
government because of U.S. allegations linking him with terrorist
activities.</LD>
<LD>   Lebanon is "very eager to show the U.S. that they are one in the
war against terrorism," Haddad said at an asylum hearing before
Immigration Judge Robert Newberry. "There's no telling what they
could do."</LD>
<TE>   Haddad, who has been jailed since Dec. 14 on a visa violation,
denies that he or his organization, Global Relief Foundation, have
links to terrorism. The Bush administration has said it suspects
Global Relief of having such ties, but no criminal charges have been
filed against Haddad or the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Ann Arbor, Mich., Haddad, 41, is seeking asylum for
himself and his family. The government also is trying to deport his
wife, Salma Rushaid, and three of their four children. Arguing
against asylum, Immigration and Naturalization Service attorney
Marsha Nettles said the court heard no evidence to prove that anyone
in Lebanon would attempt to harm Haddad if he were deported. Nettles
said Haddad has traveled to Lebanon and has lived there for extended
periods since the mid-1980s. She said he never was persecuted for his
views.</TE>

<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law said he had considered resigning over the Roman
Catholic church's sexual abuse scandal, but felt it was his duty to
stay on and help fix the damage.</LD>
<LD>   Law, who came under intense criticism since the scandal erupted in
Boston in January for allegedly failing to remove sexually abusive
priests, addressed hundreds of Boston Archdiocese priests for the
second day.</LD>
<LD>   Law said that, after a meeting in April with Pope John Paul II, he
raised the possibility of resigning but came away determined to stay
on and repair the damage to the archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   Law met with about 400 priests at St. Camillus in Arlington. He
met with about 300 priests in Medway on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Some Democrats Also Try to Ride Bush's Coattails</HD>
<DH>Recognizing his popularity, campaigns are using the
president's image and words.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Although he's not on the Nov. 5 ballot, President Bush
is popping up in campaigns all over the country -- in person, in
pictures and in printed words. And not just on behalf of Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   In a testament to Bush's popularity in the polls, Democrats from
the West to the Farm Belt to the Deep South also are associating
themselves with him on a variety of domestic and international
issues, using his images and utterances in their own campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   These Democrats include Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Tom
Harkin of Iowa. The two prairie populists strongly disagree with the
president on most issues, but have highlighted Bush's praise for
their work in this year's passage of a farm bill that significantly
increased federal aid to agriculture.</LD>
<TE>   Like Democrats across the country, Wellstone and Harkin
ferociously oppose much of Bush's agenda, especially his economic
priorities. But they and other Democrats are trying to benefit from
Bush's high poll ratings -- fueled by his role as commander in chief
in the war on terrorism -- for a simple reason: Almost without
exception, they represent a district or state that Bush won or
narrowly lost in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes perfect political sense. Democrats in these states need
to make voters believe that it is not necessary to vote Republican to
back Bush," said Larry J. Sabato, a political analyst at the
University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, of course, hopes that voters think otherwise. To that end,
he has devoted much of his time to traveling the country on behalf of
GOP candidates -- an effort that will accelerate in the next two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's prominent role in the midterm elections, including his
prodigious fund-raising, bears implications for his expected
reelection bid. A big day for Republicans on Nov. 5 would lend him
the aura of a popular leader with impressive coattails and help him
build momentum toward 2004. A GOP-controlled Congress also would
revive key parts of his agenda -- such as further tax cuts -- that
are stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's political strategists already are laying the
groundwork for Bush to assert a modicum of victory -- for himself and
the party -- even if the GOP were to lose control of the House and
fail to recapture the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In most midterm elections in a president's first term, his party
loses an average of 30 House seats; no analyst expects that to happen
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a position, we think, to potentially defy history --
and thereby make history," said Ken Mehlman, the White House
political director. "Historically, the president's party takes a
drubbing in off-year elections. So if we don't take a drubbing, that
will be a positive statement."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers would seem to back up Mehlman. In the latest Gallup
Poll, which is consistent with many others, Bush enjoyed a 62%
approval rating and a 28% disapproval rating. At the same point in
their presidencies, Ronald Reagan's approval-disapproval numbers were
42% and 48%; Bill Clinton's 40% and 51%. The last president to enjoy
a popularity rating above 60% at about the same point was John F.
Kennedy, and that was after a peaceful resolution of the Cuban
missile crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982 and 1994, respectively, Reagan and Clinton were roundly
attacked during the midterm election campaigns. Reagan called on the
electorate to "stay the course." Many Democrats ran against Reagan by
calling for change. The Democrats gained 26 House seats, though they
lost one Senate seat.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Republicans all over the country used "morph" ads, with
depictions of Clinton that faded into the likeness of the local
Democratic candidates. The GOP gained 52 House seats and eight in the
Senate, sweeping to control of both chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Seen in that light, the current embrace of Bush by some Democrats
running for reelection is remarkable. "There is no other recent
comparable midterm election," Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, which Bush won by 25 percentage points in 2000,
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus in one ad focused on his defense record
and his efforts in helping "pass the president's defense budget." In
Louisiana, which Bush won by 8 percentage points, a Democratic ad
boasted that Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu voted with the president
74% of the time -- including for his 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, which Bush won by 12 percentage points, Democratic
Sen. Max Cleland took out an ad highlighting his support of Bush's
efforts to make air travel more secure after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking reelection as Georgia's governor, Democrat Roy Barnes has
used photos of himself with Bush and claimed that he patterned his
own education reform bill after the plan Bush pushed through in
Texas. In a House race in Utah, which Bush won by a whopping 41
percentage points, Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson has campaigned as an
"independent voice" and emphasized his support for Bush's tax cut and
the president's education reforms.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, which Bush carried by 22 percentage points,
Democrat Sen. Tim Johnson -- who faces a Republican personally
recruited by the White House -- has touted his vote for an array of
administration priorities, above all the tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, which Democrat Al Gore won by 2 percentage points in
2000, Wellstone's campaign displayed on its Web page a photo of the
senator with Bush at the May 13 signing of the farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   But a campaign spokesman added, almost apologetically, "we're
certainly not running on his friendship with Bush."</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa, which Gore won by a single percentage point, Harkin's
campaign also has used a photograph featuring Bush from the signing
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they do this is that swing voters love to see
themselves as voting for the person, not the party. And some take it
as a point of pride that they do not vote party lines," said
Washington-based independent political analyst Charles E. Cook Jr.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Big Boost in Defense Spending</HD>
<DH>The $355.5-billion bill is the largest increase since
Reagan era, amid threat of terrorism and war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed into law Wednesday the biggest military
spending increase since the Reagan administration -- a $355.5-billion
package giving the wartime Pentagon "every resource, every weapon and
every tool they need."</LD>
<LD>   Overwhelmingly approved by Congress, the measure contains a 4.1%
salary increase for military personnel, $7.4 billion to keep
developing a ballistic missile defense system and $72 billion for new
weapons.</LD>
<LD>   With the president contemplating war against Iraq, and U.S. troops
involved in an anti-terrorism campaign across the globe, the law
increases Pentagon spending in almost every area for the budget year
that began Oct. 1 by a total of more than $34 billion, or 11%, over
the previous year. It was the biggest increase in 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, Americans have been reminded that the safety of
many depends on the courage and skill of a few," Bush told a Rose
Garden audience filled with uniformed military personnel and
lawmakers from both parties. "The bill today says America is
determined and resolute to not only defend our freedom but to defend
freedom around the world, that we're determined and resolute to
answer the call to history and that we will defeat terror."</TE>
<TE>   He also signed a $10.5-billion bill financing the building and
upgrading of military installations in fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   While Congress gave Bush most of what he requested, lawmakers
rejected his plea for a $10-billion fund he could tap without
congressional input for combating terrorists overseas.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement later in the day, Bush said he was disappointed by
that decision and another to approve $2.7 billion less than he wanted
for operations and maintenance programs. "Without these funds, we may
be forced to reduce other important programs to finance the war on
terrorism," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   There was a tinge of politics in the bill signing before elections
that will decide which party controls Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Bush took a veiled dig at the Democratic-controlled Senate for the
failure to approve his request for a Cabinet-level Homeland Security
Department. The president noted that all the armed forces were
collected under a single federal roof when President Truman began
revamping national security agencies after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "He reorganized our nation's defense structure to meet the
security threats of a new era," Bush said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Election regulators preparing to implement the nation's new campaign
finance law are stepping into one of its thorniest issues: to what
extent political parties, interest groups and candidates can legally
coordinate their spending.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the key players, including the Democratic and Republican
national committees, business lobbies and campaign watchdog groups,
are offering their views at a two-day Federal Election Commission
hearing that started Wednesday. The commissioners weighed in too.</LD>
<LD>   "Our responsibility is to try and make sense out of what the
Congress did. They rejected what we had done in this area and then
turned around and gave us no particular guidance, which was not very
helpful," Commissioner Danny McDonald said.</LD>
<TE>   "Our problem gets to be, I think from a very practical standpoint,
what do people know, and what is their relationship with others?"</TE>
<TE>   The new law, due to take effect Nov. 6, the day after the
elections, will bar the national party committees from raising
unlimited donations from businesses, unions and others.</TE>
<TE>   The parties can currently spend such contributions, known as soft
money, on general party activities such as get-out-the-vote drives
and ads on party issues.</TE>
<TE>   The law also directs the FEC to write new rules on the degree to
which interest groups, party committees and candidates can share
information and strategize with each other about election activities
without it counting against federal spending limits.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is the level at which interest groups and parties
may spend on behalf of presidential and congressional candidates.</TE>

<HD>Church Helps Out Family Tree Buffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mormon Church has put millions of 19th century ancestors on its
genealogy Web site, giving family tree buffs a more convenient -- and
free -- way to trace their heritage.</LD>
<LD>   The church said Wednesday it is offering free Internet access to
55 million names from the 1880 United States census and the 1881
Canadian census.</LD>
<LD>   Before, census records from those years were available on a
microfilm set spanning 56 compact discs -- a search process many
found cumbersome and time-consuming. People either had to buy the set
or visit a Mormon genealogy center.</LD>
<TE>   On the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Web site,
www.familysearch.org, the searchers are allowed to find ancestors not
only by name, but by race, birthplace, location or neighbor's name.</TE>
<TE>   "For some, this may be overkill, because they already know the
name they're looking for, but when you don't know very much, the
other ways can be helpful," said Todd Christofferson, executive
director of the church's family history department.</TE>
<TE>   Building the database took 17 years and 11 million work hours,
Christofferson said. Every name was viewed at least three times --
first by an extractor and then by at least two reviewers -- to ensure
accuracy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other genealogical data, such as records from Ellis Island, N.Y.,
are provided for free on the Internet by the church.</TE>
<TE>   The 1880 census is particularly crucial because records of the
1890 census were destroyed by fire, leaving a 20-year gap. Census
records from 1870 are incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   The census information was gathered by thousands of census takers
who traveled American cities, towns, backwoods and frontier
settlements on foot or horseback after the Civil War. They recorded
each person's name, age, gender, race, marital status, occupation,
relationship to head of household, birthplace and, for the first
time, the birthplace of the individual's parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that by searching for ancestors, we may understand who we
are and what we may become," said church President Gordon B.
Hinckley.</TE>
<TE>   The church is a major producer of genealogical materials.</TE>

<HD>Immigrants Fearful to Come Forward, Latino Leaders Say</HD>

<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A police decision to hand over two undocumented
migrants to immigration authorities this week is silencing potential
witnesses in the serial sniper investigation, area Latino leaders
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a really bad message to send the Latino community and
immigrants in general," said Gustavo Torres, director of a suburban
Montgomery County social service agency, CASA of Maryland. "I am not
going to encourage my community to [report] those criminals, [if]
witnesses are going to be deported."</LD>
<LD>   The two men--a 24-year-old Mexican and a 35-year-old from
Guatemala--were picked up Monday in a case of mistaken identity by
police in Richmond, Va. They were in a white van and using a pay
phone that the sniper may have used to call police. They now face
deportation.</LD>
<TE>   In some California municipalities, law enforcement guidelines
would have called for setting the men free after questioning, if it
was determined that they were doing nothing wrong. CASA and nine
other organizations Wednesday issued a statement calling on police in
the Washington area to adopt similar policies.</TE>
<TE>   More than 430,000 Latinos live in the region. A recent study by
the Pew Hispanic Center found that close to 90% are residents of the
suburbs, the territory favored by the sniper. Many work in
construction and other trades that require an early start to the day,
a time period the sniper has sometimes used to stalk victims.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and local officials were scrambling to contain the
community relations fallout by reassuring immigrants with potentially
useful information that the police are not interested in their visa
status.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to personally urge the immigrant community to come forward
if they have information that will assist in this investigation,"
Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner James Ziglar said in a
statement issued Wednesday. "INS will not seek immigration status
information provided to local authorities in this effort."</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar held out the possibility that the INS would help
undocumented migrants who assist the police gain legal status, under
a federal law that makes special provisions for people who aid
crime-fighting efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But damage already appeared to have been done.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the police were blithely mentioning turning those
individuals over to INS has sent a chill through the Latino
community," said Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National
Council of La Raza and a Montgomery County resident. "Latinos are
living with the same fear as everybody else. They need to know that
if they see something suspicious, it's safe to call the police."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose said his department
is concerned that immigrants are not talking. "We strongly feel there
are witnesses that have not come forward," he said. "There may be
some people [with] some type of immigration status that may be
witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Doug Duncan pledged a "don't ask, don't tell"
policy. "The message is, you can talk to us, you can help us in the
investigation and we're not going to ask about your immigration
status."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Henrico County police in Virginia, where the
two Latinos were arrested, was not available for comment. The two men
have not been identified by authorities. Torres, the Maryland social
service executive, said the 24-year-old Mexican is a carpenter who
had lived in the area for some years.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, some police agencies are not obligated to hand over
law-abiding undocumented migrants to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, close to the Mexican border, Sgt. David Contreras
said his department has a policy that expressly protects immigrants
who are crime victims, witnesses or potential witnesses. San Diego
police also do not report people cited during routine traffic stops.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that they trust us and report crimes without
being afraid of the police," Contreras said. "It's one of the best
policies and procedures that we have."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the arrests Monday in Virginia, Contreras said his
department would have let the two men go. "They didn't commit any
crime," Contreras said, "so we would not have called the Border
Patrol."</TE>

<HD>Attacks in Governor's Race Getting Personal</HD>
<DH>Massachusetts contest is heated, nasty and too close to
call. The state also has a reputation as being a springboard for
presidential hopefuls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- From one perspective, it is a battle between an experienced
pro and a callow political neophyte. From another, it is a showdown
pitting a fresh-minded outsider against a tired Beacon Hill hack.</LD>
<LD>   Whichever, the Massachusetts governor's race between Democrat
Shannon O'Brien, the insider, and Republican Mitt Romney, the
outsider, is heated, nasty and too close to call. The spirited
election has drawn national attention because of Massachusetts'
reputation for spawning aspiring presidents.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the ways to get into the national game is to become either
governor or a U.S. senator from Massachusetts," said political
analyst Lou Di Natale of the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
"Just look over the last 40 years. We've had Jack Kennedy, Ted
Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Bill Weld, Paul Tsongas -- and now John
Kerry."</LD>
<TE>   Entering the final days of campaigning, Romney and O'Brien have
engaged in personal attacks after pledging to avoid them. Rather than
emphasize a host of substantive issues, both sides have focused on
competing portrayals of themselves. This venom could carry over into
a debate tonight between Romney, O'Brien and three minor-party
candidates -- all women.</TE>
<TE>   Romney -- former chief of Bain Capital and this year's Salt Lake
City Olympics -- spent much of this week attacking O'Brien's husband,
contending that lobbyist Robert Emmet Hayes collected hundreds of
thousands of dollars from projects overseen by O'Brien, the state
treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is absolutely clear that it is wrong for the treasurer
of the commonwealth to have her husband working as a lobbyist at the
same time," Romney said at one of dozens of appearances. "It may not
be illegal, but it is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien retaliated by calling her opponent "Tricky Mitt," a
nickname echoing the bad old days of fellow Republican Richard Nixon,
and by blasting a new series of television attack ads.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me be quite clear," she said. "We should not be bringing
spouses into this race.... We should be talking about which candidate
will do the most for working families."</TE>
<TE>   She also accused Romney of reaping profits from what she suggested
were dubious venture capital deals, calling on him to disclose more
about his finances.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of O'Brien, 43, say that even in grammar school it was
clear she would follow in the footsteps of four generations of
Democratic politicos. As the oldest of five children, she set her
sights on attending Yale well before her father's alma mater began
admitting women. She was 19 when her Yale roommates started asking
when she planned to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Boston University Law School in 1985, she
ran for state representative from western Massachusetts, squeaking
into office in 1986 over three more experienced candidates. She won
in part because she was a tireless campaigner, but also because so
many people in the area knew her from years of tagging along with her
father.</TE>
<TE>   The strong paternal influence gives O'Brien an ironic bond with
Romney, whose late father, George, was governor of Michigan and an
unsuccessful GOP candidate for president. Ed O'Brien, Shannon's
father, was elected in 1970 to the governor's council, a position
dating from Colonial times that involves approving gubernatorial
decisions. Besides time off for a failed run for Congress in 1976, he
has held the job ever since.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien lost one election: in 1994. It was her first bid for the
position she now holds. Running again four years later, she won.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates share ground here too. Romney, who settled outside
Boston when he attended Harvard Business School more than 30 years
ago, leaped into politics here in 1994 by challenging the Democratic
party's war horse, Edward M. Kennedy, for the U.S. Senate. Romney
lost, but the high-profile bid established him as an ambitious asset
to the state GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Romney returned from his triumphant role as head of the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and immediately cast his gaze
toward the governor's office, occupied the last 12 years by
Republicans. Party leaders told acting Gov. Jane Swift -- a
Republican who rose through state ranks -- that she would have to
make way.</TE>
<TE>   After braving a Democratic challenge to his residency based on
taxes filed for several years in Utah, Romney depicted O'Brien as an
insider beholden to a crumbling statehouse establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old venture capitalist also said repeatedly that
O'Brien lacked the kind of business experience needed to bolster the
state's sagging economy. "It is increasingly clear that this is a
campaign about who has the most experience in the private sector," he
said this week while touring a Cambridge high-tech company. "This is
about who can speak with enterprise around the state and around the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Romney, hammering O'Brien's lobbyist husband, vowed this week, if
elected, to immediately establish a policy barring the appointment of
Cabinet officers or senior staff members who have family members who
are lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Republican strategist Charlie Manning, a Romney
consultant, said the GOP candidate was merely responding to assaults
from O'Brien about his role in corporate transactions that earned him
millions.</TE>
<TE>   "When you run in Massachusetts, where only 13% of voters are
Republicans, it is always an uphill fight," Manning said. "When
you're fired on in Massachusetts, you have to fire back."</TE>
<TE>   Faulting "disgraceful and deceptive ads" that Romney has run
attacking her husband, O'Brien contended that she has tried valiantly
to keep the race centered on issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked hard to talk about schools, to talk about health
care, to talk about education," she said. Asked if her campaign had
any ads to respond to Romney's latest offensive, she responded with a
crisp, "No."</TE>
<TE>   How the electorate will process the rhetoric is unknown, said
University of Massachusetts communications professor Ralph Whitehead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm completely baffled," Whitehead said. "Certainly the
electorate is awash in concerns this year. Voters are worried about
the economy, about services provided by state government and so on.
But the respective campaigns have not focused on those issues."</TE>
<TE>   With "competing narratives" driving the campaign, "voters are
reluctant to commit fully to either of these two candidates,"
Whitehead said. With the election nearing, "there's still a segment
of the electorate that is extremely volatile. This campaign could
still go through several cycles of competition."</TE>

<HD>Media's Role in Drama Debated</HD>
<DH>Some fear that TV news outlets' intense coverage of the
shootings may be affecting the sniper's actions, 'egging him on' and
stoking public fear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The pattern is chilling, as if the sniper is watching
experts on television predict his next move -- and then acting on it.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Ressler, a former FBI profiler, suggests on CNN's "Larry
King Live" that the sniper might travel as far south as Richmond,
Va., perhaps "down to Ashland." The next day, a 37-year-old man is
shot in the stomach leaving the Ponderosa steakhouse in Ashland, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Gregg McCrary, a former FBI psychological profiler, tells CBS News
on a Friday that the sniper has "a God complex, killing these people
at random and from a long distance."</LD>
<TE>   The next Monday, a 13-year-old boy is shot after being dropped off
at school. The sniper reportedly leaves behind a tarot card, the
death card, inscribed with the message: "Dear Mr. Policeman, I am
God."</TE>
<TE>   And Bo Dietl, a former New York detective who served as the model
for the lead character in the film "One Tough Cop," tells CNN
audiences the sniper is "a coward." More shootings follow.</TE>
<TE>   "We're egging him on," said Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a clinical
professor at Yale University and author of "Guilty by Reason of
Insanity: A Psychiatrist Explores the Minds of Killers."</TE>
<TE>   Fuming at the guests who appeared before her Friday on Larry
King's show, she admonished them not to challenge the sniper. "You
don't challenge," she told the panelists. "You don't say, 'You're a
coward,' you don't say, 'You're not a good sniper,' because that's an
invitation to go out and prove that he's really the world's best
sniper."</TE>
<TE>   As the carnage has mounted, media coverage of the sniper attacks
that are terrorizing the Washington area has come under the usual
criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that the media are only fueling public fear. Others,
particularly in law enforcement, are furious at media disclosures of
information such as the location of roadblocks. There are even
complaints about the logos networks are using. CNN's "Sniper on the
Loose" is a frequently cited example.</TE>
<TE>   But what distinguishes the sniper case from earlier serial murders
where the killer appeared to be following coverage of his spree is
that the coverage is now continuous. With police reluctant to give
out too much information, producers are filling the airwaves with
chatter from a variety of talking heads.</TE>
<TE>   "It's agonizing," said Frank Sesno, CNN's former Washington bureau
chief and now a professor of public policy and communications at
George Mason University in Virginia. "Typically what serial killers
want is notoriety. This guy is getting it live."</TE>
<TE>   Media executives defend their choices, saying they are booking
respected experts who are qualified to analyze and assess each day's
events. "It's laying a bit too much on the media to say we're
provoking him," said Teya Ryan, executive vice president of CNN.
"We're doing our best to report the story honestly."</TE>
<TE>   Further, some defending the media note that so-called talking
heads are not the only ones talking. President Bush also called the
killer's actions cowardly, and his words were widely broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the world we live in now," Sesno said. "When you get into
live news, you're talking about the tyranny of the incremental
development. Wall-to-wall coverage can be riveting. It can also be
unfiltered news that takes you over a cliff."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Glassner, a USC sociologist, faults the media for hyping the
story. Author of "Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the
Wrong Things," Glassner says of cable news networks that "you can
count on them to over-report some dramatic, scary story pretty much
at all times. That's how they make their living. Before this it was
child kidnappings. Last year it was shark attacks."</TE>
<TE>   A risk analyst, Glassner calculates that pedestrians have a
greater possibility of being hit by a car than by a sniper. And yet
the randomness of the sniper's bullets, coupled with the saturation
media coverage, contributes to a heightened fear.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers are not immune from the criticism. The Washington Post
headlined a story about how the sniper had not shot anyone on a
weekend -- five days before he did.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the criticisms, the reign of terror is boosting ratings
for cable news networks. In fact, they are now at their highest
levels since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the end of
last week, Fox News Channel's average daily audience was up 27% from
a month before; CNN's was up 29%; MSNBC's, up 24%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Striking a respectful and even deferential tone,
Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose has had a lot
to say in recent days to the sniper terrorizing the Washington area.
"We do want to talk to you.... We remain open and ready to talk....
If you would feel more comfortable, a private P.O. box number or
another secure method can be provided."</LD>
<LD>   But while broadcasting carefully to an audience of one,
authorities have had little to say to millions of anxious residents
that might help them assist the police with tips, or even assess
their own level of risk in the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of information has drawn complaints that authorities are
withholding key facts from the public. But it stems from a careful
balancing act.</LD>
<TE>   "If Moose offends the shooter, then the shooter will go out and do
it again," said Eric Hickey, a professor of criminal psychology at
Cal State Fresno. At the same time, some information that may offend
the shooter could also help people identify the sniper or determine
how to conduct their lives while the shooter is still on the loose.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, debate centered on the decision by authorities to
withhold a written threat, apparently from the sniper, that said
children in the region were not safe "anywhere, at any time." The
threat was contained in a note found Saturday at the site of the
sniper's 12th shooting, in Virginia, but it was not confirmed until
Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons police withheld that detail were unclear. The sniper
may have demanded it, or authorities may have feared that releasing
it would have unduly panicked the public or revealed information best
left secret for investigative reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Still, their reticence had a cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Public confidence is tremendously important, and that was shaken
a little bit by law enforcement holding back the information about
the threat against children," said Clinton R. Van Zandt, formerly the
FBI's chief hostage negotiator. "Law enforcement can't work without
the support of the public. If that belief in law enforcement's
ability to solve the case and act in our best regard is eroded, that
contributes to anxiety, frustration and fear on the part of the
public."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, former investigators and criminal behavior experts have
asked why police have chosen not to reveal the full text of the
Saturday letter or of other written and telephone communications.</TE>
<TE>   "How did we get the Unabomber? By publishing his manifesto, and
then his brother called in and said he recognized the writing," said
Robert Fitzpatrick, a private investigator in Boston and former FBI
hostage negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   Also puzzling has been Moose's comment, made at least three times,
that the sniper is able to strike people of any race and gender over
a wide area, as if acknowledging the attacker's prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Some specialists saw the comments as a type of protection from
liability in case more people are shot, while others saw it as
another attempt to build a rapport with the shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night Moose again addressed the media as he announced
that a federal arrest warrant for a firearms violation had been
issued for a man he identified as John Allen Muhammad, who should be
considered "armed and dangerous." But Moose cautioned that the public
should not assume that the man was involved in the sniper case.</TE>
<TE>   The chief then issued another cryptic message to the sniper:</TE>
<TE>   "You asked us to say, quote, We have caught the sniper like a duck
in a noose, unquote. We understand that hearing us say that is
important to you. However, we want you to know how difficult it has
been to understand what you want because you have chosen to use only
notes, indirect messages and calls to other jurisdictions.... Let's
talk directly. We have an answer for you about your option. We are
waiting for you to contact us."</TE>
<TE>   In these public statements, several specialists said, Moose, the
leader of the multi-jurisdiction task force, is surely guided by the
FBI's criminal behavior experts, who try to calculate the effect that
each statement or action will have on the killer.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in his manner and tone, he is carefully coached," said Dr.
Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist at the New York University
School of Medicine. He said Moose was striving to appear "diplomatic"
and to build an emotional connection with the sniper.</TE>
<TE>   "When you deal with someone who has the capacity to be
destructive, and to do it impulsively, you try to keep him connected,
communicating, because it is his alienated quality that enables him
to kill," said Welner, who also leads a consultancy called the
Forensics Panel. "The more connected he is, the more difficult it is
for him to kill randomly.... What he's doing is to bridge that
gap.... "</TE>
<TE>   Moose's deferential tone has been so noteworthy that he was asked
about it at a news conference Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said only that "my parents prefer it if I'm a gentleman
at all times."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials used a news conference Wednesday to
defend their flow of information to the public. "There seem to be a
lot of questions about what we're releasing and when," acknowledged
Michael Bouchard of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms. But Welner said that to calm public anxiety, police should
put out more messages about what kind of person they're seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't need to give all the details of the profile, just, 'If
you know a person who is like XYZ or ABC, please tell us,' " he said.
"You might think that's unwise because it narrows the investigation,
but they've got so many clues and they need a narrowing mechanism,
and the public needs some guidance. Then the public knows what they
can do, and they start mobilizing."</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt said another piece in calibrating the public message
involved the "hit of emotional heroin" the killer likely receives
when his actions are publicized.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement is trying to walk a tightrope between giving the
public the information it needs to make its own decisions without
creating a public panic," he said, "and playing totally into the
hands of the shooter so that he's putting out manifestos two or three
times a day.... It's a horrible situation for law enforcement."</TE>

tomorrow.</LD>
<TE>   Immigration, both legal and not, has turned Denison -- population
7,300 -- into an unlikely boom town.</TE>
<TE>   And not only Denison. Across the Midwest, a dozen or so small
communities and several larger towns are drawing enough Latino
immigrants to defy the bleak demographic trends that have been
draining rural America.</TE>
<TE>   In almost every farm town with a meatpacking plant, migrant
workers arriving in just the last few years have fueled astounding
growth. The out-of-the-way community of Madison, Neb., has grown 11%
in the past decade to almost 2,400 as its Latino population surged
sixfold to more than 800.</TE>
<TE>   Worthington, Minn., expanded 13% to more than 11,000 people as
nearly 2,000 immigrants put down roots. On the far northeast fringe
of Iowa, tiny Postville is madly building homes; the population there
has swelled by 50% to more than 2,200 with the arrival of nearly 500
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   There are still many more Latinos in the Los Angeles region than
in the entire Midwest (4.2 million compared to 3 million). But the
Latino population in the heartland has nearly doubled in the last
decade. One Kansas meatpacking town, Dodge City, is now about 40%
Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders are often delighted, willing to work through the
inevitable strains for a chance to keep their schools open, their
playgrounds noisy, their Main Streets bustling.</TE>
<TE>   "Immigration is what's keeping us alive," said Bill Wright, school
superintendent in Denison.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, most immigrants soon find a way to make the
communities their own. They earn more money packing meat in Iowa than
picking berries in California. That's what attracts them to small
towns in the Corn Belt. But then they open their own restaurants,
sell Mexican sweets from small bakeries, import pinatas and dried
chiles to stock the shelves of the groceries they run.</TE>
<TE>   They urge their friends in Mexico to give Iowa a try -- and pretty
soon, it's home.</TE>
<TE>   There may not be a Spanish-language radio station within tuning
range. Or a single police officer she can communicate with, except in
makeshift sign language. But 27-year-old Nadia Castanela finds it
comfortable in Denison. She works here slicing pork eight hours a
day, six days a week. "It's a quiet town where we can live in peace,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it here," echoes Jose Ramon Regalado, 25, who works in a
meatpacking plant in Marshalltown in central Iowa. He went home for a
visit a few years ago and found he had more friends in Iowa than in
Mexico. "There were only four or five guys left in my village," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Midwesterners are often unsure whether to embrace the new arrivals
as saviors for bringing life back to fast-emptying towns -- or fear
them as outsiders who will change the community's character.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that tension more acute than in Iowa, where
demographers for years have been warning that, without immigration,
desolation looms.</TE>
<TE>   The state's population is shrinking and aging. Sixty percent of
Iowa's college graduates leave the state. The rural birthrate is low
-- in places, less than half the state average. At least 40% of
Iowa's cities lost population in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, Denison presents a striking contrast. New
homes are sold as soon as they're built; the mayor begs developers to
work faster. A $1.2-million early childhood education center just
opened. New soccer fields are in the works and the town is planning a
skateboard park.</TE>
<TE>   Denison's population rose 11% in the 1990s -- propelled almost
entirely by immigrants drawn by the three meat-processing plants. A
decade ago, Latinos made up just 2% of the population. Today the
official figure is 17%, and local officials say it may actually be
double that. More than half of the children in this year's
kindergarten class speak primarily Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "The packinghouses are our bread and butter. We rely on the
Hispanics who work there to grow our community," said Sue Pitts,
director of the Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same story in half a dozen other small communities across
Iowa. In rural Tama, population 2,700, the Latino population has
grown from a handful to 263 over the last decade. Mayor Richard
Gibson warns that a housing shortage could develop. "It's a challenge
that a lot of communities our size would like to have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even cities big enough not to fear for their survival rely on
Latino workers to keep their economies humming.</TE>
<TE>   Marshalltown, population 26,000, has absorbed a remarkable surge
in immigrants -- more than 3,000 in the last decade by census
numbers, and twice that by local estimates. Such growth has allowed
the local packinghouse to expand and sustain a $60-million annual
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether people like it or not, Marshalltown would certainly
suffer if those jobs went away," Police Chief Lon Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   The influx came into tragic focus last week with the discovery of
11 bodies in a railroad grain car that arrived in Denison after four
months in storage. Among the dead were two Mexican cousins who had
paid a smuggler to sneak them onto the train in the hopes of reaching
construction jobs in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   They could just as easily have been aiming for the Midwestern
packinghouses.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grey, who has studied the trend for years, estimates that
from 30% to 60% of the immigrants in Iowa are in the United States
illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders "seem to realize that this phenomenon is here to
stay -- and that these immigrants are critical to the economic and
social health of their communities," said Grey, a professor of
anthropology at the University of Northern Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Yet complaints that Iowa is fast becoming another California echo
loud. A statewide poll by the Des Moines Register last year found 54%
of respondents opposed to any increase in immigration.</TE>
<TE>   When Gov. Tom Vilsack proposed recruiting 300,000 foreigners to
bolster the state's labor force, public outrage forced him to
retreat.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Denison, many locals relish the chance to taste fajitas
and learn more about their new neighbors. Some are even studying
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   But there is resentment as well.</TE>
<TE>   Mariela Pacheco, 24, a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, feels it.
"The majority of people are very good. But there are others who look
at us not as equals," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ken Livingston senses the anger too. He hears it in the
rumors he is forever swatting down: The Mexicans are all on welfare;
the Mexicans pay no taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of old wives' tales," Livingston says wearily, insisting
that health care, law enforcement and other services are not strained
by the new residents. Under federal law, even legal immigrants have
limited access to public assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigrants, of course, avoid taxes by working in
under-the-table jobs. But those in the meatpacking plants and other
jobs -- whether legal or not -- pay federal, state and local taxes,
just like anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Their children require bilingual aides at school, but Supt. Wright
says the money the state pays the district for each new student more
than covers the cost. In fact, thanks to the growing enrollment, he
can maintain art, sports and music programs that other rural
districts have long since cut.</TE>
<TE>   But the tensions persist.</TE>
<TE>   Denison is a town where the newspaper prints a police blotter so
exhaustive it lists a sweatshirt stolen at a homecoming dance and
explains in detail how Carol Ann Williams drove her 1999 Plymouth
Breeze into a concrete wall at the Hy-Vee market.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, everyone doesn't just know everyone, they know
everyone's business too.</TE>
<TE>   The new migrants threaten that cozy insularity.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mexicans have inundated us," complains Jerry Brus, 58, a
local farmer. "They're taking over the town."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, folks born and raised in northwestern Iowa hear the buzz
of Spanish behind them and more Spanish in front of them as they wait
in line to cash a check, mail a letter or buy a quart of milk.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what they're saying," A.E. Haptonstall, 72, says
angrily, stabbing his cigarette butt in an ashtray at Cronk's Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, JoAnn, 69, tries to soothe him. "It's just change," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Their friend, Ronald Totten, interrupts. "We can't change as fast
as this," he says bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, 64, can pinpoint the precise year the change began --
1981. That's when the biggest packinghouse in town slashed wages.</TE>
<TE>   Meat-processing jobs used to be coveted here. Even without a high
school degree, packinghouse jobs paid up to $13 an hour -- good money
in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Every driveway had either a motorboat or a snowmobile or a camper
in the yard. The money was flowing," recalls Jerry Arn, 62, who moved
to Denison in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The good times ended soon after. The giant meat-processing firm
IBP introduced new methods that transformed the work into a
low-skill, assembly-line grind. Plants cut wages by up to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   The packinghouse jobs no longer looked so good. In any case, the
local labor pool was beginning to dry up. The farm crisis of the
1980s drove countless rural families into cities. Parents began to
push their kids into college.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for employees, meatpackers sent buses to recruit workers
in Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border. By the mid-'80s, many plants
in Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas were staffed mostly with Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, word spread about similar jobs in Iowa and
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Migrant workers fed up with California's expensive housing headed
for the Midwest, joining a steady stream of newcomers direct from
Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Today, immigrants work nearly half the packinghouse jobs in
Denison, most of them earning a minimum of $9 an hour plus benefits.</TE>
<TE>   It's a life that satisfies 26-year-old Juan Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez arrived in 1997 after three years in California, where he
had worked in the fields at a Watsonville nursery for $4.50 an hour.
At first, he said, he felt uneasy in Iowa. The Latino population was
so small. Some locals gave him dirty looks. The winter cold took him
by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   But Sanchez was soon trimming pork in Denison for $13.80 an hour,
more than double today's minimum wage. Rent is cheap. The town feels
safe. The rural landscape resembles central Mexico. "I'm already used
to it here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As they settle into new lives as Midwesterners, Denison's
immigrants often find their way to the battered trailer where Joe and
Rosie Chavez sell beans, salsa and other staples.</TE>
<TE>   The Chavezes were among the first Latinos in town, arriving from
Mexico in 1963. Rosie worked for the packinghouses. Joe, a mechanic,
learned English and made friends quickly. He worked for the city for
years and coached Little League. They put their six kids through
college.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Chavez, now 69, is eager to help this recent wave of newcomers
make it here too.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them, with papers, without papers, come here and work --
you can do well in this country. You can make it a community," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Denison, it's my home."</TE>

<HD>Mormons to Appeal Ruling on Use of Plaza</HD>
<DH>Court said sidewalk in front of the downtown Salt Lake City
building should be open to free speech. Church maintains that because
it owns the block, it can regulate the conduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mormon Church asked the full U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals
on Wednesday to review a ruling by a three-judge appellate panel that
the sidewalks of the church-owned Main Street plaza must remain open
to free speech, even if it offends Mormon beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   In the appeal, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
cited an earlier 10th Circuit case that it says conflicts with the
Main Street ruling. The Main Street case should be reviewed by the
full court to clear up the inconsistency, the church argued.</LD>
<LD>   Church attorney Von Keetch admits that the odds of a successful
appeal are slim.</LD>
<TE>   "We think this is a case that presents the kind of question the
court ought to hear," Keetch said. "In pure statistics, the battle is
uphill. We're just taking it a step at a time."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 9, the 10th Circuit panel ruled that Main Street plaza
sidewalks are traditional public spaces. The court said restricting
free speech on the easements held by the city for public access was
unconstitutional, even though the plaza was owned by the church.</TE>
<TE>   It was the city's job to regulate behavior on the public
easements, the court ruled. But the city couldn't create a "1st
Amendment-free zone," despite promises made to the church when the
city sold the plaza, the three-judge panel ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed sidewalks run in front of the Mormon temple in the
heart of downtown Salt Lake City and are landscaped and maintained by
the church.</TE>
<TE>   The church bought the tract from the city in 1999, transforming it
into a plaza with fountains and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials also outlawed smoking, sunbathing, bicycling and
"engaging in any illegal, offensive, indecent, obscene, vulgar, lewd
or disorderly speech, dress or conduct."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders also had granted the church exclusive rights to
distribute literature and broadcast speeches and music on the block.</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel struck down those restrictions as
unconstitutional. Now the full 10th Circuit court will decide whether
to review the case. If the court declines, the church could ask the
U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1999 Denver case, the church said, the appeals court found
that a "1st Amendment public forum does not exist on a secular plaza"
formed when the city created a pedestrian plaza by closing a street
that ran through the campus of the Denver Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   Former American Civil Liberties Union attorney Stephen C. Clark,
who continues to work on the case, said the church's use of the
Denver case isn't surprising, but that the two plazas are strikingly
different. He described the Denver plaza as a covered, elevated
terrace that serves as an "extended lobby" for the Denver Performing
Arts Center rather than a public thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   The church filed its appeal a day after Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky
Anderson said he would not rewrite the contract in which the city
sold the plaza to the church while maintaining public access
easements.</TE>

<HD>California Poet Favored to Lead Arts Agency</HD>
<DH>A 'working-class kid from L.A.' is Bush's intended nominee
for NEA chairman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California poet and arts critic Dana Gioia, who describes himself as
a "working-class kid from L.A.," is President Bush's intended nominee
for chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the White House
announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the anticipated nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Gioia, a
51-year-old Santa Rosan, would be the first poet to head the federal
agency, said NEA spokeswoman Victoria Hutter. The agency has been run
by an acting chairman since January, when Bush appointee Michael P.
Hammond died one week into the job.</LD>
<LD>   With the nomination pending, Gioia (pronounced JOY-a) declined to
comment, except to say in a telephone interview: "I'm delighted and
honored. I consider the National Endowment for the Arts an absolutely
invaluable American institution. If confirmed by the Senate, I will
be proud to do my best to lead it.... It would be inappropriate to
talk about the NEA or government arts policy at this point. When Sen.
[Edward M.] Kennedy asks me questions, I'll be happy to give him my
ideas."</LD>
<TE>   A cultural commentator for BBC Radio and classical music critic
for San Francisco magazine, Gioia is best known for his provocative
1991 essay in the Atlantic Monthly, "Can Poetry Matter?" The essay,
in which he declared that poetry was no longer a cultural force in
the country and was the province of only an insular group of poets,
gave him the reputation as a provocateur in some circles -- "I am the
most widely attacked poet of my generation," he acknowledged to The
Times last year -- and a visionary in others.</TE>
<TE>   Gioia's nomination was hailed by eminent literary figures such as
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Richard Wilbur, a former U.S. poet
laureate. Wilbur noted that Gioia is not a "vague, fuzzy-eyed poet,"
but a former vice president of General Foods and founder and
co-director of West Chester University's Summer Conference on Form
and Narrative in Pennsylvania, the nation's largest annual all-poetry
writing conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that Dana Gioia is about the most qualified person
around for the job, and I think he'll do it beautifully," Wilbur
said. Gioia, a father of two, said he is a Republican, but "a very
unpolitical person."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a writer, an artist and intellectual. I've never been
involved in politics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Hawthorne and often speaks about the importance of
writing with a California voice. The son of an Italian American
cabdriver father and a Mexican American mother, he said he has had a
lifelong and wide interest in the cultural and literary arts. "My
poor dad used to work six days a week," Gioia said. "I would convince
him after working 12 hours to drive me to UCLA so I could see a
screening of Fritz Lang or hear a talk, or have my mother and dad
drive me to a museum to a Matisse show."</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Mary Hiecke Gioia, regularly attend theater,
opera and ballet productions.</TE>
<TE>   He has an MBA from Stanford and a master's degree in comparative
literature from Harvard. His controversial Atlantic essay also spun
off a book of the same name, "Can Poetry Matter?" a collection of
essays on poetry and American culture.</TE>
<TE>   His nomination for the four-year term would be subject to
confirmation by the Senate, which is not expected to consider it
until next year.</TE>
<TE>   The nomination first would be considered by the Senate Committee
on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which will be chaired by
Kennedy (D-Mass.) if Democrats retain Senate control in the Nov. 5
elections.</TE>
<TE>   James Manley, a Kennedy spokesman, said the senator "needs to sit
down and talk to Mr. Gioia about what kind of role he sees this
agency having in promoting culture and the arts in this country."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s and early '90s, the NEA gave grants to several
artists who worked with sexually explicit themes, including Robert
Mapplethorpe, and what was soon called the "culture wars" pitted
these artists against conservative and religious leaders.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Porn Star Gets 90 Days on Insider Stock Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former porn star who admitted profiting from insider information
she received from a Wall Street executive was sentenced Wednesday to
three months in prison.</LD>
<LD>   "I did a lot of wrong things, but I'm an adventurous Aries and a
Canadian," Kathryn Gannon, who appeared in several adult films, said
outside federal court. "I'm going to go to jail with my head up high,
and I'm going to be the captain of my cell block."</LD>
<LD>   Gannon, 33, said she hoped the sentence would restore her flagging
finances.</LD>
<TE>   "There is going to be a movie made about my life story," she said.
"Jail time actually promotes it even better -- ching, ching!"</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Plans Stiff Punishment for Those Who Leak Secrets</HD>
<DH>Civil penalties and threats of firing are likely to help
stop disclosures, attorney general tells Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Wednesday he plans a new
and more aggressive effort to punish those who leak national security
secrets, but he told Congress he does not need new legislation to do
so.</LD>
<LD>   "Detecting and punishing unauthorized disclosures of U.S. national
security secrets [is] among our highest priorities, at all times, but
especially in this time of war against terrorism of global reach,"
Ashcroft said in a letter to leaders of the House and Senate.</LD>
<LD>   To deter leaks, Ashcroft said government employees who handle
classified information will be obliged to sign nondisclosure
agreements that expose them to financial penalties and perjury
charges if they are caught divulging secrets.</LD>
<TE>   "This will send a signal that if they knowingly leak, there will
be consequences," a Justice Department spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Large numbers of government employees already are required to sign
routine nondisclosure forms, but there is no effective penalty for
violators, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the government can bring criminal charges against someone
who divulges a secret that damages national security. However,
prosecuting such a case in a public trial puts a spotlight on
information the government wants to keep hidden.</TE>
<TE>   In his report to Congress, Ashcroft said he had concluded that
civil penalties and threats of firing are likely to work better at
deterring leaks than a new criminal law.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have given the
government the power to prosecute anyone who revealed "any classified
information," including whistle-blowers and ambassadors who briefed
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to shut down leaks, but that bill was overly
broad," said former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, leaders of the Senate and House intelligence committees
asked Ashcroft to look into the problem of "unauthorized disclosures
of classified information" and to advise them on whether a law was
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vindication of President Clinton's veto by John
Ashcroft," said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on
Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists.
"Clinton decided that we didn't need an official secrets act, and
Ashcroft agrees. The solution is not new legislation. And that comes
as a relief."</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), who lead
the Senate Intelligence Committee, were traveling Wednesday and were
not available to comment on Ashcroft's letter, aides said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Justice Department said it will do more to punish those
who leak information, officials concede they do not have a solution
to the most difficult problem: tracking down the source.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to track down the source of a leak," said a
government official who worked on the report. "You need to rule out
all the other possible sources to prove someone is the leaker. And no
one has found a practical way to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers on intelligence committees may be less enthused about
new criminal penalties for those who leak classified information, now
that such a probe has focused on them.</TE>
<TE>   They had asked the FBI to investigate after news reports revealed
the specific wording of an Al Qaeda transmission that was picked up
by the National Security Agency. The disclosure was seen as
particularly damaging because it could alert terrorists to how their
messages are intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI then asked senators and their staffs to submit to
polygraph tests. Several lawmakers balked at that request.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is ongoing, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Man Sought in Sniper Case; Search Spreads</HD>
<DH>Task force agents seek traces of ammunition in Tacoma,
Wash., yard as domestic terror angle is pursued. He may have
information in the case.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement task force officials hunting the
Washington-area killer issued an arrest warrant late Wednesday night
for an "armed and extremely dangerous" firearms suspect, then issued
another veiled plea to the slayer.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who heads the
sniper task force, said police issued an alert for John Allen
Muhammad, sought on "alleged violation of federal firearms laws."
Muhammad, 42, was described as black, 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Moose cautioned that Muhammad's arrest warrant "was not related to
the recent shootings under investigation" by the task force, but that
Muhammad "may have information material to our investigation." At the
same time, Moose spoke directly to the killer, who cryptically told
police he wanted to be described as caught "like a duck in a noose."</LD>
<TE>   Issuing a photograph showing a clean-shaven man with a cropped
haircut, the chief said Muhammad might be accompanied by a
17-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad, who also calls himself John Allen Williams, had served
in the military, a federal official said. The Pierce County, Wash.,
Sheriff's Office said Muhammad was once stationed at Ft. Lewis, an
Army post south of Tacoma, Wash. -- a base renowned for its training
for Army Rangers and snipers.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Stephen Barger, a Ft. Lewis spokesman, said that the base
has been asked by the FBI for assistance and "we are cooperating in
any way we can."</TE>
<TE>   Just hours earlier, FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents searched for traces of ammunition in the backyard of
a house in Tacoma as part of the murder probe across the country in
the Washington, D.C., area. The capital sniper has killed 10 and
wounded three since Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   A federal law enforcement official confirmed Wednesday night that
task force investigators have been focusing on domestic terrorism as
a potential motivating factor in the killings, and said that the
search in Tacoma was part of that possibility. "Among competing
theories, domestic terror is being strongly considered," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said there is no evidence that the killings are
linked to any domestic terrorist group. Instead, investigators are
examining the premise that the killers may be motivated by a desire
to embarrass law enforcement authorities, killing at will in an
effort to prove that the government's counter-terrorism efforts since
the Sept. 11 attacks are porous and easily evaded.</TE>
<TE>   "The theory is that these are people who think they're smarter
than the government," the official said. "It's domestic terror in
idea, not organization, the sense that someone is reacting to the new
focus on counter-terrorism and trying to prove that he or they can
outsmart us."</TE>
<TE>   Even amid the new flurry of investigative action, Moose took care
to address the elusive sniper who killed again Tuesday in Montgomery
County, felling a bus driver, 35, with his signature long-distance
single rifle shot.</TE>
<TE>   Moose hinted that police contacts with the sniper had been riddled
with breakdowns. He urged the suspect to be patient and stay in
touch.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that you communicated with us by calling several
different locations," Moose said. "Our inability to communicate has
been a concern to us, as well as it has been for you. You have
indicated that you wanted us to do and say certain things."</TE>
<TE>   Moose repeated a quote the killer demanded, saying: "You've asked
us to say, quote, We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose.
End quote. We understand that hearing us saying this is important to
you. However, we want you to know how difficult it has been to know
what you want because you have chosen to use only notes, indirect
messages and calls to other jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are reluctant to contact us, be assured that we remain
ready to talk directly with you," Moose said. "Our word is our bond."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents also swept into a Bellingham, Wash., high school
Wednesday, seeking possible connections to the sniper case, local
officials confirmed. Mayor Mark Asmundson said the FBI had told
Bellingham police they needed information on two people -- a male
teenager who reportedly briefly attended the school, and an older
man. Neither lived in the Bellingham area for long, and left the area
about nine months ago, the mayor said. It was unclear Wednesday night
if Muhammad was one of those.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's search by FBI and ATF agents in the suburban Tacoma
neighborhood was the latest in a series of searches that have been
conducted around the country in recent weeks as part of the sniper
task force probe, the federal law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the lead that brought investigators to Tacoma
was developed by task force detectives working to solve the killings
that have traumatized the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators sawed off a tree trunk in the backyard of the house,
wrapped it in plastic and hauled it away during the search, which
began Wednesday afternoon. Neighbors on Proctor Street said the
agents were apparently looking for bullet fragments.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Mallon, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Seattle office, said
that the current landlord and the tenant of the house consented to
the search. Mallon would not talk about the search, but acknowledged
that agents were interested in "the outside perimeter."</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor, Army Pfc. Christopher Waters, 23, said he called the
police early this year to report hearing nightly bursts of
"high-powered rifle fire" that went on for about a month. Waters, who
lives across the street from the property that was searched, said he
couldn't pinpoint the gunfire to that house.</TE>
<TE>   In the Alabama capital of Montgomery, Mayor Bobby Bright said he
was told federal authorities were investigating a Sept. 21 fatal
shooting at a liquor store that may be linked to the sniper. One
woman was killed and another wounded as they walked to their cars
after locking up the store. No one has been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials said that more than 1,300 federal agents have
been redeployed from throughout the nation and the world in the
sniper hunt. Maryland's governor was considering calling out the
National Guard to provide protection for voters on election day, as
the wrenching drama entered its fourth week.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic experts examining evidence from the body of bus driver
Conrad E. Johnson and from the latest slaying scene, which
investigators continued to comb Wednesday, confirmed that he was the
13th victim of a series of attacks in which the most distinct common
denominator is their ability to maximize public dread. Johnson was
killed with a single shot to the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Amid late-afternoon searches for a white box truck that again shut
down major commuter arteries, police investigating the latest
shooting issued yet another round of urgent appeals for witnesses.
Specifically, they called on undocumented immigrants in suburban
Aspen Hill, Md., who may have seen Tuesday's slaying to come forward.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service assured them they would
not risk deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by the hunters and the hunted to establish a dialogue
also continued Wednesday, as federal officials confirmed key details
indicating that those attempts may have been hampered by the probe
itself -- a massive, plodding and often unwieldy effort spanning two
states, a federal district and a half-dozen counties.</TE>
<TE>   A tip line that investigators set up soon after the killings began
in suburban Montgomery County, Md., has been jammed with more than
70,000 calls in three weeks, and Gary M. Bald, who heads the FBI's
Baltimore office, said Wednesday: "It's not unexpected that from time
to time the calls coming in will overtax the system."</TE>
<TE>   A letter left near the Virginia roadside steakhouse where a
traveler was shot by the sniper Saturday night chastised
investigators for "incompetence" in ignoring a half-dozen calls to
the tip line -- apparent attempts by the sniper to contact police,
according to federal officials and published reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Five people had to die because of it," the letter stated, adding
a demand that $10 million be deposited in a bank account or risk more
"body bags," those sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Moose, who used the media to engage in a lengthy, cryptic exchange
with the letter's author on Tuesday, appeared to confirm the money
demand. On Tuesday night, Moose stated: "We have researched the
options you stated and found that it is not possible electronically
to comply in the manner that you requested.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain open and ready to talk to you," he added, offering up
an exclusive toll-free telephone number or a post office box to ease
communication. "It is important that we do this without anyone else
getting hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Although he offered few additional details in his daily briefing
Wednesday, Moose suddenly scheduled another media session for 6 p.m.
That briefing was postponed, a spokeswoman said, "because of
developments in the case." Of the leaked details of the letter left
behind Saturday night -- and a second letter reportedly found at the
scene of Tuesday's killing -- Moose said, "I don't know where all
that is coming from.</TE>
<TE>   "Any calls to the tip line are held in the strictest of
confidentiality," he said. "To verify or not verify anything would
not be appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, visited the task force
headquarters in Rockville, Md., on Wednesday and asserted that
"cooperation is extraordinary" among the many agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigators on the case have the full support of just about
every federal agency there is, and we're making progress and we will
get this individual," Mueller added. He, too, provided no details.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's boss also weighed in Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the sniper as "the coldblooded killer running around in
the community in Washington," President Bush told a meeting on
cyber-safety at the White House that the killings have had an effect
on almost every life in every home in the region -- including his
own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's on people's minds here, and I'm worried about it," Bush told
the group. "A lot of people are worried about it. We've got a lot of
moms worried about it, fathers worried about it."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials tried to put up a defiant front.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing a real determination, resolve and even strength on
the part of the community," said Montgomery County Executive Doug
Duncan, who noted that bus drivers and other county employees showed
up for work Wednesday, some of them on their day off. "We're getting
through this together."</TE>
<TE>   But attendance was down at schools throughout the Washington area
-- some reporting double the normal absenteeism rates -- and many
students who did attend were dropped off and picked up by their
parents, rather than walk or ride a bus.</TE>
<TE>   If the killings continue until election day, Nov. 5, Maryland Gov.
Parris Glendening said he would consider posting National Guard
troops at polling stations to assure nervous voters. State officials
said it was the first time in memory that the state would call up the
National Guard for an election.</TE>
<TE>   And addressing that general and spreading angst, Bush added
Wednesday: "We've got to do something about it, and we are." White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer earlier laid out a laundry list of just
what the federal government is doing. In all, he said, it has
contributed 454 agents, 59 inspectors and nine sniffer-dogs and
handlers from the ATF, 600 FBI personnel and agents from the Drug
Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Customs Service has provided the sniper task force with
three helicopters, along with flight crews. The Defense Department
has "provided the air platforms to try to catch the killer" --
surveillance aircraft, Fleischer said. And the Department of
Education is offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in
discretionary grants to affected school districts in Maryland and
Virginia, money that can be used for anything from security to
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, FBI officials said their 600 agents now dedicated to
the sniper case were drawn from across the mid-Atlantic seaboard --
field offices in Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington and Newark, N.J.,
among others. An ATF spokesman said his bureau drew its forces with a
range of specialties from offices across the U.S. and around the
world. The ATF's ballistics lab in Rockville, the Montgomery County
seat, also has documented the critical evidence chain in the case by
positively connecting the bullet fragments or casings that have
linked the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the federal assistance in the case has been decidedly
low-tech. The tip line that federal officials set up, (888) 324-9800,
was clogged throughout the day Wednesday, with many calls hitting a
busy signal. And the system for recording the tips and distributing
the information throughout the vast network of investigators on the
case, a system dubbed Rapid Start, relies on some distinctly mid-20th
century methods.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone workers, who include FBI trainees and others assigned to
boiler rooms, record each tip on a triplicate form that uses carbon
paper and is sorted for various levels of priority and for various
field offices.</TE>
<TE>   The agency then dispatches drivers to take the tip sheets to
centers in Montgomery County, Fairfax County, Va., and Richmond, Va.</TE>

<HD>Fear of Violence Shifts From Town to Country</HD>
<DH>Washington area has been turned inside out. Urban mean
streets are safe haven and the suburbs have become the combat zone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- As dusk brings a chilly darkness down over the
Anacostia River, the panhandlers in front of Steve Chon's corner
market burrow deeper into smeared parkas; the men pop their beer cans
in paper sacks. And as the evening news repeats the saga of the
elusive sniper, residents of these D.C. streets say they've never
felt safer.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have to worry about snipers here," says Chon, stacking
six-packs into his glass cases. "Especially where I'm at."</LD>
<LD>   The urban enclaves around RFK Stadium and Anacostia aren't exactly
known as havens of community safety. People who don't live in
southeast D.C. generally steer clear, frightened off by the gun
violence and drug crimes that plague the troubled neighborhoods. Most
days, the residents here are widely regarded as the vulnerable ones.
But these aren't ordinary times. The Beltway sniper's random gunfire
has temporarily stood the conventional wisdom of urban crime on its
ear -- and effectively turned Washington inside out. Suddenly, it is
the suburbs -- the snug, smug domestic grids designed as sanctuaries
from the dangerous District -- that have become skittery combat
zones.</LD>
<TE>   "Ironic, isn't it?" says 31-year-old Victoria Cooper, a secretary
who paused on a southeast street corner with cut flowers. "It is so
ironic that now it's safer to shop in the inner city."</TE>
<TE>   Gun violence is, of course, still primarily an urban phenomenon.
Sooner or later, the sniper will slip up or stop shooting, and life
in the suburbs will resume its insular feel. But not now.</TE>
<TE>   White-collar commuters are ferrying their children to playgrounds
in the heart of the city because they are afraid to let them roam the
leafy lawns back home. Government workers have taken to hauling home
bags of groceries from downtown markets and plowing through thick
traffic to fill their gas tanks in the safety of the city -- shopping
centers in Virginia and Maryland suddenly seemed too vulnerable. Last
weekend, the lines to get into the downtown museums were thicker than
usual as frazzled families trooped into the city, eager to let their
guard down and relax.</TE>
<TE>   These days, people such as Cooper and Chon are counting the
virtues of their gritty neighborhoods. The narrow streets provide no
easy getaway, they point out. Besides, they say, people around here
are skilled at spotting a suspicious stranger, at catching on -- and
slipping away -- when they realize that an outsider is up to no good.</TE>
<TE>   And so they watch as the rest of the region freezes into a state
of controlled panic.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just joking about this," said Bob Howard. Clad in a
three-piece suit and leather cap, the retired guidance counselor
stopped in to visit his buddies at Langston Golf Course in southeast
Washington recently .</TE>
<TE>   "They're wringing their hands," he said, gesturing at the
clubhouse television, which blared yet another report about the
sniper. "They're really bemoaning that this is happening out there,
where it's supposed to be safer."</TE>
<TE>   Howard and his wife live behind a thick fence in Congress Heights.
They lock the gate at all hours -- when Howard's wife nears home, she
calls from her mobile phone, and he lets her in. "But I've never felt
unsafe," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people most people are afraid of are my neighbors and my
three sons."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's capital is a murderous city, a place where thousands
of gun crimes unfold each year. The city of 67 square miles has
logged 200 homicides in 2002. About a third of those occurred in
neighborhoods along the Anacostia River, which cuts across the
southeastern corner of town. Here, graceful old row houses have
gradually given way to boarded windows, graffiti and shattered panes.</TE>
<TE>   "This sniper is the sort of thing that goes on in our
neighborhoods," says resident James Culley, 60. "You more or less
expect it. Now, out in Montgomery County, you don't expect it."</TE>
<TE>   Suburbs have been retreats from the dangers of the metropolis ever
since the wealthy families of ancient Rome built pastoral sanctuaries
-- villa surbana -- far from the city. But recent years have
witnessed widespread rejuvenation of America's historic downtowns and
warehouse districts, coupled with a surge of crime in the crumbling
neighborhoods of the nation's older suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper is a harsh reminder that guns are ubiquitous -- and
that tree-lined tranquillity isn't a promise of security.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changing people's perceptions about life in the inner city
versus life in the suburbs," said Cooper. "I'm from the suburbs, so I
know the thought of being isolated in your own enclave. And, really,
that's a self-delusion."</TE>
<TE>   The faceless gunman stalks suburbanites at gas stations, grassy
lawns and schoolyards. Just one of the 13 victims was gunned down in
the District of Columbia proper, and a Washington police spokesman
said Pascal Charlot was killed by a bullet fired over the border from
Maryland. It suddenly seems fruitless -- menacing, even -- to retreat
to the wide streets, neat shopping centers and open spaces that
usually testify to affluence and security.</TE>
<TE>   A woman in a baggy jacket lurches in off the street, smiles
crookedly at a customer standing near the candy aisle and throws her
arms around the stranger's neck. Chon's daughter rolls her eyes. "She
hugs everybody," the girl says. "It's because she wants money."</TE>
<TE>   The Chon family opened the corner grocery back in 1984, then
peered through the doorway as "just about the whole town packed up
and moved out," Chon says. They watched as drug warfare emptied the
streets and commuters shuttled out of the city at sundown. They heard
gunfire crackle and echo in the alleyways.</TE>
<TE>   "This is equality for you," Chon says of the sniper. "Perfect
equality."</TE>
<TE>   In Alexandria, the Guardian Angels are leaning against the pumps
of a nearly deserted Texaco. They watch rush hour clog the wide
avenues that hem the filling station. This is where the city tapers
into wooded suburb, where neat gates ring condominiums and shiny
high-rises loom from the trees.</TE>
<TE>   It is hardly the usual stomping ground for these civilian guards
in their trademark berets and stiff red windbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually," says regional director Wilka Claro, "we're in the
ghetto. In my assignments, in my experience, it's the inner city."</TE>
<TE>   But, she said with a shrug, "times have changed."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>A woman caught on videotape allegedly beating her 4-year-old daughter
must undergo counseling and take classes in parenting and rage
control before she can regain custody of the child, a judge ordered
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Probate Judge Peter Nemeth also ordered Madelyne Gorman Toogood to
maintain stable housing, keep consistent contact with the state
Office of Family and Children and visit her daughter Martha
regularly. She also must complete a parenting assessment.</LD>
<LD>   Toogood, 25, and her husband, John, 29, belong to the Irish
Travelers, a nomadic group. They have been living in Mishawaka six
months.</LD>
<TE>   John Toogood was ordered to maintain a stable job, stable housing,
complete a parenting assessment and follow its recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The Toogoods wouldn't comment Wednesday, but agreed to the
stipulations. If they meet the court's demands they likely will be
reunited with their daughter, who is living with a relative.</TE>

<HD>That Ringing in Their Ears Is an Opportunity Lost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Could you see the ring?</LD>
<LD>   There it was, through the chill and mist and dull silence of a
stunned crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Did you see it shine? The Angels surely saw it. They had to see
it.</LD>
<TE>   A world championship ring, at their gloved fingertips, within
their 42-year-long grasp.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth inning, a 3-0 lead over the San Francisco Giants, their
starter rolling, their bullpen rested, 15 outs from taking a
three-games-to-one lead, putting the squeeze on this World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The ring was there.</TE>
<TE>   And then it was gone.</TE>
<TE>   It slipped out of their hands and down to the wet grass and by the
time they fell to their knees to retrieve it, the renewed fans
stomping and hooting around them, the ring had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   It was kicked away by the Giants in a 4-3 victory Wednesday that
changed everything.</TE>
<TE>   This deal is even now. Jason Schmidt, today's power pitcher who
slowed the Angels in Game 1, can do real damage now. The Angels
should be worried now.</TE>
<TE>   Said the Giants' Tim Worrell: "This was a momentum shift."</TE>
<TE>   Said the Angels' John Lackey: "This was no big deal. We've been
here before."</TE>
<TE>   Whom do we believe? The problem is, we have also been here before.
And while we promised to never again talk about curses and jinxes,
well, goodness....</TE>
<TE>   Did you see that funk in the fifth inning? Did you see that
Frankie in the eighth inning?</TE>
<TE>   Everything that had gone right for the Angels suddenly didn't.
Their hands were soft, their minds were wandering, their kid fell of
his bike.</TE>
<TE>   Now it is the Giants who have those wide eyes and huge grins.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys wouldn't write us off, would you?" asked Giant second
baseman Jeff Kent, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was the Angels who were eating their postgame chicken and
rice in silence on tiny tables surrounded by hundreds of reporters
waiting for answers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mind-set is the same," claimed Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   If this is indeed the case, then that is the only thing that
Wednesday night didn't change.</TE>
<TE>   Start with the fifth inning. Start with the leadoff-hitting Kirk
Rueter.</TE>
<TE>   He banged a ball off home plate, it hopped out into the thick turf
and died, but there was still time for catcher Bengie Molina to grab
it and perhaps throw Rueter out at first.</TE>
<TE>   Except Molina didn't grab for the ball, Lackey grabbed for the
ball and, falling away and off balance, he had no chance.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, who later grounded into an inning-ending double play and
had a passed ball that put the eventual winning run into scoring
position, took the blame for the loss.</TE>
<TE>   But on a night when none of them seemed able to stick their spikes
on the Giant throats, there was enough blame to go around.</TE>
<TE>   "Rueter's hit was just a hang-with-'em play, nothing we could do
about it," said Lackey, kindly.</TE>
<TE>   Next up, Kenny Lofton, who bunted a ball that rolled down the
third-base line ... and rolled ... and rolled ... and was picked up
by Troy Glaus in fair territory.</TE>
<TE>   The ball appeared to roll into foul territory just before Glaus
grabbed it, but it was fair when he touched it, so of course you
wonder if he just hadn't grabbed it a second sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus said it was not about baseball, but geography.</TE>
<TE>   "Their line is a little lower than the dirt," Glaus said. "It went
foul. As I grabbed it, it rolled back down the line."</TE>
<TE>   What followed next was a collection of three line drives
surrounded by an intentional walk, bringing in the three runs. To
complete an inning of both physical and mental mistakes, Lackey was
out of position while backing up Molina on a wild throw home by Tim
Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   When is the last time you've seen an Angel do that?</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the bullpen didn't move.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago's score-tying single came on Lackey's 86th pitch.</TE>
<TE>   And then Ben Weber started throwing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no sense of urgency here," Lackey said, and after that
inning, you must believe him.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, the Angels probably figured that Francisco
Rodriguez would eventually come into the game and freeze the Giants
long enough for some guy in red to hit a game-winning homer.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't we all?</TE>
<TE>   But that's not what happened, because Rodriguez didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   This was not K-Rod, this was Odd Rod.</TE>
<TE>   Of 30 pitches in two innings, he threw barely a handful of
fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, he was beaten for a single by J.T. Snow on an
81-mph slider. Then he was beaten on a 97-mph fastball that didn't
move.</TE>
<TE>   All the moving happened later, as the Giants sprinted on to the
field in celebration while the Angels trudged away in wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "All we talked before the game, all that mattered was that this
was a must-win," Worrell said. "It wasn't really, but it was about as
close as you could come."</TE>
<TE>   Considering giving the more experienced team three wins in a World
Series is like allowing them to start their parade, that must-win
mandate rests today with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Not really, but as close as you can come.</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- When will "Star Spangled Banner"
singers learn that it's not the time for them to show off their
voices? It's not an audition for "American Idol." David Eckstein
grounded to short. Darin Erstad grounded to second. Tim Salmon
grounded to third. Bell made a low throw to first and J.T. Snow
couldn't dig it out. Error on Bell. Snow usually makes that play.
Eric Karros would have pulled his foot off the bag and been running
back to the dugout before the ball even got there. Garret Anderson,
grounded a single to center, Salmon taking third. The Angels go from
first to third better than any team in years. Troy Glaus grounded to
second, Jeff Kent flipped to Rich Aurilia for the force at second. No
runs, one hit, one error, two left.</LD>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Kenny Lofton beat out a slow roller
to second. After failing on a sacrifice attempt, Aurilia singled to
right, Lofton taking third. With the Angels scoring eight runs a
game, playing for one run doesn't make sense. Kent struck out
swinging. At last count, Kent has stranded 1,247 runners on base in
this World Series. Barry Bonds was intentionally walked. For those of
you scoring at home, and those of you alone, that makes two IBB's for
Bonds in the last two games, and two for Bengie Molina. Benito
Santiago grounded into a 6-3 double play. That was huge. After
watching him take the ball to second, you had the feeling Eckstein
said to himself "No way I'm throwing this to Benji Gil." No runs, two
hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Giants 0 -- Scott Spiezio hit a bouncer up the
middle, Aurilia made a nice play to get him. Gil singled to right.
Bengie Molina used his nine-iron to hit a ball that was in the dirt
into center, Gil to second. Tiger Woods couldn't have done it better.
John Lackey, who has never batted as a pro before, SINGLED TO RIGHT!
Kirk Rueter should just retire now. Now Lackey has more key hits in
this Series than Jeff Kent. The bases are loaded. Eckstein flied to
short center, Gil scored on a terrible throw by Lofton. Venus de Milo
has a better arm than Lofton. Erstad grounded to the pitcher. One
run, three hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 1, Giants 0 -- Snow grounded to first. Some fans in
the stands have black and orange noise sticks. Can't they come up
with their own ideas? They have to steal the noise sticks gig from
Angel fans? Reggie Sanders singled up the middle. Bell's bat
shattered on a grounder to short. The bat almost hit Glaus as
Eckstein threw to first for the out. Sanders to second. Rueter
grounded to second and ran hard to make it a close play at first. But
he was out. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 0 -- The Taco Bell target is still in
McCovey Cove. The folks at Target should put a big taco in McCovey
Cove, just to get even. Salmon singled to center. Anderson hit a slow
roller to second, Kent got the force at second. Glaus homered to
center. Finally, Glaus homers with someone on base. Lofton glared at
a fan, apparently believing the fan prevented him from making the
catch. Lofton's ego goes up the more his playing ability goes down.
Spiezio lined to center. Gil singled to center. Gil is seven for 10
in the postseason. Molina flied to right. Two runs, three hits, one
left.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 3, Giants 0 -- Lofton singled to right. Aurilia hit
a drive to left-center that bounced off the heel of Erstad's glove on
his diving attempt at a catch. It was a great try by Erstad. Anderson
was right there to back him up and immediately grabbed the ball and
threw it in, preventing Lofton from scoring. Two good plays by Angel
outfielders. Runners on second and third. Kent lined back to the
pitcher. Bonds was walked intentionally, thereby passing Molina in
the intentional walk sweepstakes. Santiago grounded into a 6-4-3
double play. The Giants just can't seem to get a clutch hit. No runs,
two hits, three left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 0 -- You would think Tim McCarver would
have learned a little something about silence in all his years
catching Steve Carlton. Lackey grounded to the pitcher. Eckstein
tried to bunt for a hit, but Bell threw him out. Erstad grounded to
second. A quick inning. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 3, Giants 0-- They just showed the MasterCard Most
Memorable Moment commercial. The campaign is over! Voting has ended!
Ripken won! Stop with the commercial! Stop! Snow grounded to second.
Sanders flied to right. Bell flied to left. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 0 -- Salmon took strike three. Anderson
singled to shallow left. Glaus grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. No
runs, one hit.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 3, Giants 3 -- Rueter hit a chopper off the plate
between first and the mound. He beat the throw to first. Lofton
bunted down the third-base line. The ball hugged the line, then went
foul by about an inch, but by the time Glaus picked it up, the ball
had just caught a piece of the line again and was a fair ball. Good
call by the ump, and great camera work by Fox. It's the best thing
Fox has done the whole Series. Runners on first and second. Aurilia
singled to right, Rueter scored, Lofton to third. Kent flied to
right, Lofton scored. Molina just watched as the ball went by him,
allowing Aurilia to take second. Molina did point out where the ball
was going to Lackey. Bonds was walked intentionally. Santiago singled
to center, Erstad's throw home hit the mound or they might have had
Aurilia at the plate. Bonds to second. Snow flied to right. Bonds
could have tagged and taken third, but didn't. Sanders struck out
swinging. Three runs, four hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 3-- Spiezio singled to center. After
failing on two sacrifice attempts, Gil struck out. Molina hit a shot
to first, which Snow beautifully turned into a 3-6-1 double play.
Snow should be working for Allstate. No runs, one hit.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 3, Giants 3 -- Ben Weber pitching. The cast members
of "Firefly" are at the game. They are longtime Giant fans. They
aren't there and in great seats just because their show is on Fox.
Bell lined a ball down the left-field line. Anderson hustled to get
the ball and threw Bell out at second. Tom Goodwin, batting for
Rueter, walked. That's one more walk than he drew when he was with
the Dodgers. With Lofton batting, Goodwin stole second. Lofton flied
to center, Goodwin to third. Aurilia lined to third, Glaus made a
nice leaping catch for the out. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 3 -- Felix Rodriguez pitching. Orlando
Palmeiro, batting for Weber, struck out. Eckstein popped to second.
Erstad grounded to first. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 3, Giants 3 -- Francisco Rodriguez pitching. Kent
struck out swinging. Bonds grounded to first. That's why you pitch to
him. Rodriguez gave him five consecutive sliders. Bonds grounded out
on a 2-and-2 pitch. Santiago flied to left. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Giants 3 -- Tim Worrell pitching. If you're a
Dodger fan, the phrase "Worrell is pitching" still makes you cringe.
Salmon flied to right-center, Lofton made a nice running catch.
Anderson grounded to first. Glaus flied to left. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 3 -- Snow singled to right. The first
pitch to Sanders got by Molina for a passed ball, Snow to second.
Sanders squared around to bunt, which might have distracted Molina,
but a major league catcher has to catch that pitch. Sanders popped a
bunt attempt into foul territory, Spiezio made a great play to catch
the ball. Why is Sanders bunting in that situation? That's not why
Reggie Sanders is on the team. If you want someone to bunt, send in
Shinjo to hit for him. Bell singled to center, Snow scoring on the
ugliest slide you will ever see. Ramon Martinez, batting for Worrell,
struck out and Bell was thrown out trying to steal. Molina has a
great arm, but the run the Giants scored is on his shoulders. One
run, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 3 -- Robb Nen pitching. Spiezio fouled to
third. Adam Kennedy singled to right. Fullmer, batting for Molina,
grounded into a tailor-made 6-3 double play. No runs, one hit. It's
now a best-of-three Series.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Would Be Ready for Game 7</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the World Series extends to seven games, and if the Angels wish to
use Ramon Ortiz as their starter in Game 7, he is expected to be
available.</LD>
<LD>   The right-hander complained of stiffness in his right wrist during
his Game 3 start Tuesday. The injury was diagnosed Wednesday as
tendinitis, and X-rays did not show any fracture. He is scheduled to
work out today, his usual day to throw between starts.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, said Ortiz was
treated for intermittent discomfort in his right forearm late in the
season. Ortiz did not miss a start or a throwing session between
starts. In his final nine starts, he went 6-0 with a 2.77 earned-run
average.</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz said his wrist felt "a little bit tight" Tuesday but said he
felt "fine" Wednesday. "I'm ready to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz earned the victory Tuesday, giving up four runs in five
innings. The Giants scored three of those runs in the bottom of the
fifth, and the Angels removed him for a pinch-hitter in the top of
the sixth, a decision Manager Mike Scioscia said was not related to
the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "That was purely performance-based," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is the likely starter for Game 7, on regular rest, but the
Angels have not ruled out bringing back rookie John Lackey on three
days' rest. The Angels also might wish to have Lackey available in
the bullpen for Games 6 and 7, in relief of Kevin Appier and Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the request of closer Troy Percival, the Angels do not employ
an exaggerated infield shift when he pitches. While the Angels have
defended Barry Bonds by moving second basemen Adam Kennedy and Benji
Gil into short right field, shortstop David Eckstein to second base
and third baseman Troy Glaus to shortstop, they played a normal
defensive alignment when Bonds batted against Percival in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Percival throws so hard that he believes a shift can be
counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes away a pitch from me," Percival said. "If I throw 97 low
and away, that's a hard pitch to pull. I prefer they play in their
normal spots."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' scouting reports support Percival, according to bench
coach Joe Maddon. While few ground balls might be hit to the opposite
side of the infield against him, Maddon said plenty of pop flies are
hit that way, so an infielder is needed to catch them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn starts -- and bats -- tonight for the Angels. He
had one hit in five at-bats this season, lowering his lifetime
average from .444 to .357.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many guys are .400 hitters," he said with a smile. "I'm not
Ted Williams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney is working with the city of Anaheim to stage a ceremony for
the Angels following the World Series, win or lose. The event is
expected to start at Disneyland and end at Edison Field, with a rally
in the parking lot outside the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are the World Series balls really juiced? San Francisco shortstop
Rich Aurilia suggests one way you can tell.</TE>
<TE>   "If you see Barry Bonds hit one out, I don't think anybody will
say anything," Aurilia said. "If you see -- and I mean this in a good
way -- David Eckstein hit four or five home runs, something might be
up."</TE>
<TE>   At that, Eckstein laughed. In his first World Series at-bat, the
Angel shortstop said, he suspected something might be up when his
line drive stayed aloft for Bonds to catch.</TE>
<TE>   "It made it to the outfield," he said. "That's how I knew."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add this to the list of amazing things about Francisco Rodriguez's
record-tying five postseason wins: Of the 10 pitchers who have
recorded at least four postseason victories, he is the only reliever.</TE>

<HD>Without Mo, It Has Been All Go</HD>
<DH>The Angels' best move on the road to the World Series may
have been the trade of Vaughn and his bad attitude to the Mets for
Appier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the defining moments for the Angels this season, one of the
most critical days in pointing the team toward its first World Series
occurred last year. On Dec. 27, 2001, the Angels traded first baseman
Mo Vaughn to the New York Mets for pitcher Kevin Appier.</LD>
<LD>   Vaughn had signed a six-year, $80-million contract with the
Angels, the richest deal in franchise history, but injuries and
controversy marked the first three years of the deal. Vaughn had worn
out his welcome by last fall, when he publicly declared his desire to
return to his beloved East Coast and privately told Angel General
Manager Bill Stoneman and Manager Mike Scioscia that he would refuse
to serve as a designated hitter.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it was good to get Mo out," pitcher Jarrod Washburn said
Wednesday, "just simply because he made it well known to everybody
that he didn't want to be there. I don't think we really wanted a guy
on our team that didn't want to be on our team.</LD>
<TE>   "So, any time you can rid yourselves of a problem or possible
problem like that, I think it's good for a team. Adding a guy like
Appier is just an extra bonus. When you're able to get rid of a
distraction and add a quality guy like Kevin Appier, I think that was
a great move."</TE>
<TE>   In an expletive-filled diatribe in spring training, Vaughn ripped
closer Troy Percival in general and the Angels in particular. Of
Percival, Vaughn said, "He hasn't done ... to lead them anywhere. I
got hardware, I got playoff appearances, I got an MVP, I've been to
the playoffs twice."</TE>
<TE>   Of the Angels, he said, "They ain't got no flags hanging at Edison
Field."</TE>
<TE>   In his two playoff appearances for Boston, Vaughn failed to lead
the Red Sox out of the first round. The Mets finished in last place
this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets are scheduled to play in Anaheim next season, so Percival
will be able to point to the pennant hanging at Edison Field. He just
might be able to show Vaughn a World Series championship ring.</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Isn't Invincible Now</HD>
<DH>Usually commanding right-hander insists he's unshaken after
the heartbreak of Bell's game-winning single.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>This was Fort Knox being broken into, the CIA's main-frame computer
being hacked, an electrical fence lined with barbwire being scaled.</LD>
<LD>   The irresistible force that was Angel reliever Francisco Rodriguez
is no longer an immovable object, and a World Series that seemed well
within the Angels' grasp in the early innings Wednesday night is now
spinning out of their control.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, the kid with the golden arm, the right-hander with the
blazing fastball, vicious slider, 5-0 playoff record and 1.38
earned-run average, was reduced to a mere mortal in Game 4, giving up
David Bell's game-winning RBI single in the eighth inning of a 4-3
loss to the San Francisco Giants before 42,703 in Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Relying almost exclusively on his slider -- of his 30 pitches,
only a few were fastballs -- Rodriguez gave up a leadoff single to
J.T. Snow in the eighth. Snow took second on catcher Bengie Molina's
passed ball and scored when Bell turned on a rare Rodriguez fastball,
this one clocking at 97 mph, and lined it to center field for a 4-3
lead. Closer Robb Nen recorded the save, and the best-of-seven series
is now even, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   It was Rodriguez's first defeat in more than two months -- his
last loss came for triple-A Salt Lake, when he gave up five earned
runs on six hits in the ninth inning of an 8-7 loss to Tucson on Aug.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave up one run," Angel right fielder Tim Salmon said. "C'mon,
he's not going to get everyone out. It's not like he got shelled.
He'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rodriguez, 20, responded well to his first playoff
heartbreak, when he gave up a two-run home run to Alfonso Soriano in
the sixth inning of Game 2 of the American League division series, a
game the Angels won.</TE>
<TE>   And he rebounded quickly from a shaky AL championship series
appearance against Minnesota, when he allowed three inherited runners
to score in a Game 5 victory. Why should this be any different?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see this as a setback," Angel closer Troy Percival said.
"I don't see him being fazed at all."</TE>
<TE>   It was a major setback for the Angels, though.</TE>
<TE>   They let a 3-0 third-inning lead slip away, and their vaunted
offense, which some were comparing to some of the greatest teams in
postseason history, grounded to a halt -- Giants pitchers faced the
minimum 18 batters over the final six innings, as the Angels hit into
three double plays.</TE>
<TE>   After rocking Giant starter Kirk Rueter for seven hits in the
first three innings, the Angels managed only three singles from the
fourth inning on.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, instead of taking a commanding 3-1 series lead
into Game 5 tonight, the series is now tied, and the Angels must face
Giant ace Jason Schmidt, who limited the Angels to three runs and
nine hits in 5 2/3 innings of a 4-3 San Francisco victory in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have our ace going too," Percival said, alluding to Angel
left-hander Jarrod Washburn. "Any time you have your ace going, you
have to feel good knowing that if you get a few runs, you have a good
chance to win. I'll take my chances with Wash out there any time."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who struck out Jeff Kent and retired Barry Bonds on a
grounder to first in the seventh, insisted after the game that he
felt good, and pitching Coach Bud Black said Rodriguez felt fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel great, and my stuff was good, I just made a couple of
mistakes," Rodriguez said. "I got a couple of balls up in the zone,
and a couple of my breaking balls were hanging.... I'll just forget
it. It's in the past. I'll come back [today] and will be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez wasn't nearly as devastated as Molina, who took the
blame for the loss. With Snow on first base and none out in the
eighth, Rodriguez threw a fastball that cut outside at the last
second. The ball nicked off Molina's glove and to the backstop,
allowing Snow to take third.</TE>
<TE>   Molina also second-guessed his pitch selection on Bell's
game-winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why he'd say it was his fault we lost," Salmon said
of Molina. "If that's the case, it's my fault because I made an error
[in the fifth inning]. There's no reason for anyone on this club to
take responsibility like that. We pick each other up. Nobody is
looking at him as being the reason we lost."</TE>

<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at the age of 23, he won
the Cy Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11
shutouts and 15 complete games. He was also a 20-game winner with
Minnesota in 1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a
boxing promoter, is guest analyst for The Times for this World
Series.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   You look at a game like this with all those big hits and it comes
down to the ball that was bunted up the line in the fifth inning by
Kenny Lofton. If third baseman Troy Glaus had grabbed it a second
earlier, it could have been different.</LD>
<TE>   A play like Lofton's bunt single makes the difference. It puts two
runners on with no outs and the Giants score the three runs they need
to tie the score and break the Angels' momentum.</TE>
<TE>   But that's baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had been hitting so well you take it for granted. Until
a game like this.</TE>
<TE>   It reminds me of 1967. I was pitching for the Twins and we're in
Boston on the last day of the season, playing for the pennant. I had
them shut out entering the sixth inning. Then, even though they hit
only one ball out of the infield, they scored five runs to win the
game and the</TE>
<TE>   pennant.</TE>
<TE>   But that's baseball.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing Angel Manager Mike Scioscia could have done.
Well, I take that back. Here I go again second-guessing, but I would
have taken John Lackey out in the fifth inning. He was in trouble
from the beginning. He got out of jams a couple of times on double
plays, but then got right back into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Look, he had the 3-0 lead. He did his job. He got through four
innings and, the way he was pitching, that was a miracle. So in the
fifth, I send in the kid -- Francisco Rodriguez. That's my gambler's
instinct.</TE>
<TE>   I know they don't like him to pitch more than two innings, but
hey, he's a young man, he has a live arm. He could pitch almost every
day if he had to.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he gave up the winning run in the eighth, but you have to
believe he might have kept the Giants out of that big inning in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing about this kid. Don't worry about him coming back in
Game 5, Game 6 or Game 7. He's tough mentally and his team believes
in</TE>
<TE>   him.</TE>
<TE>   My first year in spring training, I had a game where I struggled.
Afterward, owner Gene Autry pulls me aside and tells me this story
about a big rodeo he was in in Houston. He came out on Champion for
his big moment, he told me, and the horse reared up and knocked him
off. Here was a big star trying to make this rookie feel better.</TE>
<TE>   That was Gene.</TE>
<TE>   And I can see that's the way these guys are with Francisco
Rodriguez.</TE>

<TE>   As I send my son off to bed after the seventh inning of yet
another late-starting World Series game, it suddenly hit me why so
many fans of the current era leave games early. While growing up they
never realized baseball games lasted longer than seven innings!</TE>

<TE>   The rally monkey is annoying. And what's worse is all the press
coverage devoted to the obnoxious little primate and his small human
imitator. But as annoying as the rally monkey is to me, to Giant fans
he's 10 times worse. And that makes it all worthwhile.</TE>

<TE>   I've just come across cutting-edge technology that can read the
mind of Barry Bonds. Here is a transcript of one of his World Series
at-bats:</TE>
<TE>   "OK, here I go again. Let's see what kind of junk this pitcher
has. I wonder how far I'll hit this one? Water ball? Hmmm. OK, I'm in
the batter's box now. Everyone's watching me, I'm Barry Bonds, the
greatest home run hitter there ever was. I'm in the World Series.
Here comes the pitch. Eye on the ball. (Crack!) Oh, I just hit
another one. I'll just flick my bat now and start walking to first
now. OK, over the wall, I think I'll start the ol' trot, the slower
the better, because, hey, I'm Barry Bonds. OK, I'm coming to home.
Let's see, is it step on the plate, then point to the sky? Or vice
versa? Anyway, back to the dugout. Oh great, my teammates want to
high-five me. Do I have to touch them? I mean, come on! I'm Barry
Bonds! I'll do it only because everyone's watching. Slap! Slap! Slap!
I'll walk away from them all now to my little corner of the dugout. I
hope they don't try to talk to me. I wonder if we're winning?"</TE>

<TE>   Normally, anyone who admires his home runs gets knocked down the
next time up. So if the Angels are going to give Barry Bonds a free
base, why not plunk him?</TE>
<TE>   As Don Drysdale said, "Why use four pitches to put someone on base
intentionally when I can do it with one?"</TE>

<TE>   You don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind,
you don't pull the mask of the Lone Ranger and (listen, Mike
Scioscia) you don't pitch to Barry Bonds with runners on base.</TE>
<TE>   Percy chucking one up there to see how far it goes, maybe. But
with the Giants down in their own park and you're stepping on their
neck, four wide ones to Bonds, please! Chicken dance or no. Put him
on and get the outs and the Series.</TE>

<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With apologies to the late, great Herb Caen, newspaper columnist and
Bay Area icon, Thomas Bonk reports on the scene in San Francisco with
the World Series in town.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   SAN FRANCISCO -- When the World Series is being played in the
city, there is one location that is the loneliest place on earth.
We're speaking, of course, about the Disney Store at Union Square.
Because Disney owns the Angels, shopping there this week must be
considered a serious offense. Consorting with the enemy. Perhaps that
is why there were so few people trolling the aisles, avoiding the
strollers, between the stuffed animals, all the while being assailed
with sound and video ads for "Beauty and the Beast."</LD>
<TE>   Giant fans will tell you that is precisely the matchup in this
World Series. Oddly, and thankfully, there are no stuffed rally
monkeys offered for sale at the Disney store. Predictably and
comfortably, there are plenty of lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my!</TE>
<TE>   In a display in the storefront window, a small, cardboard cutout
of a cable car is driven by a small, cardboard cutout of a creature.
We're not entirely sure, but it was either David Eckstein or Mickey.</TE>
<TE>   Just because Disney owns the team, does that necessarily mean that
Angel fans are more animated than others? ... To the very harmonic
sum of $25 million, the newly renovated Union Square shines like a
polished gem. At the center of Union Square is the Dewey Monument, a
90-foot Corinthian granite column that is completely covered by
scaffolding, probably so no crazed Disney/Angel fan captures it and
tries to make a ride out of it.... The street singer on the corner of
Powell and Geary wears a Giant cap as he confidently offers his
rendition of "Lean on Me." Songwriting credit, many believe, belongs
to Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   L'ban, doorman at the Sir Francis Drake, is attired in the hotel's
traditional red Beefeater uniform. For World Series week, he says he
would have preferred something orange and black. But L'ban has come
up with a solution. "I wear my Giant colors to the games," he
says.... Savvy shoppers, you art lovers. On Geary, one art store
advertises large numbers of prints by Marc Chagall. Is anyone else
amazed how Chagall continues to churn out prints, unhindered by the
fact that he died 17 years ago? ... Optometrist Kathleen Hum, who has
an office on Post Street, says she can just see the Giants winning
the Series. And as for the strength of Bonds' vision, Hum cannot be
mum on the subject. "I know his eyes have got to be pretty good to
follow the ball, as far as he hits it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The area of North Beach where Washington Square is located can be
confusing to visitors, possibly even more so to Angel fans, who are
more accustomed to the full color and precision of Disneyland maps.
Consider this your guide. It already has been pointed out that North
Beach really isn't a beach and Washington Square really isn't a
square and the statue in the middle isn't George Washington, but
Benjamin Franklin. Yes, it is terribly inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   The big church on the north side of the square is St. Peter and
Paul, where Joe DiMaggio married his first wife and where his funeral
was held. DiMaggio grew up in North Beach in a walk-up flat on Taylor
and first played baseball at North Beach Playground on Greenwich and
Powell, about a block from St. Peter and Paul. DiMaggio played for
the San Francisco Seals before making it with the New York Yankees.
He never played for the Giants.... Fior d'Italia, across the square,
bills itself as the nation's oldest Italian restaurant, opening May
1, 1886. It was a favorite hangout of former Dodger manager Tom
Lasorda, who reportedly was not in attendance on opening night.
However, some say that's how long they have been waiting for him to
pick up a check ... or the Angels to get into the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Moose is the owner of Moose's, which is a fortunate choice for
a name of a restaurant. He would not have had such an easy time if
his name were something else. Radioactive comes to mind. Moving on
now ... during the World Series, attempting to find a spot at the bar
at Moose's is as good a workout as you get on a treadmill. Moose says
the buzz about the Giants really picked up a week ago. "And now, I'm
excited too," he says. This is understandable. It's always exciting
for a proprietor of an establishment to watch his patrons squirm for
room amid a forest of Pilsener glasses, arms in the air and waving
credit cards as if they're trying to hail a taxi.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants do not know how lucky they are to have someone the
stature of Bud E. Luv as one of their biggest fans. Known as the
Fabulous Bud E. Luv, he not-so-shyly advertises himself as the
World's Greatest Entertainer, which is no small feat when you
consider he faces stiff competition from such heavyweights as Carrot
Top, Gallagher and Joe Cocker. Luv is a lounge singer and something
of a local legend who has written for the Giant team magazine and
served as a panelist judging the best hot dogs at Candlestick Park.
His new CD, "Diary of a Lounge Man," is his interpretation of the 15
greatest hits of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. Luv, who is quick
to point out that this number pales in comparison to the 613 greatest
hits of Bonds, dedicates his favorite song to each home run ball
Bonds socks. "Fly Me to the Moon," Luv says.</TE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high-powered Angel offense was supposed to slow down at Pacific
Bell Park because the ball doesn't carry as well as at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Some figured that would be a problem for the Angels, who have hit
a postseason record 22 home runs, but they don't rely on power.</LD>
<LD>   Contact hitting and sound baserunning provide the foundation of
the Angels' attack, and the Giants need to do more of that.</LD>
<TE>   "What they do well is put the bat on the ball and run the bases,
and the combinations amount to a lot of runs scored," said Giant
right fielder Reggie Sanders. "We've got to start doing the same
thing; not rely on waiting for the big hit. We've got to start
playing 'little ball' like they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said American League teams are usually associated with
homer-driven offenses, but the Angels play more like a National
League team.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a lot of tape on them, we knew what type of team they
are, and that's exactly how they've come out and played," he said.
"That's why we really have to bear down and do more of the little
things. We've got to do more of the things that they've been doing
against us."</TE>
<TE>   An NL club trying to keep pace with an AL club at little ball?
Talk about role reversal.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Sanders said. "It's a matter of taking the extra
base and trying not to let them take the extra base. We have to try
to put more pressure on them and stop them from putting so much
pressure on us.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to think about changing your game, you try not to
look at it that way. You just try to put the ball in play more and
let things happen. We need to try to create more things like they're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants did that Wednesday, winning without the long ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Dusty Baker downplayed the elbow stiffness of right-handed
closer Robb Nen, whom the Giants are reluctant to use for more than
an inning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time of the year when everybody has something," Baker
said. "It's not bothering him; we've just got to give him more time
to get loose."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt, who defeated the Angels in Game 1, said the Giants'
pitching staff is surprised by the Angels' success.</TE>
<TE>   "We underestimated them a little bit," said Schmidt, scheduled to
start tonight. "They're really not doing anything special, they're
just putting good wood on the ball and the balls are finding holes.
They're doing their job and we're not."</TE>
<TE>   -- Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's 10-4 loss to the Angels, a game preceded by Tony
Bennett's singing his signature "I Left My Heart in San Francisco,"
Giant equipment manager Mike Murphy decided to go to the singers'
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   As the last Giant drifted out of the clubhouse Tuesday night,
Murphy pulled out a photograph of Frank Sinatra, flanked by fellow
Rat Packers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., and stuck it on a
clubhouse wall.</TE>
<TE>   Explained Murphy, "We need a fighter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds' three walks Wednesday gave him 23 in the postseason,
yet another postseason record for the man who seems to set one every
night. He had been tied with Gary Sheffield, who walked 20 times in
the 1997 playoffs when he was a Florida Marlin. With all of Bonds'
walks Wednesday being intentional, he also has the postseason record
in that category with 11.</TE>

<HD>Giants' Faith in Rueter Rewarded</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With the Angels rolling and time running out in the World Series, the
San Francisco Giants leaned on their pitching staff Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Although they seemingly should have turned elsewhere for
inspiration, considering the group's ineffectiveness against the
Angels and what's at stake, the Giants stuck with the plan that got
them this far and hoped for another boost.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling staff provided one after a bumpy beginning
Wednesday night, shutting down the Angels after the third inning in a
4-3 victory in Game 4 at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone on the staff did their job tonight," said Tim Worrell,
who pitched a perfect eighth for the victory. "We know how good those
guys are and how big this game was for us, and we take a lot of pride
in coming up big for this team. We needed to get it done tonight and
we did."</TE>
<TE>   For a little while, it appeared they wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 42,703 watched the Angels jump to a 3-0 lead in the
third against left-hander Kirk Rueter, following a disturbing pattern
for the Giants and their fans. After all, Russ Ortiz and Livan
Hernandez were chased early during Games 2 and 3. But Rueter changed
course, holding the Angels scoreless in his final three innings,
setting up his teammates to do the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants tied the score with a three-run fifth against Angel
rookie right-hander John Lackey, and David Bell's run-scoring single
in the eighth was enough to win with the bullpen rejuvenated by
Rueter's timely effort.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Rodriguez was perfect in the seventh and Worrell followed
with a 1-2-3 eighth. Closer Robb Nen then finished the Angels,
getting pinch-hitter Brad Fullmer on a game-ending double play after
pinch-hitter Adam Kennedy singled with one out.</TE>
<TE>   Nen, who also had a save in Game 1, earned his seventh save in
nine postseason chances as the Giants evened the best-of-seven
series.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco turns to Game 1 winner Jason Schmidt tonight in Game
5, hoping to hold a 3-2 edge when the Series returns to Edison Field
for Game 6 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Everything turned around for the Giants because of the solid work
by the pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We just kept telling ourselves we had to find a way to win, and
we did that," catcher Benito Santiago said. "Now we've got our best
pitcher going. We're hoping to go to Anaheim up."</TE>
<TE>   Rueter helped make that a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   His overall pitching line (six innings, nine hits and three runs)
isn't impressive, but the nine-year veteran was strong after the
third. The Angels only had two singles against Rueter during that
span, and the Giants turned two double plays behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I got down, 3-0, I just told myself, 'I have to keep it right
here; give my guys a chance,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're an explosive team. They've proven that this series. They
can score in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Dusty Baker was thinking similarly.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't start thinking, 'Here we go again,' because it's going
to happen again," he said. "You have to start thinking, 'This it the
end of it. This is Kirk. That's all they're going to get.' And that's
all they got.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I say about Kirk other than we love having him on the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps our defense sharp. He throws strikes. Kirk did an
outstanding job. He gave us what we needed."</TE>
<TE>   The bullpen in particular.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants got only 5 1/3 innings combined from Ortiz and
Hernandez in Games 2 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say we were spent," Worrell said, "but let's just
say Kirk really gave us what we needed."</TE>
<TE>   All the Giant pitchers did.</TE>

<HD>Mets Land Howe; Piniella to Tampa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday; From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Foiled in their pursuit of Lou Piniella, the New York Mets quickly
switched course and have landed Oakland Athletic Manager Art Howe to
be their next manager.</LD>
<LD>   Howe and his agent, Alan Nero, met with the Mets in New York
Wednesday and agreed in principle on a four-year, $9.4-million deal,
Newsday learned.</LD>
<LD>   No official announcement will be made until after the World
Series, as ordered by Commissioner Bud Selig, but Howe and the Mets
put a surprise ending on a story full of twists and turns.</LD>
<TE>   Newsday also learned that Piniella has agreed to a four-year,
$13-million deal with his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Ken
Macha, Howe's bench coach in Oakland, has agreed to a multiyear deal
to replace Howe for close to $1 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Howe was made available twice by the A's, and the second time, the
Mets took advantage, luring the man who led the A's to three straight
playoff appearances but three first-round exits. Howe brings 12 years
of managerial experience and the reputation as a players' manager
with few confining rules. The low-key Howe also is seen as a person
at the opposite end of the spectrum from fired manager Bobby
Valentine, whom he will replace.</TE>
<TE>   Although Howe's bosses in Oakland viewed him as "too passive,"
according to executives around the leagues, Met people saw him as a
safe hire after failing to land Piniella, who had only one option
after his former team, the Seattle Mariners, struck a deal with only
one team, the Devil Rays, for his services.</TE>
<TE>   It was only last week that Oakland pulled Howe back from
consideration, knowing the Mets had locked their sights on Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Mets balking at Seattle's request of Roberto Alomar
and top shortstop prospect Jose Reyes for Piniella and high-priced
second baseman Bret Boone, Seattle made its deal with Tampa Bay,
reportedly for All-Star outfielder Randy Winn.</TE>
<TE>   From Newsday</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Kile, the St. Louis Cardinal pitcher who died of heart
disease in his Chicago hotel room June 22, will be on the 2003 Hall
of Fame ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Kile, who was 33, will become only the third player to appear on
the ballot before the customary five-year waiting period. Roberto
Clemente and Thurman Munson were the others.</TE>

postseason, failed to produce. They grounded into three double plays

why they scored only three runs.</LD>

<HD>They Make Walking Bonds No Free Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>They each drove in one run in a game decided by one, and maybe that's
enough of a promising indication for the San Francisco Giants that
the top and bottom half of the Barry Bonds' sandwich hasn't gone
totally stale.</LD>
<LD>   The situation in Game 4 of the World Series was that the Giants
needed to take a bite out of the Angels, needed to avoid going down,
3-1 in games, and they showed enough teeth to prevail, 4-3.</LD>
<LD>   The judicious Angels, of course, took the bat away from Bonds
again by walking him three times intentionally, but the struggling
Jeff Kent, batting ahead of him, and the comparably struggling Benito
Santiago, batting behind him, each drove in a run off John Lackey as
the Giants rallied from a 3-0 deficit to tie the score in the fifth
inning. David Bell ultimately drove in the decisive run in the eighth
after the San Francisco bullpen finally defused that volatile Anaheim
offense.</LD>
<TE>   As Manager Dusty Baker would acknowledge later, it becomes a
different game for the Giants, and an easier game, when Kent and
Santiago are producing, taking the pressure off Bonds and giving
opposing managers a bit of a reason, at least, to think twice about
walking Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The result in Game 4, assuring a Game 6 in Anaheim on Saturday
night, was especially sweet for Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   He had followed intentional walks to Bonds by grounding into
bases-loaded double plays in the first and third innings, and there
he was again in the fifth, with runners at first and second following
another intentional walk to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   This time, two for 15 in the Series with one run batted in at that
point, he lined a single to center that scored Rich Aurilia with the
run that tied the score, 3-3, as Bonds stood at second, applauding
Santiago as he stood on first.</TE>
<TE>   Even later, even after the Giants had salvaged the victory,
Santiago would say that he wasn't sure he deserved applause. This was
after he found his locker surrounded by reporters to the extent that
he had difficulty fighting his way through.</TE>
<TE>   "What's in there, what's in there?" the veteran catcher said
slyly. "If this is what hitting into double plays gets you, I don't
want to hit into double plays any more."</TE>
<TE>   He and the reporters laughed at that, but Santiago said he wasn't
laughing after grounding into the second double play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so disappointed," he said, "that I didn't even want to go
back to the dugout. Then I told myself, 'Don't think about it anymore
because you might have a chance to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Santiago didn't win it but at least tied it with his single in the
fifth, coming after he had released some of his frustration in the
underground batting cage. He called it "a small measure of
redemption," but he understands the pressure and reality of batting
behind Bonds, having done it for most of the second half of a season
in which he hit 16 home runs and drove in 74 runs at 37.</TE>
<TE>   "If I keep hitting into double plays, they're going to keep
walking Barry, that's just the way it is," Santiago said. "There's a
lot of pressure involved. It's not always easy."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, the battle-scarred catcher is familiar with tough
assignments. He has resurrected his career after a near fatal auto
accident and he has amended a lifestyle that threatened to end his
career with the same impact of that accident.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview room after the third one-run decision of the
Series, a reporter asked Baker if he had considered shaking up his
lineup, putting Aurilia or someone else behind Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever you put back there it's going to be the same situation,"
the manager said. "Benito's come through big-time in the second half.
That's why he remains there.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, if you [reporters] can come up with any better lineup,
please tell me."</TE>
<TE>   Since Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda are called on
only to deliver a ceremonial first pitch now and then, as they did
before Game 3 at Pacific Bell Park, this reporter sees Baker as not
having many lineup options except to keep Kent batting third and
Santiago fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Kent is three for 16 in the Series with two RBI. He struck out
with two runners on base in the first inning, lined out with two on
in the third, hit a fly ball to right with two on in the fifth that
scored Kenny Lofton from third with the second San Francisco run,
then struck out again against Francisco Rodriguez in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't worry about missed opportunities," he said later. "It's
frustrating in this situation because your tendency is to want to hit
every pitch out of the park, but you have to let the frustration and
the missed opportunities go. I mean, the game is bigger than me, the
team is bigger than me. It's all about 25 guys, it's all about the
pitchers doing their job, giving the offense time to keep creating
the opportunities. Benito had some, failed, then came through. I had
some, failed, then came through."</TE>
<TE>   Was it imperative that they did, that the Giants did?</TE>
<TE>   Kent refused to call it a must win, saying that none of his
teammates had lost confidence, but "I think we knew that we had to
save some face after [the 10-4 loss in Game 3], and I think we did
that. Everybody wants predictions on how this is going to play out,
but what you have is two very good teams going hard at each other and
it's a seven-game series. No one was thinking it would be over in
four or five."</TE>
<TE>   Predictions?</TE>
<TE>   Despite Baker's offer to come up with a better lineup, it can be
said with certainty that Kent and Santiago will be sandwiching Bonds
again tonight.</TE>

<LD>As he has throughout his career, Kirk Rueter continually pitched out
of trouble. The left-hander gave up nine hits in six innings and
retired the side in order once, but made the tough pitches when he
had to. That explains why a pitcher few give much thought to can have
the eighth-best career winning percentage among active pitchers.</LD>

<HD>Baseball's 10 Greatest Moments: Worthless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Thomson? Sorry, we've seen clips of his pennant-winning home
run and, really, what's the big deal? He hit it in black and white.</LD>
<LD>   Carlton Fisk? Uh-uh. His team lost that World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds? Doesn't smile as much as Mark McGwire.</LD>
<TE>   Jackie Robinson? Sure, his breaking of baseball's color barrier is
an achievement seared into the hearts and minds of an entire race.
But Cal Ripken Jr. made the front of a MasterCard credit card, and
when you're competing against the greatest legends of the game in an
election sponsored by MasterCard, what is the value of that?</TE>
<TE>   Priceless.</TE>
<TE>   On a September night in 1995, Ripken played in his 2,131st
consecutive game for the Baltimore Orioles, breaking Lou Gehrig's
record. He didn't clinch a pennant that night; the '95 Orioles
finished 71-73, 15 games out of first place. He didn't do anything
dramatic or spontaneous or unscripted; he simply punched the clock,
same as he had day after day, season after season.</TE>
<TE>   But he had the good fortune of doing it during the last decade, in
prime time, during the ESPN era, with the media hyping the moment for
months -- years, actually -- and whetting the appetite of a nation
gone sour on its erstwhile pastime in the wake of the 1994 players
strike.</TE>
<TE>   It was ultimate made-for-television, pre-packaged,
circle-the-calendar, feel-good event. Do you remember where you were
when Ripken broke the record? Of course you do. You had it in your
Day Planner months in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Did that give Ripken an edge in a summer-long poll, conducted
mostly online, to determine the most memorable moment in baseball
history? Of course it did. Ty Cobb didn't have his own Web site when
he played. Enos Slaughter never did a wink-and-nudge commercial with
the "SportsCenter" gang. In today's short-attention-span,
show-it-to-me-on-TV (again and again) culture, I'm amazed the rally
monkey didn't crack the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Ripken's 2,131st game was announced as the winner during an
on-field ceremony before Wednesday night's World Series Game 4. Out
of more than 1.1 million ballots cast, Ripken's record-breaker
received 282,821 votes, finishing ahead of Hank Aaron's 715th home
run, which received 275,451 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's 1947 big-league debut, which revolutionized American
society and finally dragged the major leagues into the 20th century,
was a modest third. Completing the top 10, in descending order, were
McGwire's 62nd home run in 1998, Gehrig's retirement speech in 1939,
Pete Rose's 4,192nd hit in 1985, Ted Williams batting .406 in 1941,
Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941, Kirk Gibson's World
Series home run in 1988 and Nolan Ryan's seventh no-hitter in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Half the top 10 happened during the VCR era.</TE>
<TE>   Six occurred during the color television era.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining four break down like this:</TE>
<TE>   Two involved famous New York Yankees. Gehrig -- that was the guy
who had the record before Ripken, right? DiMaggio -- didn't Paul
Simon write a song about him?</TE>
<TE>   One involved the lead character in this year's most publicized
sports soap opera -- Williams' frozen remains and his crazed
squabbling children.</TE>
<TE>   The other changed the course of U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants evened the World Series Wednesday night, but earlier
they drew the collar, going 0 for 5 on the greatest-moment poll.
Thirty moments were listed on the official ballot, and the Giants had
five:</TE>
<TE>   * Christy Mathewson pitching three shutouts in the 1905 World
Series;</TE>
<TE>   * Carl Hubbell striking out Babe Ruth, Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al
Simmons and Joe Cronin in succession in the 1934 All-Star Game;</TE>
<TE>   * Thomson hitting his 1951 pennant-winning home run;</TE>
<TE>   * Willie Mays making his legendary Polo Grounds catch in the 1954
World Series;</TE>
<TE>   * Bonds hitting his 71st home run in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   None of them made the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Look for the following advertisement in the days ahead: Visa, the
new official credit card of the San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   When McGwire, clad in business suit and St. Louis Cardinal cap,
jogged onto the field when his name was announced, the Pac Bell Park
crowd began chanting, "Barry! Barry!" Bonds broke McGwire's record,
an event that plays much better in San Francisco than Peoria. Bonds
does not appear in any commercial with a fan dreaming about being his
best friend.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest cheers were reserved for Rose, possibly because the
crowd knew Jim Gray wouldn't be there to interview him.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest jeers, no surprise, went to Gibson, an old Dodger
milking it in the middle of hostile territory, pumping his fist, the
same way he did as he rounded the bases in '88 against the A's.</TE>
<TE>   Between Robinson's debut and Gibson's home run -- a span of 41
years -- the Dodgers were not represented on the top-30 ballot. No
Sandy Koufax. No Maury Wills. No Don Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, no moments between 1961 and 1971 were listed at all,
meaning no Miracle Mets, no Bob Gibson striking out 17 Detroit Tigers
in a World Series game, no Curt Flood.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the top 30 -- 17 in all -- happened after 1970.
Nine occurred after 1990 -- three during the last 13 months. In
addition to Bonds' 71st home run, the ballot included Arizona's World
Series upset of the Yankees and Ichiro Suzuki sweeping the American
League MVP and rookie of the year awards. In other words, one of the
30 greatest moments in major-league history, according to the ballot,
was an off-season conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as strange as the ballot was the three-man rotation
selected to MC the pregame ceremony: Billy Crystal, presumably
because he made a movie about baseball; Ray Liotta, presumably
because he appeared as a player in a movie about baseball; and Andy
Garcia, presumably because he has a loud voice. But, then, the
organizers were working with a very short list. Whom else could they
have rounded up to host? Bud Selig?</TE>
<TE>   Ripken got many of his votes, no doubt, because he hauled Selig's
necktie out of the wringer in '95, by doing something that no major
leaguer did during September and October of '94. He played baseball.
Every day. Ripken helped bring back jaded fans who had sworn off the
game, and had sworn to keep their children away, only 12 months
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Selig remains in his debt.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, thanks to a credit-card company and its
over-hyped popularity contest, Ripken received partial payment.</TE>

<HD>Bell's an Angel on the Giants' Shoulder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>David Bell should be an Angel.</LD>
<LD>   He plays like an Angel. Whatever the Giants need, Bell does it.</LD>
<LD>   "From the time Dave came to the Giants," teammate Rich Aurilia
said, "he was the kind of guy who worked hard at everything and who
tried to fit in immediately. You could just tell that the guy wanted
to do things the right way and he always has."</LD>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel.</TE>
<TE>   He comes off the field with his uniform dirty and his hands
bruised and bloodied.</TE>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel.</TE>
<TE>   He's making $1.75 million this year, which might be a lot to you
and me but is small change to most major leaguers and the kind of
small change the Angels love to pay for productive players.</TE>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel.</TE>
<TE>   The way he goes after the game, hard and smart, with everything he
does for a purpose, with every move he makes for a reason, earned
Bell the 2002 Willie McCovey Award.</TE>
<TE>   This is important because the award is voted on by his teammates,
coaches and training staff and it goes to the player considered the
most inspirational. Bell, 30, is an eight-year veteran of the majors
but in his first season with the Giants. It's not easy for a new guy,
one who's not a star, who's the No. 8 hitter, who steps into a
clubhouse not known for its camaraderie and is chosen as the guy who
works the hardest and best and who earns the admiration of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's how Dave is," catcher Benito Santiago said. "He does
things the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel for then he wouldn't have beaten them
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Facing Francisco Rodriguez, the extraordinary 20-year-old Anaheim
relief pitcher, Bell did something no one had been able to do so far
in the postseason. Give Rodriguez a loss.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the eighth, in a game tied 3-3, in a World Series
the Giants trailed 2-1, on a 1-0 fastball, Bell singled to center.
J.T. Snow, who had led off the inning with a single and moved to
second on a passed ball, scored the winning run on Bell's well-hit,
well-placed single.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to get a pitch I could handle and hit it hard,"
Bell said. "He's had a lot of success so far. He's done a great job
for these guys. But for us, to get a win tonight was so important and
I think for us to get a run off him was important too."</TE>
<TE>   This made up for a sin of commission Bell had made earlier. With
his team already behind 3-0 and with the Series maybe slipping away,
Bell led off the sixth inning by cracking a sizzling line drive near
the left-field line off Ben Weber, who had just come in to relieve
starter John Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson zeroed in quickly on the ball and stopped it from
going to the wall. Bell knew he had hit a shot. "I never hit a ball
like that, that wasn't a double," Bell said. He thought this was a
double too and headed to second. But it was a single and Anderson
threw Bell out at second.</TE>
<TE>   "Garret did a great job of getting over and making a play," Bell
said. "I wish I would have stopped at first, but I'm glad we won the
game. Otherwise I would have thought that might have cost us."</TE>
<TE>   It is that way Bell has, of owning up to a mistake and making up
for the mistake by knocking in the winning run that has earned him so
much respect from teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "David came into spring training and we immediately saw what kind
of work ethic he had," Aurilia said. "He works hard. He goes down,
gives everything he has every day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a player who nobody really knows about in the National
League, but he's one of our MVPs this year. If you follow our team,
what he did tonight, it wouldn't surprise anybody. He's come up with
clutch hits all season."</TE>
<TE>   Bell joined the Giants this year after having been deemed
expendable by the Mariners. It's not as if Bell was the reason
Seattle won 116 games last year and didn't make the playoffs this
year, but he is the kind of player who is often not appreciated until
he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   So Bell should be an Angel because all he does is win. The
Mariners apparently missed Bell more than they missed Ken Griffey
Jr., or even Randy Johnson. Even in youth baseball, Bell won. His
Cincinnati 15- and 16-year-old teams won national Mickey Mantle and
Connie Mack titles and a year after that his Cincinnati Moeller high
school team won the state  title.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a surprise. Bell is the grandson of a major league
player (Gus) and the son of a major league player and manager
(Buddy). Both his younger brothers play in the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Buddy had been fired earlier this season by Colorado and has spent
significant time watching his son this year. Never in an obtrusive
way, though. Always in the background, in the cheap seats, far away
from being a bother or a point of focus.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad," Bell has said, "is my best friend."</TE>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel because he'll do anything. In 2000 for the
Mariners, he played 81 games at third, 40 at second and even one at
first. He's Scott Spiezio, a man with a family history in the game
and an appreciation for what being a teammate is.</TE>
<TE>   Even last night, as Bell was being asked if maybe he gave Buddy
grief because Buddy had never played in a World Series, Bell wouldn't
give the answer being requested, not even as a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was a great player," Bell said. "It's no reflection on
anything he did. It just shows how important being on a good team is
and a team with a legitimate chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Bell should be an Angel. He understands what's important. The
team. Nothing else.</TE>

<HD>Rose Enjoys the Cheers at a Memorable Moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Pete Rose called it a night for "goose bumps."</LD>
<LD>   On a chilly night at Pacific Bell Park before the fourth game of
the World Series, Pete Rose, who has received a cold shoulder from
baseball since he was banished for gambling, got a warm welcome from
both Commissioner Bud Selig and the fans.</LD>
<LD>   "He talked to me and was very cordial," said Rose, who was being
honored for breaking Ty Cobb's record of 4,191 hits in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Rose's feat was sixth among the top-10 moments in baseball history
as voted by 1.1 million fans in season-long balloting.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," Rose said of the huge ovation and chants of
"Hall of Fame" from the fans when he was introduced. "You never know
what to expect from the fans. I know I've got the fans in Cincinnati
on my side. But the reception I got here in San Francisco was so
rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "They understand I made a mistake. I understand I made a mistake.
Maybe baseball finally understands I made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who cannot be voted into the Hall of Fame unless baseball
reinstates him, has been kept at arm's length from league functions.
Although reporters requested his presence in the interview room at
Pac Bell Park Wednesday, baseball officials declined the request.</TE>
<TE>   Rose spoke with two reporters in the Angel dugout after the
ceremony but was escorted away before he could talk to dozens more
clamoring for a quote.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope baseball will let me get on with my life," Rose said.
"Anybody would have to say my name is synonymous with baseball. I'm
not going to badmouth baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Rose said Wednesday at Pac Bell was neither the time nor the place
to deal with his status in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   But asked about a player taking the field as he exited, Rose had
no hesitation about offering an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry Bonds," he said, "is one of the top five to ever play the
game."</TE>
<TE>   And then Rose disappeared into the crowd.</TE>

<HD>Ryan, True to His Word, Can't Make a Pitch</HD>
<DH>Family and business obligations keep Hall of Famer from a
ceremonial appearance at any Anaheim games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nolan Ryan says it's not animosity that has kept him from Anaheim.
It's his hectic schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan insists he's rooting strongly for his former team to win its
first World Series. He has watched every game, has shared several
postgame telephone chats with his equally excited children and wishes
he could attend games in person.</LD>
<LD>   But he can't. He made previous commitments.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled as can be for that team, and would've loved to be
out there, but the timing couldn't be worse," Ryan said in a
Wednesday telephone conversation from San Antonio. "I commit to
things way out and things always seem to pile up on me in October.
Last spring, it never crossed my mind that the Angels would be in the
World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, 55, said the conflicts forced him to decline the Angels'
invitation to throw out the first pitch of any division series or
league championship series games. He also told Major League Baseball
of his unavailability for Game 1 of the World Series in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said business and family interests, specifically a vacation
with his wife, Ruth, and a cattle breeders' convention, haven't
allowed him to "fly out and fly back without missing something."</TE>
<TE>   He denied that his absence was the result of any lingering
animosity toward the organization after a bitter parting in 1979,
when then-general manager Buzzie Bavasi let Ryan test the free-agent
market and sign the first $1-million annual contract with the Houston
Astros. Bavasi said later he could replace Ryan, 16-14 that year,
with two 8-7 pitchers. Ryan wears a Texas Ranger cap on his plaque at
the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said he was envious of those who've experienced the
excitement at Edison Field after hearing from "longtime friends who
have tickets."</TE>
<TE>   "He really wanted to do it," said Tim Mead, the Angel vice
president of communications who asked Ryan about the division and
league championship series first pitches. "He was always on our 'A'
list, and he was on the 'A' list of people we forwarded to MLB for
the World Series. But he keeps a hefty schedule."</TE>
<TE>   So what could have been an emotionally charged moment on an
unprecedented evening never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of taking his former spot on the Anaheim mound to fire a
ceremonial fastball before Game 1 of the World Series, Ryan, the best
pitcher in team history, the man who blazed his way to the Hall of
Fame with four of his seven no-hitters, five 300-plus strikeout
seasons and 138 wins in eight years as an Angel (1972-79), was home
in Texas on Saturday night, baby-sitting three of his grandchildren
with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan and Ruth had long ago promised their son, Reid, and his wife
that they'd watch the children -- ages 2 1/2 and 9 months -- while
the young couple celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary in San
Antonio. A day earlier, Nolan and Ruth returned home from a vacation
to Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad really wanted to be [in Anaheim] for that," Reid Ryan said.
"If I would've known the Angels were going to be in the World Series,
I never would have got married Oct. 19."</TE>
<TE>   Nolan asked his other son, Reese, and his wife to represent the
family. Reese, named after former Angel coach Jimmie Reese, left his
1 1/2-year-old daughter with Nolan and Ruth and watched Game 1 in a
private box also occupied by Jackie Autry, the wife of former team
owner Gene Autry. Jackie Autry participated in the first-pitch
ceremony that night with former Angel pitcher Chuck Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's retirement life has been active. He's an accomplished
rancher, raising cattle at three Texas ranches and serving as
president of the 7,000-member Beefmaster Breeders United. On
Saturday, one of his bulls was the highest-selling animal at a cattle
sale he attended with a grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan also owns the double-A Round Rock Express, a Texas League
team affiliated with the Astros. He's a spokesman for Advil and
Southwest Airlines. And he's going to open a new bank in Austin in
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad's got a lot of good friends in Anaheim, his most dominating
years were as an Angel, and I know his toughest decision in baseball
was saying no in 1989 to Gene Autry's offer to return to the Angels,"
Reid Ryan said. "Baseball also wanted him in San Francisco [on
Wednesday] for the top 10 moments event [honoring his record seventh
no-hitter]. He couldn't make that either. We've just laughed about
it. This is one of the neatest deals ever and it's like fate is not
allowing him to go."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have booked several former players, including Buck
Rodgers, Rod Carew and Brian Downing, to participate in first-pitch
ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's schedule is filled through Sunday because Beefmaster
Breeders United is conducting its annual convention in San Antonio.
He said there's no way he could make it to Anaheim in time for a
possible Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there could be some people saying, 'I can't believe he'd
miss the first pitch for a cattle sale,' but that's the exact thing
that makes him great," Reid Ryan said. "He treats everyone with equal
respect. His thing is that he committed to these other things first
and he's a man of his word."</TE>

<KH>GAME 4 AT PACIFIC BELL PARK SAN FRANCISCO 4, ANGELS 3</KH>
<HD>Angels Shaved by Bell</HD>
<DH>Giant third baseman gets clutch hit to beat Rodriguez and
even the Series/ Passed ball is key; Angels bats go cold after third
inning</DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>This is not a carnival game. This is not as automatic as throw hard,
knock down the milk bottles and win a prize.</LD>
<LD>   In the cruelest of ways, and at the most inopportune of times, the
Angels were reminded that the kid with golden arm cannot win a game
by himself. Francisco Rodriguez lost, a fate he did not deserve. The
Angels lost Game 4, and the World Series is now a best-of-three.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants nicked the Angels' wondrous rookie for an
unearned run in the eighth inning Wednesday. David Bell singled home
J.T. Snow with the winning run -- after a passed ball by catcher
Bengie Molina allowed Snow to move into scoring position -- and the
Giants tied the World Series at two games apiece with a 4-3 victory
over the Angels. The Series will return to Anaheim on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody cares about the first four games now," Angel infielder
Benji Gil said. "That's like asking somebody if they care about the
games in spring training. The first four games are completely
irrelevant now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the games are memorable, the Series compelling. On an
evening when baseball saluted its past, trotting out such legends as
Hank Aaron, Cal Ripken and Pete Rose in a pregame ceremony, the
dramatic crescendo occurred during the game, in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Now batting, Barry Bonds. Now pitching, Rodriguez. The sellout
crowd of 42,703 stood, anticipation flowing through the crowd like
electricity, flashbulbs popping from every direction to capture the
moment, the best slugger of this generation facing perhaps the best
reliever of the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had walked Bonds intentionally in each of his first
three at-bats. Rodriguez got him, on a ground ball.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, with the score tied, 3-3, the Angels were
optimistic. For the seventh and eighth innings, they had Rodriguez.
For the ninth, they had closer Troy Percival. If they threw up a run
of their own somewhere in there, they would win. They would lead the
Series, three games to one, and the Giants would be all but mortally
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "You might get a little spoiled by Francisco," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "He's been incredible. He's virtually gotten everybody
out."</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Rodriguez retired the side in order, and a
fearsome side it was--Jeff Kent, Bonds, Benito Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth inning figured to be the easier one. But Snow led off
with a single. On the next pitch, as Reggie Sanders squared to bunt,
Rodriguez threw a cut fastball that sailed outside. Sanders pulled
the bat back, but the ball caromed off Molina's glove. On the passed
ball, Snow took second base.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, trying to bunt, popped up. Bell then singled home Snow
with the winning run. And although Rodriguez said he took
responsibility for leaving a breaking ball up to Snow and leaving a
fastball up to Bell, Molina took responsibility for the defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a couple of pitches cost us the game," Molina said.
"The passed ball I had cost us the game."</TE>
<TE>   After the final out, Rodriguez sat in the dugout, alone with his
thoughts and the first loss of his brief major league career. He had
pitched in eight playoff games this season, and the Angels had won
them all.</TE>
<TE>   With a little help from his friends, he would still have yet to
give up a run in the majors. In five appearances in September, he did
not give up a run. In the playoffs, he has given up three runs--the
unearned run Wednesday, and a two-run home run to the Yankees'
Alfonso Soriano, who would not have batted had Gil not botched a
double play in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   So, asked what he might say to Rodriguez today, Angel pitching
coach Bud Black scoffed at the question.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to say hi," Black said. "Hey, nobody is invincible."</TE>
<TE>   And, on a night the Angel bats took the last six innings off,
first baseman Scott Spiezio said the responsibility for defeat should
not be shouldered solely by Molina, or by Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "For those guys to take it on their shoulders is crazy," Spiezio
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels jumped on San Francisco starter Kirk Rueter for three
runs and seven hits in the first three innings. They got a sacrifice
fly from David Eckstein in the second inning and a two-run homer from
Troy Glaus in the third.</TE>
<TE>   The home run was the seventh for Glaus in the playoffs, tying
Bonds for the record in a postseason.</TE>
<TE>   However, over the final six innings, the Angels sent the minimum
18 batters to the plate. Garret Anderson singled in the fifth inning,
but Glaus hit into a double play. Spiezio singled in the sixth, but
Molina hit into a double play. Adam Kennedy singled in the ninth
against Giant closer Robb Nen, but Brad Fullmer grounded into a
game-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Some day, John Lackey will be able to tell his children that he
started a World Series game on his birthday, and that he singled in
his first major league at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   He will not, however, be able to tell them that he earned the
victory. Lackey, who turned 24 Wednesday, pitched four shutout
innings before giving up three runs in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The team that loses tonight will have no losses to spare. The
Angels turn to ace Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure's on," Washburn said. "The game is huge. I want to
be that guy. Everything is riding on my performance."</TE>

<HD>Series Is Largely a Local Favorite</HD>
<DH>The Angel-Giant matchup is posting impressive ratings in
California but not so nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no question that the Southland has been captivated by the
Angels and their World Series run. Their 10-4 victory over the San
Francisco Giants in Game 3 Tuesday night got a 32.3 rating with a 48
share of the audience in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   And in San Francisco, Game 3 drew a 32.0 rating with a 49 share.
It marked the first time in the Series that L.A. got a better rating
than San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   But while the Series is a hit in California, it is not faring as
well in other areas of the country, particularly the East. And
because of that it appears to be on the way to becoming the
lowest-rated Series ever.</LD>
<TE>   The national rating for Game 3 was a 10.8 with an 18 share, and
the three-game average was a 10.8/19.</TE>
<TE>   The previous low for a Series was a 12.4/21 for the "Subway
Series" in 2000 between the New York Yankees and Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Game 3's numbers were 30% below the 15.4/24 for Game 3 of last
year's Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Yankees. And the
three-game average is off 22% from last year's 13.8/22.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Goren, Fox Sports president, was not surprised by the drop-off.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to the regional matchup dampening overall
viewership," he said, "Game 3 in particular was negatively influenced
by the Angels' taking an early 8-1 lead."</TE>
<TE>   The national rating peaked at a 13.0 from 6:30-7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Also," Goren said, "Game 3 last year had a big boost by an
emotional first game at Yankee Stadium, highlighted by President Bush
throwing out the ceremonial first pitch and capped by a close 2-1
score.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is Games 1 and 2 were two of the top-13 shows in
prime time last week, and Fox finished first each night a World
Series game was played."</TE>
<TE>   Goren also has to be heartened by the Game 3 ratings in L.A.,
which are Laker-type numbers. The four-game NBA Finals in June
averaged a 31.8 rating with a 51 share. The year before, when the
Lakers beat the Philadelphia 76ers in five games, the NBA Finals
averaged a 33.2/54.</TE>
<TE>   But the declining Series ratings are a concern. In general,
television ratings are declining because of the proliferation of
cable channels and Internet activity. No Series has averaged a 20
rating since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The highest-rated Series was in 1978 between the Dodgers and
Yankees, which averaged a 32.8/56. Last year's dramatic seven-game
Series drew a 15.7/25.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that might help ratings is speeding up the games. The
first two games of this Series averaged 3 hours 50 minutes. Game 3
went 3:37 and didn't end until after midnight in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "They lost me in the sixth inning," said New Yorker Neal Pilson,
the former president of CBS Sports, which carried the World Series
from 1990 to '93. "I usually start nodding off at 11 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Pilson, now a leading sports television consultant, said not much
can be done about starting the television coverage any earlier. The
networks want prime-time coverage to reach the largest audiences. And
there are obligations to affiliates for time slots for local news and
local programming.</TE>
<TE>   "You really can't start the coverage before 8 p.m. [in the East].
But one thing you can do is cut back on the pregame," Pilson said.
"It's foolish to not start the game within five minutes of going on
the air."</TE>
<TE>   Of course there are viewers who like to see the introduction of
players and other pregame festivities. Fox has been criticized for
not providing more of that.</TE>
<TE>   You can't please everyone. The late finishes bother people in the
East, and the 5:30 p.m. start times don't sit too well with fans in
the West. A lot of people are stuck on the freeways at that time, or
busy with other activities.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Turns On the Charm, but This Guy Is Not Fooled</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, and Barry Bonds, the most compelling player
in baseball and the game's biggest jerk if you believe Kevin Brown is
washed up, is surrounded by Angels, and deserted by his own
teammates.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants have concluded batting practice, and it's time for the
Angels to take their hacks before the fourth game of the World
Series, but Bonds is locked in an animated conversation with an
attractive woman who works for the Major League Baseball Players
Assn. next to the batting cage, and he's not moving.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon is swinging a bat over his head to loosen up, and if he
backs up two feet, he'll club Bonds and the Giants will be forced to
forfeit. The Angels have been hitting everything, but Salmon misses
Bonds.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BONDS COULDN'T be any more out of place, but he's talking so much
he appears oblivious to his surroundings. He has a leather recliner
waiting for him in the Giants' clubhouse, but for the next 33 minutes
he stands there shifting from foot to foot in the middle of the
Angels' batting practice, and I know how much my lower back and legs
hurt standing in place and there's no way I could a hit a home run
after such wear and tear. (Now is the time to add your own punch
line.)</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he knows the Angels are going to walk him all night, which
explains why he is coming across now like Jay Leno giving his
monologue. He's swinging a bat for the woman, because he won't get
much chance to do it in the game, and if I was a woman and the best
home run hitter on Earth was swinging a bat just for me, I might
laugh at all his jokes too. (I'd swing a bat for the wife, but she'd
call the police.)</TE>
<TE>   Bonds and the woman are standing there in front of a hundred
cameras aimed their way, and they look as if they couldn't care less.
They appear to be on a first date, and if I'm wrong, I apologize, but
I can't be wrong, because that's how it appears. Bonds seems to be
flirting, doing everything he can to entertain the woman, and doesn't
stop for a second -- even when the third wheel shows up.</TE>
<TE>   Former player and current Bonds groupie Bobby Bonilla makes it a
three-way conversation, although Bonds never once makes eye contact
with Bonilla, and never once does Bonilla get the clue to get lost.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who ordinarily gives off the aura he doesn't like human
beings, which include reporters despite what Brown might say, is
laughing, joking, crinkling his nose, winking and carrying on the way
you might if given 33 minutes to impress Mimi Rogers. (That's 16
minutes more than I got, and I've never heard from her again; think
what I could have done with the full 33 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   It's a very revealing scene. Bonds is flashing a charming
personality, so he actually has one, which makes him even a bigger
jerk for going out of his way to act so unlikable. I make a note to
invite the attractive woman with me every time I have to interview
Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The batting cage get-together over, Bonds spots me standing next
to Fox's Suzy Shuster. He comes over for a hug and a kiss on the
cheek.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a good hug," Shuster says after breaking from his arms.</TE>
<TE>   I don't even get a hello. At least I know what it feels like to be
Bonilla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M JUST curious, does it make a difference to you if your
mega-superstars are also big jerks? I know how Dodger and Angel fans
feel about Bonds, because they have the ability to e-mail, and they
even nitpick.</TE>
<TE>   "How come nobody picked up on Big Baby Barry Bonds being the only
Giant player [in pregame introductions] to snub the nonstarters and
staff by not going down the line like Dusty Baker and every other
Giant starter?" wrote D.R. "You can tell from Big Baby's smug
attitude he doesn't care if the Giants win or lose."</TE>
<TE>   Or, from Cindy, "Is there a rule in baseball against saying
anything negative about Barry? Or am I the only one who thinks he
takes a self-admiring pose after he hits a home run.... Isn't that
poor sportsmanship?"</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers were good enough to be here, we know what their
fans would've been chanting from the left-field pavilion. But what
about sports fans elsewhere who don't have a vested interest in who
wins this California contest? Does it take anything away from Bonds'
place in super-athlete history that, if given the chance, he'd tell
you where to go?</TE>
<TE>   The image makers did a good job last year of softening the rough
edges, placing his young child in his arms during his home run march,
a la Allen Iverson during the NBA Finals against the Lakers. TV also
brings the best out of the very worst with reporters sucking up to
Bonds with softball questions to make sure he'll talk to them again.</TE>
<TE>   But send the kid to bed, turn off the TV lights, and Bonds is
going to go out of his way to make sure you know just how little he
thinks of you, and your place in his world.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, of course, I can't wait to see how far he can hit a
baseball, which is everything that is so wonderful about sports. It's
also the great turnoff, which in this case will make it more
satisfying if the Angels emerge the winners, and Bonds the big loser.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TED WILLIAMS received recognition for providing the seventh-most
memorable moment in baseball history before the game, and it's
probably not good news if we hear today he cracked a smile.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from</TE>
<TE>   Ellen S.:</TE>
<TE>   "You make me so mad.... I hope your wife never shuts up."</TE>
<TE>   No need to worry.</TE>

Washburn lost in the Giants' 4-3 victory. Washburn gave up home runs
to Barry Bonds, Reggie Sanders and J.T. Snow, the second time in four
playoff starts that he has given up three home runs. In his 32 starts
during the regular season, he never gave up three home runs.</TE>

<LD>Some moments in World Series Game 4 history:</LD>
<LD>   1914--The Boston Braves completed a sweep of the Philadelphia A's,
first in Series history, with a 3-1 victory.</LD>
<LD>   1941 -- After relief pitcher Hugh Casey retired the first two
Yankees in the ninth, the Dodgers were one out away from evening the
Series at two games apiece. Casey then struck out Tommy Henrich ...
but the ball got by catcher Mickey Owen (who was charged with a
passed ball), and Henrich scampered to first base. That opened the
floodgates, as Charlie Keller and Joe Gordon hit two-run doubles,
propelling the Yankees to an improbable 7-4 victory.</LD>
<TE>   1963 -- The Dodgers complete a four-game sweep of the Yankees as
Sandy Koufax outduels Whitey Ford, 2-1, at Dodger Stadium. It was the
first time the Yankees had been swept.</TE>
<TE>   1976 -- The Cincinnati Reds won the Series in four games with a
7-2 victory over the New York Yankees. Johnny Bench had two home runs
for five RBIs. It was the Reds' second consecutive championship and
marked the first time a team had swept the playoffs and World Series.</TE>
<TE>   1986 -- Gary Carter's two home runs at Fenway Park gave New York a
6-2 victory and pulled the Mets even with Boston Red Sox in the
Series.</TE>
<TE>   1990 -- The Cincinnati Reds completed one of the biggest upsets in
baseball history, beating the Oakland A's, 2-1, to sweep the Series.</TE>
<TE>   1993 -- Devon White's two-run triple capped a six-run eighth
inning as the Toronto Blue Jays rallied for a 15-14 victory over the
Phillies and a 3-1 Series lead. The 29 runs shattered the Series
record of 22 set in Game 2 in 1936, when the Yankees beat the New
York Giants, 18-4. It was also the longest nine-inning game in Series
history -- 4 hours 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   1998 -- The New York Yankees closed out their historic season with
3-0 victory at San Diego, sweeping the Padres. The Game 4 victory
gave the Yankees 125 wins against 50 losses -- for a .714 winning
percentage, the best in the majors since their Murderers' Row club of
1927. Their AL-record 114 regular-season victories were the most for
a champion.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>McCovey Cove is more than just a place for kayakers to dive for home
run balls. It is a good place for TV cameras to turn if a Giant game
gets boring.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what Giant President Peter Magowan said.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes when you have a blowout or a game where people's
attention wanders, you can show the Cove," he said. "I remember one
game, where things were a little out of hand and somebody in the Cove
hooked a halibut. It was a great shot."</LD>
<TE>   Instead of the rally monkey, maybe Giant fans can get behind the
hooked halibut.</TE>
<TE>   Magowan also continued his crusade for quicker games. His rant
focused on the fact that, as he said, "What do you tell a father who
takes his son to the baseball game and after two and a half hours,
only four innings have been played?"</TE>
<TE>   After singling out Angel pitchers Ramon Ortiz and Kevin Appier as
slow workers who dallied too long between pitchers, Magowan admitted
that "our guy last night" also was culpable. Livan Hernandez was
taking upward of 60 seconds between pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the commissioner is taking this very seriously,"
Magowan said. "Something needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   --Diane Pucin</TE>

<TE>   MY TWO SONS: Shortly after the Angels lost to the Boston Red Sox
in the 1986 American League championship series, which they were one
strike away from winning until Dave Henderson's devastating Game 5
homer off Donnie Moore, Angel owner Gene Autry took general manager
Mike Port and manager Gene Mauch out to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation that night, as Port, the current interim Red Sox
GM, told Boston Globe baseball writer Gordon Edes this week, went
like this:</TE>
<TE>   Autry: "You know how important it is that we're a family, that we
have camaraderie, and I love you two guys like my sons. Next year, I
want you to do everything you can to win it all."</TE>
<TE>   Mauch: "Well, Mr. Autry, that's great, and I appreciate that, but
a lot of things can happen over the course of a season -- you can
have injuries, slumps, some guys might not perform as well as you
expect. What happens if we don't win it all? Will you still love us
like sons?"</TE>
<TE>   Autry: "Yes ... but I'll miss you."</TE>
<TE>   --Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT-SO-FOND MEMORIES: It may be the Giants against the Angels, but
ultimately, the older, deeper, far more bitter Giant-Dodger rivalry
always seems to surface, even in the midst of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   When Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit home run in Game 1 of the 1988 Series
was voted baseball's ninth-most memorable moment in a credit-card
promotion, the fans booed loud and long while chanting the familiar,
"Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S A CELEBRATION: Odd enough that the Angels' John Lackey was
the starting pitcher Wednesday on his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Odder still, he is the second pitcher from a Southern California
major league team to start a World Series Game 4 on his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Dodger Tim Belcher beat the Oakland Athletics in Game 4
on his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANOTHER FIRST: Renal Brooks-Moon of the Giants, only female
African American public address announcer in the major leagues,
became the first woman to serve as a public-address announcer in the
World Series.</TE>

<LD>Halloween, our famous night of fright, is just around the corner.
Most likely you are thinking about Halloween costumes,
trick-or-treating and carving pumpkins. Pumpkins are a big part of
Halloween. Although most famous as happy or scary jack-o'-lanterns,
they are also an important food that is good for you.</LD>
<LD>   Pumpkins are members of the squash family and grow on vines. The
pulp inside pumpkins is used to make pumpkin pies, bread or even ice
cream, while the seeds can be roasted and eaten as a nourishing
snack.</LD>
<LD>   Pumpkins come in all sizes, so picking one that's just right to
decorate is always fun. Some of the largest pumpkins in the world
weigh more than 1,000 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   Imagine how long it would take to carve and decorate a pumpkin
that large!</TE>
<TE>   There are many creative ways to decorate pumpkins without carving
them. One fun and interesting way is to make faces using natural
plant material that you find on the ground. Use berries, acorns, pine
cones, seedpods, sticks, bark, feathers, leaves, fallen flower
petals, moss or other plant matter that you find to create
"spooktacular" eyes, noses, mouths, ears, eyebrows, eyelashes and
hair. Glue and stickpins will help hold everything in place.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, from 10 to 11:30 a.m., children 3 to 8 can learn to
decorate pumpkins naturally at a pumpkin decorating event at the
Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia. Reservations are
necessary; please call (626) 821-4624. And be sure to wear your
Halloween costume for the Peacock Parade! For more information on
children's programs at the arboretum, visit www.arboretum.org.</TE>

County, 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia.</TE>

<DH>The story so far: Sabina's volunteer project has begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gloria D. Miklowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"They're cool!" Sabina exclaimed when the two art students brought in
10 identical posters. She held one up so everyone could see. "You're
real artists!"</LD>
<LD>   In bright red letters the top of each poster read "1 + 1 = 2."
Under that was a short statement telling what those numbers meant,
and in the center was a picture of a small child reading a book.</LD>
<LD>   "Ms. Fishgold helped us," the boy said. "It was fun."</LD>
<TE>   "Paul and I thought we should tack them up right near the school
entrance and in front of every water fountain," Matt said. "What do
you think?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds great." Sabina smiled. "And we'll need boxes or barrels or
something to hold the books."</TE>
<TE>   "We can ask at the supermarkets for boxes," Rachel suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go with you," one of the committee members offered.</TE>
<TE>   "And maybe the custodian has some extra barrels."</TE>
<TE>   "As leader of this drive," Paul said, "I think you should announce
the start of the book drive on the school intercom tomorrow, Sabina.
How about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Sabina felt her face heat up and looked away.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw, she's blushing." Paul tossed a wad of paper at her.</TE>
<TE>   That night Sabina went through her own old picture books. Some,
like "Stellaluna," she loved a lot. Her father used to read it to her
when she was younger, just before bedtime. It would be hard to give
that book away. Or what about the wonderfully scary "The Ghost of
Nicholas Greebe"? She loved books. They gave her so much to think
about. Still, she selected five books she had read again and again,
books she hoped some other child would love as she did. Tomorrow she
would bring them to school.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: Will other children do the same?</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>
