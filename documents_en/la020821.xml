<LD>General Motors keeps giving sneak peeks at concepts rolling out of
its studios, and the peeks are coming earlier as GM tries to boost
excitement for its lineup.</LD>
<LD>   GM is celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding by stylist
Harley Earl of the GM Art and Colour Section, now simply GM Design.
It unveiled sketches last week at a product seminar in Santa Barbara
of the four concept cars it will show at Detroit's North American
International Auto Show in January.</LD>
<LD>   Though auto makers won't say early on if their concepts will make
it to production, GM has been batting about .500 in recent years. For
the 2003 show, Chevrolet gets two concepts--a Super Sport sedan and a
full-size pickup truck aimed at younger buyers--while Pontiac and
Buick get one each.</LD>
<TE>   GM calls the SS "a modern interpretation of Chevy's Super Sport
heritage." It's a four-door family sedan tuned to perform like a
sports car, with rear-wheel drive, a small-block 5.8-liter V-8
engine, high-performance suspension and brakes, and 20-inch wheels.
It has big, curvaceous front fenders, and the center console snakes
up onto the dashboard. It sports paddle shifters on the steering
wheel for changing gears.</TE>
<TE>   The Chevy Cheyenne is a full-size pickup truck with lots of hidden
storage space under the floor and in the pickup bed's sidewalls. It
has dual sunroofs and a tailgate that folds down or swings open like
a door.</TE>
<TE>   The swept-back look of the Cheyenne's cab is reminiscent of the
Alpha-T pickup Nissan showed a couple of years ago--a concept on
which Nissan's upcoming production pickup is based.</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac's new concept takes the brand's recently adopted "edgy"
direction forward (think Vibe and the coming GTO and this year's
Solstice concept--widely expected to get production go-ahead).</TE>
<TE>   The G6 concept for '03 is an agile two-door, four-passenger sports
sedan with a five-speed manual transmission, supercharged V-6 engine
and all-wheel drive.</TE>
<TE>   For Buick, which GM promises that "the spirit is back," the
Centurion concept indicates where the brand is heading with a
promised new crossover blending aspects of car and SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Buick needs new spirit, as it had muddled along until GM gave it
two trucks recently, the Rendezvous minivan-sport utility blend and
the Rainier SUV.</TE>
<TE>   The Centurion concept is a family hauler with three rows of seats
and sporty touches to soften the "family" edge.</TE>

<HD>Honda, Toyota Hybrids: How the Two Stack Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's new law that will require auto makers to drastically
reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by their cars could be a big
boost for so-called hybrid vehicles, which have fewer emissions and
better fuel economy than almost anything on the road.</LD>
<LD>   Other incentives include federal and state tax credits and grants
for hybrid owners. Virginia and Arizona even allow hybrids with one
passenger to use the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on freeways.</LD>
<LD>   There's not much choice yet, but most major car makers are
planning to offer a hybrid or two within the next few years.</LD>
<TE>   They will be hybrid-electric vehicles, combining internal
combustion engines and electric motors to achieve their fuel economy
and emissions magic.</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, only Toyota and Honda have brought hybrids to the
consumer market, and it is only this year that Honda, with its hybrid
Civic, matched Toyota's Prius with a five-passenger sedan that can
reasonably be used as regular family transportation. Honda's initial
offering was the Insight, a futuristic two-seater that has a fairly
limited audience.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the two "family" hybrids around Los Angeles recently, I
found lots of similarities in terms of size, performance, comfort and
price. But subtle differences separate them and will appeal to, or
turn off, prospective buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic five-speed manual starts at $19,550 and is rated at 51
miles per gallon on the highway, while the automatic with
continuously variable transmission (47 mpg) starts at $20,550. (The
CVT is essentially one gear with an infinite number of ratios, so
passengers never feel a shift from one gear to another.)</TE>
<TE>   Power in the Civic comes from a 1.3-liter, four-cylinder internal
combustion engine, assisted by a 10-kilowatt electric motor. Together
they generate 93 horsepower and a maximum 116 foot-pounds of torque.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic's engine shuts down three of the four cylinders when
decelerating, reducing friction and allowing recovery of more energy.
When the car comes to a stop the gasoline engine shuts off
automatically, then restarts when the driver releases brake pressure
or puts the car into gear.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's system uses the gasoline engine all of the time, with the
electric motor coming on to provide extra power, like a supercharger,
for acceleration, hill climbing and the like.</TE>
<TE>   When the car is coasting or braking, the electric motors in both
the Civic and the Prius act as generators to recharge the batteries.
Neither car uses external charging.</TE>
<TE>   The Prius, which first appeared two years ago and starts at
$20,480, has a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder gas engine wedded to a
33-kilowatt electric motor. Combined output is 98 horsepower and a
maximum 82 foot-pounds of torque.</TE>
<TE>   It is rated at 45 mpg on the highway, but gets 52 mpg in city
driving because of the way the electric motor takes over for the gas
engine at slow speeds.</TE>
<TE>   The Prius is available only with a CVT automatic transmission.
When it is stopped, the Prius' gasoline engine cuts off. Then the
electric motor silently kicks on to provide initial acceleration when
the accelerator is pressed. The Prius also runs on electric-only at
very low speeds, as when creeping along in rush-hour freeway traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Both cars win high marks from environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the difference between the two?</TE>
<TE>   Well, on the green side, the Prius scores better in California,
with a SULEV rating (super ultra-low emissions vehicle), while the
Civic, with its bigger gasoline engine, must make do with ULEV
status.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic's ride is smooth and quiet. The hybrid system is
seamlessly integrated--there is no sensation that the car has, in
effect, had a heart transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Outside and in, it looks like a conventional Civic. No special
aerodynamics, and certainly no plug outlet. The only unique trim is
the hybrid badge on the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   The Honda with CVT was a bit sluggish during initial acceleration
or when passing on the freeway, compared with the Prius. But it
reaches 80 mph smoothly with no sense of straining at that speed. The
manual transmission Civic hybrid feels a lot more powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the Civic's dashboard has three appealing light-blue
gauges that are always lighted. Nothing out of the ordinary, though
the dial on the far right has an area showing the charge in the
battery.</TE>
<TE>   There's a driver's-side armrest, always a nice touch, and covered
cup holders in the front console.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic's center console is minimal compared with the Toyota's,
but the trunk is larger, in fact quite spacious.</TE>
<TE>   For those who like to hang on, the Prius has three grab handles;
Honda adds one for the driver.</TE>
<TE>   In a squeeze, the Civic could fit five people inside; there are
three sets of seat belts in back. But there's minuscule legroom
unless the front seats are completely forward. There are no armrests
or cup holders in the rear.</TE>
<TE>   Neither car has overhead consoles for sunglasses or garage door
openers. Both have height-adjustable shoulder belts.</TE>
<TE>   The Prius has a bit of a spaceship-like look that will appeal to
some (ask my father) and turn off others (ask my mother).</TE>
<TE>   The main difference in propulsion is that the Prius starts in
electric mode, silently gliding along like a golf cart until you
reach a speed of 11 to 20 mph--when the gas engine kicks in depends
on the driver's style, with more aggressive accelerating getting
gasoline power faster. Some drivers will find this electric-only mode
very cool.</TE>
<TE>   There's a somewhat annoying vertical shifter mounted on the
dashboard that pulls toward the driver, blocking the view of some of
the audio controls.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota's CVT felt slightly rougher than the Honda's, but
acceleration was smoother. The Prius also reached high speeds without
noticeable flat spots in the acceleration curve. Neither of these
little cars, though, has much muscle.</TE>
<TE>   The Prius' most notable interior feature is that all the gauges
are in the center of the dashboard. At the driver's selection, a
large center screen displays either the audio controls or a diagram
of the powertrain, indicating whether the electric motor, gas engine
or both are powering the car. If the optional navigation system is
ordered, it is the default display.</TE>
<TE>   Below the screen is a digital clock and a cassette player; a CD
player is hidden behind a lid. There is a large center console
storage bin, but alas, no driver's armrest. There are no rear
armrests either, but there is a pair of cup holders down by the
passengers' feet.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Civic, there's fairly good rear seat room even when the
front seats are all the way back.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line? With similar performance it comes down to looks
and accouterments.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to be invisible while you do your part for the
environment, and care about having a driver's grab handle and
armrest, the Civic is the choice.</TE>
<TE>   If you want individuality, the Prius looks a little more
futuristic inside and out, and although that oddball shifter can be
irksome, the Prius is kinder to grown-ups in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, you'll be doing your share to save fuel and help clear
the skies.</TE>

<HD>Coupes Without B Pillars --Again</HD>
<DH>Mercedes-Benz is bringing back the wide-open effect that
used to define the vehicle and is calling the move revolutionary</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proving once again that there is little new under the sun,
Mercedes-Benz is hailing itself as an engineering genius for
developing a new coupe, the just-released CLK with no B pillar.</LD>
<LD>   That's the pillar that typically divides the front and rear side
windows and supports the vehicle's roof. It also causes a blind spot
of varying dimensions, depending on the car, for the driver and
interferes with the wide-open feeling that should be part of a coupe.
(A vehicle's pillars, or roof supports, are alphabetically listed
starting at the windshield, or A, pillar.)</LD>
<LD>   Mercedes says that because all four side windows of the CLK coupes
(there's a CLK320 with V-6 power, starting at $44,565, and a CLK500
with a V-8 engine, starting at $52,865) retract fully without a B
pillar to interfere, you get that "open, airy feel that conventional
coupes cannot match."</LD>
<TE>   It used to be that the absence of a center, or B, pillar defined
the coupe, and American car makers set the standard (think 1955 Chevy
Bel Air coupe, 1963 Lincoln Continental, 1965 Mustang, 1972 Pontiac
GTO, and the list goes on).</TE>
<TE>   But that was when the government did not require car makers to
meet roof crush standards--imposed in the early 1980s to help protect
occupants in the event of a rollover. With the standards came the
need to stiffen and strengthen roofs, and the wide-open "pillar-less"
coupe gave way to the modern hardtop coupe, with a solid pillar,
often hidden behind a blacked-out section of the rear side window.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes had best sing its praises about its coupe coup quickly,
though, because others are not far behind. Advances in engineering
and metallurgy make it possible to design cars that can meet all the
crash and crush standards without center pillars, and there are a
number on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most notable: Mazda's upcoming RX-8, a four-door coupe
with no B pillar; and Honda's Element, a boxy, four-door vehicle with
doors that swing out like barn doors to create a gaping, pillar-less
opening for loading bicycles, beer kegs, dorm furnishings or anything
the target 20-to-30-year-old male buyer can stuff inside.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac's upcoming XLR coupe, which debuted over the weekend at
Pebble Beach, also is B pillar-less.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some might argue that Mercedes is singing a little out of
tune: GM's Saturn unit introduced a three-door coupe in the 2001
model year that had a B pillar on the passenger side but none on the
driver's side, where the small third door provided access to the rear
seat.</TE>
<TE>   Autonomy Platform</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. has developed a body to fit the Autonomy
"skateboard" fuel-cell platform (Highway 1, Jan. 23) it introduced at
the Detroit auto show in January.</TE>
<TE>   Autonomy is a flat, wheeled platform that contains most of the
electronics and power train for a vehicle. It looks like an oversized
skateboard and is designed to accept a variety of body styles.</TE>
<TE>   The first one is the Hy-Wire, built over the last eight months and
scheduled to get a public introduction Sept. 26 at the Paris auto
show.</TE>
<TE>   GM developed Hy-Wire's chassis and body for the Autonomy's
electronic drive-by-wire system that eliminates many of the
mechanical and hydraulic links common in conventional cars.</TE>
<TE>   It uses a trio of hydrogen tanks mounted in the center of the
chassis to power a single, transverse-mounted electric motor that
drives the front wheels.</TE>
<TE>   GM says the power train is the same as what it used on its 2001
HydroGen 3 fuel-cell test vehicle and should give Hy-Wire a top speed
of 97 mph and a range of 60 miles.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Fly Over Report of Prius Battery Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent column about a Century City couple's problems with a Prius
hybrid that wouldn't keep a charge ("Couple Say They Get No Charge
Out of Their Toyota Prius," Highway 1, Aug. 7) elicited a slew of
e-mail from readers.</LD>
<LD>   Many defended the Prius and chastised me for writing about a
problem that Toyota officials characterized as an isolated incident.
But there were almost as many messages suggesting that the problem
was more common than Toyota admitted.</LD>
<LD>   The Aug. 7 column dealt with a letter from a Century City woman
(who asked to remain unidentified) who complained that her 2002 Prius
battery kept draining and that her dealer's service manager told her
and her husband that nothing was wrong with the car and that they
weren't driving it enough to keep the batteries charged.</LD>
<TE>   The Prius is propelled by a combination of gasoline engine and
electric motor and uses two kinds of batteries: a small one to
provide initial starting power and another, larger unit that provides
juice to propel the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   First, a few Prius defenders:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised you would print a major article on one buyer's bad
experience," wrote Alice Remer of Corona del Mar. "I am the owner of
a Prius [and] have never had trouble starting it."</TE>
<TE>   Reader Bruce Snyder questioned whether the column was an attempt
to "sabotage" hybrid sales and asked if I was influenced by "the
makers of ever-increasing, gas-guzzling, air-polluting SUVs."</TE>
<TE>   Other readers said they adore their hybrids and have never
experienced problems.</TE>
<TE>   But there were almost as many e-mails reporting problems similar
to the one reported in the earlier column. (The total is 20 e-mails:
11 praising Prius, and nine--eight Prius owners and one Honda Insight
owner--reporting problems.</TE>
<TE>   Reader Bob Walrath said he and his wife had the same
battery-draining experience with their 2001 Prius and were told they
weren't driving enough to keep the battery charged.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, Walrath told his dealer to keep the car until they had
figured out the problem. "It took them almost a month," he said. But
the dealer did provide a free loaner and a sympathetic service
manager, Walrath said.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble was with the auxiliary battery," he said. The dealer
ordered a new one and since then the Prius has been fine, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wasnok, service manager at Norwalk Toyota, confirmed that he's
had to replace bad Prius starter batteries for two customers.</TE>
<TE>   Reader Art Feldra wrote that the small starter battery in his
Prius was dead the first time he went to his garage after buying the
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "The service rep at my Toyota dealer was on the ball," Feldra
wrote. He realized that it was the small starter battery that was the
problem and replaced it.</TE>
<TE>   One reader disputed Toyota spokesman Sam Butto's Aug. 7 comment
that the car should not lose a charge unless it has been idle for a
couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he's generally happy with his Prius, David Wong
said he had two episodes in which the car would not start after
sitting in the garage for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He said a manager at the dealership informed him that the hybrid's
starter battery will discharge after sitting idle for about 10 days
and suggested he disconnect the battery if the car would be left idle
for a long period--the same advice Feldra received from his dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Leanne Twidwell of Rancho Palos Verdes also experienced battery
problems with her Prius and also was told at first that she wasn't
driving it enough.</TE>
<TE>   But her dealer finally found that the battery was defective and
ordered a new one, and the Prius has run properly ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Twidwell wrote that it seems "some of these cars have a battery
problem and either the dealers don't know it, or aren't looking for
it in the right place. Too bad Toyota doesn't put all the data
together and let the service departments know about this."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. Toyota did know there were problems with the small
auxiliary starter batteries in some of its 2001 Prius models,
according to spokesman John Hanson.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker said it was concerned that the battery was not
strong enough and decided midway through the 2001 model year that a
larger, higher-capacity battery was necessary and began installing
them in the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But Toyota did not issue service bulletins to alert dealers about
the problem, nor did the company inform dealers that new models were
getting larger batteries.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson said he's not surprised that dealerships didn't know how to
respond to the problem because "there was no official fix on it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he characterized the number of complaints by Prius owners
as so small that Toyota didn't think it warranted notifying dealers
and said the company still has no plans to do so. Toyota still views
the situation as an isolated problem, Hanson said, because it was a
"battery problem, not a systemic problem" with the vehicle. Most of
the 2001 and all 2002 models should now have the larger auxiliary
batteries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for me, well, I appreciate the benefits hybrid cars offer for
our environment.</TE>
<TE>   But if there's a defect in some of the vehicles' batteries, it
needs to be addressed, not dismissed. The better their reputation for
reliability, the more hybrids we'll see on the roads.</TE>

<LD>HATE CRIME</LD>
<LD>   The Story of a Dragging in Jasper, Texas</LD>
<LD>   by Joyce King</LD>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   240 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   "Hate Crime" is a compelling account of how three white men
dragged a black man to his tortured death with a chain attached to
the rear bumper of their pickup in the small east Texas town of
Jasper.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce King, a former reporter and anchor for CBS radio in Dallas,
was under heavy emotional strain throughout her reporting of the
death and the subsequent trial and sentencing of the three men. In
her book, she achieves a remarkable balance of candor, clarity and
feeling. A Southern black woman, King knows the territory.</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Texas, she was once riding in a car with her mother
while her aunt followed behind in a car with her children. State
troopers stopped both cars and charged her mother with impeding
traffic and her aunt with tailgating--though there were no other cars
on the road. Blacks in the South routinely expected that kind of
treatment from white authorities a generation ago. Two generations
ago the lynching of black men in the South was a common and often
festive occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Customs have changed in the South. The dragging of James Byrd Jr.
was done in the dead of night. No crowds cheered on the killers. The
mayor and police chief of Jasper were black. The three killers were
convicted by juries that were mostly male and white.</TE>
<TE>   But the ghastly crime cast a spotlight on a persistent strain of
race hatred in backward parts of the New South. Two of the three
white killers had, in the huge, sweltering Texas prison system,
became acquainted with a racist group known as the Confederate
Knights of America, and one of them bore numerous racist body
tattoos. These two men--John William King, who had tattoos, a
handsome man of 23 (and no relation to the author) and Lawrence
Russell Brewer, 31--were sentenced to death. The third, Shawn Allen
Berry, 23, who went along for the ride, was given a long sentence.</TE>
<TE>   It did not take long for law enforcement to pick up the flagrant
masses of evidence. As is fairly common in Jasper, a dry town in a
wet county, the men had been drinking with friends on that hot
Saturday night in June 1998. So had the victim. Byrd, 49, was known
to most of the white and black people in town as a genial guy who had
been in some small scrapes. This night he had been to a house party,
an end-of-the-week get-together common in the black community. He was
staggering home on foot when the white men picked him up for a ride.</TE>
<TE>   King emphasizes that on the weekends there is not much to do in
Jasper, a town of about 8,000. People work in the timber industry or
hold odd jobs. There are the usual fast-food places and a few stores.
Many of the whites seem notably rootless, from broken homes and
absent families, stuck in lousy jobs.</TE>
<TE>   From just such a background came King and Brewer, and from this
they went to prison for middling offenses. The author argues
emphatically that the Texas prison system is a breeding ground for
racial hatred and crime. This is the point that lifts "Hate Crime"
from the category of crime reporting to a powerfully persuasive
commentary on public policy.</TE>
<TE>   In the prison system, she writes, as many have before her, the
strong prey on the weak, extorting from them money, sex and
debasement.</TE>
<TE>   Races and ethnic groups try to band together for mutual protection
in an environment of squalor, hatred and violence.</TE>
<TE>   King does not claim to have all the answers, but she has a few:
Stop building more prisons, separate nonviolent from violent
offenders, train the mostly rural and white prison guards how to deal
with their largely black and Latino prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Implicit in "Hate Crime" seems to be King's conclusion that
perhaps only time, hard work and good can finally make such awful
crimes a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Her praise for the predominantly white law enforcement officers,
lawyers and jurors who solved the crime and got the convictions seems
to say that there is, after all, a way out of the Old South of her
childhood and the unspeakable decades before.</TE>

<DH>Projet Mobilivre, on a cross-country tour, offers
alternative, handmade publications</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not like any bookmobile you've ever seen. It isn't local, you
can't check out anything, and all the books are handmade. It could
also be the only place you'll ever get to read "The Grilled Cheese
Sandwich Book," with covers that look like bread and pages that are
colored yellow, or "What Teachers Don't Know," a self-explanatory
zine made by 8-to 12-year-old students.</LD>
<LD>   Projet Mobilivre, an alternative bookmobile that's been roaming
the country for more than two months, will be parked on Alvarado
Street in Los Angeles and open to the public today and Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   An Airstream trailer that's been converted to a bookmobile,
complete with shelves and seating, Projet Mobilivre is home to 300
handmade books, zines and comics.</LD>
<TE>   "Art books get in to libraries and galleries, but they're usually
behind glass. Similarly, zines are not things that people outside
zine culture have access to or know about. The reason we're doing
this project is to go beyond that," said Leila Pourtavaf, 26. One of
Projet Mobilivre's founders, she has been traveling with the
bookmobile since it left Philadelphia on June 20.</TE>
<TE>   Headquartered in Philadelphia and Montreal, Projet Mobilivre
(French for "Bookmobile Project") was the brainchild of five Canadian
college students. All of them are zine and book makers who share the
belief that independently produced media are inaccessible to the
masses and should be shared more widely with those who don't usually
get to see it.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by a 1998 art show featuring handmade books, Projet
Mobilivre's members wanted to take the idea to a larger audience and
came up with the idea of the bookmobile to do that.</TE>
<TE>   This year's tour is the bookmobile's second. Last year, it was
supposed to stop in L.A., but the van that was hauling it kept
breaking down, forcing Projet Mobilivre to turn back before heading
over the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   During its four-month tour this year, the bookmobile is stopping
at community centers, schools, festivals, bookstores, art centers,
retirement homes and libraries throughout the U.S. and Canada. The
collective had wanted to stop at a women's reformatory in Ohio but
was prevented from doing so because the warden objected to the
political nature of some books and zines, which tackle subjects
including racism, homophobia and gender equality.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a traditional bookmobile, the items on display at Projet
Mobilivre can't be checked out. The 300 pieces on display were
selected from 600 submissions and represent a variety of people, art
forms, topics, structures and writing styles. Many of them are one of
a kind.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are like, 'I really want to own this,' but that isn't
the point of our project," said Pourtavaf, who will provide contact
information for an artist if she has it. "It's to show people what's
available and encourage other people to do it." To help achieve that
goal, Projet Mobilivre hosts bookbinding and zine-making workshops at
almost every stop.</TE>
<TE>   "Books and zines are a really awesome form of expression that
could be a lot more popular," said Lisbeth Pelsue, 24, a Projet
Mobilivre collective member who boarded the bookmobile in San
Francisco and will travel with it to Albuquerque. "They're such a
narrative form that they allow people who don't get heard a whole lot
to say things that are really valuable and important to them."</TE>
<TE>   Pelsue, who used to produce a zine that chronicled her personal
experiences as a political activist, is one of three volunteers who
are staffing the bookmobile while it is in L.A. During its tour,
Projet Mobilivre members ride along for anywhere from a week to two
months, then swap places with another member. Though the volunteers
sometimes have a place to stay while on tour, at least two of them
sleep on site every night to ensure the bookmobile's safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially we wanted to do a bus ... but driving a bus is a huge
hassle," Pourtavaf said. "An Airstream was cheaper and safer ... and
it's also really good-looking."</TE>
<TE>   Projet Mobilivre will be outside 33- 1/3 Books, 1200 Alvarado St.,
Los Angeles, today and Thursday. Admission is free. Hours: 1 to 8
p.m. Information: (267) 879-7408.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rose copes with the chaos, noise and clutter of her apartment by
seeking comfort in food, sometimes devouring a whole package of Oreos
in her room.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-year-old, who wears large adult-size clothing and shoes,
lives with her single mother, whose mild mental disability makes it
difficult for her to keep track of daily household chores and to
address Rose's weight problem constructively.</LD>
<LD>   Then there are the frequent house guests who stay for long periods
of time.</LD>
<TE>   "People tend to take advantage, and they show up and sleep on the
couch or the floor," said Mary Robertson, the service coordinator for
a San Gabriel Valley area center that assists the family and teaches
the mother parenting and independent-living skills.</TE>
<TE>   The guests sometimes force Rose out of her room, and she has to
sleep on the sofa. The fifth-grader often responds by tuning out and
watching television or videos--and eating.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows she has to work on her weight," said her 34-year-old
mother, who supports three children with disability benefits. "Rose
knows she should exercise."</TE>
<TE>   Rose believes she is having a hard time measuring up physically
because of her weight, and mentally because she is in special
education classes. In the past, she has taken medication for
depression.</TE>
<TE>   "She is being told by her mother that she is not like other
people, and she is kind of a loner because she is a lot bigger than
other kids in her class," said Robertson, who hopes that a week at
Stanley Ranch Woodcraft Rangers camp will give the child a
much-needed break.</TE>
<TE>   When Rose returned from camp last year, she told stories about new
friends and the walks she took at the Castaic Lake camp. She already
has her sleeping bag ready and is looking forward to going back to
see friends she made last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't tend to do a lot of activities outside the home,
except for school," said Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a really positive experience."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit
www.latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<DL>PASO ROBLES</DL>
<LD>"Sing to me, baby," I say. "Show me what you can do."</LD>
<LD>   The rental speedboat lifts out of the water like a dragonfly--on
gossamer wings, zipping across the calm lake. I'm feeling pretty
good, off to surprise the kids with this, the last available ski boat
of the day. With only me in the boat, it's soon skimming along at 45
mph. On water, that feels like 90.</LD>
<LD>   "Sing to me, baby," I say to the boat's impressive engine.</LD>
<TE>   And with that, the big inner tube I'd also rented flies up out of
the bow, catches the sharp edge of the windshield and deflates like a
cheap balloon.</TE>
<TE>   Something's singing to me, all right. It's the throaty gasp of a
$200 toy inner tube.</TE>
<TE>   So I circle back to the marina, get another inner tube from the
guy--"I'm going to have to charge you for that"--and head out again
for our lakeside cabin.</TE>
<TE>   You know how it is when a day starts badly and you suddenly get
the feeling you're in a bad-luck rut, that this one little piece of
bad luck isn't the only one of the day? Bad luck is lining up for
you. Feel it in your gut. Just wait.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, you got a boat?" the boy asks excitedly when I reach the
cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "And two tubes," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!"</TE>
<TE>   "One has a hole in it," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "The boat?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, the inner tube," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   Boats, they like to say, are just holes in the water into which
you pour money. And kids. Sandwiches. Drinks. A wife or two. Four
kinds of sunscreen. Towels. Cameras. A change of clothes. A radio.</TE>
<TE>   By the time you put all that in the rental boat, there is little
room for the guy who rented the boat. I step into the boat and stub
my toe on a ski.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK, Dad?"</TE>
<TE>   "Never better."</TE>
<TE>   Because, like Jesus, I am never better than when I am on the
water. Never happier. Never more away from things.</TE>
<TE>   Even sober, I don't feel sober. Step onto a boat, and you get that
two-drink feeling without the two drinks. Every hour is happy hour.
That may be why, in those summer blockbusters, the shark always wins.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone untie the ropes?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," says the boy, in an act of volunteerism rarely seen on
land.</TE>
<TE>   "I love boats," the boy says.</TE>
<TE>   And soon we're out on the water, our sun-kissed crew of summer
travelers, two families up on Lake Nacimiento for fun, fresh air and
a little skiing.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to wake-board?" the boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   Few things race my heart like water-skiing or tubing, but the
wake-boarding fad hasn't really found me yet.</TE>
<TE>   Far as I can tell, wake boarders stand upon a board and across the
boat's wake like an out-of-control driver over a median, going
airborne, then crashing hard and inelegantly.</TE>
<TE>   The slalom skier, meanwhile, turns a smooth apostrophe in the
glassy lake, sending curtains of water 30 feet high. If wake-boarding
is the Backstreet Boys, slalom skiing is Fred Astaire.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to wake-board, Dad?" my daughter asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe later," I lie.</TE>
<TE>   I've tried wake-boarding. In Tahoe last summer, the boat pulled me
underwater like an 80-gallon drum. Submerged, I passed more water
than Hoover Dam. Algae began to coat my teeth. A bluegill swam up my
nose.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't working," I began to think after 15 seconds under the
frigid lake.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK, Dad?" the boy asked when my body finally surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I said. "But I caught a nice bluegill."</TE>
<TE>   Like many master criminals, I have the aural awareness of a
werewolf. I can hear a scream before it leaves the lips. I can hear a
siren before the cop does.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Lord, he's coming for us," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "The ranger."</TE>
<TE>   Just past Christmas Cove, the ranger begins to chase us. Puts on
his flashing blue light and whoop-whoops the siren. Everyone on the
little lake pauses to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pulling up along side you," the ranger announces.</TE>
<TE>   And I think: "Finally, they're going to arrest my kids. Finally."</TE>
<TE>   They've been asking for it, my kids. The way they slurp their
cereal. The way they attempt to talk to me when they're brushing
their teeth. Especially the way they leave junk all over the house,
despite being warned repeatedly by exasperated parents, sore-backed
and aging.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that belong there?" you ask a kid repeatedly. Repeatedly,
the kid will say, "yes."</TE>
<TE>   "See your license?" the ranger says.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, he's talking to me.</TE>
<TE>   This is surprising because there are other, bigger crimes
happening everywhere and in broad daylight. For example, Ethan Hawke
is publishing a big-time novel. This fall, Deion Sanders will be a
regular on NFL pregame shows on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Worst of all, I have this brother-in-law who'll pour ketchup all
over a $20 piece of steak. Been doing it for years. He's a serial
killer of sirloin, this guy.</TE>
<TE>   Point is, stuff that should be stopped is rarely stopped. You want
crime? You should see what they're charging me for this ski boat.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I see your license?" the ranger says again.</TE>
<TE>   The infraction? The boy and his buddy Matt were dangling their
legs over the back of the ski boat in a way the ranger ruled
dangerous. Fair enough. I would've guessed a warning.</TE>
<TE>   "You ever give warnings on something like this?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Zero tolerance," the ranger says.</TE>
<TE>   Zero tolerance. Usually, I'm all for it, especially when it
involves someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the cynic in me says that this ranger is preying on
tourists, that he zeros in on rental boats because the locals would
give him more grief.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the only green in these sun-parched hills is from all the
cash we've spent in the past week.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the rationalization of a rich man, the kind I abhor. I
bite my tongue and take the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "You can call this number here on the back," the ranger says.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, Dad," the boy says as the ranger pulls away.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knew?" I say, poorer and a little wiser.</TE>
<TE>   After a moment, the chatter returns to the luckless SS Minnow, our
jinxed but happy rental vessel.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, where's my towel?" the little girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, where's my sunscreen?" her friend Hannah asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Who ate my sandwich?" I ask a boy with a mouthful of bread.</TE>
<TE>   And, slowly, our little summer voyage resumes.</TE>

<HD>A Home Hunter Attached to the Garage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I have been house-hunting for six months now, and if
the big Realtor in the sky happens to be reading this, we are quite
ready to move beyond hunting into actual gathering, thankyouverymuch.
Not that it's as physically demanding as it might sound since we are
looking for a house in South Pasadena where, apparently, only three
houses are allowed on the market at any given time. Which is probably
why we like the city so darn much.</LD>
<LD>   Over the months, we have looked at a fair number of houses and
learned that any tour of property in Southern California invariably
winds up in the garage.</LD>
<LD>   Now, if it were up to my husband, I think we would begin in the
garage--he has been known to walk right through the kitchen oblivious
to the fact that there seems to be no room for a full-size stove, his
eyes on the door off the laundry room or backyard that leads to the
garage. And I know what he is thinking. He is thinking: Is there an
additional room attached to that garage? Has it been or could it be
converted into an office? If not, is there enough street parking that
we could convert the whole thing into an office?</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't even have to be an office. It just has to be a room.
Where one could be alone, in relative silence, a Woolfian room into
which I would be allowed entry but the children would not. Daddy's
room, I call it now. "Go find Daddy's room," I tell the kids when we
enter an empty house. It distracts them while I try to figure out
where we would put the stove, since it won't fit in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I don't appreciate a good garage when I see it. Growing
up in Maryland, I was fascinated by garages. My grandparents, who
lived one county over, had a garage, and when I was small I thought
it a mysterious and beautiful place, probably because I wasn't
allowed in it. While they sat in lawn chairs on the back patio, I
would peer through the doorway, leaning into the dark scent--oil and
metal and old cut grass, the tarry smell of roof shingles.</TE>
<TE>   I could see the outlines of the treacherous garden tools--the
beaks of the various hedge shears, the eerie line of shovels, the
coffee cans full of screws and nails and bolts. In the middle of it
all my grandpa's big Mercury lurked in the darkness, gleaming like
the presidential limousine.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, my aunt and uncle had a house with a garage that
included a grease-pit, which, as you can imagine, my cousins
immediately claimed as a clubhouse. But they lived in the next state
so the ecstasy for me was intermittent.</TE>
<TE>   My family never had a garage; we had a basement, which has many of
the same features, literally and imaginatively, as a garage. Dank
concrete, check; tool bench, check; storage space, moment of
hesitation in doorway caused by spooky silhouettes, check, check. No
car, of course, but the washer and dryer filled in as Major Family
Appliance. As a child, I considered the garage a housing addition to
aspire to, like a swimming pool or a secret staircase. (Now that I
have a garage, I discover it adds not a whit of glamour or mystery to
my life.) I find it ironic that I, and many of my friends, grew up
garageless in the East, where snow and salt and rain were actually
known to mess with a car's appearance, but here in temperate Southern
California, it is the rare house that doesn't have one. In fact, many
garages occupy more square footage than, say, the sleeping quarters
and certainly, the kitchen. A few we've seen have had
questionable-looking doors, doors that sort of shlumped rather than
shut, and one had a nice window frame but no window, which was quite
odd.</TE>
<TE>   But, for the most part, they were good, solid structures, with the
familiar motif of tool bench and boxes, outgrown bicycles and old
lamps stacked against unfinished walls to the skeleton of the roof.
They smelled like my grandpa's garage (except for the cut grass--no
one seems to cut their own grass anymore). And so, for a minute,
during every house tour, I get to imagine that I'm 6 or 7 again and
everyone I love is still alive and we're all going to eat steamed
crabs and corn on the cob any minute now. It's a nice moment to have
in the middle of yet another shoulder-dropping realization that this
isn't the right house either.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe next time, we'll just buy the garage.</TE>

<LD>Three-Banded Armadillos</LD>
<LD>   Imagine that you are traveling in Brazil's open grassland and you
come across a three-banded armadillo.</LD>
<LD>   What do you think this animal would do?</LD>
<TE>   As a way to defend itself, the armadillo would first try to run
back to its burrow or dig a hole and hide. If that didn't work, the
armadillo would roll into a ball.</TE>
<TE>   Armadillos are buff brown and have hexagon patterns on their outer
shell. Although the shell looks hard like that of a turtle, the
armadillo's small bony plates actually feel more like hard rubber.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Zoo has a pair of three-banded armadillos named
Elmo and Mona. These year-old animals can be seen in the window
exhibits at the Winnick Family Animal Care Center.</TE>
<TE>   Elmo and Mona are kept in separate exhibits because they are
solitary animals.</TE>
<TE>   They are only put in the same area during breeding season.</TE>
<TE>   You can meet Elmo and Mona and learn about lots of other animals
at the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends through Labor Day, the zoo has special entertainment
and story readings by celebrities and media personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Every child who visits also will receive a free "Go Wild About
Reading" activity book. For more zoo information, call (323) 644-6400
or visit www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<HD>Plot in the Black Sparrow Saga Takes Unexpected Turn</HD>
<DH>Boston-based publisher agrees to take over California
house's distinguished backlist</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of Black Sparrow Press, California's premier literary
publisher for nearly 40 years, was extraordinary from the start. And
it now appears it will have that rarest of things--a legitimately
happy ending.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, 71-year-old John Martin, Black Sparrow's
founder and editor, announced he had sold the rights to the work of
Charles Bukowski, John Fante and Paul Bowles--the three bestselling
authors on his 185-title list-- and would halt operations July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Boston-based publisher David R. Godine has agreed to take
over the California house's vast and distinguished backlist, as well
as Martin's contracts with such contemporary writers as Los Angeles
poet and author Wanda Coleman and poets Diane Wakoski and Edward
Sanders.</LD>
<TE>   Godine said that Black Sparrow will go forward as a separate
imprint of his press under the direction of an editor yet to be
hired. "I want to keep it very much a West Coast list," he said this
week in a telephone interview. "The East Coast has enough presses
that reflect its concerns and the voices of its writers, but there
are too few who do what John did for the West. Therefore, that's
where our focus will remain."</TE>
<TE>   "It's all been taken care of beautifully," Martin said from his
offices in Santa Rosa. "Every one of my authors now has a publisher.
I just stepped out of the way, and David caught the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is a catch resulting from a series of events Godine
laughingly says "can only be called Martin-esque."</TE>
<TE>   Black Sparrow's latest chapter began earlier this year, when New
York-based Ecco, an imprint of News Corp.'s HarperCollins, agreed to
pay a "seven-figure" price for 49 books by Bukowski, Fante and
Bowles, as well as the rights to five unpublished collections of
poetry by Bukowski, who died in 1994. Fante, who died in 1983, wrote
fiction and screenplays, including the classic Los Angeles novels
"Wait Until Spring, Bandini" and "Ask the Dust." Bowles, who died in
1999, was an expatriate writer, composer and poet, particularly
admired for his short stories. As part of the deal, Martin also
agreed to edit the new Bukowski collections, which are to contain
most of the author's 800 unpublished poems.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the sale, Martin and Daniel Halpern, Ecco's
longtime editorial director, said they were discussing the New York
press' acquisition of other Black Sparrow authors. When those
negotiations failed, Martin approached Godine with what Godine called
"an act of unspeakable generosity."</TE>
<TE>   If the Boston publisher would agree to take over Black Sparrow's
entire backlist and its contracts with living authors, Martin offered
Godine not only all remaining literary rights, but also 96,000
volumes from his inventory of printed books for the sum of $1.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I had 80,000 books by Bukowski, Fante and Bowles in my
inventory and 96,000 by everybody else," Martin explained. "Those
96,000 volumes cost me more than $200,000 to print, and by
essentially giving them to David, he was guaranteed the instant cash
flow that will allow him to publish and pay royalties to my living
authors."</TE>
<TE>   Godine called the arrangement "a real John Martin kind of deal,
which is to say, he knows exactly how he wants things to come out but
gets you to make the move. John called me right after he made the
deal with HarperCollins--and before it had been announced--and asked,
'What do you think?'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, it sounds great, but what happens to the rest of your
list, and he said, 'Oh, I just may give it to a distributor.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, that's terrible because no distributor can do justice to
those books. So he said, 'I think you're right. Why don't you take it
for a dollar?'</TE>
<TE>   "So, I said, 'Let me come out and see you.' But John said, 'Oh,
don't bother. It's too hot out here. I'll just send you a one-page
agreement that I've drafted myself, and that will be it.'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Well, at least let me come out and we can have dinner.'
I did, and when I got there, I found all the boxes of books packed
and ready to ship to us--for which he paid."</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Godine are still negotiating over how the Black Sparrow
name will be used in the future, Martin said. "I was a one-man band,
and I don't want the changes they'll inevitably make to reflect on
me. They'll never spend the money I did on printing, for example."</TE>
<TE>   Godine agrees there will be changes: "We're going to do things
John always resisted, like printing bar codes and prices on the back
covers. John hated all that."</TE>
<TE>   Once he finds an editor for the new imprint, Godine said, he plans
"to bring back any important Black Sparrow book that has gone out of
print. Then, we'll meet the commitments John has made on manuscripts
by living Black Sparrow authors. Finally, I'd like to add to the
list--initially, in guarded and careful ways, then more
aggressively--though in John's West Coast spirit, which I very much
want to keep alive. Jack London, for example, is a California author
in whom I'm very interested. Many of his important works are out of
print, and I'd like to do something about that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Godine said, Martin's famously intimate and accommodating
relationships with his authors will be impossible to maintain. "My
impression," he said, "is that John simply did everything for those
people. He published everything they wrote, and if they called and
said they needed a new refrigerator, he bought them one. I'm not that
well financed or kindly disposed. Reading these authors, as I have
been doing, you recognize that John has published books whose voices
are totally distinct. Diane Wakoski and Wanda Coleman are good
examples of poets whose voices he heard as no one else ever had. The
result is a uniquely focused list. Anyway, talk to me in five years,
and we'll see if I've screwed it up."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman is anxious and hopeful about working with Godine. "They
don't know me and I don't know them," she said. "I know they are an
excellent publisher with a sense of integrity and a love of the
printed word--things they share with John Martin. They care about
books, which is something a majority of publishers no longer do."</TE>
<TE>   Martin said he has finished editing two of the five Bukowski
collections he owes Ecco and plans to complete the other three by the
end of the year. His wife, Barbara, will design the covers for all
five volumes, as she has for all Black Sparrow's books for the past
36 years.</TE>
<TE>   That done, Martin said, "We're both going to the window to shout,
'We're free, we're finally free.' "</TE>
<TE>   It is a proclamation that Martin said he can make with a clear
conscience. "It's just God's grace that everything worked out for
everybody in the best way possible. I didn't leave any victims on the
road behind me. Black Sparrow gave me a life I can look back on
without regret."</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were spending a week at the camp where Uncle Ruben
works as a nature guide in the San Bernardino Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   "Today I am going to show you a water-safety skill--how to float
on your pants," Uncle Ruben said.</LD>
<LD>   Maria and her younger brother Alfonso looked at each other with
surprise.</LD>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben told the children to put their regular clothes back on
over their swimming outfits. Maria and Alfonso quickly put on their
long pants and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben said, "It is important to know how to float,
especially if you ever fall into deep water without a life jacket."</TE>
<TE>   "Watch carefully," said Uncle Ruben, who was fully clothed, with
his bathing suit on underneath. He took off his shoes and jumped into
the pool. He had to go under the water and pull his pants off inside
out to get them off. Maria and Alfonso were laughing. Uncle Ruben
quickly tied a knot in the end of each pant leg, and then he hurled
the pants over his head, capturing air in the pants. The pants looked
like a balloon.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben was able to float on his air-filled pants for a few
minutes. When the air went out, he quickly hurled his pants over his
head again so they filled up with air again.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben got out of the pool and told Maria and Alfonso to try.
They looked at each other, laughed, and then jumped in.</TE>
<TE>   In a minute, they had their pants off and had managed to fill them
with a little air. They were floating on their pants, laughing,
giggling and trying to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's practice this every day," Alfonso yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "Always make sure there's an adult watching you when you're in the
pool," Uncle Ruben advised. He was glad that the children had learned
a new water-safety skill.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navigating her 18-wheeler through the thirsty summer terrain of
Central California, veteran truck driver Alice Chaney becomes an
impromptu tour guide: "On the right, we have desert," she says,
waving a hand toward the passenger window. "On the left, even more
desert."</LD>
<LD>   Chaney, a 47-year-old grandmother who lives in North Carolina's
misty Blue Ridge Mountains, can't wait to get out of the state, but
it isn't just the scenery. To long-haul truckers, California is
"communist country," a state that not only restricts them to the far
right lanes of the freeway but limits them to 55 mph, the lowest
trucker speed limit in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The refrigerated trailer Chaney is hauling contains 70,000 pounds
of lettuce, onions, celery and broccoli she picked up in Salinas. In
four days, it's due in the Bronx. Though she's under a tight time
constraint, Chaney still plays by the rules. She pokes along on the
right, her speedometer hovering just above the legal limit as cars
speed by in the fast lane.</LD>
<TE>   From the relatively low perspective of four wheels--where most
Americans sit as they commute to work or haul the family off on
summer vacation--it's hard to see what's going on in the elevated
cabs of America's big rigs. In many ways, Chaney reflects the
changing face of the trucking industry--an industry where speeding
trucks are increasingly the exception, where insurers and regulators
are raising the bar on safety requirements and where more women and
minorities are climbing into the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   As evidenced in a week spent on the road headed east with Chaney
and west with two other drivers--a mother-daughter team--there is
plenty that hasn't changed. The stress of delivering loads safely and
on time is never-ending, as is the cat-and-mouse relationship between
trucks and cars. And many truck drivers are not far removed from the
stereotypical Southern white male who stuffs his lip with chewing
tobacco and rants unintelligibly into a CB radio as he bullies his
way through traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But, just as this post-Sept. 11 summer is different for drivers of
"four-wheelers," it is different for the drivers of 18-wheelers. They
are wrestling with heightened ethnic tensions on the roadways,
worries about the stalled economy, and an underlying fear of new acts
of terrorism--the latter of which the government is asking truckers
to help fight.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Her Cool</TE>
<TE>   It's pushing 90 degrees outside, but Chaney is keeping cool. Her
air conditioner is on, and her long, strawberry blond hair is pulled
into a high ponytail. A jumbo-size travel mug sits on the floor next
to her seat.</TE>
<TE>   Driving with her right elbow propped on the stick shift, Chaney
exudes the sort of calm confidence that can only come from
experience. In the 22 years she's been trucking, she's logged more
than 2 million miles. She's never had an accident. Her last speeding
ticket was 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be really aware of what's going on," Chaney says as
she wheels up the 101 between fields of onions.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do a hundred times more damage than a car could even think
of doing."</TE>
<TE>   Chaney's enviable safety record is not one that all drivers of
cars or trucks share. Though car drivers complain that truckers are a
road hazard--that they speed, tailgate and box them in--truckers say
the problem is the four-wheelers--who cut them off without signaling,
lurch across lanes and pay more attention to their phone
conversations than what's happening on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Still, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, the number of fatalities in truck-related crashes is
at an all-time low, having dropped for the fourth consecutive year.
And a recent study by the American Automobile Assn. indicates that
cars are at fault 75% of the time in accidents between cars and big
rigs. One major reason: Car drivers simply don't know very much about
trucks. They don't know that it takes at least the length of an
entire football field for them to stop, or that there are dangerous
blind spots on every side of an 18-wheeler. Few, if any, states even
mention trucks in driver education. That puts the onus on
truckers--not only to avoid making dangerous moves of their own, but
also to counter all the ones by unknowing or reckless automobile
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Every move made in a big rig has exaggerated consequences. Chaney
is slow and deliberate as she backs her truck into the long and
narrow parking space between two other big rigs in a line of several
dozen. Her rig, which is 4 1/2 cars long, is completely straight. It
has to be. There is only 3 feet of clearance on either side.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney is at Foxy Foods in Salinas, the first of three pickups
she'll make before heading back to the East Coast. She's able to get
her load right away, but some of the other drivers have to wait for
hours. As she pulls out of the loading dock at 4 p.m. Monday, two
pizza delivery cars zoom into the lot, dropping off orders to the
drivers who can't leave because they're on call. Her next pickup is
at 2 a.m., her third at 8 a.m. In all, she will spend almost an
entire day picking up her load--time for which she is not earning
money. In trucking, speed is everything. Paid by the mile, Chaney
only makes money when she's moving.</TE>
<TE>   At her final pickup point before heading east, Chaney is pulling
out of Dole Fresh Foods in Marina at about 1 p.m. Tuesday when she
sees the commotion.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen drivers, some wearing turbans, are standing in the
middle of the parking lot being questioned by police. The CB radio
crackles to life with slurs and speculation: "Aren't those the guys
that blew up the World Trade Center?" one driver witnessing the scene
suggests. "I think they were gonna blow up the loading dock," says
another.</TE>
<TE>   The truth of the matter: One of the truckers hit the mirror of
another driver's truck, and the Dole security guard called California
Highway Patrol to resolve the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers bump into each other's mirrors all the time, Chaney says,
but she's never seen anyone call the police about it. Fear and
prejudice have fueled suspicion and disrespect toward truckers and
others presumed to be of Arab descent since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   That pressure coincides with increasing numbers of immigrants and
minorities entering the trucking profession in recent years. Though
numbers are not broken out by specific ethnicity, in 1991, 22.8% of
truck drivers were nonwhite; today, 26.9% of them are.</TE>
<TE>   The number of women drivers has also been growing in recent years,
though more slowly. In 1991, 4.1% of truck drivers were female,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, 5.3% are,
and their numbers continue to increase as they leave lower-paying
jobs, retrain from jobs that are evaporating in a down economy or
join their husbands to drive as a team, as Chaney did when she first
started, though her husband no longer drives.</TE>
<TE>   This new gender and ethnic mix doesn't sit well with many of the
old-guard truckers; in CB chatter, sexist and racist remarks that
would not be tolerated in many other workplaces seem to fly freely.
And at truck stops and loading docks, where truckers come face to
face with one another, there is little friendly chitchat between the
differing groups.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisted to Spot Terrorists</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government wants to enlist the help of the nation's 3.1
million commercial truckers in spotting terrorist activity. They are
among the "millions of American workers who, in the daily course of
their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or
suspicious activity in public places," according to the U.S.
Department of Justice which, this month, is rolling out its Terrorist
Information and Prevention System, or TIPS--"a national system for
reporting suspicious and potentially terrorist-related activity."</TE>
<TE>   A similar, though smaller, program was already underway via the
American Trucking Assns. Highway Watch program, which has been
recruiting drivers into "America's Trucking Army" since April.</TE>
<TE>   Highway Watch was founded by individual states and their local law
enforcement in the late '90s to teach truckers about safety. A
security component was added after Sept. 11 to educate them in how to
combat terrorism. They are encouraged to look for trucks that are
parked in unusual places, such as highway overpasses and underpasses,
and to be aware of anyone who appears to be "casing." About 17 states
already participate in the program, with about two new states coming
on board every month.</TE>
<TE>   Driving through the mesas of New Mexico, Chaney says she's heard
of TIPS but doesn't know what to look for. In the thousand or so
miles of scorched landscapes in California and Arizona, she has
passed thousands of trucks, but it's almost impossible to figure out
what is inside of them--few are labeled with anything other than the
name of the trucking company.</TE>
<TE>   "If the FBI experts with their spy satellites and pro espionage
gear failed to stop terrorism, why would truck drivers be able to do
it?" Chaney asks.</TE>
<TE>   Counterterrorism experts know how difficult it is to spot a
terrorist, which is why both the TIPS and ATA programs offer
training, but there is little money to get the word out. In its war
against terrorism, the federal government has allocated $1.5 billion
to aviation, but only $500,000 to trucking.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, many experts believe the next terrorist attack could
happen with a truck bomb. After all, the largest terrorist attack on
U.S. soil before Sept. 11 was in 1995, when Timothy McVeigh exploded
a Ryder rental truck filled with ammonium nitrate and racing fuel
outside the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City. Two years
earlier, a Ryder rental van filled with 1,500 pounds of
fertilizer-based explosive and compressed hydrogen gas was exploded
in the parking garage of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying terrorists is only part of the danger, however.
Trucks, especially those carrying hazardous materials, run the risk
of being hijacked. Many companies, like the one Chaney works for,
install satellite dishes on their trucks so they can keep careful
track of where they are.</TE>
<TE>   Making the Switch</TE>
<TE>   The sun went down long ago, but the temperature is still over 100
in Texas when Chaney pulls into a truck stop in Amarillo at 2 a.m.
She is switching trailers with another team of drivers, who will
continue hauling her produce to the East Coast. Chaney will turn
around and head back to Los Angeles with their load of dry-cleaning
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 hours at the wheel, Chaney not only craves but is legally
required to sleep. The federal government dictates that Chaney, who
drives solo, must rest eight hours for every 10 she is on the road.
She is allowed to drive a maximum of 70 hours in eight days.</TE>
<TE>   Becky Thunder, 61, and Misty Rosewall, 33, the mother-daughter
driving team taking Chaney's trailer east, are subject to the same
rules, but, unlike Chaney, one can sleep while the other drives.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewall had been driving, but her mother is about to take over.
They take a 20-minute break and head into the truck stop. Fried
chicken, fried potatoes and hot dogs are warming under heat lamps
next to the cashier. Thunder passes them up in favor of a cup of
coffee. Rosewall heads to the bathroom, where the floor is sticky
with oil and dirt and paper towels overflow from the trash bin. They
meet back at the truck, where Thunder will drive until dawn while
Rosewall takes a bunk.</TE>
<TE>   It's 8:45 am. Wednesday when Thunder pulls off Interstate 40 into
a truck stop near Oklahoma City. Her miniature poodle is sitting on
the passenger seat. A cigarette lighter and a tube of lipstick are
propped in the ashtray for easy access. "Misty," Thunder calls,
ripping open the Velcro on the heavy curtain behind the driver's
seat, then reaching for her makeup. "Breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   A second dog scampers out, followed by Rosewall, whose short red
hair is stuck to one side of her head, her eyes bloodshot from a
fitful and bumpy night's sleep. Rosewall mists her hair with a water
bottle, and they walk inside--passing the washers and dryers where
truckers can do laundry and the line where drivers are waiting their
turn to take a shower. Thunder and Rosewall haven't showered for a
couple days, and they won't until they get back to North Carolina.
The produce they're carrying is perishable and must be delivered on
time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a person has to eat, and they head to the Iron Skillet for
breakfast, where they pass on the eggs, greasy hash browns and
biscuits with gravy in favor of the salad bar. They are trying to
lose weight, or at least not gain anymore, since each has put on 20
pounds in the years they've been trucking.</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast, Thunder returns a stack of audio books she rented
at a different truck stop and picks up a couple more. The tapes can
be rented at almost every chain truck stop in the country and dropped
off somewhere different. For Thunder, who prefers to drive at night
while Rosewall is sleeping, they are perfect company.</TE>
<TE>   So is her dog. Animals are increasingly commonplace in truckers'
cabs. At almost every truck stop, there are drivers walking poodles,
chows and Rottweilers. Thunder and Rosewall say they've also seen
drivers with ferrets, boa constrictors and parrots.</TE>
<TE>   Tiring Work, Decent Pay</TE>
<TE>   Driving a truck may be lonely and exhausting work, but it pays
relatively well. A typical driver makes about $40,000 a year;
experienced drivers can make $70,000.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewall and Thunder split 36 cents a mile. They travel between
5,500 and 6,200 miles a week, and each earn about $35,000 a year.Both
live in Mount Airy, N.C., where Rosewall was able to buy her own
house about two years ago. Thunder rents and sometimes wonders if
it's worth the $325 she pays for her three-bedroom house, since she's
only there three or four days a month.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm home two or three weeks, I get antsy for the smell of
diesel," says Thunder. She started driving trucks nine years ago,
when her typesetting job was phased out, and her daughter, who had
already been driving for four years, encouraged her to give it a try.</TE>
<TE>   It is Friday when Rosewall and Thunder arrive at the headquarters
of WLA, the North Carolina-based trucking company that employs them.
While another driver takes the produce they've carried up to New
York, they will leave Mount Airy on Saturday morning, picking up a
load of automobile air and oil filters from Charlotte, S.C., and
taking it to California. They are due Monday morning in Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   It's a 2,400-mile trip, but Rosewall and Thunder are accustomed to
driving across the country in two days. They've crisscrossed the
nation so many times they know exactly how many miles it is across
any given state on any freeway.</TE>
<TE>   There is exceptionally high turnover in long-haul trucking--90% or
more a year--as truckers hop from one company to the next, leave
long-haul for short-haul or leave the industry altogether.
Experienced drivers are a hot commodity in the business that delivers
67% of all freight in the country. In three-quarters of all U.S.
communities, trucks are the only means of delivering goods.</TE>
<TE>   Many insurance companies are requiring experienced drivers as a
condition of coverage--one of many measures they're taking to reduce
their risk. Another is "governed" accelerators. To get better
insurance rates, many freight companies modify their trucks so they
can't go above a designated speed no matter how hard the driver
presses the accelerator. WLA governs their trucks at 74 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Yakking on the CB Radio</TE>
<TE>   When traffic is jammed, it's not speed that's an issue. It's
Saturday, about 2:30 p.m., somewhere east of Atlanta, and the traffic
is backed up for miles. Thunder is driving. She turns up the volume
on her CB radio to find out more--where does the delay begin, how
many miles does it last, how much time will it take, is there an
alternate route. The CB radio is buzzing with truckers looking for
the same information--and complaints about the behavior of
motorcyclists and car drivers.</TE>
<TE>   When the driver of a black Toyota tries to bypass the jam by
driving slowly up the shoulder, a trucker pulls over to block its
path. His colleagues get on the horn to congratulate themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Bashing car drivers on the CB is a favorite pastime. So is trash
talk to and about women. Strippers at roadside clubs and "lot
lizards," or truck stop prostitutes, frequently jump on the radio to
lure men off the road, which is why many drivers, especially female
drivers like Thunder and Rosewall, prefer to keep the radio turned
off. They only turn it on when they need to learn about traffic
conditions, or to give "bear reports," telling other truckers they've
spotted "a full-grown bear" or "plain wrapper"--a marked or unmarked
police car.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewall prefers to listen to satellite radio. On Sunday, an
entire day spent driving across the never-ending dry flatlands of
Texas, she surfs between news, new age and country stations, only
popping on the CB when she sees a sign telling her Interstate 10 is
closed heading into New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to tell why the 10 is closed. On the CB, some truckers
are saying it's a dust storm. Others say it's rain. Still others say
it's a car accident--a 37-car pileup. Accurate information is hard to
come by, but one thing's for sure: No one will be traveling westbound
on the 10 into New Mexico tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewall parks the truck. It is 9:30 p.m. The load she's carrying
is due in Fontana at 7 a.m., and there are still three states to
cross. They won't make it in time, but Rosewall and Thunder aren't
panicked--their load is not perishable, and road closures and traffic
jams come with the territory. They simply rest for a few hours until
the road reopens.</TE>
<TE>   It's about 8 a.m. when they cross the border back into "communist
country," dropping their speed from the 75 mph limit in Arizona to
the 55 mph mandatory maximum in California. Just as there was one
week earlier, on the right there's desert; on the left, even more
desert.</TE>
<TE>   In Fontana--about seven hours after they had hoped to
arrive--Thunder and Rosewall drop their load of air and oil filters
and head to Riverside for the first of five pickups--of grapefruit,
oranges, carrots and lettuce. The load is destined for Jessup, Md.</TE>
<TE>   It will be there in three days.</TE>

<LD>Have you noticed what's been happening to the hamburger?</LD>
<LD>   In a city that has always been obsessed with them at their most
humble--a fact that outsiders can't stop marveling over--hamburgers
are becoming so doted on by chefs, so dolled up with luxury
ingredients, so carefully constructed and served that even in Los
Angeles they're a novelty. Restaurants with fine china and long wine
lists are adding distinctive signature burgers to their menus, and at
prices to make the average In-N-Out fan wince.</LD>
<LD>   Just take the Alex Burger at Alex on Melrose: an over-the-top
handful of hand-chopped dry-aged Angus beef, applewood smoked bacon,
balsamic-glazed shallots and melted Brie. The price: $18.</LD>
<TE>   Or the $16 Viceroy Burger at Whist in Santa Monica: another
hand-chopped Angus affair, but topped with relative restraint with
homemade pickles and whole-grain mustard aioli.</TE>
<TE>   The luxury burgers generally fall into two camps. Some emphasize
premium meat--foie gras, braised short ribs, steak trimmings (making
a burger from trimmings is an old tradition still followed by some
steakhouses, such as Taylor's or Nick and Stef's). Others concentrate
on toppings: farmers market tomatoes, exotic cheeses, marmalade-like
onion relishes and homemade relishes such as ketchup, pickles and
garlicky mayonnaise.</TE>
<TE>   One thing many of them have in common is that the waiter doesn't
ask, "How would you like that cooked?" The chef's conception calls
for a medium-rare burger, or sometimes even rarer than that.</TE>
<TE>   Where did this all begin? Some point East, to Daniel Boulud, the
French-born chef who fatefully introduced the $29 DB burger at DB
Bistro Moderne in Manhattan last summer. It's a 2-inch-thick patty of
ground sirloin filled with boned short ribs, foie gras and black
truffle. The sandwich, which only the foolhardy will try to eat by
hand, created a buzz and now accounts for 25% of the restaurant's
sales.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Boulud's success spurred chefs around the country
to try to emulate him. In Dallas, Paris Vendome has rolled out its
own $16 burger with short ribs and foie gras in it. "A beautiful,
beautiful hamburger," partner Michel Boutemy de Guislain calls it.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact is, the L.A. burgers don't show any direct borrowing,
and we didn't really need any outside inspiration. This is a town
that has always been serious about hamburgers, a place where people
argue about burgers at parties the way Manhattanites argue about
Chinese food.</TE>
<TE>   We've always had some sort of premium burger. Several local burger
chains--Hampton's, Hamburger Hamlet and Cassell's--are based on the
idea of a premium burger. Back in the '80s, a place in Hollywood
called the Nucleus Nuance was making the Evolution Burger from a
judicious mixture of beef knuckle and veal, ground fresh when the
burger was ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the wilting economy seems to be as much a factor in the
burger boom as inspired chefs. Hamburgers, which generally cost
little to make, leave value-conscious diners feeling sated because of
their large size. And for restaurateurs, they carry hefty profit
margins.</TE>
<TE>   But they're the opposite of a cheap, mass-produced burger (and of
a diet-conscious burger too, but let's not even think about that).
They have a chef's personal touch, and they show what professional
skill can do with a simple food. Whether you're relishing a luxurious
piece of meat or sinking into a rich blend of beef and plush topping,
you're having a memorable food experience.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Dobbs, a 43-year-old executive vice president at Picture
Head, a Hollywood post-production company, has been a burger junkie
for as long as he can remember. He gushes with a teenager's
enthusiasm about the burger at Alex.</TE>
<TE>   "The original Tommy's Burger is pretty great, and In-N-Out is
really fresh and tasty, but they don't hold a candle to the Alex
burger," said Dobbs, who drops by Alex about twice a month for his
fix. "It's the best burger I've ever tasted."</TE>
<TE>   For Alex Scrimgeour, owner and chef of Alex, his namesake burgers
have become one of the most popular items on the menu. Made from
steak trimmings, the burgers are "a great way to use up all these
terrific scraps of prime-aged beef we have but don't want to throw
away," he says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   When Chadwick revived its lunch service two months ago, owner
Benjamin Ford and sous chef Andrew Kirschner debated whether burgers
should be on the menu. With its blond and dark woods, amber vases and
reddish silk pillows along the banquette, the Beverly Hills
restaurant hardly looks like a burger joint. And with an average
lunch ticket of $25 per person, it's hardly priced like one.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Chadwick serves a burger. "Customers kept on asking
for one," Kirschner said.</TE>
<TE>   Chadwick's chopped-sirloin burger ($12), a half-pound hamburger
topped with aged Cheddar, grilled red onions and homemade pickles and
served with fries, has struck a chord. The sandwich now accounts for
20% of lunch sales. And next week, the restaurant plans to roll out a
second burger, topped with pickled red onions and Maytag blue cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The 8-ounce, $10.95 hamburger served at Reign in Beverly Hills is
another hit. It's topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion and Dijon
mustard.</TE>
<TE>   At Jar in Los Angeles, chef and owner Suzanne Tracht serves a
burger based on the simplicity principle. Rather than gussy up her
half-pound creation with foie gras or short ribs, she garnishes a
patty of top sirloin with watercress, balsamic red onions and aioli.
"It's a hamburger, for goodness sake," Tracht says.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant regular Bill Beth thinks it's more than that. The
Hancock Park resident and retired investment banker said he considers
Jar's sandwich a bargain, despite its $11 price tag.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem paying for the priceless," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Some people do.</TE>
<TE>   You could order four $2.39 Whoppers and have change left, or
nearly five Big Macs at $2.29 each, for the price of a single Jar
burger. Simply put, many diners don't have the stomach for a burger
costing $11 or more.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just too much money," said Lisa Mamo, a 38-year-old Costa
Mesa resident and FedEx employee. "No way. I would never pay that."</TE>
<TE>   However, a friend recently bought her a $10.95 burger at Cedar
Creek Inn in San Juan Capistrano, which Mamo admits was "the best
damn burger I ever had."</TE>
<TE>   The boom in gourmet hamburgers comes at a time when overall burger
sales are soggy. In 2001, hamburger sales hit nearly $47 billion,
only a 2.7% increase compared to a year earlier. By contrast, the
$269 billion restaurant industry grew 4.5%, according to Technomic
Inc., a restaurant research and consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that going out to lunch meant getting a burger and
fries at a fast-food restaurant," said Richard Martin, managing
editor of Nation's Restaurant News. "Now there are lots of new menu
alternatives out, and lots of different types of restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   Given its humble history, few could have predicted the rise of the
ritzy burger.</TE>
<TE>   The hamburger's roots are found in Hamburg, Germany, where some
sort of pounded beefsteak became popular by the middle of the 19th
century, according to "The Dictionary of American Food and Drink."
Beating the fatty meat made it more tender and palatable.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. towns, including Seymour, Wis., claim to be the
birthplace of the hamburger. But there is little debate that a
"hamburger steak" was featured at the World's Fair in St. Louis in
1904.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, street vendors began selling ground-beef
patties on buns to hungry factory workers, giving the sandwich a
blue-collar edge. Since hamburgers were typically made of
miscellaneous meat scraps, wisecracking lunch counter waitresses
nicknamed them "sweep up the kitchen floor."</TE>
<TE>   White Castle, followed by Wimpy Grills, McDonald's, Burger King
and other chains later made the cheap but tasty sandwiches available
everywhere, says Christopher Muller, a professor of restaurant
management at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until recently, the hamburger was considered a low-brow
product," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, up until recently.</TE>

with the salt. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours. Drain the cucumber
mixture in a colander and let sit 15 minutes. Check to see if a
cucumber tastes too salty; if so, rinse with cold water. Meanwhile,
bring a large pot of water to a boil and sterilize 2 (1-quart) jars
and lids about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, but leave the jars and
lids in the hot water until you're ready to use them. Combine the
peppercorns, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, garlic, cider vinegar and
sugar in a large pot and bring to a boil. Divide the drained cucumber
mixture between the sterilized jars and cover with the hot pickling
liquid, filling to within 1/4 inch of the rim. Cover with the lids
and fasten the rings tight. The pickles are now ready, but they will
only get better over time; store in the refrigerator. 2 quart jars.

<HD>Introducing the Glam Burger</HD>
<DH>The recipe for L.A.'s burger-of-the-moment is a chef's
secret. But the Test Kitchen loves a mystery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've done it. We've broken the code. We know we're going to get mail
disputing this, and chef Sang Yoon may well deny that we've divined
his secret, but we know how to make the Office burger.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the hamburger that has brought fame to a little
Santa Monica joint named Father's Office. It's been widely reviewed
and talked about since Yoon took over the kitchen early last year. In
January, Esquire's Man at His Best column awarded the Office burger
"three fries"--over just 2 1/2 for the truffled, foie gras-infused,
$29 burger served at Daniel Boulud's DB Bistro Moderne in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The home of all this commotion, Father's Office, is a plain,
narrow room with blond-wood paneling. It may serve snacks after 5
p.m., but it's definitely not a restaurant--it's a bar dating from
the '50s. A very busy, noisy bar at that, even on weeknights.</LD>
<TE>   If you want anything to eat, you have to beg a menu from the
bartender. Then you have to communicate your choice, loudly and
distinctly, to somebody behind the bar, pay your $9.75 and wait.
You'd better point out where you're sitting, too, because eventually
somebody will bring your food there.</TE>
<TE>   The bar menu runs to Spanish tapas, but the big draw is clearly
the Office burger. Sometimes Father's Office is sold out of them by
9:45 p.m. Picture that--a place beingsold out of burgers!</TE>
<TE>   Well, it is a terrific burger. Its combination of fresh meat, two
pungent cheeses and a sweet, smoky compote of bacon and browned
onions is overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   We had to know how to make it. So we called and asked for the
recipe. "No, no, no," Yoon replied, muttering something about a
chef's secret. Yoon has never revealed the recipe--not even to
Esquire magazine, he pointed out--and he wasn't about to now.</TE>
<TE>   That was enough for us. The Times Test Kitchen loves a mystery. We
determined to figure it out for ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Yoon had revealed last year that the meat was a mixture of chuck,
sirloin and dry-aged New York steak trim.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that a food processor grinds this combination
perfectly well, and it may mix the meats better than a meat grinder
would.</TE>
<TE>   Nor were the cheeses any secret, or even particularly hard to
find. They're Swiss Gruyere and Maytag blue from Iowa; likewise, the
toasted mini-baguette and the arugula that plays the lettuce role in
this burger.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty was with the bacon-onion compote on the patty. We
got the proper Wisconsin apple-smoked bacon, but when the kitchen
fried the onions (in bacon grease, of course) and added the bacon and
some balsamic vinegar, the result wasn't quite right.</TE>
<TE>   We put in Worcestershire sauce; still not quite there. Some black
pepper. Better, but not smoky enough.</TE>
<TE>   We couldn't put in any more bacon without making the compote too
bacony. On an impulse, we added a drop of liquid smoke, which did the
trick.</TE>
<TE>   The compote was still not quite sweet enough to balance the
sharpness of the blue cheese. The onions had been sauteed golden
brown, but not terribly dark, so the kitchen began to suspect that
not all the sweetness came from onions.</TE>
<TE>   We added some sugar and let it caramelize.</TE>
<TE>   But something was still missing. The compote on a sample Office
burger we brought to our own office was a shade redder than this
compote, and it had a quality that subtly suggested a barbecue sauce.
So we added some ketchup and cooked some more.</TE>
<TE>   Now we only needed to make an oblong patty, fry it and melt two
cheeses on it, set it on toasted roll, spread it with the onion
compote and sprinkle it with arugula.</TE>
<TE>   A crunch between the teeth ... a hit of fresh bread flavor ... an
herbal whiff of arugula ... meat juices spreading in the mouth ...
the pungent tang of blue cheese, followed by a nutty Swiss flavor ...
and finally, the sweet, smoky, rich, tangy flavors of the compote
wrestling with the meat and the sharp cheese right to the final bell.</TE>
<TE>   Now, that's a burger.</TE>
<TE>   We'd done it. In the process, the kitchen literally cooked a
couple of dozen hamburgers. We all tasted burger after burger, and
after work we all passed on supper.</TE>
<TE>   The Test Kitchen staff went home every night and took showers to
get rid of the fine layer of grease that had built up on their hair
and skin.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been this greasy since I worked at McDonald's," said
one.</TE>
<TE>   But it was worth it, because our result was very close, indeed.
And probably even better than that--we think we've nailed it. We're
sure we know Father's little secret: Worcestershire, liquid smoke,
sugar and ketchup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our Office Burger</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 5
minutes</TE>
<TE>   You'll need to cook more bacon than you actually will use to have
enough drippings.</TE>
<TE>   CARAMELIZED ONIONS</TE>
<TE>   4 slices applewood-smoked bacon</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, sliced (about 4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon ketchup</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 drops liquid smoke</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the bacon until crisp, 5
to 6 minutes, then remove to paper towels to drain. Crumble 1 of the
slices and set aside; reserve the rest of the bacon for another use.
Measure 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat into a medium heavy skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Add the onions to the skillet and sprinkle with the sugar. Cook
until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Halfway through,
stir in the crumbled bacon. At the end of the 20 minutes, stir in the
balsamic vinegar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, salt
and pepper. Cook for 2 more minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   BURGERS</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds strip steak (preferably dry-aged), ground</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound rib-eye steak (preferably dry-aged), ground</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce blue cheese</TE>
<TE>   4 ounces Gruyere cheese</TE>
<TE>   4 French demi-baguettes, halved and toasted</TE>
<TE>   1 cup baby arugula</TE>
<TE>   Combine the strip and rib-eye steaks and mix in the salt. Shape
the meat into 4 (7-inch) oval patties, about 3/4 inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet, preferably
cast-iron, over medium-high heat. Fry the burgers, 2 at a time, for 3
minutes, then flip. Top each burger with 1/4 of the blue and Gruyere
cheeses. Cook the burgers 3 more minutes for medium.</TE>
<TE>   Remove and keep warm; melt the remaining butter in the skillet and
repeat with the remaining 2 patties and cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   To assemble, place the burgers on the baguettes and top with the
onions and arugula, dividing evenly.</TE>

<DH>India is in love with its highly spiced pickles, and making
them at home has had a renaissance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUVIR SARAN and STEPHANIE LYNESS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indians love pickles. Vegetarian households invariably serve at least
one pickled dish or relish at every meal. And even when there is meat
on the table, there is usually also a pickle or two, particularly at
special occasions.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the reason is practical: Pickling is a way to preserve
foods without refrigeration in a blistering climate. But there's also
another reason: Indians are greedy for flavor. It's not just that we
love the taste of food--we live for it. We're always hungry for more
layers and more contrasting tastes. And no food can satisfy that
hunger as well as a variety of pickles.</LD>
<LD>   After about 10 years of relying on store-bought pickles, India is
experiencing something of a pickle-making revival. Cooks there are
learning once again to appreciate this cornerstone of the cuisine,
and for the American cook, the revelation will only be more profound.</LD>
<TE>   Indian pickles can add complexity to any kind of meal. They can be
served as appetizers, with crackers and cheese. They make an
intriguing relish with steak. They can be chopped into egg salad, or
served alongside scrambled eggs. A bit of their oil enlivens mashed
potatoes, or mixed with mayonnaise, makes a wonderful sauce for
steamed fish. Think of Indian pickles like a salsa or a chutney--two
other exotic condiments that are now staples of the American pantry.</TE>
<TE>   Indians will pickle almost anything--vegetables, fruits, even
meats. And many of the ingredients are the same as American pickles:
salt, vinegar, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric, cinnamon,
cloves and ginger. But Indian pickles offer some of the most diverse
and exotic tastes and textures imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of our pickles are fiery hot, but they're also sour,
pungent, fragrant, sweet-and-sour and tart. They can be crisp or
chewy or silky-textured. Sometimes the flavors are fresh, the taste
of each spice distinct. Or, if the pickle has been aged, the flavors
will marry and intensify, the textures melt and soften.</TE>
<TE>   Some pickles are made to be eaten in large quantities, the way
you'd eat a vegetable side dish, but most pickles are too strongly
flavored for that. They're eaten in minuscule amounts, just enough to
enliven the taste of a dish. (One of the great advantages of pickles,
in fact, is that they are guaranteed to punch up the taste of the
blandest foods.)</TE>
<TE>   In India, pickles are more than a food. In the summertime, a
town's social life centers on pickle-making. Pickles are the
sustenance for travelers, and a symbol of home. They are eaten as a
cure for ailments such as stomach aches. They are an important part
of the Ayurvedic tradition. There are even literary odes to pickles.</TE>
<TE>   As you would guess, everyone has strong feelings about them. But
if you ask an Indian where the best pickles are made, he will
probably name three sources: the Marwari and Baniya trading
communities in northern India, the state of Gujarat in western India
and the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India.</TE>
<TE>   The Marwari and Baniya communities are completely vegetarian and
subsist on pickles and bread. The people of these communities make
pickles every day, and their meals are made up of several different
types. Pickles that are spiced with fenugreek and fennel and pickled
in mustard oil are likely to be from northern India, as are pickled
cauliflower, carrots, turnips and radishes, the winter vegetables
that are grown on the northern plains.</TE>
<TE>   The very best pickles of that Gujarat region are said to be from
the city of Surat. There is a saying in that area: "Surat nu jaman,
Kashi nu maran," which translates as, "One should go to Surat to
enjoy a meal and then to Kashi [one of the holiest cities in India]
to find peace and die." These pickles are typically made with sesame
and peanut oils.</TE>
<TE>   In Andhra Pradesh, there is an old saying that a good kitchen
should have no fewer than 50 different pickles. South Indian pickles
use a lot of chiles, both whole and powdered, as well as fenugreek
seeds and curry leaves. You'll find tropical berries and herbs
pickled in the south, in peanut, sesame and sometimes coconut oils.
Southern pickles tend to be hotter than those made in other parts of
India.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in New Dehli and the Northern Plains, I remember
pickling season as an incredibly exciting time, something akin to
Christmas for American kids. I couldn't wait to taste the current
year's batch of pickles. For weeks every summer, I would run home
after school every day to find out what had happened to the pickles
while I was gone--if only to watch our family chef, Panditji, shake
and rotate the jars out on the veranda and try to cajole him into
opening one early for a taste.</TE>
<TE>   Pickles represent a ritual world of food and community in India.
Pickling is an ancient art and a part of Hindu spiritual practice.
According to the laws of Hindu religion, pickling--"cooking" foods
with sun and air--is one of the three acceptable ways to make raw
foods palatable. The rituals of pickle-making define a certain period
of the summer when entire households are given over to the task in
India. Play, food, music and storytelling combine to give the season
a celebratory mood.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, in small towns, the women join together, spending
days outside in the shade of tamarind trees cutting, preparing and
drying the fruits and vegetables. The kids play above in the dense
greenery of the trees, eating the green fruit of the tamarind and
tossing the seeds onto the ground below. (Stomach aches and tiny
tamarind seedlings are evidence of their gluttony.)</TE>
<TE>   Below, the women lay the fruit out on terraces on sheets of muslin
for several days to dry, or "ripen," in the summer sun and
concentrate their flavors. The produce is brought inside every night
to protect against dew and laid out again in the morning. Then the
pickles are put up in big ceramic jars about 20 inches tall and set
out to ripen in the sun for several more days.</TE>
<TE>   Even in urban centers in India today, the time of pickling still
invites ritual community and celebration. Women call each other on
the phone to organize the making of the pickles or to ask for the
gift of a jar of a favorite kind. Life slows a bit, personal
connections are made and ritual, thousands of years old, is repeated.</TE>

specializes in Indian cuisine. Stephanie Lyness is a food writer.</TE>

<TE>   Mixed Vegetable Pickle</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes, plus 2 to 3
days standing</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of the more intense-flavored or fiery hot Indian
pickles, you can eat this pickle almost like a vegetable, in
relatively large portions. It goes well with grilled meats and any
Indian dishes. Or, serve simply with pita bread. Don't inhale the
mustard oil as it heats; it burns the nose and eyes somewhat the way
an onion does. You might substitute canola oil for half of the
mustard oil if you prefer a milder tasting pickle. Use a spice
grinder to grind the mustard seeds. Mustard oil, asafetida and brown
mustard seeds are sold at Indian markets.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds peeled and trimmed mixed vegetables such as cauliflower,
turnips, radishes and carrots</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons mustard oil</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon asafetida</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup brown mustard seeds, ground to a powder</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   12 Anaheim or serrano chiles, trimmed and slit lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 2 lemons</TE>
<TE>   Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces: the cauliflower into
florets; the radishes in halves or quarters, depending on their size;
the carrots in half lengthwise and then crosswise into 1-to 1
1/2-inch sections; the turnips into bite-sized wedges. Combine the
vegetables in a large, non-aluminum bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil to smoking in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Remove from the heat and let cool a few minutes. Add the turmeric and
asafetida, swirl the pan to mix and let cool. Add the ground mustard
seeds, salt, cayenne and chiles and pour the cooled oil over the
vegetables. Stir with a wooden spoon to coat the vegetables. Add the
vinegar and lemon juice and stir well. Spoon the vegetables into 2
clean 1-quart jars and set on sunny windowsill or in a warm, dry spot
in the kitchen for 2 to 3 days. Then refrigerate and eat within 3
days.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Chile Pickle</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes, plus 5 days
standing</TE>
<TE>   This is a hot pickle. Try it with Indian dishes, steaks or as a
spark for mashed potatoes. Brown mustard seeds, asafetida and
fenugreek seeds are at Indian markets.</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons brown mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon asafetida</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 pound serrano chiles, washed and dried completely, then stemmed
and thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup light sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 4 to 6 lemons</TE>
<TE>   Combine the mustard seeds, asafetida and fenugreek seeds in a
small skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring often, until very
fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a
powder.</TE>
<TE>   Put the sliced chiles in a large non-aluminum bowl. Add the ground
spices, turmeric and salt and stir to coat the chiles with the
spices. Spoon the mixture into 2 clean pint jars, cap and set aside
at room temperature overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, heat the oil to smoking in a small saucepan over
medium heat. Pour slowly over the chiles in the jars; the chiles will
sizzle and foam. Cap the bottles and set on a sunny windowsill or in
a warm, dry spot in the kitchen for 1 day.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, add enough lemon juice to cover the chiles. Cap the
bottles again and set back on a windowsill or in a warm, dry place
for 3 to 4 more days. Refrigerate and eat within 2 to 3 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   1 quart. Each tablespoon: 18 calories; 283 mg. sodium; 0

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sour Lemon Pickle</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 20
minutes, plus 2 months standing</TE>
<TE>   Indians traditionally eat this pickle with lentils and rice, and a
small piece is often given to soothe an ailing stomach. Carom seeds,
which may be labeled as ajowain, are found in Indian stores, as is
asafetida.</TE>
<TE>   12 lemons, hard stem ends removed</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons black peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cumin seeds</TE>
<TE>   5 cardamom pods</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/2-inch cinnamon stick</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon ground mace</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons carom seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon asafetida</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   9 tablespoons salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 200 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the lemons in half lengthwise and then cut each half
lengthwise into 6 to 8 wedges. Save any juices you get from cutting
the lemons; set aside. Lay the wedges out on 2 paper towel-lined
trays and place in the oven 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Grind the peppercorns, cumin, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon in a
spice grinder to a powder. Transfer to a large bowl and add the
cayenne, mace, nutmeg, carom seeds, red pepper flakes, asafetida,
ginger and salt. Add the reserved lemon juice and mix well. Add the
lemon wedges and mix, pressing the spice mixture onto the flesh of
the lemons.</TE>
<TE>   Pack the lemons into 1 clean (1-quart) jar and 1 clean (1-pint)
jar. Cap the jars and set in a sunny window for 5 weeks, turning the
jars up and down several times, 3 to 4 times a day. Let the pickles
age at least another month before eating. Refrigerate after opening.</TE>

<HD>A New 'Joy' Will Turn Back the Clock</HD>
<DH>America's beloved cookbook is back in the hands of the
author's family, after a glamorous and contentious make-over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Joy of Cooking," one of the bestselling cookbooks of all time,
is being reinvented--again.</LD>
<LD>   It was last revised five years ago in a controversial $5-million
project based on the work of an all-star cast of more than 100 chefs,
writers and recipe developers. This time, the new edition will be a
strictly mom-and-pop operation, pulled together by Ethan Becker, the
grandson of the book's original author, and his wife, Susan.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the book isn't selling well--the 1997 revision has
sold more than 1.5 million copies in five years. But Becker, still
smarting from the way his work had been ignored in the last go-round,
has convinced Simon &amp; Schuster to return "Joy" to its Midwestern
family roots.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're hoping to do is to bring the voice back, the family
voice," says Becker. "I don't want to denigrate any of the work that
was done by the cooking community on the last book, but I don't think
it's quite as usable as some of the previous editions, it's not as
user-friendly. What Susan and I have been saying to each other is
that 'The Joy' is coming home."</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 revision was one of the biggest cookbook stories of the
decade. Working with a budget estimated at $5 million, a hotshot New
York editor marshaled an army of more than 100 chefs, writers and
recipe developers with the goal of creating a new American classic.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the spectacular sales, it seemed almost everyone
involved went away mad, including the editor, who left for another
publisher shortly thereafter. The book itself drew mixed reviews,
with some praising its up-to-date style and others criticizing its
concentration on trendy recipes rather than old favorites.</TE>
<TE>   More substantial criticisms involved the omission of some
important background material--the thing "Joy" had always been known
for. For example, while the '97 revision included instructions for
forming various rustic bread shapes such as baguettes and boules, it
neglected to explain the difference between all-purpose and bread
flour, or how to use various kinds of yeast.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for this new "Joy"--to be released in time for the book's
75th birthday in 2006--are still in a very preliminary stage. The
Beckers say it will be a blend of the 1997 revision and the previous
editions. Like the last edition, it will be published by Simon &amp;
Schuster under its Scribner imprint. Beth Wareham will be the editor,
Ethan Becker says. Wareham, who was the publicist on the '97 book,
declined to comment. Wareham has been an editor for two years and
this is by far the biggest project she's worked on. Because of the
long lead time in book publishing, she has had only one book
released, "Al Roker's Big Bad Book of Barbecue." This fall she has
four "The Joy of Cooking" spinoff books coming out, two of
which--"Canning and Preserving" and "Party Foods and Drinks"-- are
based on material dropped from the '97 edition.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular cookbooks of all time, with more than 15
million copies sold since it was first published in 1931, "The Joy of
Cooking" has been a reliable friend for generations. It's the book
beginners turn to when they want to roast a chicken; it's the place
experienced cooks look for detailed information on such things as
cuts of meat and types of flour.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout the book's history, behind the placid domesticity
of the recipes, "Joy" has roiled with controversy--million-dollar
legal wrangles, rapacious businessmen, troubled inheritances and
enough ill will to curdle milk.</TE>
<TE>   This current revision is the latest in a chain that stretches back
to 1931, when Irma Rombauer, a St. Louis housewife, took half of her
inheritance from her late husband and sunk it into a self-published
cookbook (made up largely of other people's recipes, according to
many; Rombauer herself was not a particularly good cook). The initial
printing of 3,000 copies sold well, but Rombauer wanted more. In
pursuit of that, she went to a major publisher, Bobbs-Merrill.
Unfortunately, her business acumen was not equal to her ambition.
Without the advice of an agent or lawyer, she signed a contract that
assigned the publisher the book's copyright, in effect giving them
full ownership of not only that edition but all future ones as well.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was 60 years of legal wrangling by Rombauer and her
heirs--first her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and then her
grandson, Ethan Becker. In the meantime, the book was revised and
updated roughly every five to 10 years. There were new editions in
1943, 1946, 1951, 1962, 1963 (largely correcting the error-riddled
'62 that had been published without the family's permission) and
1975.</TE>
<TE>   Yet so great was the antagonism between the family and the
publishers that Ethan Becker refused to allow the book to be revised
for more than 20 years after his mother's death in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "The 20 years that the theater was dark was not of my choosing,"
says Becker, adding that he had rewritten the book several times but
couldn't convince the publisher to release any of his versions. "They
wanted to screw the book up and I didn't want them to screw the book
up. It was nothing new, Bobbs-Merrill didn't feel my grandmother
should be trusted with anything, and then my mother faced the same
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he was able to negotiate partial ownership of the
copyright from Simon &amp; Schuster, which had wound up with the rights
as the result of a series of mergers, and he began yet another
revision. Maria Guarnaschelli drew the assignment to edit the book. A
top-flight editor responsible for the cookbook careers of Patricia
Wells, Rose Levy Beranbaum and Rick Bayless, Guarnaschelli has a
well-earned reputation for abrasiveness, as well as editorial
excellence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relentless; I'm passionate," she once said of herself. "When
I believe in something, I'm like a Shiite warrior. That's frightening
to people."</TE>
<TE>   Guarnaschelli took Becker's work and immediately shoved it aside
(she said afterward that his contribution to the '97 "Joy" was
limited to a few recipes). Becker says he didn't even see much of the
book before it was published.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it's no secret that Maria Guarnaschelli alienated,
humiliated and insulted the Beckers to such an extent that everyone
is reeling from the experience still," says Anne Mendelson, author of
"Stand Facing the Stove," a history of "The Joy of Cooking" and an
early participant in the 1997 revision.</TE>
<TE>   While Becker still received author's credit (and the family trust
received $2 million of the advance), Guarnaschelli recruited an
all-star cast of cookbook writers and chefs and assigned them to
write and rewrite one another's work.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much material at the end that entire sections of the
book had to be cut at the last minute, just so it could be published
in one volume rather than two. Much of what was included bore little
or no resemblance to the beloved books so many Americans had learned
to cook from.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are whole chapters of important stuff that just had
to be left out," says Mendelson. "Just today I was trying to look up
some information on yeast. I went to the book, turned to the index,
and there was no entry under yeast. Neither was there any information
on different kinds of flours. The completion of that project was an
unholy mess."</TE>
<TE>   "This was like a production of 'Aida,' " Guarnaschelli said at the
time. "So we got rid of a few elephants--what can I do?"</TE>
<TE>   Today, she insists that the whole controversy was overblown. "The
critics consisted of two groups: those who weren't asked to
contribute and those who were, and though they were paid, their stuff
wasn't used the way they thought it should have been," says
Guarnaschelli, who left Simon &amp; Schuster soon after "Joy's"
publication and now works for the publisher W.W. Norton.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for the most part most people really liked working on it.
All in all, who gets 100% of what they want? There is probably a
small percentage of people who were justifiably upset that their
stuff wasn't used."</TE>
<TE>   As far as its usefulness as a reference, she admits there are
holes in certain areas but says that, overall, she's thrilled with
the book. "I used it just this weekend to find out about Boston butt
or pork shoulder roast," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, she says, is that revisions--both the '97 she
supervised and the one on which the Beckers are now embarking--are
part of what makes "Joy" the institution it has become.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe a lot to Marion Becker and Ethan, who paved the way," she
says. "I think it's terrific that they're doing a new revision.
Marion kept the book alive by redoing it every five years, and I know
it must have been hard at times.</TE>
<TE>   "When people like a book, they don't want anything changed. And
because it hadn't been revised for more than two decades, when Ethan
and I did it, the fans who had embraced it were even more attached."</TE>
<TE>   The new version will follow a completely different process, says
Becker, though much will be retained from the '97 book, including
some of the material that had been dropped at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch from the last book will be retained," says Becker. "There
are a lot of very good recipes in that book. At this point, we have
submitted a synopsis and chapters list, but we're still very much in
the early stages of deciding what goes and what stays. As far as what
the mix between old and new material on a percentage basis will be, I
wouldn't even be able to make a good guess. It's still too early.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are going to be doing is bringing back some of the
chapters that got dropped at last minute. The canning and preserving
chapter got dropped. Wine and beverages got dropped. There's going to
be a lot of that stuff that's come back."</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Becker says, "This time around, we're going to
have a really good working relationship with the publisher."</TE>

<TE>   Loved the article about gin and tonics. Had one for the first time
two nights ago. I remember as a young girl the fragrant scent of my
mom's and dad's gin and tonics as the bubbles from the tonic water
tickled my nose. I followed the writer's every direction and had a
great drink. My only comment was I liked the top better than the
bottom, where it got a bit too strong for me. Do bars generally make
gin and tonics at this strength? Maybe I should have a tonic and
lime?</TE>

<TE>   I find it beyond belief that Julia Child thinks Italian cuisine is
nothing but pasta ("A Day in the Life at 90," Aug. 7). No, she's too
knowledgeable; it must have been a misunderstanding. All she would
have to do is pick up one of Marcella Hazan's books or read a Tuscan
or Ligurian cookbook to see that pasta plays a minor role, if at
all.To say Italian food is pasta is like saying Chinese food is chow
mein. But thanks for the otherwise great article about the doyenne of
good food.</TE>

<LD>Garlic, cilantro and onion could easily overpower the key to this
Mexican-style salad--squid. But the strong flavors actually
complement the squid, which is mild in taste and low in calories.</LD>
<LD>   Squid cooks very quickly--be sure to remove it from the burner and
drain immediately. Cooked squid should be tender and white with
slightly curled edges. Overcooked squid will be tough like rubber and
hard to eat.</LD>
<LD>   Buy cleaned squid at your seafood counter, if possible, since
cleaning squid yourself can be time-consuming.</LD>
<TE>   Toss the warmed squid with the rest of the salad ingredients for
the flavors to blend. Then, enjoy--you'll have the perfect summer
meal.</TE>

<HD>Get Your Figs Now, While They're Ultra-Ripe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dog days of August and September may be an ordeal for humans, but
they are peak season for figs.</LD>
<LD>   Figs require that kind of intense heat to ripen properly. And now,
in farmers markets around the Southland, there are ultra-ripe
specimens that are supremely delicious--but perishable and not
especially pretty.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard for Americans to understand, accustomed as we are to
cosmetically perfect fruit, that the worst-looking figs taste the
best. Firm, smooth-skinned examples, as picked for commercial
shipment, are dry and unpleasantly vegetal. On the other hand, soft
figs with spotted, tattered skins and perhaps a drop of honeyed
liquid oozing from the bottom have marvelously sweet, jam-like pulp.</LD>
<TE>   Most exquisite are the sunburned, slightly shriveled fruits,
partly dried on the tree, which have rich, concentrated, figgy flavor
that all but begs you to eat one after another.</TE>
<TE>   The Adriatic fig is the variety to look for. It is one of the
finest types for eating fresh, though it is more often dried for fig
paste. This is a shame. The fig is small, with thin green skin, and
it has flesh like strawberry jelly and a tinge of acidity that adds
complexity to its flavor. When you find these, buy them and eat them
as they are or sliced over ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Black Mission, the commonest fig at this time, has a distinctive
wild, "foxy" taste. Flattish, yellow-green Calimyrna is large and
lusciously sweet but somewhat bland as a fresh fruit; drying
intensifies its honeyed, nutty flavor. Kadota has similarly mild pulp
but a thicker skin, so it is best eaten peeled.</TE>
<TE>   Even under ideal circumstances--good varieties, grown in prime
areas, in peak season--not every fig in a given batch will achieve
perfection.</TE>
<TE>   Field-packed containers usually contain some unripe fruits; if
left in a warm area, these will soften a bit, but never make great
eating. Another cause of erratic quality is less evident at the
market: In the 100-degree-plus days of a Fresno summer, trees demand
irrigation, but fruits from just-watered orchards may have less
intense flavor. The best strategy is to buy one basket, sample a few
figs, and invest heavily only if some, at least, are heavenly.</TE>
<TE>   Figs, like most fruits, taste best at room temperature, but if you
want to keep ripe ones more than a day, they need to be refrigerated.
It is also wise to cut open or test-nibble each fig before devouring
it, to make sure that it is not infected with mold or sour from
fermentation.</TE>
<TE>   Many farmers market vendors sometimes sell very ripe figs; these
are two of the most likely sources, and some of the markets where
they sell:</TE>

<HD>A Great Burger? Here Are the Secrets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA DEANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meat is the critical part of any hamburger, of course. But after
cooking dozens of hamburgers, the Test Kitchen made a few surprising
discoveries.</LD>
<LD>   The first was, don't start with hamburger.</LD>
<LD>   The best patties, by far, were the result of quickly chopping
chunks of steak in a food processor. Coarsely chopped beef has a
light, fluffy texture, not packed down and dense like packaged ground
beef. We combined 1 1/2 pounds of a lean steak, such as a strip, with
1/2 pound of a fattier rib-eye. The fattier beef makes for a better,
juicier burger. If you want a truly amazing burger, try dry-aged
beef, available at stores such as Gelson's and Bristol Farms, as well
as specialty butchers. The flavor is intensely beefy and rich.</LD>
<TE>   Keep the meat cold in the refrigerator until chopping time. You'll
get a cleaner chop and the fat won't get pasty. Cut the meat into
1-inch cubes and remove any gristle. It's OK if a small amount of fat
remains, since fat adds flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Add the meat to the processor in batches and pulse 10 to 15 times.
Pulsing--the quick starting and stopping of the processor--doesn't
over-process the meat, which can result in a tough burger. When the
meat is correctly processed, it should look almost light and fluffy,
but with a coarse, chopped look. There will be visible pieces of fat.
We found that chopping a half-pound of meat at a time was a good
quantity; we then shaped each processed batch into a patty.</TE>
<TE>   The next trick is in shaping the patties. After the meat is
ground, gently form flat patties with a small indentation in the
center of each. The indentation ensures that you'll have evenly thick
burgers after cooking rather than patties that bulge in the center.</TE>
<TE>   Our other discovery was in the cooking method. You might guess
that grilling would give you the most deliciously charred results.
But that wasn't the case. We used a cast-iron skillet and some butter
and got a wonderful, evenly browned crust--with no crumbling. We
added 1 tablespoon of butter to a preheated skillet, then cooked the
burgers two at a time over medium-high heat. For medium burgers, cook
them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side; for well-done, 3 1/2 to 4 minutes
per side. The chopped burgers cooked a little more quickly than those
made from ground beef.</TE>
<TE>   Restrain yourself, if you can, from fiddling with the burgers as
they cook. Frequent turning and pressing down on them make for tough,
dry burgers.</TE>
<TE>   Once we had our perfect burgers, we encountered our final
conundrum: to salt before or after? Some of our tasters preferred to
mix salt into the meat just after grinding for a more even flavor;
others preferred to salt their burgers as they cooked in the skillet.
Which is better? Whichever tastes best to you.</TE>

<LD>Couscous is usually prepared by adding boiling water, but in this
main-dish salad, you can skip that step. I found that combining
couscous with cool or tepid water achieves better results.</LD>
<LD>   The couscous needs to stand a little longer--between 15 and 20
minutes, compared with just a few minutes when using hot water. But
the grains will separate and be firm, not clumped or soggy, the
perfect texture for a refreshing salad.</LD>
<LD>   For protein, I've added tofu, which blends in subtly with the
other ingredients. Be sure to drain it before using.</LD>
<TE>   Serve this with iced tea and wedges of soft pita bread with plain
yogurt for dipping.</TE>

<TE>   Herbed Couscous Salad With Apricots</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   2 cups couscous, preferably whole-wheat</TE>
<TE>   2 cups cool or tepid water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons rice vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons curry powder</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   4 green onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shelled pistachios, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   6 apricots, halved and pitted, then cut into bite-sized pieces</TE>
<TE>   8 ounces firm tofu, drained, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Place the couscous in a large bowl. Add the water and 1 tablespoon
of olive oil, stir once, cover and let sit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, pour the balsamic and rice vinegars into a small bowl
and slowly drizzle in the 1/2 cup of olive oil, whisking constantly.
Whisk in the curry powder. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Once the couscous has been rehydrated, about 16 to 18 minutes,
fluff with a fork and add the dressing. Add the cilantro, basil,
green onions and most of the pistachios, reserving a few for garnish.
Add the apricots and mix well but gently so as not to crush them.
Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Gently stir in the tofu.
Drizzle the salad with the lime juice to taste. Garnish with the
reserved pistachios.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I had a recipe for a wonderful Wesson Oil chiffon cake that
I cut out of Ladies' Home Journal in 1950. Somehow I lost this
treasure. Thank you for any help you can give.</LD>
<LD>   ELSIE PENZIN</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica</LD>
<TE>   DEAR ELSIE: Chiffon cakes are light and feathery, and use oil
instead of butter or shortening for their delicate texture. This is
the only chiffon cake I could find that specifically calls for Wesson
Oil (though you can use any vegetable oil). It comes from a Web site,
holidaycooking.hypermart.net and is considered a Christmas
recipe--but good anytime. The frosting is from "The Doubleday
Cookbook," (Doubleday, 1990).</TE>

<TE>   White Christmas Chiffon Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 50
minutes</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sifted flour</TE>
<TE>   3 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup Wesson oil</TE>
<TE>   7 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup cold water</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   7 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup shredded, unsweetened coconut</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Set aside an ungreased 10-inch tube
pan.</TE>
<TE>   Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt together into a
bowl. Make a well and add the oil, egg yolks, water and vanilla and
almond extracts. Beat with a spoon until smooth, or mix with an
electric mixer on medium speed, 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl and beat with
an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Do not
under-beat. Gradually pour the yolk mixture over the beaten whites,
folding just until blended. Do not stir. Fold in the coconut. Pour
the batter into the pan.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cake 55 minutes, then increase the temperature to 350
degrees and bake until the cake springs back when touched, 10 to 15
minutes. Turn the pan upside down and place over the neck of a funnel
or bottle to cool.</TE>
<TE>   WHITE MOUNTAIN FROSTING</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup water</TE>
<TE>   3 egg whites, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a small heavy saucepan.
Insert a candy thermometer and partly cover the pan. Bring to a boil
over medium heat. Remove the lid and boil without stirring until a
drop on the tip of a spoon will spin a 6-to 8-inch thread, or the
thermometer registers 240 to 242 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the syrup reaches the proper temperature, beat the egg
whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.
When the syrup reaches the correct temperature, set the mixer at high
speed and pour the syrup into the whites in a slow thin stream. Beat
until glossy and firm enough to hold their shape, 3 to 4 minutes.
Beat in the vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups flake sweetened coconut</TE>
<TE>   Loosen the sides of the cake from the pan with a spatula and
remove from the pan. Cut the cake in half using a serrated knife to
make 2 layers. Fill the cake with about 1/4 of the frosting, then
replace the top layer. Frost the top and sides with the remaining
frosting. Sprinkle generously with the coconut.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: About five or six years ago you printed a recipe for
Lawry's Coconut Pie. It had a coconut crust and was to die for.</LD>
<LD>   JAN CRUSER</LD>
<LD>   Evansville, IN</LD>
<TE>   DEAR JAN: This is a great pie for those who fail at making pie
crusts. This crust is really simple, consisting of melted butter and
coconut pressed into a pie plate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lawry's Coconut Banana Cream Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes
plus 2 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   COCONUT PIE SHELL</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, plus more for pie plate</TE>
<TE>   3 cups sweetened flake coconut</TE>
<TE>   Lightly butter a 9-inch pie plate and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat and
brown the coconut flakes, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. They
should be golden brown. Press the coconut firmly and evenly in the
pan to form a shell. Chill the crust 30 minutes before filling.</TE>
<TE>   PIE FILLING</TE>
<TE>   4 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   3 cups half-and-half, divided</TE>
<TE>   Yellow food coloring</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 bananas</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   Combine the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch, salt
and flour in a small bowl. Gradually add 1 cup of the half-and-half.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the remaining 2 cups half-and-half and 1/2 cup of the
sugar in a 3-quart saucepan and bring just to boil over medium heat.
Add the egg mixture and cook and stir until the mixture returns to a
boil and thickens, about 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat. Stir in 2 drops of food coloring and the
vanilla. Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from
forming. Let cool.</TE>
<TE>   Slice the bananas into the pie shell. Pour the filling into the
shell.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the cream with the powdered sugar until stiff. Spoon in
dollops or pipe with a pastry bag around the edge of the pie. Chill 2
hours before slicing.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Scherrer is one of California's most eccentric winemakers. Many
of the dozen or so fine, expressive wines he produces under his small
Scherrer Vineyards label in Sonoma County have evocative names like
Little Sister, Big Brother, Madrona Moon and Diaphanous.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a gimmick. Scherrer's wines, like the lean, long-haired
winemaker himself, have intense, distinctive personalities.</LD>
<LD>   Funny thing, though--while his peers consider the veteran of
several top North Coast cellars a winemaker's winemaker, he hardly
seems interested in winemaking at all. In fact, he quickly turns a
discussion about winemaking away from technology, toward the realm of
the senses.</LD>
<TE>   For example, he's currently working with two lots of 2002 Pinot
Noir he calls Yin and Yang. They come from a single vineyard--a new
planting literally on the Sonoma County coast, with a view of
breaking waves--yet they couldn't be more different.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yin is more aromatic," he says. "It seems more of the air.
The Yang is definitely a more grounded wine, more of the earth. I'm
still not sure I'll bottle them with those names, but that's how I
think of them now."</TE>
<TE>   Scherrer made his first wine, from his family's Alexander Valley
vineyard, while he was still in high school. After obtaining a
fermentation science degree from UC Davis in 1979, he went to work at
Fieldstone Winery. At Greenwood Ridge Vineyards in the 1980s, he was
praised for such wines as the Scherrer Vineyard-designated Zinfandels
made from his family's oldest vines, planted in 1912.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Pinot Noir and Zinfandel specialist Dehlinger Winery
in 1988, and with owner Tom Dehlinger's encouragement bottled his
first Scherrer Vineyards wine, a Zin from his family's ranch, in '91.
But it wasn't until '98 that he was able to expand his production of
small-volume bottlings enough to finance his own winery. Current
production is about 6,000 cases, half of them (including the most
interesting small-lot bottlings) going to an avid mailing list. The
wines range in price from $16 to $45.</TE>
<TE>   Scherrer is aware that he doesn't fit the image of the California
winemaker as a master of technology. "When I started out, I felt that
if you're really in control you have to act," he says. "After all, we
call it winemaking, so you have to do things to the wine. But I had
to learn to let go of that and trust the wine to evolve in its own
way."</TE>
<TE>   The winery occupies a cave-like space in an old apple warehouse
near Sebastopol. It's filled with a combination of expensive
equipment and self-designed, homemade and jerry-rigged devices like a
plywood table/chute for sorting grapes on their way to the press, a
makeshift cold chamber for barrel-fermenting Chardonnay. Scherrer is
a trained scientist, yet he relies more on taste and intuition than
computers or high-tech instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only deal with so much information," he says. "I'd rather
concentrate on sensory stuff. Peasant logic will always win out."</TE>
<TE>   He's particularly tuned in to the personalities of different
wines. That's exemplified by two '99 Pinot Noirs labeled Little
Sister and Big Brother. They come from the same Russian River Valley
vineyard, yet they are strikingly different. Scherrer's original
intent was to blend them into one cuvee, but when blending time came,
he couldn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "They fought together in the blend, and I realized they had two
different destinies," he explained. "One was bright and perky,
honest, in your face, like a little sister. The other was dark and
brooding, wearing shades, trying to be cool--just like a big
brother."</TE>
<TE>   He seems particularly interested in that kind of duality. Since
the '96 vintage, he has been bottling two Zinfandels from distinctly
different parts of his family's estate: the Shale Terrace and the Old
and Mature Vines. Tasting all the wines together in early August, I
found two consistently different expressions. The wines from
20-year-old vines growing in shale soil are high-toned and pretty,
lively to the point of aggressiveness, with bright red fruit. The
wines from older vines growing in clay soil are broader, more solid
and muscular, with a kind of quiet strength through the palate.</TE>
<TE>   The '97s show the differences perfectly. The Old and Mature Vines
is heroic in scale, with a fine weight and feline grace on the
palate. The Shale Terrace is a racier wine, equally concentrated but
in the higher register.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Scherrer will see that dual identity in one wine. He
delights in observing the often dramatic evolution of a cuvee between
fermentation and bottling, especially when it's dramatic. That
happened with his '99 Pinot Noir from Block 8 of the Hirsch Vineyard,
he says. "The wine absolutely imploded during fermentation. The color
and flavor disappeared! But then they came back in a different
manifestation, and developed beautifully."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the wine is a deep, radiant garnet, wonderfully aromatic,
and packed with brilliant flavors. Its high-toned, ethereal quality
moved him to label the wine Diaphanous.</TE>
<TE>   Clonal mixes interest him too. "When you build a human body,
you've got flesh and bone, soft things and hard things. When you
build a wine from different clones, you find elements that harmonize
when you put them together--from black cherry and red cherry to
mystery and earth."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Scherrer was invited to present his wines alongside
other top Pinot producers from around the world at the International
Pinot Noir Conference in Oregon. One of the speakers was a Burgundy
winemaker who went off on a metaphysical tangent.</TE>
<TE>   "He was talking like an alchemist, describing how the grapes go
through this metamorphosis in the winery that's like combustion,"
Scherrer says. "Yet the essence of the fruit remembers where it came
from, the characteristics it developed in response to the
environment. And those are consistent in wine from certain places."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the audience had trouble grasping that concept, says
Scherrer, but he understood his colleague perfectly. "You put these
grapes in a tank and they fizz," he says. "It is like combustion. And
they do change into something else--a wine that has the specific
character of its origin. Imagine how people viewed this stuff before
we had a scientific viewpoint. It is a wondrous process. There is
something magical about it."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though this is only his third vintage, 30-year-old Mark Trevisan has
made one of the most lively and elegant New World Rhones I've tasted
in a while. His blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre (slightly
weighted to the Syrah) is mouth-filling and intense, but the luscious
ripe fruit never crosses the line into jammy territory. It will
probably improve with age, but why wait?</LD>
<LD>   Linne Calodo, in Paso Robles, is a winery to watch. If you're
wondering, its name does not refer to the owner--it's a type of soil,
namely, calcareous limestone.</LD>
<LD>   About $34. The 2000 LC Red was released only in mid-June, yet some
stores are already sold out. Available at John &amp; Pete's Fine Wine &amp;
Liquor in West Hollywood, (310) 657-3080; Wally's in West Los
Angeles, (310) 475-0606; Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454.
Call the winery for other stores, (805) 227-0797.</LD>

<LD>Hetch Hetchy Valley--An editorial in Saturday's Times incorrectly
said the bill authorizing construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam in
Yosemite National Park was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in
1913. The legislation was signed by President Woodrow Wilson. In
1908, Roosevelt's secretary of the Interior issued a permit for the
project, but opponents blocked work until Congress approved
construction.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We loved your act--would you consider doing a show at a prison?"</LD>
<LD>   Deborah Tobola from the Arts in Corrections Department at the
California state prison in San Luis Obispo had just seen my set at
the Improv in Hollywood. "Nine shows, 45 to 50 minutes long, in two
days."</LD>
<LD>   I was going to have to think long and hard about this one.</LD>
<TE>   "We will pay you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" I replied, and so began my journey.</TE>
<TE>   The prison--California Men's Colony--was to become, as of July 1,
a nonsmoking environment. So Tobola's department thought a comedy
show might reduce the nicotine withdrawal tension the inmates were
experiencing.</TE>
<TE>   All my material was to be reviewed and censored: No swearing, no
drug talk, avoid talking about sex and race, yet keep it funny enough
to make angry convicted felons laugh.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I had to come up with some killer material (no pun
intended) to avoid being killed. So I kept some of the drug-related
gags and attached an "anti-drug" message to get by the censors. But I
knew I'd have to use the terms and events of their everyday life
because the driving force behind comedy is life--being human, being
angry and afraid and understanding that these are all shared
circumstances. So I decided to drive there and meet with some of the
inmates and get a feel for their lives, what they talk like and
about.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll be doing the shows out in the prison yards," Tobola told
me when I asked to see the room I'd be performing in. Generally, I
like to be elevated so the crowd can see me, and with a projected
turnout of several hundred, well, there was no way I could do my act
on level ground, let alone with a mob around me--particularly one
serving a life sentence for murdering a truck driver with their bare
hands.</TE>
<TE>   And take it from me: There really is not a "good" place to perform
a stand-up comedy act in a prison yard, I don't care what Cosmo tells
you. I decided on the top of a picnic table.</TE>
<TE>   Next I sat in a room alone with eight inmates and talked about
prison life. In place of money, they said, "Here at the CMC we trade
in soup."</TE>
<TE>   A soup-based economy. That's the kind of material I was looking
for. Two of the inmates started to argue about giving me too much
inside information. I looked at the emergency alarm button on my
belt. By the time the guards came in, it really wouldn't be an alarm
button so much as a come-pick-up-my-dead-body button. I wasn't even
sure who was supposed to push the button--me, or them after they beat
me up.</TE>
<TE>   The first show of the day was at 9:30 a.m. Just before I went on,
Tobola said, "If the prison alarm sounds, all the inmates will have
to lie on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   "Then I could say I had them rolling on the ground." Always combat
fear with comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Tobola gave my intro and I jumped up onto the picnic table and the
shows began. My opener was: "I have to say I'm a bit surprised to be
here. My manager told me I'd be performing on an open-air stage in a
gated community near the ocean, with lots of bars and a captive
audience. She knows how to stretch the truth. I did start to get
suspicious though when she told me I was going to be paid in soup."</TE>
<TE>   To my relief, the response was laughter. My biggest fear had been
if the first show went terribly, I would have eight more shows to go,
each more terrifying than the last. But that fear was gone--the first
show was a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates hung around after the show to tell me how much they
appreciated my coming. One guy even tried to give me a packet of
soup. Another asked me to tell the guards to stop sending subliminal
messages through the P.A. system. He was a hit when I told that story
two shows later.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I had to use the subject that was on all their minds:
cigarettes. As I told this joke, I held up two packs of cigarettes
(empty of course) wrapped in white paper with "T-shirts" written on
them.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend of mine said, 'You know what you should do Bill? Smuggle
in some cigarettes. And sell them.' I said, 'No way, I can't do that.
That's illegal. I'd get in trouble.' ... But I will be selling these
nicely packaged T-shirts after the show.... They come in two sizes,
regular and menthol."</TE>
<TE>   Then I faced my second-biggest fear: inmate hecklers.</TE>
<TE>   What do you say to a heckler who's killed 10 people? A safe
response I came up with was, "If you don't like the show, write up a
602." A 602 is a complaint form for inmates and that joke got big
laughs every time.</TE>
<TE>   The last show was the 8 p.m. show in "A" quad. It had a lot of
lifers, and the guards told me there was a rumor that "A" yard might
"go off." Going off means gangs will start fighting and stabbing each
other and pandemonium will ensue. The worry was inmates grouping
together for the show might cause them to go off. Others speculated
that maybe they would want to see a funny comedy show, and if it
indeed was funny, they might wait for it to end and then go off, or
perhaps they would go off just for the heck of it.</TE>
<TE>   "If this happens, just back against the wall and don't run," the
guard told me. Apparently lifers are like the T. rex: They can only
see you if you're moving. "Great," I thought, "if I'm not funny I'll
cause a riot and get killed."</TE>
<TE>   What happened was a mixed reaction: Some heckled and walked away
before the show even began; others stayed, others stayed and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the guys who left did so because they feared the hope comedy
can inspire. The guys who stayed and laughed were the ones who could
still embrace it. Laughter is a motivating force and brings hope, and
for some inside, hope is a frightening and soul-shaking thing.</TE>
<TE>   As I worked my way to the yards with the inmates facing less time,
the laughs increased in size and volume. I had some of the best and
worst shows of my life in those two days, and I learned that what
feeds the soul is not soup but hope. Hope and laughter.</TE>

<HD>Brubeck Greets Surprise Guests</HD>
<DH>His son, an emergency fill-in, and the Russian National
Orchestra are a good fit with the jazzman.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Brubeck finally made it into town with his quartet--most of it,
that is.</LD>
<LD>   In September, when the other players in his group became mired in
the airline delays after the events of Sept. 11, he performed at
Pepperdine with a pickup ensemble. On Monday night at the Cerritos
Center for the Performing Arts, Brubeck's personnel was again short a
regular member; bassist Michael Moore was called away by a family
emergency.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, a fine substitute was available, one who is
thoroughly familiar with the music: Brubeck's son Chris. And, because
the younger Brubeck plays bass and trombone, the set was actually
enhanced on one of the numbers by the added horn.</LD>
<TE>   The performance included an additional augmentation unannounced in
advance, for contractual reasons, by the center: the presence of the
Russian National Orchestra. Brubeck and the orchestra have performed
together on a number of occasions, and the familiarity was obvious,
especially in the well-integrated fashion in which the Russians,
conducted by Russell Gloyd, accompanied such traditional quartet
numbers as "Blue Rondo a la Turk" and the classic "Take Five."</TE>
<TE>   The work of this particular Brubeck group is enhanced by the
presence of alto saxophonist Bobby Militello, the stylistic opposite
of Brubeck's longtime companion, the late Paul Desmond.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the latter's cool, floating style, Militello hits hard, his
brawny sound and fleet-fingered lines a direct descendant of Charlie
Parker-through-Phil Woods. On "Take Five," for example, he charged
through a solo that whipped in and out of the 5/4 meter, handling its
offbeat rhythms with consummate ease. And on a final romp through
"Take the 'A' Train," Militello played with such an explosive
rhythmic drive that even the relatively staid members of the
orchestra were tapping their feet and nodding their heads
appreciatively.</TE>
<TE>   Brubeck's pianistic offerings were somewhat more modest. Seemingly
drawn toward earlier styles these days, he frequently moved from his
familiar, bombastic chording into piquant stride piano passages. More
compelling were his compositional contributions, especially a
touching work for strings and piano titled "Regret," filled with
flowing harmonies reminiscent in its subtle simplicity, if not its
form, of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian National Orchestra, opening the bill under the baton
of Carlo Ponti Jr., offered a briskly spirited rendering of
Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italien and a pops concert-style arrangement
of Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," featuring trumpeter Timofei
Dokshitzer.</TE>

<HD>Radio Sawa's Bad News to Many Young Arabs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANA ELIAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT</DL>
<LD>Young Arabs tuning in to a new American government radio station
designed especially for them rave about its international
playlist--but many are not happy with its news reports. They see it
as propaganda.</LD>
<LD>   In targeting the 30-and-under crowd who make up 60% of the Arab
world's 280 million people, Radio Sawa has ditched the news and
public-affairs focus of the Voice of America Arabic-language service
it replaced. Its music-heavy programming resembles a youth-oriented
station in the United States--only without the commercials.</LD>
<LD>   While a U.S. pop station uses music to draw an audience for ads
for consumer goods, Radio Sawa--"Radio Together" in Arabic--makes no
qualms about using music to connect with Arab listeners in an effort
to show how and what Americans think. It began broadcasting from
Kuwait, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in late March and is
looking to grow by transmitting from more countries in the Middle
East.</LD>
<TE>   The United States is largely seen in this region as a supporter of
Israel against Palestinians. Many here also believe the war on
terrorism is directed at their religion, Islam, not just at Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaida organization. If Radio Sawa wants to dispel those
notions, it will have to break through a barrier of skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to listen to it, but stopped once I found it was American
radio," said Yousef, a 30-year-old Palestinian who lives in the
United Arab Emirates. "They are trying to improve their image and
introduce themselves in a different way, through music instead of
politics. I know them, and I still don't like them."</TE>
<TE>   For news, Yousef, who refused to give his full name, said he
watches Qatar's Al-Jazeera television and Saudi Arabia's Middle East
Broadcasting Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Buthaina Jad'on, a schoolteacher in Jordan's capital of Amman,
said she was shocked when Sawa interrupted its programming recently
for a broadcast of a speech by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like its political news because they are biased to
America and show the Arabs in a different and wrong image," the
27-year-old said. "I listen to its music only and turn it off when
the news begins."</TE>
<TE>   Norman Pattiz, the primary inspiration behind the station, said
Americans, in turn, believe Arab media skew the news. Although
mending that was not the station's primary goal, Sawa "may counter
some of the perceptions" that regional media create about America, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz, founder of the Westwood One radio network in the United
States, scoffed at charges that Sawa airs U.S. propaganda. "We
wouldn't know how to do propaganda if we were asked to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with songs by top international and Arab stars like Brian
Adams, Lebanon's Pascal Mishalani, Britney Spears and Egypt's Hisham
Abbas, the 24-hour station broadcasts public-service messages against
drugs and drinking-and-driving.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa typically devotes about 15 minutes of every hour to news,
with shows at a quarter past and quarter of the hour.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to occasional speeches by top U.S. officials, the
station offers interviews with them. An Arabic translation of the
Bush speech that angered listener Jad'on was broadcast 15 minutes
after the president made it in Washington. In June, Sawa had a
lengthy chat with Secretary of State Colin Powell, with Arabic
translation played over Powell's explanation in English of the Bush
administration's Middle East peace strategies. The station also has a
daily roundup of news about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa has no firm statistics yet on the size of its audience.</TE>

<HD>Performance Fetes Krishna's Birthday</HD>
<DH>When Ramaa Bharadvaj performs 'Yatra--A Journey to India,'
even the sky over Los Angeles adds to the night's beauty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lord Krishna's birthday, on Aug. 30, is a date that might not be
marked on every Southland calendar, but when Ramaa Bharadvaj starts
dancing about it, it becomes a celebration that even the uninitiated
can enjoy. In "Yatra--A Journey to India," a program shared with
singer Mala Ganguly and the Ragamala Music Ensemble at California
Plaza on Sunday night, Bharadvaj's own Angahara Ensemble whipped up
an atmosphere that was as festive as it was aesthetically
crystalline.</LD>
<LD>   The marriage of brisk, geometrical, brightly costumed Indian
classical dance with the plaza's pools, waterfalls and night sky was
fortuitous, starting with "Swagatam Krishna," a swiftly precise
invocational dance in the style of bharata natyam, the classical
dance of southern India. For each dance, Bharadvaj took the role of
Radha, and her daughter, Swetha, that of Krishna, each bringing to
their duets beautiful lines, clear shapes and vivid mime. "Tarangam"
was performed in the kuchipudi style, a related classical form known
best for its trick of doing rhythmic footwork at the edges of a brass
platter. "Prema Geetam" brought the Ragamala Ensemble, who had
started the evening, back to the stage (replacing recorded music for
the previous two dances). It told a tale of lost and found
jewelry--or lost and found love, perhaps--most picturesquely, showing
once again the charm and skill of the Bharadvaj duo.</LD>
<TE>   Ganguly's singing added much to the last dance, and in the first
half of the evening, it could be enjoyed fully, accompanied by the
ensemble: David Trassof (sarod), Paul Livingstone (sitar), David
Philipson (flute) and Ramesh Kumar (tabla). At times, Ganguly's voice
seemed like a band of velvet stretching into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing at intervals was narrator Seth Silvernail, who read
translated lyrics and, at one point, explained Krishna's mime as it
was demonstrated by Swetha Bharadvaj.</TE>

<HD>Leave the Guys Back on the Beach</HD>
<DH>The best moments in 'Blue Crush,' a film about independent
young female surfers, are those about the girls' friendships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONA GABLE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time I surfed I was 14. It was in San Diego, on my youngest
brother's board, and I was the only girl out there in the dark,
choppy waves. I was not exactly surfing legend Lisa Andersen. I fell
off a lot, lost the board almost constantly, drank gallons of
saltwater. My brother pretended he didn't know me. Still, I loved
every exhausting, exhilarating second of it. I also rarely surfed
again.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't a matter of desire or ability. At 5-foot-3, I had the
body of a small quarterback. Like my three older brothers who surfed,
I loved the ocean, and had been body surfing since I could duck under
the waves and hold my breath. The only thing inhibiting me was
something I had no control over: my sex.</LD>
<TE>   Girls, it was clear, did not surf. They sat on the beach watching
guys perfect their cutbacks. The few girls I knew who broke this
rigid cultural taboo got trashed. Surfing meant adventure and
freedom. "Goin' surfing," my brothers would say laconically, as if
that gave my parents any clue as to where they'd be. They could have
been in Costa Rica for all we knew. When my brother Jim sped off in
our Plymouth station wagon, his friends Greg and Tommy hanging out
the windows, their nicked, heavy boards strapped on top, I knew I was
losing out on a formative experience. Although I am a few decades
older than when I stood on the sand at Ocean Beach, a teenage girl in
a Hawaiian print bikini, surfing has never lost its allure for me.</TE>
<TE>   So when I heard there was a movie about surfer girls coming out--a
movie brought to the screen by avid surfer Brian Grazer--I felt this
irrational urge to run outside and shout: "Surf's up!" But the film,
which opened Fridayturns out to be like a great wave you couldn't
quite catch--it's a missed opportunity. While there is much to cheer
in the arrival, at last, of a film that centers on young female
athletes, particularly in a sport where women are incredulously still
viewed as blathering sex objects, "Blue Crush" has one glaring flaw:
It doesn't know what it wants to be. Like its heroines, Anne Marie,
Lena and Eden, who cruise from one surf break to the next in a
banged-up old Chevy, "Blue Crush" has a meandering, drifty quality
that undercuts its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Is it a coming-of-age story about a young woman's struggle for
identity in a macho world? A lush visual poem to a dangerous sport? A
girl buddy movie with a feminist edge? Or--listen up, dudes--a chance
to see some really hot chicks in really tiny bikinis (as those
billboards everywhere suggest)? Or is it a slick, $25-million
commercial for Billabong, whose clothes are paraded continually in
the film and, like a leash to a wayward surfboard, tethered to the
movie's end?</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk about "chick flicks"--a term that makes me
cringe--there aren't a lot of great movies about females this age. I
was trying to think of the last good one I saw. Other than the
light-hearted "Legally Blonde" and the haunting "Boys Don't Cry,"
which don't really turn on female relationships, I had to go back 20
years to a story about another tough young woman athlete, Robert
Towne's "Personal Best."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike so many cultural images of female friendship, which cast
girls as giggly bimbos or vindictive competitors, "Blue Crush"
portrays young women in a sweet, genuine way. I loved the
relationship of the female characters. When Anne Marie and her
friends are teaching a bunch of big goofy football players to surf,
laughing and hooting and having fun, it feels the way girls really
act around each other.</TE>
<TE>   When they help her train for a surf contest, swimming behind her
in the sea-green water as she jogs on the ocean floor carrying a
heavy stone, an exercise real big-wave surfers do to prolong the time
they can hold their breath, it feels right too. The girls not only
depend on each other to survive in a macho sport, but to put food on
the table and cobble together the rent on their leaky shack. When
Anne Marie is abruptly fired, her indignant friends threaten to quit
too.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Blue Crush" is a young person's film (nearly everyone in
it is under age 25), it might resonate with baby boomers, too.
Watching the movie, I couldn't help but be cast back to when I was 18
and sublimely carefree, living near the beach in a tiny apartment
with my friends Theresa and Sue. Guys were important, but they
weren't the focus of our lives--we were. You can't fake that kind of
experience. And "Blue Crush," with its affectionate portrait of
female friendship, doesn't. So why the dopey love interest? Our
plucky heroine becomes smitten with an NFL quarterback and turns to
him to make a crucial decision. Why does she need Mr. GQ? I thought,
disgusted. And where did Lena and Eden suddenly go? Did they get
chewed up out there on the razor-sharp reef? Fly to L.A. for the
movie premiere? Or could it be this jock's opinion is worth more than
theirs?</TE>
<TE>   In a movie supposedly about female empowerment and girls taking
risks, I felt cheated. Except for a bleached blond and rail-thin Kate
Bosworth, the actresses do look like surfers (although not nearly as
buff as the professional surfers who do cameos in the film). Michelle
Rodriguez, with her untamed dark hair, constant scowl and muscular
arms, is positively fierce. Sanoe Lake, who is part Hawaiian and
Japanese, actually grew up surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I really policed, I made sure these girls--not only
could they surf, but their bodies looked like they could surf,"
Grazer said.</TE>
<TE>   He has a daughter who's 14. When I asked what he hoped she would
take away from the film, he said, "I guess, if you have a desire to
do anything, even if it's a sport, you should follow it. And that
will give you the confidence to excel at other things."</TE>
<TE>   Girls may well be inspired by "Blue Crush." There's stunning
footage of female pros Kate Skarratt and Keala Kennelly riding some
of scariest, most beautiful waves on earth. When Kennelly roared down
the face of a skyscraper-sized wave, disappearing inside a massive
wall of foam and then shooting out the other end--still standing--I
gasped.</TE>
<TE>   And although big-wave rider Rochelle Ballard apparently did all
the surfing for Bosworth, well, of course! Would you expect Matt
Damon to surf like Kelly Slater if it were a guys' surf flick?</TE>
<TE>   For girls like my 9-year-old daughter, who pops up on her body
board now in anticipation of the day she surfs, who could benefit
from more films with strong female characters to counter the
relentless tide of cultural dreck, "Blue Crush" is worth the price of
admission.</TE>
<TE>   But next time you want to make a movie about independent young
women, leave the guys on the beach.</TE>

<HD>A Sampling of Smooth Styles at Bowl</HD>

<LD>The variety of pop-oriented music usually identified as "smooth jazz"
actually far exceeds the boundaries of that too-limited label. And
the annual JVC Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl almost always
provides an opportunity to experience a few of the music's many
directions.</LD>
<LD>   With only three acts on the bill for Sunday night's concert, the
number of choices was limited. But the evening's lengthy program
still offered a broad range of colorful musical styles and
stimulating rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   Tenor saxophonist Steve Cole, in the opening spot, played a set
that remained comfortably within the instrumental pop arena pioneered
by Kenny G. But Cole, despite constantly striding from one side of
the stage to the other, lacked G's performing charisma, as well as
his capacity to come up with engaging musical material. As a result,
his program served primarily as dinner music for the crowd, many of
whom were still arriving well past the unusually early 6 p.m. start
time.</LD>
<TE>   The veteran group Fourplay is currently celebrating its 10th
anniversary. Although the quartet's orientation shifted somewhat a
few years ago when guitarist Larry Carlton replaced original member
Lee Ritenour, the goals remain the same: bring a taste of mainstream
swing and improvisational inventiveness to accessible, instrumental
pop jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrating primarily upon music from the just-released album,
"Heartfelt," its first on RCA, Fourplay's versatility was on full
display. Pianist Bob James frequently brought his solos vividly to
life via the insertion of crisp bebop phrases; Nathan East matched
his sturdy bass work with some lighthearted scat singing; and drummer
Harvey Mason illustrated, as he so often has done, his skill at
bringing character and diversity to hard-driving funk rhythms.
Topping off a set with a number that had the large audience
enthusiastically waving handkerchiefs, Carlton, in a solo showcase
number, played the blues with an imaginative skill reaching well
beyond the parameters of smooth jazz.</TE>
<TE>   George Benson's program displayed yet another way to stretch the
boundaries of pop jazz. Although he devoted a good portion of his
lengthy presentation to his numerous hit tunes--"Turn Your Love
Around," "Everything Must Change," "The Ghetto," etc.--he more than
compensated for the frothy moments by countering with a series of
fiery guitar solos.</TE>
<TE>   Benson was reaping the benefits of the Smooth Jazz genre before
the label came into existence. But as he revealed throughout his set,
he has never allowed his substantial success as a pop artist to
overshadow the simple fact that--when he chooses to do so--he can
still run with the big guys in the straight-ahead jazz field.</TE>

<DH>Emanual Steward, trainer of 29 world champions, prepares
Wesley Snipes to fight in 'Undisputed.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Wild Card Boxing Club in Hollywood is musky and hot when trainer
Emanuel Steward strolls in dressed for the near 100-degree heat all
in beige, with matching loafers, slacks, open-collar shirt and no
socks. His ensemble is accented with gold, including Rolex watch,
bracelet, necklace and a ring commemorating his 1996 induction into
the International Boxing Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   The big, square room is packed with young pugilists and tough
old-timers, but Steward has flown in from his famed Kronk Gym in
Detroit to reunite with a single prospect, Wesley Snipes, the actor
he coached, in this very club, for his role in "Undisputed," the
prison fight movie that opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In "Undisputed," Snipes plays Monroe Hutchen, a once-promising
light-heavyweight who is now a murderer serving a life sentence in a
maximum security prison in the Mojave Desert. Competing in the
Inter-Prison Boxing Program, Hutchen has become invincible--67 wins,
no losses in 10 years of fighting. The inevitable conflict is set
when Ving Rhames, playing the equally invincible, reigning
heavyweight champion, George "Iceman" Chambers, convicted of rape, is
sent to the same desert prison.</LD>
<TE>   Director Walter Hill ("48HRS.," "The Long Riders") and his
co-writer and producer, David Giler, dreamed up the story for
"Undisputed" over lunch at Le Dome. They were interested in exploring
the dramatic possibilities that unfold when "a heavyweight champion
goes to the toughest environment possible in American culture, the
American prison system," Hill said in a phone interview. They
selected actors and settings to accentuate boxing's savage appeal as
well as its precision and artistry.</TE>
<TE>   "I was determined not to have a movie where it looked like" the
actors couldn't box, Hill said. "We always thought of Wesley in the
principal role. He's obviously a very fine actor, but both he and
Ving have the physical attributes that I thought could play credibly
as fighters." Snipes, 40, has played athletes before, most notably a
playground basketball hustler in "White Men Can't Jump" and a boxer
in the 1986 film "Streets of Gold."</TE>
<TE>   Snipes arrives at the Wild Card a few minutes after Steward, and
the two step into a back room to catch up on old times. "Wesley
called me up in 2001, around the first of the year," Steward recalls.
"He asked me would I be interested in training him [for the movie],
and I said, 'If I'm going to get involved, I'm going to train you
exactly as if I would be training you for a championship fight.' "</TE>
<TE>   As an avid boxing fan, Snipes knew that Steward had trained 29
world champions, among them the great Detroit fighter Tommy Hearns
and the current world heavyweight champ, Lennox Lewis. "[My
character] was supposed to be the best," Snipes said, explaining his
reasons for contacting Steward, "so if I've got to look like the
best, and live up to this character, I've got to get the best and
work with the best."</TE>
<TE>   Marquee trainers from the real world of pro boxing are rare in
fight films. Angelo Dundee, one of the greatest trainers in boxing
history, advised Will Smith in "Ali," but Smith was actually trained
by a relative unknown, Darrell Foster, who once trained Sugar Ray
Leonard. In "The Hurricane," Denzel Washington was trained by the
equally little-known Terry Claybon, a three-time Golden Gloves champ
with only five pro fights.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest of the movie trainers was the late Al
Silvani, who never fought a round but perfected his trade in the
vaunted Stillman's Gym in New York, where he trained Rocky Graziano
and Floyd Patterson (Dundee was a mere assistant trainer in
Stillman's). Silvani trained Elvis Presley in his boxing movie, "Kid
Galahad," was an assistant director and advisor for John Huston's
"Fat City," was the "cut man" in "Rocky" and the technical advisor in
"Raging Bull," among other films. But for all his technical
brilliance, Silvani was never well known to the public, and Steward
is arguably the most renowned trainer to coach an actor "hands on"
for the silver screen.</TE>
<TE>   When Hill contacted Rhames, the actor was already in training with
John David Jackson, one of Steward's former champions, for a future
role as Sonny Liston in a feature film about the late heavyweight.
"We called Wesley," Hill recalled, "and said that we'd start looking
for a great trainer to get him in shape and he said, 'Don't worry
about it. I've already got Emanuel Steward.' "</TE>
<TE>   'He Was Ready to Fight'</TE>
<TE>   Steward began training Snipes earlier this year in a little Santa
Monica studio, "where people do ballet and stuff," Steward said. "I
was amazed at how quickly he caught on. I was teaching him basic
steps, the jabbing, how to move, slipping and taking punches. I'd
tell him once and he'd say, 'Gotcha, Coach, gotcha.' Things I thought
it would take him about three weeks to do, by the third day he was
doing perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   After 10 days, Steward moved Snipes into the Wild Card, where they
trained for six weeks. "I still call Wesley 'Champ,' and he still
calls me 'Coach.' He was so good that I really would love to see him
actually have a real professional fight, because when we were
finished training, he was ready to fight," Steward said.</TE>
<TE>   The climactic fight scenes for "Undisputed" were filmed in Las
Vegas, but Hill and his crew still had some technical difficulties to
overcome. "Wesley weighed only 178 pounds," said Steward. "Ving was
about 220 at the time, and that was a handicap."</TE>
<TE>   To mask the disparity, Hill's fight choreographer, Cole McKay, who
had staged the fight sequences for the cable TV movie "Joe &amp; Max"
(about the epic fight between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling) and for
the cable series "Resurrection Blvd.," had Snipes fight upright and
Rhames hunch forward in a crouching stance. McKay took over the
training of Rhames once he reached Las Vegas, and Steward and McKay
worked together to heighten the believability of each round of the
bout.</TE>
<TE>   "Emanuel and I got along really good because once he realized how
we had to do it for the film, he was 100% behind me, and it worked
out tremendous," McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   Following the dramatic arc that Hill and Giler prescribed for the
fight, McKay crafted flurries of exchanges, but only for the
beginnings of each round.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd choreograph six or seven movements and then we'd improvise,"
Snipes said. "We improvised the tail-end of each round, and that gave
a certain amount of spontaneity and reality to it."</TE>
<TE>   Neither actor used a body double, and all of the body shots are
real. Steward was delighted with the authenticity and pacing of the
fight, and that its ultimate outcome was kept secret from the
real-life Nevada prisoners employed as on-screen spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody on the set was wanting to see, 'Man who's going to win
the fight?' " Steward recalls. "There were no 'John Wayne punches' in
this movie at all. It was the closest that I have ever saw to real
fightin'. I was mad because we didn't have [someone] to knock out for
real."</TE>

<HD>Awakening a 'Sleeping Beauty'</HD>
<DH>Movies* Walt Disney's animated classic, one of his labors
of love, is being given a rare 70mm screening at the El Capitan
Theatre. *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney wanted his 1959 animation version of the fairy tale
"Sleeping Beauty" to be the biggest and brightest full-length cartoon
the studio had ever produced--a pretty tall order, considering the
predecessors: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Dumbo,"
"Pinocchio," "Bambi" and "Fantasia."</LD>
<LD>   "There is no question he wanted 'Sleeping Beauty' to be what the
French call ne plus ultra," says Scott MacQueen, who restored
"Sleeping Beauty" five years ago. "It was his biggest film--his most
colorful. It was the most state-of-the-art presentation of animation
that had ever been."</LD>
<LD>   More than six years in the making, "Sleeping Beauty" cost $6
million--at the time a record for an animated film. Produced on
70-millimeter film using three-strip Technicolor and a wide-screen
process called Technirama, it also boasted a six-track stereophonic
mix.</LD>
<TE>   Featuring the music from Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty Ballet,"
the enchanting, sometimes scary fairy tale tells the story of
Princess Aurora, cursed as a newborn by an evil witch named
Maleficent. The evil fairy declares that before Aurora reaches her
16th birthday, she will die. To prevent her death, the three good
fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, take Aurora to live in the
country. But when she is 16, she is discovered by Maleficent and put
to sleep. Only a kiss will awaken Aurora.</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping Beauty" has awakened in its original wide-screen
splendor for a two-week engagement at the El Capitan Theatre in
Hollywood that kicks off Thursday evening with a special
making-of-the-movie panel discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Costa, the famed opera singer who provided the voice of
Aurora, is scheduled to participate, as is legendary Disney animator
Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's "Nine Old Men," who with Frank Thomas
brought Flora, Fauna and Merryweather to delightful life. Rounding
out the panel are MacQueen, animation critic Charles Solomon, musical
historian Alex Rannie and current Disney animator Andreas Deja.</TE>
<TE>   This fully restored wide-screen version of the film has been shown
only once before in Los Angeles, says MacQueen. "It was at the
wide-screen festival a few years back. The last time the El Cap ran
the movie it was the 35-millimeter print, so the 7-millimeter hasn't
had big exposure here."</TE>
<TE>   Costa, now 72, is flying in from home in Knoxville, Tenn. She had
done radio commercials and sang in her church choir in Glendale
before landing the vocal role of Aurora. After the project, with
Disney's encouragement, she pursued her dream of becoming an opera
singer.</TE>
<TE>   All the talent involved in the film, she says, loved the project.
"That comes out in the film, it truly does. I always say this was a
once-upon-a-dream experience for me. It was the happiest time. It
established so many things for me."</TE>
<TE>   Though they communicated only by phone during production, Disney
became one of her biggest influences. He had chosen not to meet her
because, she says, "he didn't want to be influenced by my personality
in person."</TE>
<TE>   Disney, Costa recalls, "would talk to me on the phone after the
recording sessions and he would talk to me about what he expected. He
said, 'Don't have anyone read a line for you. You must pull from your
own gifts of colors.' He believed everybody had a set of colors in
their mind's eye and that is part of their creative imagination. He
didn't believe that anybody should be a copy of another person."</TE>
<TE>   For insight into Aurora, Disney suggested she talk with artist
Marc Davis, who was animating the character. "I asked him so many
questions," Costa says. "I watched him at his storyboards and one
day, I wanted to make Marc Davis laugh. I thought it was a joke when
I said, 'Marc, what do you think the air was like back in the
forest?' He said immediately, 'Caressing.' It wasn't a joke to him at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston says that originally Disney toyed with the idea that
Flora, Fauna and Merryweather should all look the same. "He said, 'We
don't need them to be all different,' " Johnston, 90, recalls. "But
it would have lacked the entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   As with many of Disney's animated films that featured human
characters, a live-action version was filmed for the animators to use
as models. Johnston says that he and Thomas also observed older women
shopping in super markets in order to create the three fairies.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to stare at old ladies and watched them to see how they
behaved and whether they talked to each other," Johnston recalls with
a laugh. "We had fun with it."</TE>
<TE>   Just as with "Fantasia" in 1940, "Sleeping Beauty" wasn't a huge
hit when it was released, grossing just $5.3 million in its initial
release and receiving mixed reviews from the critics, many of whom
thought the film was too elaborate for such a simple story. Bosley
Crowther of the New York Times even criticized the climactic battle
sequence between Maleficent and Aurora's intended, Prince Phillip, as
too scary for children, describing the fight as "the noisiest and
scariest go-around [Disney] has ever put into one of his films." "I
do think it was ahead of its time," says Costa. "It was innovative,
and the backgrounds were so exquisite. It is an art piece."</TE>
<TE>   MacQueen says when the film was released, movies were "getting a
little bit tougher and more realistic. It had to compete in that
market. There wasn't quite the market for fairy tales at that time
than there previously had been."</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping Beauty" also had a distinctly different style than the
previous animated features that many animation fans had a hard time
warming up to. "It is like nothing they have done before or since,"
says MacQueen. "People who are in love with the old style, that whole
European fluid-color look of the early features, sometimes reject it
because of its hard geometry and its bright color. But it uses that
very graphic style brilliantly."</TE>
<TE>   The wide-screen format also allowed the filmmakers to experiment
with visual composition "in ways that I don't think have ever been
matched in animation," says MacQueen. "It uses the frame shape
brilliantly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping Beauty" screens Thursday at 7 p.m. and Friday through
Sept. 8 at noon, 2:30, 5 and 7 p.m. Admission is $10 for adults,
$6.50 for seniors, children and matinees, which are the first two
shows of the day. To order tickets call (800) DISNEY6 or go to

<HD>Scots Singing Praises of 'Jerry Springer'</HD>
<DH>Opera* A confrontation with Satan, blisteringly foul
language and a Ku Klux Klan chorus line share the Fringe Festival's
take on talk-show host.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LAWLESS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>EDINBURGH, Scotland</DL>
<LD>One of the hottest tickets at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival
features expletive-spitting louts, a man clad only in a diaper, a
talk show host and Satan. Naturally, it's an opera.</LD>
<LD>   "Jerry Springer: The Opera" is selling out its daily
performances--and generating talk of a transfer to London's West
End--with its collision of high art and trash TV.</LD>
<LD>   Britain's Observer newspaper called it "very funny, very
foul-mouthed, superbly sung"; the Sunday Times deemed it "splendidly
disrespectful."</LD>
<TE>   Audiences in Edinburgh's ornate Assembly Rooms howl with laughter
from the moment the operatic chorus appears--intoning "My mom used to
be my dad" and emitting a melodic stream of four-letter asides.</TE>
<TE>   The show's creators insist it's no joke.</TE>
<TE>   "You think it's going to be some sort of knockabout burlesque, but
it starts to affect you emotionally," said Stewart Lee, the opera's
London-based director and co-writer.</TE>
<TE>   That may seem an odd claim for a show that features a chorus line
of dancing Ku Klux Klansmen and an all-singing cast of adulterous
spouses, strippers, crack addicts and transsexuals.</TE>
<TE>   But Lee and Richard Thomas, the show's composer and lyricist,
insist Springer is a fit subject for opera.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is an unabashed fan of the Chicago-based show that has
explored topics such as "I married a horse" and "I refuse to wear
clothes" and pits trash-talking guests against catcalling audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "One night I was watching the show, and I realized there were
eight people screaming at each other, a chorus baying for blood, and
I thought, 'That's opera,' " Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   His dual aim, he said, is to reclaim opera for a mass audience and
to celebrate the king of tabloid TV, whose syndicated program was
recently named the worst television show in history by the editors of
TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the real-life Springer was sued by the son of a guest
who was killed by her ex-husband hours after the airing of an episode
in which the couple appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the moral dilemmas the Jerry Springer show poses for the
people who watch it and the people who are on it," said Thomas, whose
other work includes the opera "Tourette's Diva."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a show filled with despair, but it's a huge commercial
success," he said. "People are ashamed to admit they watch it, but
it's a success. It's shameless and it's shameful. That's great for
opera."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the opera's cavalcade of kitsch, it treats those moral
issues seriously, if not subtly. In the second half, Jerry descends
into hell, faces the tragic fallout from his guests' on-screen
confrontations--"A person with less broadcasting experience might
feel responsible," he quips--and attempts to reconcile Jesus and
Satan.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the few negative reviews we've had said the show missed
its satirical target," said Lee, better known in Britain as a
comedian and comedy writer. "Well, it's not meant to be a satire. It
needs to be staged with the same kind of dignity with which you'd do
'Parsifal.' "</TE>
<TE>   Staged simply and performed with gusto by a cast of 21 singers,
the show has a hummable score that touches on everything from Wagner
to jazz to Broadway musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Though purists say it's not really an opera--the character of
Jerry doesn't sing--the piece is operatic in its sweeping emotions
and use of familiar archetypes.</TE>
<TE>   "When Wagner wrote his operas, the myths he wrote about were
common currency," Lee said. This show, he said, is "an opera that
people can relate to, about a subject they can understand."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences so far--in Edinburgh and in earlier workshop runs in
London--have been enthusiastic. So have Britain's theater critics.
But Thomas and Lee are slightly apprehensive about Springer's own
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   They have met Springer--"He said, 'I hear I get shot at the end of
the first act,' " recalled Lee--and say he was sanguine about the use
of his name and image. Springer will be in Edinburgh for a television
festival later this month and has reportedly said he wants to see the
show.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he'll be flattered by the high level of seriousness that
we've applied," Lee says. "I hope he won't be annoyed."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said he has always believed Springer would like the opera.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of think of Jerry Springer as Mephistopheles.... But he
doesn't actually judge his guests. I think he's on the side of the
angels," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is," he concedes, "a minority view."</TE>

<LD>The History Channel received a drubbing in this space a few weeks
ago, after shipping producers "visual guidelines" that urge them to
"give younger experts a chance on camera" and emphasize finding
interview subjects who look good on TV, even if they're not the
leading authority in the field.</LD>
<LD>   Some people were understandably chagrined to think the History
Channel might place its pursuit of younger demographics ahead of the
little things--you know, like history.</LD>
<LD>   Upon further reflection, however, it occurred to me that the
History Channel is hardly unique in viewing its marketing niche,
which must have sounded like such a good idea initially--"You want
history? Well, we got a whole channel of it"--as too confining to
fulfill around the clock without a few compromises.</LD>
<TE>   Plenty of cable networks, in fact, possess terrific brand names
that define them and yet, in a way, also imprison them--leading to
awkward if not downright absurd deviations from what they purport to
deliver.</TE>
<TE>   American Movie Classics? They show movies, all right, but as The
Times' Susan King observed recently, they have a rather liberal
description of "classics," or for that matter American, unless those
productions of "Gammera the Invincible" and "The War of the
Gargantuas" I recall seeing some time back were dubbed into Japanese
and then badly re-dubbed back into English.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the word "classic" is tossed around so freely it should
explore legal options to protect its good name. Consider ESPN
Classics, which fleshes out its roster of "classic" sports (really,
can NASCAR ever be classic?) with sports-themed movies dubbed "Reel
Classics." File in the not-even-close bin this month's entry, "Let It
Ride," a dreadful 1989 horserace betting comedy starring Richard
Dreyfuss.</TE>
<TE>   Let's also not forget Cable News Network, Fox News Channel and
MSNBC, a.k.a. America's NewsChannel. Although each puts "news"
squarely in the middle of its name, all three have adopted a
prime-time strategy clearly more devoted to talk--of the cheap,
windbaggy AM radio variety--than news.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's E! Entertainment Television, whose signature program
these days is "The Anna Nicole Show," which skews more toward the
realm of sideshow curiosity than entertainment. As long as "Anna
Nicole" represents its scheduling centerpiece, the channel can only
bring validity to its "brand" by adopting a more fitting
moniker--say, V! Valium Vision or P! Psychotherapy Cinema.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say niche programming is a bad idea, provided the
niche doesn't become a straitjacket. Lifetime is "television for
women," but that entails more than half the population, leaving
plenty of room to operate, which also holds true for pioneering
channels such as ESPN, MTV and Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   As other, ever narrower networks-come-lately sprout up to fill
digital tiers, however, they face a more delicate juggling
act--compelling some to break from their profile. A case in point
would be Court TV, whose fortunes ebbed and flowed along with the
availability of high-profile trials until the channel successfully
broadened its focus to encompass "crime and justice," a swath wide
enough to accommodate reruns of "NYPD Blue" and "Profiler."</TE>
<TE>   That said, trifling with brand names risks alienating core
constituencies, from the many AMC fans who have expressed dismay
about that network's directional shift, to historians who see the
History Channel's recent edict as misguided pandering.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a debate over some hypothetical mass market versus a
quality market," noted Roger Spiller, the George C. Marshall
professor of military history at the U.S. Army Command and General
Staff College in Ft. Leavenworth, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they defining inclusiveness as 'mediocrity'? I don't think
they're synonymous," Spiller said. "Like so many people in this line
of work, they underestimate the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey C. Ward, who has deftly mixed history and television as
the principal writer of several Ken Burns documentaries--including
"The Civil War," "Baseball" and "Jazz"--echoed those sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "What this shows is the absolute disrespect for the subject that
happens when people try to do history on television ... because they
don't trust the material," said Ward, who is 61. As for finding
"younger experts," he noted, "The idea is to get someone who's 21 or
81, as long as they have something interesting to say. The point is
to tell a story that holds people's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, part of the TV audience regularly has its attention held
by "Anna Nicole," so underestimating them is probably out of the
question. But Ward is right about having faith that challenging
material, presented properly, can galvanize those with a taste for
it.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say that networks should be shackled to their
"brand," already an overused term in TV circles--especially at the
major networks, where viewers still bond with specific programs, not
a channel or even a night. Just ask NBC, which has watched one rookie
after another strike out in the time slot after "Friends," proving
that what must be seen is in the eye of the remote holder.</TE>
<TE>   Still, viewers do come to the dial armed with certain
expectations, and as television becomes a cacophony of choice, cable
networks have clearly benefited. ESPN doesn't need to be all things
to all people but thrives as a default option for men--let's see
who's playing--in much the way kids make Nickelodeon their first
stop.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that only works if these destination channels don't disappoint
them. Flip to ESPN and find a knitting bee and men will be gone in
the time it takes to pop open a beer can--just as children would bail
if they stopped at Nickelodeon and heard, "Tonight, on 'Murder, She
Wrote' ... "</TE>
<TE>   On a more fundamental level, it also does a disservice to the
language to call yourself one thing and act like another. Besides, TV
spends so much time misleading viewers with over-hyped promos, at a
time when there is renewed talk of corporate responsibility, a simple
commitment to truth in advertising (if that phrase isn't oxymoronic)
would doubtlessly be appreciated, newsworthy and, heck, it might even
be historic.</TE>
<TE>   Just please, whatever you do, don't call it classic.</TE>

<LD>   Downed Pilot Sues Fox and Discovery Channel</LD>
<LD>   Scott O'Grady, a pilot who became a hero after being shot down in
Bosnia, has sued Twentieth Century Fox and TV's Discovery Channel,
saying they profited from his ordeal without securing the proper
rights. He's charging the companies with invasion of privacy through
the false appropriation of his name.</LD>
<TE>   In papers filed in federal district court in Texarkana, Texas,
O'Grady said that Fox's "Behind Enemy Lines," released in 2001, was
based on his 1995 escape. The film, starring Gene Hackman and Owen
Wilson, revolved around a reconnaissance pilot shot down over Bosnia.
Evading hostile forces, he is ultimately saved by the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   O'Grady alleges that the commercial value of his name and identity
have been damaged by the movie, in which he was portrayed as a
"hot-dog" pilot who disobeyed orders and used foul language. He now
works as a motivational speaker and has authored a children's book on
his experience.</TE>
<TE>   O'Grady is seeking legal fees and profits from the movie and
Discovery's "Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O'Grady Story," which was
shown several times over the course of three years before the film
hit the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Fox and the Discovery Channel had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Film Quotas: A Hot Topic in Moscow</TE>
<TE>   How many American films are healthy for the Russian marketplace?
The question has sparked debate among leading figures in the
country's entertainment community.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, Karen Shakhnazarov, head of
Mosfilm--Russia's top movie studio--has publicly called for quotas.
Only affirmative action for home-grown filmmakers can restore
production to the 150 movies a year turned out during the Soviet era,
he maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "The key distributors in Russia are practically all controlled by
the Hollywood majors and are obliged to screen around two new films a
week. Russian films are squeezed to the least popular show times,
said the producer-director, whose own " Zvezda" was relegated by the
popular Pushkin Film Theater to a 9 a.m. slot.</TE>
<TE>   Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi acknowledges that Soviet films
constitute only 2% of the market share. But quotas aren't the answer,
he insists, arguing that cutting the number of American films would
adversely affect box office--and, therefore, the exhibitors. And it
could also cut into the current wave of investment in theaters and
distribution, he says.</TE>
<TE>   A Family Feud Over Hendrix Estate</TE>
<TE>   Jimi Hendrix's father, who died April 17, was gone less than a day
when his family started fighting over his estate--valued at more than
$100 million.</TE>
<TE>   His son Leon, Jimi's 54-year-old brother, had his lawyers fax a
letter to representatives of Janie Hendrix, his 41-year-old
stepsister. Don't freeze him out of his dad's holdings, he warned.
And the battle has intensified since then, the Seattle Times reports.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Leon's lawyers filed three suits in Seattle's King
County Superior Court, hoping to take control of the estate from
Janie. The papers allege that their father was incompetent when he
signed a 1998 trust agreement making her the primary heir. Al
Hendrix, he said, was "functionally illiterate," a simple, easily
influenced man with a drinking problem. And Janie, he charged, had
campaigned to get him to disown his son. Leon's only inheritance at
this point: one gold Jimi Hendrix record--selected by Janie.</TE>
<TE>   Janie paints Leon as a former drug addict and criminal and refutes
charges that she interfered with his efforts to enter the music
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Having been named president of the company that manages Jimi's
estate in 1995, she is credited with helping to raise its value. Once
worth $500,000, it earned $8 million last year, according to Forbes
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic to Keep an Online Tour Diary</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, fans of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and music
director Esa-Pekka Salonen can keep up with the orchestra's European
tour long-distance. Just log on to www .laphil.com to read a daily
journal kept by managing director Deborah Borda, the musicians and
board members.</TE>
<TE>   The trip, which includes stops in Lucerne, Edinburgh, London,
Brussels and Helsinki, begins today and runs through Sept. 5. All the
performances, some of which were previewed at the Hollywood Bowl in
recent weeks, are sold out.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Though Barbra Streisand has "retired" from performing, she has
agreed to sing at a Democratic Congressional Committee fund-raiser at
the Kodak Theatre on Sept. 29....Gloria Estefan and Jimmy Smits will
co-host the third-annual Latin Grammy Awards on Sept. 18....Despite a
letter-writing campaign from fans, A&amp;E has canceled its drama series
"Nero Wolfe." ... CBS has ordered six episodes of Universal's
one-hour drama about a law firm set in the future, from
writer-producers Paul Attanasio and Ed Zuckerman.... NAACP Image
Awards President Ernestine Peters has left the organization amid
rumors of a investigation into its finances. Peters would not return
phone calls, and NAACP executives declined comment. Executives with
the organization said the ceremony would still take place next
year.... ABC's "Good Morning America" will originate from inside the
Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Black Crowes put new twists on familiar rock and soul licks
in the '90s, they gave Gen-X its own classic-rock band. So it's no
surprise that lead singer Chris Robinson's new solo material conjured
up similar musical ghosts during an acoustic performance Monday at
the El Rey Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The vibe was different than a Crowes concert, as the affable
Robinson and Paul Stacey, who co-produced the forthcoming solo debut
"New Earth Mud," played guitars sitting down for an hour and 40
minutes. The sounds ranged from country-folk to R&amp;B balladry to
psychedelic rock as they previewed about half the CD due in October,
and offered renditions of classic numbers by Ray Charles, the Band
and others.</LD>
<LD>   There was even a sense of continuity with the old days, as
ex-Crowe Marc Ford, who co-wrote Robinson's languid "Sunday Sound,"
joined in for the encore. But the music was a little less Stones and
Faces, a little more Van Morrison and Bob Dylan, with Stacey
providing sonic drama in his tasteful, evocative slide work and
delicate finger-picking.</LD>
<TE>   Still, partly because Robinson evoked songwriters that few can
equal, the show had that same Crowes-esque sense of preserving,
rather than furthering, the music he loves. His messages about the
serenity of love and the need to move on in one's life were certainly
more personal, but the sentiments felt overly simplistic.</TE>
<TE>   Even when he crafted compelling images, as in the reflective
"Silver Car," the songs eventually meandered, as if his ambition
exceeded his ability to express himself.</TE>

<HD>Erasing Doubt in N.Y. Plan</HD>
<DH>Stepping back from last month's World Trade Center site
proposals is wise, but a more open contest would be better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lower Manhattan Development Corp.'s decision last week to solicit
new designs for the World Trade Center site is the kind of backward
step that should be greeted with a measured degree of praise.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, when the agency unveiled six designs for the site, the
plans were met with open hostility. The public, at a hearing that was
one of the largest in New York City's history, attacked them as an
inadequate response to the site's symbolic importance. Critics
derided the proposals for their lack of imagination.</LD>
<LD>   The development corporation's latest shift in strategy is an
attempt to reverse some of the damage done by that initial
announcement. The agency will select five firms by the end of
September to take part in a limited competition for the site's
design. Each firm will then be paid a $40,000 stipend to develop the
proposals, which must be submitted by Nov. 30. The field will be
narrowed to three candidates by the end of the year, and a final
design will be selected by mid-2003.</LD>
<TE>   The result could possibly be a higher level of design. But the
selection process is also part of the story. It will send an
important signal about how much our democratic values matter. By
limiting the number of participants in the competition to five, the
agency is ensuring that the debate about ground zero's future will
remain relatively narrow. And in that sense, the competition falls
far short of the kind of open discourse that is the public's right.</TE>
<TE>   To call the development corporation's process a competition is
somewhat misleading. Real competitions are open to anyone--that is,
to any designer willing to sacrifice the time, energy and money it
takes to produce a viable proposal. Typically, a jury whittles down
the original list of entries, which can number in the hundreds, to a
handful of finalists. The finalists usually then compete in a second
round before a winner is selected.</TE>
<TE>   In the development corporation process, the initial list of
finalists will be selected in response to a formal "request for
qualifications," meaning that they will not have to produce a design.
Instead, the five will be selected according to their level of
experience and examples of past work. Given the number of state and
local groups vying for control of the site, it remains unclear who
will actually make the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Such hybrid competitions have become a favorite of major American
institutions in recent years. The reason is control. Open
competitions allow architects to work in relative freedom and
seclusion, far from the watchful gaze of the client. The results are
often unexpected.  In a more limited competition, the client usually
works more closely with the architectural teams in mapping out a
shared vision. The point of that input, the argument goes, is to
ensure that architects don't stray too far from their mandate to
indulge in irrelevant fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet open competitions are not a new phenomenon. Sir Charles
Barry's House of Parliament in London, for example, whose soaring
gothic spires overlook the River Thames, was commissioned in 1835
after a competition that drew 97 entries, many of them by amateurs.
Charles Garnier's 1875 Paris Opera House, an ornate pastiche of
classical styles, was selected over 171 entries. In more recent
memory, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers' controversial 1971 design for
Paris' Pompidou Center, with its pumped-up high-tech exterior, was
selected out of 681 entries. All of these buildings are now
considered beloved landmarks in their respective cities.</TE>
<TE>   When competitions go wrong, it is almost always because of the
quality of the jury, which can make muddle-headed decisions. In a
1989 competition for Paris' Tres Grand Bibliotheque, for example,
which drew 250 entrants, most independent observers felt that Rem
Koolhaas' proposal--a gigantic glass cube with a series of
amoeba-shaped public halls carved through its translucent form--was
the most compelling. But Koolhaas came in second to French architect
Dominique Perrault, and most now view the competition as a missed
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   That may be the real reason that juries, usually made up of
political appointees, often feel so uneasy about an open competition
process. It could make them look dumb. Great losing designs linger in
the imagination--a testament to what could have been.</TE>
<TE>   The Lower Manhattan Development Corp., still feeling the sting
from last month's public hearing, seems to have become more sensitive
to such issues. As part of their revamped strategy, agency officials
have invited New York New Visions--a coalition of architects,
planners and business leaders--to take part in the selection process
and to make recommendations for the short list. The idea is to bring
in more outside expertise. But the coalition is not as independent as
it may seem. Many of the agency's initial guidelines for the site
were drawn from an unsolicited document New York New Visions unveiled
in January.</TE>
<TE>   In the past few months, the development corporation guidelines
have only become more specific. They originally required a mix of
commercial, retail and housing in the 16-acre site, reestablishment
of part of the former street grid, and designating the footprints of
the former World Trade Center towers as memorial space. A recent
addition calls for the creation of a grand promenade along West
Street that would link the site to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island ferries in Battery Park.</TE>
<TE>   The development corporation says that the current guidelines are a
reflection of an emerging public consensus. The promenade, for
example, was met with widespread public approval at the July hearing.
And the agency is also continuing to reach out to various
communities. It will hold the first of a series of new hearings in
the five boroughs and New Jersey starting tonight.</TE>
<TE>   But pandering to the public is not the same as offering it a
choice. The public may be able to condemn a design, but it cannot
imagine what it has not yet seen. That is the role of the
architect--to create real proposals that can be debated, attacked or
admired. In doing so, they broaden the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the process to such a degree of public scrutiny would take
courage. In a very real sense, the public would have more of a say in
the site's future. It could push aside the desires of developers and
downtown stakeholders that have so much invested in the site's
commercial value. Of course, that may be exactly what the development
corporation is trying to avoid. If the public falls in love with a
project, for example, would the agency be able to reject it?</TE>
<TE>   The unspoken assumption is that the public is incapable of
grasping the complex issues that the site's redevelopment involves.
Worse still, they may derail a process already in motion. The agency
is following a rigid timetable, and restarting the competition has
set the agency six months behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   But getting the process right is obviously worth the sacrifice in
time. The lesson of the July hearing was that the average New Yorker
understands architecture's importance in fulfilling the site's
symbolic mission. They also know mediocrity when they see it. And
they have made it clear that they consider the site part of the
public realm.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians, planners and critics have a role to play in all of
this. They should offer their expertise. They should seek to educate
the public on the implications of certain design and planning
decisions. Ultimately, the network of politicians and agencies that
rule the site will make the final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, only opening the process to the widest possible range of
ideas will prevent another misstep. Doing so would serve as a
meaningful response to the barbarity of the Sept. 11 attacks. It
would reaffirm our faith in the messiness of the democratic process.
That is a message that would resonate.</TE>

<HD>A 'Wintertime' Snow Is Falling on Romance</HD>
<DH>At La Jolla Playhouse, Charles L. Mee evokes comic masters
in a tale of tangled love affairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Wintertime, and the livin' ain't easy. Tempers are jumpin', and the
jealousy is high.</LD>
<LD>   Charles L. Mee's delirious new comedy "Wintertime," at La Jolla
Playhouse, is set at an Eastern summer home in the dead of winter.
Members of a fractured family and their lovers arrive for supposedly
private trysts, only to discover that other members of the family had
the same idea. Recriminations soon escalate to enormous tantrums and
extravagant displays of tacky underwear and bare bums.</LD>
<LD>   Mee, who takes pride in his inspiration from others, conjures up
thoughts of Coward's "Hay Fever" and the rhythms of Feydeau, which
are especially obvious when one character wheels out a door and
ritualistically prepares it for a round of vigorous slamming in which
everyone participates.</LD>
<TE>   But Coward and Feydeau aren't the half of it. The reason why the
door has to be brought to the stage is because Annie Smart's set
otherwise lacks doors and walls. This living room is inextricably
interwoven with the bare trees, which grow right where the divan
should be, and the falling snow. Mee's play is a voyage into the
human heart that ventures far beyond naturalistic confines.</TE>
<TE>   The course of the conversation is sometimes Chekhovian. Mee's
script also acknowledges that he incorporated text by Laurie Williams
and that he was deeply affected by Anne Carson's book "Eros the
Bittersweet." When the plot goes bizarrely haywire, the most striking
twist owes something besides a similar title to Shakespeare's "The
Winter's Tale."</TE>
<TE>   This brazen mixture of classic echoes and contemporary talk
confirms Mee's belief in his brand of stylistic collage. The play
acquires a dazzling originality in the way it assembles its effects
from so many sources. It's a rip-roaring comedy that becomes an
intellectual high-wire act.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a platform for some wild comedy performances, none more
so than that of Francois Giroday as, well, Francois, the tres French
lover of the lady of the house, Maria (Randy Danson). Francois starts
the ball of suspicions rolling when he praises young Ariel (Emily
Donahoe), the girlfriend of Maria's son Jonathan (Daoud Heidami) a
little too liberally, in the opinion of Maria and Jonathan.</TE>
<TE>   Before the first act is over, Giroday has delivered the play's
most inspired aria on romantic dilemmas, has been revealed as the cad
who abandoned yet another lover (Michi Barall) and has donned black
lingerie for a kind of striptease in front of a gay man.</TE>
<TE>   The man in question is Edmund (Tom Nelis), the lover of Maria's
bisexual husband, Frank (Nicholas Hormann). As the amusingly
well-composed Frank bounces back and forth between Edmund and Maria,
Nelis works up a head of grief that passes through overstatement to
the realm of the ridiculous, particularly at a second-act memorial
service.</TE>
<TE>   Two neighbors, the aging lesbian couple Hilda (Lola Pashalinski)
and Bertha (Lauren Klein), also make a vivid splash. But the play's
funniest scene belongs to Bob (Bruce McKenzie), who arrives to
deliver an unsolicited compost maker, proceeds to deliver unsolicited
remarks on the importance of love in Greek myth and then attributes
all of the world's problems--up to and including Jeffrey Dahmer--to
the loss of love.</TE>
<TE>   The entire play is shot through with prerecorded musical
selections. The snippets of heart-on-sleeve opera that dominate the
bulk of the soundtrack eventually give way to lighter, jazz-and
pop-flavored numbers, reflecting the eventual evolution of the script
into a surprisingly--though not entirely--happy ending.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arts in Corrections is a state-funded program that exists at every
California prison to expose inmates to art, music, literature and the
performing arts in hopes of providing them skills and interests that
will generate a more positive focus when they return home.</LD>
<LD>   Deborah Tobola, who runs the program at the California Men's
Colony at San Luis Obispo, said the annual budget is "very small" and
provides mainly for hiring teachers to come in and work with
interested prisoners each week. Occasionally they bring in
performers: The Drifters did a concert there last December; a group
of poets visited in April.</LD>
<LD>   "Arts in Corrections helps inmates, through the discipline of fine
arts, leave prison and not come back," Tobola said, pointing to a
study showing that prison inmates who get involved in the program
have lower recidivism rates than those who don't.</LD>

<HD>Thoughtful Sides of Rival Rappers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two careers, two lives cut short: Such is the inextricable link
between Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. Onetime allies, they
became bitter rivals, only to be symbolically reunited in violent
deaths six months apart.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, VH1 will focus on the rappers' lives individually, in two
very different installments of its series "Driven." Each show reveals
the thoughtful side to performers known for their gangsta antics on
and off stage, presenting them as complex, tragic figures whose lives
and slayings remain mysterious to this day.</LD>
<LD>   "Notorious B.I.G.," at 8 p.m., is an intoxicating, kinetic hour of
video clips, photos and interviews. Christopher Wallace, a.k.a.
B.I.G., starts out as a star student, brought up by his Jamaican
mother to defend himself with words instead of fists. But by 11th
grade he drops out, a drug dealer who would become a ghetto superstar
with his raps. Producer Sean "Puffy" Combs sets him on the path to
mainstream stardom, but it was a path that ended in a March 1997
drive-by shooting in L.A. He was 24.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, "Thug Angel: The Life of an Outlaw," at 11 p.m., is
in the stylistic tradition of more serious documentary, yet it goes
far beyond straightforward biography. The film, which was released on
DVD in April, expresses the view that Shakur was a political activist
whose message was too strong for its time.</TE>
<TE>   It opens with a videotape of a wide-eyed 17-year-old Shakur
talking about the values--respect, outspokenness and the pursuit of
knowledge--taught to him by his mother. But soon he's espousing the
"thug life," with all its contradictions. In one memorable scene, he
stands on a firing range, shooting up targets of a pistol-packing man
in a suit and tie, talking about spreading love in the ghettos.</TE>
<TE>   A chart-topping rapper and budding actor, he would be fatally
wounded on a street in Las Vegas in September 1996. He was 25.</TE>

<LD>The combination of preseason football and original unscripted summer
series helped every major network except ABC increase its audience
last week versus the corresponding period in 2001, as the unscripted
shows continue to fare especially well among younger viewers, based
on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Those wanting to know why networks are keen on these properties,
in fact, need look no further than demographic breakdowns for adults
18 to 49, the primary age bracket coveted by advertisers. By that
standard, summer replacements--Fox's two plays of "American Idol,"
NBC's "Dog Eat Dog" and "Meet My Folks," and a pair of CBS' "Big
Brother" episodes--accounted for the top half-dozen shows.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, meanwhile, is still lagging behind the field, down 27%
compared with the same week last year, while CBS, NBC and Fox all
improved their viewership by more than 10%. ABC's most-watched
program, "My Wife and Kids," ranked No. 27 overall.</LD>
<TE>   NBC also used the week to jump-start its third entry in the "Law &amp;
Order" franchise, "Criminal Intent," running three episodes of the
crime drama in the time slots regularly occupied by its two
predecessors and "ER." The series responded with its highest ratings
of the summer. CBS also benefited from a double dose of "CSI," which
won its time period both Thursday and Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (Aug. 12-18) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<LD>Myanmar--An article in Thursday's Business section on U.S. retailers
cutting ties to Myanmar contained a quote that was incorrectly
attributed to David Steinberg, director of Asian studies at
Georgetown University. It was Jeremy Woodrum, director of the Free
Burma Coalition's Washington office, who said, "I think it's
encouraging that so many companies are willing to take action against
forced labor."</LD>

<HD>Unocal Offers to Buy Rest of Pure Resources</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unocal Corp. offered to buy the 35% of Pure Resources Inc. that it
doesn't own for about $440 million in stock to expand operations in
the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Pure Resources was formed in May 2000 when Unocal spun off its oil
and natural-gas exploration operations in Texas and New Mexico and
merged them with Titan Exploration Inc. The Midland, Texas-based
company pumped the equivalent of 357.3 million cubic feet of natural
gas last year.</LD>
<LD>   El Segundo-based Unocal said it would exchange 0.6527 share for
each Pure Resources share.</LD>
<TE>   Based on Tuesday's closing prices, the offer values Pure Resources
at a 27% premium. Unocal closed at $34.09, down 69 cents, while Pure
closed at $17.52, down 28 cents, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was announced after trading ended.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal said it wants sole ownership of Pure Resources' oil and gas
assets concentrated in the Permian Basin of west Texas, the San Juan
Basin in New Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast to increase
cash flow and cut costs, spokesman Barry Lane said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Man Pleads Guilty in Securities Fraud Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man pleaded guilty to securities fraud for cheating 200
investors while running a $21-million scheme that lasted seven years.</LD>
<LD>   Gary A. Eisenberg, 64, promised investors they would make up to
18% interest annually, with little risk, by putting money into his
businesses from 1994 to 2001, authorities said. He said he would lend
the money to well-known companies that pledged their accounts
receivables as collateral.</LD>
<LD>   Eisenberg's Advanced Finance Holding Inc. of Beverly Hills filed
for bankruptcy protection in late 2001. Eisenberg is cooperating with
federal prosecutors and "acknowledges and accepts full responsibility
for the mistakes that were made by him," said John Cotton, his
lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Eisenberg agreed to plead guilty to four felony charges and pay
back investors in exchange for a recommended sentence of about four
to five years, prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Cisco to Buy Storage Switch Firm Andiamo</HD>
<DH>Tech: Company says it may pay as much as $2.5 billion for
the start-up, depending on its sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN KLAYMAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of equipment that runs the
Internet, said Tuesday that it will buy Andiamo Systems Inc. but
won't close the deal until 2004, waiting to see if the small start-up
can become a top player in the data storage switch business.</LD>
<LD>   Cisco said the net price could be as much as $2.5 billion but the
final price, based on Andiamo's sales, will not be determined until
the deal closes. SG Cowen analyst Christin Armacost estimates the
deal could be valued between $300 million and $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The wide range of the deal's possible closing price will be based
on Andiamo's sales during a three-month period shortly before
closing, and on Cisco's sales and its stock price.</LD>
<TE>   Andiamo's switch products are used to route information in
computer networks that store and share company data. Andiamo, which
started operating less than two years ago, has recorded no revenue to
date and just unveiled a line of products.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco is betting that privately held Andiamo's sales will take
off, allowing it to grab a piece of the market, which is expected to
grow from about $1.2 billion this year to $4.3 billion in 2006, the
company said, citing Gartner Group data.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely incremental revenues," Merrill Lynch analyst
Samuel Wilson said. "Cisco right now has two storage products ...
which have been relatively ho-hum. This gets them head to head in the
storage switch market, which is where Brocade [Communications Systems
Inc.] and McData [Corp.] play." Merrill Lynch has advised Cisco on
past acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   It is the fourth acquisition of a small, privately held firm
announced by Cisco this year. Cisco President and Chief Executive
John Chambers has said the firm will acquire eight to 12 small to
medium-sized companies this year.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Vallecillo, senior portfolio manager with Armada Funds, which
owns Cisco shares, said the San Jose company wants to pressure
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, it's going to be a black cloud hanging over Brocade," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Ariane Mahler was
skeptical about Cisco becoming a dominant player in a competitive
market. In 2001, Cisco signed a deal that gave it the right to buy
Andiamo, which employs 270 people and also is based in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
it will provide Andiamo with an additional $100 million in funding
until the deal closes.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco shares rose 1 cent to $14.73 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Dell to Sell Unbranded PCs Through Dealers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER J. BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp., the world's second-largest personal-computer
maker, will sell low-cost PCs without the Dell brand name through
small U.S. dealers, a bid to boost sales by distributing products
through third parties.</LD>
<LD>   Dell will begin selling the unbranded PCs this week starting at
$499 without a monitor to dealers, often called "white-box makers,"
Dell spokeswoman Amy King said. Dell isn't altering its model of
selling directly to customers through the Web or by phone, King said.
Dealers will buy the computers from Dell after customers place orders
for them.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not the typical channel program with price protection and
you build inventory," she said. "These are built to order. This is a
market that we haven't targeted before."</LD>
<TE>   Many small businesses hire such dealers to run their computer
systems, making it a $3-billion annual market, she said.</TE>
<TE>   White-box makers account for 40% of the U.S. market for desktop
PCs sold to companies with fewer than 100 employees, King said. Dell
wants to generate $380 million in sales in this market in the next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's largest PC maker, can offer
similarly priced PCs with "real service and support," said
spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just throw boxes into the channel," Robboy said. "HP
has a long-term commitment and long-standing history with the
channel."</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Dell executives said the company plans to double
revenue from professional services in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Dell won't grow through large acquisitions, said Jeff Lynn, Dell's
vice president of professional services, but it may make some small
acquisitions in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares fell 42 cents to $27.70 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Rule on Swaps May Spur Restatements</HD>
<DH>Telecom: SEC might order new earnings reports from firms
that recorded cable-capacity trades as revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHMIDT</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission might force some
telecommunications companies to restate earnings after prohibiting
carriers this month from recording revenue from swaps of fiber-optic
cable capacity, accountants say.</LD>
<LD>   Companies use the swaps to trade use of their cables. Some have
been recognizing revenue on the transactions, a practice that's the
subject of SEC, Justice Department and congressional investigations
of accounting at Global Crossing Ltd. and Qwest Communications
International Inc. SEC staff said some capacity swaps should be
treated as asset exchanges, and companies can't record revenue from
them, accountants said.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest and Global Crossing have said capacity sales accounted for
at least $2.6 billion in revenue in 2000 and 2001. Qwest, which
Tuesday said it agreed to sell its directories unit for $7.05
billion, has said it might have to restate earnings related to
capacity-swap transactions. Global Crossing is reviewing the way it
recorded them, and other companies might be affected as well,
accountants and analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is significant," said Scott Cleland, chief executive of the
Washington-based Precursor Group, a research firm that focuses on
telecommunications issues. "Global Crossing and Qwest didn't just
swap with themselves, they were involved with many others."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC notified companies of the new policy in a phone call to
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, not through a
public announcement, said Jay Hartig, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Florham Park, N.J., and chairman of the SEC
regulations committee at the AICPA, a trade organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC has indicated that it expects public companies to make
the change by retroactive restatement," Hartig said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Overton, an associate chief accountant in the SEC's
division of corporation finance, confirmed the change. She declined
to comment on the specifics or say which companies the rule applies
to.</TE>
<TE>   "It says what it says, and it's all we intended to convey,"
Overton said.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to tell which companies might be affected by the
rule, analysts and accountants said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's new policy might "apply to any situation where companies
are swapping assets that are used in their businesses," said Doug
Carmichael, director of the Center for Financial Integrity at Baruch
College in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Some energy trading firms also sold the swaps, known as IRUs or
Indefeasible Rights to Use, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The practice "is utterly unregulated; there is no government
entity that has any knowledge about how these companies have done
this," said Reed Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission and now a telecommunications consultant.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Bond Sales Show Signs of Picking Up</HD>
<DH>Securities: The offerings slowed in July amid concerns
about some companies' accounting and weak profit growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign that the corporate debt market may be stabilizing,
companies are on track to sell $13.65 billion in bonds this week,
including $3.76 billion sold on Tuesday--the most in one day since
June 18.</LD>
<LD>   The offerings come after corporate bond sales slowed in July to
$16.18 billion--the lowest monthly total since March 1995--amid
concerns about companies' accounting and weak profit growth. With
benchmark borrowing costs near all-time lows, some companies are
taking the opportunity to raise cheap capital, and investors are more
eager to buy.</LD>
<LD>   Among the issuers Tuesday were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Colonial Pipeline Co.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very much a feast-or-famine world right now," said Craig
Nunez, treasurer of Colonial, which sold $185 million of 30-year
bonds. "Maybe we took a risk, but we actually believed that in this
market, with absolute yields down where they were and with not much
paper coming, that we might be well-received. We guessed right."</TE>
<TE>   Investors backed away from credit risk last month as the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index fell to a five-year low and about $2.8 billion of
sales were canceled during the last two weeks of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Companies perceived as safer investments are among those finding
demand for their issues. For instance, Gillette Co. and Procter &amp;
Gamble Co., established companies selling well-known products, were
able to attract investors at the end of July. Regional banks are
another industry perceived as safe.</TE>
<TE>   With benchmark interest rates so low, some companies want to sell.
The 10-year Treasury note yield reached an all-time low of 3.96%
during intraday trading Aug. 14, one day after the Federal Reserve
decided to hold its key interest rate steady at a 41-year low of
1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Hedge Funds Inflow Falls 18% in 2nd Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Hedge funds attracted a net $4.57 billion in the second quarter,
down 18% from the first three months of the year, Tremont Advisers
Inc. said.</TE>
<TE>   Money coming into hedge funds, private partnerships for wealthy
individuals and institutions, may slow further in coming months if
the funds continue to post lackluster returns. Overall, hedge funds
have lost 0.03% this year, according to the CSFB/Tremont Hedge Fund
index.</TE>
<TE>   Their performance through July was better than the 20.7% drop in
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, but many investors expected hedge
funds to make money this year because they can bet on falling as well
as rising prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Some investors are saying 'I expected better,' " said Kevin
Ferro, head of Ferro Capital. He said some hedge funds had successful
fund-raising in June and July, and others faced redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Total hedge fund assets are estimated to be about $550 billion.
The funds took in a total of $10.2 billion in the first half,
compared with $31 billion for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEC to Vote Next Week</TE>
<TE>   on Filing Deadline</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide next week
whether to override corporate opposition and approve a rule to speed
up companies' financial disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said it will vote Aug. 27 on the rule. It would require
quarterly earnings reports to be filed within 30 days of the end of
the quarter rather than 45 days. Annual reports would have to be made
within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year instead of 90.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, under pressure from Congress and
investors, has called for fuller, faster disclosures to protect
stockholders from the kind of accounting failures that led Enron
Corp. to file for bankruptcy last December.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 Fortune 500 companies have objected, saying tighter
deadlines will lead to erroneous and incomplete reports.</TE>

<HD>Taxable Sales in California Fall for 3 Straight Quarters</HD>
<DH>Economy: Data show a 4.5% drop in the first quarter
compared with year-ago results. Some counties post gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's taxable sales have declined for three straight quarters,
the worst performance since the deep downturn of the early 1990s and
an illustration of how the recession and tech meltdown have hurt the
California economy.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary data from the State Board of Equalization show that
taxable transactions totaled $99.5 billion in the first quarter of
2002. That's a decrease of 4.5% from the same quarter in 2001, when
taxable sales totaled $104.2 billion. Year-over-year taxable sales
fell about 5.1% in the fourth quarter last year and dipped 2.9% in
the third quarter of 2001. Taxable sales include retail sales as well
as taxable business-to-business transactions.</LD>
<LD>   Sales taxes are the state's second-largest source of revenue after
the personal income tax, so their decline is a big reason why
California is facing a $23.6-billion budget shortfall. As recently as
2000, annual taxable sales in California soared by 11.9% to $441.9
billion, led by the then-highflying Silicon Valley. What went up in
the tech boom, however, has fallen hard in the bust. County figures
just released by the State Board of Equalization for the third
quarter of 2001 show the steepest declines occurred in the Bay Area,
linked directly to the popping of the technology bubble.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Clara County, the heart of the Silicon Valley, saw its
taxable sales plunge 21.4% in the third quarter of 2001. San
Francisco County's performance was similarly dismal, with a 16.7%
decline, followed by a 14.6% drop in San Mateo County.</TE>
<TE>   Slumping retail sales accounted for part of the decline, as the
spike in unemployment in the Bay Area, coupled with a tumbling stock
market, took a toll on consumer spending. But the swoon in technology
investment and business spending has played a big role as well, said
Ted Gibson, former chief economist with the California Department of
Finance.</TE>
<TE>   "During the boom times, places like Santa Clara were just surging
ahead because of business-to-business [transactions]," said Gibson, a
senior economic advisor with Los Angeles-based financial services
firm MetWest Financial. "You are seeing the backside of that now."</TE>
<TE>   Taxable sales have slipped in Southern California, but nowhere
near the extent of the Bay Area. In Los Angeles County, such sales
dipped 0.8% in the third quarter of 2001 compared with the third
quarter of 2000, State Board of Equalization data showed.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County saw a decline of 2.6% over the same period, while
San Diego County eked out a gain of 1.9%. San Bernardino had a
taxable sales gain of 2.4%, while Ventura had a 3% increase.
Riverside County posted one of the best performances in the state,
with a gain of 7.2%.</TE>

<HD>Cendant to Trim Hotels, Staffing to Boost Quality</HD>
<DH>Services: Reductions are aimed at certain franchises. Firm
also reportedly agrees to buy Budget Group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE MACINTOSH and JEFFREY GOLDFARB</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Travel services giant Cendant Corp. said Tuesday that it will rid
itself of as many as 7% of its hotel rooms and cut its hotel staff by
130 jobs, or 15%, in a bid to boost the overall quality of that
business.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant, the owner of Avis, also reportedly has reached a deal
with Budget Group Inc. creditors to buy the insolvent car rental
agency for $107.5 million in cash and the assumption of $3 billion of
Budget's vehicle debt.</LD>
<LD>   With Budget, Cendant would be creating the second-largest U.S.
rental car company behind Enterprise Rent-a-Car Co., moving ahead of
Hertz Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant, whose hotel brands include Days Inn, Super 8, Ramada and
Howard Johnson, said it will aim its cuts at hotels that have failed
quality tests and at franchisees who have defaulted on fee payments.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based firm, the biggest U.S. hotel franchiser, said
it put the first 300 properties tagged for cuts on notice last week.
The hotels were the worst in a set of offenders that consistently
failed quality tests or defaulted on payments, said Steve Rudnitsky,
chief executive of the company's hotel group.</TE>
<TE>   The plan will purge as many as 40,000 rooms from Cendant's
portfolio on top of the 20,000 to 30,000 rooms in poorly performing
hotels typically eliminated each year.</TE>
<TE>   With the Budget deal, Cendant would leave behind Budget's
struggling European operations and take on Budget's ailing truck
rental unit, a person familiar with the situation said Tuesday.
However, Cendant reportedly plans to eventually shut down the truck
business.</TE>
<TE>   Because Budget, based in Daytona Beach, Fla., has filed for
bankruptcy protection, it must open itself to other bidders, but the
company has shopped itself for a long time without much interest,
according to people familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   A Budget spokeswoman declined to comment, and Cendant could not
immediately be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant shares fell 2 cents to $14.89 on the New York Stock
Exchange, while Budget was unchanged at 13 cents in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that a former vice
president of Cendant, Rick Del Sontro, cannot collect up to $700,000
he sought from the company for stock losses he suffered because of a
1998 accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Del Sontro said he may appeal the decision.</TE>

<HD>Cingular Reportedly Discussing Merger</HD>
<DH>Wireless: A deal with VoiceStream could spark industry-wide
consolidation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spurred by stiff competition and slowing growth, cell phone carriers
Cingular Wireless and VoiceStream Wireless are in exploratory merger
talks that could spark the beginning of the industry's long-awaited
consolidation, sources say.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations, said to be in the early stages, came as
Atlanta-based Cingular announced plans Tuesday to lay off 3,000
employees, or about 7.5% of its work force, to cut costs and
restructure its sales operations.</LD>
<LD>   Cingular, owned by SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp., is
the nation's second-largest wireless provider, with about 22 million
subscribers in California and 37 other states. Its operations are a
complex amalgam of 11 different regional brands. Cingular has a large
presence in California because it includes the operations of the old
Pacific Bell Wireless.</LD>
<TE>   If the talks result in a deal, a combined Cingular and Voice-
Stream would challenge Verizon Wireless for the top spot in the
industry. Cingular and VoiceStream have 30.2 million customers
combined; Verizon has 30.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The talks between Cingular and VoiceStream, the nation's
sixth-largest wireless provider, come on the heels of negotiations
between VoiceStream and AT&amp;T Wireless in July and talks between
Cingular and AT&amp;T Wireless in April.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Cingular declined to comment Tuesday. A VoiceStream
spokeswoman did not return a call.</TE>
<TE>   For more than six months, analysts have said the U.S. mobile-phone
industry is on the verge of a major shakeout that probably will
reduce the number of providers from six to three or four in major
cities. Many of the national providers are carrying heavy debt loads
because of the huge investments made to build and then upgrade their
respective networks.</TE>
<TE>   After several years of record subscriber growth, U.S. companies
now face slower growth and price competition from up to five
competitors in major cities. Analysts say that is a recipe for
consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an overcrowded market.... I think everybody is talking
to everybody else right now [about mergers]," said Zach Wagner, a
wireless services analyst at Edward Jones. "We won't see anything
tomorrow, but I think in the next six to 12 months we'll see at least
one deal and that will probably lead to others."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the focus has been on potential deals involving Cingular,
VoiceStream and AT&amp;T Wireless because those three companies either
use or have committed to using the same core technology, making their
networks easier to integrate.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, VoiceStream is owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom,
which is under pressure to sell assets to pay down its massive debt.
The company has hired J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs to advise the
company on its U.S. strategy, and European experts have said
VoiceStream would be a likely candidate for divestiture.</TE>
<TE>   Cingular and VoiceStream are considered a good fit because
Cingular needs additional wireless spectrum in markets where it
doesn't have its own network, and in cities where the growing volume
of customer calls is stretching capacity. VoiceStream, a relative
newcomer, has extra spectrum and fewer customers and could fill
Cingular's coverage gaps in Indianapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia and
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche's U.S.-listed shares gained 1 cent to $11.52 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Shares of Texas-based SBC and
BellSouth both fell on the NYSE, with SBC falling $2.19, or 7%, to
$27.68; BellSouth lost $1.21, or 4.5%, to $25.50.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless slipped 11 cents, or 2%, to $5.06 on the NYSE.
Verizon Wireless and Cingular do not trade publicly. SBC owns 60% of
Cingular; BellSouth owns 40%.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies already share their networks in key markets
under a deal struck in November 2000, allowing Cingular to use
VoiceStream's network in St. Louis, Detroit and the New York City
region, and allowing VoiceStream to piggy-back on Cingular's network
in California and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Cingular, with backing from two relatively healthy
phone companies, is more likely to approve a deal that includes some
amount of cash--which is what Deutsche Telekom wants most.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Deutsche paid dearly for VoiceStream--about $29
billion--and might get only $10 billion to $15 billion for the unit
now, analysts said. For that reason, Deutsche may opt to sell only a
portion of VoiceStream and keep a small ownership stake to give
itself some gains once the market stabilizes, according to Wagner at
Edward Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Those and other factors have led analysts to believe that the
major players are engaged in a game of merger musical chairs, with
companies posturing and evaluating all the possible outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner and others say the first two deals will be the easiest to
get past regulators, and that also could help determine the ground
rules for future deals among the remaining players.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators, who recently revoked formal limits on spectrum
ownership, are likely to look favorably on some consolidation in the
industry, but not too much, according to Anna-Maria Kovacs of
Commerce Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "It is likely that even a merger between two of the top four
wireless players would pass muster as long as it took the market from
six to five players," Kovacs wrote Tuesday in a research report.
"Subsequent deals, however, would become more difficult from an
antitrust perspective, because each deal raises industry
concentration."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators also may be more cautious about wireless deals that
involve purchases by wireless carriers with ties to regional local
phone companies--such as Cingular and Verizon Wireless.</TE>
<TE>   With mobile phones emerging as a viable competitor to local phone
lines, regulators might worry that a wireless market dominated by
companies owned by large local phone companies "would lessen the
ability of the wireless market to impose discipline on local wireline
pricing," Kovacs said in her report.</TE>

<HD>CEO of Clear Channel's Radio Unit Signals Cooperation</HD>
<DH>Media: John Hogan pledges a better working relationship
with his competitors and the record industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Hogan, named Tuesday as chief executive of Clear Channel
Communication Inc.'s huge radio station division, pledged to soothe
tensions that flared up as his company rapidly took control of the
radio and concert industries in an unprecedented consolidation.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the biggest change people can expect is, we will have a
more collaborative, more cooperative attitude with our competitors
inside the radio industry and we will be more open with the record
industry and recording artists," said Hogan, who will oversee the
conglomerate's 1,200-station radio division.</LD>
<LD>   Hogan takes the helm as the parent company, Clear Channel, remains
under fire for allegedly engaging in anti-competitive practices,
including leveraging its giant portfolio of stations and concert
venues to prevent artists from appearing at rivals' stations or
concerts, and skirting anti-payola laws.</LD>
<TE>   He succeeds Randy Michaels, an outspoken supporter of radio
consolidation who sometimes crossed swords with competitors and major
record labels over Clear Channel's initiatives. Michaels abruptly
stepped aside last month to head a newly formed Clear Channel think
tank dealing with wireless and broadband technology.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan also said Tuesday that he would discontinue the radio
division's use of Radioactive, a private company owned by Michaels.
Through Radioactive, Michaels billed Clear Channel when company
executives flew aboard his privately owned plane. Last year, Clear
Channel paid Radioactive about $447,100 for "consulting and
transportation"--an amount approaching Michaels' base salary of
$506,471.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be flying commercial," Hogan said.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels' fate remains unclear. In its news release touting
Hogan's appointment Tuesday, Clear Channel made no mention of
Michaels, Hogan's former boss, who is credited with carrying out the
company's acquisition strategy and developing national music formats
for its local stations. Michaels could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel President Mark Mays said he selected Hogan for the
job because "he was the current leader of the company, he was
perceived that way, and it became an easy decision." Mays said "there
is no [more] important decision for the company in the next five
years" than picking Hogan as chief of the company's $3-billion-a-year
radio operation, its biggest division.</TE>
<TE>   The selection comes as Mays is keeping closer watch on the radio
operation, which is based in Covington, Ky. Hogan and the radio
division's chief financial officer, Jerry Kersting, are expected to
relocate to Clear Channel's corporate headquarters in San Antonio.
Insiders predict that Hogan probably will move his top programming
deputies there, although he said no final decision has been made.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan comes into the job as Clear Channel continues to wrestle
with the task of integrating the diverse properties it acquired in a
series of multibillion-dollar acquisitions after a landmark 1996
radio deregulation law.</TE>
<TE>   For example, although the firm has broken down management of its
advertising and programming divisions by specific regions, the
structure is considered inefficient because the ad and programming
units don't always cover the same territory.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Clear Channel were up 16 cents to $32.66 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Continental to Cut Flights, Charge Fees on Low-Fare Tickets</HD>
<DH>Airlines: The carrier says it does not plan any layoffs as
it announces 'some aggressive belt tightening' to stem losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY FIEWEGER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Continental Airlines Inc. said Tuesday that it will cut flights, park
aircraft and charge low-fare customers new fees in an effort to stem
financial losses since the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Continental, the No. 5 U.S. airline, said it will provide 17%
fewer seats on domestic flights by August 2003 compared with August
2001. Capacity will be reduced by 4% over the next year.</LD>
<LD>   The actions follow a decision last week by AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines, the world's largest airline, to cut 7,000 jobs, retire
aircraft and make schedule changes. Other carriers also are reducing
their winter flight schedules beyond the normal seasonal reductions.</LD>
<TE>   Continental said details of service and fee changes will be
unveiled over the next several weeks. "These changes enable customers
to select the products and services they value and are willing to pay
for," the airline said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based Continental rose 73 cents on the news, or
nearly 9%, to $9.10, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "These are challenging times in our industry and we need to do
something now," said Chairman and Chief Executive Gordon Bethune. "US
Airways declared bankruptcy and United is likely to follow soon.
American is eliminating 7,000 jobs. While we remain committed to
running a clean, safe and reliable operation, we need to do some
aggressive belt tightening so we don't end up like them."</TE>
<TE>   Continental, which was twice in Bankruptcy Court in the 1990s,
said it is making more than 100 changes, which include adding a $20
fee for all domestic paper tickets, eliminating discounts on certain
low-fare categories, and rigidly enforcing fare rules.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier announced no layoffs, saying it "hopes to avoid
additional furloughs" through a hiring freeze, retirements, voluntary
leaves and attrition.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways Group Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
Aug. 11. UAL Corp.'s United warned last week it may have to do the
same this fall unless it can cut its costs sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Like other major airlines, Continental has been losing money since
the attacks as traffic and fares remain low. In the second quarter,
it lost $139 million.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said it will remove an additional 11 MD-80 aircraft
from its schedule by the end of 2003, after having grounded 48 jets
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The moves are expected to generate pretax gains of about $80
million for the rest of the year and $350 million annually once fully
in place, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Home Depot Beats Estimates on Cost Cuts, Sales</HD>
<DH>Retail: The company reports a 28% rise in profit. Ross
Stores posts a 40% jump in income. Saks' loss narrows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc. on Tuesday reported a sharper-than-expected 28%
increase in fiscal second-quarter earnings as it cut store expenses
and sold more appliances and other big-ticket items.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest home improvement retailer also said it was
comfortable with Wall Street estimates for higher profit in the
current quarter and full year.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Robert Nardelli is paring inventory, centralizing
purchasing and slowing expansion to bolster profit as Home Depot
faces increased competition from smaller rival Lowe's Cos.</LD>
<TE>   Retailers have been watching costs, concerned sales may slow as
the U.S. economic recovery falters, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based Home Depot reported net income of $1.18 billion, or
50 cents a share, for the quarter ended Aug. 4, up from $924 million,
or 39 cents, a year earlier, on a 12% rise in revenue to $16.3
billion. Analysts on average were expecting 47 cents a share,
according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot has lost some investor favor as Lowe's, of Wilkesboro,
N.C., has reported profit increases outstripping those of the
industry leader.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lowe's posted a 42% rise in fiscal second-quarter
earnings. Lowe's is giving Home Depot more competition as it opens
stores in lucrative markets such as the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot's sales at stores open at least a year were up just 1%
in the quarter, trailing Lowe's 6.8% increase in same-store sales and
Home Depot's own forecast for a rise of 2% to 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot's chief financial officer, Carol Tome, said the quarter
was a "tough selling environment" affected by poor weather, falling
lumber prices and low consumer confidence. Cannibalization, which
occurs when newer Home Depot stores take sales from older ones in the
same market, and vendor changes also hurt same-store sales, Tome
said.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot reiterated that it expects to reach its goals of 15% to
18% annual revenue growth and 18% to 20% annual profit growth through
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The company's year forecast suggests that it would post
fourth-quarter profit of 31 cents a share, below the current First
Call analyst consensus of 34 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot shares rose $1.22 to $30.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other retail industry earnings reports Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Ross Stores Inc. said net income climbed 40% to $49.7 million,
or 62 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter as the discount
retailer of apparel and household items added 17 stores. Sales surged
21% to $876.9 million, and same-store sales jumped 9%. Newark,
Calif.-based Ross said it also benefited by bringing in new
merchandise and controlling costs. The results matched analyst
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Saks Holdings Inc. said its fiscal second-quarter loss narrowed
to $20.4 million, or 14 cents a share, from $42.4 million, or 30
cents, a year earlier as inventory management and profit margins
improved. The results were much better than the 18-cent loss analysts
had expected. Sales were down 2.6% to $1.24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Staples Inc.'s fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 48% to $59.6
million, or 13 cents a share, a penny better than expectations, as
revenue rose 5% to $2.43 billion. But the office supplies retailer
said profit in the current quarter would be somewhat weaker than
analysts had forecast. It sees earnings of 22 cents to 24 cents,
compared with estimates of 23 cents to 25 cents.</TE>

<HD>Freedom's Board Said to Ask CEO to Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of Orange County Register parent company Freedom
Communications Inc., frustrated with the company's sluggish
performance, has asked its chief executive to step down, according to
several inside sources.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Wolgemuth, who has been CEO and president since October
1999 and before that led Freedom's now-shuttered magazine division,
is expected to resign or be fired at a special board meeting
scheduled for Thursday, the sources said. The timing is subject to
change, however.</LD>
<LD>   Freedom's board--dominated by members of the Hoiles family, which
owns Freedom--voted unanimously Aug. 13 to force Wolgemuth out if he
didn't voluntarily relinquish power, several people close to the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   "We need a stronger leader running this company, and change is
needed," an insider said. Sources said the board has been unhappy
with Wolgemuth's strategy to take Freedom into magazines and the
Internet--ventures that ended up losing millions of dollars. One of
the magazines, a joint venture fashion publication called Mode that
was directed at full-figured women, shut down in October.</TE>
<TE>   The board has yet to choose a successor but is expected to do so
soon, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolgemuth, 59, characterized news of his impending dismissal as a
rumor. He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   His fate was sealed at a meeting Aug. 10 and 11 of Hoiles family
shareholders, said three company insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "People wanted action and were beyond upset," said a source who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The privately held company, which owns 28 daily newspapers, 37
weeklies and eight television stations, last year had revenue of $760
million and a loss of $94 million amid a softening economy and a
nationwide advertising downturn, said insiders familiar with the
results. The financial results included $103 million in before-tax
write-offs for magazine, Internet and other losses.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles, a dissident shareholder who had pushed for the sale of
Freedom, had long opposed Wolgemuth. One of only two board members to
have voted against his ascent to the top spot in 1999, Hoiles thought
Wolgemuth lacked the newspaper experience to succeed at Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles, an 8.6% owner, maintains that Freedom has lost 25% of its
value in the last five to seven years because of mismanagement,
including Wolgemuth's.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment Tuesday, as did many of the other 12
Freedom directors.</TE>
<TE>   The move to oust Wolgemuth comes at a time of great upheaval at
Irvine-based Freedom, the nation's 12th-largest newspaper chain. Its
Orange County Register is a standard-bearer of libertarianism and is
the dominant newspaper in one of the nation's most politically
conservative counties.</TE>
<TE>   After much internal wrangling, the Hoiles family recently decided
against selling the company but voted to transfer ownership to the
fourth generation of shareholders, now in their 20s and 30s.</TE>
<TE>   Younger members of the Hoiles clan have begun discussions with
family-business expert Francois de Visscher on the best way to raise
capital to purchase the stock of shareholders wishing to cash out.</TE>
<TE>   To raise funds to buy out the third-generation shareholders, the
family could sell shares in the private equity market or to the
public, or sell part of the company, experts said. No transaction is
expected to be completed for six to 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Wolgemuth came to Freedom in 1995 after a career mostly in book
and magazine publishing.</TE>
<TE>   He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Taylor University in
Upland, Ind.</TE>

<HD>Gates Says Microsoft Won't Expense Options Unless Required</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said Tuesday that the technology
industry wouldn't see any dramatic hit to innovation if it were
forced to begin formally expensing the cost of stock options given to
employees.</LD>
<LD>   Just the same, he said, the software giant had no plans to join
Coca-Cola Co., General Electric Co. and other blue chips in
voluntarily deducting options costs on the company's official income
statement.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think a change in the way the accounts are done would
have some major impact on technology," Gates said at a conference
here on innovation.</LD>
<TE>   "There's full disclosure," he said, referring to the current
requirement that companies footnote options expenses. "So it's hard
to think, 'Would that make some dramatic change in behavior?' " if
formal expensing of those costs were mandated.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors know the equation they're buying into," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gates said Microsoft would expense options if accounting
regulators ordered all companies to do so. But the firm's
unwillingness to begin expensing options voluntarily is based partly
on a desire for consistency in corporate reporting, he said. All
companies should follow the same expensing rules so investors can
compare bottom lines fairly, Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously our industry should move in a consistent way, because
otherwise you're not going to get any comparability between results,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In its latest earnings statement, Microsoft said reported profit
in the fiscal year ended June 30 would have been $5.08 billion
instead of $7.35 billion if it had to include options costs as an
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Though Microsoft is the world's biggest issuer of stock options in
absolute terms, it is under less pressure to issue them now than in
the late 1990s, when other companies eager to steal away the
company's employees were dangling large option grants, Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said in July that it will add 5,000 employees to its
work force of 50,500 in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Gates also said he didn't believe that options are as significant
an incentive as some believe. "I think it's an exaggeration to say
they line up the interests of the stockholder and the option holder."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell 96 cents to $51.04 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Malone Sees Value in Key Vivendi Assets</HD>
<DH>Media: Sources say the Liberty Media chairman wants to
merge his cable units with the company's entertainment arm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable television industry titan John Malone has plans for Universal
Studios that could create a new entertainment conglomerate--and
potentially make him a fortune. The challenge is whether he can
structure a deal that gives Vivendi Universal the cash it desperately
needs right now.</LD>
<LD>   Malone wants to marry the cable channels he controls through
Liberty Media Corp. with the Vivendi Universal Entertainment assets
run by his old friend Barry Diller, according to sources. Rolling up
the Starz Encore pay cable TV networks and the various Discovery
cable channels along with Universal Studios film, television and
theme parks--and possibly Universal Music--would create a new
entertainment behemoth that could be launched in an initial public
offering at a later, more opportune time.</LD>
<LD>   But for Vivendi, that time is now.</LD>
<TE>   With a pledge to begin selling off assets to raise $9.8 billion to
stem a liquidity crisis, Vivendi Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou is
looking for cash, not a long-term investment strategy.</TE>
<TE>   While a merger with Malone would allow Vivendi to salvage some
value for its Hollywood investments, it would take time to launch a
new company.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a quick way [for Vivendi] to raise cash," said Katherine
Styponias, media analyst with Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou has sent conflicting signals on whether Vivendi will
remain a global media company or revert to being a French water and
sewer company. That decision along with a range of options for
reducing debt and restructuring the company will be addressed at
Vivendi's board meeting next month.</TE>
<TE>   One option, a proposal from Haim Saban, Power Ranger impresario,
to buy Vivendi's 10% stake in the EchoStar satellite television
company along with its five still-unprogrammed channels on the
satellite system probably will be on the table, said people familiar
with Saban's bid.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility, a deal between DreamWorks SKG and Vivendi
Universal, was denied Tuesday by DreamWorks partner David Geffen, who
said his company had no interest in buying or investing in Vivendi's
U.S. entertainment assets.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not involved in any scenario to buy these assets, never
have been and never will be," Geffen said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Malone's gambit makes it off the table and onto the agenda
is yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Malone declined to be interviewed for this report and a spokesman
for Liberty Media declined to comment on the possible deal. Vivendi
declined to discuss potential deals involving Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   With Liberty Media holding a nearly 4% stake in Vivendi, it is
clear that Malone will be a player in whatever happens to Universal
Studios. He has a long history with Vivendi Universal Entertainment
Chairman Diller, investing in several of the Hollywood mogul's
previous ventures. Malone holds a 22% stake in Diller's other
company, USA Interactive, an e-commerce company that is a darling of
Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   And Malone has the financial clout to make things happen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic Malone: looking to pick up assets when they
might be up for sale under less than fortunate circumstances,"
Styponias said.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty's $4-billion net debt is more than offset by about $14
billion in investments in cable companies, she said, and the company
also has about $2 billion in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have estimated that Vivendi's U.S. entertainment assets,
including Universal Music Group, are worth $15 billion to $22
billion. Starz Encore and its 50% stake in the Discovery Channel are
worth an estimated $7 billion to $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Malone could end up with a 46% stake in the proposed new
entertainment concern, Styponias said, after contributing only about
a third of the assets: "It looks like a great deal for Liberty."</TE>
<TE>   Leveraging Malone's undervalued cable assets with Vivendi's
undervalued entertainment assets is a smart move, agreed Larry
Gerbrandt, chief content officer for Kagan World Media, a
Carmel-based media research firm. Liberty's and Vivendi's
entertainment businesses fit well strategically, he said, noting that
Starz Encore runs pay movie channels that could be an outlet for
Universal movies.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, having Malone as a major investor in the proposed new
company would raise the value of Vivendi's businesses and make its
assets more attractive to investors in a public offering.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very well regarded on Wall Street. They admire him for his
deal-making prowess and his discipline," Gerbrandt said.</TE>
<TE>   During the cable industry's early, high-octane growth years in the
1970s and 1980s, Malone earned a reputation as one of the media
industry's toughest deal makers as well as one of its savviest
investors. Wall Street investors learned to respect the man who built
Denver area-based cable operator Tele-Communications Inc., or TCI,
into a powerhouse that dominated the industry.</TE>
<TE>   When the reclusive Malone sold TCI to AT&amp;T Corp. for $46 billion
in 1999, his other company, Liberty Media, primarily a holding
company for television programming assets, became his investment
vehicle. Flush with billions of dollars in cash, Malone has been
trying to re-create his U.S. cable success in Europe's less mature
cable industry.</TE>
<TE>   That effort hasn't been going so smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "The European strategy depends on regulatory approvals. Some
people are masterful at handling politicians. John has utter distain
for the whole process," said one former Liberty executive.</TE>
<TE>   Although Liberty's balance sheet is healthy, the company's stock
price has suffered, in part because the company is a major holder in
AOL Time Warner Inc. and because of its cable investments in Europe.
Like the U.S. telecom business, the European cable business is
reeling. Many cable operators borrowed too much and relied on
excessively optimistic revenue projections.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late 1990s, there was an incredible mystique surrounding
Liberty Media. A lot of that mystique is now gone and investors are
looking a little more soberly at the business," said Paul Kim, an
analyst with Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about a deal involving Vivendi and Malone comes as
Vivendi has announced plans to unload Boston publisher Houghton
Mifflin and non-core assets of European pay TV company Canal Plus as
it struggles to deal with more than $19 billion in media-related
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares plummeted 45% last week after credit rating
companies cut their ratings amid concerns over the company's cash
crisis. On Tuesday, the stock rose 5.3% to $12.56 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Liberty Media rose 52 cents, or about 6%, to $19.15,
also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter intended to assure shareholders Monday, Fourtou said
the company was "on the verge of default" when he took over from
former CEO Jean Marie Messier last month, but is negotiating $3
billion in short-term financing.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Vivendi Environnement's bond holders agreed to
further distance the unit from its parent firm by agreeing to release
the utility from its obligation to buy out bonds if Vivendi Universal
defaulted on its own borrowings.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Retreat as Investors Cash Out</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The major indexes take a breather after two
weeks of gains, but some analysts see resilience. Oil prices continue
to surge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A burst of profit taking sent stocks lower Tuesday as investors
cashed in some of their winnings after two weeks of sizable gains.
The Dow Jones industrials fell nearly 119 points.</LD>
<LD>   "The market seems a little tired," said Michael Murphy, head
trader at Wachovia Securities. "We've had a pretty good mood the last
eight days. So some sort of pullback or digestion of the recent gains
would be in order."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, yields on Treasury securities had their biggest one-day
drop in three weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow closed down 118.72 points, or 1.3%, at 8,872.07, giving up
more than half of Monday's 213-point advance.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also was lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell
17.95 points, or 1.3%, to 1,376.59, after a 2.5% rise Monday. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index declined 13.27 points, or 1.4%, to
937.43.</TE>
<TE>   About three stocks fell for every two that rose on Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange, but the losses were more lopsided among
blue-chip shares. All but three of the 30 Dow members fell, while 402
members of the S&amp;P 500 fell and only 90 gained. Trading volume was
modest, following the pattern of recent sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Investors decided to cash out some gains after the S&amp;P 500 rose 9%
in about one month after a sell-off in the spring and summer that
sent stocks to levels not seen since mid-1997.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has moved up 1,500 points in a very short period of
time, so we are in for a breathing spell," said Alan Ackerman, market
strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co., referring to the Dow. "Techs,
telecoms and financials are under some profit-taking pressure, but on
balance the market continues to show remarkable resilience."</TE>
<TE>   He said that among factors pressuring the market was the
uncertainty over whether the United States was planning to strike
Iraq. Oil prices rose to $30.11 a barrel Tuesday, the highest price
in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The market also was pressured by news that about 70 people were
being decontaminated in McAllen, Texas, after they were exposed to an
unidentified white powder sent to a Hotels.com office. The powder
turned out not to be hazardous, a fire department spokesman said
later.</TE>
<TE>   "The market traded down a little on the fear that it could be
something like anthrax," said Brian Pears, head of equity trading at
Victory Capital Management. "It's quiet and we will be subject to
rumors and seemingly unimportant stories that still impact the
market." Hotels.com shares fell $1.25 to $44.19.</TE>
<TE>   The incident gave a further downward push to Treasury yields,
which already were falling as the stock market's decline renewed
speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to
revive economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the most actively traded two-year note fell to 2.07%
from 2.21% Monday, its biggest one-day slide since July 31. The yield
on the benchmark 10-year T-note fell to 4.15% from 4.28%.</TE>
<TE>   "A weaker stock market would pressure the consumer to spend less
money, forcing the [Fed] to cut interest rates," said Michael Cheah,
investment manager at Sun America Asset Management. "That's good for
Treasuries."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar rose against the yen and slipped against the euro. Gold
futures rose $2.70 to $308.70 an ounce in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of SBC Communications, BellSouth and Verizon
Communications fell after UBS Warburg downgraded the stocks and cut
their earnings and price targets. SBC, a Dow component, fell $2.19 to
$27.68; BellSouth fell $1.21 to $25.50; and Verizon lost $1.79 to
$31.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Cisco Systems, the No. 1 maker of equipment that directs
Internet traffic, said it will buy Andiamo Systems Inc., in a deal
that puts it in direct competition in the storage switch market with
Brocade Communications Systems and McData. Brocade shares slipped 44
cents to $15.74 and McData shares lost 21 cents to $10.15, while
Cisco shares inched up a penny to $14.73.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of Agilent Technologies lost $1.24 at $16.20, or 7%. The
electronics and testing equipment maker reported a steep quarterly
loss Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * Qwest Communications International gained 71 cents to $2.95, or
almost 32%, after it agreed to sell its directory publishing
business, QwestDex, to two private investment funds for $7.05
billion. The deal would give the troubled telephone company some
much-needed cash as it attempts to work through several regulatory
and financial concerns.</TE>
<TE>   * Household International shares fell on news that Washington
state prosecutors are working with other U.S. states to investigate
possible lending abuses by the No. 2 U.S. consumer finance company.
Household, which declined to comment, skidded $1 to $36.75.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Turns Over Data to Panel</HD>
<DH>Probe: Despite her compliance with the congressional
request, she still could be ordered to testify about ImClone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart on Tuesday turned over about 1,000 pages of e-mail
notes, phone records and other documents to a congressional panel
investigating whether she had inside information when she sold shares
of ImClone Systems Inc. or had obstructed the government's
examination of the sale.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been
investigating allegations of insider trading of ImClone stock last
year, had said they would subpoena the records--and possibly Stewart
herself--if they did not receive the documents by Tuesday. The
committee did not immediately make the documents available.</LD>
<LD>   "Our investigators have thumbed through the documents, trying to
make certain she has provided us with everything we have requested,"
said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House committee. "There's a lot
there. There are e-mails and a ton of records of phone calls. In many
cases, we're literally going to have to pick up the phone and see who
is on the other end."</LD>
<TE>   The investigators already have questions about some of the
documents, which had portions that were blocked out, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her attorneys have since explained to us that the documents in
question contained financial information not related to ImClone--in
other words proprietary information," Johnson said. "We've asked her
lawyers to bring in the originals this week so we can verify that."</TE>
<TE>   The documents were turned over in response to the committee's
second request for information from Stewart, who has not been charged
with a crime and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Although Stewart had forwarded a series of records in June, House
investigators later said they found inconsistencies between Stewart's
comments and those of other witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving her the opportunity to put her best foot forward and
provide us with as much information as possible and clear up the
inconsistencies in her story," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart sold nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone on Dec. 27, a day
before the Food and Drug Administration said it would deny approval
of the company's Erbitux cancer drug. ImClone shares plummeted on the
FDA announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Although Stewart was a close friend of former ImClone Chief
Executive Samuel D. Waksal--who since has been charged with trying to
sell ImClone stock before the FDA's announcement and alerting family
members to do likewise--Stewart has said she sold because of a
preexisting arrangement with her Merrill Lynch broker to sell if
ImClone shares dipped below $60, as they did that day.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing documents from Merrill Lynch, the panel so far has
not found evidence of such a "stop-loss" agreement, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Even after complying with the document request, Stewart, who has
declined to talk privately with congressional investigators, still
faces the possibility of being ordered to testify on Capitol Hill,
committee members said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the panel's oversight
subcommittee, told CNN the committee "probably will need to subpoena
her" to appear before the panel, a decision that probably will be
made around Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any great heart to drag her before the committee for
a media circus," Greenwood said. "On the other hand, just because
you're rich and famous doesn't mean that you get treated specially."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia got a boost Tuesday from
the news of Stewart's compliance and rose 91 cents to $9.05 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The company has lost about half of its
market value since news of Stewart's alleged involvement in the
scandal surfaced in June.</TE>

<HD>Tactics Toughen on Music Piracy</HD>
<DH>Internet: The recording industry is seeking to block access
to a foreign site and is going after individual customers of service
providers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As online pirates move offshore, the music industry is adopting
aggressive strategies that include suing the Internet backbone
providers to block Web sites that offer illegal downloads and
demanding the names of customers from service providers.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest such maneuver, the Recording Industry Assn. of
America sought a federal court order Tuesday compelling Verizon
Communications Inc. to reveal the name of a customer allegedly
trading hundreds of pirated songs. And in a lawsuit filed Friday, the
RIAA asked for an injunction requiring four Internet backbone
providers--AT&amp;T Broadband, Sprint Corp., WorldCom Inc. subsidiary
UUNet Technologies Inc. and Cable &amp; Wireless--to cut off access to
Listen4Ever.com, a site hosted in China that offers illicit downloads
of entire albums, some of which have yet to be released in stores.</LD>
<LD>   The actions are unprecedented for the music industry, which has
labored with little success to stamp out piracy and now is employing
increasingly tough tactics.</LD>
<TE>   "They've never gone after a backbone provider before," said Matt
Jackson, assistant professor of telecommunications at Pennsylvania
State University. "If backbones shut down access, it's like shutting
down major roads into the United States."</TE>
<TE>   By taking aim at the backbone providers, the music industry is
trying to force them to take a greater role in policing the data that
moves across their networks. And by targeting individuals suspected
of uploading copyrighted songs rather than just shutting down host
sites, the industry is trying to show pirates that they can be
tracked.</TE>
<TE>   The music industry has typically worked with Internet service
providers to take down offending sites without resorting to the court
system. But because Listen4Ever.com is hosted in China, the site
cannot be shut down from the U.S. Some pirate sites have set up in
other countries to avoid the reach of U.S. copyright law. Sources
said the RIAA tried to solicit the help of Chinese officials but was
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   So the industry is trying to enlist backbone providers, which own
the data freeways over which much of the Internet's traffic flows, to
block access to a site, something it has never done before. Most of
North America's Internet traffic eventually flows through UUNet,
AT&amp;T, Sprint or Cable &amp; Wireless, owners of the country's four
largest backbones, said David Farber, professor of telecommunications
at the University of Pennsylvania. Any traffic intended for a blocked
site that hit these backbones could easily and instantly be diverted.</TE>
<TE>   That worries some scholars. "The concern is that the people who
run these sites may never get their day in court," said Mark Lemley,
professor of intellectual property law at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Verizon case and the RIAA's suit against the backbone
providers are based on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998
law that updated copyright rules for the electronic age. Critics
complain that the law grants copyright holders too much power.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA's lawyer, Matthew Oppenheim, said suing the companies
that run the Internet backbone is a drastic step.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rare situation when we can't deal with the problem more
directly," he said. "We view this as a last-ditch effort."</TE>
<TE>   The effort may not get its day in court. Listen4Ever.com's site
went down over the weekend, but not through any actions by the
backbone providers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the site remains down, we will dismiss our case in the next
few days," Oppenheim said.</TE>
<TE>   That would please backbone providers, none of whom would comment.
But industry executives who declined to be identified said they were
not eager to jump into the role of policing the Internet and
regulating content.</TE>
<TE>   "This opens up a huge can of worms for them," said Gartner Inc.
analyst P.J. McNealy. "They are merely the middleman here, and
they're looking for legal protection."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon gave a glimpse of the potential struggle ahead when it
refused to comply with a July 24 subpoena requesting the identity of
a customer allegedly trafficking pirated songs. The RIAA filed a
motion Tuesday asking a federal judge to enforce the subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the subpoena is not valid since [the songs] are not
stored on our network," said Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman. "While
we think copyright owners have a right to their property, we also
think customers have privacy rights that should also be maintained."</TE>

<HD>Crude Oil Supplies Up; Futures Decline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil futures fell in after-hours trading Tuesday after the
American Petroleum Institute reported the first increase in U.S.
inventories in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Supplies rose 6.6 million barrels, or 2.3%, to 302.3 million
barrels, the institute said in a weekly report. Analysts had been
divided on whether the report would show supplies higher or lower.
Last week's report showed the biggest decline in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   "Crude oil stockpiles have rallied back above year-ago levels,"
said Phil Flynn, vice president and senior market analyst at Alaron
Trading Corp. in Chicago. The "surplus in crude signals that things
might not be as tight we thought."</LD>
<TE>   Crude oil for October delivery was down 39 cents at $28.38 a
barrel in evening trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The September crude contract reached an 18-month high of $30.11 a
barrel before it expired at the end of the regular trading session
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have strengthened steadily on fears of potential supply
disruption in the Middle East, home to two-thirds of world oil
reserves, as Washington considers military action to oust Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has held its
official production at the lowest level for a decade this year,
helping to push crude prices up almost 50% despite sluggish fuel
demand.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in inventories reported by the API was the biggest
since the week ended April 26. Most of the rise, 5.3 million barrels,
occurred on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the nation's refining and importing
heartland. The drop of 9.5 million barrels reported last week was the
biggest decline since June 2001 and included a drop of 6.1 million
barrels in the Gulf region.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts who were surprised by the size of last week's
stockpile plunge expected a correspondingly large rise this week.</TE>
<TE>   The API also reported that inventories of gasoline rose
unexpectedly, increasing by 935,000 barrels to 209.9 million barrels.
Analysts had forecast a decline of 800,000 to 1.3 million barrels.
Supplies were up 3.4% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline futures for September delivery were down 1.23 cents at
78.8 cents a gallon in after-hours trading in New York.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Opposes Order to Pull Paxil TV Ads</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The Justice Department asks judge to reconsider
ruling that hits 'not habit-forming' claim. FDA protests court's
involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to reconsider an
order that GlaxoSmithKline pull all television ads that claim that
one of the company's bestselling drugs is not habit-forming, even
though the ads had satisfied the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The order by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer of Los Angeles,
issued late Friday, was directed at GlaxoSmithKline's anti-depression
drug Paxil, which accounted for more than $2 billion in sales in
2001. Pfaelzer ruled that television ads for the drug were misleading
in that they discounted the severity of withdrawal symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in a lawsuit that was filed a year ago on behalf
of 35 patients who said they suffered severe withdrawal symptoms such
as nausea, fever and so-called electric zaps to their bodies once
they stopped taking Paxil. It would be effective Sept. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA and lawyers for both sides said they had never heard of a
judge banning ads that had been approved by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   In its request to Pfaelzer on Tuesday, the Justice Department
argued that the FDA had the regulatory responsibility to police drug
advertisements. Justice attorneys said Pfaelzer's ruling sets up a
potential conflict between the FDA and federal courts over who can
regulate drug advertising. The FDA also issued a protest of the
ruling Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline also said that the order was improper and that it
would appeal, although the company did not say what it planned to do
about its ad campaign in the short term. The company already has
produced a Paxil ad that avoids the claim that the drug is not
habit-forming.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling stands, experts said it could have a serious effect
on the pharmaceutical industry's $2.5-billion direct-to-consumer
marketing campaigns, which potentially would have to pass muster with
judges around the country.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline and the FDA viewed the judge's ruling as a direct
assault on the federal regulatory system in which the FDA, and not
the courts, has final say on whether print and broadcast
advertisements are truthful and accurate. It's the FDA that has "the
expertise and responsibility for reviewing and regulating
pharmaceutical ads," said David Stout, GlaxoSmithKline's U.S.
president of pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA issued a statement arguing that the ad ban was
"improvidently entered" and contrary to the agency's regulatory role.
An FDA official added that the agency had received copies of
GlaxoSmithKline's advertisement and offered suggestions on it,
maintaining that the judge had overreacted to the "not habit-forming"
claim and had taken it out of context. The FDA argued that the matter
should be referred to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Pfaelzer has made controversial decisions before: Her ruling in
1997 that California's Proposition 187 was unconstitutional killed an
initiative, approved by nearly 60% of state voters, that would have
denied public education, social services and nonemergency health care
to illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has much stronger and direct authority over drug labels,
which must past agency standards before they are released. The FDA
has no authority to demand prior approval before an ad goes out, but
says its clout with the industry prevents abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Not in this case, argued the plaintiff's attorney, Karen Barth,
who said that although the company changed its label late last year,
it continued to run commercials and distribute brochures saying Paxil
"may cause mild, usually temporary side effects in some individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Barth and doctors who supported her case argued that the symptoms
were severe and debilitating and occurred regardless of how long the
patient had been on Paxil.</TE>
<TE>   "Paxil gives patients much more severe and prolonged problems than
they came in with, and those people were assured that there would be
no serious problems," said Dr. Stuart Shipko of Pasadena, one of the
plaintiff's experts.</TE>
<TE>   One plaintiff, Sandra Clark, 52, of Louisville, Ky., said the
flu-like symptoms and nausea were so severe that they were worse than
morning sickness during pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said she was on a 40-milligram-a-day dose of Paxil beginning
in January 2000 and began suffering symptoms a year later once she
had slowly tapered down to 10 milligrams. She said she was not
Paxil-free for six more months, until June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't drive. I had sensory problems and I needed a
caretaker," she said, adding that she decided to become a plaintiff
in the hope "that no one else will have to go though this. To lose a
year of your life is just unreal."</TE>
<TE>   Glaxo's own physician experts argued that the symptoms were not
severe and typical of withdrawal from other drugs in the class, known
as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   Those SSRIs that break down in the body more quickly tend to have
the most severe reactions in some patients.</TE>
<TE>   The experts said it was misleading to emphasize the term
"habit-forming" on a drug as if it were something that patients
maintained a craving for once they stopped using it.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline shares declined $1.41 to $40.59 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   SEC Says 16 Companies Failed to Certify Results</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission said its staff has finished
processing the 691 certifications of corporate financial results that
were due by Aug. 14, finding just 16--or 2.3%--that weren't able to
sign off on their previous quarterly and annual numbers.</LD>
<TE>   Companies that weren't able to certify results were: ACT

Consolidated Freightways Corp., Dynegy Inc., Enron Corp., Gemstar-TV
Guide International Inc., Hercules Inc., LTV Corp., McLeod USA Inc.,
Mirant Corp., Qwest Communications International Inc., TruServ Corp.,
and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Only one company, IT Group Inc., which is in bankruptcy
liquidation, failed to file the certification by the Aug. 14 deadline
or request an extension. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on what
action the agency might take against the firm.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the SEC ordered top executives at 947 of the nation's
largest companies to certify under oath that the results they file to
the agency are accurate.</TE>

<TE>   Request for Ad Claim</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. has withdrawn a request asking the
government to say whether it is OK to state in ads that its products
are safer than cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the agency last week, the nation's largest maker of
moist snuff said it does not want the Federal Trade Commission to
weigh in now because new information is likely to emerge from two
tobacco conferences scheduled for September and October in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Some health advocates say the company was worried the agency would
disallow the claims.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. surgeon general issued a report in 1986 saying smokeless
tobacco products can cause cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Congress subsequently passed a law stating that such products must
be sold with health warnings.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Smokeless is a subsidiary of UST Inc. UST's shares fell 59

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. has withdrawn a request asking the
government to say whether it is OK to state in ads that its products
are safer than cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the agency last week, the nation's largest maker of
moist snuff said it does not want the Federal Trade Commission to
weigh in now because new information is likely to emerge from two
tobacco conferences scheduled for September and October in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Some health advocates say the company was worried the agency would
disallow the claims.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. surgeon general issued a report in 1986 saying smokeless
tobacco products can cause cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Congress subsequently passed a law stating that such products must
be sold with health warnings.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Smokeless is a subsidiary of UST Inc. UST's shares fell 59
cents to $33.37 on the NYSE. Its leading brands are Copenhagen and
Skoal.</TE>

<LD>BMW recalled 20,500 more of its 1999-model 323i and 328i sedans
because side air bags may inflate unexpectedly and cause head
injuries, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.</LD>
<LD>   The air bags might deploy if the car hits a large pothole or is
struck with force that wouldn't cause significant damage, according
to the government agency.</LD>
<LD>   "A small number of minor abrasions and bruises" have been reported
as a result of unexpected deployments, a BMW spokesman said.</LD>

<LD>EBay Inc.'s $1.5-billion purchase of online payment service PayPal
Inc. was cleared by antitrust regulators, eliminating a potential
barrier to the transaction.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department ended its review without asking for more
information, said EBay, the largest Internet auctioneer.</LD>

$2.10, or 10%, to $23.10 and EBay fell $1.45 to $60.41.</LD>
<TE>   PayPal's competitors include a smaller service operated by EBay.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal, which lets users make payments electronically from banks

<HD>Back-to-School Sales Disappoint</HD>
<DH>Retail: Even some big players report dreary figures,
raising doubts about a comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sluggish back-to-school sales--blamed on a wobbly economy, weird
weather and too few fashion must-haves--are draining hopes that
apparel retailers will make a big comeback in the second half of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   Chain store sales rose just 1.8% last week, the slowest
year-over-year gain since Jan. 5, according to a report released
Tuesday by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. Compared with the previous
week, sales dropped a hefty 0.8%.</LD>
<LD>   Disappointing numbers are dribbling in from some of retail's
biggest players, including Federated Department Stores Inc., Sears
Roebuck &amp; Co. and even industry giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "The economy is very bumpy ... and there's a lot of uncertainty
over all the turbulence in the stock market," said Michael Baker,
research director for the International Council of Shopping Centers
in New York. "Consumers are playing wait-and-see at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Economic uncertainty also has caused retailers to keep inventories
lean, which helps profits but makes it less probable that companies
can boost sales later by marking down excess merchandise as they did
last year, Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   "Under those circumstances, you're not going to see a rapid
pick-up in sales," Baker said. "This is something that is going to
carry through into the holiday season, I'm afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Weather is taking part of the blame. Unusually sultry
temperatures, especially in the New England states, have made it hard
for consumers to get interested in fall fashions, the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi report said. In some areas of the nation, there was
more rain than usual last week, including in the central states that
stretch from Mexico to Canada. Along the Southern California coast,
surf shops, which are increasingly reliant on back-to-school sales,
are coping with unseasonable mist and drizzle.</TE>
<TE>   "It rained yesterday," Huntington Surf &amp; Sport owner Aaron Pai
said. "This time of the year, it just shuts everything down."</TE>
<TE>   But buyers turned out last weekend for the Huntington Beach
company's back-to-school sale, Pai said, boosting sales about 2% for
the annual three-day event.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of fashion freshness also is playing a part in the sluggish
back-to-school sales, some experts say. Low-rise pants have sparked
sales for women, and some companies hope that the style also will
catch on for men. But some retailers remain skeptical that males will
warm to the slinkier look.</TE>
<TE>   What teen apparel retailers long for is a shift in the fashion
silhouette that would create a gaping hole in the closets of teens,
which they would then have to fill, said Tim Harmon, president of
Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., an Anaheim retailer that caters
to surfers and skateboarders.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping, like everybody, to find a new driver in the men's
business," he said. "All of our competitors are looking for a new
trend for all of us to capitalize on."</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, strong sellers at PacSun stores include jeans, striped
knit shirts and hooded sweatshirts and sweaters.</TE>
<TE>   In other gloomy retail news released Tuesday, Instinet's Redbook
Retail Sales Average slipped 1.5% in the two weeks ended Aug. 17
compared with the same period in the previous month. With only one or
two exceptions, Redbook's entire retail group reported
slower-than-expected sales for the first half of August. J.C. Penney
Co. offered a bright spot, saying sales so far in August were
tracking above expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Back-to-school sales generally have lagged plan," Redbook
researchers reported. "Given the current economic conditions, parents
are more cautious about spending. Kids are taking a more
value-oriented approach to their back-to-school shopping rather than
feeling the need to capture the latest trend."</TE>
<TE>   But even some high-profile discounters have lost some steam
recently. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer and usually among
its best performers, said Monday that August probably would be at the
lower end of its plan for 4% to 6% same-store sales growth.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Bloomingdale's and
Macy's, among others, said sales for the first two weeks of August
were "very disappointing." The company already had revised its
expectation for the month, saying sales would be in the 1% to 3%
growth range rather than the 3% to 3.5% the company previously had
forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Sears also said sales were slower than expected for the second
week of August. The company had anticipated a sales decline of close
to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   For their fiscal second quarter, some retailers offered relatively
brighter news Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzooks Inc., which sells clothes and accessories to teens,
reported earnings of $115,000, or a penny a share, for the quarter
ended Aug. 3, contrasted with a loss of $1.3 million, or 14 cents, in
the comparable period last year. The company's sales rose 5.6% to
$76.7 million. Sales at stores open a year or more, a key industry
indicator, declined 3.3%, compared with a decrease of 8.9% in the
second quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   Aeropostale Inc., another retailer that caters to teens, reported
Tuesday a loss of almost $2 million, or 6 cents a share, for the
quarter ended Aug. 3, compared with a loss of about $1.7 million, or
6 cents, a year earlier. The New York-based firm also said its sales
jumped 41% to $90.1 million as it netted 83 store openings.
Same-store sales rose 11.2% in the quarter.</TE>

<HD>June Trade Gap Narrows, but Import Demand Rises</HD>
<DH>Economy: U.S. exports post 1.7% increase from May.
California exports drop nearly 20% in first half from a year earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American demand for imported clothing, toys and electronics continued
to climb in June, pushing the trade gap to its second-highest monthly
tally, according to figures released Tuesday by the Commerce
Department.</LD>
<LD>   June's $37.2-billion trade deficit narrowed slightly from a record
$37.8 billion in May, thanks to increased U.S. exports. Still,
America's consumption of foreign-made goods reached a 15-month high
of $119.2 billion in June, capping a second quarter in which the U.S.
posted the three largest monthly trade deficits in its history.</LD>
<LD>   Through the first six months of the year, the United States bought
$206 billion more in goods and services from foreign nations than it
has sold abroad, putting it on pace to log its biggest-ever annual
trade deficit.</LD>
<TE>   While that is heightening concerns about U.S. trade policy,
economists say there is an upside to the widening trade gap.
Ballooning imports signal that American consumers are continuing to
spend, helping to prop up the U.S. economy as well as those around
the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest fear right now is that the economy will fall off a
cliff if American consumers hold back," said economist Rajeev Dhawan,
director of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center.
"But growing imports mean that demand is picking up, which is a
positive sign for the economy right now."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. exports in June posted a modest 1.7% increase from the
previous month. But despite a softening dollar that is making
American goods more affordable abroad, U.S. exports for the first
half of the year were $476.4 billion, down 8.9% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   A separate tally of state trade statistics showed California
exporters fared even worse. California exports plummeted nearly 20%
to $46.1 billion in the first half of 2002 compared with the same
period in 2001, led by continued steep declines in technology
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   California shipped $20.5 billion of computers and electronic
equipment in the first half of 2002, a plunge of nearly 26% from the
same period in 2001. Other big-ticket goods fell as well, with
machinery declining 27% to $4.6 billion and transportation equipment
down 25% to $3.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Economists are doubtful that spending on high-tech goods and other
capital equipment will rebound significantly this year, pointing to
continued weakness in California's export trade for the foreseeable
future.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still too much inventory out there, and demand is weak,"
said Steven G. Cochrane, chief regional economist for Economy.com
Inc. in West Chester, Pa. "It could be the middle of next year before
we see things pick up."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, California's exports have dropped so precipitously that
one system for measuring export data shows that the Golden State this
year has ceded its crown as the nation's largest exporting state to
longtime rival Texas.</TE>
<TE>   According to government trade data compiled by the Massachusetts
Institute for Social and Economic Research, Texas logged $46.3
billion of exports in the first half of the year, edging out
California for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say this "origin of movement" data has reporting
limitations that result in the inflation of exports from states with
major port facilities. The result, says Sacramento trade analyst Jock
O'Connell, is that Texas, a major gateway to Mexico and South
America, is credited as the source of exports that actually
originated in other states, including California.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the steep decline in high-tech exports, O'Connell said
there is "no question" that California, the world's fifth-largest
economy, remains the nation's top exporter. He said the steady climb
in U.S. imports this year probably reflects some concern from
retailers about the possibility of labor unrest at West Coast ports.
The contract covering 10,500 unionized dock workers at 29 ports
expired July 1, heightening concern about a potential strike or
slowdown. "Retailers have made a concerted effort to increase their
inventory ... to hedge against the possibility of a strike,"
O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those goods are coming from China, which posted a record
trade deficit of $8.5 billion with the U.S. in June, even though
American exports to that nation hit an all-time monthly high of $2.2
billion. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan increased 9% to $5.3
billion, while the gap with Canada, America's largest trading
partner, narrowed 18.9% to $3.4 billion. The U.S. trade deficit with
Mexico, its other partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement,
slipped 5% to $3.2 billion.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines Pilots Shelve Pay-Cut Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines' pilots union has shelved a vote on a proposed 10%
pay cut as the troubled carrier pushes for even bigger cutbacks and
cost savings in a bid to avoid a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   The 9,200 pilots had been scheduled to vote starting Tuesday on
whether to approve a tentative deal calling for the wage reduction
over three years, resulting in an estimated $520 million in savings.</LD>
<LD>   UAL Corp.'s United, which has been unable to gain concessions from
its other unions, cited the pilots' commitment in its June
application for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee it says is
needed to help it recover from financial struggles. But officials in
Washington have made it clear to the airline that the application
will be rejected without broader, deeper and longer-term cost
savings.</LD>
<TE>   The Air Line Pilots Assn. opted to postpone the vote indefinitely
while other proposals are reviewed, union spokesman Herb Hunter said.
"It makes no sense to vote on something that's not going to work," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative agreement reached two months ago, pilots would
have permitted United's express carriers to continue planned growth
of regional jet service. The pilots, who own 28% of the company, also
would have received stock options in UAL.</TE>
<TE>   Since the June 22 agreement, shares of Elk Grove Township,
Ill.-based UAL have lost more than 70% of their value. They dropped 7
cents to $3.22 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter declined to discuss what other proposals are under
consideration and said it shouldn't be assumed that the pilots union
would agree to steeper cuts.</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Joe Hopkins had no comment on the vote
postponement.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of the nation's No. 2 airline held meetings Tuesday
with representatives of the carrier's unions, sharing information
about costs, revenue and projections. Hopkins said he wasn't aware
whether they presented formal cost-saving proposals that Chief
Executive Jack Creighton said last week would be forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton warned Aug. 14 that United is preparing to file for
Bankruptcy Court protection this fall unless it succeeds in lowering

<HD>Full-Body Art Is Losing Its Luster in Modern Japan</HD>
<DH>Culture: All-over tattooing has long had adherents. But new
generations look at it askance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISEHARA, Japan</DL>
<LD>They cost as much as $20,000, hurt like you wouldn't believe and
virtually guarantee pariah status in proper Japanese society. So why
in the world would anyone seek such a thing? For those with full-body
tattoos, known as horimono, it's about inner satisfaction, a link
with centuries-old tradition and the chance to show you're a "real
man"--or woman.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, say followers of this ancient Japanese art, old
masters are dying off--and most young people aren't interested in
lengthy apprenticeships to learn a frowned-upon practice.</LD>
<LD>   "Fewer and fewer people nowadays are doing horimono," says Yoshiki
Nishiyama, a 53-year-old fish wholesaler who sports an elaborate
devil over his shoulder and down his arm. "Social bias is scaring
many people off."</LD>
<TE>   While tattoos in the West are often the result of an
alcohol-induced whim during adolescence, these costly Japanese
treasures take months, even years, to complete and are cherished for
a lifetime. Sometimes, they last even longer, as in the case of
several half-century-old tattooed specimens preserved for skin
research in a Tokyo University medical lab.</TE>
<TE>   Because Japanese bearing these living, breathing works of art are
shunned by mainstream society and barred from many pools and saunas,
most keep their artwork hidden from almost everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Muneo Uchino, 66, a retired plasterer, managed to conceal his skin
canvas from his bride for the first six months of their marriage half
a century ago by undressing in the dark and bathing in private.</TE>
<TE>   "She was shocked when she found out" about his tattoo of flowers,
waves and a large carp on his buttock, he says. "She's used to it
now, though."</TE>
<TE>   Voluntarily setting yourself apart from society takes courage in a
culture where the value of fitting in is instilled from childhood.
The bias faced by those bearing horimono, however, is eased by their
discretion and any feeling of isolation by the strong bonds that
develop in what sometimes approximates a secret society.</TE>
<TE>   The negative perception many Japanese have of horimono stems in
large part from their close identification with yakuza, or organized
crime groups.</TE>
<TE>   Many people with horimono decry this guilt by association, which
they attribute to decades of formulaic Japanese films that depicted
tattoo-clad gangsters committing dastardly deeds.</TE>
<TE>   And while yakuza often display their tattoos to intimidate their
victims--it's been said that simply rolling up a sleeve can be enough
to get money paid and trucks moving--real horimono wearers jealously
guard their secret beneath robes and other coverings, traditionalists
say.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate summer," says Katsutoshi Shimane, leader of the
101-year-old Edo Choyukai tattoo society. "Most of us don't have any
short-sleeve shirts, and it gets very hot."</TE>
<TE>   Even some yakuza members say using tattoos to scare people goes
against the long-standing spirit of Japanese full-body art.</TE>
<TE>   "Some may do that, but I think using it that way is shameful,"
says Mitsuo Naganuma, a 26-year-old crime-family member from Yokohama
with a warrior-and-tiger tattoo who just wrapped up a four-year
prison term on assault and drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cool reception tattoo bearers receive from many
ordinary Japanese, full-body art has been widely admired overseas for
decades, often transmitted on the backs, arms and thighs of sailors.
Britain's King George V, the grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II,
acquired a tattoo in the 1880s while on a port call to Japan with the
Royal Navy, according to Murray's 1891 Guide to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   While Western tattoos are often highly personal, even faddish,
with their bias toward ships, crosses, pinup girls, girlfriends and
the Marine Corps, full-body Japanese tattoos draw on centuries-old
Chinese folk tales or stories from Kabuki theater.</TE>
<TE>   Toshikatsu Mizushiro, 40, a flower shop manager, has chosen
various detailed floral themes derived from the classics. And Mikio
Kujirai, a small-business owner living in Tokyo, says he chose a
devil image from Noh drama to deter temptation.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. patterns aren't necessarily linked to history," says
Yoshihito Nakano, a fully tattooed master tattoo artist who practices
under the nom de ink Horiyoshi III and is one of the last
acknowledged masters. "You might even use Arnold Schwarzenegger. We
wouldn't even consider someone from the Taisho era"--80 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those with horimono are men, but Yoko Ashimine, 25, a
production worker at a Kabuki theater, is on her 10th session with
Horiyoshi III. She's chosen a theme from one of the Kabuki
productions she worked on.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I'm involved in a very traditional job, I saw the tattoo
tradition as a way to contribute to my work," she says. "No one at
work knows about it. It's just for me."</TE>
<TE>   Tattoo masters say there's been a recent rise in popularity of
small, American-style tattoos among young people in Japan, where 18
is the legal age for going under the needle. While a few go on to
receive a full-body treatment, enthusiasts say that social prejudice
is dampening its appeal and undermining the creed of loyalty, dignity
and discretion that traditionally bound this unique world.</TE>
<TE>   Tattooing has a long history in Japan. Tattoo-clad clay figures
have been found from the Jomon period, which lasted from 10,000 BC to
300 BC. Chinese texts record the Japanese practice as early as the
3rd century. Native Ainu tattooed mustache-like designs on their
daughters as a sign of virtue.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 17th century, tattoos were used to brand criminals--a
tradition borrowed from China. Repeated offenses earned more lines
and circles. Eventually, in some cases, the recidivists' markings
would form the Chinese character for dog--on their foreheads.</TE>
<TE>   Legend has it that full-body tattoos developed as a way to work
these criminal tags into something a bit more respectable. The
vibrant designs seen today can be traced to the first half of the
18th century, when Japan's elite samurai class started to stagnate
and commoners from present-day Tokyo developed their own culture,
arts and sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   During this period, some woodblock carvers branched out into
tattoo work as body art became increasingly popular among rickshaw
drivers, laborers and carpenters, some of their wives--and women of
ill repute. Most tattoo masters' working names start with "Hori,"
meaning "to carve."</TE>
<TE>   It was during this golden era of tattooing that tattoos became
associated with hard physical labor, tough muscular men with strong
community spirit, and bravery among volunteer firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "When they died in a blaze, their tattoos provided a way to
identify them," says Yohei Horikawa, a printer of old-style calling
cards popular with tattoo bearers.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 set Japan on a
rapid modernization course. The emerging bureaucratic class decided
that tattoos had no place in the new order and outlawed them in 1872.
The ban was lifted in 1948, but in recent decades, horimono
aficionados say, social pressure against them has intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Most full-body tattoos don't extend to the forearms or shins, and
a small bit of skin is left unmarked down the center of the chest and
belly. This allows their bearers to preserve their secret, should a
kimono open a little too far or a long-sleeve shirt inadvertently
edge up.</TE>
<TE>   Those with horimono tend to avoid public baths and hot springs. Go
Fukushima, a 30-year-old carpenter, sneaks away after work to dress
and wash separately from his colleagues. Laborer Michio Moriya says
he's never told his kids.</TE>
<TE>   Many festivals that once welcomed horimono wearers now discourage
them. Tattoo-holders say police sometimes blare warnings over
loudspeakers that everyone's shirt must stay on, to keep
tattoo-bearers in check.</TE>
<TE>   As in many traditional crafts, there's a strong apprenticeship
system. Clients often stay in touch with their tattoo artists
throughout their lifetimes and frequently share their innermost
thoughts the way Westerners might with a longtime family doctor.
Moriya, his back bedecked with carp, says he waited 30 years before
finding someone whose outlook he shared.</TE>
<TE>   Once a master agrees to take you on, it's a major commitment. The
full piece can take more than a year at a normal pace, involving
hundreds of hours. Clients pick designs from books, but the tattoo
master often takes the lead in deciding what pattern a client should
wear for the rest of his or her life.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, tattooed members of the Edo Choyukai association,
which is proud of its link to "the spirit of real men from Old
Tokyo," get together in the heat of summer for a pilgrimage to the
Oyama shrine on the outskirts of Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Trains have replaced footpaths, and cell phones ring incessantly
on the trip. But the mostly middle-aged men still strip down, don
loincloths and dive into a nearby waterfall, just as their
counterparts did 100 years ago. The snake-like trail of near-naked
colored men wends its way up the steep mountain, bodies undulating,
female figures gesturing over spindly muscles, snake figures twisting
and flowers glistening under dew-like beads of perspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The men ooh, ah and marvel at one another's skin art, exchange
stories and admire old photos. There's friendly competition between
those in favor of the traditional, labor-intensive hand tattooing
methods and those who prefer rapid-fire machine needle work, with its
more vibrant colors.</TE>
<TE>   One thing both camps agree on: The pain is searing, particularly
on the stomach and lower spine areas. But quiet suffering is also
part of the mystique, an initiation rite of sorts, forming a bond of
endurance.</TE>
<TE>   Tattoo artists generally start from the middle of the back and
expand with postcard-size blocks. Eventually, after many pricks,
pokes and blood splatters, the piece comes together. Those customers
who go only partway are known as "turtles" for their dark backs and
white underbellies. The top artists sign their work--but generally
only after the piece is finished, providing an incentive to get the
full treatment.</TE>
<TE>   As the shrine day wraps up, the men put their guards back up in
preparation for their return to society. Dragons, demons and maidens
retreat from the sun under shirts and trousers for another year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so used to hiding it. It's the equivalent of a very
valuable jewel for us," says Masahiro Itakura, a 56-year-old
plasterer bearing an elaborate dog tattoo. "This is the only day of
the year we can really let go and feel free."</TE>

<HD>Enron Insider to Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH>Energy: Michael Kopper, who played a key role in the
company's complex financing, will help prosecutors target his
ex-bosses, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. executive Michael J. Kopper has agreed to plead
guilty to criminal charges, sources said Tuesday, becoming the first
company insider to admit to wrongdoing and laying the groundwork for
the prosecution of higher-ranking executives.</LD>
<LD>   Kopper, 37, will plead guilty today in federal court in Houston to
one felony charge of money laundering and one charge of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud, sources said. He also will pay $12 million, one
official said. That is the amount Kopper earned investing in and
overseeing off-the-books partnerships used to conceal Enron's debts.</LD>
<LD>   Kopper's plea arrangement is a major boost for the government in
its investigation of the energy company, whose collapse last year
triggered national scrutiny of corporate practices and a wave of
reforms aimed at curbing abuses.</LD>
<TE>   Once the seventh-largest U.S. company, Enron declared bankruptcy
Dec. 2 after it was forced to disclose losses from off-the-books
partnerships that had been used to hide its precarious financial
condition. The firm's demise wiped out tens of billions of dollars in
investment value.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, drafted by former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow to manage one of the partnerships, is expected to help
prosecutors navigate the company's maze of dealings and testify
against his superiors. He could not be reached for comment and his
lawyer did not return a call.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you flip an insider, it's very important," said Stephen
M. Ryan, a former prosecutor who is now in private practice in
Washington. "He can tie together all the meetings and documents with
his testimony and tell you what really occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Kopper is an especially big catch because he is thought capable of
implicating Fastow, who masterminded the energy giant's schemes to
disguise liabilities and inflate earnings through the use of
supposedly independent partnerships, according to an Enron internal
investigation. The report found that Fastow reaped at least $30
million for himself by investing in and operating the partnerships,
which engaged in asset purchases and sales with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "The person put at the greatest risk in a Kopper plea is Andy
Fastow," said Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor now at Smith
Gambrell &amp; Russell in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper also may be able to provide evidence linking Kenneth L.
Lay, Enron's former chairman, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the onetime
chief executive. His assistance also is likely to turn up the
pressure on others to cooperate with the government, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's high up," one source said of Kopper. "He's going to know
what was going on there. Guys don't agree to a plea unless they've
done something wrong and they have something to give up in the way of
information."</TE>
<TE>   Kopper's plea bargain also is likely to blunt criticism that
investigators have been too slow in moving against Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known what sentence prosecutors would recommend if they
are satisfied with Kopper's cooperation. The counts to which Kopper
will plead guilty could expose him to a maximum of 15 years in
prison, but prosecutors expect to recommend a more lenient sentence
if he assists fully in their probe.</TE>
<TE>   However, several attorneys in private practice said it was likely
that Kopper would serve some jail time.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a rising star at Enron, Kopper eventually became
managing director of Enron Global Equity Markets Group. But he took
on a new job in 1997, unknown to Enron's directors, to invest in and
manage Chewco Investments, an early version of the questionable
partnerships favored by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow had planned to run Chewco but decided against it when he
was told he would have to disclose his participation to shareholders.
Instead, he tapped Kopper, whose role could be concealed because he
was a lower-level employee.</TE>
<TE>   Chewco was created to allow Enron to buy out an investment by the
California Public Employees' Retirement System in another Enron
partnership, known as JEDI, thereby keeping debts exceeding $700
million off Enron's books.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper was paid $2 million in management and other fees for
running Chewco, the Enron internal report found, but investigators
said they could not determine "what, if anything, Kopper did to
justify the payments."</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, along with his domestic partner, William Dodson, reaped
more than $10 million from an initial investment of $125,000 in the
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Chewco's secret role as an investment vehicle was disclosed last
year, when Enron concluded in November that it had insufficient
outside ownership to qualify as an independent partnership. As a
result, the energy trader had to restate income lower by more than
$400 million between 1997 and 2000--helping trigger its collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper left Enron in July 2001, with severance of $905,000, to run
LJM2 Capital Management, another Enron-related partnership that he
helped manage. Kopper violated Enron's code of conduct by secretly
investing in Chewco and other partnerships and by offering stakes to
other employees, the Enron internal report said.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper was removed from the LJM2 job January by the other
investors, who accused Kopper of transferring $4 million from LJM2 to
pay his annual management fee of $70,000. Kopper sued over the
ouster, but the suit was dismissed Aug. 5 after Kopper refused to
testify in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper figures prominently in the only other criminal charges
brought in the Enron case: charges of wire fraud brought against
three former investment bankers at Greenwich NatWest, a British bank.</TE>
<TE>   Gary S. Mulgrew, Giles R.H. Darby and David J. Bermingham were
accused June 27 of secretly investing in an Enron partnership known
as Southampton, earning them more than $7 million in profit. The men
allegedly recommended that the bank sell its stake in another Enron
partnership to Southampton for $1 million even though the men knew it
was worth more.</TE>
<TE>   The men then paid Kopper and Fastow $250,000 for ownership rights
to the stake, which they subsequently sold for $7.3 million, the
government said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of its filing last year, Enron's was the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. The sheer size of investor and employee
losses stunned the public and triggered an avalanche of hearings on
Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper's guilty plea would mark the first clear win for federal
prosecutors since a Texas jury found accounting firm Arthur Andersen
guilty of one felony count of obstruction of justice in June.</TE>
<TE>   During the six-week trial of Andersen, Enron's auditor, government
lawyers argued that Andersen executives ordered employees to shred
documents to impede an investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They were aided by star witness David B. Duncan,
Andersen's lead Enron auditor, who had pleaded guilty to a separate
obstruction charge.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, significant detail emerged of how Enron
aggressively pushed Andersen to sign off on dubious transactions,
even if it meant ignoring potentially huge accounting errors and
violating Andersen's own procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors now are increasingly turning their attention toward a
cadre of investment banks that bankrolled Enron. They are
investigating whether the Wall Street firms devised financing
mechanisms that intentionally understated assets and inflated
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was the first big company to divulge massive accounting
problems, and it set the stage for the host of companies that would
make similar disclosures. Yet the government has already lodged
charges against some of those other companies, such as WorldCom Inc.,
leading to criticism that the task force was moving too slowly
against Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But Ken Johnson, a spokesman for one of the congressional
committees investigating Enron, said the comparison was unfair
because of the complexity of the Enron case. "They start at the
bottom of the totem pole and work their way up," he said. "While
Kopper was a player at Enron, it's clear he took his marching orders
from people like Andy Fastow. This is just the first shoe to drop."</TE>

<HD>Scars Go More Than Skin Deep</HD>
<DH>At 7, Nathan, badly hurt in an earthquake, faces additional
surgery, unkind stares and possible post-traumatic stress syndrome.</DH>

<DL>NAPA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Nathan Schank wears the scars of the fault line.</LD>
<LD>   Each time he looks into a mirror, the 7-year-old with the
cowlicked brown hair sees the aftermath of the 5.2-magnitude
earthquake that struck Northern California's wine country two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The temblor left $55 million in damage, rattled vintners and other
residents and caused no worse than minor injuries--except to Nathan.
Striking at 1:36 a.m., the quake collapsed the fireplace in the
living room where Nathan was having a slumber party with his older
brother, Adam, and a teenage cousin. He was crushed under an
avalanche of bricks and mortar that wreaked havoc on his insides and
shattered his right arm and pelvic bone. Doctors gave him only a 20%
chance of surviving.</LD>
<TE>   Nathan lived. After 28 operations, a 14-inch stitch line snakes
down his chest past his navel. He carries a patchwork of other scars
on his legs, right arm and hip, where surgeons took skin grafts.
Doctors plan to operate on him again today to close tissue in his
abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   The rambunctious second-grader resists discussing the accident
with his parents. But he will occasionally approach strangers to
announce, "I'm the little boy hurt in the earthquake," lifting his
shirt to show the jagged stitch work. His parents and doctors see
something more: a child forced to face death, one who is still
struggling with the enormity of what happened to him.</TE>
<TE>   He's become part of a series of studies on the effects of
post-traumatic stress syndrome on infants and children. Although
experts once thought the malady afflicted only adults such as rape
victims and war veterans, the studies show that children can suffer
it too.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say children often carry painful reminders of such
events as earthquakes, fires, car wrecks and violent crime, but
exhibit symptoms differently from adults.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents tend to underestimate the amount of trauma kids
experience," said Dr. Herb Schreier, a psychiatrist at Children's
Hospital in Oakland who examined Nathan. "But we're finding that
small children, particularly those under the age of 5, exhibit their
emotional scars in different ways. And we need to set new
definitions."</TE>
<TE>   Studies involving some 100 patients have examined reactions in
children, some of whom have yet to speak. One case involved a
2-year-old who watched her father murder her mother. Another featured
a teen who witnessed the murder of both parents several years apart.</TE>
<TE>   Schreier said many traumatized children eventually suffer panic
attacks. Others regress emotionally when faced with reminders of
painful events.</TE>
<TE>   For Nathan, the stress of the earthquake lingered in outbursts of
anger. Almost immediately, he began having temper tantrums at the
hospital, throwing things at the wall and at his mother when he
didn't get his way.</TE>
<TE>   At home, he'll pout: "I wish that earthquake killed me. I wish God
didn't save me." Other times, he'll ask, almost out of nowhere: "Why
me, Mom? Why did I have to get hurt?"</TE>
<TE>   Schreier fears Nathan has a long road ahead. "With his scars, he
has physical reminders," he said. "Over the years, it will be harder
for him to distance himself from this."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say today's operation on Nathan is routine. But his mother
still worries. Since Nathan left the hospital in January 2001, she
has become more protective, watching for the unkind stares of
strangers.</TE>
<TE>   At the family's new home in American Canyon, not far from Napa,
Nathan seldom wears a shirt in the summer heat and is not
self-conscious about his body. But one day a friend of Adam's told
him, "Don't show me your scars. They're ugly." That's when Kimberly
Schank explained to Nathan that not everybody understands what he has
endured.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'I love your scars. You know why? Because they saved
your life,' " she said. " 'To me, they're beautiful. They're a part
of who you are.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now, every night when Nathan goes to bed, his 34-year-old mother
makes a point of kissing the scars "to show him that it's OK, that
I'm not grossed out."</TE>
<TE>   But Kimberly Schank knows she won't always be there to explain
away people's rudeness. And when Nathan hits puberty, a time when
teenagers worry about their bodies, what then?</TE>
<TE>   For now, she can only reassure this energetic boy who likes to
whisper into his mother's ear and create goofy faces to make her
laugh, the boy who keeps a poster on his bedroom wall showing a
kitten imagining itself as a tiger, with the caption "Dream Big."</TE>
<TE>   Anything to ease Nathan's murky memories of waking moments after
the earthquake struck early on a Sunday to find himself buried in
bricks. His mother remembers the horror of finding both her boys
curled up in front of the fireplace that she and her husband knew was
cracked but had not asked the landlord to fix. Frantically, they
scrambled through the bricks to reach their sons.</TE>
<TE>   Adam was only slightly injured, but they knew immediately that
Nathan was a different story. Yet it was only after rushing him to
Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa that they realized the gravity
of his condition--when a nurse told them: "Your son is in very
serious trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The boy was taken by helicopter to Oakland's Children's Hospital,
where doctors operated to stop the bleeding in a leg artery and to
relieve pressure from blood filling his abdomen. He was given 14
units of blood, enough to fill his body twice over.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, his intestines were so swollen that doctors could not
close the wound. Instead, they covered the area with plastic wrap,
leaving them partly exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Months after he was hospitalized, Nathan took a big step toward
being a boy again: He asked for his bicycle--a blue Diamondback with
training wheels. His parents brought it to his hospital room. Soon he
started talking about climbing trees and becoming a movie star.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan's mother plans a Labor Day weekend barbecue to mark the
second anniversary of his accident and his anticipated homecoming
after this week's surgeries. "We're all still dealing with this," she
said. "For me, it's the remembering, the hurt of seeing my son
incapacitated."</TE>
<TE>   The day is part of the family's effort to rebuild itself.</TE>
<TE>   After Nathan was injured, Delmar Schank took months off without
pay from his job at a family-owned fire extinguisher business to be
with his son. Now money problems have forced Kimberly to work part
time at a gas station to help pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   They still worry about 9-year-old Adam, a shy boy with piercing
brown eyes who has drawn deeper into his shell.</TE>
<TE>   He recently confessed to his mother that when she and Adam's
father were at the hospital with Nathan for five months, he thought
they didn't love him anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about breaking down," Kimberly said of her reaction to Adam,
who now sees a therapist. "That little comment just made me realize
how much that earthquake has left its mark on those boys. And our
entire family."</TE>
<TE>   Each morning before work, Delmar, 35, goes to his sons' room to
kiss them goodbye. "You just don't realize how in a split second you
can lose everything that's dear to you," he said. "Now, not a day
goes by that I don't hug my boys, even if they don't know I'm there."</TE>
<TE>   At the family's new home, no glass frames hang over the beds.
Furniture is bolted to the wall. The Schanks aren't taking any more
chances.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Nathan talks of his scars as though they were just the
remains of some bad bicycle spill. "I need to show you something;
it's the scar," he says to a visitor, lifting his T-shirt.
"Sometimes, they get cold."</TE>
<TE>   Both boys repeated school grades--Nathan because of his injuries;
Adam after falling behind from the stress of seeing his brother
suffer. On the refrigerator hangs a reminder of some important dates:
Tuesday, which was Nathan's first day of second grade, and this
morning, when he heads for the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Schank has taken her boys back to visit their old house
in an effort at closure. On a recent trip, Nathan climbed onto a fire
hydrant and threw dirt clods into the street.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than scold him, his mother beamed: "For now, that's his
best therapy. Just being a boy."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified Hails Reforms as Test Scores Rise for Fourth
Year</HD>
<DH>Education: Elementary grades show gains in reading and
math, but higher grades lag.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND, SOLOMON MOORE and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles elementary schools have raised their standardized test
scores for the fourth straight year--the strongest evidence yet that
the district's reading and math reforms are working, district
officials and independent experts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The gains by the Los Angeles Unified School District on the
Stanford 9 basic skills exam follow the introduction of uniform
teaching methods and materials, as well as a commitment to state
standards that specify what students should know grade by grade.</LD>
<LD>   Education experts said the improvements are remarkable given the
challenges faced by the nation's second-largest school district,
where half the new teachers lack full credentials, dozens of
overcrowded schools operate on abbreviated calendars and many
students are poor and did not learn to speak English at home.</LD>
<TE>   "It shows that high-stakes testing and the idea of constantly
pushing schools to demonstrate success does, in fact, increase
achievement," said Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for
Education Reform in Washington, an education advocacy group. "All the
excuses [about] poverty really can be overcome in part by holding
schools accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the district also modestly narrowed the achievement gap
that separates whites and Asians from lower-performing African
Americans and Latinos, a Times analysis of the test scores showed.</TE>
<TE>   But the scores also show that the district's students, on balance,
still lag far behind the rest of the nation, particularly in the
upper grades. Less than one-third of fifth-graders rank at or above
the national average--the 50th percentile--in reading. The overall
scores of students in middle schools have climbed far less than those
at elementary campuses. High school performance remains virtually
flat.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. Roy Romer said he expects the scores of secondary
students to improve as higher-performing elementary students move
into the upper grades, where the district is aiming its next set of
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is spectacular evidence of growth," Romer said as he
released the elementary scores Tuesday, accompanied by Gov. Gray
Davis at Rosemont Elementary in Echo Park. "This district deserves to
be known for what it's done."</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young said other districts might
take heart from the district's steady gains.</TE>
<TE>   "The kinds of innovations we have done here are replicable in
other school districts," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The district released its test scores a week ahead of the
statewide results. All of California's scores had to be delayed
because the district missed a July 1 deadline for submitting its test
score sheets; the district is so large that leaving its scores out of
statewide totals would have skewed the results.</TE>
<TE>   The snafu did not, however, hold up the release of scores in Los
Angeles, where about 550,000 students in grades 2 to 11 took the
test. Students' individual scores are being sent to parents.</TE>
<TE>   The school district did not release results that will show whether
students have mastered the state's academic standards in English and
language arts. Those results will be out next week.</TE>
<TE>   The scores released Tuesday showed that:</TE>
<TE>   * The percentage of students scoring at or above the national
average--the 50th percentile--increased in every elementary grade
level tested last spring compared to 2001 in reading, spelling,
language mechanics and math. It was the fourth consecutive year of
gains in grades 2 through 5.</TE>
<TE>   * Elementary students posted the highest scores and showed the
most growth in math. For the first time, a majority of second-and
third-graders performed at or above the national average in math.</TE>
<TE>   * Fourth-graders posted greater gains than third-graders in
reading and math, suggesting that students are grasping the material
even as it becomes more complex.</TE>
<TE>   * Less than a third of middle school students attained the
national average in reading this year. Only about a fifth of
ninth-and 10th-graders met the average, marking no improvement in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   * Overall, Latinos and African Americans scored lower than whites
and Asians but showed the greatest gains among ethnic groups last
year. That improvement was most marked in math, and in the elementary
grades.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the achievement gap remained wide: African Americans and
Latinos scored in the 34th percentile overall, compared with the 67th
percentile for whites and the 70th for Asians.</TE>
<TE>   Educators outside Los Angeles were surprised at the district's
progress in the elementary grades. Research in other districts has
shown that test results typically plateau after the third year of an
exam such as the Stanford 9.</TE>
<TE>   "This jump in scores in L.A. suggests that something [good] is
going on beyond test preparation," said Bruce Fuller, a professor of
education and public policy at UC Berkeley. "The gains in the ...
elementary grades are quite remarkable. I think L.A. has proved the
skeptics wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and administrators in elementary schools across the
sprawling district chalked up their success to a combination of
factors. Among those cited: the Open Court reading program, increased
teacher training, implementation of California's academic standards
and--for added incentive--a statewide accountability system that
ranks schools by their test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Open Court is a heavily scripted, step-by-step program introduced
three years ago in about 30 elementary schools for students in
kindergarten through second grade. A year later, most of the
districts' 426 elementary schools adopted it in those primary grades.
It was expanded to grades 3 through 5 last year.</TE>
<TE>   The reading program gives teachers a daily curricular road map,
starting with sound-letter exercises for 5-and 6-year olds. As
children grow more advanced, they encounter lessons on grammar,
spelling and writing, and begin to read literature.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Lorena Street Elementary in Boyle Heights initially
resisted the program's strict regimen but have since embraced it,
said Peggy Pena, the school's literacy coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The school's fourth-grade reading scores have improved
dramatically: Five years ago, the average fourth-grader ranked at the
10th percentile nationally in reading. Last year, the average
fourth-grader was at the 24th percentile. Though still low, it's a
big improvement, teachers say.</TE>
<TE>   "People went in kicking and screaming," Pena said of teachers.
"Once they saw the progress with the kids, they dropped that
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Pena said the program gave the school's new teachers necessary
guidance from the beginning. "Open Court really teaches people how to
teach," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The school district also has enhanced teacher preparation.
Teachers using the Open Court program undergo several days of
training. In addition, the district has hired 965 veteran teachers to
serve as coaches to assist fellow instructors in reading and math
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Rosemont Elementary, the Echo Park school that Romer
and Davis visited Tuesday, said the reforms have clarified what is
expected of them. The changes also have led to more collaboration at
the year-round school, where students and staff operate on three
separate schedules, or tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Second-grade teacher Arleen Irvin, who as been at Rosemont 16
years, said the reforms have created a new sense of purpose on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go into any second-grade class and know where the class
is [academically]," Irvin said. "Consistency is high."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Rosemarie Kubena of Reseda Elementary said the state's
new accountability system has also prompted her and her staff to work
harder. Schools and their faculties can earn cash rewards for rising
test scores. Those that falter can have their teachers and
administrators moved and possibly see their doors closed.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that having the [accountability system] and monetary
rewards for the school is definitely helping motivate teachers more,"
said Kubena, whose school was awarded $12,000 last year for its
testing gains. "When scores come out high it makes you feel
wonderful. Let's face it, [teachers] want to have some sort of
acknowledgment."</TE>
<TE>   With elementary schools' scores rising, district officials said
they are turning their attention to secondary campuses.</TE>

<HD>Price of Confidence Is More Than Jailing a Few CEOs</HD>
<DH>Trust grows only in a soil of fairness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm a mortgage holder, nervous about the economy, employed in an
industry that is sensitive to ups and downs, dismayed about the
losses in my 401(k) mutual-fund retirement savings, dubious about the
future of Social Security and furious--staggered--by perversions of
our free-market system. And, oh yes, a voter who refuses to give up
on the system. I think I fit the profile. I'm one of those whom Wall
Street, the Bush administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve
want to soothe.</LD>
<LD>   They want my confidence back. They want me to believe that
business integrity has been restored. I only wish....</LD>
<LD>   True, we can't discount the things we see, such as highfliers
dragged down to earth by the cold weight of handcuffs and the
encouraging new tone of indignation in our politics. Let's also
acknowledge the changes we hear about and cannot see: this fresh mood
of caution in the nerve centers of our economy, from the boardrooms
to the watchdogs.</LD>
<TE>   But when showboating stock promoter Jack Grubman walked off with
millions of dollars last week, the conclusion was unavoidable. We
haven't really gotten to the heart of the matter: There is far more
than ledger-book fraud and allegations of fraud behind Enron, Global
Crossing, WorldCom, Andersen, the IPO insider gimmicks, Qwest,
Adelphia, Wall Street analysis flimflams and the rest. If we have
learned anything during these grim few months it's that our market
system has been driven askew on a grand scale.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fundamental American ideals, like fairness and rightness,
still are not being seriously discussed in the context of this most
fundamental American undertaking. For me, and judging by my mail, for
a good many people, faith in the system does not hinge on whether a
few outlaws eventually draw prison time for fraud. Or whether CEOs
attest to the honesty of their accounting. Or whether Bill Clinton is
as much to blame as George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Confidence needs deeper soil to take root. Jack Grubman was the
top-dog telecommunications barker at Salomon Smith Barney. He talked
his way right into corporate boardrooms and then traded on his
reputation, to quote him, as the man investors could trust to know
"what's going on.'' He happily took credit as leader of the 1990s
telecom investment frenzy. He stuck with it almost to the end, and
then weaseled out by saying, oops, he wasn't really in the know after
all.</TE>
<TE>   Because he was high on companies like WorldCom during the stock
run-up, the telecom industry was high on him. Salomon made almost $1
billion providing merger advice and underwriting telecommunications
securities. Grubman made $20 million a year himself. "What used to be
a conflict is now a synergy,'' Grubman told Business Week a couple of
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   While Grubman was in full thunder about the opportunities in
telecom investments, executives inside the industry were already
seeing trouble and had begun what would be a $14.2-billion stock
cash-out, according to the Wall Street Journal. Then "pop.'' While
Grubman and Salomon and the other insiders counted their riches,
rank-and-file investors lost a reported $2 trillion in
telecommunications. This included retirement dreams of countless
thousands of working Americans. More than 35,000 people have been
thrown out of their jobs as one after another of these companies
declared bankruptcy. These are big numbers. Lots of disappointment,
plenty of broken dreams, many sheep led to slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   So what happens to Grubman? With investigators circling, he leaves
Salomon by "mutual agreement,'' whatever that means, and rakes in a
reported $13-million severance package. According to some reports, he
kept a $15-million bonus that was supposed to be forfeited if he
departed under a regulatory cloud. A $19-million loan was reportedly
forgiven. Salomon agreed to pay his legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   How's that for a golden shove out the door? How's that for a kick
in the teeth for everyone burned by Grubman's favored client,
WorldCom? "I understand the disappointment and anger felt by
investors,'' Grubman was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt that, Jack.</TE>
<TE>   What the current economic downturn vividly demonstrates is the
corruption not just of business but of the old-fashioned ideals of
business. In the fairy tale, rewards for success were supposed to be
balanced by the jeopardy of failure. And that's just the least of it.
But even this is no longer true. You can flop and still take home
millions, you can leave untold wreckage behind you and still live in
silk-stocking luxury--provided you have clawed or lucked your way
into the interlocking clubhouse of corporate elites who set each
other's salaries and bonuses and who are loyal to each other in the
way that street gangs stand by their members.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman protested that he was suffering "great pain'' as a result
of being singled out for criticism. But of course. There are scores,
maybe hundreds, just like him riding the high side of their sailboats
in the Caribbean or holding down the prime tee times on the best
courses in Maui, living large on the dreams they wrecked.</TE>
<TE>   Trust in our system? Right now, I'm sticking with novelist E.M.
Forster, who said that "trust is a luxury that only the wealthy can
indulge.''</TE>

<HD>Women Must Be Freed From Koranic Brutalities</HD>
<DH>Stoning and other ancient penalties can't be tolerated in
the 21 century.</DH>
<SE></SE>

Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,

<LD>Imagine being stoned to death for having sex outside of marriage.
Such may be the fate of 30-year-old Amina Lawal in northern Nigeria,
whose appeal to an Islamic court was rejected Monday. Her lawyers
said they planned to appeal to a higher court. As Lawal, sinking into
despair, clutched her baby to her chest, the magnanimous Islamic
court ruled that the execution will occur after the baby's
breastfeeding days come to an end.</LD>
<LD>   The faithful praised the upholding of the sentence as a victory
for Islam and for Islamic law, or Sharia. Once again, the harsh
interpretation of ancient rules came down hardest on women. (The man
Lawal named as the father of her girl was acquitted for lack of
evidence.)</LD>
<LD>   In too many Muslim countries, women remain second-class citizens,
with many of their basic rights denied in the name of religion and
tradition. The right to vote, drive, work, walk in the street without
a man or receive a meaningful education are denied or curtailed to
different degrees.</LD>
<TE>   This is not true of every predominantly Muslim nation. The
democratically elected president of Indonesia, for example, is a
woman, as is the prime minister of Bangladesh. Neither is the
situation universal in Arab countries. In virtually every Arab
country, men have a tight grip on power, but women don't always live
in total subjugation. Where there is more education--education beyond
the study of the Koran--women tend to have more rights.</TE>
<TE>   But practices such as so-called "honor killings," in which women
who bring shame to their families face horrifying fates at the hands
of male relatives, are still practiced. Any attempt to point out the
plight of Muslim women brings a predictable outcry, often from Muslim
women, that we in the West fail to understand their culture and
religion and that we should not try to impose our ethnocentric values
on them. But ask Lawal if she wants the world to respect the ancient,
excruciating practice of death by stoning.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that many followers of the Islamic faith maintain that
these practices are outside the teachings of their religion. The
Muslim Women's League says the holy book explicitly states that women
are equal to men and "the prevailing view that devalues and belittles
women is derived from sociocultural factors that are derived by a
distorted and erroneous interpretation" of their religion. The issue
is not one of freedom to practice religion. It is a matter of human
dignity and human rights. The holy texts of Christianity and Judaism
include a few choice passages that would send chills down our spines
were they to become law in today's world. The truth is that even the
most devout followers of those religions are selective about what
they enforce. Our creed today is that women are full human beings,
entitled to freedoms equal to those of men. The definition of that
equality may vary from home to home, but the basic concept has been
enshrined in laws and in international agreements.</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of Kabul, the vast majority of women still shroud
themselves in the traditional burkas. In the Afghan capital,
deviating from the strictest interpretation of Islam may no longer be
grounds for death, but as the day-to-day realities of post-Taliban
life become apparent, it is clear that liberation from the tyranny of
the Taliban is a relative matter. In the heady days following the
overthrow of the Taliban, as the U.S. rejoiced in its victory,
politicians pointed to the freeing of Afghan women as one of the
great victories of the war on terror. Alas, the condition of women
was really an afterthought. Women in parts of the Muslim world live
with customs that governed the world many centuries ago. As the world
tries to persuade the followers of Islam to listen more closely to
the teachings of more moderate Muslims, the fate of women hangs in
the balance.</TE>
<TE>   For women like Amina Lawal, efforts to support a more moderate
interpretation of Islam may come tragically too late.</TE>

<AU>RICHARD H. GREENE</AU>
<BD>Richard H. Greene is an attorney and mediator in Malibu
who teaches conflict resolution courses.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spectacle of greedy, overpaid ballplayers duking it out with
kvetching billionaire owners while little kids and the country are
deprived of the national pastime is distasteful enough.</LD>
<LD>   But the external costs of the inability of these two immature
parties to behave properly are more than distasteful. They demand
that we create a new economic model on how we treat this and every
other strike.</LD>
<LD>   We do that by paying attention to the real, hard-dollar costs that
selfish, striking employees or selfish, locking-out employers or
immature, greedy bargaining parties cause other, innocent, parties.</LD>
<TE>   In the baseball strike set for Aug. 30, the Labor Department and
all of us should ask:</TE>
<TE>   * How much will peanut vendors and parking lot attendants and hot
dog and souvenir sellers on near-minimum wage lose? Let's charge the
striking parties for this.</TE>
<TE>   * How much will the city-run and private parking lots or
restaurants that rely on game traffic lose from fans not coming to
games? Let's charge the striking parties for this.</TE>
<TE>   * How much will television networks, sporting goods companies and
advertisers that have sponsored ballplayers or stadiums lose when
"The Selfish Boys and Men of Summer" engage in their almost annual
bickering? Let's charge the striking parties for this as well.</TE>
<TE>   So, let them fight. At this point, I couldn't care less. But let's
make them pay for the privilege.</TE>
<TE>   There is a cost to them striking, and peanut vendors are not the
ones who should bear it.</TE>
<TE>   If we truly factored in the external costs of this and every other
strike, and made the parties pay for their actions, the simple
economics would make the parties find a solution fast.</TE>
<TE>   Why don't we place the cost for strikes where it belongs? I call
it "true cost factoring."</TE>
<TE>   No one wins in a strike. It is nothing more than a modern-day form
of Stone Age bludgeoning. The goal, like boxing, is to inflict enough
damage to make the other party fall to the floor in a bloody puddle
or just give up.</TE>
<TE>   It's absurd.</TE>
<TE>   There is a civilized alternative. An alternative, in fact, that
the players and owners themselves use every year to settle individual
salary disputes. It's called binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone gets to make his or her case, all of the facts and
emotional arguments are heard and considered by trained, professional
neutral parties, and a solution is reached.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of arbitration is that whenever parties can't agree
after a certain period, they simply submit their arguments to this
neutral panel. No lockout, no fuss, no mess, no strike and, most
important, no injuries to innocent parties (who really need the
money).</TE>
<TE>   So let's insist that the players and owners arbitrate their
differences or, if they are unwilling to do that, make them factor in
the potentially enormous costs they cause the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Saudi Rift Rewards Terrorists</HD>
<DH>The two allies need a united front: Friendship works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HASSAN YASSIN</AU>
<BD>Hassan Yassin is a Saudi Arabia businessman and oil
consultant.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like so many of my fellow Saudi Arabians, I am and always have been a
friend of the United States. Never have I doubted that the U.S. is a
friend of ours.</LD>
<LD>   However, recent events and the spiraling level of criticism
directed at Saudi Arabia have called into question the durability of
our friendship and brought about a situation that few of us would
ever have believed possible: The United States of America and the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are drifting apart.</LD>
<LD>   That this should be causing us the most profound concern and the
greatest sorrow should come as no surprise to anyone who truly
understands our relationship, because this strain is wholly
unnecessary.</LD>
<TE>   Reasonable people, in my country and the U.S., assessing our
long-standing and deep-rooted ties can but ask themselves how it is
possible that relations have deteriorated so swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago I was invited to dinner at the U.S. Consulate in
Jiddah, and a visiting staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee asked the simple question: Why does Saudi Arabia wish to
maintain good relations with the United States?</TE>
<TE>   I began my answer by recalling just how good those relations have
been for the last 80 years.</TE>
<TE>   None of us have ever forgotten that during World War I, when the
countries of the Middle East were still subjected to British and
French imperialism, the U.S. supported our struggle for
self-determination and independence and continued to do so until
those dreams of independence were realized. Later, when the British,
French and Israelis invaded Egypt during the Suez Crisis of 1956, the
U.S. did not hesitate to turn against its allies and destroy their
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   And yet this has not been a one-sided relationship. Arabs and
Muslims across the Middle East allied themselves with the U.S. in its
fight against the spread of communism, particularly during the Soviet
Union's invasion of Afghanistan; and we stood side by side with
Washington when Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, our only serious disagreement with the U.S. has been over
its policy toward the vexing issue of Palestine and Israel. Yet we
have never suggested that if you are not with us then you are against
us. Instead, despite often being poles apart on this issue, we have
not hesitated to try to come up with solutions to resolve the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Almost by definition, friendship has to be able to accommodate
differences of opinion, and differences of opinion should not be
enough in itself to terminate friendship. For example, the U.S. has a
strong relationship with the European Union, all of whose constituent
countries, apart from Britain, are firmly set against Washington's
intention to go to war with Iraq. Yet no one would seriously argue
that the U.S. will end its relationship with the European Union
because of this.</TE>
<TE>   Matters are perhaps coming to a head because we are approaching
the first anniversary of the heinous acts that took place on Sept.
11, perpetrated by 19 terrorists, 15 of whom were Saudi Arabians and
all of whom were guided in their actions by another former Saudi
Arabian, Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Saudi Arabia has apologized repeatedly and
expressed its profound sorrow both for what happened and for the fact
that so many Saudis were involved.</TE>
<TE>   But endless analysis of such criminal madness can only lead us to
conclude that Bin Laden involved other Saudi Arabians in order to
engineer exactly the consequences that we are now witnessing: a
growing rift between our two countries that could soon, and entirely
unnecessarily, develop into enmity. Bin Laden himself stated that his
avowed intent was to orchestrate not just attacks on the U.S. but
also the overthrow of the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   We are all agreed that he must not succeed. So Saudi Arabia will
continue to support the U.S. in its war against terrorism, and it
fervently wishes to be a partner in this struggle.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. must surely realize that we will achieve this much more
swiftly if we are united rather than divided. Instead of expending
our energies on creating divisions between our countries, we should
be doing all that we can to cement our mutual ties.</TE>
<TE>   If our two nations can work together to root out the causes and
the perpetrators of terrorism, and to avert any further horrendous
acts of violence, then we will have done far more to honor the memory
of those who died so needlessly on 9/11 than any war of words or
deterioration in relations will ever achieve.</TE>
<TE>   So why does Saudi Arabia want good relations with the United
States? The answer is as simple as the question--because friendship
works.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Egypt's interior minister said recently that the government was
taking exceptional care in the case of jailed activist Saad Eddin
Ibrahim because he had U.S. and Egyptian citizenship and was Egypt's
most prominent democracy proponent. That statement turned out to be
so much hot air July 29 when a judge peremptorily proclaimed
Ibrahim's guilt on trumped-up charges. The judge turned what was
supposed to be a routine hearing into judgment day.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration quickly and rightly criticized the verdict
and seven-year prison sentence. Last week Washington sent an even
clearer message when it rejected Cairo's request for more money on
top of the $2 billion the U.S. sends annually. It is clear that
Ibrahim was convicted not for the ostensible reason, receiving
foreign funds without authorization, but for criticizing the
autocratic government of President Hosni Mubarak.</LD>
<LD>   Ibrahim, 63 and in poor health, was a sociology professor at
American University in Cairo and director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center
for Social Development Studies. He monitored Egyptian elections and
pointed out the vote-rigging that canceled out democracy. The
government decides what political parties can function and wins
elections so overwhelmingly that many Egyptians don't bother to vote.
Ibrahim also documented discrimination against Egypt's Coptic
Christians and the country's poor human rights record.</LD>
<TE>   Ibrahim's activities were too much for Mubarak's regime. Two years
ago Ibrahim was charged with receiving illegal funds from the
European Commission to monitor elections and with defaming the
country in his human rights reports. The judge conducted a six-month
trial with thousands of pages of evidence but took little more than
an hour to issue a verdict. An appeals court overturned the
conviction without saying why, at which point the government should
have dropped the charges. Instead it continued the
Alice-in-Wonderland process with a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists in Egypt are more wary now about speaking
out or accepting foreign funds. That's bad for a nation that prides
itself on being the intellectual center of the Arab world and that
could be a leader in developing democracy. Rather than promoting a
civil society, Mubarak's government continues its repression and
intolerance of all dissent.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should keep urging Egypt, a nation that
depends on U.S. aid, to move toward political freedom. Aside from
Israel, the Middle East is a wasteland when it comes to
representative government. Ibrahim was only trying to change that.</TE>

<DH>LAUSD scores are better but have far to go.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in South-Central Los
Angeles, second-graders zip through chapter books and ace math
problems with up to four-digit numbers. Their improved Stanford 9
test scores, released Tuesday, provide an excellent lesson for the
Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   These inner-city children, all qualifying for free lunches, scored
in the top one-third nationally in reading and the top one-fifth in
math on the test. The second-graders posted an increase of 10 points
in reading and math over last year. If the kids at King can do it,
boys and girls at every school can do it.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, King's scores are an exception. In the LAUSD
overall, second-graders scored in the bottom half for reading. The
district's scores are steadily improving, but under-50% reading
scores still are nothing to get too excited about.</LD>
<TE>   Reading and math scores rose overall in the district for the
fourth consecutive year, helped by schools like Rosemont Avenue
Elementary in Echo Park, where second-grade reading scores more than
doubled in the last four years. Gov. Gray Davis stopped by to
congratulate the students and called the LAUSD's fine showing a
"four-peat," a riff on the Lakers' three consecutive championships.</TE>
<TE>   This school district will need a "ten-peat" to move the needle
high enough in the secondary grades, where test scores showed
students making minuscule progress or stagnating in the academic
cellar.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, primary grades performed best on the test, powering
growth spurts that reflected better teaching, the return to a
stronger reading program and classes limited to 20 students. In the
fourth grade, the work gets harder and class size grows to 32. Not
surprisingly, failure starts here. But test scores show
fourth-graders are moving close to the national average in math and
are making progress in reading.</TE>
<TE>   The Council of the Great City Schools, which includes the LAUSD,
reported in June that over the last two years most urban districts
had raised scores. Few had as far to go as the LAUSD. Five years ago,
the worst schools scored in the single digits. Those single-digit
scores all but disappeared this time.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. schools Supt. Roy Romer remains concerned about middle school
and high school, and he should be. Stubbornly low scores reveal that
many high school students can barely decipher a driver's license
manual, ballot or menu. The gap between the worst schools and the
best ones in the LAUSD is narrowing, bit by bit. The public school
system is nowhere near where it needs to be. But it's inching in the
right direction, and for that, as impatient as we might be, we offer
a cheer.</TE>

California just want their money. They don't care about insider
details of the political foolishness that is preventing passage of a
state budget nearly two months after it was due. Just send their
checks.</LD>
<LD>   There has been little outside pressure to get the budget passed
because most programs continue to be financed automatically. But now,
the stalemate is preventing the state Franchise Tax Board from
distributing $116 million in an annual payment to the aged, blind or
disabled who participate in a program of assistance for homeowners
and renters. (Their monthly benefits are not affected.) The annual
payment averages just $302 but it's important to people who struggle
to get by.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is that Republicans in the Assembly refuse to vote for
the budget because it contains a tax increase, because the governor
will not open new budget negotiations and because he will not cut
additional billions.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed the Senate but froze in the lower house when no
GOP member would support it. Majority Democrats need at least four
Republicans to get the 54 votes needed to pass the spending bill.</TE>
<TE>   This budget is no work of art. That's the reality of trying to
plug a $23.6-billion deficit. But it is irresponsible for Republicans
to block it any longer. Gov. Gray Davis and the Democrats have moved
small steps toward the Republican position. So there is little that
Davis or the Democrats can do now other than tear up the budget bill
and start over. That probably would not gain anything. Davis has told
departments to prepare spending cuts of 20% for next year. The Senate
is creating a commission to study fiscal reform to get at the problem
of ongoing deficits. Davis can veto spending items when the budget
reaches him. Other cuts can be made after the budget passes.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Elizabeth Cordova and increasing numbers of others
will suffer. It's time to get the checks in the mail.</TE>

<LD>Thailand's health minister is urging stores to stop selling giant
African cockroaches, warning that the popular pets could become a
health risk if let loose.</LD>
<LD>   Thai newspapers report that businessmen have brought Madagascar
hissing cockroaches from Africa and are selling them as pets for
$1.19 apiece in Bangkok.</LD>
<LD>   Minister Sudarat Keyuraphun said the 2 1/2-inch bugs breed
quickly, with 40 to 60 offspring in 60 days. They live up to three
years, so if they escape, they will be very difficult to control, she
said.</LD>

<LD>George Pell, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney, announced that

boy while training as a priest 41 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Pell was accused of molesting the boy in Melbourne in 1961, the
church said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Pell, Australia's most senior cleric, denied the allegations and
announced that he would take a leave while an independent
investigation was conducted. The church appointed a retired Supreme
Court judge, who is not a Catholic, to investigate the allegations.</LD>

<LD>A tax on plastic shopping bags raised $3.45 million in its first
three months and has slashed use of the bags 90%, the government
said.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Ireland introduced a 15-cent surcharge on every plastic
bag dispensed by shops. The program, which aims to reduce waste and
litter, is being closely watched by other countries, with authorities
in Britain and the U.S. expressing interest in copying it.</LD>
<LD>   Before the tax, it was estimated that Ireland's 3.9 million people
were using 1.2 billion bags a year.</LD>

<LD>South Korea said it would repatriate a North Korean after learning

and wants to return home.</LD>
<LD>   Ri Kyong Sung, 33, reportedly was found tied up in the engine room
of a fishing boat that carried him and 20 other North Koreans to the
South on Monday. "I have parents, a wife and kids in the North. I
have no reason to come to the South," the Chosun Ilbo newspaper
quoted Ri as saying.</LD>
<LD>   The other defectors told investigators that they tricked Ri, the
chief engineer on the boat, to go south. South Korea planned to send
him back today through the border village of Panmunjom.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A school caretaker was charged Tuesday with the murders of two
10-year-old girls whose disappearance from an English village has
dominated the news for two weeks and shocked much of the country.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they had charged Ian Huntley, 28, with the murders of
Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. Hours later, they charged his
girlfriend, Maxine Carr, with attempting to obstruct justice. Carr,
25, was a teaching assistant at the girls school in Soham, in eastern
England. She had been arrested Saturday at the same time as Huntley
on suspicion of murder.</LD>
<LD>   Det. Chief Inspector Andy Hebb of the Cambridgeshire police said
Huntley had undergone a series of medical examinations and had been
transferred to a secure unit under mental health laws.</LD>
<TE>   At Rampton psychiatric hospital in Nottinghamshire, Dr. Mike
Harris said a 28-year-old patient had been admitted for assessment
because of concerns about his fitness to be questioned by police.
Huntley will not appear until he is deemed fit to attend, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Carr remained in custody pending her appearance today at
Peterborough Magistrates Court. The children's bodies were found
Saturday near the U.S. air base of Lakenheath, seven miles from
Soham, but examinations failed to reveal the cause of death.</TE>

<HD>Chechen Rebels Downed Craft, Russia Believes</HD>
<DH>Military: Investigators find a missile launcher near crash
scene. Death toll in disaster involving giant helicopter is 114.
Thirty-three survived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian officials believe that Chechen rebels shot down a giant
Russian military helicopter, killing 114 people in an attack that saw
the worst battle casualties since Russia's 1999 invasion of Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   Survivors in a hospital Tuesday described a flash and a bang near
the engine and a noxious black cloud before the MI-26 helicopter
crashed Monday evening outside the Chechen capital, Grozny.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials investigating the crash reportedly found a
launcher for a Strela antiaircraft missile--the Russian version of a
Stinger--near the scene.</LD>
<TE>   Russian Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, who flew from Moscow
to the crash site, said the most likely cause was an attack by
Chechen rebels, who earlier claimed responsibility for shooting down
the chopper.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials confirmed that the MI-26 was shot down by a
shoulder-held Strela, according to Interfax news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Ustinov said that all possible causes, including technical
failure, were being investigated but that "the version of shooting of
the helicopter from the ground is the main one."</TE>
<TE>   The MI-26, the world's largest helicopter, is nicknamed the
korova, or "cow," by Russia's military because of its bulk. It looms
about 26 feet high and 110 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   No other attack by Chechen rebels in the present conflict has
claimed so many victims. Russian forces invaded the republic in 1999
after a 1994-96 war failed to crush separatist rebels.</TE>
<TE>   On Russia's TVS news, the anchorman solemnly read a list of the
surnames of the dead, among whom were four colonels and 17 other
officers, but by Tuesday night relatives still had received no
official news that their loved ones had perished.</TE>
<TE>   Tatyana Solovyov, mother of Yevgeny Solovyov, 20, of Moscow, had
no idea that her son died. She had barely followed news of the crash
because of a broken television.</TE>
<TE>   He managed for two years to dodge the draft but was conscripted
last December.</TE>
<TE>   "Zhenya never wanted to be there," she said, weeping. "Who will
tell me--what did my son die for? My body and my soul have never been
in greater pain than today.</TE>
<TE>   "If they tell me he is no longer alive, that he died in that
helicopter, I will go mad. I just cannot imagine that my sonny no
longer breathes, that he is no longer alive, that he will never wake
up to see the morning sun."</TE>
<TE>   Her son called her 10 days earlier  to tell her he was about to be
sent to Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the purpose of this war? It has been going on for years
now, but with no progress. How many more Russian boys will get killed
for nothing--for something that we do not even understand? This is a
nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   The victims were conscripts, contract soldiers and officers flying
to the strife-torn republic in the Caucasus for tours of duty.
Thirty-three people survived the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei V. Borisov, 46, father of a conscript, Boris Borisov, 20,
of Severomorsk in the northern Murmansk region, was angry that
military officials had many times claimed that Chechnya was free of
rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult for me to talk--my hands are trembling. Can you
imagine finding out something like that about your son on national
TV?</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know what it feels like to lose a child--a feeling you
cannot compare to anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always been negative about this whole war in Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential envoy in southern Russia, Viktor Kazantsev,
strode into a hospital ward in Rostov-on-Don on Tuesday and quizzed
survivors about whether they saw a flash before the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a flash on the right side, near the engine, then a pop
and then we were covered with a kerosene cloud, a black kerosene
cloud, you know, and then I lost consciousness in the fire," replied
a survivor, Sergei Shishayev, thickly bandaged on his head and arm,
in an exchange aired on RTR television.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot had to crash-land in a minefield, forcing a delay in
rescue efforts as a sapper team cleared a path for emergency workers.
The chopper's large rear hatch jammed closed, trapping many inside
the burning wreck.</TE>
<TE>   The MI-26 was at 1,000 feet Monday evening, approaching to land at
Russian military headquarters in Khankala near Grozny, when the pilot
reported an engine fire.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring Russian vulnerability in Chechnya, the military
Tuesday banned flights of the giant MI-26 in the region. It also
banned future transport of personnel in the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The Kavkaz Center Web site, which represents Chechen rebel forces,
posted reports Monday and Tuesday claiming that the attack was
carefully planned by a special rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a heavy commitment over many years, the Russian military
has not managed to grind down the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Russians die each year in attacks by the guerrillas,
who have spurned Russian rule since the early 1990s and fought for
independence since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin declared a national day of
mourning Thursday over the casualties, which surpassed the death toll
of 84 paratroopers, mostly from the northwestern city of Pskov, who
were killed in a bloody battle in winter 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov said 147 people were
aboard the helicopter, including a military nurse and her child, who
both died.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Embassy Siege Defused in Germany</HD>
<DH>Europe: No shots are fired as police storm building where
five foes of Baghdad regime had managed to enter and seize four
hostages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Police special forces stormed the Iraqi Embassy here late Tuesday,
ending a five-hour siege by opponents of President Saddam Hussein's
regime who had seized four hostages and had declared their assault
"the first step toward the liberation of our beloved fatherland."</LD>
<LD>   Five members of a little-known group calling itself the Democratic
Iraqi Opposition of Germany slipped by German guards outside the
elegant mission to dramatize their determination to topple the
Hussein regime, according to a faxed statement sent to news agencies.
Their hostages included Iraq's senior diplomat here.</LD>
<LD>   But the assailants gave up without a shot fired as soon as police
moved in. The operation lasted less than five minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "At 7:40 p.m., the building was entered and five people were
arrested. Two [hostages] were injured but only lightly," police
spokeswoman Christine Rother said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident brought an international conflict into a usually
quiet western Berlin neighborhood, spotlighting the growing tensions
here over President Bush's threat to attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and German officials as well as the numerous Kurdish and
Iraqi exile groups in Germany have been mired in debate for weeks
about the level of Berlin's commitment to Bush's declared war against
terrorism. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder this month warned
Washington that his nation was not prepared to get involved in any
"military adventure" against Iraq, contending that such action would
need United Nations backing and could undermine the search for peace
in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The hostage-takers made clear that they were aiming to convince
Germans of the need to get rid of Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "This first step against the terrorist regime of Saddam Hussein
and his killers, which is taking place with a peaceful purpose, is
intended to make the German people, organizations and political
powers understand that our people have a desire to be free and will
act on it," the group warned in the statement faxed from Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   The group's decision to use force to highlight the plight of
Hussein's opponents prompted fears of other pressure tactics from the
exile community here. It also drew rebuke, even from other critics of
the Baghdad regime.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
that the Bush administration condemned the hostage-taking and that it
was unfamiliar with the group that staged the assault.</TE>
<TE>   "Actions like this takeover are unacceptable," Fleischer said.
"They undermine legitimate efforts by Iraqis both inside and outside
Iraq to bring regime change to Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the group's members were not viewed as freedom fighters,
Fleischer said the United States adheres to the belief that illegal
intrusions into other nations' embassies are unacceptable, "even
against a regime that is as evil as Iraq's."</TE>
<TE>   But some saw the hand of Washington in the siege, even though
police suggested that it was the work of distraught amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly they have been pushed by somebody else, some government
perhaps," Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Douri,
told reporters in New York. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry in Baghdad
blamed the attack on "armed terrorists of the American and Zionist
intelligence mercenaries."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the police barricades erected two blocks from the embassy,
Iraqi exiles gathered with journalists and passersby to watch the
muted drama unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are even saying it could be a CIA-inspired act to get
Germany into a war against Hussein," said Amir Abbas, an Iraqi who
said he has lived in Germany since 1979. "I know Schroeder is now
saying he is against a war, but that is only until the elections are
over."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's challengers in the Sept. 22 elections have made
similar claims--that his opposition to backing U.S. action against
Iraq is electioneering, as Germans are largely opposed to further
military deployments abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of police cordoned off the embassy block in the
Zehlendorf district while sharpshooters and masked special forces
took positions outside the villa, which opened July 17 when the Iraqi
government moved its mission from the former German capital, Bonn.</TE>
<TE>   Mediators sought to make contact with the captors through the wife
of Iraqi Charge d'Affaires Shamil Mohammed, the top diplomat seized.
But officials were still unsure of the captors' demands when word
came that police had been authorized by the Iraqi government to enter
embassy territory and bring the incident to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The assailants had released two of the hostages, a man and a
woman, to the care of emergency medical workers before police got
permission to move on the building. One hostage had suffered a minor
respiratory ailment induced by an aerosol irritant the assailants
used to gain entry to the compound, and the other had a panic attack,
said police spokesman Joerg Nittmann.</TE>
<TE>   There were unconfirmed reports that two shots were fired during
the siege.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab television network Al Jazeera, monitored in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates, broadcast what it said was a telephone interview with
one of the captors.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not occupying the embassy. We are liberating this piece of
Iraqi soil. We're doing this to highlight the desire of the Iraqi
people for liberty and freedom," the male voice stated, adding that
the occupation was calm and nonviolent.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how many supporters had entered the embassy, he replied: "We
are 22 million."</TE>
<TE>   In London, a spokesman for the opposition Iraqi National Congress
said the action was conducted by a fringe group and in violation of
the INC's objective of forcing a change in leadership in Baghdad
without causing violence in third countries.</TE>

<HD>Europeans Grapple With Flood Mess</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Fear of disease and chemical contamination
lingers as waters recede. Meanwhile, downpour continues in Asia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Flood waters were receding across much of Central Europe on Tuesday,
leaving the stench of debris and the fear of disease and chemical
leaks from factories damaged in the region's worst natural disaster
in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of people have died in storms and flooding in Germany,
Austria and the Czech Republic--and also in Russia--sparked by weeks
of heavy rain. Hundreds of thousands more have been driven from their
homes, crops have been ruined and buildings and roads destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of tons of rubbish were piling up in Prague, the Czech
capital, as about 20,000 cleanup workers in the nation were being
offered hepatitis vaccinations, health official Michael Vit said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Czech officials said a flooded chemical factory could still pose a
threat to the environment after leaking poisonous chlorine gas last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Czech and German environment ministers toured the Spolana chemical
plant in Neratovice, 12 miles north of Prague, to assess the risk of
leaks into the Elbe River, which flows north into Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Apart from Spolana, the other problem was the destruction of
sewage treatment plants on the Elbe," German Environment Minister
Juergen Trittin said. "Both sides agree that it is necessary to renew
the operation of the plants as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   His Czech counterpart, Libor Ambrozek, said preliminary tests at
the site have shown no dioxin or mercury leaks, but he added that
final tests for dioxin would only be ready later this week.</TE>
<TE>   As Europe embarked on cleanup efforts, Asia braced for more
flooding. Fast-rising waters in a huge lake in southern China were
threatening to engulf millions of people as a tropical storm dumped
rain on the region.</TE>
<TE>   China's second-largest freshwater lake, Dongting, is already at
110 feet, more than 5 feet over the flood warning level. The lake, in
Hunan province, is expected to rise as rain-swollen rivers pour into
it, state television said.</TE>
<TE>   Dongting--spanning about 1,080 square miles--sits just south of
the flood-prone Yangtze River, and thousands of miles of embankments
around it shield more than 10 million people and 1.6 million acres of
farmland, the official China Daily newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   Tropical storm Vongfong was expected to dump torrential rain on
parts of Hunan and to swell the Xiangjiang River--one of four feeding
into Dongting--one Hunan official said. Thousands had been mobilized
to reinforce embankments around the lake.</TE>

<HD>8 Filipinos Kidnapped by Rebels</HD>
<DH>Asia: The door-to-door makeup salespeople are snatched on
Jolo island, a guerrilla stronghold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PATIKUL, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels kidnapped eight door-to-door Avon
cosmetics salespeople, Philippine officials said today.</LD>
<LD>   Esmon Suhuri, vice mayor of the town of Patikul on Jolo island,
said the five women and three men, all Filipinos, were kidnapped
Tuesday afternoon. He said the victims were both Christians and
Muslims, and he blamed Abu Sayyaf. Jolo is known as an Abu Sayyaf
stronghold.</LD>
<LD>   The abductions are the first believed to be linked to Abu Sayyaf
since about 1,000 U.S. troops began arriving in the southern
Philippines in January to train the army to better combat the
guerrilla group.</LD>
<TE>   The exercise ended three weeks ago, although a few Americans are
remaining to complete infrastructure projects on nearby Basilan
island.</TE>
<TE>   Suhuri said the army was shelling suspected Abu Sayyaf hide-outs
around Patikul late Tuesday. The fighting was the first this year in
the war-stricken area.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have often kidnapped for ransom but more frequently
have abducted poor Filipinos to serve for weeks or months as slave
labor. Many of the slaves have been released, but more than a dozen
have been killed in the last year, some beheaded. The group has also
kidnapped women to force them to marry guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Jolo is about 50 miles southwest of Basilan, where U.S. Green
Berets were training the Philippine Special Forces fighting Abu
Sayyaf rebels there.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf seized 102 hostages, including three Americans, in a
yearlong kidnapping rampage that ended in June when U.S.-trained
soldiers, helped by American surveillance and communications, tracked
down rebels holding the last of those captives: American missionaries
Gracia and Martin Burnham and Philippine nurse Deborah Yap. Soldiers
rescued Gracia Burnham, but her husband and Yap were killed.</TE>

<HD>A Tattoo Master's Eerie Fan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>While the Japanese art of full-body tattooing has many foreign fans,
one of the most infamous must certainly be Charles Manson.</LD>
<LD>   In a dusty glass case at the back of the Yokohama Tattoo Museum
are page after page of letters written by Manson to Horiyoshi III,
the working name of museum founder Yoshihito Nakano.</LD>
<LD>   Manson was convicted in 1971 in the bloody Tate-LaBianca murders,
a notorious crime that left a jarring memory on a generation.</LD>
<TE>   Nakano says Manson started writing to him as "a sort of pen pal"
after reading about his work in a tattoo magazine. Nakano says he
never did work on Manson.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the letters are from Corcoran Prison in 1995 and were
written on colored paper featuring swastikas or eagle-and-swastika
combinations. Manson's prison number is listed as B33920.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the letters are filled with spelling and
grammatical errors. Words skip from lower case to upper case and back
again, lines tail off in different directions, and the sentiments
expressed don't follow conventional logic. Manson at one point writes
that he feels a link with the "100% Japan man."</TE>
<TE>   On one three-page letter on white paper, with eagles and swastikas
at the top left and right, Manson writes: "Looking DEEP, LONG, now
becomeing wonder in the mind Now is when as its always been writen in
the SUN. Right ON. I been comeing HOLY WAR as Gods Marks say behold
words. Nows the 1940s Hall of prisons in the USA. When behind the
judges chambers the English words came that Japan was to be hung for
crimes. Then Crime became the war behind the merrows of minds in
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Nakano says he doesn't read English and never understood the
letters.</TE>

<HD>Fox Plugs Bill for Energy Reform</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Mexico's president faces a power struggle in
Congress over electricity privatization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Warning that an energy crisis looms, President Vicente Fox has asked
a reluctant Congress to allow private companies to generate and sell
electricity in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   An energy bill, received by the Senate this week, is one of the
president's top legislative priorities and a test of his ability to
deliver economic change. It is opposed by lawmakers who have already
blocked much of the free-market agenda that helped Fox win election
two summers ago, ending 71 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</LD>
<LD>   Fox has been touring the country over the last week, appealing
directly to the public to nudge Congress behind the initiative.
Critics say it would surrender a strategic national resource to
private control, including foreign interests.</LD>
<TE>   "We're embarking on a great debate, and I hope we will resolve it
positively, as other countries have already done--without losing our
sovereignty over this resource but supplementing it with private
investment," Fox told an audience Monday in Cancun.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say Mexico needs $56 billion by 2009 to modernize and
expand its electricity sector. Unless private investors contribute
most of that money, they say, power generation could fall short of
demand within three years, causing blackouts and stifling economic
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said this week that the bill
could assure needed investment. It would amend the Mexican
Constitution to allow private companies to compete with the public
Federal Electricity Commission to supply large industrial consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise," he said, lawmakers "had better be vigilant that
Mexico is not left castrated in its energy needs in the future and
that their children and my grandchildren aren't left to lead a
country that is half-lighted."</TE>
<TE>   The state has a near-monopoly on the generation, sale and
distribution of electricity. In April, the Supreme Court struck down
a government effort to liberalize the energy market by decree,
prompting Fox to order up the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the measure stems from a nationalist belief that
electric energy, like Mexico's vast oil and gas reserves, should
remain entirely in state hands. Critics argue that ill-conceived
privatization schemes have disrupted energy production in other Latin
American countries and in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the country there are poor communities that do not have
electricity, and if private interests take over they never will,"
said Marti Batres, a legislator from the Democratic Revolution Party,
or PRD. "We need more state funds for energy production."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators from Batres' left-of-center party and the PRI, which
together have a majority in Congress, have vowed to fight Fox's bill.
Both opposition parties have offered proposals for reforming the
debt-burdened electricity commission without resorting to private
investors.</TE>
<TE>   But PRI legislators are divided over the government bill, and Fox
is hoping to persuade enough of them to go along to muster the
necessary two-thirds vote in both chambers.</TE>
<TE>   A 1992 law opened up power generation to the private sector but
limited investors to building plants for self-supply. It also
permitted, in special cases, foreign investment in power generation
for export to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   That law has attracted about $10 billion in private investment but
not enough to keep up with Mexico's demand for power, which is
growing at 5.5% a year. Fox has argued that the billions of dollars
needed for new generators could be better spent improving schools and
health care.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Madrazo, president of the PRI, said Monday that the
opposition should not reject Fox's bill without serious study and
debate. "We have to think about the long-term good of the country,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other politicians said Fox submitted the bill knowing that it
would be defeated but hoping to portray opposition parties as
obstructionist villains ahead of next year's congressional elections.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Shootings Mar Start of Mideast Security Deal</HD>
<DH>Conflict: An Israeli soldier and two Palestinians are
killed in the West Bank and Gaza. Arafat's forces begin patrols in
Bethlehem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Two Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were killed in separate
incidents Tuesday as violence marred the first day of a security
arrangement designed to lead to a truce after nearly two years of
fighting.</LD>
<LD>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli undercover soldiers
shot and killed the brother of a radical Palestinian leader after he
fired at them first, the military said.</LD>
<LD>   In the Gaza Strip, a Hamas sniper killed an Israeli soldier
guarding a Jewish settlement, and the Palestinian militant group said
it would undermine the security deal. Soldiers later killed a
15-year-old Palestinian boy in the same area after Israel sent attack
helicopters to search for the sniper.</LD>
<TE>   As the security arrangement took effect, Palestinian police
patrolled the West Bank city of Bethlehem for the first time in more
than two months. Israel, which had pulled out of Bethlehem, is also
to turn the Gaza Strip over to Palestinian security and pledges
further easing of restrictions if violence is halted.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ramallah slaying, Israeli special forces disguised as Arabs
shot and killed Mohammed Saadat, brother of Ahmed Saadat, leader of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the soldiers stormed the house, Mohammed Saadat's
bullet-riddled body lay on the ground behind the building. Angry
neighbors and relatives shouted and threw rocks at the Israelis, who
fired rifles into the air to disperse the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The military said the Israelis intended to arrest Saadat, but he
opened fire, wounding two soldiers, and other soldiers killed him.
The statement said Saadat was an "active member" of the Popular
Front.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Saadat has been in Palestinian custody since May 1 as part
of a deal that ended a 34-day siege of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Ramallah headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem's Palestinians ventured out onto their streets without
looking for Israeli soldiers for the first time since June.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the eight main Palestinian towns and cities are still under
Israeli control, after a large-scale invasion in mid-June that
followed back-to-back suicide bombings in Jerusalem. The Israelis say
that if Palestinian security prevents terrorist attacks in Bethlehem
and Gaza, Israel will ease restrictions in the other West Bank
locations.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Terrorist Is Dead, Iraq Confirms</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Abu Nidal killed himself, deputy premier says. The
U.S. welcomes the news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz confirmed Tuesday that
Palestinian guerrilla commander and terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal
had died in Baghdad, saying he had killed himself.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, I confirm his suicide, and an official will give you full
details Wednesday," Aziz told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, two senior Palestinian officials said Abu Nidal--who
had targeted Israelis, Palestine Liberation Organization figures, and
Arab officials who sought rapprochement with Israel--had been found
dead of gunshot wounds three days earlier in his Baghdad home.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian officials suggested that Abu Nidal had committed
suicide, but they did not explain how he could have shot himself
several times. The way he died raised suspicions that he may have
been assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad's confirmation of Abu Nidal's death came amid claims that
he recently held talks with Saudi and Kuwaiti intelligence agents.</TE>
<TE>   The claims, made Tuesday by a Palestinian official in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, were rejected by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Nidal was blamed for terrorist attacks that killed or injured
hundreds of people, mostly during the 1970s and 1980s. The U.S.
welcomed his death. In Crawford, Texas, White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer described him Tuesday as "one of the most craven and
despicable terrorists in the world .... He will not be missed."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Cleans Up Notorious Prison</HD>
<DH>Justice: Truckloads of convicts are transferred from
facility basically run by inmate gangs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>About 1,500 federal police officers, with helicopters watching
overhead, entered La Mesa penitentiary Tuesday to handcuff and
transfer 2,000 prisoners, beginning a program to transform a prison
so loosely run that some inmates built their own homes and stores
inside, and even lived there with their families.</LD>
<LD>   The most dangerous convicted murderers, drug traffickers and other
inmates from La Mesa were herded onto buses and trucks and driven to
a new prison in El Hongo, a small town 60 miles east of Tijuana. A
spokesman for the state of Baja California said 43 prisoners
considered leaders of a drug distribution network that operated
inside and outside the Mexican prison were dispersed to other
maximum-security prisons.</LD>
<LD>   State officials said they would immediately begin to raze the
center of the prison, called El Pueblito, or The Little Town. There,
wealthier inmates built more than 400 homes, some equipped with
computers, phones, DVD players and bars. The plan is to turn La Mesa
into a conventional state prison--with cellblocks, no frills and no
family--for the more than 3,000 inmates who will remain.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of women and children who had lived inside were escorted
out Tuesday, carrying their belongings. The families were taken
aboard buses to a temporary shelter installed at a local auditorium,
and officials promised to try to find housing for them.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 children who have no known guardian except for the inmate
each lived with were taken away by state social workers.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, about 15 minutes' drive from the U.S., was basically
run by inmate gangs. Previous plans to clean it up were never
executed because of fears of rioting and reportedly because prisoners
paid kickbacks to prevent change.</TE>

<HD>Leading Figures in Rise and Collapse of Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are some of the key players in the Enron Corp. saga, former
executives who are expected to figure large in the ongoing federal
investigations into the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   * Kenneth L. Lay. He built the company from an obscure natural gas
pipeline firm into a new kind of energy company. He was chief
executive from 1985 to February 2001 and remained chairman until the
company's collapse. He stepped back in as CEO in August 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Lay, 60, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of
Houston, saw the promise of natural gas deregulation in the 1980s and
electricity deregulation in the 1990s. Enriched by Enron's early
successes, he became a big political fund-raiser, an advisor to both
Bush administrations and an architect of national energy policy.</LD>
<TE>   Through Enron's stunning downward spiral, two views of Lay emerge:
He was an isolated statesman, unaware of financial trickery
perpetrated by underlings. Or he was a hands-on manager who knew what
was going on.</TE>
<TE>   Lay has refused to testify before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   * Jeffrey K. Skilling. He took over as chief executive in February
2001, only to resign in August, citing personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, 48, said the decision to quit had "nothing to do" with
Enron, but many in and out of the company wondered why he would walk
away from a job he had long coveted.</TE>
<TE>   Lay brought Skilling to Enron in 1990 from consulting firm
McKinsey &amp; Co., at which Skilling had handled the Enron account.
Enron had hit a rough patch because of plummeting natural gas prices,
and Skilling had a vision of Enron as a nimble trading company that
didn't need hard assets to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling was named Enron's president in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling signed off on the creation of many of the
off-balance-sheet financial deals that Enron allegedly used to hide
debt. Skilling has insisted that the deals were legitimate and were
used to lower risk for Enron and its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony before Congress this year, Skilling said he was
unaware of any accounting problems at the company.</TE>
<TE>   * Andrew S. Fastow. He joined Enron in 1990 from Continental Bank
in Chicago and became chief financial officer in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, 40, helped Enron raise the huge sums it needed in its
quest to dominate energy trading. He is believed to have engineered
Enron's many off-balance-sheet financial partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow managed two of the partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2
Co-Investment, named using the initials of his two children and his
wife. Investor concern over potential conflicts between Fastow's role
as an Enron executive and as a partnership manager caused Fastow to
resign his manager duties in summer 2001.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a surprise $638-million quarterly loss,
partly related to the partnerships that also cost the company $1.2
billion in shareholder equity. On Oct. 24, a day after Lay expressed
"the highest faith and confidence in Andy" in a conference call with
investors and analysts, Fastow was ousted from the job.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has said Fastow reaped at least $30 million in fees for
managing the partnerships. A Fastow spokesman has said the
arrangements were created with the full knowledge and approval of
Enron's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   * Jeffrey McMahon. He was mentioned in Enron executive Sherron S.
Watkins' Aug. 22 memo to Lay as one of the top executives that Lay
should quiz to see whether her account of financial shenanigans was
true.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, 41, a former Arthur Andersen employee who joined Enron in
1994, was treasurer and executive vice president of finance in 2000
when he complained about the off-the-books deals that Fastow helped
engineer. McMahon then moved to an Enron backwater as president of a
small subsidiary that served industrial customers.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Deaf to Health Fund Crisis" (editorial, Aug. 18), about California
medical care, is appropriate. However, this is like shooting BB guns
when The Times should be using guided missiles. I believe it to be
the moral duty of all who have a public forum to harangue our
lawmakers. A never-ending barrage should be used to make them realize
there must be a national health program.</LD>
<LD>   Robert S. Ellison MD</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for keeping before our eyes the approaching tsunami of
closures and cutbacks in health-care services threatening all of us
in L.A. County. Who knows when or where any of us will be in need of
emergency medical treatment? A few minutes may mean the difference
between life and death. Your editorial states that "closing county
hospitals and clinics would overwhelm private hospitals and undermine
the already fragile trauma-care system," leaving us all vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Please help us yank the president and the governor from their
fund-raising troughs to address this crisis. I support the county
Board of Supervisors' small steps to address the problem. As a
property owner I am willing to share the expense of protecting the
lives of those who live in or pass through our county. But we also
need state and federal help.</TE>

<LD>Re "Heston Faces His Illness Squarely," Aug. 18: It is unpleasant to
hear that anyone has Alzheimer's. But the outpouring of sympathy for
Charlton Heston is larger than he deserves. How many millions of guns
has he sold, or made it possible for people to buy? How many
thousands of Americans might be alive today had he used his influence
to remove rather than put guns in our hands and homes?</LD>
<LD>   When the next depressed kid shoots himself with his dad's handy
revolver, will Moses weep? When the next drunken, angry husband
shoots his wife with his handy pistol, will he weep? When the next
sick boy enters his school's cafeteria with his dad's handy guns and
shoots down other kids, will he weep?</LD>

<LD>"No Blinders on Education" (editorial, Aug. 17) is hypocrisy at the
extreme. You close the editorial with these words: "To broaden their
world view, students [at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill) should read the Koran." Substitute the word "Bible" for "Koran"
in that sentence and The Times' headline would be shouting that such
a reading assignment is a constitutional violation of the separation
of church and state.</LD>

<HD>California Budget Doesn't Add Up</HD>

<LD>Columnist George Skelton is wrong in saying that taxes should be
raised on the rich to make up for state budget shortfalls ("Raking in
Millions? State Should Raise Your Taxes," Aug. 19). The state budget
grew by 36% the last three years, well above the growth in population
and inflation. If spending growth had simply followed the combined
rate of inflation and population growth, the budget would still be
21.8% larger than it was when Gov. Gray Davis took office. But
instead of all the proposed tax increases just to get the budget
balanced, we would instead have a $38.2-billion surplus.</LD>
<LD>   Doing as Skelton suggests will simply cause the same problems
later on. Sending more money to the bottomless pit in Sacramento
solves nothing. Keeping money in the hands of the taxpayers does. If
the politicians don't have the money, they can't spend it, and we'll
all be better off.</LD>

<TE>   Skelton makes a painfully obvious point when he says we need to
help reduce a $24-billion state revenue shortfall by a two-year raise
on the state income tax rates on the 2.3% of the state's highest
income earners. Anyone who objects to this on the grounds that
spending should be cut instead should be required to specifically say
what those cuts should be.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who says it is just another example of "class warfare"
should be required to explain why a short-term tax increase on those
who are most able to pay it is pitting classes against each other.
Those who think the tax increase will happen in light of how
politicians get their campaign funds need to have their heads
examined.</TE>

<TE>   "Assembly GOP Leader Hones Balancing Act" (Aug. 18) left me
troubled. It portrayed Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox as a tough
politician and effective legislator. Reality demonstrates otherwise.
Fifty days have passed, and there is still no state budget. According
to the California Department of Finance, the state is losing $3
million a day because of the Assembly's inability to compromise on a
budget. The governor's office puts that loss at $15 million a day.
More important, thousands of citizens, including the elderly and
disabled, are being hurt because the state--without a budget--doesn't
have authority to pay many of its bills. In light of these facts, it
is inappropriate to praise any member of the Assembly, let alone one
of its leaders.</TE>

<LD>Obviously, the Israeli army thought that a civilian Palestinian with
a bulletproof vest would be a safe courier of an offer for a wanted
Hamas terrorist to surrender ("Israeli Court Bans Use of 'Human
Shields,' " Aug. 19). It was wrong, and the terrorist shot and killed
the young man. Subsequently an Israeli court has placed an injunction
on this behavior.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, no Palestinian court has ever placed an injunction on
mass murder of Israeli civilians by terrorists. No suicide bomber has
ever made an offer of surrender rather than of death to his victims.
No Arab combatant has ever tried to avoid Israeli civilian death in
any way, shape or form. Sometimes, we miss the forest for the trees.</LD>

terrific example of community involvement that rabbis Chaim Kolodny
and Shmuel Manne set by sleuthing and capturing the Hancock Park rape
suspect. And they want to use any reward to buy defibrillators for
their nonprofit group! Who says there are no heroes anymore?

<HD>Arguing the Morality of Preventive War</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Schlesinger Jr. says it well in his Aug. 15 commentary, "The
Immorality of Preventive War": "Unilateral preventive war is neither
legitimate nor moral." He argues that aggression by Iraq would play
into American hands to give reason for attack and a regime change.
Being an aggressor has not been the American way, and such an
aggressive action by the U.S. would surely undermine our moral
standing in the world. As a people and a nation, our country's
greatness has usually been enhanced when we are peace-seeking and
working for the common good. We are diminished by actions that are
destructive and aggressive.</LD>
<LD>   And, if we go to war against Iraq, are we prepared for the
ramifications--not just of casualties but also of what we will do to
help rebuild a stable society? Do we have the resources to do that
single-handedly? Aren't we still struggling in another war, the war
on terrorism? A war against Iraq will take away resources needed to
help finish what we are doing in Afghanistan. We may not be for
"peace at any cost"; however, we are not for war at the cost of
undermining our moral integrity as a nation and at the risk of losing
ground in our legitimate aims.</LD>

<TE>   Schlesinger is one of our country's most respected historians.
However, after reading his commentary, I find that he remains in a
9/11 world. The greatest gift our country can give the Iraqi people
and the entire world is the removal of Saddam Hussein from the
control of the vast arsenal of weapons in Iraq. We owe it to the
generations of Americans who have fought to keep our nation and the
world safe from despots.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein, I am confident, was given a copy of the commentary and
laughed at how naive we Americans remain after 9/11. The whole world
collectively condemned Israel when then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin
sent its air force to destroy Hussein's nuclear capability in 1981.
But 10 years after that, the coalition forces sent to free Kuwait did
not have to confront a nuclear-armed enemy. Our government will also
be condemned when we free Iraq of Hussein. But it is the legitimate
thing to do, and it would be immoral not to take action.</TE>

<LD>Re "Archdiocese for Years Kept Claims of Abuse From Police," Aug. 18:
After reading your Sunday Report, I am beyond outrage and disgust.
The Catholic Church is without a doubt a criminal entity,
deliberately uncooperative with police in prosecuting priests who
molested children. Indictments and convictions must necessarily
follow. Church officials have aided, abetted, obstructed justice and
broken every civil and criminal law in the books and yet they
continue to be empowered by our criminal-coddling society.</LD>
<LD>   Enough is enough! How many more young lives does this church have
to destroy in the name of protecting its precious name and
reputation? It is time to bring the hierarchy in Rome to its knees to
beg forgiveness from the rest of the world for its crimes against
humanity.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While it is a small percentage of Catholic priests who have
sexually molested children in their care, it is the entire leadership
of the Catholic Church that is hypocritical and immoral. Instead of
protecting the most vulnerable, these leaders have inexplicably made
the calculated decision to protect the abusers rather than the
abused.</TE>
<TE>   Pedophile priests should be in jail just as any other citizen
would be for engaging in this criminal behavior. Mahony should help
the police put them there. May heaven help the children, because the
current Catholic leaders have not and will not.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Green</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As I observe the current turmoil of the Catholic Church regarding
the scandal of priestly abuse and hierarchical cover-up shattering
the peace within the church, I am reminded of the words of Pope Paul
VI: "If you want peace, work for justice."</TE>
<TE>   Here in Los Angeles, I continue to sense that the hierarchy of my
church is desperately seeking to reestablish that peace with what
appear to be quick solutions, and not necessarily working for
justice, coupled with long-term institutional change. Sadly, I wonder
if this is not driven more by the opening of the new cathedral within
just weeks, rather than doing what is right.</TE>
<TE>   Before peace can be restored within the Catholic Church, the
hierarchy must fully accept the fact that until all the victims of
abuse have found justice, and all the perpetrators of these crimes,
along with their complicit superiors (priests, bishops and
cardinals), have been brought to justice, there can be no real and
true peace within the Catholic Church--at least not the kind that
Jesus spoke about.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Office of Education will launch an
investigation into allegations of widespread mismanagement in the
county education system made by two teachers at a Canoga Park school
for juvenile offenders.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations, detailed in a study conducted by the teachers
during the last five years, were announced Tuesday at a news
conference in front of the county administration building in downtown
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In a prepared statement, the Office of Education said it was
"proud of its accomplishments and stands by its record of providing
services and programs to public school districts throughout Los
Angeles County."</LD>
<TE>   The agency will "present a response to the complaint after it has
had a full opportunity to carefully review and study it," according
to the statement, which also said the agency would investigate "the
specific allegations or assertions that have been made."</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Education oversees schools that serve a total of
50,000 students. The students include juvenile offenders, those with
special education needs, pregnant teens and youths who have been
expelled from one of the 81 school districts in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers Paul White and Robert McGill of the West Valley
Leadership Academy in Canoga Park allege that the county spends too
much money on administrators and not enough on attracting qualified
teachers or improving its facilities. As a result, too many
inexperienced teachers with little direction are employed at school
sites where they fear for their safety, the two say.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers' report also partly blames the county for the death
of Michael Urquidi, a 17-year-old juvenile offender who was killed in
a drive-by shooting outside the West Valley Leadership Academy on
Jan. 8. The teachers say the death could have been prevented if a
security guard had been stationed at the school. The study cites an
agreement between the county and the city of Los Angeles that
requires a security guard to be on site starting a half-hour before
school and ending an hour after school.</TE>
<TE>   "A security guard could have made the difference," said Michael's
mother, Sally Urquidi, who stood by White and McGill at the news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   In its written statement, the county said that it "took all
necessary steps to ensure the safety of students" at the West Valley
Leadership Academy. A spokesman for the Office of Education would not
comment on whether a security guard was present or required to be
present at the school at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   White and McGill are hoping that their study will encourage the
state to examine the county agency. Copies of their report have been
mailed to the two candidates running in the November election for
state superintendent of public instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Katherine H. Smith of Anaheim said she could not comment
because she had not seen the report, but was interested in learning
about it. Her opponent, state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis
Obispo), did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Bogus Cashier's Checks at O.C. Jail Trigger New Policy for
Posting Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a reputed gang member was bailed out of Orange County Jail
through the use of bogus cashier's checks, jail officials have
decided they'll no longer accept such checks for posting bond unless
a bank guarantees the funds.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the incident, jailers will accept only cash or
cashier's checks during routine banking hours so the funds can be
verified, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Dominic Peter Rizzo, 33, was being held on attempted murder
charges when a friend paid his $500,000 bail July 17.</LD>
<TE>   The unidentified man, who gave the jailer a fake name, said he was
a friend of Rizzo's and presented two $250,000 checks to the jailer.</TE>
<TE>   "The checks appeared to be good, and by law we have to take
certain tenders," Amormino said. "No banks were open at the time for
us to verify the funds."</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen days later, officers discovered the checks were phony and
ordered a warrant for Rizzo's rearrest.</TE>
<TE>   If captured, Rizzo will be held on $2-million bail and could face
charges of forgery or conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Rizzo is a member of a prison skinhead gang with a
reputation for counterfeiting and identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo was arrested in 1999 for allegedly participating in the
stabbing of a man who police said was his friend and the godfather of
his child.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities contend the stabbing was ordered by leaders of the
prison-based gang.</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo's criminal history dates to 1988 when he was jailed on
felony drug charges.</TE>

<HD>Pit Bull Mauls Mail Carrier</HD>
<DH>Injury: Woman is seriously hurt when dog bites off part of
her nose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mail carrier was seriously injured Monday afternoon when a pit bull
mauled her, biting off part of her nose in Los Angeles, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second high-profile pit bull attack in a week. On
Saturday, a pit bull attacked 2-year-old John Michael Macias-Drisner
and his grandmother in La Habra, seriously injuring his face and
scalp.</LD>
<LD>   Letter carrier Phyllis Sanders was attacked by two dogs--a pit
bull and a shepherd mix--in the 1600 block of Holt Avenue, which is
between Robertson and La Cienega boulevards south of Pico Boulevard,
while on her route, Postal Service spokesman Larry Dozier said.</LD>
<TE>   Sanders has been delivering mail for 12 years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs came from a home next to the one where Sanders was
attacked. Mail delivery to the home had been stopped because the dogs
were considered too dangerous, Dozier said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Sanders was at home but will be monitored daily by a
doctor. She will need reconstructive surgery.</TE>
<TE>   She is the 58th mail carrier bitten this year in Los Angeles,
Dozier said, and Monday's attack was one of the most serious.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs that attacked Sanders and the pit bull that attacked John
will be destroyed. The owners agreed to have them euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Mail carriers, meter readers and other home service workers rank
second among victims of the 70,000 dog bites that occur each year in
Los Angeles. Children younger than 12 account for three-fourths of
all victims, said animal services spokeswoman Jackie David.</TE>
<TE>   Dozier said most bites of mail carriers occur during the summer.
Dog owners could prevent the injuries by restraining their pets when
carriers are in the neighborhood, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the very thing that we are trying to prevent," Dozier
said.</TE>
<TE>   David said the dogs' owner told animal control workers that the
animals got loose when a gate was accidentally left open.</TE>
<TE>   She said pit bulls and other medium-size dogs can bite with 200
pounds of pressure per square inch--enough to puncture sheet metal.</TE>

<LD>One of three Circuit City robbery suspects stole a Sheriff's
Department patrol car Tuesday and led authorities on a chase that
ended with at least five crashed vehicles and three injured
motorists, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after 2:15 p.m., deputies responded to a robbery at the
Circuit City on Gale Avenue in the City of Industry and arrested
three people, Sgt. Rick Myers said.</LD>
<LD>   But one of them managed to "gain control of a black-and-white
radio car and fled the scene," the sergeant said.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies spotted the car in South El Monte and chased it until the
fleeing driver lost control, hitting two cars, Myers said. Another
patrol car in the chase collided with a car that struck a home.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the drivers inadvertently struck were injured, at least one
seriously. The suspect had minor injuries.</TE>

<HD>New Arrivals Give Added Bite to JWA Security</HD>
<DH>Safety: Bomb-sniffing dogs and their handlers will patrol
the airport. While on duty, Rex and Ali can take breaks in a $400,000
kennel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Wayne Airport's latest security measures arrived Tuesday amid
much fanfare. Their names are Rex and Ali.</LD>
<LD>   Airport officials, along with the Orange County Sheriff's
Department and the Transportation Security Administration, introduced
the two bomb-sniffing dogs, the first time dogs and their handlers
will be assigned permanently to John Wayne.</LD>
<LD>   "The teams add another security option," airport Director Alan
Murphy said. "It's another step in our continuing effort to provide
safety and security for our patrons."</LD>
<TE>   Rex is a 2 1/2-year-old Belgian Malinois handled by Sheriff's
Deputy Kevin Nadeau; 2-year-old Ali, a Czech Shepherd, is handled by
Deputy Dave Ray. Both dogs wagged their tails as their handlers
pinned their police badges on their harnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The new security teams will make regular patrols and checks of the
airport throughout the day. A third dog-and-handler team is expected
to arrive by the end of the year, airport officials said. A grant of
$120,000 from the Transportation Security Administration pays for the
three dogs' care, airport officials said. The federal agency also
reimburses the Sheriff's Department for part of the deputies'
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Before John Wayne was assigned its bomb-detecting dogs, any
suspicious packages had to be investigated by the Sheriff's
Department's Hazardous Devices Squad. But that meant a delay because
the squad was not on-site.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, however, are essentially a "mobile detection device" and
can be sent quickly to investigate any potential threat, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Rex and Ali and their handlers went through an intensive 10-week
training program at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, which
cemented a strong bond between the partners.</TE>
<TE>   The handlers also are required to take the dogs home every night,
and it's expected that after their 10 to 12 years of service, the
dogs will retire to a shady spot in their handlers' backyards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've owned dogs all of my life," Nadeau said as he patted Rex's
back. "I like him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Rex and Nadeau finished at the head of their class and were named
"top dog and best handler." Ray and Ali finished second.</TE>
<TE>   While on duty, the dogs will be able to take their breaks in a
specially equipped $400,000 kennel, which was paid for, in part, by
airport funds. The facility, which is large enough to house six dogs,
is connected to the airport's sewer system for drainage, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of Rex and Ali also marked the 30th anniversary of the
TSA Explosives Canine Team Program. The security agency plans to have
265 bomb-detecting teams in 64 airports nationwide by the end of the
year, but the agency plans to increase that number to 325 by the end
of 2003, said Skip Williams, John Wayne Airport federal security
director.</TE>
<TE>   "We will definitely benefit from these exceptional tools," Murphy
said. "The dogs are here to instill a sense of safety to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Airport security got another boost Tuesday when the county Board
of Supervisors voted to spend $15 million to install a dozen
bomb-detection machines in the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   With the vote, county officials expressed confidence that they
will be able to meet a federal year-end deadline to strengthen
airport security measures.</TE>
<TE>   The approval by supervisors comes as airports across the nation
are questioning whether they will make the deadline set last year to
screen all checked and carry-on baggage for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The detection equipment should cause passenger delays of no more
than 15 minutes as bags are checked, John Wayne officials said.
Without the equipment, passengers would have to wait up to 10 hours
to board flights while their bags were searched by hand--as would be
required under the federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   The county will seek a federal reimbursement for the money it is

<HD>Defense Wraps Up in Simi Beating Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge, saying the attempted-murder trial has gone
too long, sets a two-hour time limit on closing arguments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys for a Simi Valley woman accused of attempting to
kill her husband to collect his insurance money wrapped up their case
Tuesday with testimony from an expert on battered-wife syndrome.</LD>
<LD>   Also, for the second consecutive day, Ventura County Superior
Court Judge Herbert Curtis III warned attorneys that the case was
dragging on too long.</LD>
<LD>   To allow the jury to begin deliberations today, each attorney will
be limited to two hours to present his or her closing arguments, the
jurist said.</LD>
<TE>   Eileen Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer, 19, are accused of
setting fire to Larry Childs' bed on March 25 and then beating him
with a baseball bat when he ran from the room.</TE>
<TE>   Both women are charged with attempted murder and arson.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution contends that the women planned to kill Larry
Childs to collect $1.4 million in life insurance. The money,
prosecutors said, could then be used to open a Jiffy Lube franchise
and boost Jennifer Childs' career as a pop singer.</TE>
<TE>   But the defense maintains that Larry Childs has a history of
physically abusing his family, and that Eileen and Jennifer Childs
were acting in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs has denied that any abuse occurred.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, defense attorneys called Glenn Lipson, who testified
about abusive relationships and domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Lipson also testified that Eileen Childs may have suffered "memory
fragmentation" after experiencing the trauma of the fire and
allegedly being attacked by her husband as he fled from the room
where the fire started.</TE>
<TE>   People with memory fragmentation may forget specific details of a
traumatic incident and instead only recall their feelings and
emotions at the time, Lipson said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys also questioned Simi Valley Police Det. Jay
Carrott in an effort to show that Larry Childs was too quickly
dismissed as a suspect in the arson.</TE>
<TE>   Several tense moments occurred during Tuesday's session. At one
point later in the afternoon, Curtis admonished the attorneys for
causing the case to run more than a week.</TE>
<TE>   Over the protests of Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee, Curtis
ordered both sides to keep their closing arguments to two hours each.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this case has dragged on for far too long," Curtis said.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Building Project Disturbs Ancient Chumash Burial Site</HD>
<DH>Archeology: After a tribal ceremony, the ground containing
tools, bowls and charred bones is returned to the state in which it
was found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction workers have stumbled across one of the largest and
oldest Chumash burial sites in the Ojai area, dating as far back as
10,000 years, archeologists and tribal members said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "In my experience, this is the biggest collection of artifacts
found in Ojai," said Pat Tumamait, a Chumash consultant who monitors
construction projects to ensure that Native American relics are not
destroyed or desecrated.</LD>
<LD>   The site contains tools, bowls and the cremated remains of two to
five people, buried beneath pieces of grinding stones called metates.</LD>
<TE>   The bone fragments were found two weeks ago when a truck grading
land for the Los Arboles Townhomes project smacked into hard rock.
Tumamait immediately halted the construction.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some metates, and in our native culture when someone
died they'd put these metates over the burial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully sifting the dirt, Tumamait and archeologist Dan Hissong
found bits of bone under the stones. Excited but unwilling to disturb
the site further, Tumamait stopped digging. Police were told of the
site and the county coroner's office analyzed bits of bone to verify
they were human, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant find, but we have to respect the Chumash. You
can't go digging things up and taking them to museums anymore," said
Hissong, who works with Tumamait to analyze archeological finds. The
area, at the back of a dirt lot, was discreetly marked off and
Tumamait performed a ceremony for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave food offerings of acorns, fish, bread, water and fruit,"
he said. "And we burnt sage. The offering of food and gifts is
basically an apology for disturbing them and to see they have food
for their journey."</TE>
<TE>   Tumamait and Hissong determined the age of the site by the style
and shape of the metates, which they say are 7,000 to 10,000 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the land responded quickly to the discovery,
redesigning the area to accommodate the grave. The bones were found
where the dumpsters would have been located.</TE>
<TE>   Now there will be a 16-by-30-foot "green space" of native
California plants above the gravesite. No additional construction
will take place on that part of the property, said construction
superintendent Don Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it's incredible to think that these are someone's
ancestors," Smith said. "It's great that we were able to catch it in
time."</TE>
<TE>   The 23-unit luxury condominium complex will sit on three acres
near Ojai's Libbey Park. Plans for the site have outraged some
residents who fear it will bring further congestion to an artists'
haven known for its tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of years before condos and congestion, the Chumash
had already settled the valley, calling it "Auhai," meaning moon in
their language, said Tumamait. Some lived in villages dotted with
cone-shaped huts while others from the coast spent a few months at a
time here each year. They mostly ate acorns ground with stone
mortars.</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Valley's rich history as a crossroads of Chumash life was
discovered years ago just below the surface. Tools, bowls, stone
pipes and sometimes human remains are commonly discovered a few feet
underground.</TE>
<TE>   Artifacts were found when the town's police station was being
built, relics were discovered along Ventura Avenue during a
sanitation district project and burial relics were located in Soule
Park and later taken to UCLA, Tumamait said.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole valley is an archeological site," said Tumamait, who
has worked since 1991 as a construction site monitor. "This site is
pretty significant. It rates about an 8 or 9 for what I have found in
the past."</TE>
<TE>   Why the remains were cremated is a mystery. Archeologists say the
Chumash were usually buried facing west to watch the setting sun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual--most bodies are found intact," said Tumamait.</TE>
<TE>   Tumamait said the most important artifacts will be put in a
display case on the property when the project is finished. Everything
else will be taken somewhere where it won't be disturbed, and be
buried.</TE>

<HD>Military Campaign to Promote U.S. Citizenship Pays Off for
147</HD>
<DH>Service: After Sept. 11, Pentagon is providing enlisted
men and women help in ironing out problems with INS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In a flag-draped ceremony aboard the aircraft carrier Constellation,
147 sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen were sworn in as U.S.
citizens Tuesday--part of the military's new push to help enlisted
personnel gain citizenship</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great!" said Navy helicopter maintenance worker Osadhi
Gunasekera, 33, a native of Sri Lanka.</LD>
<LD>   "It's wonderful to be a fully official American, at last," said
Marine Lance Cpl. Carlton McLeod, 24, born in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Noncitizens have served in the U.S. military since before the
Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently it was up to each individual to complete the
paperwork and navigate the citizenship process laid out by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Because of overseas
deployments and unscheduled transfers, many were unable to meet the
deadlines or appear at interviews. As a result, their applications
languished.</TE>
<TE>   But now the Department of Defense has ordered that each command in
each branch of the military have a staff dedicated to working with
the INS to iron out problems. The INS has designated a central
clearinghouse for all citizenship applications from military
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Like civilian applicants, military personnel go through interviews
and background checks for criminal records, outstanding warrants,
Internal Revenue Service problems and membership in terrorist groups.
Fingerprints are checked through the FBI database, which includes
records from Interpol and other foreign agencies. The military also
does background checks when a service member is being considered for
a security clearance.</TE>
<TE>   On July 3, President Bush issued an executive directive that any
noncitizens on active military duty since the terrorist attacks on
Sept. 11 is immediately eligible to apply for citizenship--without
the usual three-year wait. Bush invoked a portion of federal law
allowing expedited processing of citizenship applications by military
personnel during times of war.</TE>
<TE>   Rear Adm. Jose L. Betancourt Jr., who became a U.S. citizen at 19,
hailed the INS changes and said that until recently "it was extremely
difficult to comply with the rules and regulations" for citizenship.
"The paperwork was phenomenal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Judith Keep, who administered the oath of
citizenship, praised the "kinder, gentler, more streamlined local INS
office." Along with citizenship, 17 applicants also had their names
changed to become more "Americanized."</TE>
<TE>   The new push and the presidential directive are particularly
important to the Navy, which has the most noncitizens of any service
and is experiencing an increase in the number of noncitizens
enlisting.</TE>
<TE>   Of 31,044 noncitizens on active duty as of June, 15,708 were in
the Navy and 6,517 in the Marine Corps. Noncitizens account for about
3% of the country's military strength.</TE>
<TE>   Military personnel who are not citizens are precluded from many
jobs requiring security clearance, a career hindrance as the military
becomes more technological. Nor can they become officers.</TE>
<TE>   Benson Calica Fangon, 34, of the Philippines, a naval aviation
bosun's mate, said he first applied for citizenship in 1997 but never
completed the process. "I moved around a lot and INS couldn't find
me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Navy assistance, Fangon and his brother, Benjamin Calica
Fangon Jr., 33, a mess specialist, took the oath together Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Dronet Alba, U.S. citizenship program manager for the Navy
Region Southwest, said the goal is to complete applications within
three to four months.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the new citizens--who came from 32
countries--were in their first tour of duty, some decided to seek
citizenship after years of service.</TE>
<TE>   Navy storekeeper Enrico Cruz Audencial, 48, a 24-year veteran, had
planned to retain his Philippine citizenship because he may retire
there. But Sept. 11 changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 made everything different," he said. "This is the right
thing to do. This is my country."</TE>

<HD>Cypress, Church Closing In on Land-Dispute Settlement</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: The proposal would let the city have the site
for a retailer and give Cottonwood a nearby property that is now part
of a golf course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cypress and Cottonwood Christian Center appear close to settling
their nationally watched feud over the city's effort to use the
church's land for a tax-revenue-generating Costco.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, the church would get a larger property nearby,
on what is now the Cypress Golf Course. The city would take over the
18 acres at the intersection of Walker Street and Katella Avenue,
where Cottonwood had planned to build a mega-church for its 4,000
members, then would sell that land to Costco or another "big box"
retailer.</LD>
<LD>   "There is great potential there," said the Rev. Mike Wilson,
project manager for Cottonwood, adding that the golf course is "a
fine site."</LD>
<TE>   Such a settlement would cut short what has become a national test
case of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a
2000 federal law that exempts churches from most local zoning
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   City officials contend that the church bought the property in 1999
despite warnings that it was in a redevelopment zone where Cypress
planned a large retail center--warnings the church said were never
made.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders nationwide have accused the city of discriminating
against Cottonwood. Land use experts from the American Planning Assn.
and elsewhere have rallied around Cypress, saying a Cottonwood
victory in court would give religious institutions carte blanche to
wreak havoc with local planning.</TE>
<TE>   This month U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ordered
Cypress to stop its condemnation proceedings pending a trial in
March. Carter's opinion chastised the city for its heavy-handedness
in moving to take the property. Carter warned the city that it may be
violating the new federal act.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling has increased pressure on the city to settle, because
Carter would be the trial judge. Tuesday afternoon, city and church
officials held settlement talks for the first time since the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-acre portion of the golf course that would become the
church's is now owned by Ed Allred, who also owns the adjacent Los
Alamitos Race Course. Allred says he would sell Cottonwood most of
the 28 acres for $17 million and donate the rest to the church for a
tax break.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot depends on whether the city can pay enough to the church
for its land to make this possible," Allred said. "They seem to be
fairly close to a meeting of the minds."</TE>
<TE>   Church and city officials said they could not disclose financial
details. Negotiations had been slow until a few months ago, mostly
because Cottonwood was unable to locate other affordable vacant
properties in north Orange County suitable for the
300,000-square-foot church it plans to build.</TE>
<TE>   After Allred purchased the golf course in the spring, he pitched
the land swap to the church and the city as a feasible alternative.
Allred would not disclose how much he paid for the 92-acre golf
course but acknowledged that he would profit in the church deal. He
would use the rest of the golf course for other development projects,
he said. The city had earlier tried to take the church property for
$14.5 million through eminent domain. Under the proposed land swap,
the city would have to pay the $17 million Allred is asking and
possibly reimburse the church for what it has spent at its existing
site on planning and design, accumulated interest and attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   City officials downplayed the higher cost of the land, saying the
$14.5 million was always a starting point from which to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the city can afford the new price may depend on what
Costco is willing to pay for the land the church would be leaving.</TE>

<HD>Arleta Man Lost in Forest Is Found After 11 Days</HD>
<DH>Rescue: Luis Cruz ate leaves and drank urine to survive,
after fracturing his back in a fall.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Arleta man found Tuesday after being lost for 11 days in the
Angeles National Forest said he ate leaves and drank muddy water and
urine to survive after falling down a cliff into a wooded canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Hikers found Luis Cruz, 26, about 4 p.m. Tuesday, roughly seven
miles from the campground where he had abandoned his disabled vehicle
Aug. 9, intending to walk home.</LD>
<LD>   He was flown to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena for
treatment of a fractured back and bruises, but was otherwise fine.</LD>
<TE>   "He looked pretty good for being out there for 10 or 11 days,"
said Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic Mark Camp. "He was
basically very cool, very calm, collected.... What he was saying made
sense.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cruz appeared to be suffering from exposure and his shoulder was
bruised in a way that suggested he had dislocated it and then popped
it back in himself, Camp said. He also had pain in his right hip and
back from the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "He was eating grass. He drank some of his urine. He did what he
needed to do," Camp said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how he knew he had been in the mountains for 11 days,
Cruz said, "I have been counting them," according to Camp.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital Tuesday night, Cruz spoke with his parents and
sister of his ordeal in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   "He tried crawling to a road, but couldn't get very far," said his
sister Olga Cruz, 27. "Last night he saw a bear, and that terrified
him. He said God had protected him."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing only a green nylon jacket to protect him in temperatures
that dipped to 45 degrees at night, Cruz fingered his rosary beads
and prayed, he told his family.</TE>
<TE>   They last saw him Aug. 9, and reported him missing Aug. 11. The
family waited for two days, they said, because they kept believing he
would walk through the door at any time. Cruz often drove into the
forest to unwind, they said.</TE>
<TE>   His Chevy Tahoe was ticketed Aug. 10 at Switzer Campground near
Angeles Forest Highway for not having a U.S. Forest Service parking
pass. It was not until Monday that rangers again spotted the ticketed
vehicle. This time they ran a computer check of the license plate,
which connected the vehicle to a missing-person report, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue teams, search dogs and helicopters began scouring the area
about 2 p.m. Monday and continued into the night, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Sgt. Brian Schoonmaker. They resumed the search at
dawn Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz told his rescuers that the gas line on his SUV had broken and
he had tried to walk back to Arleta, Schoonmaker said.</TE>
<TE>   Surviving in the forest for 11 days without food or water was
"extraordinary," officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to find water up there, particularly if he was injured, I'd
call it very extraordinary," said Fire Department Capt. Steve Powell.
"If he hadn't had any survival experience, I'd say it's remarkable
that he's living."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz is a student at Valley College where he is studying biology.
He hopes to become a doctor, his family said. He also works part time
taking care of an elderly man, they said.</TE>

<HD>Ballot Translations Will Include Korean, Chinese</HD>
<DH>Elections: Census data trigger the addition of the language
aids.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County must provide ballot information in Chinese and Korean
for the November election, the result of a surge in minority
populations documented by the 2000 Census.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County already provides voting information in Spanish and
Vietnamese. Adding the new languages will cost about $500,000 for
each election, Registrar Rosalyn Lever said.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, voter information in Los Angeles County is provided
in Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and the Tagalog
language of the Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   Federal rules require that written and oral assistance be provided
for voters when minority populations reach a certain size. In
addition to written Chinese and Korean, Orange County must provide
help in three Chinese dialects, Lever said.</TE>
<TE>   Written materials will be available for those voters who state on
their registration affidavits that they were born in China or Korea.
Members of the Chinese and Korean communities will help the county
identify any other voters who are in need of special information.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is in the process of choosing a new electronic
voting system for the 2004 elections. Proposals are due Aug. 30, with
the systems of the top three bidders to be presented during a series
of open houses this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Electronic voting will be very easy because all of the vendors
have room for lots of languages," Lever said.</TE>
<TE>   Materials in the new languages will be translated by vendors into
ideographic characters. Vietnam uses a Western-based alphabet.</TE>

<HD>Meredith K. Gardner, 89; Cracked Codes to Unmask Key Soviet
Spies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BART BARNES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meredith Knox Gardner, an Army Signal Intelligence Service code
breaker whose work on encrypted KGB messages to and from Moscow
during and after World War II led to the exposure of Soviet agents
who spied on the U.S. atomic bomb project, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner died of complications from Alzheimer's disease Aug. 9 at a
care facility in Chevy Chase, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner's work included the discovery of lists of code names in
telegrams sent by the Soviet consulate in New York to Moscow from
1943 to 1945. It led directly to the unmaskings of Klaus Fuchs, the
German-born scientist convicted of spying for the Soviets; Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, who in 1953 were executed for espionage; and the
British intelligence officer Kim Philby, who after defecting to
Moscow in 1963 said he had been a Soviet spy for two decades.</LD>
<TE>   Within the intelligence community, Gardner was said to have been a
living legend, and his work in penetrating Soviet codes is widely
considered to have been one of the great U.S. counterintelligence
coups of the last half-century. But he remained unknown to the public
for more than 50 years until 1996, when he emerged from anonymity to
tell his story at a conference on the decrypting operation,
code-named "Venona." At that conference, then-Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) introduced Gardner as an unsung hero of the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   Describing his discovery of code names in the Soviet cables sent
from New York to Moscow during and after the war, Gardner told the
Venona conference: "That smelled of espionage. Otherwise, why would
you go to the trouble of using something other than someone's real
name?"</TE>
<TE>   In December 1946, his suspicions were all but confirmed when he
decrypted a New York-to-Moscow cable sent two years earlier
containing the code names of several leading scientists who had been
working on the Manhattan Project, which was the U.S. effort to build
an atomic bomb. This had been the most secret of all U.S. projects
during the war, and in the postwar period the atomic bomb was the key
to the balance of world power. Not until 1949 would the Soviets
detonate an atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, a gifted linguist who was fluent in German, Old High
German, Middle High German, Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Lithuanian,
Spanish, French, Italian, Russian and Japanese, came to Washington
early in World War II to work as a civilian for the Army Signal
Intelligence Service, a predecessor of the National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Okolona, Miss., he graduated from the University of
Texas and received a master's degree in languages from the University
of Wisconsin. Before World War II, he was a language teacher at the
universities of Akron, Texas and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   At the Army Signal Intelligence Service, Gardner was known as a
quiet and scholarly man whose reticence belied his linguistic genius.
He spent his early years with the agency working on telegraphic
messages involving Germany and Japan, especially communications
between Japanese military attaches in Berlin and other enemy capitals
and the Japanese general staff in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Gardner was reassigned to examine telegraphic
traffic involving the Soviet Union, the wartime ally of the United
States and Britain. With the end of hostilities against Germany and
Japan, Soviet matters were a top priority, and by 1946 as many as 600
people were assigned to decryption efforts on more than 35,000 pages
of coded Soviet cables.</TE>
<TE>   As senior linguist, it was Gardner's job to re-create a Russian
code book and translate Russian messages into English. In a 1996
interview, he said he attributed his success to logic, his linguistic
skills and "a sort of magpie attitude to facts, the habit of storing
things away that did not seem to have any connection at all."</TE>
<TE>   A few months after decoding the message containing the names of
scientists working on the atomic bomb, Gardner came upon a reference
to an agent with the code name "Liberal" who had a 29-year-old wife
named Ethel. These were Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Over subsequent months, as more Venona cables were decrypted, it
became clear that Moscow had recruited dozens of agents at various
levels of government, and the FBI was directed to follow up leads.
Robert Lamphere was the FBI agent named liaison officer with Venona.
He and Gardner developed a symbiotic relationship in which Gardner
gave Lamphere lists of agents named in the Venona cables, while
Lamphere gave Gardner information that might be helpful in further
decryption.</TE>
<TE>   This led to a massive manhunt for spies in the late 1940s and
early 1950s and is said to have contributed to the communist-baiting
excesses of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Among the other Soviet agents
mentioned in the Venona documents were David Greenglass, the younger
brother of Ethel Rosenberg who received a 15-year prison sentence for
passing along information about the atomic bomb; and Theodore Alvin
Hall, who was recruited as a 19-year-old Harvard student to work on
the bomb and was then said to have passed along the vital secrets of
this work to the Soviets. Hall, who was never formally charged, died
in Cambridge, England, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Information from the Venona operation also led to the exposure of
Kim Philby's British comrades in espionage, Guy Burgess, Donald
Maclean and Anthony Blunt.</TE>
<TE>   From at least two sources, the Soviets learned that their U.S.
espionage net had been discovered. One was Philby, the British
intelligence officer and double agent. He was posted in Washington in
1949 and had a habit of dropping in on Gardner's Venona operation.</TE>
<TE>   The other was Bill Weisband, a Russian emigre who was hired as a
linguistic adviser for Venona. Gardner occasionally consulted him on
points of Russian grammar. At the Venona conference, the National
Security Agency declassified tapes of the confession of a Los Angeles
aircraft worker who identified Weisband as his KGB handler. Weisband
was fired from Venona and later served a one-year prison sentence for
contempt of court for refusing to testify about Communist
connections. He died in 1967. U.S. counterintelligence officials said
they are convinced he was a Soviet spy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Gardner retired from NSA. The Venona operation was shut
down in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, Gardner lived quietly in a modest condominium on
Connecticut Avenue in Washington, where he traced his Scottish
genealogy and did the daily crossword puzzle in the Times of London,
which is reputed to be the most difficult in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 57 years, Blanche, of Washington;
two children; and 11 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Homeless Advocates Sue L.A. Over Downtown Plan</HD>
<DH>Skid row: Coalition says the poorest residents are ignored
and asks for details on how they will find housing and jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of community groups has filed suit against the city of
Los Angeles, arguing that a new plan to revive downtown fails to
specify how the city will assist downtown's neediest
residents--thousands of people living in residential hotels, in
shelters, or sleeping on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Los Angeles Coalition to End
Hunger and Homelessness, asks the court to order the city to amend
the plan--or to find it invalid.</LD>
<LD>   The goal of redevelopment is to revitalize blighted areas. The
lawsuit essentially asks whether redevelopment law--and the city's
use of it--are strong or thorough enough to address the extreme
poverty of skid row.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of the lawsuit, advocates say, is to force the city to
detail how its City Center Redevelopment Plan will provide housing or
jobs for people displaced by redevelopment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're afraid that without doing that, [the redevelopment plan] is
actually going to exacerbate blight rather than alleviate it," said
Barbara Schultz of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which
represents the coalition. "What's going to happen to those thousands
of people? If they're not getting relocation [assistance] and there's
no replacement housing? They're going to be out on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Community Redevelopment Agency declined to
comment on the lawsuit, but said the plan's primary goals include the
creation of housing and the reduction of homelessness. The specifics
of the plan will evolve over time, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a 30-year plan horizon," said Don Spivack, a CRA
spokesman. "It's virtually impossible at the outset to anticipate
every activity you're going to take."</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Los Angeles City Council approved a plan to redevelop
an 879-acre area in the eastern and southern quadrants of downtown
Los Angeles. CRA officials say the area will generate up to $2.4
billion in revenues over 45 years and create up to 6.7 million square
feet of commercial and industrial development.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment law requires that 20% of funds generated by the area
be set aside for housing. Under the city's plan, 25% of all housing
units will be for low-income residents. The plan is expected to
create 12,900 units of housing, including 3,225 that will be
designated for very low and low-income households, Spivack said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, about 3,000 to 4,000 homeless people
sleep on the streets of skid row each night.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment law calls for helping displaced residents relocate.
But one key question in the lawsuit: Who among skid row's residents
would qualify for relocation assistance?</TE>
<TE>   This question will be determined on a case-by-case basis, said
lawyers representing the city.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person is living on the street, I doubt that they would
qualify, because we wouldn't be displacing them from a residence,"
said Murray Kane, an attorney with Kane Ballmer &amp; Berkman. "On the
other hand, the agency spends a huge amount of money on homeless
assistance programs."</TE>
<TE>   For those who are living in some form of housing, assistance will
depend on the length of stay in a particular dwelling, Kane said.
Those who have lived in a place for 30 days will receive moving
expenses. Those who have lived in the same place for 90 days will
receive rental assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "If they move out every several days, they might not be eligible
for anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But on skid row, residents are often forced to move about
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a tenancy is created when a resident has been in
place 30 days. As a result, some residential hotel owners require
residents to move out for a night or switch rooms once every 28 days,
then re-rent a room, a practice that has been dubbed "the 28-day
shuffle."</TE>
<TE>   The practice is a method of circumventing tenant protections
offered under state law and the city's Rent Stabilization Ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   That ordinance, which covers buildings constructed before 1978,
keeps rents low and protects tenants from certain types of evictions.
It only applies, however, when a tenant has been in place at least 60
days.</TE>
<TE>   Some hotel residents, such as Jerome Wiggins and his girlfriend,
Joy Pearson, worry that the long-standing practice will now cause
some residents to be denied relocation assistance. They may have no
place else to turn for help. "From skid row, where do you go?" asked
Wiggins, who along with Pearson is a plaintiff in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit asks that the city be ordered to amend the plan to
provide that residents, including those prevented from establishing
tenancies, will be eligible for benefits. While the redevelopment
plan sets aside some housing for low-income and very low-income
residents, the new housing may be out of reach for the area's poorest
residents, advocates argue.</TE>
<TE>   Under redevelopment law, the city must replace housing units with
units that fall in the same income category. But advocates say that
even housing designated as "low income" might be beyond the means of
someone who could barely afford a skid row hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Low-income households are those with an income of 50% or less of
the county's median household income of about $42,000. Extremely low
income is 30%.</TE>
<TE>   The income range of many in the area, the lawsuit says, is 7% to
12% of median income. Advocates say the city's redevelopment plan
should state that replacement housing will be available to those
residing in the project area, including those whose incomes fall
below the affordable housing economic guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA has drawn fire from community groups who said that the
plan moved so quickly that they were not informed of its specifics or
offered an opportunity to have input, a claim that is repeated in the
lawsuit. "All of us are usually complaining that government moves too
slow," said Gene Boutilier, spokesman for the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "On this occasion we're saying, 'All of a sudden they got wind in
their sails and went too fast.' " The coalition, which has 200 member
organizations, participated in hearings and meetings on the plan, but
some organizations and individuals were not informed, Boutilier said.</TE>
<TE>   Spivack said the agency went beyond what the law requires in
notifying the public. Notices were published and sent to residents,
including residential hotel occupants.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the second major suit filed against the city over
the redevelopment plan. The county of Los Angeles has also sued the
CRA. Boutilier was quick to distance his coalition from others who
oppose the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not opposed to the CRA or downtown progress," he said.</TE>

<HD>LAX Solicitors May Be Limited to Booth Areas</HD>
<DH>Airport: Attempt to rein in fund-raisers must be approved
by City Council. Charitable groups would have to get monthly permits
designating locations.</DH>

<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Solicitors who approach passengers at Los Angeles International
Airport to ask for money would be restricted to booths in the
facility's nine terminals under an ordinance approved Tuesday by the
city's Airport Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The law, which must receive the City Council's blessing before it
can go into effect, is patterned after a decades-old policy at Bay
Area airports. It's also the latest attempt in a 28-year struggle by
the city to rein in fund-raisers at the world's fifth-busiest
airport.</LD>
<LD>   That debate has long pitted city officials against civil
libertarians, with the city pushing for restrictions on solicitors,
even as their advocates have repeatedly succeeded in thwarting the
city's efforts by challenging them in court.</LD>
<TE>   The ordinance would require charitable organizations to obtain a
monthly permit from the airport designating booth locations and the
days and times they can ask for donations. Permits would be issued on
a first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitors would be allowed to approach passengers with printed
material but could not ask for money unless they were sitting in the
booth. LAX officials could revoke a group's permit if it violated
detailed rules of conduct set out in the ordinance. Currently,
organizations must obtain an information card from the city each year
if they plan to solicit on city property.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials argue that the proposed law is necessary because
solicitors at LAX contribute to crowding by stopping passengers to
ask for money and distracting travelers from important security
information.</TE>
<TE>   The commission postponed discussing the ordinance in May, and
asked the city attorney's office to hire a private litigator to
review the document.</TE>
<TE>   After this review, several minor changes were made, including one
that gives the airport's general manager the discretion to allow more
than one group to use a booth at any given time.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance is the latest in a series of anti-soliciting
regulations and laws enacted by the city since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these met challenges, each of which the city lost,
including one case before the California Supreme Court and another
before the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The city considers the new law a temporary means to restrict
solicitation while it awaits a ruling in an appeal. Last summer, a
federal judge declared unconstitutional a 1997 city ordinance banning
fund-raising in airport terminals, on sidewalks and in parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a stopgap measure. We hope to be successful on the ban,"
said Ray Ilgunas, an assistant city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Ilgunas added that he is confident the new law would withstand
legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "The law permits us to restrict the manner in which 1st Amendment
activities take place in the terminals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil liberties lawyers disagreed, saying that the proposed law is
too restrictive and would not stand up in court.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot put you somewhere or impede your ability to reach
your intended audience," said David Liberman, an attorney for the
International Society of the Krishna Consciousness of California,
which sued in federal court and obtained a restraining order that
barred Los Angeles from enforcing the 1997 ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "This means they're going to have to put booths all over the
airport immediately adjacent to the pedestrian flow of traffic. I
don't think it's logistically possible for them to meet that
standard."</TE>
<TE>   The city agency that operates the airport has not yet decided
where the booths would be located.</TE>

<HD>Missing Riverside Girl Found Safe in Nevada</HD>
<DH>Crime: A former baby-sitter is arrested after his truck is
spotted by tribal police. The 10-year-old is 'in excellent
condition.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former baby-sitter was arrested and the 10-year-old girl he is
suspected of abducting hours earlier in Riverside was recovered in
good condition Tuesday when a tribal police officer stopped the man's
pickup on a reservation in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   "She was extremely glad to see me," said Ray East, the Walker
River Indian Reservation policeman who stopped the pickup. "She's in
excellent condition."</LD>
<LD>   East said the suspected abductor, 68-year-old Glenn Park, a friend
of the girl's family and her occasional baby-sitter, surrendered
peacefully.</LD>
<TE>   The police officer said the suspect was being taken to the Mineral
County jail in Hawthorne, Nev., where authorities plan to hold Park
pending the filing of any charges.</TE>
<TE>   East said Nichole Taylor Timmons was dressed in a blue Powerpuff
Girls T-shirt, blue shorts and flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Riverside police were making plans to fly Sharon
Timmons to Reno for a reunion with her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Nichole disappeared from the family home in Riverside sometime
between midnight Monday, when her mother looked in on the girl as she
slept, and 7 a.m. Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives found that a chain used to fasten a backyard gate had
been cut, according to Riverside Police Lt. John Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said information he could not reveal led detectives to
suspect immediately that the girl had been abducted.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives were tight-lipped, but neighbors said Park, who had
worked as a gardener and baby-sitter for Timmons, liked to keep the
girl by his side, often with his arm around her, when she visited him
at the nearby apartment house where he lived.</TE>
<TE>   Nichole's classmates said Park often brought treats such as
cupcakes and candy to be shared in her classroom at Alcott Elementary
School.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, police said, Timmons fired Park, effectively
ending his contact with the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe he was possibly distraught with the ending of the
relationship," said Riverside Police Chief Russ Leach.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of the investigation, police said they wanted
to question the girl's father, Ralph Timmons, 41, who divorced
Nichole's mother several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they soon cleared the father of any involvement in
the girl's disappearance, and their attention focused on Park.</TE>
<TE>   An "Amber alert" on the suspected abduction was broadcast
throughout the Southwest, describing 4-foot-6, 100-pound Nichole;
6-foot-2, 200-pound Park; and Park's blue-and-white 1982 Dodge
pickup.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, there were reports that the truck had been
seen heading north through Central California, Riverside Police
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   East said he was patrolling the 20-mile stretch of U.S. 95 that
passes through the reservation north of Hawthorne when he heard the
alert.</TE>
<TE>   "I was headed south at about 2:45 p.m. when I saw the vehicle,
heading north," East said.</TE>
<TE>   East said he quickly made a U-turn and overtook the truck. He then
pulled Park over , who was compliant, East said.</TE>
<TE>   As officials in Hawthorne booked Park, residents of the Riverside
neighborhood where the abduction occurred talked about what had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Jeri Poling, one of Park's neighbors at the apartment complex
where he lives alone, described Park's relationship with the girl as
"a little odd."</TE>
<TE>   "She was always right up against him," Poling said. "You start to
think, 'Why didn't I say something about that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Six-year-old James Higgins held his father's hand Tuesday as he
watched police and members of the news media swarming the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping they'd find her tomorrow," James told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "But they found her today, and that's such a good thing."</TE>

<HD>University of Oregon Uses Its Own Kind of Decoy to Enter
Enemy Territory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you read where the University of Oregon has erected a 12-story
mural ballyhooing its football team on the side of L.A.'s Hotel
Figueroa, just a couple of miles north of USC? In warfare, such an
enemy incursion would be called a "Trojan horse." But considering
Oregon's mascot, I guess it would be more accurate to term it a
"Trojan duck."</LD>
<LD>   Let's see Tiger Woods handle this: Just the other day I mentioned
a sighting on the San Diego Freeway of a camper with a basketball
hoop attached to the back. I didn't get a shot of anyone playing
3-on-3 during a jam-up.</LD>
<LD>   But, by coincidence, I did receive a shot of James Helms of
Arcadia practicing another sport on the Pomona Freeway (see photo).
It was more than the usual SigAlert: A toxic spill had stopped
traffic. Helms was not wild about the putting green--or, pardon me,
the putting gray.</LD>
<TE>   "The grooves that cut into the pavement don't help at all," he
said, and that's better than most golfing alibis I've heard.</TE>
<TE>   Golf postscript: The photo of Helms wasn't a gag. He actually was
practicing his putting stroke, he said, when another driver walked
over and took the shot "for her son to use in a project at school."
An urban transportation class, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Alan Simon of Van Nuys found a restaurant that
really dresses its chicken (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of dressing: Kathryn Blackmun of Highland Park said she's
not sure about the meaning of a bicycle shop sign she saw in Tampa
(see photo). And I must confess I'm not sure whether the shop was
trying to corner a very small niche market or was using bicycle
jargon I'm not familiar with. Just like I can't figure those tight
spandex uniforms pedalers wear.</TE>
<TE>   For whom the dinner bell sounds: Congrats to Orange County editor
and writer Kathryn Bold, who won this year's Imitation Hemingway
competition sponsored by Harry's Bar. In one moving section of Bold's
entry, "The Old Man and the Flea," Bold wrote of her drooling
protagonist: "It was at times like this that he feared life had no
meaning. What was life anyway, but lying around on one's blankie,
waiting for the next bowl of kibble. Life was nothing. Nada.  Nada y
nada y pues nada. Woof nada. Then she came along and gave him a treat
and for a brief time life was good. Then he puked the treat on the
rug and life was bad again."</TE>
<TE>   I was nearly moved to tears. Or to itch. I can't remember which.</TE>
<TE>   More honors: Tom O'Leary of Covina, meanwhile, achieved a
"dishonorable mention" in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest staged by
San Jose State University. This is a compliment, by the way, since
that competition invites entrants to compose the opening sentence to
the worst possible novel.</TE>
<TE>   The contest namesake wrote the line "It was a dark and stormy
night," later to be immortalized by Charles M. Schulz's dog of an
author, Snoopy.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, O'Leary wrote: "As she lay in the embrace of her lover's
arms following their ardent lovemaking, Sharon quietly hoped the
moment could last forever, well, not really forever, since she had a
pedicure in two hours, followed by lunch with her former college
roommates, but at least for a long while or so."</TE>

<LD>Responding to complaints that urban areas don't have enough
recreational areas, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted
Tuesday to spend most of the $16 million the county is receiving from
a state bond measure in northern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted 3 to 2 to divide the money evenly among the five
supervisorial districts, meaning that most of the windfall will be
spent north of the Costa Mesa Freeway. Supervisors rejected an
alternative that would have spent much of the money on southern
Orange County parks.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the county's regional and wilderness park acreage is in
southern O.C., and some residents complained Tuesday that supervisors
need to look into expanding parks elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   The $16 million in park funds was made available as a one-time
grant through Proposition 12, a state park bond act approved by
voters in March 2000.</TE>

<LD>   If only the Navy would take him.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of getting ready for basic training this summer, Brian
sits in his comfortable Anaheim home and hopes the Navy brass will
overlook the two small scars on his abdomen that have thwarted his
plans.</LD>
<TE>   The scars have been there since infancy, the result of surgeries
from an abdominal blockage when he was 3 months old.</TE>
<TE>   Each is between 2 and 3 inches long. The second scar is from
surgery to improve on the first, not to correct a recurring problem.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Navy has told Brian that the scars suggest two
surgeries--which signifies heightened risk of a recurrence of the
original problem. That, the Navy says, is enough to disqualify him.</TE>
<TE>   This has Brian, who played youth sports and says he's never had
any medical problem since the original surgery, more than a little
bummed. The Navy is a ticket he wants to punch.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider myself a smart guy, but I have a really low work
ethic," he says. "I felt that is what's held me back [in life]. I
felt the Navy ... would make me grow up, make me mature, and at the
same time offer college-level courses and an opportunity to travel,
which I love. It would just give me opportunities in so many areas
and to serve my country. It was just a no-brainer for me from midway
through my senior year."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how many other 19-year-olds admit to needing
maturity, but Brian's candor alone ought to get him into the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   It's not like anything else is amiss. When he took his recruitment
test this summer, he says, his recruiter told him the average for
young men is 50 and that a really good score would be 70 or above.
Brian scored a 91.</TE>
<TE>   He knew he had to inform the Navy of his scars, which he did. "The
first time I heard it might be a killer [for getting in], I was
shocked," Brian says. "Then the recruiter said if it was a one-time
episode, we can get you in."</TE>
<TE>   Brian needed a waiver. A Navy doctor examined him and helped fill
out the necessary form and all but told Brian he had nothing to worry
about. Optimistically, Brian waited for the phone call.</TE>
<TE>   It came last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected good news," Brian says. "I was so assured it'd be
fine. The recruiter said he had bad news, and my heart sunk. He said
the doctor [ruling on the waiver] said in a letter he had interpreted
that the two scars had been two episodes [of blockage]."</TE>
<TE>   Frohreich family history makes the disappointment all the sharper.
Brian's father, Keith, and two uncles all went into the service
before going to college. Keith Frohreich wound up a Phi Beta Kappa at
USC.</TE>
<TE>   Brian started thinking about following in their footsteps during
his junior year at Villa Park High School, when military recruiters
came to campus. He says he was an "up-and-down" student but had a 2.9
grade-point average his senior year. He played basketball as a
freshman, quit the team as a sophomore and also performed in the high
school musical last semester.</TE>
<TE>   The Frohreichs are miffed over Brian's rejection but hope a letter
from Brian's pediatric surgeon will convince the Navy to change its
mind. "It's not like he's trying to become a Navy SEAL," Keith
Frohreich says dryly.</TE>
<TE>   While unable to discuss Brian's case, a spokesman said the Navy
wants recruits. "We're not in the business of rejecting people,"
Chief Petty Officer Joe Winton said.</TE>
<TE>   The Frohreichs are thinking of calling their congressman.</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't work, Brian will contemplate Plan B:</TE>
<TE>   "Take a semester off, maybe a year, then go to junior college, try
to make myself grow up and develop my own work ethic."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, isn't that what the Navy is supposed to be good at?</TE>

<LD>Louis Wellington Schalk Jr., 76, original chief test pilot for the
A-12 Blackbird spy plane built by Lockheed's storied "Skunk Works" in
1962, died Friday in a hospice in Arlington, Va. The cause of death
was complications of leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Alden, Iowa, Schalk graduated from West Point and
served with the 86th Fighter Bomber Wing in Germany. He later
completed flight instructors school and taught at Laredo Air Force
Base in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating first in his class at the Air Force Experimental
Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1954,
Schalk became an Air Force test pilot under Brig. Gen. Chuck Yeager,
flying such aircraft as the F-104 Starfighter.</LD>
<TE>   Schalk joined Lockheed in 1957 and two years later was chosen as
Kelly Johnson's chief test pilot for the secretive "Skunk Works."</TE>
<TE>   Schalk personally helped design the cockpit of the Blackbird and
then on April 26, 1962, took the plane on its first test flight out
of Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nev. After four more days of working out
problems, Schalk took the Blackbird aloft again on April 30 for its
first official flight. For many years, the Blackbird reigned as the
fastest plane in the skies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Schalk's name was added to the Aerospace Walk of Honor in
Lancaster.</TE>

<HD>Businessman Pleads Guilty in Ponzi Scheme</HD>
<DH>Fraud: He faces up to 57 months in prison for $21-million
scam that victimized more than 200 people.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles businessman has agreed to plead guilty to defrauding
more than 200 friends, relatives and associates through a $21-million
Ponzi scheme, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Gary A. Eisenberg, 64, who operated Advance Finance Inc. and
Advance Finance Holding Inc. in Beverly Hills, was charged with four
counts of securities and mail fraud.</LD>
<LD>   His victims included his in-laws and a half-brother, as well as a
large assortment of friends, acquaintances and business associates,
according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen A. Cazares.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Eisenberg accepts responsibility for the mistakes he made
that led to these charges, and he's sorry for the breach of trust he
caused with investors," said his attorney, John Cotten.</TE>
<TE>   Cotten said Eisenberg is cooperating with federal authorities in
an effort to recover some of the missing money and locate others who
may have been involved in the scam.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenberg was in the business of advancing money to manufacturers
while they awaited payments for accounts receivable, a practice known
as factoring.</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 through 2001, the government charged, he raised more
than $21 million through the sale of partnerships in his factoring
enterprise, promising investors returns of 9% to 18% a year.</TE>
<TE>   He told investors that the partnerships were risk-free because the
accounts receivable were from Fortune 500 companies such as Home
Depot, Macy's and American Express, according to his written plea
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, prosecutors said, Eisenberg loaned the money to
non-credit-worthy clients, some of whom paid kickbacks to his
employees.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1996, prosecutors said, Eisenberg knew that Advance
Finance and Advance Finance Holding were racking up huge losses.</TE>
<TE>   As a cover-up, they said, he began making interest payments with
proceeds from new investors.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Eisenberg and his businesses filed for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the plea agreement, he faces a possible sentence of
46 to 57 months in prison and will be required to make full
restitution to his victims.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action
against Eisenberg on Tuesday that mirrors the allegations in the
criminal complaint. Eisenberg has agreed to settle that lawsuit as
well.</TE>

<LD>A Chatsworth man has been sentenced to 27 months in federal prison
for failing to report more than $200,000 in business receipts.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Lee Morris, 61, a general contractor in the San Fernando
Valley, pleaded guilty in March to filing a false tax return and
admitted to underreporting his income for two years.</LD>
<LD>   Morris had faced a lesser sentence of 10 to 14 months for pleading
guilty to the charges before the trial. U.S. District Court Judge
Nora Manella, however, handed down the increased term on Monday,
finding Morris had obstructed justice by submitting forged documents
and false declarations to the court in an attempt to reduce his
sentence.</LD>

<HD>Hearing on Simon Firm's Case Delayed</HD>
<DH>Courts: The family's investment business seeks to overturn
$78-million verdict. New date is just eight weeks before election
day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY RABIN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dealing a setback to Republican Bill Simon Jr., a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge dimmed the candidate's hopes Tuesday for quick
reversal of a $78-million verdict against his family investment firm.
Instead, the judge set a hearing just eight weeks before election day
and said he may not even rule at that time.</LD>
<LD>   As Democratic Gov. Gray Davis stumped across the state, attorneys
in the civil case clashed in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom,
arguing whether William E. Simon &amp; Sons was guilty of fraud, or
whether Simon and other principals in the company were themselves
defrauded by one of their business partners.</LD>
<LD>   The GOP gubernatorial nominee was campaigning Tuesday in Tulare
and did not attend the court hearing, which lasted about 45 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   A civil jury found last month that William E. Simon &amp; Sons
defrauded Paul Edward Hindelang Jr., in a deal to take control of his
Los Angeles pay phone company, Pacific Coin. The jury said the Simon
firm hid from Hindelang, who retained an interest in the company,
that it planned to borrow huge sums of money to expand Pacific Coin
against his wishes, and then to take it public in a stock offering.
Pacific Coin collapsed under the weight of the debt burden, wiping
out Simon's investment and Hindelang's business.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud verdict dealt a major blow to Simon's campaign, because
the candidate has used his business record as one of the central
themes in his bid to unseat Davis. Simon, co-chairman of the
investment firm, is on leave from the company as he campaigns for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to resolve the political and legal issues quickly,
attorneys for Simon and the family firm asked Superior Court Judge
James C. Chalfant earlier this month to set aside the
multimillion-dollar verdict. A hearing on those motions had been set
for Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   But in court papers filed Friday, the lawyers opened another legal
front by arguing that Hindelang defrauded Simon and other investors
by not revealing his criminal record as a marijuana smuggler in the
late 1970s and early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Hindelang contend that Simon representatives never
asked whether Hindelang had been convicted of a felony before
deciding to invest in the pay phone business in February 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Chalfant canceled the Sept. 6 hearing and set another
for Sept. 10, when he will hear further arguments in the case. Even
then, he said, he may take the matter under submission--which would
push the case even closer to the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to get off the political defensive, Simon planned to
launch a new TV ad today attacking Davis' record on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The spot cites a report in the San Jose Mercury News that a board
with Davis appointees approved the release of toxic substances into
San Francisco Bay by the Tosco refinery shortly after it donated
$70,000 to the governor's reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The spot is the first that Simon has aired in weeks, as he
struggles with a chronic shortage of funds. Sal Russo, the campaign's
chief strategist, described the new ad campaign as modest. He said
that Simon's advertising reach would expand over time and that the
GOP hopeful will remain on the air from now through election day.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly anticipating the attack, Davis defended his environmental
record at a San Francisco appearance alongside some of his fellow
Democratic governors. He cited his decision to sign legislation to
limit greenhouse gas emissions, protect endangered redwoods, cut
state park fees in half and clean up California's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent likes to describe himself as an old oil and gas man;
far be it for me to quarrel with this description," Davis gibed. "He
is not in touch with California's need to have a clean environment.
He is not the person to turn the environment of California over to."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the governor appeared in Los Angeles with schools Supt.
Roy Romer, who released improved standardized test scores for the
district's elementary schools.</TE>

<HD>San Jose Plans to Open Part of Complex</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Debut will be delayed after fire gutted another
section. City vows to finish project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>City officials and developers of the fire-ravaged Santana Row
development promised Tuesday that their $500-million project,
conceived at the height of the dot-com boom, will rise as planned and
help lead Silicon Valley out of the dot-com bust.</LD>
<LD>   "Although this has had and will have a tremendous economic impact
on this project and our city, I am confident that we will move
forward and rebuild," Mayor Ron Gonzales said Tuesday. "It is very,
very important."</LD>
<LD>   City spokesman David Vossbrink said that the planned Sept. 19
opening of another part of the sprawling complex "will have to slip a
bit" but that the city is committed to helping it open as soon as
possible.</LD>
<TE>   "People want to live here, people want to be here, and we want to
get it opened as quickly as possible," said Steve Guttman, chairman
and chief executive of Federal Realty Investment Trust, the project's
Maryland-based developer.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-alarm fire gutted a six-acre section of the development--a
42-acre retail, commercial and residential project designed to become
a destination for people from all over the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   There were no immediate damage estimates Tuesday, and
investigators had not been able to determine a cause because the
damaged area was still too hot.</TE>
<TE>   The development was one of the most ambitious projects of its kind
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a boost to our psyche that we were poised for an economic
recovery," said Jim Cunneen, chief executive of the San Jose Silicon
Valley Chamber of Commerce. "I am devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of job seekers had lined up last month hoping to land one
of the about 1,000 jobs that would ultimately open at the mall. The
annual sales tax contribution to the city was expected to be "in the
millions," said Paul Krutko, San Jose's economic development
director.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze erupted Monday, spewing 100-foot-high flames.</TE>
<TE>   It was the largest fire in San Jose history, said Fire Chief
Manuel Alarcon--and perhaps the most devastating since an 1887 blaze
burned the city's Chinatown and displaced more than 2,000 people.</TE>

<HD>Union Flexes Its Muscle as Talks Stall at Harbor</HD>
<DH>Labor: Wharf and clerical workers are backed by Teamsters
and longshoremen. A strike would effectively shut down Port of
Hueneme.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their tiny work force consists of only 18 people. But should these
wharf and clerical workers at the Port of Hueneme decide to walk off
their jobs over a salary dispute, they would have some powerful
allies standing with them: the longshoremen's union and the
Teamsters.</LD>
<LD>   Such a strike would effectively shut down the only deep-water port
between Los Angeles and San Francisco, dealing a major blow to the
local economy.</LD>
<LD>   "It's $1 million a day if that port closes down," said Ellyn
Dembowski, deputy director of Service Employees International Union,
Local 998, and chief negotiator for the port employees.</LD>
<TE>   But officials for the Oxnard Harbor District, which operates the
port, said an independent mediator would be called in if necessary to
avoid any work disruptions. Angered by the local's publicity tactics,
district officials declared an impasse in the negotiations late
Monday and no new talks have been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Buenger, port executive director, questioned the
union's commitment toward meaningful bargaining after representatives
arrived at Monday's session with a news release announcing that its
members had voted to authorize a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothers me that they do that at the beginning of a meeting
where we're making progress," he said. "I think it's bad-faith
bargaining on their part."</TE>
<TE>   Buenger said tentative agreements have been reached on several
changes to the existing contract, which expired June 30. To date, the
port and the union representing its wharfingers, maintenance crew and
clerical staff have given preliminary approval to a lower-cost health
plan for current employees, and to adding Cesar Chavez's birthday as
an 11th paid holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Workers also would be allowed to accumulate more sick leave, which
they can cash out when they retire or leave the port.</TE>
<TE>   Buenger said the union pushed for additional benefits but proved
unwilling to offer sufficient concessions.</TE>
<TE>   "From our standpoint, it really made no sense to put any
additional items on the table when they weren't putting anything on
from their side," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dembowski said the 65-year-old port continues to grow and
increase profits, so it has ample money for extra wages and benefits.
"We're not talking about a poor employer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the outstanding issues are disputes about wage increases,
pensions and health benefits for future retirees. Dembowski said the
two sides are close on wages--the union seeks a 17% pay increase over
three years; the district has offered 13%.</TE>
<TE>   The union opposes the district's suggested changes to the pension
plan and its proposal to eliminate a provision requiring it to pay
full health, dental and vision benefits to any future retiree over 50
years old with as little as five years of service.</TE>
<TE>   Wages for the local's unionized workers range from $13 an hour for
a beginning clerical worker to $23.40 an hour for an experienced
wharfinger, who helps steer cargo ships to one of the port's five
berths.</TE>
<TE>   Dembowski said she intends to lead a group of SEIU and
International Longshore and Warehouse Union members to next Monday's
district board meeting to ask harbor commissioners to direct Buenger
to settle the contract. There are nearly 100 longshoremen working at
the port.</TE>
<TE>   Buenger said he supports a return to give-and-take negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel there's been a lot of progress made," he said. "And the
issues that remain--whether they are considered great or
insignificant--are still issues I think can be dealt with."</TE>

<LD>Encouraged by a state tourism campaign to "find yourself here" rather

of the year, according to the latest seasonal forecast by D.K.
Shifflet &amp; Associates, a travel research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "That's encouraging news to us," said Fred Sater, spokesman for
California Tourism, the state tourism agency. "We are on the road to
recovery in tourism."</TE>
<TE>   California was the nation's most visited state last year with an
11.6% share of the domestic travel market, compared with 6.8% for
Texas, 5.8% for Florida and 4.4% for New York, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism industry officials credited a $12-million advertising
campaign by California Tourism with encouraging Californians to take
their vacations closer to home after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million Californians owe their jobs to tourism, an
industry that accounts for about 6% of the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   And for the time being at least, in-state travel by Californians
is filling the void left by the decrease in visits from foreign and
out-of-state tourists, state and industry officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary results of a state-commissioned study, conducted
by D.K. Shifflet &amp; Associates and released Tuesday, suggest that the
increase in in-state leisure travel by Californians is linked to
California Tourism's advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   From December through early March, the agency ran print,
television and radio advertisements featuring celebrities such as
Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson. The campaign--with the slogans
"California, Find Yourself Here" and "We're Californians"--marked the
first time that California Tourism had tailored its sales pitch to
state residents.</TE>
<TE>   In November, before the campaign, resident travel in California
was down 8% and nonresident travel was down 11% compared with
November 2000, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   But from December through February, while the ads were running,
about 65 million Californians made in-state trips of 50 miles or more
away from their homes, compared with about 60 million during the same
period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, there were 8.2 million visits by
nonresidents, a decline from 10.1 million from December 2000 to
February 2001, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   The trends have been noted at some of the state's most popular
tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   At Yosemite National Park, there are noticeably fewer foreign
visitors, said park ranger Deb Schweizer.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking through Yosemite Village, the majority of people seem to
be Californians," Schweizer said.</TE>
<TE>   The total number of park visitors was 529,000 in July, down from
552,000 in the same month last year, Schweizer said.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for hotel and restaurant owners may be good news for
some Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "There are less tour buses in the park," Schweizer said. "It is a
little bit easier to get reservations in the park this year."</TE>

<LD>Donald Trump, who is in escrow to buy the bankrupt Ocean Trails golf
course in Rancho Palos Verdes, said Tuesday that he plans to build a
house for himself and improve the course but not try to commercially
develop it.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really a spectacular location," said the New York real
estate tycoon, who owns two highly regarded courses in New York and
Florida. "It is the best piece of property in the nation for a golf
course. It will more than rival Pebble Beach."</LD>
<LD>   Rancho Palos Verdes City Manager Les Evans said the site is
approved for use as a golf course and a 75-lot residential
subdivision. Trump said that he will build his own home on one of the
lots and that the remainder will be sold for homes as planned.</LD>
<TE>   The beleaguered 15-hole golf course was to have had 18 holes. But
in 1999, while the course was under construction, a piece of land
around the 18th hole plunged into the Pacific Ocean. Two other holes,
the 9th and the 12th, were closed as part of the ongoing repair.</TE>
<TE>   Trump said he first approached Ocean Trails' original owners,
brothers Ken and Bob Zuckerman, about the property several months
after the landslide. He renewed his effort to acquire the property
after the Zuckermans lost control of the course to their lenders,
Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "I contacted the bank, and we were able to make a deal," said
Trump, who would not disclose the purchase price or other details of
the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched the trauma of what happened there," he said. "It was
sad to see."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, he admires the layout of Ocean Trails and has no
concerns about its stability.</TE>
<TE>   Trump, who has played at the course, including this weekend, said
that he does "have a vision for the property" but that it is too
early to reveal details.</TE>
<TE>   That vision does not include any additional commercial development
beyond the restaurants in the clubhouse already there, he said. Such
extra development, Mayor John McTaggart said, in any case would
require changes to the city's general plan and probably would not
enjoy public support.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on the council 19 years, and folks here have only
supported people who adhere to the general plan," McTaggart said.</TE>
<TE>   Trump's prediction that the course will rival Pebble Beach drew
some skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Ocean Trails is an excellent design with stunning views and has
the potential to be the best upscale course in Southern California,
but you couldn't ever compare it to Pebble Beach in terms of design
and memorable holes," said Geoff Shackelford, author of seven golf
course architecture books and an avid golf historian. "Will people
come from around the world just to see Ocean Trails? No."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Thomas, director of communications for the Southern California
Golf Assn., said everyone "who builds an oceanfront course has the
dream of becoming the next Pebble Beach. But Ocean Trails is about 75
years behind Pebble Beach in history, and that can't be overcome.
History is a huge part of golf--it's what makes it so special. Ocean
Trails has its own history to carve out."</TE>

<HD>Razor Found in Sandwich</HD>
<DH>Safety: Grocery chain, police seek clues after girl bites
on blade in Oxnard. She is unhurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in an Albertsons grocery store parking lot in Oxnard, Cory
Mayfield and her two daughters were in a rush to eat their
mini-submarine sandwiches from the supermarket's deli.</LD>
<LD>   After a long vacation, back-to-school shopping beckoned.</LD>
<LD>   Cory's portion seemed fine. So did 11-year-old Amanda's. But
10-year-old Sarah got more than bread and lunch meat. Latched to her
teeth from her first bite was a rusty razor blade.</LD>
<TE>   Three days after the frightening discovery that left the little
girl shaken but unhurt, Oxnard police on Tuesday continued their
investigation into how the razor blade got into the sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the grocery store chain said they are conducting
their own investigation, which included a close examination of a
store security videotape. Store officials also pulled all deli items
from shelves and inspected them for tampering.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors with the Ventura County Environmental Health Division
pored over the area where the prepackaged sandwiches were made before
ruling Tuesday that no evidence of health code violations was found.</TE>
<TE>   For Cory Mayfield, a registered nurse who lives with her husband
and two daughters in Simi Valley, the incident was a reminder of how
one can never be too careful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad sign of the times that people would do this," Mayfield
said. "You should be able to buy a sandwich from your neighborhood
grocery store and not be put in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Det. Rick Anderson said he has few leads in the
case. He said it's the first such case in the city that he can
remember.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he has interviewed employees and expects to receive
a copy of the store videotape from the chain's Fullerton
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers should be checking to make sure the product that you're
purchasing is sealed from the place you buy it," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Sarah discovered the razor blade, Cory Mayfield
returned to the supermarket to notify store officials. She also
called police.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't quite sure what to do because this wasn't an
everyday occurrence," Mayfield said of Albertsons employees. "I was
just trying to get their attention and get the sandwiches pulled from
the shelves. I didn't want this to happen to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the grocery chain, which has 10 stores in Ventura
County, said the store immediately removed all items from the deli
case and conducted an inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Karen Ramos said security officials will spend the
next few days reviewing store videotapes for clues.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, county officials said managers of the Oxnard store, in
the 900 block of Ventura Road, have already implemented new security
measures to protect against similar future incidents.</TE>

<HD>Davis Ally Urges New Panel on Use of Colorado River</HD>
<DH>Politics: Critics fear Keith Brackpool is trying to
override MWD concerns about his plan to store water under the Mojave
Desert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The chief advocate of a proposal for a giant water storage project
buried under the Mojave Desert is backing an effort to create a state
panel that would oversee California's use of Colorado River water.</LD>
<LD>   The activity by Keith Brackpool, chief executive officer of Cadiz
Inc., has raised concerns from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and
other project critics who worry that Brackpool may be trying to
override objections from Southern California's Metropolitan Water
District.</LD>
<LD>   Cadiz has a tentative contract with the giant water district. But
MWD officials recently have indicated that they have reservations
about his proposal.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm really concerned how this board would be used," Feinstein
said Tuesday. "I don't know what's behind this, and I must tell you
my curiosity is piqued."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla (D-Pittsburg), one of the two chief
sponsors of the bill to establish the board, said the panel would not
have the authority to order MWD to approve the $150-million Cadiz
water storage project.</TE>
<TE>   But MWD officials said the panel's authority so far is vague.</TE>
<TE>   "Our interpretation is that it would create another checkpoint
when you approve or deny a project," MWD Vice President Adan Ortega
Jr. said. "And so it could complicate things greatly."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed board could distribute public money and speed up
water projects aimed at weaning California from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Those projects could include a proposal by Cadiz to store Colorado
River water under the company's desert property during periods of
surplus and pump the water out later for use by the MWD during
shortages.</TE>
<TE>   Brackpool, a close political ally of and fund-raiser for Gov. Gray
Davis, is supporting a proposal by Canciamilla and Sen. Jim Costa
(D-Fresno) to create a panel made up of gubernatorial appointees to
oversee efforts to reduce California's use of Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of MWD and other major water agencies in the state,
along with some leading legislators, said that a legislative panel,
not appointees of the governor, should oversee those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we need a commission when a legislative committee could do
the job?" asked Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative contract reached last year, Cadiz would earn
$500 million in fees over the next 50 years from MWD, which serves 17
million people from Ventura to San Diego. The MWD board is expected
to vote in coming months on whether to enter a partnership with
Cadiz.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 9, the water district's general manager sent Brackpool a
letter reminding him that MWD has not yet committed to a deal.</TE>
<TE>   MWD officials have raised the concern that if the federal
government follows through on its warning to cut the amount of water
California can take, there won't be enough surplus Colorado River
flow to make the Cadiz storage useful.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein and other critics of the Cadiz plan fear that the
pumping of ground water could badly damage the Mojave Desert
ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, California has used far more than the 4.4 million
acre-feet of water from the Colorado to which it is entitled under a
1934 agreement with six other states. In 1999, in what is known as
the "4.4 Plan," California agreed to shrink its use of the river over
15 years. The U.S. Department of the Interior has threatened to cut
off California's excess supplies if it doesn't show sufficient
progress under that plan by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Costa said his bill is aimed at meeting the federal deadline and
showing the other states along the river that California is serious.</TE>
<TE>   "We're left with four months on the time clock, and we have a
credibility problem with the upper and lower basin states," Costa
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cadiz, which is based in Santa
Monica, said it makes sense for the Legislature to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   "As the end of the year draws near and the federal government
keeps threatening to cut California and everyone keeps pointing
fingers," she said, "it doesn't surprise me that some people are
starting to look at oversight over the 4.4 Plan."</TE>
<TE>   She said Brackpool "hasn't talked to anyone that I know of" about
Costa's legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said Brackpool called him last week to describe the need
for oversight of California's use of the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long enjoyed Brackpool's support. He donated $50,000 to
Davis in 2000 and again in 2001. In June, he gave him $25,000.</TE>

<HD>Doris Wishman; Exploitation Film Director, Cult Favorite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her films were crass, coarse and camp, and fell into such
exploitation categories as "nudies," "roughies," "chesties" and
"slashers"--perfect fodder for a cult following.</LD>
<LD>   But nobody was more surprised at such film-festival idolatry that
developed over the last 20 years than the woman at its
center--independent filmmaker Doris Wishman. The best of her 30 films
with the bargain-basement budgets and racy titles is generally
acknowledged to be 1965's "Bad Girls Go to Hell."</LD>
<LD>   Wishman, whose final movie, "Each Time I Kill," is expected to be
released later this year, died Aug. 10 in a Miami hospital of
complications from lymphoma. Refusing to divulge her age, she was
estimated to be from 77 to 90 and had lived in Coral Gables, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Manhattan, Wishman attended Hunter College and studied
acting, hoping to become an actress. But the only role she could land
was as a secretary in a relative's film distribution business. She
married adman Jack Abrahms and moved to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   When he died of a heart attack at 31 in 1958, Wishman looked for
an all-consuming job--"something to fill my hours with," she told The
Times in 1988 when Los Angeles' Four Star Theater was preparing to
show her 1962 film "Nude on the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   When Wishman decided to direct and produce films and took a crash
course in filmmaking, she said, "I got the challenge I was looking
for."</TE>
<TE>   Operating on typical budgets of $70,000 to $100,000, Wishman
quickly found a salable niche--pseudo-documentaries of nudist camps,
the only films allowed by courts in the 1960s to depict nudity. "Nude
on the Moon," in which astronauts were greeted by naked beauties with
makeshift antenna poking from their bouffant hairstyles, was banned
in New York state, among others.</TE>
<TE>   But much of Wishman's work--eight "nudies" in all--passed legal
muster. Her personal favorites were the moon flick and "Blaze Starr
Goes Nudist," the only feature film made by the notorious Baltimore
stripper.</TE>
<TE>   Wishman not only produced and directed but wrote, cast and edited
most of her films. Her nudies were innovative because she added plots
and stories to the usual fare of nature boys and girls frolicking in
the altogether.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1960s, she had switched from simple nudies to grittier
film-noir roughies--sexploitation melodramas with lots of gratuitous
nudity and violence in which innocent girls are corrupted by the big
city and the men they meet there. Those movies featured Wishman's
quirky style that utilized bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and
squirrels and suggestive lesbian subplots. Among her roughies were
"The Sex Perils of Paulette," "Bad Girls Go to Hell," "Another Day,
Another Man" and "Love Toy."</TE>
<TE>   Wishman's third phase may have become the most popular--her more
openly pornographic (court strictures continued to ease) "chesties"
featuring Chesty Morgan, the Polish stripper with a 73-inch bust.
Morgan made two features for Wishman: "Deadly Weapons" in 1973, in
which the heroine seeks revenge for the death of her gangster
boyfriend and smothers the killers; and "Double Agent 73," in which
she is a spy with a camera implanted in one breast.</TE>
<TE>   What the director really wanted to do was make horror films--or
"slashers." Despite a lack of money and expertise, Wishman started in
that genre with "A Night to Dismember" in the 1980s. She followed
that years later with "Satan Was a Lady" and "Each Time I Kill."</TE>
<TE>   Wishman's film-credit pseudonyms were almost as colorful as her
titles--Doris Chasnik, Dee Ess, Luigi Manicottale, O.O. Miller,
Lazarus Volkyl, Doris Wisher.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really like my movies," Wishman said in an interview
earlier this year. "Some of those actors were so ugly."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt if I had the money," she told another interviewer, "I
could have done better."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, fans--particularly those who flock to art houses and
film festivals--decided that they did like her films.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' Nuart invited the director to attend its 1998
offering titled "Doris Wishman: Queen of Sexploitation." The
selective retrospective included "Bad Girls Go to Hell," "Double
Agent 73" and Wishman's graphic documentary about transsexuals, "Let
Me Die a Woman," which she made in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   A Times reviewer evaluating Wishman's films at that showing
praised her as "an instinctive, dynamic storyteller with a camera"
whose style "at times recalls [directors] Sam Fuller and Russ Meyer."
The transsexual film, the reviewer added, was "replete with graphic
surgical details and dramatized scenes in which tastelessness vies
with compassion and even tenderness."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Bob Briggs, the self-styled Drive-In Movie Critic of
Grapevine, Texas, has called Wishman "the greatest female
exploitation director in history."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bowen, a Brown University graduate student in visual
culture, is preparing a biography of Wishman titled "It's Better Than
Sex," referring to Wishman's attitude about filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Something Weird Video last year produced a "Drive-In
Double Feature" DVD containing two Wishman films, "Bad Girls Go to
Hell" and "Another Day, Another Man."</TE>
<TE>   "Her movies," Something Weird founder and owner Mike Vrany told
The Times last year, "are actually the epitome of what fascinates me
about ultra-low-budget movies--the fact that they were ever made....
Doris is a perfect example of anarchy filmmaking."</TE>
<TE>   Wishman, whose second brief marriage ended in divorce, had no
children. She is survived by a sister, Pearl Kushner, of Coral
Gables, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Florida Wants All the Details From Mothers in Adoption
Notices</HD>
<DH>Rule: Law stirs furor as women must publicly list sexual
partners before giving up their children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Can a woman be compelled by law to publish details of her sex life in
the newspaper, including the names of the men she has been intimate
with? In Florida she can, if she is offering her child for adoption.</LD>
<LD>   The law, intended to give biological fathers a greater say in the
adoption process, has stirred controversy nationwide. Opponents call
it a latter-day "scarlet letter" meant to shame promiscuous women.
Even the state senator who championed the measure admits that it has
had unintended results.</LD>
<LD>   "The law is anti-adoption, anti-family, anti-child, anti-woman,"
contended Nashville attorney Bob Tuke, president of the American
Academy of Adoption Attorneys. "There is no other law like it in
America."</LD>
<TE>   Jeffery M. Leving, a Chicago attorney and advocate for fathers'
rights, countered: "I like the law because it recognizes that fathers
are parents too. It recognizes that they should have notice before a
child is given away forever."</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, if a Florida mother seeks to give up her child for
adoption and a search has failed to turn up the father, she is
required to publish a legal notice giving her full name, height,
weight and coloring--plus the names or descriptions of every possible
father and the dates and places of their sexual encounters.</TE>
<TE>   The ads are supposed to run once a week for four weeks and must
appear in newspapers in any city or county where the child might have
been conceived.</TE>
<TE>   "This is such an intrusion of a woman's privacy and of the privacy
of the men who were involved with her," said Charlotte H. Danciu, a
Boca Raton, Fla., attorney who specializes in adoptions and has gone
to court to challenge the law. "And the men named in the newspaper
may not even be the father."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the law, which was passed overwhelmingly by the
Florida Legislature last year, is to locate as many biological
fathers as possible and prevent the bitter, drawn-out battles that
can break up adoptive families after children have been placed.</TE>
<TE>   But when told of the statute's publication clause, some pregnant
women have walked out of Danciu's office and had abortions, the
lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   On July 24, in response to a suit brought by Danciu, Palm Beach
County Circuit Judge Peter Blanc ruled that the law should not apply
to rape victims. The lawyer is representing six clients, including a
12-year-old rape victim, who want to offer their offspring for
adoption but haven't been able to locate the fathers or don't know
their identities. Danciu plans to appeal to have the law declared
unconstitutional for adults and minors alike.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the judge's ruling, if there was consensual sex, which in
the case of one of my clients involves a 14-year-old who slept with
numerous men and boys in her school, she would have to put these ads
in her hometown newspaper, with their names, plus their descriptions:
eye color, hair color, weight, height," Danciu said. "It's repulsive.
I refuse to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The law's chief sponsor was state Sen. Walter "Skip" Campbell Jr.,
a Democrat from Broward County. Even he has acknowledged that when
lawmakers in Tallahassee approved the measure, they weren't mindful
of all of the possibilities--including preteen girls becoming
mothers. In a letter to the president of the Florida Senate last
week, Campbell said that a "well-intentioned" reform had had
"significant unintended consequences."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that Senate committee staff members be convened to
find a remedy.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Campbell's staff said he is on vacation and unavailable
for further comment. The senator previously had appeared on
television to defend the law but failed to sway some of the state's
opinion makers. The Daytona Beach News-Journal, for instance,
denounced the legislation in its editorial columns as "ignominious."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics wonder whether the measure wasn't, in the final
analysis, futile. Typically, legal announcements are printed in
minute type on the back pages of newspapers. "To assume that a man
sits around reading the legal notices, well, is that what men do?"
Tuke asked. "The law is foolish and ineffective."</TE>
<TE>   Danciu said she was aware of only one advertisement so far in
accordance with the law, following the birth of a girl this year in
Altamonte Springs. The mother's name and description were given in
the notice printed in the Tallahassee Democrat, but the woman was
unable or unwilling to provide any information about the
father--including his name, age or race. The notice, addressed only
to "an unknown male," advised him his parental rights would be
terminated forever if he didn't take legal action.</TE>
<TE>   The measure became law in October without the signature of
Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who has noted numerous problems with it.
Officials in the governor's office say he supports an alternative way
of protecting fathers' rights--one already in use in many other
states. Called fathers' registries, this system permits men who
believe they may have fathered a child to place their names on a
confidential list, which must be checked during adoption proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be making adoption easier, not more difficult, and not
stigmatizing women who are trying to do the right thing," Bush
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hirst told reporters in Tallahassee.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tuke, who helped draft the 1996 revision of
Tennessee's adoption code, at least 30 states maintain fathers'
registries. "They work and are constitutional and confidential and
give the birth father the power to do something affirmative. He
doesn't have to sit by passively and expect that someone is going to
publish something."</TE>
<TE>   Leving, the Chicago attorney who founded the Fatherhood
Educational Institute, said the registries are no miracle solution.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one in Illinois, but it's ineffective. You have to
register as the father within 30 days of the birth or you can lose
all rights to your child. But there's no requirement that you be
informed of the birth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's adoption law was born of the painful controversy over
one child, known as Baby Emily, which is still very much on
legislators' minds.</TE>
<TE>   The girl became the object of a three-year custody battle after
her father, a convicted rapist, opposed her adoption. The dispute was
settled in 1995 after the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of the
adoptive parents while instructing lawmakers to set a deadline for
challenging adoptions. The 106-page law approved in 2001 prohibits
anyone from contesting an adoption after two years.</TE>
<TE>   Danciu, who went to Tallahassee to lobby against some of the law's
provisions, recalls a distinct misogynistic tinge to some
legislators' pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the comment made, 'If she is sleeping around, what kind
of reputation does she have to protect anyway?' It didn't click that
it was going to affect men too," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it will be embarrassing to some women, but people need
to take responsibility for their actions," Leving said of Florida's
law. "If women and men engage in indiscriminate recreational sexual
activity, they have to accept the responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Bear Attack in N.Y. Puzzles Experts</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Animal that killed baby did not have rabies.
Officials try to calm fears over tragedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>With rabies ruled out, wildlife experts said Tuesday that they didn't
know why a black bear dragged away and killed a 5-month-old girl in
the Catskills, but they urged people not to fear a repeat of the rare
tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Black bears, normally timid creatures, have killed only 50 people
in North America in the last century, and Esther Schwimmer was only
the second to die in eastern U.S. forests.</LD>
<LD>   In most cases, "bears are just big chickens," said Lynn Rogers,
director of the Wildlife Research Institute and the North American
Bear Center in Ely, Minn. "They've survived by running without
question. The littlest hound can chase the biggest bear up a tree."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, however, a 155-pound male bear wandered into the resort
town of Fallsburg, knocked Esther out of her stroller and carried her
into nearby woods. The 3-year-old bear dropped the infant after
people threw rocks at it, but the baby died shortly afterward of
severe head and neck injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Police shot and killed the bear, then had it tested for rabies.
But the tests came back negative, said Ward Stone, wildlife
pathologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
He said he would continue to test for other illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said the bear might have thought the baby was food.</TE>
<TE>   "Babies smell different. They have powders on them, milk on their
clothes that may have been spilled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Esther's parents, Shmaya and Rachel Schwimmer, buried their baby
Monday night after the attack.</TE>

<HD>Putting a Price on Sept. 11's Human Loss</HD>
<DH>Terror: For a grieving husband and several others, an
arduous process is about to end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN and GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael James kissed his wife goodbye on Sept. 11 as she left for her
two-hour train ride to New York City. Hours later, this loving
husband became a grieving husband. Now, as the financial dust of
America's most deadly terrorist attack begins to settle, the
48-year-old New Jersey gym teacher has become a "lead case."</LD>
<LD>   James--whose wife, Gricelda, was killed on the 79th floor of the
World Trade Center's south tower--was one of 10 pro bono clients
selected by the American Trial Lawyers Assn. in February to test the
waters of the federal compensation program for relatives of those who
died Sept. 11. He is expected to be among the first dozen or more
awards--averaging $1.5 million each--to be announced as early as
today.</LD>
<LD>   For this small group, the complex paperwork is complete. Hearings
have been held, experts consulted. And as a lead case out of a
potential pool of more than 3,000 trade center applications for the
dead and injured, James stands to receive more than $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess you could say this is liberating, because I won't have to
deal with this situation anymore--a load off my shoulders, I guess,
in a way," James said.</TE>
<TE>   He paused, trying to sum up the year he has had to think every day
about Gricelda and the wrenching phone call she made to him from her
office after the planes had hit, terrified that she was going to die.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pretty sure that they have tried to do this in the best way
they can," James said. "But I don't see there being a 'best' way.
There is no best way."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master assigned to oversee the
victims' fund, said the initial awards were chosen because they were
"the easiest, the most complete and those that came in first."</TE>
<TE>   More than 650 claims have been filed, he said, out of "roughly
3,300" possible submissions. Feinberg said many families may not have
filed claims because they are still paralyzed by grief, and others
may be waiting to see what the first awards look like. The government
announced its first official settlement this month, a $1.04-million
payment to the family of an unnamed male victim in his 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Claimants relinquish the right to sue the federal government,
Feinberg said, but may sue foreign nations or individuals. After the
compensation program ends in December 2003, he said, "anybody who has
not filed a claim is cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Once awards are announced, families may challenge the amount by
requesting a hearing. When a settlement is accepted, a check usually
will be delivered within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   James and his lawyer said they believe his settlement will be
somewhat below the average figure. Whatever the sum, James will split
the money with Gricelda's two adult sons from her first marriage. He
also will make sure her elderly parents in Honduras are taken care
of. He views the settlement with a sense of numbness.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no value, there's no value for Gricelda," said James,
whose 44-year-old wife of three years perished in the real estate
office where she worked as an administrative assistant. "If gold is
the best that we have in this world, she was gold. If there's
something better than gold, she was that too."</TE>
<TE>   But the cold calculations of the compensation system left little
accommodation for sentiment. The victims ranged from chief executives
to busboys, from executives at the peak of multimillion-dollar
careers to middle-aged women like Gricelda James, who earned $30,000
a year.</TE>
<TE>   The daunting nature of the process of recovering damages was what
prompted the trial lawyers to found TLC--Trial Lawyers Care.
Volunteer lawyers have provided free legal assistance to about 1,300
relatives of victims.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Michael James, "we thought it would be beneficial
to be a lead case, for Ken Feinberg to consider our case first," said
Anthony Marchetti Jr., who has represented James since February.
"It's a new law, and you can't have a new law with every detail and
every circumstance written into it. There are issues in which the
master has to make policies."</TE>
<TE>   Eight years out of law school, Marchetti, 33, practices civil law
in a small firm in southern New Jersey. The day after the towers
collapsed, Marchetti knew he had to do something to help, and soon
volunteered his legal services.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lawyer. I don't move metal. I don't own a tractor and I
can't dig," he said. "I care, and I wanted to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the tragedy, James received an emergency handout of "a
few thousand dollars" from the Red Cross to help him pay credit card
bills and his mortgage. The Red Cross also paid for James to fly to
Honduras, where he held a memorial service for Gricelda and brought
her 18-year-old son, Jairo Castro, back to the U.S. to live with her
other son, Jacobo Castro, 26, in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Every two weeks, James received $1,200 from New York state's Crime
Victims Board. The Salvation Army gave him a onetime payment of less
than $1,000. His weekly payment of $750 from workers' compensation
will be subtracted from the federal settlement.</TE>
<TE>   According to Feinberg's formula, any funds received from
charitable organizations are not deducted from the federal
settlement. Life insurance, however, is subtracted. Marchetti will
not disclose the value of Gricelda James' policy, saying only that
after the offset, the claim he submitted on behalf of her family came
to "somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million."</TE>
<TE>   For months, Marchetti and Michael James often spoke daily. They
drove to visit Gricelda's sons in Boston, where they also consulted
two forensic psychiatrists as well as an economist.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death for every World Trade Center victim is listed
as "homicide," and Marchetti's plan was to follow the same strategy
that would apply to any wrongful-death case.</TE>
<TE>   Using calculations devised by Richard Weckstein, professor
emeritus of economics from Brandeis University, Marchetti included
more than $500,000 in "replacement services" in the Gricelda James
claim. This encompassed her cooking, cleaning, bill paying, household
chores, "all the things that she contributed that had financial value
to her family," Marchetti explained.</TE>
<TE>   Marchetti maintained that Gricelda was about to make career
changes that would have brought a big salary increase. She was taking
classes, he said, and working to improve her skills and educational
qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   Weckstein said that Feinberg determined income loss by taking an
average of the last three years' earnings and projecting that figure
with "reasonable estimates of growth." In the case of Gricelda James,
he said, "that would not really be appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Weckstein prepared two parts to his presentation. In one, he
followed the special master's rules "to the letter." In the second,
he argued that Gricelda James would probably have increased her
salary so much that "the ultimate number would be 20% or 30% higher."</TE>
<TE>   But Feinberg dismissed such computations as speculative. His
mandate from Congress was straightforward: Start with "the economic
loss of the victim;" then add noneconomic loss such as pain and
suffering; then deduct "collateral" income sources, such as life
insurance, pensions and workers' compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "And that is the number you get, tax-free," Feinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the deceased probably were contemplating career changes,
said Feinberg, "but life is unfair. In order to compute economic
loss, we need not to speculate but to look at the track record of the
deceased. The guy who was the busboy who was 25 years old and who
died leaving two children and a wife who now says he was about to go
to medical school--she can complain that he was going to be a
neurosurgeon. But we can't compensate for hypotheticals and
speculation."</TE>
<TE>   Another Boston economist, Evan Schouten, worked as a volunteer to
help Feinberg craft his formula. She said the evaluation was based
strongly in the law's tradition of awarding payments for wrongful
death.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a novel approach," said Schouten, who lost a colleague
on the first plane to hit the World Trade Center. "But it is an
approach we're not used to seeing for 3,300 people. It is only
astonishing because ... we have to put a busboy up against a CEO, or
a 63-year-old up against a 22-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   One technique the special master adopted, Schouten said, was to
eliminate race and gender from salary projections--basing all
calculations on earning levels of white males, the most highly paid
group of workers.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg described the application process as rigorous--and
cumbersome--because so much documentation is required. Congress
placed no cap on the fund, which could run between $4 billion and $7
billion, Feinberg noted. By some estimates, private charities may add
another $1 billion to the amount doled out.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about giving away billions of dollars, tax-free,"
he said, "so fill out the 30-page form."</TE>
<TE>   The compensation system, said Michael James, is just that: a
complicated process that ultimately ascribes a dollar figure to a
loved one's life.</TE>
<TE>   "I discussed it sometimes with her sons. I told them, the only way
that we can get compensated is through money," James said. "We just
have to go through with it."</TE>
<TE>   Some days that is harder than other days. Some days, his energy
evaporates and he cannot fill out one more form. He still has not
returned to work. Maybe in January, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, Gricelda and I were so happy. We were so happy with our
house. I was so happy, just cutting the grass," he said. "All of that
is gone. You lose a lot of motivation. You want to understand that
people have organized to help, but it is just too much. Dealing with
compensation and so forth, it gets to you, and you don't want to deal
with it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Still, on June 28, James' lawyer was able to submit to the special
master a 2-inch binder filled with papers about the life of Gricelda
James. On the cover was a photograph of the wife whom James first met
more than 35 years ago when both were children in Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on July 8, Marchetti met with Feinberg. "He was gracious, he
was more than patient with us," the lawyer said. "But we had a time
slot."</TE>
<TE>   To keep his perspective--and perhaps his sanity--Michael James
thinks of the award as "just a gift from Gricelda."</TE>
<TE>   He said, "We need to move on. We need to get this step over with
so we can move on. I don't want to drag it on, I really don't."</TE>

<HD>Study: No Evidence Clone Products Unsafe</HD>
<DH>Science: Report to FDA may ease entry into marketplace. But
panel warns of consequences if genetically altered animals escape
into wild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top scientists have advised federal officials that there is "no
evidence yet" that products from cloned animals are unsafe for human
consumption, in a report released Tuesday that reduces the roadblocks
now keeping such products off supermarket shelves.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, experts warned that genetically altered animals
capable of escaping and breeding with wild populations could
devastate ecosystems--a possibility the current regulatory system is
not equipped to prevent, the study's authors said.</LD>
<LD>   Food and Drug Administration officials said the much-anticipated
report, which they requested from the National Academy of Sciences,
provides a "sound basis" to create regulations for allowing the
rapidly emerging industry of cloned and genetically altered animals
to enter the food supply.</LD>
<TE>   "We know that obviously these animals exist today, so the
technology is already upon us," said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of
the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Sundlof said FDA officials are still reviewing the report and
emphasized that current policy prohibits genetically altered or
cloned animal products from being marketed or sold as food.</TE>
<TE>   But he said questions raised by scientists about cloned animal
food products appeared straightforward. Asked what that meant for
consumers, Sundlof said the likelihood was that cloned animal food
products entering the market "may not be that far down the road." It
is a prospect the industry has anticipated. Cloned cows at the
University of Connecticut and a private company in Wisconsin have
been producing nearly four times the milk of the average dairy cow
since last year--milk currently being destroyed under federal
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have used viruses to target the growth hormones of
fish, creating salmon that grow as much as four times faster than
already fast-growing farm-raised products.</TE>
<TE>   The 179-page report, described as the first big-picture look at
the implications of animal biotechnology on the food supply, was
released by the National Research Council, a private organization
made up of top researchers who regularly advise the government on
scientific issues.</TE>
<TE>   Panel members studied dozens of scientifically reviewed articles
to identify and explore concerns raised by the alteration of food
through animal biotechnology. Still, the report's authors cautioned
that rapid growth and advances in the field made it difficult to draw
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "As is the case with any new technology, it is almost impossible
to state there is no concern, and in certain areas of biotechnology
we did identify some legitimate ones," said the panel's chairman,
John G. Vandenbergh, a North Carolina State University zoology
professor.</TE>
<TE>   Vandenbergh said most of the serious identifiable risks came not
from concerns about people consuming genetically manipulated animal
products but from the potential effect of such animals on the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The report identifies potential hazards facing consumers who eat
cloned and genetically altered animal products but describes the
risks as minimal. For example, there is a likelihood of allergic
reactions to such products because genetically manipulating the
animals will create new proteins. However, until people begin to
consume the products, it is impossible to predict what the reactions
will be.</TE>
<TE>   Vandenbergh also said scientists working on the report found
little cause for fears that genetic alterations made to animals could
somehow transfer to humans who eat them. But there may be exceptions.
Infants and people suffering from severe gastrointestinal illness in
which the stomach lining is not normal could potentially absorb the
altered proteins into their bloodstreams.</TE>
<TE>   He said the committee concluded there is far greater risk of
illness from traditional sources such as E. coli in beef or
salmonella in chicken.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the panel said there were gaps in the research
available to them that need to be filled in by the FDA and other
regulatory agencies. For instance, the committee said it was
difficult to identify all possible concerns because it lacked
complete information about the food composition of cloned
products--analysis it said could be done using available tests.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the animal biotechnology industry said Tuesday that
concerns raised by the report underscored their calls for tighter
federal oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with Environmental Defense, a
nonprofit organization, called the hazards connected to genetically
engineered fish "especially troubling" because the FDA is considering
approval of a genetically altered fast-growing Atlantic salmon.
Approval, however, likely is still years away.</TE>
<TE>   Goldburg and others said Congress should act immediately to
protect the environment. Asking the FDA to handle the entire animal
biotechnology industry was "like asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to regulate food safety using only environmental laws,"
Goldburg said.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's Sundlof said his agency has no desire to go it alone
when it comes to regulating animal biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues are quite different with live animals," he said. "And
that's where we are going to need additional expertise outside of the
FDA to develop the appropriate policy."</TE>

<DH>Courts: The daughter of slain teacher Dave Sanders will get
$1.5 million. The sheriff's office admits no wrongdoing in the death.</DH>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The daughter of a teacher who bled to death during the 1999 Columbine
High School shootings has reached a $1.5-million settlement in her
lawsuit against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.</LD>
<LD>   The sheriff's office admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement
announced Tuesday and both sides still disagree about whether more
could have been done to help the teacher, Dave Sanders.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter, Angela Sanders, said she is satisfied that law
enforcement agencies nationally have changed the way they respond to
mass shootings because of the April 20, 1999, Columbine massacre,
which left Sanders, 12 students and their teen killers dead.</LD>
<TE>   She said commanders, not police officers and sheriff's deputies,
mishandled the response.</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions were made that meant my dad didn't get the help he
needed when he needed it, and I wanted to make sure that nothing like
that ever happened to anyone else's dad again," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, 47, was shot twice in the shoulder as he shepherded
students from the school's library.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleged that deputies stopped students and teachers
from trying to rescue Sanders. The suit also claimed that sheriff's
officials did nothing to help him even after they learned the gunmen,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were dead.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders' lawsuit was the only one brought by relatives of
Columbine victims that was not thrown out by a federal judge last
year.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling allowing the suit to move forward, Judge Lewis
Babcock said sheriff's officials demonstrated "a deliberate
indifference toward Dave Sanders' plight shocking to the conscience
of this federal court."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant County Atty. Bill Tuthill said the sheriff's office's
insurer, which he did not name, decided to settle.</TE>

<HD>Town Weighs Price to Pay for Justice</HD>
<DH>Crime: A judge rules a community is too poor for a death
penalty case. But objections are raised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McARTHUR, Ohio--In the airless courthouse on Main Street today, the
talk will be of justice--how much it costs, and how much it's worth.</LD>
<LD>   At issue: Whether Vinton County can afford to put an accused
murderer on trial for his life.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling that shamed and infuriated many of his neighbors,
local Judge Jeffrey L. Simmons earlier this month decreed that the
county was too poor to stage a death penalty trial for 25-year-old
Gregory McKnight, who is accused of kidnapping a college student and
shooting her in the head.</LD>
<TE>   Vinton County's finances were so precarious, Simmons explained,
that he could not guarantee McKnight would get adequate resources to
defend himself. "This risk," he wrote, "is unacceptable." So the
judge struck the capital charges from the indictment and declared
that McKnight would face a maximum sentence of life in prison, with
the possibility of parole in perhaps 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   National experts said it was the first time they had ever heard of
such a ruling. Prosecutors immediately appealed; they plan to raise
the issue this morning at a pretrial hearing, although they are not
certain Simmons will hear them out.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want two systems of justice in Ohio, one for rich
counties and one for poor counties. The law's the law," county
prosecutor Timothy Gleeson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not cost-efficient to prosecute criminals. But we have an
obligation to do it. Otherwise, our laws are meaningless," added Joe
Case, a spokesman for the state attorney general. "You cannot put a
price tag on justice."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers dismiss such rhetoric as naive: Of course justice
carries a price tag, they say--one that often determines who lives
and who dies. They contend, for instance, that prosecutors in hard-up
counties may be more willing to plea bargain to avoid the huge cost
of holding a death penalty trial.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the same lawyers who are representing McKnight got
a plea bargain for a client accused of murder in another impoverished
county; instead of facing the death penalty, he will be eligible for
parole in 33 years. "No one ever said that cost was a factor, but
you'd have to convince me otherwise," said attorney K. Robert Toy,
who is representing McKnight. "Judge Simmons just had the courage to
announce out loud what everyone else is thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in poor rural counties across the nation, judges and
politicians long have complained that capital cases can break the
bank. In some jurisdictions hit with high-profile trials, officials
have cut public services and considered tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you run a death penalty system means you don't do a
lot of other things, whether it's hot school lunches or whatever,"
said Victor Streib, a scholar of capital punishment who teaches law
at Ohio Northern University. "Maybe in a small county it's more
obvious, but even in large urban areas, there's a constant drain on
public funds."</TE>
<TE>   Yet many here say no expense is too great when justice is at
stake.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to go full out. Otherwise, what kind of message are you
going to send?" wondered Shirley Ward, 64, a bookkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like in your family budget, if you have $100 to spend,
you have to decide whether to pay the electric bill or go to the
movies. Well, this is the electric bill, not the movies," Beverly
Argabright, a 48-year-old clerical assistant, added as she dived into
a salad at the Harvest House restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   At the next table, 31-year-old Marcus Games put down his newspaper
to object: "This is the second-poorest county in the state. Using our
precious resources to murder someone is just ridiculous. We have so
many other needs."</TE>
<TE>   That's a minority opinion here. But barely. Many of those who say
the county must pursue the death penalty do so with obvious
reluctance; they acknowledge that they are loath to spend so many
taxpayer dollars on an accused murderer when there's so much need in
Vinton County. "I can really see both sides," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   One in four children in the county lives in poverty. Unemployment
tops 12%. In hand-lettered signs along a winding two-lane road,
residents advertise their skills, hoping for work: "Lawn mower
repair." "Trenching." "Firewood cut, stacked."</TE>
<TE>   The county is beautiful, tucked into the green fringe of
Appalachia in southeast Ohio, with just 13,000 residents scattered
among miles of rolling fields. Yet the coal seams that once ran so
deep are scraped bare. The forests that once stretched so far have
been logged. There is little industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the office where county commissioners work elbow to elbow,
officials track the general fund budget to the penny: $72,835.24 will
be spent this year on economic development, $13,846.08 on litter
pickup and recycling. McKnight's trial cost is not accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio law requires defendants in capital cases to have two
attorneys. Since McKnight is indigent, taxpayers must cover the tab.
If the defendant is convicted, he is entitled to bring in family
members, psychiatrists and other witnesses to argue to the jury that
he should not be executed. Again, the public pays the bills. If the
death penalty is imposed, automatic appeals add still more expense.</TE>
<TE>   In the McKnight case, the state pitched in to cover most of the
prosecution cost, sending experienced attorneys from Columbus to
prepare the case and performing forensic tests at no expense to
Vinton County. But by law, the state need only cover one-third of the
defense bill. The county is on the hook for the rest. McKnight's
attorneys estimate that the county's expenses could top $200,000.
That's way more than Vinton County spends in a year to operate its
civil, criminal, probate and juvenile courts combined.</TE>
<TE>   As the trial judge, Simmons must authorize each defense
expenditure. He suggested in his ruling Aug. 8 that he would be
uncomfortable doing so. "It would be disingenuous to suggest that a
trial judge can consider such requests without an awareness of the
financial impact on this county," he wrote. "The court finds that the
potential impact of financial considerations could compromise the
defendant's due process rights."</TE>
<TE>   Those who control the county purse strings respectfully dissent.
They insist they can find the money to give McKnight a fair trial,
even if they have to defer equipment upgrades, freeze staff salaries
or skimp on office supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first death penalty case anyone here can remember,
and it does put a hardship on the county, but we can get by," said
Michael Bledsoe, who presides over the Board of Commissioners. "I've
said it dozens of times: Vinton County is a can-do county."</TE>
<TE>   As he points out, even though the county is poor, residents did
vote a few years back to tax themselves--an average of $75 per year
per household--to build a red-brick high school. There's no money for
a fire department, so two dozen men put themselves on call around the
clock as volunteers--and raise enough money through Monday night
bingo games for equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a small county, but we're a proud county," said Larry
Clary, who has served as county treasurer for 25 years. "We'll come
up with what we need to pay for this case. We'll do what we have to
do."</TE>

<HD>Looking to Future of Defense</HD>
<DH>Military: Bush will meet Pentagon officials today to plan
the transition to lighter, quicker weapons seen as essential, though
not in an attack on Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush and his top defense officials meet here today to plot
the next stage of their campaign to invest the military more in
lighter, more mobile weaponry at the expense of traditional weapon
systems.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting at Bush's ranch comes as the Pentagon continues to
ready itself for the possibility of military action against Iraq, a
fight that would rely greatly on the very types of heavy weaponry out
of favor with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</LD>
<LD>   But almost two years into Bush's tenure, pressure is building on
the president's national security team to make significant progress
on an endeavor critical to the military's long-term health: shearing
traditional programs to further the cutting-edge, highly technical
systems that will be critical to fighting future wars.</LD>
<TE>   Since coming into office, Bush and Rumsfeld have consistently
pledged to pare down and modernize the sprawling military. But they
have encountered formidable foes in a collection of regional,
military and industry interests who have slowed their efforts. They
have been criticized--first for failing to consult Congress or the
uniformed military on their thinking, then for failing to propose the
bold steps they had promised.</TE>
<TE>   Now Bush appears to be seeking to give the transformation effort
new life. Programs that could be on the cutting block this fall
include the Air Force's F-22 radar-evading fighter, the Marines' V-22
tilt-rotor Osprey and the Army's Comanche reconnaissance
helicopter--all supremely expensive weapon systems that, Rumsfeld
aides argue, slow down the movement to a lighter, more modern and
more flexible military.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and other White House
officials took pains Tuesday to emphasize that the meeting was not
called to plan a war against Iraq or even to consider what course to
follow in the effort to remove Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from
power. He pointed out that Gen. Tommy Franks, who heads the U.S.
Central Command based in Florida and who would thus be at the center
of any such military planning, had not been invited.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Fleischer said, one of the goals was to take the lessons
of the military campaign in Afghanistan and apply them to the
battlefield of the future.</TE>
<TE>   And one of those lessons, he said, is "the role that technology
plays in helping America be ... lighter and more lethal."</TE>
<TE>   He said Bush had spoken often about the need to think about how
wars should be fought in the new century.</TE>
<TE>   "Wars against a shadowy enemy, for example, require a whole
different type of approach, a different type of lethality, a
different type of speed, a different type of footprint than your more
traditional wars of the 20th century, which involve massive movements
of troops and vehicles and involve flotillas of ships that would
attack the United States," he said. "That's 20th century thinking,
and the president wants to really push ahead to develop a Pentagon of
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that, since Sept. 11, the Pentagon's focus has been
on the immediate needs of protecting the United States and that the
meeting today will provide an opportunity to keep attention on that
mission while also looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Rumsfeld is bringing Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director
of the Missile Defense Agency, to help brief Bush on the future of
the $8-billion-a-year missile defense program that is undergoing
rapid change and expansion. Also attending the meeting will be Vice
President Dick Cheney, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and
Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.</TE>
<TE>   The missile defense program's primary focus at the moment is the
construction of a test center in Alaska that the administration hopes
to begin using as early as September 2004 to evaluate a range of new
technologies. Officials also hope to be able to use the test facility
by 2005 as the base for a rudimentary antimissile system in the event
of an attack by North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a Cold War-era treaty that limited antimissile
systems, the Pentagon has begun experimenting with a variety of ways
to shield U.S. troops and soil from missile attack.</TE>
<TE>   The testing program will take years, and officials say the
president will not need to make major decisions on the system's
architecture for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no decisions that I know of that are pending or
imminent at all," said Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman
for the Missile Defense Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Bush may be briefed on the status of a short-range antimissile
system, the Patriot Advanced Capability 3, which is related to a
system used in the Persian Gulf War and would probably be fielded to
protect troops in the event of a new war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The system could be a key defensive weapon if Iraq sought to
attack troops or other countries in the region with chemical or
biological warheads, military officials say. Army officials have not
been satisfied with the Patriot's performance in recent tests, but
the contractor and missile defense officials have insisted that it is
greatly improved over its error-prone predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld may also raise his increasing concern over the threat to
the United States from cruise missiles. These low-flying missiles
have a shorter range than the ballistic missiles that have been the
focus of the administration's efforts. But they have been acquired by
more than 70 countries, and Rumsfeld is concerned that they could be
adapted by adversaries to carry chemical, germ or nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Baker Spring, a defense analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative public policy center in Washington, noted that if the
government decides to do more to protect against a cruise missile
attack, it could be forced to impose additional restrictions on
private aircraft flights.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's focus on missile defense is part of an
acceleration of the shift toward the high-tech gadgetry of warfare
that the Pentagon has relied on since the Persian Gulf War of 1991.
Such a shift from existing aircraft carriers, jet fighters and other
traditional weapons to more futuristic systems that employ stealth,
target with precision and strike from long range is seen by top
administration officials as critical to maintaining America's war
fighting superiority. But it is exceedingly expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Senate passed a $355.4-billion defense
appropriation bill for 2003 that will deliver to the Pentagon the
huge infusion of funds sought by President Bush after the Sept. 11
attacks. Funding for procurement, research, personnel and
operations-and-maintenance programs each grow by at least 9% in the
bill, which adds $34.4 billion to the U.S. defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   But, despite handing the Pentagon its largest funding increase in
two decades, the budget still does not include all the money the
military needs for the array of programs it now has in various stages
of deployment and development.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line here is the bottom line," said Chris Hellman, a
senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a Washington
defense policy center.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy people have pretty much beaten the Iraq thing to
death; they know where they are," Hellman said. "Their biggest issue
now is making the case internationally and on Capitol Hill. But there
really are other irons in the fire. They all concern Rumsfeld's ideas
about transformation, and they all boil down to money."</TE>
<TE>   The morning-long meeting is likely to take place in the
president's house on the 1,600-acre ranch. It is similar to a session
he held a year ago, during his summer break in Central Texas, to look
at long-range Pentagon matters.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, which is not expected to produce specific decisions,
was largely driven by the budget calendar, Fleischer said. He said it
would lead to the framing of budget proposals that Bush will present
in January or February as part of the federal budget that takes
effect the following October.</TE>
<TE>   That budget planning, he said, "really kicks in in the fall."</TE>
<TE>   "So this is an early window to start looking at the framework for
some of those bigger decisions that have yet to be made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleischer said it was unlikely that the group would deal with
specific budget amounts for long-range projects.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Hijackers' Fake ID Case</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A man accused of providing fake IDs to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers
was arrested Tuesday at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport as he returned from Egypt, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamed el-Atriss was detained by customs agents before being
turned over to local authorities late Tuesday. He will be arraigned
Friday in Passaic County.</LD>
<LD>   El-Atriss left for Egypt hours before New Jersey authorities
raided his home and businesses July 31.</LD>
<TE>   According to the FBI, he sold phony IDs to Khalid Almihdhar, who
was on the airliner that crashed into the Pentagon, and Abdulaziz
Alomari, who was aboard one of the planes that hit the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said they did not know whether el-Atriss knew of
the hijackers' plans.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have not filed any charges against el-Atriss,
who is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Egypt. However, Michael
Drewniak, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Newark,
described him as a person "of interest" in an ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Passaic County officials have charged el-Atriss with conspiracy
and with manufacturing and distributing phony documents. They said he
sold hundreds of fake driver's licenses, ID cards, automobile titles
and license plates.</TE>

<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A blaze sparked accidentally by firefighters was corralled Tuesday by
fire crews, but not before it forced about a dozen families to flee
their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The small fire had been set Monday in an effort to rob fuel from
the massive blaze that has raged since mid-July in southwestern
Oregon and Northern California, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Wayne Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Wind whipped embers from the small fire, which grew to about 50
acres before it was controlled, across the Illinois River toward
houses in the community of Agness. No homes were lost, but residents
were shaken.</LD>
<TE>   "It was quite a show," said Willis Crosse, a fishing guide and
volunteer firefighter who elected to stay with his wife to watch over
their home while most of their neighbors left.</TE>
<TE>   He said the fire was "just like a blowtorch sitting at the bottom
of the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   The larger fire, meanwhile, had grown to more than 470,000 acres,
two-thirds the size of Rhode Island, but was 50% contained, Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lines were completed Monday, keeping the fire out of a whitewater
rafting section of the Rogue River, marking a turning point in the
crews' efforts.</TE>
<TE>   About 75 miles of fire lines remain to be built.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not want to characterize things as all buttoned up yet,
but things are looking very good" on the eastern flank, said fire
spokeswoman Rochelle Desser.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, ignited July 13 by lightning, is the largest recorded
in Oregon this century.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, a blaze fanned by high wind leaped a highway in two
places in the Black Hills of South Dakota near Mt. Rushmore, forcing
some residents to evacuate their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Three homes had been destroyed since the fire started Friday
evening, and Gov. William Janklow said it seemed inevitable that more
would be lost. It had burned across 10,000 acres by Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where it's going. We didn't think it would go here,"
Janklow said as he watched the fire along both sides of U.S. 16,
which leads from Rapid City to Mt. Rushmore National Memorial, four
miles south of the wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people had been evacuated, National Guard Maj. Mark
Johnston said Tuesday. The fire was about 40% contained.</TE>
<TE>   Among those forced from their home were Hank and Nancy Jondahl,
who live four miles east of Keystone. They spent the day volunteering
at the fire camp north of Rockerville.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured if the firefighters saved our house, we could at least
hand out water here and help wherever we can," Nancy Jondahl said.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Urge Logging Plan to Help Curb Fires</HD>
<DH>Policy: Critics say president's expected proposal will
exploit fear to change the rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG, ELIZABETH SHOGREN and BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush is expected Thursday to announce changes in federal
rules that would speed up selective logging in national forests,
embarking on a course intended to help prevent the kind of
destructive fires that have plagued Western states this summer.</LD>
<LD>   But environmentalists are complaining that the government is
upending decades of regulations and that the White House is using
fear of fires to cut down trees that are old but healthy, and
fire-resistant, from back-country forests.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the plan have not been made public. But interviews with
U.S. Forest Service officials, other administration officials and
environmentalists shed light on its likely elements.</LD>
<TE>   Formulating what one senior official called a "new approach to
major issues" affecting the management of public land, Bush is
expected to propose removing administrative barriers to cutting
timber from fire-prone forests by streamlining environmental reviews
required before timber harvest can begin.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would make it harder for environmental groups, citizens
and Forest Service employees to appeal logging plans. The timber
industry views such measures as necessary to protect forests.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is flying Thursday from his ranch in Central Texas to one of
southern Oregon's most fire-troubled areas near the border with
California to make the announcement. Oregon and California are among
several states that have suffered catastrophic wildfires this season.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would make it easier to get approval to thin underbrush
and small noncommercial trees as well as "thinning out some
commercial-grade wood" in areas at high risk of fire, a senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   It is built around restructuring the rules that govern appeals of
federal decisions affecting the environment, making the National
Environmental Policy Act less cumbersome. The measure has regulated
governmental environmental action for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official emphasized that the plan was not
intended to open the national forests to "wholesale commercial
logging" but rather to remove the most flammable wood in the forests.</TE>
<TE>   If the choice is between thinning the forest and putting entire
ecosystems at risk, he said, "some thinning is the way to go."</TE>
<TE>   He said the plan is built around a 10-year strategy adopted in May
by administration officials, 17 governors from both parties, local
and tribal officials, academics and environmentalists to seek
consensus on the treatment of federal forests.</TE>
<TE>   It will involve both changes in regulations, intended to make
federal agency environmental rules more consistent with each other,
and greater consideration for the effect logging would have on
animals and other plants earlier in the process. Some changes will
require congressional action.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the need to win approval of the House and Senate and
foreshadowing lengthy political fights to accomplish the full goals
Bush is likely to outline, a senior forest official said: "My gut
tells me if we could have done them on our own we would have done
them.... We can't do it without going to Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Adding that greater attention is needed to the dangers that lurk
in forests in which brush, dead trees and other fuel have been
allowed to build up, he referred to the current rash of fires and
warned: "We could have many, many years just like this."</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists argue that the administration is using the
fires as an excuse to reach for much broader changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all stuck on fires right now, but the Bush administration
is talking about changes in environmental law on the books since
1970," said Susan Ash, wilderness campaign director of the Oregon
Natural Resources Council, an environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Chris West, a vice president of the American Forest
Resource Council, a timber industry group: "We've burned up half a
million acres of Oregon's forests. It's high time the federal
government began to seriously address concerns about the health of
Western forests."</TE>
<TE>   By delving into the forestry issue, Bush is entering an area of
great political sensitivities in Oregon: In the most populated
regions of the state, around Portland, there are strong environmental
sentiments likely to oppose measure to promote logging. But pollsters
report that in the rural areas more economically dependent on the
forests, support grows for more aggressive logging.</TE>
<TE>   With unemployment above 7%, Oregon has consistently been one of
the states with the highest rate of joblessness over the last year.
The timber industry, once the top source of employment, has been
passed by the high-tech industry as the state's biggest provider of
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Moore, a public opinion researcher who conducts polls for
Republican candidates as well as timber concerns and utilities, said
that concern about forest fires had grown so great that "any action
[by Bush] is going to be seen as potentially helpful."</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling is a lot of ground is being burned and the federal
government hasn't done anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Timber sale appeals and court rulings have played a major role in
shaping Forest Service policy in the last 15 years. Logging levels
fell sharply in the Pacific Northwest in the wake of court rulings to
protect the northern spotted owl habitat, and environmental groups
have used timber sale appeals to modify or sometimes halt logging
plans they believe violate environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   Limiting those reviews would require congressional action and
would erode a fundamental right of the public to play a part in
management of public lands, environmental activists complained.</TE>
<TE>   "If what they're going to do is waive our environmental laws, it's
going to take congressional action to do it," said Marty Hayden,
legislative director of Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "If you eliminate appeals and judicial review, you've largely
taken the public out of having a meaningful role in the process,"
Hayden added. "Without the avenue to hold government accountable to
play by the law, then what you're left with is, 'Thank you very much
for your input. We'll get back to you later.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, after a series of wildfires, Congress waived
environmental reviews of sales of salvaged timber across the country
for 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "It caused the reemergence of timber wars in the Pacific Northwest
that had started to quiet down," Hayden said. "The controversy ...
far overshadowed anything it accomplished. Its legacy still haunts
the Forest Service today, and I think Congress will be less inclined
to do that kind of sweeping waiver."</TE>
<TE>   Today several major environmental groups are calling for the
Forest Service to direct the bulk of its fire prevention efforts and
funding to land bordering houses and towns.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put the money where it does the most good," said Sean
Cosgrove, national forest policy specialist for the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Under a seven-point plan they are releasing in Oregon, the Sierra
Club, Wilderness Society, Oregon Natural Resources Council and other
groups are urging the Bush administration to spend $10 billion over
the next five years to protect communities and homes from wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   National fire policy emphasizes community protection, but a great
deal of forest thinning is underway outside of community zones.
Reviewing current forest spending in California, for instance, The
Times found that national forests in the most remote parts of
Northern California were receiving the most generous budgets for fuel
reduction projects, with the least going to forests near urban areas.</TE>

<HD>Barr Defeated in Georgia GOP Primary Election</HD>
<DH>Politics: He is known as a prosecutor in Clinton's
impeachment trial. Rep. McKinney loses in a tough contest against her
Democratic opponent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. Bob Barr, a fiery Republican best known as a prosecutor in
President Clinton's impeachment trial, lost his bid for reelection
Tuesday as Georgia voters chose party nominees for the fall
elections. Another vociferous lawmaker, Democratic Rep. Cynthia A.
McKinney, also was defeated.</LD>
<LD>   Barr, a hard-charging four-term conservative, was beaten by Rep.
John Linder in one of the nation's most closely watched House
Republican primaries. With most precincts reporting, unofficial
returns showed Linder piling up a surprisingly wide and
insurmountable lead. Barr, who had been in a dead heat with Linder in
some preelection surveys, conceded defeat a few hours after the polls
closed.</LD>
<LD>   In a gracious coda to what had become a nasty intraparty fight,
Barr walked into his foe's headquarters to congratulate Linder "for
having run a very good race." He promised a "united party" for the
fall campaign.</LD>
<TE>   McKinney, a five-term liberal frequently allied with Arab causes,
faced a sharp challenge from a candidate backed by pro-Israel donors,
Denise Majette, in a matchup of two African American women that
became a proxy for the Mideast conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Majette had 58% of the vote to 42% for McKinney with 99% of
precincts reporting. "We united this district," Majette said. "My
opponent had divided it for 10 long years."</TE>
<TE>   McKinney offered only tepid support for Majette in the general
election, saying she "will need our prayers to face the coming
storm." She also blamed her loss on "massive Republican crossover"
voting, which is allowed under Georgia's open primary system.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the Republicans wanted to beat me more than the
Democrats wanted to keep me," said McKinney, who was seeking a sixth
term.</TE>
<TE>   The winners of these two primaries in suburban Atlanta are heavily
favored in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia contests marked a pivot in this year's battle for
Congress. While voters in some states will nominate their candidates
in September, primary season is winding down. With Labor Day less
than two weeks away, the two major parties are now kicking into high
gear in their drive to win control of the House and the Senate in
November's mid-term elections.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia also offered one of the best examples this year of the
political flux produced by the decennial reapportionment of the
House. With the fast-growing state due to pick up two new House seats
in the next Congress, the Democratic legislature and governor redrew
district boundaries in an effort to help their party squeeze out
Republicans. The GOP currently holds eight of 11 House seats.
Democrats, in their best-case scenario, hope to take seven of the
state's 13 seats in the 108th Congress.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the redistricting, Barr and Linder chose to fight
for the right to represent the solidly Republican 7th Congressional
District in the northern suburbs of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Barr, 53, is one of the most prominent members of the Republican
class of 1994, whose victories enabled the GOP to take over the
House. He is an oft-quoted fixture on the House Judiciary Committee
and was one of the first in Washington to call for Clinton's
impeachment in connection with the Whitewater and Monica S. Lewinsky
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Barr has been an occasional critic of the Bush administration's
law enforcement policies, championing a libertarian viewpoint even as
the government has moved to assume greater powers to fight terrorism.
However, most of his voting record follows the party line.</TE>
<TE>   Linder, 59, came to Congress two years before Barr and is known as
a quiet lieutenant of the Republican leadership. He was a top
strategist for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and is now a senior
member of the House Rules Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Both GOP candidates strongly opposed gun control and abortion
rights and strongly favored cutting taxes. With so little to
distinguish them on bread-and-butter Republican issues, the campaign
focused mainly on style. Barr characterized himself as the more
out-front leader, Linder as the more polished legislator.</TE>
<TE>   In one pointed television commercial, Barr depicted himself as a
bulldog and Linder as a dachshund. Linder fired back with an
advertisement that likened Barr to McKinney, belittling both as
ineffective critics.</TE>
<TE>   Barr had the endorsement of the National Rifle Assn., and the
group's president, actor Charlton Heston, campaigned for him in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   But in one of the oddest moments on the trail, Barr was handling
an antique pistol at a campaign event and the gun accidentally fired.
No one was hurt, but Linder seized on the incident to note that he
would never handle a gun unsafely.</TE>
<TE>   In the 4th Congressional District, based largely in DeKalb County,
to the east of Atlanta, McKinney, 47, faced an unexpectedly strong
challenge from Majette, a 47-year-old former state court judge.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates depended on campaign cash from out of state. Much
of McKinney's came from Arab American or Muslim groups, much of
Majette's from Jewish and pro-Israel groups.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney drew controversy twice after Sept. 11. Once, she
suggested that President Bush may have failed to stop the terrorist
attacks because his supporters stood to profit from the ensuing war.
In another incident, she sought to steer toward black charities
donations from a Saudi prince who had urged the United States to
revise its pro-Israel policy.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney made no apologies, saying that she simply supported peace
in the Middle East and a thorough inquiry into what the Bush
administration knew before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   She attacked Majette as a stand-in for Republicans beholden to the
insurance industry. Majette countered that McKinney had little to
show for her 10 years in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The McKinney-Majette contest was the second this year in which a
black House Democrat faced a primary challenge linked to the Mideast
conflict. In June, Rep. Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama was unseated by
Artur Davis, who had courted pro-Israel constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   In other Georgia voting, White House-backed Rep. Saxby Chambliss
defeated two opponents in the GOP primary and will face freshman
Democratic Sen. Max Cleland in November. Cleland was unopposed.
Former state Sen. Sonny Perdue won the three-way GOP race to
challenge Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere Tuesday, Wyoming businessman Eli Bebout won the GOP
primary to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Jim Geringer. He will face
Democrat Dave Freudenthal, a former federal prosecutor.</TE>

<HD>FBI Bulletin Links a New Suspect to Sept. 11 Hijackers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nearly a year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI issued a worldwide
bulletin Tuesday night seeking the arrest of a Saudi man newly
identified as a suspected associate of the hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   The bulletin issued to law enforcement across the globe sought the
arrest of Saud A.S. al Rasheed, 21, of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said the sudden bulletin was based on information
developed over the last few days, and it warned police that Al
Rasheed should be considered armed and dangerous.</LD>
<TE>   "On Aug. 15, 2002, material previously recovered during the war on
terrorism [was] found to be related to several of the Sept. 11
hijackers," the FBI statement said. The materials included an image
of a Saudi Arabian passport belonging to Al Rasheed that had been
issued in Riyadh in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A senior law enforcement official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday night that Al Rasheed's picture was found
among photos of several hijackers in materials obtained overseas some
time ago and recently reviewed by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The official said he did not know how long the government
possessed the information before making the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Al Rasheed's whereabouts are not known, the FBI bulletin said.
Several government officials said the bureau doesn't believe Al
Rasheed is now in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies overseas were advised to contact the
local United States embassy if they have any information regarding
his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   A picture of Al Rasheed was posted on the FBI Web site Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau has on occasion issued alerts over the last year, but
most have involved new terrorist threats and not suspected associates
of the hijackers whose activities have been investigated over the
last 11 months.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush is enjoying strong job approval ratings among Latinos,
a new national poll shows, which may open doors for the GOP in this
fall's congressional elections.</LD>
<LD>   Latinos traditionally have been a reliable Democratic
constituency. But the survey for the business-backed Latino Coalition
found that the Republican president would beat former Vice President
Al Gore by 50% to 35% in a hypothetical matchup. A year ago, the
group's poll found that Latinos would have preferred Gore, a
Democrat, by 54% to 28%.</LD>
<LD>   "Latinos now see the Republican Party as the party of President
Bush, not [California Gov.] Pete Wilson and other anti-immigrant
Republican leaders," said Roberto de Posada, president of the
coalition. "But if Republican candidates do not address issues of
concern to Latinos, the door President Bush is opening will
disappear."</LD>
<TE>   While Bush garnered a 68% job approval rating, Latinos were almost
evenly split on the performance of congressional Republicans, with
42% approving and 39% disapproving. In contrast, congressional
Democrats won a 54% job approval rating.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican who does not appear to be helped by Bush's aura is
California gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. Democratic
incumbent Gray Davis led Simon, 55% to 21%, among California Latinos
in the poll.</TE>
<TE>   De Posada said the congressional GOP is doing better than in last
year's poll, in which only 23% of Latinos held a favorable view of
Republican lawmakers. However, the wording of the questions in the
two polls is different and may invalidate a direct comparison.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the poll found that 44% of Latinos are inclined to vote
for a Democrat in the congressional elections, while 32% lean toward
the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino Coalition, which claims 15,000 members nationwide, is
trying to position itself as a more conservative alternative to
traditional, Democratic-leaning Latino civil rights organizations.</TE>
<TE>   De Posada was director of Hispanic affairs for the Republican
National Committee from 1989 to 1992, but is now a registered
independent. He said he left the Republican camp because the party
was unwilling to make substantive policy changes to appeal to
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hispanic vote is accessible to those who want to seek it," De
Posada said. "The results of this study are clearly a wake-up call
for both major political parties. The days of one party writing off
this block of voters, and the other party taking them for granted,
are over."</TE>
<TE>   He said the support for Bush is the result of the president's
efforts to reach out to Latinos and may also reflect an upsurge in
patriotic sentiment after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza,
said some findings of the Latino Coalition poll have been reflected
in other surveys. Favorable perceptions of Bush and a sense that the
Latino vote is becoming competitive are not new. "What is new is that
this is the first poll I've seen that shows Bush ahead in a
head-to-head comparison with Gore," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have launched a major communication campaign in the
Latino community this year, featuring a 30-minute television program
airing on Spanish-language television in selected markets. De Posada
said the new willingness of Latinos to listen to the GOP will prove
ephemeral if Republicans don't follow up with policy changes on
immigration and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, while 83% approved of Bush's proposal to grant legal
status to 3.5 million undocumented Mexican immigrants, only 53%
approved of his overall handling of immigration issues. The
legalization plan has been on hold since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that immigration and discrimination are the top
issues for Latinos, followed by education and jobs. Thirty-one
percent said they personally had experienced discrimination in the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   There were notable differences on some issues among Latinos who
are established in the United States and mainly speak English, and
those who are more recent arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 64% of Latinos said attitudes of other Americans toward
them were unchanged as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks. But among
the 35% who noted a change, English-speaking Latinos said by 2 to 1
it was positive, while Spanish speakers reported a negative fallout
by nearly the same ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Differences, however, all but vanished on the issue of legalizing
undocumented workers, which enjoyed strong support from Latino ethnic
groups, including Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of cultural identity, which has defined many debates
about immigration and language, nearly 56% said they felt Latinos
should become more a part of American society, even if it means
losing some traditions. But 33% said they would prefer to keep their
own culture, even if it means staying somewhat separate from other
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The poll was based on interviews with 1,000 Latino adults, about
60% of whom were registered voters. It was conducted by McLaughlin &amp;
Associates Opiniones Latinas earlier this month and has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Insanity Plea Planned for Pipe Bomb Suspect</HD>
<DH>Crime: Motion is expected to delay the start of trial for
Luke Helder, who is accused of planting explosives in mailboxes in
five states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa</DL>
<LD>The attorney for Luke Helder, accused of planting pipe bombs in
mailboxes in five states, will argue that the former college student
was unable to discern right from wrong during a crime spree in May.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Public Defender Jane Kelly said in papers filed in
U.S. District Court that she will argue the insanity plea at the
trial, which is scheduled for Nov. 18.</LD>
<LD>   But Kelly's defense strategy and other complications likely will
push back the trial date. A joint motion filed by Kelly and federal
prosecutors asks the court for more time for pretrial motions and to
delay the start of the trial. A judge has yet to rule on the request.</LD>
<TE>   Using the insanity defense is risky and rarely succeeds, according
to a former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really only successful in a small amount of cases," said
Stephanos Bibas, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York and now
a University of Iowa Law School professor.</TE>
<TE>   "But it certainly adds some uncertainty to the case for jurors, a
lot of extra work for the prosecutors. It sort of serves as some kind
of wild card for the defense."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Sean Berry said Justice Department rules
prevent him from commenting on the case. Kelly did not return phone
messages Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bibas said Helder, at his attorney's request, probably has
undergone a psychiatric evaluation. Prosecutors also can be expected
to hire an expert to test and question Helder, Bibas said.</TE>
<TE>   Helder is accused of putting 18 pipe bombs and antigovernment
letters in mailboxes in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Colorado and Texas
in early May. Six pipe bombs exploded in Iowa and Illinois, injuring
four letter carriers and two residents.</TE>
<TE>   The letter said, in part, "If the government controls what you
want to do, they control what you can do.... I'm obtaining your
attention in the only way I can."</TE>
<TE>   Helder, a Pine Island, Minn., resident, faces trial in Iowa on two
charges: using an explosive to damage personal property which
resulted in an injury to a person and using a pipe bomb during a
federal crime of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Helder said after his arrest that they had noticed
profound changes in his mental state in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly must prove Helder had a mental condition that prevented him
from knowing right from wrong, said Bibas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tighter standard than it once had to be," said Bibas, who
is not involved in the Helder case. "The problem is that showing you
were acting strange is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   After the first day, the bombs were not set to explode, but the
fear created by the May 3 explosions stopped mail delivery in Iowa
and parts of Illinois for a day. Helder was arrested May 7 outside
Reno, Nev., and he was returned to Iowa on May 10.</TE>
<TE>   He told authorities in Nevada the placement of the bombs in
mailboxes across the country were to create a smiley face on the U.S.
map.</TE>
<TE>   Helder faces charges in Illinois and Nebraska as well as Iowa. The
former University of Wisconsin-Stout student remains in custody in
the Linn County Jail.</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts Oil Search at Colorado Monument</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock said oil exploration at a national
monument in southwestern Colorado poses a substantial threat of
irreparable harm, and he temporarily blocked the work Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   His ruling gives four environmental groups a chance to seek a
permanent end to oil exploration in a section of the Canyons of the
Ancients National Monument.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing on a preliminary injunction against the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management, which oversees the monument, was set for Aug. 27.</LD>
<TE>   "We're happy and relieved the project won't be going forward
immediately," said Jay Tutchton, director of Earthjustice
Environmental Law Clinic, which is representing the groups.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists claim the BLM's approval of the oil exploration,
set to start next week, violated the National Environmental Policy
Act because it didn't adequately evaluate the potential effects on
the land and wildlife. They also argue the BLM didn't follow Interior
Department guidelines for new oil and gas development in the
164,000-acre preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Monument director LouAnn Jacobson has said the BLM carefully
reviewed the project. She declined to comment Tuesday because the
matter is in court.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Clinton created the Canyons of the Ancients
National Monument in November 2000. The Interior Department has said
it has the highest known density of archeological sites in the
country, more than 20,000, and in some places more than 100 sites per
square mile.</TE>
<TE>   The remnants include cliff dwellings, large circular rooms known
as kivas, farm sites and rock carvings dating back thousands of
years.</TE>
<TE>   The land also has an abundance of oil and gas. A report prepared
for House Republicans by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2001 said the
monument could have moderate to high volumes of oil and gas.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration considers opening more public land to oil
and gas development a key part of its national energy plan. The
Interior Department said when the area was declared a national
monument that established roads and trails would remain open to
previously authorized uses.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson approved the oil exploration in the disputed area Aug. 9
after finding the work would have no significant effect, according to
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The process will involve four 60,000-pound trucks that will
periodically stop to lower a vibrating plate to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Wire strung on the ground will detect the vibrations in the earth
and record the data to determine where oil might be found.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock said in his ruling that the environmental groups will
likely be able to show the BLM and Interior Department violated the
terms of the presidential proclamation that created the monument.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juan Citizens Alliance, the Wilderness Society, the
Colorado Environmental Coalition and the Oil and Gas Accountability
Project filed the lawsuit.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>A man who was cleared by DNA evidence after serving 15 years in
prison for rape will be granted an unconditional pardon by Gov. Mark
Warner, the governor's office said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The pardon is to be issued today for Marvin Lamont Anderson, who
has been on parole since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   "I am convinced that Mr. Anderson is innocent of the charges for
which he was convicted," Warner wrote in his pardon, a copy of which
was obtained by Associated Press. Anderson was convicted and
sentenced to 210 years in prison based on testimony from the victim.</LD>
<TE>   DNA tests have exonerated six Virginia inmates, including one
death row prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a grand jury in suburban Hanover County charged a prison
inmate with committing the rape and robbery for which Anderson was
sent to prison.</TE>

<HD>Police Say Drugstore Robbery Foiled</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three are jailed in New Hampshire, accused of
planning a deadly pharmacy heist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTSMOUTH, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Police arrested three men who they said were planning to storm a
pharmacy Tuesday, kill everyone inside and steal all the drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Officers said they seized submachine guns, semiautomatic handguns
with silencers, bulletproof vests and black clothing with masks from
the three on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "These are highly dangerous and obviously well-armed individuals,"
Police Chief Brad Russ said at a news conference Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   He said they were after money and were not known to be drug
addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty shocking for me to hear about people who had no
regard for human life and who were willing to execute someone for
profit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were arrested Monday evening at a final planning session
that was attended by undercover officers, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were identified as Jay Howard, 24; his brother Jeff
Howard, 21; and Charles Veillette, 32. They were charged with
conspiracy to commit murder, robbery and theft. Veillette is from
Portsmouth, but the other two had no permanent address, police said.</TE>
<TE>   They entered no pleas at their arraignments Tuesday. Bail was set
at $1 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Green's Drug Store was chosen because it would allow
an easy getaway.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacist Richard Philbrook said he didn't know his store had
been targeted until he talked to a television reporter who was the
store's first visitor of the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe my life to the Portsmouth Police Department," said
Philbrook, 56. "It's scary. I'm glad they found out about it ahead of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Tuesday's plan called for carjacking a random motorist
or a courier who delivers prescription drugs to area pharmacies.</TE>
<TE>   Russ said police learned of the alleged plot through a special
investigative unit with "tentacles out there."</TE>

<HD>Annual Teen Drug Study Finds Mixed Results</HD>
<DH>Survey: Most schools are free of illegal substances, but
pot is easier to buy than liquor, students say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT PATRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nearly two-thirds of teenagers say their schools are drug-free,
according to a survey released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But it's good news, bad news for parents, because the survey group
of a thousand 12-to 17-year-olds also says that marijuana is as easy
to get as tobacco and even easier to buy than alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, conducted by Columbia University's National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse, reported that 63% of teens said their
schools were drug-free, slightly more than double the number reported
in 1998. In 1999 and 2000, 44% and 45% of teens called their schools
drug-free, the report said. The center did not conduct a survey in
2001.</LD>
<TE>   The center's president, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the increase
might be due to a greater awareness of the dangers of drug use or an
increase in drug testing in schools. He said the Sept. 11 attacks may
also have played a part, citing greater parental involvement,
increased patriotism among teens or a heightened association between
drug dealing and terrorism as possible factors in lowering drug use.</TE>
<TE>   The annual survey is designed to analyze all the factors that may
come into play as teens decide whether to use alcohol, tobacco or
illegal drugs, Califano said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the survey examined the influence of siblings and
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Teens who think older siblings would be angry if they found out
about marijuana use were less likely to use drugs, as were teens who
thought their siblings were not using illegal drugs, the report
found.</TE>
<TE>   If teens have a good relationship with one or more grandparents,
the risk of drug use is also lower.</TE>
<TE>   "CASA surveys have consistently found that the family is
fundamental in keeping children away from tobacco, alcohol and
illegal drugs," Califano said. Past surveys have stressed the
importance of parental involvement and two-parent households in
reducing teen drug use.</TE>
<TE>   But the survey shows that the 541 parents interviewed are more
pessimistic that their children are using drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Although parents listed drug use as their biggest concern, 35% say
they have "little influence" over whether their teen uses drugs, up
from 25% in 1999, and only 51% of parents described their children's
schools as drug-free.</TE>
<TE>   "Parent power is the most undervalued tool here," Califano said.</TE>
<TE>   California state PTA Vice President Carla Nino echoed Califano's
sentiments about the importance of parental involvement. "From the
PTA's perspective, the best that we can do is educate parents ... on
how to talk to their kids, because that's the hardest thing for
parents to do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Califano also said that controls on the underage purchase of
tobacco seemed to be working but that marijuana was becoming easier
to obtain. The percentage of teens who listed cigarettes as the
easiest illegal drug for minors to purchase fell from 47% in the 1999
survey to 31% in 2002. Marijuana was rated as easiest to obtain by
27% of teens in 1999 and 34% in 2002, but the difference in the ease
of obtaining tobacco and pot was within the study's margin of error.
Alcohol was listed as the most easily purchased by 12% in 1999 and
14% this year.</TE>
<TE>   One-quarter of teenagers said that they have seen drugs being sold
in school or on school grounds, and almost half said they could buy
pot in 24 hours or less--27% in an hour or less.</TE>
<TE>   John P. Walters, the director of the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement that the survey's
findings about the ease of obtaining marijuana "should send a wake-up
call to parents: They need to talk to their children about this
dangerous drug now."</TE>
<TE>   And parents need to start early. The average age for that first
cigarette is just over 12, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Drinkers started at 12 1/2, and marijuana users a year later.</TE>
<TE>   The study pointed to several factors associated with decreased
drug use, including good grades and church attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking, school detention and truancy were associated with
increased drug use.</TE>
<TE>   The center's survey was conducted between late December and early
February in the continental United States.</TE>
<TE>   The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for
teens and 4.2 points for parents.</TE>

<HD>1st Kentuckian Dies of West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRANKFORT, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A man who was hospitalized with West Nile encephalitis died this
week, Kentucky health authorities said Tuesday. It was the state's
first confirmed case of the disease in a human.</LD>
<LD>   Lab tests suggest that Missouri and Texas also may have suffered
their first deaths from the West Nile virus, while in Mississippi,
health officials on Tuesday reported a third death from the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
confirmed that the Kentucky man had the West Nile virus, Cabinet for
Health Services spokesman Gil Lawson said.</LD>
<TE>   The victim was described only as an 84-year-old man with "multiple
health problems" who had been hospitalized for several days and died
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky health officials had said the widespread presence of
birds and horses with West Nile virus in the state meant that a human
case could be expected.</TE>
<TE>   In Missouri and Texas, officials were awaiting confirmation from
the CDC that the cases there were West Nile.</TE>
<TE>   A 75-year-old woman in St. Louis died Aug. 7, and Missouri health
officials said an independent lab test showed that she had tested
positive for West Nile. She was identified as Cora Walton by grandson
Sean Walton, a technician in Associated Press' St. Louis office.</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, a 52-year-old woman died Friday. Ethel Menefee was
hospitalized Aug. 8, according to her sister, Erma Nauling.</TE>
<TE>   "Our lab put her in the probable category [for West Nile], so we
feel like it is going to be confirmed," said Kathy Barton,
spokeswoman for the Houston Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi health officials declined to release the gender or age
of the latest victim there, saying only that the person had been
hospitalized with West Nile encephalitis.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the CDC has reported 12 U.S. deaths this year from
West Nile virus, eight of them in Louisiana. As of Tuesday, 253 human
cases of the virus had been reported to the CDC this year in 11
states and the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile first appeared in the United States in 1999, when seven
people infected with it in New York died. It is transmitted to humans
through mosquito bites.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem's Status Is in Doubt for Pacific Classic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The status of favored War Emblem became uncertain for Sunday's
$1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar after the Kentucky Derby winner
worked a disturbingly fast five furlongs Tuesday at the track.</LD>
<LD>   War Emblem's time was an excessively quick 57 3/5. Ridden by Dana
Barnes, his regular exercise rider, War Emblem sped away on the
backstretch when another horse in training galloped alongside.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't as smooth as we would have liked," trainer Bob Baffert
said. "That other horse jumped in front of him, and that set him off.
He really rambled that first quarter, in something like 22 [seconds]
and change. Dana got him under control, but he had already gone a
half-mile. He came out of it all right, but we'll have to see how he
is. We'll know in a couple of days. If he comes out of it all right,
we're going [to run], but we'll have to see."</LD>
<TE>   War Emblem, who has won the Preakness and the Haskell since his
Derby victory May 4, would be facing older horses for the first time
if he runs in the Pacific Classic. Even before War Emblem's fast
workout, a surprisingly large number of challengers were lining up.
There will probably be a record field for the Pacific Classic, which
has never drawn more than nine horses in 11 runnings.</TE>
<TE>   Trainers of 13 other horses are considering the race. Among the
possibles are Came Home, Bosque Redondo, Milwaukee Brew, Sky Jack,
Momentum, Grey Memo, Arbiter, Bonus Pack, Pleasantly Perfect,
Tapatio, Jimmy Z., Seinne and Speedy Pick. The post-position draw is
scheduled for Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   Former Clipper coach Bill Fitch and the team settled competing
lawsuits arising from his 1998 firing. Although terms were not
disclosed, Clipper attorney Bob Platt confirmed the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The legal battle between the Clippers and Fitch started in April,
2001, when the team sued Fitch for breach of contract, claiming he
had a duty to try to get another NBA coaching job. Such a job would
have voided some or all of the $4 million otherwise owed under
Fitch's 1997 contract extension, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In his countersuit filed in June, 2001, Fitch said he had tried to
get a coaching job and would continue to look for the "right
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   As expected, former All-Star Shawn Kemp was waived by the Portland
Trail Blazers after the team restructured his contract. Terms were
not disclosed. Kemp was working under a seven-year, $107-million
contract he signed with Seattle in 1997.</TE>

Tuesday's conviction of Mike Sweeney, who was running bingo
operations for the New England AAU, one of 56 regional affiliates of

<TE>   Nevertheless, according to interviews and documents obtained by
the Orlando Sentinel, the New England bingo operation generated $12.3
million during the past five years under the national organization's
tax identification number.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's conviction, combined with questions about the national
AAU's failure to report revenue earned under its tax ID number, could

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Tigers have been playing as if they belong in the pennant
race with the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   Damion Easley and Bobby Higginson hit consecutive homers Tuesday
to break a sixth-inning tie and help the Tigers beat the Mariners for
the second consecutive game, 6-3, at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit has won the first two games in the three-game series after
being swept at Seattle on July 10-12.</LD>
<TE>   "Winning games like this gives us some life," starter Mike Maroth
(5-5) said. "Seattle is fighting for the playoffs, and we don't have
a chance to get there, but at least we have a chance to compete in
some important games."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners have lost four of five to fall into a three-way tie
for first place in the American League West with the Oakland
Athletics and Angels, who lead by two percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put ourselves in a bit of a bind by losing two to the
Tigers," said Mike Cameron, who went four for four "We know we have
to do better than this, but we have to do it out on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Easley led off the sixth with his seventh homer into the
left-field stands and Higginson followed with his ninth, a high drive
off the right-field foul pole.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Halter hit a solo homer against Shigetoshi Hasegawa in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Maroth gave up three runs and six hits, and walked two in seven
innings. He struck out two and improved his record at Comerica Park
to 4-1 with a 1.73 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we are stuck on three runs every night," Seattle
Manager Lou Piniella said. "When you are scoring three or less all
the time, it is tough to win."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Cleveland 3--Jermaine Dye hit a three-run homer and
Eric Chavez had a two-run shot at Cleveland, and the Athletics won
their seventh game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Aaron Harang (5-3) took a shutout into the sixth and four
relievers finished, with Billy Koch getting four out for his 32nd
save.</TE>
<TE>   The A's share the lead in the AL West for the first time since
April 10. Oakland has won 13 of 16 and is a season-high 24 games over
.500.</TE>
<TE>   Dye put the A's ahead, 5-0, in the third with a towering drive
onto the home run porch in left field. In his last 15 games, he is
batting .351 (20 for 57) with five homers and 16 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez connected for his 29th homer, a liner to right field that
barely cleared the wall. It was his 100th career homer and eighth in
August.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas 3, Boston 2--Ivan Rodriguez homered to tie the score in the
top of the ninth inning and Todd Hollandsworth's solo shot in the
10th gave the Rangers their fifth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Lowe gave up four hits in seven-plus innings in his bid to
become the AL's first 18-game winner.</TE>
<TE>   He left with a 2-1 lead, but closer Ugueth Urbina blew his fifth
save in 33 chances when Rodriguez led off the ninth with his 11th
home run.</TE>
<TE>   Hollandsworth, fresh off the disabled list, opened the 10th with a
drive against Willie Banks (2-1).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 7, Tampa Bay 4--Gary Matthews Jr. hit a three-run homer
with two out in the bottom of the ninth, capping a four-run rally in
the inning, all unearned.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Huff gave the Devil Rays a 4-3 lead in the top of the ninth
with his 17th home run, a solo drive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Chicago 0--Kyle Lohse pitched a four-hitter at
Chicago and Jacque Jones hit his second leadoff homer in as many
games.</TE>
<TE>   Lohse (11-7) got his first complete game in the 42nd start of his
career. He struck out eight and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins extended their AL Central lead to 16 games over Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Toronto 5--Raul Ibanez hit a three-run homer in the
top of the 12th inning off SkyDome Windows restaurant beyond the
center-field wall for a 6-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But closer Roberto Hernandez nearly gave it all back before
retiring Shannon Stewart on a pop up with runners on first and second
for his 22nd save.</TE>

<HD>Angels Have Staff Issues</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With Appier already hurting, Sele complains of
shoulder pain in Anaheim's 7-5 loss to Yankees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At the very time in the season the Angels hoped to count on the
experience of Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele to guide them toward the
playoffs, they must now worry about whether their veteran starters
can stay out of the training room and on the mound.</LD>
<LD>   With five weeks left in the regular season--or one if players
strike next week and do not return--the Angels are tied with the
Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics atop the American League West.
But, after Sele self-destructed in the Angels' 7-5 loss to the New
York Yankees on Tuesday, he complained of discomfort in his pitching
shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The defeat left the Angels with a percentage-points lead in the
division race. In the games behind column, all three teams are even,
with one playoff bid guaranteed to the division champion and the
wild-card berth possibly going to the second-place finisher.</LD>
<TE>   Sele, 32, is scheduled to be examined today. Appier, 34, was
forced from his Sunday start because of a strained groin and hip, but
he reported no discomfort Tuesday and expects to make his next start.</TE>
<TE>   Sele tied his career high by walking seven batters, four of whom
eventually scored. He also gave up seven hits, and 15 of 29 batters
reached base against him. He could not throw the ball where he
wanted--49 of 100 pitches were balls--his breaking ball lacked its
trademark sharpness, and catcher Bengie Molina said Sele's fastball
had lost about 2 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Sele said nothing about his sore
shoulder until after he was removed, with two on and none out in the
sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he was not upset that Sele had not spoken up sooner,
saying that there was "no huge red flag" alerting the coaching staff
to the injury and that veteran pitchers traditionally know how much
pain they can tolerate.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to the ability to pitch through this," Scioscia
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sele agreed, using Yankee starter Andy Pettitte as an example.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to feel perfect for all your games," Sele said.
"Look at what Andy did."</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte gave up 10 hits--including a third-deck, three-run home
run to Garret Anderson--and still won. He walked none. The Angels
scored five runs in the third inning and presented Sele with a
short-lived 5-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I went back out there and spit it right back out," Sele said.
"When you stink, you stink."</TE>
<TE>   He refused to blame the shoulder pain for the poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't feel good enough to pitch, I won't take the rubber,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   If neither he nor Appier do, that could greatly hurt the Angels'
pennant chances. Jason Giambi, who homered off Sele, said the Angels
and A's have a slight edge over the Mariners because the Angels start
with Appier, Sele and Jarrod Washburn and the A's start with Tim
Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. The Mariners, meanwhile, just
added Angel discard Ismael Valdes to their rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the way the Angels are pitching and the A's are
pitching, you'd have to give them the nod," Giambi said. "We just
came from Seattle, and they're still trying to find that combination
of guys throwing well."</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels aren't overflowing with depth to replace Appier or
Sele for more than a spot start or two. Scott Schoeneweis, who
started the season in the rotation, has not thrown more than two
innings since June 25. Relievers Al Levine or Scot Shields could make
a spot start. At triple A, Matt Wise is on the disabled list because
of a sore right elbow, Lou Pote has started only four games and Chris
Bootcheck seven. Mickey Callaway, who last started a major league
game for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1999, might be the best option,
if one is needed.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, first place is crowded, but the Angels don't mind
sharing for now, considering they were 24 games out of first on this
date last year.</TE>

<HD>A Sobering Visit to Ground Zero</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks approaching, first
baseman Scott Spiezio and broadcaster Rex Hudler visited Ground Zero
on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was very sobering," Hudler said. "For a change, there wasn't a
lot coming out of my mouth.</LD>
<LD>   "To think about how many thousands of people died is
mind-boggling. It makes you grateful to be alive."</LD>
<TE>   Said Spiezio: "You see it on TV, but to see how big it is when
you're there just fries your brain. You just can't grasp it. It's too
huge to even comprehend."</TE>
<TE>   The duo also visited the American Stock Exchange, where Hudler was
booed after telling the assembled traders that the Angels were here
to beat up on the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio then rang the opening bell and was cheered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If fans weren't sure why players might strike Aug. 30, two owners
all but spelled it out in recent days. Players want to act now to
prevent owners from installing a salary cap in the off-season, a
threat unspoken until Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks told the Dallas
Morning News a strike could prompt owners to withdraw the current
proposal and replace it with a cap. San Diego Padre owner John Moores
told the New York Times he is one of several owners prepared to shut
the doors for the 2003 season without major cost-controlling reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, the Angel player representative, said he
wondered whether those owners had spoken out in frustration over the
setting of a strike date. The owners are mistaken, he said, if they
believe such threats might induce players to settle for a deal with a
high luxury tax that the union believes acts as a cap.</TE>
<TE>   "We're unanimously behind not accepting that," he said. "We've
made strides in their direction on revenue sharing and a luxury tax.
If it's all or nothing for them, that's a different situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon said he hoped to return Friday, 13 days
after his left hand was hit and badly bruised by a pitch. On Tuesday,
he visited an orthopedic specialist affiliated with the Yankees, who
took a second MRI and second set of X-rays to confirm there was no
broken bone. Salmon took batting practice Tuesday and said he still
felt pain and weakness in the hand.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Appier, forced from Sunday's game by a strained
groin and hip flexor, said he felt fine Tuesday. Assuming no
discomfort in his between-starts workout today, he is expected to
make his next scheduled start Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Ruth's Bat Will Be Big Hit</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia: One he homered with and signed will be
auctioned next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bat Babe Ruth used to hit the first home run in Yankee Stadium is
expected to make history again in the world of sports memorabilia.</LD>
<LD>   And a Laguna Niguel sports memorabilia shop might cash in on the
bat of the legendary home run hitter the same way the Yankees did.</LD>
<LD>   SportsCards Plus owns the autographed bat that experts say might
surpass the $3 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball in
1998.</LD>
<TE>   This bat could break McGwire's record, said Joe Orlando, vice
president of Professional Sports Authenticators of Newport Beach,
which authenticated the 45-ounce bat during last week's National
Sports Collectors Convention in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Not even a strike by the players will lower the price for the bat.
SportsCards Plus President David Kohler said Tuesday that they plan
to put the bat up for auction next year.</TE>
<TE>   The bat, which Ruth used to hit a three-run home run in the third
inning against the Boston Red Sox on April 18, 1923, was sold to
SportsCards Plus by a woman who had acquired it after Victor Orsatti,
a family member, died in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The woman didn't disclose the bat's selling price and didn't want
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Orsatti, who became a Hollywood talent agent, owned the bat after
winning a California youth home run-hitting contest sponsored by a
local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth autographed and inscribed on the bat: "To the Boy Home Run
King of Los Angeles, 'Babe' Ruth, N.Y. May 7th, 1923."</TE>
<TE>   "This item will be the most expensive item that we've ever
authenticated," Orlando said. "We thought we hit an all-time high
last year."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Professional Sports Authenticators authenticated the
famous Black Betsy bat used by Shoeless Joe Jackson, who was involved
in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. His bat sold on the Internet through
EBay for $577,610, the highest price for a game-used bat.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth's bat held the record before Jackson's. An autographed bat
Ruth used to hit his first home run in the 1924 season sold for
$225,000 just weeks before Jackson's bat sold. A few weeks later, a
sidewritten home run notch bat used by Ruth in 1929 sold for
$320,000. Both Ruth bats were sold privately.</TE>
<TE>   The latest one will be put up for auction.</TE>
<TE>   "The Babe had his home run record broken and he can't get that
back," said Orlando. "He'll get back his record for the highest
selling game-used bat, and I think that this bat has the potential to
make sports memorabilia history as the highest selling price for an
individual item ever."</TE>

<HD>Man Is Sued Over Bonds' Ball</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds hits another historic home run and the man who ends up
with the ball after a fight in the bleachers gets sued.</LD>
<LD>   Last October it was a tussle over Bonds' record-setting 73rd home
run of the season--one man got a glove on it, but another took it
home.</LD>
<LD>   This time, it's a guy who got a ticket to the game after allegedly
promising fellow workers to split any profits on the remote chance he
caught Bonds' 600th career home run ball.</LD>
<TE>   That's just what Jay Arsenault, a 36-year-old carpenter from
Vacaville, did Aug. 9, in the bleachers of Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he's allegedly reneging on a promise to share the wealth,
according to three former friends who have filed suit in Solano
County Court. The story was first reported in the Fairfield Daily
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a judge issued a temporary restraining order, saying
the ball may not be sold.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenault and the baseball have been ordered to appear in court
Sept. 5 for a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Gutierrez's season is over, and now the Cleveland Indian
second baseman is concerned about saving his career.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez said doctors have recommended surgery on his injured
neck, which he hurt while diving for a ball in the first few weeks of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI revealed that disks in Gutierrez's neck are rubbing and
pinching his spinal cord.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez didn't tell the Indians about his neck until last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie right-hander Ryan Drese was optioned by the Indians to
triple-A Buffalo....The Cincinnati Reds sent outfielder Raul Gonzalez
to the New York Mets as part of the deal last week in which
Cincinnati got left-hander Shawn Estes.</TE>

<LD>Spark Coach Michael Cooper has withdrawn as a candidate for a job on
the Denver Nuggets' coaching staff.</LD>
<LD>   Denver, expected to soon name longtime NBA assistant Jeff Bzdelik
as its head coach, had contacted Cooper about joining Bzdelik's
staff.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper, 46, has one year left on his contract with the Sparks but
would be allowed to opt out of it for an NBA coaching position.</LD>
<TE>   According to a Cooper representative, who asked not to be
identified, "a number of NBA teams have called our offices regarding
[Cooper's] interest. He is very gratified to get the calls, but is
under contract with the Sparks for another year. He does hope to be
an NBA coach in the future."</TE>

<HD>Marlins Break Dodgers' String</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After Ishii has a weak outing, Brown gives up
three runs in three innings and offense does little in 6-3 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given the chance to pinch-hit for Kevin Brown in the seventh inning
Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy decided to
leave Brown in and see how close his former ace is to regaining his
old form.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict: Not close at all.</LD>
<LD>   Brown went on to surrender a two-run homer to the Florida Marlins'
Juan Encarnacion in the eighth inning of a game the Marlins went on
to win, 6-3, in front of a crowd of 40,503, ending a five-game Dodger
winning streak. With both the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco
Giants winning, the Dodgers (71-54) dropped eight games back of the
division-leading Diamondbacks and had their lead over the Giants for
the wild-card spot trimmed to 2 1/2 games.</LD>
<TE>   In all, Brown labored through three innings, giving up three runs
and seven hits, waIking two and striking out an equal number.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfair after two major surgeries to ask him to be vintage
Kevin Brown," Tracy said. "We got beat because we didn't have enough
offensive prowess."</TE>
<TE>   It was Brown's second relief appearance since returning from the
disabled list Aug. 15. He has been disabled twice this season for a
total of 90 days because of problems with his right elbow and
subsequent back surgery.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the game, the Dodger offense looked as if the players
were using the Shawn Green kiddie bats handed out to the crowd. The
Dodgers managed only four hits off winning pitcher Brad Penny (6-4)
and two relievers through eight innings, and all were singles.</TE>
<TE>   Encarnacion alone nearly equaled that amount with a single, double
and homer in four at-bats, driving in half the Marlin runs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was not the only Dodger to struggle on the mound Tuesday
night. Starter Kazuhisa Ishii (13-8) failed to maintain the recent
momentum generated by the starting rotation. Over the previous seven
games, Dodger starters had been 4-0 with a 1.70 earned-run average,
giving up a total of 33 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's struggles have often begun with a base on balls. He led
the club going into Tuesday night's game with 95 walks in 139 1/3.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the first man Ishii walked, Preston Wilson, came in
to score. That was in the second inning. Wilson stole second and came
home on a double to left by Encarnacion.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers tied it in their half of the inning on a single by
Green, a bunt single by Paul Lo Duca and an RBI single to right by
Dave Hansen, getting his sixth start of the season at first base.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was back in trouble in the fourth. And again it began with a
walk.</TE>
<TE>   After he put Kevin Millar on, Ishii surrendered back-to-back
singles to Wilson and Derrek Lee. The ball hit by Lee caromed off the
top of third baseman Adrian Beltre's glove and into left field. Left
fielder Marquis Grissom's throw to the plate allowed Wilson to go
third and he scored from there on Mike Lowell's sacrifice fly to
center.</TE>
<TE>   It took Ishii 90 pitches to get through five innings and that was
enough for Tracy. Ishii walked only three men, one of those
intentionally. But both of the others scored.</TE>
<TE>   "The walks are what really hurts Ishii," Tracy said. "If he
doesn't do that, he probably doesn't give up any runs until I pull
him."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii said his control problems were more mechanical than mental
this time.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past," he said, "it was my concentration. Tonight, even
though they were walks, they were different walks."</TE>
<TE>   On came Brown in the sixth. He began in rocky fashion, allowing
the first four men he faced to get aboard. Had it not been for an
aborted double steal, the Marlins could have had a big inning.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson opened with a single and Lee walked. With Encarnacion at
bat, the runners took off, but Lo Duca's throw cut down Wilson at
third.</TE>
<TE>   At least that was the opinion of third-base umpire Phil Cuzzi.
Wilson protested and a replay seemed to indicate that Beltre had
applied a late tag.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, however, was unable to take advantage of the call. He gave
up a single to Encarnacion and Lowell followed with a fly ball to
right that landed just inside the foul line and just beyond the grasp
of the oncoming Green, sending Lee home.</TE>
<TE>   With reliever Braden Looper on the mound and two out in the ninth,
the Dodgers finally answered the pleas of the crowd, which had been
pounding those kiddie bats all night, trying to stir a rally.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora's double scored two runs, but Looper got pinch-hitter
Tyler Houston on a bouncer back to the mound, silencing both the
Dodger bats and those incessant kiddie bats in the stands.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Roseboro Let His Game Do Talking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Dodger catcher John Roseboro was nicknamed "Gabby" because he
was anything but. Catching, not conversation, was his forte.</LD>
<LD>   But Tuesday at Dodger Stadium, the conversation in both dugouts
was about Roseboro, who died last Friday at 69.</LD>
<LD>   Florida Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg, who played with Roseboro,
marveled at his low-key demeanor.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd be celebrating a World Series win or a pennant win," Torborg
said. "Guys would be shaking up the champagne and Rosey would be in
the trainer's room having a Coke."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dodger vice-president Tom Lasorda, "I never heard him raise
his voice. He would never take credit for a win.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see all some people remember is the [Juan] Marichal
incident [when Roseboro was hit over the head with a bat by the San
Francisco Giant pitcher]. They forget the great years Roseboro had.
When you talk about blocking the plate, he was as good as anybody I'd
ever seen before [Mike] Scioscia got here. When Roseboro was here, we
had what I think was the best pitching staff this team ever had and
he handled it like a general."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro followed Hall of Famer Roy Campanella in 1958, but, said
announcer Vin Scully, because the Dodgers chose to go with older
players at the end of their careers, it was easier for Roseboro to
settle in behind the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "What pressure was there," Scully said, "in catching for a
seventh-place team?"</TE>
<TE>   Torborg, on the other hand, felt a good deal of pressure in
following Roseboro.</TE>
<TE>   "He might be one of the toughest guys I've ever seen," Torborg
said. "I once told him, 'Man, you are a tough act to follow. You get
hit by foul tip, you've got to let people know you are hurting.' But
he said, 'No, no, you don't let anybody know you're hurting.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was so strong and so special to me, I find it hard to believe
he's gone. I sit in this dugout and feel like crying."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marlin second baseman Luis Castillo was penciled in at the top of
the lineup but was scratched before the first pitch because of a sore
right hand. Homer Bush took his place.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   DODGERS' OMAR DAAL</TE>
<TE>   (10-8, 3.72 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   vs.</TE>
<TE>   MARLINS' MICHAEL TEJERA</TE>
<TE>   (8-5, 3.88)</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Stadium, 7</TE>
<TE>   TV--Fox Sports Net 2.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Update--With Kevin Brown in the Dodger bullpen looking for an
opening in the starting rotation, Daal is doing his best to make sure
his spot is secure. In his last five starts, Daal is 3-0 with a 1.89
ERA. In his last outing, Daal pitched seven innings of shutout ball
against the Montreal Expos, not allowing a runner past second base.
This is Tejera's fourth career road start. He has lost the other
three.</TE>

<LD>SPARKS vs. UTAH</LD>
<LD>   Game 1: Thursday, 7 p.m., ESPN2</LD>
<LD>   How they match up:</LD>
<TE>   Small forward: Mwadi Mabika (16.8 points, 5.2 rebounds) vs.
Adrienne Goodson (15.7, 5.7). Mabika had the breakout season some
have been predicting and was the league's sixth-best scorer. But she
also has not practiced this week after a left ankle sprain in
Saturday's playoff victory over Seattle. Goodson was 10th in scoring
and plays at a relentless pace that belies her age (35). Both players
are streak shooters who can take over a game.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Even.</TE>
<TE>   Power forward: Marlies Askamp (1.8, 1.8) vs. Natalie Williams
(11.3, 8.2). Askamp, who came to Los Angeles from Miami in a
midseason trade, moved into the starting lineup on Aug 9, and the
Sparks have won all five games she has played. Her biggest outing in
those five games was a 12-point, five-rebound effort against Utah.
Williams had a rather quiet regular season but is still one of the
league's strongest players and best rebounders.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Center: Lisa Leslie (16.9, 10.4) vs. Margo Dydek (13.1, 8.7).
Leslie's regular season wasn't quite as spectacular as her 2001 most
valuable player year. But she dominated Seattle in the playoffs,
averaging 23.5 points in the two games. Dydek is the league's tallest
player (7 foot 2) and a defensive wall on the inside, averaging 3.57
blocked shots. Dydek should be a better scoring threat, but she is
not quick and can have trouble getting her shot off when surrounded
defensively.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard: Tamecka Dixon (10.6, 4.0 assists) vs. Marie
Ferdinand (15.3, 2.8). Dixon, who often struggled in the regular
season, shooting 39.1% from the field, looked revitalized against
Seattle. Her ability to penetrate and her playoff experience are the
only edge against Ferdinand, a second-year player blossoming into one
of the league's best.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard: Nikki Teasley (6.4, 4.4) vs. Jennifer Azzi (9.6,
4.9). Azzi can be a deadly three-point shooter if left alone, but
these days has to get by more on experience than athleticism. Teasley
is the exact opposite, getting by on athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   The series: The Sparks swept the season series, 3-0, and have
defeated the Starzz seven of the last nine meetings. Utah, one of the
few teams willing to run with Los Angeles, will fight fatigue after
upsetting Houston on Tuesday night to reach the conference finals.
The Starzz can steal Game 1 here, as they did in the Houston series.
The Sparks need to have Leslie stay as hot as she was against
Seattle, and for Mabika to regain her 2002 All-Star form.</TE>
<TE>   Pick: Sparks in three.</TE>

<HD>Season Becomes Madcap Affair</HD>
<DH>It's tough to keep success from going to Gagne's headgear</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I stink.</LD>
<LD>   But Dodger closer Eric Gagne doesn't. And I'm the reason why.</LD>
<LD>   Let me introduce myself: I'm Eric's cap. Smelly, salt-stained, one
of a kind.</LD>
<TE>   His wife hates me. Alex Cora says I remind him of his college dorm
room--a complete disaster. The Dodger equipment manager? Won't go
near me without rubber gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when the cap breaks down I'll change it," Eric told a
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Nice loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Eric's already banked 43 saves, one short of Todd Worrell's team
record of 44. Bobby Thigpen's major league-record 57 is within reach.
Before I got onto his head he'd amassed zero.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I'm here. To set the record straight. Vin Scully
recites poetry about the transformation. But I made Eric Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tracy won't admit it. Neither will umpire Dan Iassogna, who
threw Eric out in the ninth inning in Cincinnati, allegedly for
hitting Adam Dunn after giving up a homer. But if you're a Dodger
fan, you better tip your cap to this one.Without me, Eric is toiling
for triple-A Vegas. Or sitting back home in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   I'm no head case. These are the facts: Last season, Eric was
sporting the same goofy goggles and hipster beard. He was sent to the
minors twice.</TE>
<TE>   I came out of the box in February. Eric hasn't been the same
since. A coincidence? No way! Unhittable stuff. Intimidating
presence. Media darling.</TE>
<TE>   That's what gets me.</TE>
<TE>   We go to the All-Star Game, but you didn't see me in Milwaukee.
The practice cap got all the glory.</TE>
<TE>   What? You didn't know? Eric mugs for TV interviews in Pretty Boy,
a phony stand-in.</TE>
<TE>   Same thing for autographs. The Canadian has gone Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   I'm jealous. It's no fun hanging with a bunch of jockstraps in
Eric's locker. I escape for an inning or two.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not ashamed to admit it: I feel used.</TE>
<TE>   Check out these battle scars. Torn four times. I remember every
one.</TE>
<TE>   The Rip of Arrival. San Francisco. Barry Bonds digging in. How big
is that guy's head? I can't contain the adrenaline. Two passed balls.
Bonds walks, but Eric gets the save. I have a future.</TE>
<TE>   The Rip of Failure. Atlanta. Gary Sheffield goes deep. With two
out in the bottom of the ninth! Blown save. I must be a goner.</TE>
<TE>   The Rip of Sorrow. Los Angeles. Eric's in tears. The Montreal
Canadiens were eliminated from the NHL playoffs. Gimme a break.</TE>
<TE>   The Rip of Redemption. St. Louis. Two days after a Diamondback
disaster. Bases loaded, no outs. A 1-2-3 double play and fly ball
secures 31st save. It's official: I'm carrying the guy.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, I'm not the first cap to save the Dodgers. I had a cousin. In
the spring of 1988, he belonged to Kirk Gibson. Jesse Orosco smeared
eye-black under the bill. It was a joke. But Gibson went psycho. And
the Dodgers went on to win the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   If Eric sticks with me, maybe we'll be playing in October. Heck,
we could be bound for Cooperstown.</TE>
<TE>   I'd look great in bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Gary Klein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Freeing Up Lalas Is the Best Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the Galaxy's 5-0 meltdown in the Meadowlands against the
MetroStars on June 15, Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid realized he had to
shake things up defensively and lean on a seasoned veteran.</LD>
<LD>   Having already given up 19 goals in 12 Major League Soccer games,
Schmid shifted the defense to more man marking, thus freeing defender
Alexi Lalas to roam as a sort of free safety in the back.</LD>
<LD>   In the 10 games since, the Galaxy has given up 11 goals, gone
6-3-1 and hopes its good defensive fortunes continue tonight at the
Rose Bowl against the Kansas City Wizards.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had a couple of blow-up games," Schmid said. "But overall
we've been good.... Since we changed to more of a match-up, giving
Alexi a freer role, our defense has actually been pretty consistent."</TE>
<TE>   With Lalas free to roam, the Galaxy has endured only two
multi-goal games. And Lalas didn't play in one of those, last week's
3-2 loss at Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no different than any other sport," Lalas said. "If you work
hard defensively, you create space for yourself. Obviously, we have
the players that have the ability to go forward and attack and be
dangerous but you can't be dangerous on the attack unless you have
the ball. And some of the best attacking and offense-minded teams in
the world have really incredible defenses....</TE>
<TE>   "A team like [World Cup champion] Brazil--and certainly we're not
the caliber of Brazil--but the reason they are so good offensively
is, they win the ball back so quickly on defense and don't give you a
chance to get set and don't give you a chance to have possession."</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, who has freedom to go forward, set a personal record for
points in a season with 10--three goals, four assists--after scoring
on a header in Saturday's 4-0 victory over Colorado. He had nine
points--four goals and an assist--in 1999 with Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Lalas struggled for playing time in his first season
with the Galaxy, playing in only 11 MLS games. But with the 2001
preseason trade of Robin Fraser to Colorado and Greg Vanney being
sold to Bastia of the French first division in the off-season, a
window of opportunity opened for Lalas.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me a while to get back into the swing of things " Lalas
said. "Last year I was in and out of the lineup and I contributed
when I needed to, but it's taken me through this year to really get
back and to feel, not only physically, but mentally that I have the
ability."</TE>

<HD>Not Baffert's Best but Likely Good Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though Bob Baffert isn't starting what is perceived to be the
best 2-year-old in his barn in today's $150,000 Best Pal Stakes,
chances are the trainer will win the Grade III race for a third
consecutive time.</LD>
<LD>   Vindication, a $2.15-million purchase a year ago and a 5
1/2-length winner in his debut July 27, scratched from the Best Pal
in favor of a race Thursday, so Baffert will have to make do with
Icecoldbeeratreds, Kafwain and Chief Planner this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Looking to follow Flame Thrower and Officer, Baffert's last two
winners in the stakes, Icecoldbeeratreds will be favored to remain
unbeaten in the third start of his career.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Mike Pegram, the son of In Excess has humbled
California-breds in his first two races, including a 3 1/2-length win
in the Graduation Stakes July 31 at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Icecoldbeeratreds is the one to catch in the Best Pal, which is
the major prep for the $250,000 Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 11, and he
may never look back as he stretches out to 6 1/2 furlongs. So far,
he's won at 4 1/2 and 5 1/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   If Icecoldbeeratreds can't stay the extra yardage, Kafwain could
save the day for the stable. The son of Cherokee Run was compromised
by a slow start when he was the beaten favorite in the Hollywood
Juvenile Championship but has trained exceptionally well since coming
to Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   A win by Chief Planner would be a surprise. The rest of the field
is Hell Cat, Outta Here, Gralley and Red Apache.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Del Mar is an interesting starter
allowance race at one mile on the turf. None of the eight entrants
have won on grass and four of the horses have never tried the lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Laffit Pincay Jr. He ranks second in the Del Mar
standings behind Patrick Valenzuela with 21 victories and won for the
1,000th time at the seaside track Monday, taking the sixth with
longshot Chapeau.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Robbie Davis. The rider won with only two of his first
50 mounts at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Vowel Play, Fantastic Groom
and Spend Spend Spend in the fifth, Madame Pietra and Wild Tickle in
the sixth, Icecoldbeeratreds and Kafwain in the seventh and Jade
Express and F'rilly Miss in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/51. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $24/$311.80. Total money bet: $410.</TE>

<HD>Talk Turns Tough as Each Side Digs In</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Padre owner says he's prepared to sit out a
season. Fehr memo accuses owners of attack on salary structure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The rancorous process of baseball labor talks moved into public view
Tuesday with San Diego Padre owner John Moores saying he was prepared
to sit out a season if the Major League Baseball Players Assn.
follows through on its Aug. 30 strike deadline and union head Don
Fehr accusing owners of attempting a "wholesale attack on the salary
structure" in memos to major leaguers and agents.</LD>
<LD>   While negotiators focused on the core hurdles of a payroll tax and
revenue sharing, Moores became the most recent owner to defy
Commissioner Bud Selig's $1-million gag order. He followed Texas
Ranger owner Tom Hicks, who has publicly preached for even stronger
cost containment than management has proposed, in echoing the
sentiment of hard-line owners prepared to pay a high price for
greater salary restraint in the next agreement.</LD>
<LD>   "The hawks are circling," said owner Jerry McMorris of the
Colorado Rockies.</LD>
<TE>   Yankee owner George Steinbrenner also recently violated the gag
order, and a high-ranking major league official said Selig is
expected to fine Moores, Hicks and Steinbrenner after reviewing their
actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The commissioner wasn't at all happy and plans to deal with all
three cases," the official said. "In fact, he expressed his
displeasure in a conversation with Moores [Tuesday]. The only thing
comments of that type do is create a lot of heartache for the
negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   "They do not reflect the universal thinking of owners or any
change in negotiating strategy. The goal is what it has always been.
We need to create a system reducing the competitive and revenue
disparities and to do it through a negotiated settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Moores said he did not understand the reaction to comments
published in Tuesday's editions of the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm saying is that we have to be prepared for a walkout,"
said Moores, who believes eight to 10 other owners were prepared to
have a similar reaction in the event of a walkout. "It's the players'
strike. We have to be prepared for however long it lasts. As I've
said many times, there are serious problems with the system and they
have to be resolved. We can't keep asking fans to pay higher ticket
prices, and we can't keep shutting our eyes to the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a meaningful deal, not just any deal, and I'm confident
the commissioner will not bring a deal to ownership that he doesn't
believe is in the best interest of the game. I'm confident he will
not offer us a deal that doesn't look a whole lot like the blue
ribbon committee's report. I have a lot of confidence in Selig. He's
been very clear about what's needed, and I'm 100% prepared to support
him. I think most owners feel the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Moores would not discuss the specifics of his Tuesday conversation
with Selig ("I call Bud a lot and he's probably the premier telephone
caller in the U.S.") and denied that he's part of any militant
clique, or has participated in any private conference calls between
that group and Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very critical of the way baseball handled the negotiations
in 1994," he said. "I told Bud there were too many cooks, that he
needed to centralize control and communication, that he needed to
keep his own counsel. I'm very pleased that he seems to have taken my
advice."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fehr accused owners of moving to "lower salaries" in
briefing union membership, reaffirming his position that management's
economic proposal is tantamount to a salary cap. "Simply put," one
memo read, "the clubs' proposed tax is designed to and would apply
enormous pressure to reduce payrolls."</TE>
<TE>   Contacted Tuesday night, Fehr reiterated the union wouldn't agree
to a system that turns back the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obligated to make reports to my constituents and that's what
I did," Fehr said of the memos. "As for the comments of Moores and
Tom Hicks, well, you'll have to judge them for yourself. It is what
it is."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, baseball's lead labor lawyer, responded that Fehr's
portrayal of the owners' tax and revenue sharing proposal as a salary
cap was "a baffling characterization."</TE>
<TE>   "I assume the memorandum was sent out in order to brief the
players and get them prepared to engage in a work stoppage," he said.
"If [Fehr] went out and said, 'Gee, I agree with Rob Manfred, this
really is a modest set of proposals,' they probably wouldn't be all
that hot about the idea of going on strike."</TE>
<TE>   Manfred continued to express disappointment that the union has
brought the sport to the verge of its ninth work stoppage in 30 years
after owners vowed not to lock out players through the World Series,
but he remained hopeful a deal could be completed to avert a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "If the owners really wanted a salary cap, they know how to
propose a salary cap, and they would have instructed me to do so,"
said Manfred, who declined to reveal specifics of the economic
proposal he made Tuesday to the union. "Instead, we approached this
negotiation with a modest set of proposals that alone or in
combination cannot be fairly characterized as a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are is a set of proposals designed to reduce revenue
disparity in the industry. A salary cap is an aggregate limitation on
what players can earn and an absolute limitation on what any team can
spend. Neither of those are in our proposal."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees are watching the process closely.</TE>
<TE>   Club executives have met with major league officials to express
concern that management's proposed increases in revenue sharing and
payroll tax would create an onerous burden on their industry-high
resources. The Yankees have also retained noted attorney David Boies
and are considering filing a lawsuit against baseball if they are
displeased about the amount of their obligation in the next
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In a memo Saturday sent to agents and players, Fehr wrote that
under the owners' tax and revenue sharing proposal, the Yankees would
give up $86.9 million, the New York Mets $35.8 million, the Boston
Red Sox $34.2 million and the Seattle Mariners $32.3 million. Those
projections are based on revenue figures from last season and payroll
figures from this season. Fehr said players had agreed to raise the
amount of money to be transferred in revenue sharing from $169
million to $235 million, and said owners are proposing $282 million
be transferred.</TE>
<TE>   Owners are also proposing that any club exceeding a $102-million
payroll threshold be taxed at 37.5% the first time, 42.5% the second
time, 47.5% the third time and 50% the fourth time. The union, hoping
to limit the restraints on spending, has proposed taxing the portions
of payrolls over $130 million and using a tax rate between 15% to
30%.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr said seven teams currently have 2002 payrolls above the
owners' threshold, with the Yankees at $171.2 million, followed by
Texas ($131.4 million), the Dodgers ($118.8 million), Boston ($114.8
million), the Mets ($112.9 million), Arizona ($112.1 million) and
Atlanta ($110.4 million). These figures include the average annual
values of players on 40-man rosters plus benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Just below the threshold, according to Fehr, are Seattle ($98
million), St. Louis ($96.3 million), San Francisco ($94.5 million),
the Chicago Cubs ($93.2 million) and Cleveland ($92.3 million).</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we have had a difficult last six, seven days,
including the setting of the strike date," Manfred said. "Having said
that, my goal remains to get an agreement before any days are lost
due to the union strike."</TE>

<LD>Although he plays for a team headed for its third consecutive
last-place finish, Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers is a leading
candidate for most valuable player in the American League.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if it's greater to kick it in when you're in a
playoff stretch or kick it in when your team is in last place at this
point of the season," Texas Manager Jerry Narron said. "He's the best
player in the game."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: Who holds the modern-day NASCAR record for finishing
consecutive Winston Cup races?</LD>
<TE>   The closers: Gary Sheffield of the Atlanta Braves, in USA Today
Baseball Weekly, rates Byung-Hyun Kim, Mariano Rivera, Trevor
Hoffman, Matt Morris and teammate John Smoltz as the five pitchers
he'd least like to hit against with a game on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield said of Smoltz, "Thank God he's on my side now."</TE>
<TE>   Another Keyshawn? When New York Jet rookie receiver Kory Bailey
arrived in camp, his car had a vanity license plate that read:
"THRW2ME."</TE>
<TE>   High flier: Sammy Sosa was so upset when two team charter flights
had in-flight problems that the Chicago Cub slugger began chartering
his own private jets, taking some teammates with him.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two strikes already," he said. "Three strikes, you're
out. If I'm going to die, I want to die my way."</TE>
<TE>   Easy winnings: Thieves used Jacqueline Boanson's stolen debit card
to place bets on two horse races in England. When the horses won,
Ladbrokes bookmakers paid the winnings--291 pounds, the equivalent of
$444--directly into her account.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the happiest victim of theft ever," the Cheltenham woman
testified in court after the thieves were apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   How big is big? Tom FitzGerald asks in the San Francisco
Chronicle, "Isn't using the term 'big toe' to describe Shaquille
O'Neal's upcoming foot surgery redundant?"</TE>
<TE>   Italian intellectual: After car owner-driver Adrian Fernandez was
injured in a CART race in Vancouver, he selected Max Papis as a
substitute driver for the next race.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pleased to join the team," the affable Italian driver said,
"but I am not an albatross waiting for someone to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Which leads to the question: When was the last time an athlete
used the word "albatross?"</TE>
<TE>   Bottom rung: Kent State games averaged only 6,595 spectators last
season, the lowest attendance among the 114 schools playing major
college football. The school, with 33,000 students, needs to average
more than 15,000 for the Mid-American Conference to retain its
Division I-A standing.</TE>
<TE>   When Athletic Director Laing Kennedy was asked what was needed to
boost attendance, he said, "That's easy--a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jeff Gordon, with 54 after finishing 19th in
Sunday's Pepsi 400 at Michigan International Speedway, breaking the
late Dale Earnhardt's record.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The oldest player in this week's U.S. Amateur golf
tournament in Detroit is Bob Clark, 55, of Murrieta. He earned his
spot by being the low amateur in the U.S. Senior tournament.</TE>

<HD>Cowboys' Ismail to Have Neck Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dallas Cowboy receiver Raghib Ismail will undergo neck surgery today
to repair damage from a collision with a teammate last week in
practice.</LD>
<LD>   Although he probably will be out for the season, doctors said he
should be able to continue his career.</LD>
<LD>   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday he wasn't planning on
immediately putting Ismail on injured reserve, which would end his
season, because he hadn't yet talked to the receiver.</LD>
<TE>   But Jones made it clear "we're not planning on him playing this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dan Cooper described the injury as a huge herniated disk. The
problem is made worse by the fact Ismail has a relatively small
spinal canal, although Cooper said it's not the same chronic
narrowing that contributed to the end of Michael Irvin's career.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail will have the disk removed and the two vertebra around it
fused together.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery will be done by Dr. Drew Dossett, who has performed
the same procedure on many pro athletes, including former Cowboy
fullback Daryl Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston's career continued after his operation and Cooper expects
Ismail to play again, too.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the surgery is successful and he heals, he could
return to football," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, 32, would have been playing his 10th season, fourth in
Dallas. His last two seasons were marred by injury, including a torn
knee ligament in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail was hurt last Wednesday when linebacker Dat Nguyen kneed
him while trying to avoid a collision.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail was down for a few minutes, then walked to the locker room
with trainers. He didn't return to practice and was held out of an
exhibition game Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Davis is still hoping for what he calls "a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Because of chronic knee injuries, the Denver Bronco running back
was put on the injured-reserve list, which ends his season and more
than likely signals the end of his career.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis insisted he was not retiring--not yet, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Denver owner Pat Bowlen said the festivities of the last
few days, including Davis' introduction in uniform before Monday
night's San Francisco-Denver game and his mile-high salute to the
fans, should not be construed as a retirement announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "As Mr. Bowlen said, this is not a retirement party," Davis said
Tuesday. "I'm going to do everything I can possibly do to see if I
can return to the field again."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged, however, that "barring a miracle, from what I'm
hearing, this is it."</TE>

<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker Kendrell Bell, the 2001 defensive
rookie of the year, will sit out the rest of the preseason because of
a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Bell damaged ligaments in the ankle during the Steelers'
exhibition game Sunday at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bell will wear a cast for about a week. He had the same injury
last season and returned to play three weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Dolphin defensive end David Bowens broke his hand in
practice and underwent surgery that will sideline him for about three
weeks.</TE>

<TE>   Fans attending Tampa Bay Buccaneer games will not be patted down
by security guards at stadium gates.</TE>
<TE>   Citing civil liberties issues and concerns over possible lawsuits,
the Tampa Sports Authority's board voted, 9-2, on Monday to reject a
request by the Buccaneers and the NFL that all game-day visitors to
Raymond James Stadium, including players, be frisked for weapons and
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight NFL teams plan to tighten security this season, the
sports authority said. Denver, New England, Philadelphia, Tennessee
and the New York Giants and Jets will frisk fans; Dallas and
Cleveland will screen them with metal-detecting wands.</TE>
<TE>   Frisking fans would cause long waits at stadium entrances, board
members said, and could leave the financially strapped agency open to
lawsuits from fans claiming they were touched inappropriately.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Beats Reds Despite Bullpen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Arizona bullpen cost Randy Johnson his 19th victory, but the
Diamondbacks regrouped to score twice without a hit in the eighth
inning and defeat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-3, Tuesday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Williams drove in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded
sacrifice fly against reliever Danny Graves, and another run scored
on David Dellucci's groundout.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona has won nine of 10, including four in a row over the Reds.
The Diamondbacks swept a three-game series at Cincinnati last week.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Fetters (3-0), one of three relievers Arizona used in the
eighth, got the victory. Byung-Hyun Kim pitched a scoreless ninth for
his 30th save, retiring Sean Casey with two on to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Kim matched Gregg Olson's team record for saves set in 1998,
Arizona's first season.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who had won his last five starts, settled down after a
wild start to strike out 12 in seven innings. He left with a 3-2
lead, but the Reds rallied in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. tied the score with a pinch-hit sacrifice fly
against Fetters with the bases loaded. Griffey was out of the
starting lineup because of a sore left hip flexor.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 1, New York 0--Jason Schmidt struck out the first
six batters he faced at San Francisco and finished a five-hitter by
striking out Mike Piazza with a runner on third base.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his most impressive performances since joining the
Giants late last season, Schmidt (8-6) tied a career high with 13
strikeouts and didn't allow a runner to reach second base until the
eighth inning. The shutout was the second of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds had two hits and scored on a throwing blunder in the
sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded, Tsuyoshi Shinjo hit a liner to short right
field that was caught by Jeromy Burnitz, and Bonds didn't try to tag
up from third.</TE>
<TE>   But Benito Santiago tagged up from second base and began running
toward third. When Bonds saw the Mets throw to get Santiago, he ran
home and beat the throw to Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   Al Leiter (10-10) was nearly as impressive as Schmidt, giving up
six hits and striking out eight in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Atlanta 2--Brett Tomko pitched a seven-hitter at San
Diego for his second complete game this season and Ron Gant had his
first two-homer game in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko (7-8) had been 0-2 with a 7.01 earned-run average against
Atlanta before the fourth complete game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 8, St. Louis 0--Kris Benson gave up one hit in seven
innings at St. Louis and the Pirates, who had lost six in a row to
the Cardinals, homered a season-best five times.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Giles, Craig Wilson, Adam Hyzdu, Aramis Ramirez and Rob
Mackowiak homered, and Jason Kendall had a three-run double.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Robinson got St. Louis' hit, a blooper to left-center field
in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, Montreal 6--Denny Neagle had his fourth consecutive
solid outing since rejoining the rotation, and Jay Payton hit a
three-run homer to lead the Rockies at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Neagle (7-7) went five innings, giving up seven hits and three
runs--two earned. Demoted to the bullpen for a month at midseason,
the left-hander is 3-0 with a 1.08 ERA in his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Neagle gave up a run in the third to end his consecutive scoreless
innings streak at 20, a record for a Rockie starter and third-best in
team history.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 2, Philadelphia 1--Jamey Wright pitched into the seventh
inning at Milwaukee to beat the Phillies for the first time in more
than five years.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Hernandez had a run-scoring single for Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Burrell hit his career-high 30th home run for the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 14, Houston 12--Corey Patterson tied a career high with
four hits and drove in three runs at Houston, where Chicago got 24
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Lance Berkman hit his 33rd homer and drove in five runs.
Jose Vizcaino had four hits and three runs batted in for the Astros,
who remained five games behind St. Louis in the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   The teams combined for 40 hits, an Astro record.</TE>

<HD>SHARK HAUNT</HD>
<DH>Guadalupe Island waters are popular spot to see great
whites</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUADALUPE ISLAND, Mexico</DL>
<LD>It was a classic ambush, a swift charge from the wavering depths, a
powerful bite to the neck, then a sprint out of sight.</LD>
<LD>   The sea lion had been lounging atop the surface, soaking up the
sun. It never saw the shark coming.</LD>
<LD>   Like the seals and sea lions that frolicked lazily around the
vessel, those aboard the Searcher had also been lulled into
complacency. There had been two uneventful days. Their bodies were
stretched out on the sprawling deck. Their eyes wandered. Their minds
were elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   But then, at 9:38 a.m., came the shout, "Shark! Great white shark!
It's a 15-footer at least!"</TE>
<TE>   Pandemonium suddenly reigned on the 95-foot vessel. Its passengers
sprang to life, scrambling to climb into their wetsuits. Graham
Atkinson of Toronto was the first to dive in, ahead of his father,
Bob. Karen Green of Millbrae, Calif., was next, followed by her
husband, Jeff. Then went Richard Brauer, a retired Air Force colonel
from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., and Sam Thompson of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what they all wondered, wide eyes glaring nervously through
masks, was whether the predator would return....</TE>
<TE>   The Guadalupe Mystique</TE>
<TE>   It took 20 hours over a wind-swept sea to get here to Guadalupe
Island, the boat traveling day and night, arriving in the gray light
of dawn with two large aluminum cages. Some handled the trip better
than others, but regardless of what kind of shape the 12 intrepid
divers were in, as they staggered from their bunks, wiping sleep from
their eyes, what they saw was something they'll never forget.</TE>
<TE>   Looming ominously off the bow was a colossal volcanic island with
steep and colorful shores teeming with seals and sea lions. Their
incessant roars, from the dark caves they lived in, sounded more like
those coming from dinosaurs or great apes.</TE>
<TE>   From the center of the island rose high rolling hills, some
to 4,000 feet, being washed over by fog that cascaded down their slopes
in what looked to be a perpetual avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   This was another world, to be sure. But it was the stunningly blue
world beyond the island's mysterious shores, the one immediately
beneath the vessel that had brought them here, that was of particular
interest to the passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere down there was the great white shark, a creature reputed
to have menaced schools of tuna that breeze through these waters; to
have terrorized the seals and sea lions; to have spilled human blood.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere down there was "Whitey" and those aboard the Searcher
had come specifically to look him squarely in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard about reef sharks in the Bahamas and smaller sharks
elsewhere in Mexico that you can dive with," said Bob Atkinson, here
with his 16-year-old son, Graham. "But if you're going to swim with
sharks, why not go for the ultimate?"</TE>
<TE>   'Sharkiest Place on Earth'</TE>
<TE>   This remote island--it's 220 miles southwest of San Diego and 160
miles west of Baja California--has long been a haunt for great
whites. In recent years, though, encounters between sharks and
fishermen have been steadily increasing, leading some to believe that
the number of sharks also is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   This has piqued the interest of at least one shark-diving
operation, whose president is predicting Guadalupe will become the
next great haven for divers wanting to swim with the world's most
notorious predator--Australia and South Africa being the others. It
has also caught the attention of scientists hoping to learn more
about an animal whose movements and habits remain very much a
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "Guadalupe is a major site for great white sharks, but it's only
recently being looked at," says Michael Domeier, president of the
Pfleger Institute of Environmental Research in Oceanside, Calif.
"I'll put it this way: There are enough sharks there that I won't go
in the water."</TE>
<TE>   Domeier's group has tagged 19 great whites over the last three
summers as part of a long-term project. The smallest was an
eight-footer, the biggest measuring 18 feet. The deepest one has
dived is 12,000 feet; the farthest one has traveled is more than
1,000 nautical miles, to an area in the mid-Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Domeier couldn't say for sure whether their numbers were
increasing at Guadalupe but cited several reasons for them to be
here: a growing number of Guadalupe fur seals, a species once thought
to be extinct; a seasonal presence of northern elephant seals and
California sea lions, and the same seasonal presence of very large
tuna.</TE>
<TE>   The tuna, mostly bluefin and yellowfin, for the last 40 years have
lured sportfishermen aboard San Diego-based long-range boats. The
Searcher is one such vessel. Its owner and primary captain, Art
Taylor, says the sharks have come to consider the fishing boats as
food sources, having learned that tuna on the hook are much easier to
catch than those swimming free.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw [a shark] last summer that was 20 feet long, right here,"
he said, pointing beside the boat, which he had anchored on the lee,
or east side of the island's north end. "It was almost to the point
where we had to leave because we weren't getting anything to the
boat. The shark was getting it all."</TE>
<TE>   This phenomenon is what led Lawrence Groth to add Guadalupe Island
and its gin-clear water to his menu. Groth is president of Golden
Gate Expeditions, which for three years has been taking divers to the
Farallon Islands off San Francisco, with limited success in
perpetually murky water.</TE>
<TE>   During Groth's first voyage here last September, aboard the San
Diego dive-boat Horizon, Whitey came through spectacularly.</TE>
<TE>   For three consecutive days the passengers, breathing air piped
from above, had close encounters with sharks as large as 15 feet,
attracted by Groth's continual "chumming" of beef blood, tuna oil and
fish byproducts. There were up to four sharks around the cages at a
given time. All were cautious but methodical in their approaches.
None attacked the cages.</TE>
<TE>   Groth returned, claiming to have discovered "the sharkiest place
on earth." He struck a deal with Taylor to run a series of trips this
summer and fall, and has similar plans for next season.</TE>
<TE>   As the chumming began on the first morning of one of his
most recent trips, Groth made only one request of his customers: "If
you're lying down in the cage, which a lot of divers like to do while
they shoot pictures, remember to bend your knees because the cage is
only five feet across. Otherwise, if you're taller than five feet,
you'll have your legs and feet hanging out, and we wouldn't want
that."</TE>
<TE>   A Fatal Attraction</TE>
<TE>   The new wave of shark divers can bask in the security of sturdy
aluminum cages, with bars wide enough for fish and perhaps even small
sharks to swim through, but narrow enough to keep the larger and
potentially deadlier predators out.</TE>
<TE>   They have floats on top to keep them at the surface and struts
attached to the vessel's stern. The divers, wearing wet suits and
weight belts, need only step carefully across a short horizontal
ladder and plop into the cages. Each then is handed a regulator
attached to a rubber hose, which in turn is attached to a topside
compressor. They dive hookah-style, with no bulky tanks on their
backs. Scuba certification, although advised, is not mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   But there are those who scoff at such an operation. They are the
breath-hold, or free-diving spear-fishermen, who have been coming
here as long as the fishermen have, though in far smaller numbers.
These are the purists, the "blue-water hunters" who purposely place
themselves in the food chain as they seek record-sized tuna and
yellowtail known to frequent Guadalupe's shores.</TE>
<TE>   The first serious incident occurred in 1973. That September, late
in the afternoon, as revered free-diver Albert Schneppershoff was in
the water alone, a shark struck unsuspectingly, biting deeply into
one of his legs.</TE>
<TE>   He surfaced, yelling, "Shark!" His 9-year-old son, who had been
watching from the bow of the yacht, ran into the cabin to get help,
and soon the captain was backing toward the diver. Schneppershoff
managed only one more word, "Tourniquet!" The shark had severed an
artery in his leg and he had bled so profusely while in the water
that virtually no blood was left in his body when he was pulled
aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Schneppershoff was one of the most respected free-divers of his
time.</TE>
<TE>   "When we lost him, it struck at the very heart of our sport,"
recalled Skip Hellen, a prominent San Diego free-diver.</TE>
<TE>   Schneppershoff's son, also named Al, doesn't remember much about
the solemn ride back to San Diego. Today, at 38, he's an accomplished
free-diver, proud to be following in his father's wake. But he has no
desire to return to Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   The next incident, 11 years later, involved Schneppershoff's
longtime friend, Harry Ingram. Ingram was fortunate to see the shark
charging. He pointed his gun and pulled the trigger on impact. The
shark plowed into the tip of the gun, driving its butt into Ingram's
shoulder and launching him clear of the water. Help came fast and
Ingram suffered only a bruised shoulder. He has not been back either.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the only two verified reports of white shark attacks on
humans at Guadalupe Island. But locals--there's a small Mexican navy
garrison and a seasonal fish camp--have told stories about an abalone
diver who went down but never surfaced; of a skiff that went out with
two fishermen and was later found adrift, minus the fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Such yarns don't sit well with Searcher deckhand Joe Fernandes,
the newest crew member and thus the one who has to do the dirty work.
On a trip earlier this season, "They made me take the skiff and tow a
seal decoy around in the middle of the chum slick," he said, shaking
his head. "Man, I felt like I was the decoy. I'm never going to do
that again."</TE>
<TE>   A Fleeting Glimpse</TE>
<TE>   Dive operators offer no guarantees anywhere white sharks are
targeted, even at Guadalupe Island, which has long been considered a
feast-or-famine destination by fishermen and free-divers, and will
probably turn out to be one for shark divers as well.</TE>
<TE>   All aboard the Searcher were aware of this--"It's the nature of
the beast," Brauer said--and they leveled no criticism toward Groth
or Taylor and their crews as Days 1 and 2 produced no sharks of any
species, despite an oily chum slick that spanned several miles behind
the stern, looking like a highway sure to bring in at least one
curious predator.</TE>
<TE>   In the distance on both days, schools of tuna could be
seen leaping after baitfish and beaked whales could be seen shooting
plumes high into the sky. Elephant seals lined their favorite
beaches, their blubbery faces pointed toward the sea. Fur seals and
sea lions were the boldest of the pinnipeds, floating on their backs
and bellies, shooting only casual glances downward.</TE>
<TE>   The island itself, though it was so alive, and with its colorful
layers of rock sculpted so magnificently over the years by the forces
of nature, seemed so alone. The only visible buildings were those of
an old abandoned prison on the northeastern shore. Vegetation was
sparse, having been gobbled up by goats that have overrun the island
since the species was introduced more than 150 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   What few people there were on the other side of the island had not
made their presence known. The divers and the crews, which had wined
and dined together during two beautiful evenings aboard the Searcher,
had only each other and their pinniped friends for company.</TE>
<TE>   The thought of sharks, by the time the third and final morning
rolled around, had all but faded away.</TE>
<TE>   The cages, though still submerged, remained vacant long after
breakfast. The divers had taken up fishing, but not even the fish
were cooperating.</TE>
<TE>   Co-captain Kevin Ward, standing by a large barrel of chum, had
become preoccupied with the closest sea lion, one that seemed all too
comfortable as it rolled around before the salty old skipper.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just sitting here thinking, 'I'd like to see a shark come
up and eat your [butt] right now,' " he would say later.</TE>
<TE>   He got his wish, but the shark's hit was not a telling one.</TE>
<TE>   After the strike, it abandoned its prey and raced mightily behind
the boat and along the starboard rail.</TE>
<TE>   That was the last the divers would see of Whitey. From the cages,
all they could make out was a single sea lion, sticking purposefully
close to the boat, fright in its eyes and a freshly torn gash on its
neck.</TE>

<LD>When I read the USA Today headline the other day: "Reporter's risque
poses raise questions," I looked quickly, of course, to see if there
was any mention of Adande, Plaschke or Pucin. You have to admit, each
one of them is not opposed to flashing a little talent once in a
while, if you know what I mean.</LD>
<LD>   But right away the story began, "Jill Arrington, previously
criticized for wearing skimpy outfits as a college football sideline
reporter on CBS, has taken it to a new level with a sexually oriented
magazine photo layout."</LD>
<LD>   Everyone knows you can't believe everything you read in the
newspaper, so I had to see for myself if she's taken it to a new
level. I took the company credit card, purchased the sexually
oriented magazine and spent the evening studying Arrington's photo
layout.</LD>
<TE>   I have to tell you--my daughters dress more risque on occasions,
so you can imagine my disappointment. I've even tried to scare my
daughters: "You keep dressing like that, girls, and some day you're
going to grow up and work for Fox."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WERE three pictures of Arrington in something called, "FHM,"
which also featured six provocative photos of Anna Kournikova looking
like the best tennis player I've ever seen. In striking contrast,
Arrington appeared like a young woman about to take in a Dodger game,
sunning herself in the left-field pavilion. And yet USA Today TV
columnist Rudy Martzke and ESPN's Robin Roberts carried on like Gypsy
Rose Lee was going to be walking the CBS sidelines this season.</TE>
<TE>   They said a journalist should not act like that, which was news to
me. I had no idea CBS had hired a journalist when they went looking
for a sideline reporter. I had been under the impression the rule of
thumb for most TV networks was to hire a real babe to catch the fancy
of fans and players alike.</TE>
<TE>   I can't say for a fact NBC or CBS or ABC hasn't made a run at
Barbara Walters or Greta Van Susteren to work the sideline, but
looking at every one of their sideline reporters they all seem to
have the same credentials: Good looks. In fact I fear one day we're
going to hear about a solid journalist caught flat-footed and
trampled by athletes trying to make themselves available for Lisa
Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   I imagine the networks would like to find a good-looking
journalist. But like Barker's Beauties on "The Price is Right," the
first order of business is to hire someone who can just point to the
"Refrigerator" and smile. And that's fine.</TE>
<TE>   I can't remember the last memorable thing said by player or coach
to anyone holding a microphone on the sideline, so why waste a good
journalist when we can put a real babe to work? You want to see more
of Jim Gray or Melissa Stark?</TE>
<TE>   Now if these young women feel the need to certify themselves as
real (sports) babes by appearing in sexually oriented magazines every
so often, then I can write the magazines off as business expenses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS told there was another sexually oriented magazine featuring
a photo layout of Fox's female sports broadcasters. There was no
mention, however, of the women's names on the cover of any of the 13
or 14 sexually oriented magazines I bought with the company credit
card. But when I got to "Maxim," and read the cover teases: "Unleash
Her Inner Nympho," and "Super Bowl Winner Revealed," I felt I was
getting real warm.</TE>
<TE>   I found Guerrero on page 162 looking right back at me, like she
really couldn't wait to give me her Super Bowl pick, and I guess in
her excitement she forgot to put the rest of her clothes on. I also
came across Fox's Sunday NFL ornament, Jill Barberie, obviously down
on her luck, because there were holes everywhere in her pants, and
further revealing shots of Fox's Leeann Tweeden and Rebecca Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the four women, it was clear to me that Fox doesn't
provide much of a clothing allowance for its female broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HAVEN'T even mentioned Lisa Dergen, a former Playboy centerfold,
who reports on golf for Fox. I ran into her recently, and she was
telling me how she likes to play golf with Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure Tiger is real impressed with her work as a journalist,
which makes me wonder what he thinks of Thomas Bonk and Mike James,
who have covered golf for The Times, but never played golf with him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOM LASORDA introduced me to a friend of his, Sister Theresa Reis,
before Tuesday's Dodger game. I told Lasorda it'd be a miracle if I
could get the good sister's name in the same column with Guerrero and
her half-dressed friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be reading," Sister Theresa said. I'd guess, not by this
point, though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA IS going to remove the media from courtside this basketball
season, and sell those 44 seats for $10,000 each to season-ticket
holders. This is different from USC's policy of charging $10,000 for
the chance to interview AD Mike Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Newhall Signal female reporter with no sports background raised
the ire of the Dodgers after writing about her experiences of
covering a game and meeting Shawn Green in the clubhouse fresh out of
the shower. Green asked what I thought of her story, and I said I
blamed the woman's editors for not exercising better judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "So you must have the same editors then," Green said with a smirk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Mike Karger:</TE>
<TE>   "I sure hope your neighbors Tom &amp; Aida follow the law by
disclosing all known defects to potential buyers by informing them
you live nearby."</TE>
<TE>   Let me just say--this probably isn't a good time to be a USC fan,
and looking to buy a new home in Orange County.</TE>

<HD>Italians Delay Start of Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Italian soccer league took the unprecedented step Tuesday of
postponing the start of its 2002-2003 season by two weeks because not
all of its clubs have reached agreement on television coverage of
their games.</LD>
<LD>   The season, which was to have started Sept. 1, will now begin
Sept. 15, assuming there is no additional delay.</LD>
<LD>   Larger and more successful clubs such as Juventus, AS Roma and AC
Milan have signed lucrative television contracts, but eight of the
less-popular clubs in Serie A--Atalanta, Brescia, Chievo, Como,
Empoli, Modena, Perugia and Piacenza--have not.</LD>
<TE>   The smaller clubs are each asking for $9.84 million for the rights
to live coverage of their home games, but the pay-per-view television
companies are offering less than half that.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting in Milan, league members agreed unanimously to delay
the start of the season in the hope that a compromise could be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Adriano Galliani, the league's president and a vice president of
AC Milan, said the big clubs had made the decision "to give strong
political support to the teams in Serie A and Serie B" still seeking
television contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a good day for Italian football because we have taken
this decision in total unanimity and shown great unity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one round of Serie A games will be affected by the delay
because the league's first division is dark in the second week while
Italy plays a Euro 2004 qualifying match against Azerbaijan.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal Dollar Debate</TE>
<TE>   Portugal's government is committed to paying its share of the $541
million it will cost to build or renovate the 10 stadiums that will
play host to the European Championship in 2004, a spokeswoman for
Prime Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso said.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper reports had suggested that the government, beset by a
sizable budget deficit, would reduce its 25% contribution to the cost
of staging the quadrennial 16-nation tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Diario Economico reported that the country's finance minister,
Ferreira Leite, and its defense minister, Paulo Portas, had
recommended cutbacks in the government's support of Euro 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Portuguese soccer federation and league officials, however, are
seeking an increase in government funding for the event, second only
to the World Cup in scope and popularity.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. to Play Mexico</TE>
<TE>   The defending world champion United States women's national team
has learned who its opponents will be in the Oct. 27-Nov. 9 CONACACAF
Women's Gold Cup, which will also serve as qualifying for the fourth
FIFA Women's World Cup in China next year.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will play Mexico at the Rose Bowl on Oct. 27; Trinidad
and Tobago at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium on Oct. 29, and
Panama at SAFECO Field in Seattle on Nov. 2 in Group A.</TE>
<TE>   Group B will consist of Canada, Costa Rica, Jamaica and either
Haiti or Suriname, and will play its games in Victoria, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The semifinals will be played in Seattle on Nov. 6 and the
third-place game and final will be at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 9.</TE>
<TE>   New Coaches in Africa</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying for the 2004 African Nations Cup in Tunisia begins next
month and several African countries are lining up new coaches for the
event.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Madagascar said it would sign Hans Heiniger, 61, of
Switzerland, as its coach. Sudan earlier had selected former Poland's
national team coach, Wojciech Lazarak, to lead its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nigeria's new coach, Christian Chukwu, is touring
Europe, assessing Nigerian players at clubs in England, France and
Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Raul to Lead Spain</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Coach Inaki Saez has appointed Real Madrid striker Raul as
the national team's new captain in place of retired defender Fernando
Hierro.</TE>
<TE>   "He has played more internationals than anyone else in the side
and, apart from his charisma and quality, he is the archetypal
professional who is always trying to improve, score more goals and
push himself to the limit," Saez said.</TE>
<TE>   Raul, 25, who has scored 28 goals in 55 games for Spain, will lead
the team against Hungary in Budapest today in Saez's first game as
national coach.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, France's Coach Jacques Santini, who will make his own
debut against Tunisia in Tunis today, confirmed that Chelsea defender
Marcel Desailly would continue as captain.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that he has the backing of the coach and staff as well
as a majority of the players with whom he has shared some difficult
moments," Santini said.</TE>
<TE>   German Coach Rudi Voeller named defensive midfielder Jens Jeremies
honorary captain for today's game against Bulgaria in Sofia because
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who is the captain, has been sidelined by a
knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Jens is the most-capped player in the squad and this is also a
way to thank him for his behavior and performances at the World Cup,"
Voeller said.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt Blanks Uganda</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Ahmed Belal in the second and 30th minutes earned Egypt a
2-0 victory over Uganda in front of 20,000 fans in Cairo on Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Let Them Eat Cake</TE>
<TE>   Brazil will celebrate its World Cup victory with a game against
Paraguay in Fortaleza, Brazil, today that is intended as a farewell
party for Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. However, Paraguay's Coach Anibal
Ruiz said that he has something else in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been invited to the party and we intend to eat most of the
cake," Ruiz said.</TE>

second-round match at the TD Waterhouse Cup on Tuesday night at
Commack, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras has not won a tournament since Wimbledon in 2000, the last

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Weber is a popular coach whose word is normally gospel to the
UCLA offensive linemen under his direction.</LD>
<LD>   They know he played guard at Cal Lutheran in 1977-78, won honors
as a small-college All-American and played for the National Assn. of
Intercollegiate Athletics national championship. That much is in the
UCLA media guide.</LD>
<LD>   But the Bruins didn't know until beginning training camp at the
Thousand Oaks campus this week that as a player Weber single-handedly
pushed a blocking sled off the practice field and about a half mile
up a steep, winding dirt road to where a large cross stands at the
top of a hill.</LD>
<TE>   That's the Cal Lutheran legend, anyway, Weber told them, the
twinkle in his eye concealed by dark sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   So Tuesday afternoon some of the players took a jog up the hill to
see for themselves. Sure enough, a blocking sled was there.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, it was in pristine condition. No rust. No evidence of
having sat there for nearly 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, only adds to the legend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus sat out most of practice with a sore right
(throwing) arm, one of several minor injuries that sidelined players.
Paus, who also has a cut on his rib cage under his right arm, is
expected to practice today.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman suffered a slight concussion diving for a
pass Monday and did not practice.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman's absence was noticeable because he has dominated
seven-on-seven drills, making outstanding catches each day.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Craig Bragg has a slightly pulled hamstring and freshman
defensive lineman C.J. Niusulu has a hip flexor.</TE>
<TE>   Center Mike McCloskey, who is fighting Paul Mociler for the
starting job, returned after missing three practices with flu.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo appointed Justin London as the freshman
representative to the Bruin advisory council.</TE>
<TE>   London joins Paus, Seidman, Manuel White, Mike Saffer, Ryan Smith,
Rusty Williams, Marcus Reese and Ricky Manning Jr. on the council,
which Toledo created this fall to enable respected players to keep
tabs on the team's off-the-field behavior.</TE>
<TE>   London, a middle linebacker from Roanoke, Va., has been among the
most impressive of the 33 freshmen, but he was tabbed for the council
because of his personality.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to play right away, yes, but he was chosen for his
leadership," Toledo said. "He is very gregarious and charismatic."</TE>
<TE>   That much was evident when London announced his college decision
in Roanoke in January, walking into a news conference wearing a
Virginia Tech cap and T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   He peeled off the shirt to reveal a UCLA shirt and announced he
was going to Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins begin full contact today with practices at 9:40 a.m.
and 4 p.m. that are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   No one is more eager to begin hitting than senior middle
linebacker Marcus Reese, who must replace Robert Thomas, an
All-American last season and first-round pick of the St. Louis Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of headaches," he said. "We'll see who is
tough enough.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I've been waiting for."</TE>

<HD>Arbet's Season Comes to End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Arbet, a first-team All-Pacific 10 Conference special teams
player who was scheduled to start at cornerback, will miss the season
because of a fractured bone in his right foot, USC learned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Arbet was slated to play left cornerback and return and cover
punts and kickoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "That is a big loss for us," USC Coach Pete Carroll said. "He was
the best player in the conference on special teams."</LD>
<TE>   Arbet wore a boot-type support that wrapped his right leg from
foot to knee. He said he was bothered by pain in spring practice and
throughout fall training camp but could not identify the source
because, "it was moving around."</TE>
<TE>   Arbet underwent a bone scan Monday and did not participate in the
Trojans' scrimmage at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Arbet said he will redshirt but did not know if surgery would be
required.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hit me, but it hasn't hit me like it will when we play our
first game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Justin Wyatt worked with the first-unit defense and will
get a look at returning punts. However, junior college transfer
Ronald Nunn is expected to take Arbet's position in the secondary
when he returns from a hamstring injury, which could be in the next
day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Darrell Rideaux is the starting right cornerback, but
Carroll said the mix could change as the Trojans move toward their
Sept. 2 opener against Auburn at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond, hospitalized for five days
because of a staph infection, was at practice, but he is not expected
to participate in drills until later this week. Carroll said that
redshirt freshman John Walker also will begin taking repetitions at
cornerback after working at safety during camp.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need Marcell to get back out there," Carroll said. "I
still think we have good players. We just don't have any experience."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver D. Hale was fitted with a protective boot on his left
foot and is scheduled to meet with a specialist to review an MRI
exam. Hale, Arbet and injured guard Zach Wilson are wearing boots.
"It's like a fashion trend," Hale said. "If you don't have a boot you
have a hamstring. Boots and hamstrings are the story of USC
football." ... Freshman tackle Winston Justice sat out afternoon
practice because of a sore neck.... Junior linebacker Chris Prosser
was moved from linebacker to defensive line.... Safety Troy Polamalu,
who suffered a mild concussion Thursday, returned to contact drills
and made a diving interception in the end zone on a short pass
play.... Linebacker Lofa Tatupu, son of former USC fullback Mosi
Tatupu, worked out for the first time since transferring from Maine
where he played last season as a freshman. Tatupu will redshirt this
season.... Redshirt quarterback Brandon Hance, a transfer from Purdue
who played at Woodland Hills Taft High, chatted up Taft seniors Steve
Smith and Noah Smith during the morning practice. Steve Smith is a
wide receiver and cornerback and is regarded as one of the top
recruits in the nation. Noah Smith is a receiver and also a top
sprinter.</TE>

<LD>Natalie Williams scored a career-high 25 points as the Utah Starzz
eliminated the Houston Comets from the WNBA playoffs with a 75-72
victory Tuesday night in a game delayed when referee Bill Stokes
collapsed early in the second half at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Play was stopped for 25 minutes when Stokes collapsed near the
scorer's table during a timeout with 15:33 left in the game. Stokes
was treated immediately by medical officials from both teams.</LD>
<LD>   He was taken to a Southwest Memorial Hospital where team officials
said he was listed in critical but stable condition. WNBA President
Val Ackerman left the game and joined Stokes at the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "At that time he was stable and breathing on his own," Comet Coach
Van Chancellor said. "Sure, I think the league is going to get
criticized [for resuming the game], but I didn't see any other
solution. It was just a tough loss any way you slice it."</TE>
<TE>   The Comets led, 43-40, when Stokes collapsed. When play resumed
with only two referees, the Starzz went on an 19-10 run and never
trailed again.</TE>
<TE>   The Starzz will play for the Western Conference championship
against the defending WNBA champion Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Sheryl Swoopes, who led Houston with 28 points, missed a long
three-point attempt at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty difficult," Swoopes said. "The hardest part is
staying focused and getting back out there and getting in the game
but we can't make excuses, because Utah kept their concentration and
composure. It could have easily been any one of us."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Swoopes beat out the Sparks' Lisa Leslie for selection
as the WNBA's most valuable player, winning the award for the second
time in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes, on Sunday, also won the league's award for best defensive
player.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Fever rookie Tamika Catchings was third in the voting,
conducted by 60 members of the media.</TE>
<TE>   New York 75, Indiana 60--Vickie Johnson scored 19 points to lead
the Liberty into the Eastern Conference finals before 12,471 at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty will face the Washington Mystics at the MCI Center on
Thursday in the best-of-three series.</TE>
<TE>   Nikki McCray led Indiana with 14 points. Rookie of the year
Catchings, who fell hard on her right hand and left the game for
X-rays in the first half, had 12 points on four-for-12 shooting.</TE>

<HD>Growers Voice Medfly Concerns at Hearing</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Farm leaders warn that new restrictions on
imports of a Spanish citrus may not be enough to protect against an
infestation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans to lift a federal ban on imports of Spanish clementines do not
contain adequate safeguards to protect California crops from another
outbreak of the devastating Mediterranean fruit fly, industry leaders
and local growers warned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Our history of fighting the medfly in California shows that the
threats are real and the costs can be tremendous," testified Bill
Pauli, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation, the
state's largest farm organization, with more than 95,000 member
families.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not about blocking foreign products from entering the
U.S." Pauli said. "It's about science over politics."</LD>
<TE>   Pauli's comments echoed those of about a dozen farm leaders who
spoke Tuesday in Oxnard, at the first of two U.S. Department of
Agriculture public hearings this week. The second is scheduled
Thursday in Lake Alfred, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a Department of Agriculture proposal to allow Spain to
resume exportation to the U.S. of clementines--a seedless,
easy-to-peel citrus, similar in shape and size to the tangerine.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators in December halted Spanish imports of the
seasonal fruit. The action was taken following the discovery of
clementines infested with live medfly larvae in shipments sent to
several states, including California.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service are proposing to resume the trade program, but with a host of
new restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   These include requiring medfly trapping six weeks in advance of
shipments, strengthening port-of-entry inspections and imposing a
two-day extension on the amount of time that clementines must be kept
in cold storage en route from Spain to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Sustained cold temperatures kill medfly larvae living in the pulp
of the fruit, according to Department of Agriculture officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel with all of these additional measures, the system
approach should give us the needed security," said Paul Gadh, an
import specialist with the Agriculture Department.</TE>
<TE>   But agriculture industry leaders say there is no evidence to prove
that two extra days in cold storage--at temperatures between 32 and
36 degrees--is enough to ensure that no live medfly larvae enter the
country.</TE>
<TE>   And anything less is unacceptable, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mediterranean fruit fly is to the fresh fruit industry what
hoof-and-mouth disease is to the livestock industry. It is potential
devastation," said Al Williams, chairman of the board for Sunkist
Growers, a marketing cooperative of more than 6,000 citrus growers in
California and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing buttons depicting a medfly covered with a red circle and
slash, growers Tuesday argued that the new rule was hastily devised,
based on a political desire to resume trade with Spain rather than
protect California's $27-billion agriculture industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Spain is one of our best cooperators in the war against
terrorism, and the U.S. government is eager to reward them for that,"
Santa Paula grower Richard Pidduck said outside the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The medfly, considered one of the most threatening agriculture
pests worldwide, attacks more than 250 types of fruits, vegetables
and nuts, many grown in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly smaller than a common housefly, the adult female medfly
lays eggs inside fruit by piercing its soft skin. The eggs hatch into
maggots, which feed inside the fruit pulp. The insect's life cycle is
between 21 and 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   California has battled more than a dozen medfly outbreaks since
1975, including a $100-million campaign in the early 1980s in the
Santa Clara Valley. Growers said a widespread outbreak could lead to
higher consumer prices, lost jobs, trade embargoes and reduced crop
yields.</TE>
<TE>   John Grether, who grows citrus and avocados in Las Posas Valley
near Somis, remembers the Ventura County medfly outbreak of 1994.
That eradication effort, which included a 16-mile quarantine, lasted
10 months and cost the local industry millions of dollars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was disruptive, it was expensive and it was frightening,"
Grether said outside the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "That is history we don't want to repeat."</TE>

<HD>Burbank Airport Expansion to Begin Despite Questions About
Its Legality</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The work, to start today, must be done to meet
federal safety rules, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the legality of Burbank Airport's expansion plans still under a
cloud, its governing board forged ahead Tuesday with plans to start
demolition work as early as today in order to meet a federal deadline
for upgrading security.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, construction workers will begin sawing through concrete
to remove a canopy over the outside baggage claim area on the runway
side of the airport, in preparation for the pouring of a new
foundation and construction of a temporary baggage conveyor, the
project's general contractor said. The airport plans to begin the
work without obtaining city building permits.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which will add 40,000 square feet of space to the
173,000-square-foot main terminal building, is necessary because of a
mandate by the federal Transportation Security Administration that
gives airports until the end of the year to upgrade baggage-check
security, airport officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The clock is ticking," said Victor Gill, spokesman for the
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion of the 1930s-era main terminal has long been a thorny
issue in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1980, airport officials have been planning to build a new
terminal on adjacent land. The most recent plans called for a 14-gate
replacement terminal of between 250,000 and 330,000 square feet that
would have included expanded passenger areas, retail and other
amenities as well as additional space for airport operations.</TE>
<TE>   The airport, which handled 4.5 million passengers last year, spent
$86 million to acquire a 131-acre parcel formerly owned by Lockheed
Martin as the site for a new terminal.</TE>
<TE>   But the project got tied up in court and then was opposed by local
residents, the airlines and, ultimately, the Federal Aviation
Administration. As a result, the airport's governing board decided to
sell the property. Twenty-two acres are currently in escrow.</TE>
<TE>   The airport authority still hopes to find a new site for a
replacement terminal but suspended the search after the Sept. 11
attacks, Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the airport's latest expansion plans are threatening to
go to court to stop the construction that they say violates city law.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the pretext of security, they're trying to get in an
airport expansion," said Howard Rothenbach, chairman of the Restore
Our Airport Rights committee, which campaigned for the successful
Measure A last year. The voter-approved initiative prohibits the
issuance of building permits for any new airport expansion or
modification until the airport imposes a 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew and
caps growth of the number of passengers at 10% over the current
level.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the legality of Measure A is scheduled for Friday in
Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Rothenbach said his group believes the expansion exceeds security
needs and will seek an injunction to halt construction.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Kirsch, special counsel to Burbank on airport issues, said
that the airport's governing board may be rushing unnecessarily.</TE>
<TE>   "The city and the [federal officials] believe that the project
should move forward quickly. However, it need not violate city
building codes to do so," Kirsch said. "It would be so outrageous for
a government agency to violate the law."</TE>
<TE>   He added that violators may be subject to fines as well as legal
action for breaking local planning and zoning ordinances by failing
to obtain the necessary permits.</TE>
<TE>   The general contractor for the project, for one, said he's not too
worried about violating city laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, our first desire is to work within laws, local and
federal," said Gary Hopkins, president of George C. Hopkins
Construction Co. of Glendale. But he said he believes that in this
case, the federal mandate--especially when motivated by security
concerns--supersedes local land-use law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a job that can be done without the city's blessing,"
Hopkins said. "The city of Burbank, I can't imagine that they would
send their police out to stop the construction."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the imminent expansion, the Burbank City Council
approved an emergency ordinance Tuesday night that would exempt
security-related construction from city laws prohibiting airport
expansion--but only if a judge declares Measure A invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ordinance, council members expressed skepticism about
the airport's motives in its urgent push to begin construction. "I
don't think all of this is for security measures, and I have some
problems with it," said Burbank Vice Mayor Stacey Murphy.</TE>

<HD>Bail Fraud Leads to Change in Jail Policy</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: The switch comes after a county inmate is
freed through use of fake cashier's checks.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a reputed gang member was bailed out of Orange County Jail
through the use of bogus cashier's checks, jail officials have
decided they'll no longer accept such checks for posting bond unless
a bank guarantees the funds.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the incident, jailers will accept only cash payments or
cashier's checks during routine banking hours so the funds can be
verified, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Dominic Peter Rizzo, 33, was being held on attempted murder
charges when a friend paid his $500,000 bail July 17.</LD>
<TE>   The unidentified man, who gave the jailer a fake name, said he was
a friend of Rizzo's and presented two $250,000 checks to the jailer.</TE>
<TE>   "The checks appeared to be good, and by law we have to take
certain tenders," Amormino said. "No banks were open at the time for
us to verify the funds."</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen days later, officers discovered the checks were phony and
ordered a warrant for Rizzo's rearrest.</TE>
<TE>   If captured, Rizzo will be held on $2 million bail and could face
charges of forgery or conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Rizzo is a member of a prison skinhead gang with a
reputation for counterfeiting and identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   Rizzo was arrested in 1999 for allegedly participating in the
stabbing of a man who police said was his friend and the godfather of
his child. Authorities contend the stabbing was ordered by leaders of
the prison-based gang.</TE>

<HD>Supersize That Education for You?</HD>
<DH>Schools: Its hugeness gives L.A. Unified financial
advantages and a vast bureaucracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is really, really, really
big.</LD>
<LD>   So big that when its books were off by 5%, as they were this
month, it discovered it had an extra $228 million on hand. So big
that when its students' answer sheets were turned in late, the entire
state had to delay the release of test results, lest they be
hopelessly skewed.</LD>
<LD>   When the state offered school districts $450 million in
construction funds this year, L.A. Unified applied for the whole pot
and then some--$916 million. Pity poor Tustin Unified, which stood at
the front of that application line, only to get shoved aside by the
800-pound gorilla.</LD>
<TE>   "How does a district of 18,000 kids come up against a district
with nearly 800,000 kids?" asked Brock Wagner, Tustin Unified's
business officer.</TE>
<TE>   While L.A. Unified marshaled a cadre of lobbyists and lawyers to
persuade the state to change the funding rules in its favor, Tustin
had "just me," Wagner said. "We're not even in the same game as those
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Few are. With 748,000 children and 159,000 adult students, and a
$9.8-billion budget--comparable to the gross national product of
Costa Rica--L.A. Unified is the second-largest school district in the
nation, behind New York City.</TE>
<TE>   It uses its heft to advantage, buying its paper from the mill and
its apples by the orchard. But for all its advantages, the district's
girth often hinders reform and inhibits public involvement.</TE>
<TE>   With seven powerful labor unions and hundreds of middle managers
and school principals vying for resources, the district is rife with
schisms and political intrigues. L.A. schools Supt. Roy Romer has
commented on how his experience as a state governor and Democratic
Party operative left him unprepared for Los Angeles Unified's
internecine political wars.</TE>
<TE>   Being superintendent "is a more difficult job by quite a ways,"
Romer said earlier this year. "I never knew politics until I got
here."</TE>
<TE>   It is all the more difficult to run the district because there is
no reliable way to track how resources are being used. Several audits
have found that the district's data systems are so antiquated that it
would take years, and millions of dollars, to bring them up to date.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAUSD does not know how many employees it has working in what
positions at any given time, or how much they get paid," according to
a 1999 L&amp;L Fuller Inc. audit.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has not yet been solved, district officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The district has more than 50 discrete computer databases--and
offices full of student records on paper and microfiche that never
have been computerized, said Megan Klee, the district's chief
technology official.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified's payroll system is so outdated that every pay
period, each of the district's 85,000 employees must fill out paper
time sheets, longhand, and correct them with white-out.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on Estimates</TE>
<TE>   The district can't track all of its supplies, or its 6,000
financial accounts, in real time. It is only able to nail down actual
expenses once every quarter, said Romer, forcing the district to rely
on estimates based on financial trends.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a large, complex organization, and we don't calculate
week-by-week savings," he said. "We have to add it up every three
months."</TE>
<TE>   That is how budget officials discovered only this month that there
was an extra $228 million from the fiscal year ending in June spread
over hundreds of district accounts. That's only about 5% of L.A.
Unified's operating budget--close enough at most districts. But 5% of
L.A. Unified's general fund amounts to nearly half the operating
budget of Long Beach Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Those who would like to see the district split up say that any
entity so large is bound to be a bureaucratic basket case. Some
parents feel alienated in a bureaucracy that can bounce them from
functionary to functionary without ever giving them a straight
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I want L.A. [Unified] to be more accessible and accountable, and
the only way to do that is to make it smaller--not dinky, but smaller
than it is now," said Stephanie Carter, who is co-chair of a group
that supports a separate San Fernando Valley district and whose
daughter just graduated from high school.</TE>
<TE>   A measure on November's ballot to allow the San Fernando Valley to
secede from Los Angeles has received support from some residents who
believe--mistakenly--that it would break up the district.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, no area has split off from L.A. Unified since Torrance in
1948. Last November, Carson residents defeated a proposal to form a
separate district after an anti-secession blitz by the teachers
union, United Teachers-Los Angeles. A month later, the state Board of
Education voted 10 to 0 against a proposal to create a separate San
Fernando Valley school district, finding it unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   The separatist movements did, however, spur the giant district to
form 11 subdistricts two years ago. The creation of the
mini-districts was meant to make L.A. Unified more responsive, but
some parents and legislators say the district's central bureaucracy
has been loath to cede authority--or money--to regional offices.</TE>
<TE>   New York City has vacillated, as well, between centralized and
decentralized management. Its mega-district first spun off
mini-districts in the 1970s, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg has begun to
consolidate his office's authority over the system and its 1.1
million students.</TE>
<TE>   "After a system gets a certain size, you need some kind of
regional [mini-district] structure that makes management less
unwieldy," said Beverly Donohue, the chief financial officer for New
York City schools.</TE>
<TE>   But even if L.A. Unified's subdistricts became separate school
systems, each of them would rank among the 100 largest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Size Matters</TE>
<TE>   For now, the district does everything on an imperial scale. It is
the biggest landowner in Los Angeles, with many more schools and
educational centers (907) than Starbucks has coffeehouses (250) in
Los Angeles County. It is now planning to build 120 more and expand
79 others.</TE>
<TE>   Size can work in L.A. Unified's favor. If it needs to push its
weight around in Sacramento, it can count on a delegation of 22 state
legislators, along with a superintendent, Romer, who is a former
three-term governor of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, sizable districts like Los Angeles' and New York
City's can be excellent laboratories for new educational practices.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are doing research around whether a particular program is
meaningful or has results, we're large enough so that we can draw
conclusions based on our own practices," New York's Donohue said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said that test scores released Tuesday, for example,
provided large-scale validation of the intensive Open Court reading
program, implemented in the early grades throughout the district.</TE>
<TE>   USC education professor Lawrence Picus says that, if they are
effectively managed, big districts are often more efficient and spend
less on administration than many smaller districts, which sometimes
spend as much as 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, Los Angeles Unified is a very large corporation. But
there are a lot of bigger organizations--Exxon, or the U.S. military,
for instance," said Picus, adding that if L.A. Unified were "L.A.
Unified Inc." it would land around the middle of the Fortune 500
list.</TE>
<TE>   Being big allows a district to benefit from economies of scale,
said Howard Nelson, a researcher with the American Federation of
Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union.</TE>
<TE>   "Just take a labor union contract: You have one negotiating team
whether you have 100,000 teachers or 20 teachers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, labor unions backed a California ballot initiative that
would have required California school districts to restrict overhead
costs to 5% of their budgets. But the measure was defeated after a
state legislative study calculated that of the state's 994 districts,
only 94 would have been able to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Los Angeles Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of the need for greater efficiency, school
districts have been growing since the 1940s, said Diane Ravitch, a
leading education historian.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of World War II, there were over 100,000 school
districts; now there are just 15,000," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller Schools Favored</TE>
<TE>   As districts have grown, big schools have fallen out of favor with
most education experts. Studies show that students perform better on
smaller campuses that allow for more individualized attention.
Although the biggest schools are often found in the nation's biggest
school districts--Los Angeles schools, for example, account for five
of America's 15 largest campuses--education experts say that doesn't
have to be so.</TE>
<TE>   Some school districts--Houston's and New York City's, for
example--have experimented with smaller campuses in leased spaces, or
even separate "academies" within existing schools. Los Angeles
Unified has also created such schools-within-schools at several
campuses. Alexander Hamilton High School on the Westside, for
example, houses a humanities magnet program, a music academy and a
regular school on one large campus.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main purposes of a $3.3-billion school construction
bond coming before voters this November is to build schools to ease
overcrowding and scale down enrollment at individual campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ravitch: "You could, in theory, have a school with 400 or 500
kids in it, and it wouldn't matter if the district had 1 million or
5,000 kids."</TE>

<HD>Building Site Is on Hallowed Ground</HD>
<DH>Ojai: Ancient Chumash burial place containing tools, bowls
and bones is returned to the state in which it was found as condos
rise nearby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction workers have stumbled across one of the largest and
oldest Chumash burial sites in the Ojai area, dating as far back as
10,000 years, archeologists and tribal members said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "In my experience, this is the biggest collection of artifacts
found in Ojai," said Pat Tumamait, a Chumash consultant who monitors
construction projects to ensure that Native American relics are not
destroyed or desecrated.</LD>
<LD>   The site contains tools, bowls and the cremated remains of between
two and five people, buried beneath pieces of grinding stones called
metates.</LD>
<TE>   The bone fragments were found two weeks ago when a truck grading
land for the Los Arboles Townhomes project smacked into hard rock.
Tumamait immediately halted the construction.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some metates, and in our native culture when someone
died they'd put these metates over the burial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully sifting the dirt, Tumamait and archeologist Dan Hissong
found bits of bone under the stones. Excited but unwilling to disturb
the site further, Tumamait stopped digging. Police were told of the
site and the county coroner's office analyzed bits of bone to verify
they were human, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a significant find, but we have to respect the Chumash. You
can't go digging things up and taking them to museums anymore," said
Hissong, who works with Tumamait to analyze archeological finds.
"Those days are gone." The area, at the back of a dirt lot, was
discreetly marked off and Tumamait performed a ceremony for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave food offerings of acorns, fish, bread, water and fruit,"
he said. "And we burnt sage. The offering of food and gifts is
basically an apology for disturbing them and to see they have food
for their journey."</TE>
<TE>   Tumamait and Hissong determined the age of the site by the style
and shape of the metates, which they say are 7,000 to 10,000 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the land responded quickly to the discovery,
redesigning the area to accommodate the grave. The bones were found
where the dumpsters would have been located.</TE>
<TE>   Now there will be a 16-by-30-foot "green space" of native
California plants above the gravesite. No additional construction
will take place on that part of the property, said construction
superintendent Don Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it's incredible to think that these are someone's
ancestors," Smith said. "It's great that we were able to catch it in
time."</TE>
<TE>   The 23-unit luxury condominium complex will sit on three acres
near Ojai's Libbey Park. Plans for the site have outraged some
residents who fear it will bring further congestion to an artists'
haven known for its tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of years before condos and congestion, the Chumash
had already settled the valley, calling it "Auhai," meaning moon in
their language, said Tumamait. Some lived in villages dotted with
cone-shaped huts while others from the coast spent a few months at a
time here each year. They mostly ate acorns ground with stone
mortars.</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Valley's rich history as a crossroads of Chumash life was
discovered years ago just below the surface. Tools, bowls, stone
pipes and sometimes human remains are commonly discovered a few feet
underground.</TE>
<TE>   Artifacts were found when the town's police station was being
built, relics were discovered along Ventura Avenue during a
sanitation district project and burial relics were located in Soule
Park, Tumamait said.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole valley is an archeological site," said Tumamait, who
has worked since 1991 as a construction site monitor. "This site is
pretty significant. It rates about an 8 or 9 for what I have found in
the past."</TE>
<TE>   Why the remains were cremated is a mystery. Archeologists say the
Chumash were usually buried facing west to watch the setting sun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual--most bodies are found intact," said Tumamait, who
has found human remains near Thomas Aquinas College between Santa
Paula and Ojai, in Malibu and in Saticoy. "This area looks like a
village encampment site."</TE>
<TE>   Along with other cities, Ojai usually requires a Native American
monitor and an archeologist to be present on any city building
project in case artifacts are found.</TE>
<TE>   The two follow the backhoes and front loaders tearing up the
ground and painstakingly search through dirt piles for signs of the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, the site superintendent, said that working this way takes
about three times longer than traditional building methods.</TE>
<TE>   Tumamait said the most important artifacts will be put in a
display case on the property when the project is finished. Everything
else will be taken somewhere where it won't be disturbed, and be
buried.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled an incident years ago when a woman brought some
Chumash bones to his father for reburial. After taking the remains to
a remote site, Tumamait and his father drove away.</TE>
<TE>   "In leaving the area, a large buzzard flew down from the top of
the canyon, swooping right over us," he said. "Hopefully, it was a
sign that the person was finally at peace."</TE>

<DH>Mascot camp helps teens tackle a job that requires an
oversized sense of humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLETA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Some a little plump and uncoordinated--and all unabashedly
goofy--these 11 teens at summer spirit camp don't look or act much
like cheerleaders.</LD>
<LD>   In a sea of bouncy, ribboned ponytails and tight shorts, the
mascots at this UC Santa Barbara camp stand out--even when wearing
everyday attire rather than oversized Viking helmets or suits of
electric blue fur.</LD>
<LD>   Mascots, clearly, are a breed apart.</LD>
<TE>   This four-day summer school helps trainees better entertain their
crowds, teaching them to bring their characters to life through
sideline gags, novelty routines or audience interaction.</TE>
<TE>   During a workshop held on the steaming black asphalt of a
dormitory parking lot, one trainee had a shaved head and a struggling
mustache, while another sported hair bleached the color of corn. A
few rows back, Ryan Jauman, 17, of Huntington Beach's Marina High was
sprawled on the ground in SpongeBob SquarePants pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheerleaders have to be structured, but we can be our own
person," said Ryan, who wears Viking regalia during games. "I'm not
afraid to make a fool of myself."</TE>
<TE>   The United Spirit Assn., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is unique in
the nation for having a curriculum and staff specialized for mascots.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't just what we have time for after the cheer stuff is
done," said Dawn Norkewicz of Port Hueneme, the association's mascot
camp coordinator. During the school year, she coaches Ventura
College's pep squad and the mascots for St. Bonaventure High in
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   One exercise involved the mascots' donning their respective heads,
then figuring out how to accurately cover their eyes, put their
fingers in their ears and pick their noses. That launched a brief
debate over the location of a hawk's nostrils. In another exercise,
they brainstormed creative uses for props, including a plastic orange
shovel and an inflatable saxophone, from Norkewicz's seemingly
bottomless duffel bag.</TE>
<TE>   Creativity always wins people over, she said. Instead of just
putting on a fan's baseball cap--"that's pretty basic"--she suggested
using it as a bowl and pretending to eat, or squatting over the cap
as if it were a toilet.</TE>
<TE>   "It may seem juvenile to get laughs from a toilet [joke], but if
that entertains your crowd, then you've done your job," Norkewicz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Defining one's persona is key to creating a memorable mascot,
Norkewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   Cristina Grace of Bishop High, for example, plans to make her
Bronco "very girly. Like Minnie Mouse, but a horse."</TE>
<TE>   When Norkewicz played minute-long snippets of music for the
mascots to dance to, people bicycling by and construction workers at
a nearby site stared, mouths agape, as the Wasco High tiger bounced
to "Zoot Suit Riot" and the Redwood Ranger wiggled her rear during a
Mexican folk song.</TE>
<TE>   Norkewicz suggested creating mascot traditions like ringing a bell
or doing push-ups after touchdowns--"always hysterical when it's a
mascot doing it."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I could get back up," mumbled Ryan, looking dubious
as he recorded the idea in his orange mascot camp handbook.</TE>
<TE>   If all else fails, Norkewicz suggested pantomiming other people at
the game, whether it's a vendor hawking sodas or a girl touching up
her makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "Just mascotize whatever they're doing," she said. "Imitating
someone is always good for a laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with children was a recurring topic during the sessions,
especially for those with more intimidating costumes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's afraid of my school's mascot," said Ryan, staring at
the Viking head with its piercing green eyes and toothy leer. "I'm
afraid of my mascot."</TE>
<TE>   Norkewicz suggested shaking hands with kids, passing out candy and
posing for Polaroids. For truly terrified children, she demonstrated
how the students should squat to kid height and pretend to be scared
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In 14 years heading the mascot program, her biggest challenge has
been developing characters for potato mascots from Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   For unusual mascots like the Shelley High Russets, or abstract
concepts like colors or shapes, Norkewicz tells students to pick a
personality and build the mascot around that. Specifying the
character's gender or emulating an icon like Superman or Betty Boop
can enliven any character, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget about being a red dot," she said. "You're going to be a
cute, sexy red dot."</TE>
<TE>   She ended up dubbing the potatoes "King and Queen Russet" and
teaching them routines that played off those titles. Mascots like the
Indians from Alemany High in Granada Hills present another sort of
challenge, because the school doesn't allow the boys to dress up as
Indians or perform skits playing off that name. Instead, they wear
oversized Mickey Mouse gloves and must rely on their own rowdiness to
entertain the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really rough sometimes, but at least I can see better" with
no costume, said Joe Yamauchi, 17, of Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   For Cristina the Bronco, the dancing routines are the most
difficult. A self-labeled "slow learner," the 15-year-old said she
would have loved to be a cheerleader but she's too uncoordinated.</TE>
<TE>   Her hair in two tight French braids, wearing a navy sports bra and
shorts, Cristina looks like a stereotypical cheerleader--until the
music blares and she starts to dance. Quickly losing track of the
steps, she yells, "Slower! Slower!" when the instructors incorporate
the Tootsie Roll move.</TE>
<TE>   "As a mascot you're pretty much supposed to mess up," she said.
"But it's still hard."</TE>
<TE>   The one mascot who manages to look graceful in costume is Serina
Davis, the Redwood Ranger from Visalia, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   A cheerleader for five years, Serina missed tryouts when her
family moved in midyear from Arizona. So the 16-year-old took on the
mascot role, along with a new blue forest ranger costume topped with
the head of her character wearing a hat.</TE>
<TE>   As the rest of her peers strained to remember the steps to their
routines, Serina's added flourishes made her look like a pubescent
Rockette--albeit one wearing Paul Bunyan-size black boots.</TE>
<TE>   Walking and dancing in those boots has been one of the more
difficult aspects of being a mascot, said Serina. But overall, she
said the experience is refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've been at camp, I've acted a lot sillier: singing,
dancing up and down the halls, having fun," she said. "I'm not as
worried about being perfect."</TE>

<HD>Cypress Nears Land Deal With Church</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: The proposal would let the city have the site
and give Cottonwood a nearby property that is now part of a golf
course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cypress and Cottonwood Christian Center appear close to settling
their nationally watched feud over the city's effort to use the
church's land for a tax revenue-generating Costco.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, the church would get a larger property nearby,
on what is now the Cypress Golf Course. The city would take over the
18 acres at the intersection of Walker Street and Katella Avenue,
where Cottonwood had planned to build a mega-church for its 4,000
members, then would sell that land to Costco or another "big box"
retailer.</LD>
<LD>   "There is great potential there," said the Rev. Mike Wilson,
project manager for Cottonwood, adding that the golf course is "a
fine site."</LD>
<TE>   Such a settlement would cut short what has become a national test
case of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a
2000 federal law that exempts churches from most local zoning
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   City officials contend that the church bought the property in 1999
despite warnings that it was in a redevelopment zone where Cypress
planned a large retail center--warnings the church said were never
made.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders nationwide have accused the city of discriminating
against Cottonwood. Land use experts from the American Planning Assn.
and elsewhere have rallied around Cypress, saying a Cottonwood
victory in court would give religious institutions carte blanche to
wreak havoc with local planning.</TE>
<TE>   This month U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ordered
Cypress to stop its condemnation proceedings pending a trial in
March. Carter's opinion chastised the city for its heavy-handedness
in moving to take the property. Carter warned the city that it may be
violating the new federal act.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling has increased pressure on the city to settle, because
Carter would be the trial judge. Tuesday afternoon, city and church
officials held settlement talks for the first time since the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-acre portion of the golf course that would become the
church's is now owned by Ed Allred, who also owns the adjacent Los
Alamitos Race Course. Allred says he would sell Cottonwood most of
the 28 acres for $17 million and donate the rest to the church for a
tax break.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot depends on whether the city can pay enough to the church
for its land to make this possible," Allred said. "They seem to be
fairly close to a meeting of the minds."</TE>
<TE>   Church and city officials said they could not disclose financial
details. Negotiations had been slow until a few months ago, mostly
because Cottonwood was unable to find affordable properties in north
Orange County suitable for the 300,000-square-foot church it plans.</TE>
<TE>   After Allred purchased the golf course in the spring, he pitched
the land swap to the church and the city as a feasible alternative.
Allred would not disclose how much he paid for the 92-acre golf
course but acknowledged that he would profit in the church deal. He
would use the rest of the golf course for other development projects,
he said. "We had no idea it was even on the market," Allred said of
the golf course. "It works out perfectly. It solves a lot of
problems."</TE>
<TE>   The city had earlier tried to take the church property for $14.5
million through eminent domain. Under the proposed land swap, the
city would have to pay the $17 million Allred is asking and possibly
reimburse the church for what it has spent at its existing site on
planning and design, accumulated interest and attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   City officials downplayed the higher cost of the land, saying the
$14.5 million was always a starting point from which to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the city can afford the new price may depend on what
Costco is willing to pay for the land the church would be leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in negotiations with Costco as to how a potential deal
might look," said David Belmer, Cypress community development
director. He said the city may ultimately offer Costco or some other
retailer a tax break to make the swap possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The city will put a deal together that in our opinion makes
sense," Belmer said. "There will be no subsidies unless there is a
reasonable return on our investment."</TE>
<TE>   If the land swap can be worked out, it will cement the city's
redevelopment plan. Much of the redevelopment zone lies in property
that Allred owns, and he is working with the city on plans to
transform asphalt-covered lots and a barely profitable golf course
into a bustling retail district.</TE>
<TE>   Allred plans to build several shops on 13 acres connected to the
proposed Costco as well as a pod of restaurants on a 2-acre site
nearby. Marriott has already put a hotel in the area, and another
builder might put in a fitness center.</TE>
<TE>   The church would take up a third of the golf course. The rest,
Allred said, could be used as housing and a training facility for the
racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a solution that works out for everyone," he
said. "The city just needs to give the church enough money to make it
happen."</TE>

<HD>Gigante Is Allowed a Grocery</HD>
<DH>Retail: Reversing city planners, Anaheim council lets
Mexican store buy liquor license.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly three hours of debate, the Anaheim City Council granted
a liquor license to Gigante late Tuesday night, paving the way for
the Mexican grocery store chain to open its first Orange County
supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   The decision overturns an earlier vote by the Planning Commission
and effectively ends a controversy that sparked allegations of racism
in a city where about half the population is Latino.</LD>
<LD>   "Logic has prevailed; now our job begins," said Gigante USA
President Justo Frias. "Our job is to have a first-class supermarket
in Anaheim, and we will start on that ASAP."</LD>
<TE>   The issue had touched off a hot political debate over free
enterprise and U.S.-Mexico relations and attracted national and local
media coverage, leaving Anaheim officials stung by what they
considered unfounded accusations of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The council had to determine whether to grant Gigante's liquor
license application--considered essential for any supermarket.
Without a license, Gigante's first proposed supermarket in Orange
County would have been hobbled, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In front of a standing-room-only audience of more than 250 people,
the council voted 3 to 1 to grant the license. Councilman Frank
Feldhaus cast the only dissenting vote, saying that the city already
has an overabundance of establishments selling liquor.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Tom Daly abstained from the vote because of a conflict of
interest and was not present during the discussion. Daly is a
consultant to an association of which Gigante is a member.</TE>
<TE>   Although several people clapped and cheered after the vote, one
audience member shouted at the council, "The blood is on your hands."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue of property rights," Councilman Tom Tait said.
"It's an issue of freedom to sell what you would like. It's really an
issue of fairness. When no other [Anaheim] supermarket has that
restriction, I don't see how we could do that to Gigante or any other
business that comes into our city."</TE>
<TE>   Although the council approved the license, Gigante must first buy
one from another business in the city--a condition store officials
said was reasonable. Gigante already has bought a license that will
allow it to sell beer and wine; in order to sell hard liquor they
must purchase another license.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came just hours after Gigante's chairman, who flew to
Anaheim from Mexico City, charged city officials with violating
international trade agreements and of slighting a well-respected
company just because it's based in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "You know and I know that this is not about liquor licenses," said
Angel Losada, chairman of the billion-dollar, Mexico-based
supermarket chain's parent company, Grupo Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about allowing a successful and well-respected business,
which happens to be headquartered in Mexico, to do business and
compete head-to-head in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Losada said that a denial is a violation of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, which prohibits cities from holding a
Mexico-based company to different standards from their U.S.
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante has 270 stores in Mexico and three in Southern California,
and wants to open a store in Anaheim Plaza, a renovated outdoor
shopping mall just off the Santa Ana Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Losada said Gigante planned to invest $5 million in the Anaheim
store and create 150 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Nativo Lopez, co-director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an
organization that assists Spanish-speaking immigrants, likened the
city's actions to "market racial profiling" by trying to direct where
Gigante should be allowed to open.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, more than a dozen people spoke out against
Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   Some said Anaheim, which already accounts for one-quarter of all
the county's 2,000 liquor licenses, doesn't need any more.</TE>
<TE>   A few speakers, including anti-immigration advocate Barbara Coe,
said the city doesn't need a business that caters to Latinos because
it would attract illegal immigrants and create "barrios" within the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim resident Johanna Hof also accused Gigante's public
relations firm of playing "the race card" and stirring up
neighborhood hostility.</TE>
<TE>   Store officials already stopped pursuing one shopping center near
Knott's Berry Farm after Mayor Tom Daly encouraged Frias to look
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Daly told Gigante that the area, zoned for redevelopment, was
better suited for a retail business that would draw more sales tax
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Store officials complied, only to later find out that the shopping
center owner was negotiating with Albertson's, another grocery chain.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante officials kept searching for a location and eventually
settled on a vacant store in Anaheim Plaza. About 60% of the area's
residents are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Stipkovich, Anaheim's redevelopment director, objected to
that site as well, saying the market didn't fit the city's plans to
expand the discount retail complex to draw people from beyond the
immediate neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversial memo, Stipkovich accused Gigante of being too
Latino and of failing to serve the public at large. She added that
Gigante's product selection "catered primarily to the Hispanic
market" and city staffers were "surprised to find that the store
signage and music were predominantly in Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   Stipkovich said the city's concern has nothing to do with
ethnicity. Rather, she said, the city simply does not want a grocery
store in the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante officials and Latino leaders still frequently cite
Stipkovich's memo as evidence of discrimination. Anaheim Plaza owners
and property managers also said that city officials asked them to
look for mainstream grocery store tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Stipkovich's concerns, Gigante officials signed a lease at
Anaheim Plaza. They were preparing to move in when they were denied a
liquor license by the city Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Staff initially recommended that the Planning Commission deny
Gigante's request because the area is saturated with liquor licenses.</TE>
<TE>   They amended that recommendation to the City Council, saying that
granting a license would be acceptable if Gigante can transfer an
existing license within a three-quarter-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   But Gigante's attorney said that obstacle was the result of a
realization that staff couldn't "come in the front door with a gun,"
so instead "came in the back door with a knife."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the council lifted the three-quarter-mile restriction.</TE>

<HD>Final Word: Health Care Centers Cut</HD>
<DH>Services: Board votes to close 15 county facilities by Oct.
1 to cope with budget deficit. Union says the wounds that will
inflict 'won't heal.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning aside final pleas from patients and health workers, the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to close 11 health
centers and four school-based health clinics by Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   About 700 people filled the board's meeting room for the second
time in three months to bemoan the closures and other cuts, which
together will trim $31.3 million from next year's health budget. The
meeting was full of passion but lacked suspense--the supervisors
signaled at the outset that the cuts were unavoidable because the
Department of Health Services faces a growing deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The board's unanimous vote, which is final, paves the way for
officials to begin cutting services starting Aug. 30. All 15 clinics
are scheduled to close by Oct. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Under the plan, public health spending also will be cut about 10%
by reducing childhood immunizations, screenings for sexually
transmitted diseases and visits for communicable diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Also, High Desert Hospital in the Antelope Valley would be
converted from a hospital to an outpatient clinic in May 2003. But
supervisors provided a glimmer of hope to those trying to save the
hospital. The board approved a six-month pilot project that would try
to generate new revenue by offering unused beds to neighboring
hospitals and medical groups.</TE>
<TE>   Notices of closures will be posted in clinics beginning today,
advising patients of alternative locations to find care.</TE>
<TE>   Two health centers, in North Hollywood and Tujunga, will cease
accepting walk-in patients on Aug. 30. Services gradually will be
phased out until all sites are closed by the end of next month.</TE>
<TE>   Five other clinics were ordered closed in an earlier round of cuts
this year. In the end, the county will continue to operate seven
health centers that offer primary health-care services.</TE>
<TE>   The union representing county health workers criticized the
supervisors for their "headlong rush" to make cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "To ignore the voices and needs of the community would be a
health-care and political disaster," said Annelle Grajeda, general
manager of Service Employees International Union Local 660, which
represents 19,000 county health workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Any cuts ought to be made only after careful consideration of
voices and needs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Waving placards that read "These cuts won't heal," SEIU members
tromped up and down the sidewalk in front of the Hall of
Administration, at one point marching into the street and sparking a
scuffle with police.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen members of the union were arrested for failure to
disperse, said Jason Lee, an LAPD spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Health Services Director Dr. Thomas Garthwaite
defended the cuts, saying that clients would have access to other
health centers for medical care. He also said the 11 health centers
slated for closure are in need of critical maintenance and repairs
totaling $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The centers, he said, are inefficient compared with clinics run by
private health providers. The average medical visit costs $150 at the
clinics slated for closure, compared with $90 at other clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Kersey, executive director of Maternal and Child Health
Access, disputed the assertion that patients would be able to travel
five miles to visit another clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Five miles as the crow flies is not five miles on a bus with two
children," Kersey said.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic closures and public health cutbacks will displace 360
health workers, all of whom are expected to be moved to other
positions. If the department proceeds with its plans to end inpatient
services at High Desert and cut the number of beds at other county
hospitals, officials expect to achieve 4,230 job cuts by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors first approved the cuts on June 26, which prompted
Tuesday's hearing to receive public input before the decision could
be finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on our last leg, unfortunately, in this whole area,"
Supervisor Gloria Molina said at the start of the four-hour meeting.
"This is one of the most unfortunate votes I will ever make on this
Board of Supervisors."</TE>
<TE>   She warned that the first round of cuts "is not as painful" as
those the board may be asked to impose in October if officials cannot
secure another federal bailout. That round of cuts could pare beds
and services at already overwhelmed county hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, supervisors have acknowledged that they are pushing
this first round of cuts partly because they hope to prove their
mettle to Washington and receive another round of federal assistance.
But Tuesday, the board angrily denied that it was engaging in
"gamesmanship," as one speaker put it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Supervisors Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky criticized Gov.
Gray Davis for refusing to meet with board members or offer
additional money to help balance Los Angeles County's health budget.
"I want to disabuse you of the notion that this is political gaming,"
Yaroslavsky said. "It's about what the state is bringing to the
table."</TE>
<TE>   "We sat and stood on the front door of Gov. Gray Davis' office,"
Molina said. "Not one time would they meet with us."</TE>
<TE>   Grantland Johnson, secretary of California's Health and Human
Services Agency, said he can't explain why Davis wouldn't meet with
the supervisors. But he said the governor has instructed his staff to
work with the county.</TE>
<TE>   Before forwarding the bailout request to Washington, state
officials want the county to hold additional meetings and explain how
it will protect patient access to care in a smaller system.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are going to be competent stewards of the health-care
system in L.A. County and California, we have to understand the
implications and nuances of the county's proposal," Johnson said. "I
want to understand what they're proposing, what the ramifications
are, before we're prepared to take that proposal to the feds."</TE>
<TE>   Marsha Temple, an attorney for the Venice Family Clinic, pleaded
with supervisors to wait 90 days before approving the cuts and work
with the state to find ways to keep medical facilities open.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of you has promised to protect the people of this county,"
she said. "If you will not protect them when they are sick and dying,
when will you protect them?"</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers said the supervisors were being hypocritical by
cutting services while asking taxpayers in November to approve a
$175-million tax to shore up the county's fraying network of
emergency rooms and trauma centers, and aid bioterrorism
preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every aspect of the county's plan came under criticism from

<TE>   Anna Garcia, a sixth-grader at Vaughn Street Elementary School in
Pacoima, asked the board not to close school health clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in Pacoima and our families are poor, but children do not
have to die because they are poor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be healthy so we can take care of you when you grow

<HD>Easing Path to Driver's Licenses</HD>
<DH>Bill: Gov. Davis is poised to approve authorization for
undocumented immigrants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>After months of negotiations following the Sept. 11 attacks, the
California Legislature on Tuesday sent Gov. Gray Davis a measure that
would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver's
licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, speaking to reporters in San Francisco, indicated that he
expects to sign the bill, in part because he believes separate
legislation will address security implications raised by making
licenses easier to obtain.</LD>
<LD>   The California Senate also passed a bill to make Bodie the state's
official gold rush ghost town, and the Assembly honored a departing
lawmaker known for speeding by naming a stretch of highway after him,
as lawmakers continued to debate a crush of legislation before
month's end.</LD>
<TE>   The driver's license bill, AB 60 by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los
Angeles) actually cleared the Legislature last year with strong
backing from Latino advocacy groups, but lawmakers pulled it back
from the governor's desk after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks raised
new safety questions. Some of the participants in the East Coast
attacks reportedly had obtained false driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo and Davis had hoped to resolve the concerns and turn the
measure, which would allow an estimated 200,000 immigrants to obtain
driving privileges, into law early his year.</TE>
<TE>   However, efforts to broker a compromise faltered as law
enforcement leaders demanded changes--notably, a different class of
driver's license for the immigrants--that Cedillo and immigrant
activists said would open the door to discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Though the differences were not fully resolved Tuesday, Cedillo
opted to send the measure to Davis, saying he is confident that a
second piece of legislation awaiting passage in the Senate will take
care of the problems. Similarly, Davis said during a news conference
in San Francisco that he was "optimistic I will be able to sign the
bill" because Cedillo was making changes.</TE>
<TE>   "He is introducing some amendments that more or less reflect my
point of view," Davis said, adding, "People who contribute to our
economy and pay taxes are deserving of that privilege" of obtaining a
license.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, who initially challenged the
wisdom of licensing illegal immigrants, said Tuesday that, after
discussing the matter with Davis, he now supports the compromise
package.</TE>
<TE>   The changes contained in the second piece of legislation, AB 1206,
were still in flux Tuesday, but involved two major concessions by
Cedillo: requiring thorough background checks by the state Department
of Justice, and mandating that applicants prove they have lived and
worked in the state for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo declined to explain his reasons for sending the original
measure to the governor before finishing the companion bill. But
another lawmaker said Cedillo had grown tired of negotiating with the
Davis administration and wanted to place pressure on the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "My responsibility as an elected official is to put forth what I
consider to be good public policy," Cedillo said afterward. "And that
is what I did."</TE>
<TE>   The Bodie ghost town bill, AB 1757 by Republican Tim Leslie of
Tahoe City, initially stalled due to competition from the old mining
town of Calico, which worried that singling out Bodie as the official
ghost town would hurt its lively tourism industry. However, a
compromise was reached that would make Bodie the official "gold rush"
ghost town, and Calico the official "silver rush" ghost town. The
Calico bill will likely be introduced next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly's roadway resolution, ACR 234 by Democrat Joe
Canciamilla of Pittsburg, would name a portion of Highway 1 in San
Mateo County "The Louis J. Papan Highway" after Lou Papan--a Millbrae
Democrat whose numerous run-ins with the California Highway Patrol
earned him the nickname "Leadfoot Lou."</TE>
<TE>   Papan, a Capitol veteran who returned to the Legislature in 1996
and is now being forced from office by term limits, did not allow
lawmakers to honor him earlier this year, despite being the dean of
the older house. Thus, Canciamilla and others took it upon themselves
to do so in fitting fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Amid raucous chants of "Lou! Lou! Lou!" Papan graciously accepted.
But he made no attempt to atone for his traffic record:</TE>
<TE>   "I've done everything within my power to keep radar off the
freeways," Papan remarked, recalling his long, ultimately losing
fight against the law.</TE>
<TE>   In other action:</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate approved a measure by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles) that would require employers of 100 workers or more
to annually report on the ethnic and gender composition of their work
force.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) cited the bill, AB 1309, as an
example of the state pushing private employers to do more than the
state does itself. A Senate survey of Davis appointees who are
subject to confirmation showed that 27% were women and 73% were
white. The bill, which passed on a 26-12 vote, still needs Assembly
approval.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate defeated a bill by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe
(D-San Diego) that would have allowed use of a school or community
college district's public funds for electioneering purposes by an
employee union.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by the California Federation of Teachers, AB 2903 needed
21 votes for approval, but failed on an 18-16 vote.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate passed a bill by Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los
Feliz) that would prohibit Internet sales of cigarettes and other
tobacco products to children in California. Online sellers would be
required to verify that purchasers of tobacco products were 18. AB
1830, which passed on a 21-13 vote, now returns to the Assembly for
final approval.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed a bill by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco) that would prohibit drug manufacturers from disclosing
health information about a patient without the patient's approval. AB
2191, which garnered a 26-12 vote, returns to the Assembly for final
approval.</TE>

<LD>Jeanie Bernstein of Laguna Beach doesn't know if she'll be able to
get within six blocks of President Bush on Friday, but the
79-year-old rabble-rouser is rounding up the posse and getting the
protest signs ready.</LD>
<LD>   The president will be at a Dana Point fund-raiser on a mission
from God, attempting the miracle of raising California GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill "Simple" Simon from the dead.</LD>
<LD>   Bernstein is attempting a miracle of her own. She is trying to get
fellow Orange County residents to challenge Bush's saber-rattling
drive toward war on Iraq, a war that will be like a stick to a
hornet's nest, setting the U.S. up for decades of retaliation.</LD>
<TE>   I don't know if it's a case of widespread support or just plain
apathy, but I don't recall a time in my life when talk of war spurred
less debate in the United States. And Orange County, quite frankly,
was the last place I expected to find a resistance movement.</TE>
<TE>   But I was strolling down the South Coast Highway in downtown
Laguna Beach Saturday when I came upon Bernstein's posse. The first
guy I spoke to was holding two signs. One said, "No War 4 Oil," and
the other said, "Violence Begets Violence."</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had I learned Bill Strahan's name than a young man
pulled up in a Ford Extinction, or some such vehicle the size of an
armored personnel carrier.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, wearing a baseball cap, leaned out the window and
yelled:</TE>
<TE>   "Hey [blank], go the [blank] back where you belong!"</TE>
<TE>   Strahan, 66, reacted calmly as the true American roared away.</TE>
<TE>   "I find that very interesting," said the retired mathematician
from Orange. "This is where I belong. My family's been in this
country for five generations."</TE>
<TE>   Strahan, exercising a right he holds dear--the right of
dissent--had already had four such reactions in 30 minutes. "But I'm
getting a lot of support too," he said with hope in his voice, waving
to a driver who honked.</TE>
<TE>   Strahan pointed down the road a ways to the rest of the crew--half
a dozen folks waving protest signs from the comfort of lawn chairs.
Jeanie Bernstein's sign said, "War Is Not The Answer."</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach has changed a lot in the last several decades.
Members of Bernstein's gang say it used to be politically eclectic,
but with skyrocketing real estate prices, it has become more
conservative.</TE>
<TE>   But one constant, going back to the 1960s, has been the sight of
Jeanie Bernstein in front of Main Beach on Saturdays between 11 a.m.
and 1 p.m. She waved a protest sign through the entire Vietnam War,
and for 11 years during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein reappeared during the Gulf War, and then, when Bush
centered Saddam Hussein in his cross-hairs three or four months ago,
she was back at her post. It's a great location because traffic is
always jammed on this gorgeous stretch of South Coast Highway by
Ocean Avenue, which makes for a captive audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like our country is way too eager to jump in with a
violent resolution to just about any conflict," said Bernstein. "If
we would dedicate just a small percentage of what we spend on arms to
eradicating hunger, poverty, disease, homelessness and all of those
bad things, it would go a long way toward advancing the cause of
peace."</TE>
<TE>   For holding such principles, Bernstein has been cursed, flipped
off and told to get a life. So has the rest of her gang of retirees
and middle-aged reformers, which last week included Shirley McGovern,
Anita Dobbs, Maxine Quirk, Chuck Anderson and Elizabeth Erger, who
goes all the way back to the Vietnam days with Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone called us a bunch of old hippies," said Anderson. "I told
him we're not old."</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have a sign that said, 'Honk for peace,' but someone
complained about all the noise," Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Anderson. "They're inconvenienced by horn honking,
but not by thousands of people being murdered and maimed. We should
have a sign that says 'Don't honk for peace.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then they'd honk for sure, the gang agreed.</TE>
<TE>   A gargantuan gas-guzzler roared by, and yet another patriot raised
a clenched fist at the peaceniks.</TE>
<TE>   "Strike Iraq!" he bellowed.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie, who hauls the protest signs around in the back of her
Toyota Prius gasoline-electric hybrid (48 mpg), doesn't doubt that
Saddam Hussein is a menace.</TE>
<TE>   But we don't seem to have a problem dealing with the oil-rich
Saudi devils who provided home and hearth to many of the Sept. 11
terrorists. And it's not much of a stretch to view war on Iraq as a
bombing-for-oil mission that would conveniently divert attention from
our own economic woes and fatten the energy barons and military
contractors who dictate public policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are outraged because they think if we're opposed to
war, we're somehow on the side of terrorism," said Bernstein.
"They'll shout out, 'Where were you on Sept. 11?' And, 'Don't you
care about all the people who died?' Of course we do, but we feel
that our grief is not assuaged by causing more death to innocent
people in other parts of the world."</TE>
<TE>   The jeers don't bother Bernstein, who says she hears even more
cheers. What gets under her skin is that the majority of people have
no reaction at all. The war won't even register with them until the
bombing is carried live on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "Ignorance is bliss. They really would prefer not to have to think
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The more apathetic the public, the more determined Bernstein
becomes. She'll pull an extra shift at Bush's Dana Point appearance
on Friday. And then she'll be back at her regular spot Saturday, a
protest sign in her hand, an American flag flying from her lawn
chair.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Park Planning Favors North</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Supervisors vote 3 to 2 to divide $16 million
in Prop. 12 funds across districts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to complaints that urban areas don't have enough
recreational areas, the Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to spend
most of the $16 million Orange County is receiving from a state bond
measure in northern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted 3 to 2 to divide the money evenly among the five
supervisorial districts, meaning that most of the windfall will be
spent north of the Costa Mesa Freeway. Supervisors rejected an
alternative that would have spent much of the money on southern
Orange County parks.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the county's regional and wilderness park acreage is in
South County, and some residents complained Tuesday that supervisors
need to look into expanding parks elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "It's unfair that Irvine and south areas have so much land
available for parks," said Fullerton resident Sandy Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Westminster Councilwoman Margie L. Rice added, "There are very
small parks in our city, and we are desperately in need of help to
build more."</TE>
<TE>   The park disparity was caused in large part by historic
development patterns in Orange County. Much of the north and central
county was developed piecemeal between the 1920s and 1970s, with
little land set aside for large-scale parks and open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   South County was built up over the past 30 years by a small group
of developers that controlled large swaths of land. These developers
forged agreements with county planners that set aside far more open
space--and wilderness land--for parks. South County has some of the
area's biggest parks, including Aliso &amp; Wood Canyons Wilderness Park
at 4,000 acres and O'Neill Regional Park at 3,100 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Though officials acknowledge the funding plan approved Tuesday
won't balance the scales, they hope it will help provide more
recreational facilities in North County.</TE>
<TE>   Residents urged the board to use funds to buy parkland in Coyote
Hills in Brea and help cities like Santa Ana convert grass soccer
fields into synthetic so they will last longer.</TE>
<TE>   One-Time Cash Infusion</TE>
<TE>   The $16 million in park funds was made available as a one-time
grant through Proposition 12, a state park bond act approved by
voters in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   South County open-space advocates saw it as an opportunity to pay
for $8 million in sewer projects at Irvine and O'Neill regional
parks.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, a volunteer organization,
and the Sierra Club recommended the funds be used for the South
County regional park projects.</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Chuck Smith, who represents some of the county's
most densely populated areas in Santa Ana and Westminster, argued
that the money should be distributed more equally.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposition said the bond money was for 'safe neighborhood
parks,' " Smith said. "It doesn't say 'county parks sewer systems.' "</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who represents portions of
Fullerton and Anaheim, agreed: "My constituents are begging for more
green space."</TE>
<TE>   Two Supervisors Dissent</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Jim Silva, however, argued that the county has a
responsibility to maintain the regional parks it has established,
even if many are in South County. They attract park users from
throughout the county. In addition, he said, if residents in northern
cities want more parks, they should lobby their city councils.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County cities received nearly $39 million, about 70% of
Proposition 12 funds received in the county, compared with only 30%
received by the county, Silva noted.</TE>
<TE>   Silva, who dissented along with Supervisor Tom Wilson, said he
believed the vote by the board symbolized a "wooden stake into the
regional park system."</TE>
<TE>   The county's park system was hard-hit by the 1994 bankruptcy,
which has prevented officials from making needed repairs and
renovations.</TE>
<TE>   About $4 million annually is drained from the county's Harbors,
Beaches and Parks budget to pay interest on more than $900 million in
bankruptcy debt.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Fegraus, Laguna Canyon Foundation executive director, had
urged the board to funnel the funds to South County, which would have
added about $900,000 for an interpretive center at Laguna Coast
Wilderness Park. The park is visited by residents from throughout the
County, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The park parity issue is not a new one. Irvine is seeking to
convert a large portion of the former El Toro Marine base into a
"Great Park." Coad this year sought to have Irvine provide some money
to boost North County parks, but her effort failed.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Parole Decisions Protested</HD>
<DH>Prisons: Marchers say he has wrongly rejected freedom for
many battered women who killed their abusers.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Demonstrators rallied in four California cities Tuesday to protest
Gov. Gray Davis' rejection of parole for many battered women who
killed their abusers.</LD>
<LD>   The protesters accused the governor of playing politics with the
lives of the inmates, who have been judged rehabilitated and approved
for release by the state parole board, whose members were appointed
by Davis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a travesty of justice," said Diana Block, who took part in
the Sacramento rally and represents the California Coalition for
Battered Women in Prison. "Any objective person who looked at these
women's records would agree they deserve to be freed."</LD>
<TE>   Critics say Davis, who is running for reelection, refuses to
release eligible convicts because he fears that a parolee might
commit a new crime and wind up in a campaign ad against him.</TE>
<TE>   But Byron Tucker, Davis' press secretary, disputed that
characterization, saying the governor acts with public safety--not
politics--in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor evaluates each case individually and on its merits,"
Tucker said. "He gives all of these cases a painstaking review. Some
of them meet his criteria, and some of these people are not deserving
of parole."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after taking office, Davis seemed to signal his intention
with regard to parole for convicted murderers, saying: "If you take
someone else's life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   His staff insists that the statement was political hyperbole. But
critics say the governor's record proves he meant what he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis took office, the state Board of Prison Terms has
recommended freedom for 123 convicted murderers. Davis has approved
parole for two--both of them battered women imprisoned for killing
their abusers. He has rejected parole for nine other women who the
board concluded committed their crimes because they were being
battered.</TE>
<TE>   That overall record makes Davis, a Democrat, far less forgiving
than his GOP predecessor, Pete Wilson. In Wilson's final three years
in office, he allowed more than two dozen convicted murderers to go
free on parole.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's rallies reflect the criticism that Davis has faced on a
number of fronts regarding his parole decisions--especially those
that involve battered women. The Legislature's women's caucus, for
example, has become increasingly active on the issue, lobbying Davis
on behalf of several women whose cases were before him.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure is coming from the courts as well. In a string of
decisions upholding inmates' legal challenges, judges have rebuked
Davis, suggesting that he follows a blanket, illegal policy against
parole rather than assessing the facts of each case.</TE>
<TE>   Two cases, both involving Los Angeles-area men serving terms for
second-degree murder, are before the state Supreme Court. Oral
arguments in those cases, which may decide the extent of the
governor's authority over parole, is expected next month.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sacramento, rallies were held in San Francisco, Los
Angeles and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The largest was in San Francisco, where about 100
people--including relatives of incarcerated women--gave speeches and
marched with signs on a downtown sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, about 60 protesters paraded on Spring Street near
the state office building for an hour before a small delegation went
inside to meet with the governor's staff.</TE>
<TE>   Those demonstrators, who delivered hundreds of letters urging
Davis to free the battered women, included Rose Ann Parker, one of
the two convicted killers the governor has released.</TE>
<TE>   In freeing Parker, Davis concluded that she acted out of fear for
her life and was a victim of battered women's syndrome when she
killed her ex-boyfriend in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The other woman cleared for parole by the governor was Cheryl
Sellers. Davis said that although she committed a grave crime when
she killed her husband as he lay in bed one night in 1983, she acted
in reaction to abuse and threats.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the rallies said there are dozens of other female
prisoners were victims of abuse before committing their crimes.
Earlier this month, Davis rejected parole for two women--Mary Ramp
and Flozelle Woodmore--who had been found to be victims of battered
women's syndrome and judged deserving of release by the parole board.</TE>
<TE>   One prisoner deserving freedom, protesters say, is Henrietta
Briones, 42, who killed her abusive boyfriend in 1986. The parole
board found her to be a victim of battered women's syndrome and
approved her release. But Davis reversed that decision earlier this
year, saying she remained a threat to society.</TE>

<LD>A trough of low pressure from the Pacific Northwest has created a
Catalina Eddy, a condition that usually drapes Southern California in
June Gloom. The eddy brings moist air ashore, and because of the bigger
difference between sea and land temperatures, more clou cover results.
Orange County should begin to see changes today, with earlier clearing
and warmer weather.</LD>
