<HD>The Scent of Danger Is Blowing in the Wind</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was up on the roof the other day sniffing the wind when I noticed
someone across the way also sniffing the wind. Later, down the block,
I saw a third person, a woman, on her roof sniffing the wind.</LD>
<LD>   The practice of wind-sniffing isn't another nutty Topanga ritual
having to do with ancient Chumash traditions, overflowing septic
tanks or efforts to contact alien spacecraft, although they are
frequently seen hovering over Joe's Market.</LD>
<LD>   Wind-sniffing is an event that occurs every fire season, which is
almost all the time these days, but it becomes absolutely necessary
when the heat is high, humidity low and fires are bursting out all
over. We're sniffing to determine if they're near.</LD>
<TE>   Experts tell us that this is the worst fire season since 1887 or
maybe 1961, depending on which expert is speaking, due to the driest
rainy season since then. Not that we are blase about this, but we are
told almost every year that we are in the midst of the worst fire
season since (fill in a date here).</TE>
<TE>   When the storms of El Nino raked the Southland, experts warned
that because of the rapid growth of everything that grows, the
following year would be the worst fire season on record. That's
because everything that grows also dries, creating more fire fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Due to the confusion of those who predict things like rain, fire
and winners at the Kentucky Derby, we are always on the alert in the
Santa Monica Mountains, tucked in, as we are, among grass and
chaparral and trees that explode like tiki torches.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us live in all-wood houses, and some even have shake
roofs, both of which are almost as dangerous in a fire season as
living in one of those grass shacks in certain parts of Botswana.</TE>
<TE>   I mention this today because fires are beginning to break out in
various parts of Southern California. Los Angeles, Riverside,
Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties have already smelled the smoke
and heard sirens screaming like women in peril through their hills
and their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   One observer described a fire just south of Riverside by saying
that moments after it began, "It shot up like a blowtorch."</TE>
<TE>   That's an accurate description of many brush fires which, given
the right conditions, suddenly explode into flames and roar through
hills and homes, dwarfing the efforts of the men and equipment we
throw into the fight against them.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a great admirer of firefighters and always have been, even
before their heroics at the World Trade Center. I've seen them walk
into billows of smoke so dense that only the twisting reds and
yellows of the fire itself were visible. And I've seen them stand in
the face of the flames, pouring water on a monster that seemed almost
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Fire is high drama, involving all of the senses at the same time.
It roars, crackles and explodes against the background of sirens, the
whomp-whomp-whomp of helicopters overhead and the growl of air
tankers skimming over the burning hills.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is mesmerizing theater for those who stop to stare at
flames as high as heaven coming toward them through the rolling
clouds of smoke, creating their own storms, demanding the land and
all that occupies it.</TE>
<TE>   Wind-sniffers can never forget the firestorms of 1993 that burned
1,241 structures and 197,225 acres of trees and brush in Southern
California, killing three people in Topanga who tried to outrun or
outthink the blast-furnace flames.</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires roared from the valley to the sea with incredible speed,
turning much of Malibu into heaps of charred debris where homes had
once stood, leaving only chimneys, stone walls and soot-blackened
swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Riordan, that foolish man, stood in Pacific Palisades, where
the southern edge of the fire had been stopped, and grinned his great
pleasure at the fact that it had not burned into the city of Los
Angeles, while the rest of the hills were in flames. One wonders
occasionally why God, who gave New York Rudy Giuliani, has saddled
L.A. with the Riordans and the Little Jimmy Hahns.</TE>
<TE>   It was after I had watched television reports of fires burning
throughout Southern California the other day that I climbed onto the
roof where it dips almost to the ground, and sniffed the air for the
wind-drifted aroma of burning wood. I saw others doing the same, and
there we stood like aging sentinels in a battleground of hard
memories. As I looked around, I flashed back to that day nine years
ago when flames clawed over ridgelines to the west and bore down on
us with teeth bared. I remember standing there with a garden hose,
embers falling around me, and thinking how pathetic I was against so
awesome a force of nature.</TE>
<TE>   Why live in an area susceptible to wildfires? For nights as
peaceful as Eden. For the morning mist that creeps over the hills and
into the canyons. For the howl of a coyote and the hoot of an owl.
All those things and more. Life is a constant trade-off. Peril for
peace, months of serenity for a few days of terror.</TE>
<TE>   So I sniff the wind. I watch the ridgelines. I listen for sirens.
And I wait.</TE>

<LD>WISH YOU WERE HERE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Stewart O'Nan</LD>
<TE>   Grove Press</TE>
<TE>   518 pages; $25</TE>
<TE>   Stewart O'Nan built his reputation on novels that temper the
creepy paranoia of early Stephen King with a Dostoevsky-esque
approach to character development. Fast-paced, suspenseful and
claustrophobic, O'Nan's novels--including "The Speed Queen" and "A
Prayer for the Dying"--pivot on complicated moral questions,
life-or-death matters rooted in the irresolvable depths of his
characters' histories.</TE>
<TE>   When they're not off getting themselves killed, the fleet of
troubled misfits who populate these books are busy knocking off other
unfortunates or obsessing over the deaths that occur in their
vicinity. For O'Nan, American films and novels, filled as they are
with bloody and unspeakable acts, reflect "our real lives," he once
wrote in an essay. Violence is nothing extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest novel, however, O'Nan seems to have heeded the cries
of those who lament the brutality that permeates pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Eschewing both the violence and the labyrinthine plotting of the
early novels, "Wish You Were Here" offers a stark and brilliantly
mesmerizing glimpse into the lives of the Maxwells, the most
aggressively average American family this side of "The Corrections."
OK, there's a slaying (really a disappearance), but it's relegated to
the background.</TE>
<TE>   The real meat of the matter is the obscenely dull stuff of daily
life: sandwiches, laundry, weather, car rides. Not since Jane Austen
has a writer devoted so many words to the minutiae of a card game.</TE>
<TE>   The Maxwells have gathered for a week of inner tubing and
bickering at their summer cottage on Lake Chautauqua, a resort area
that hit its prime sometime around 1880. Likewise, the Maxwells
themselves have seen better days.</TE>
<TE>   One year prior, Henry, the "steady and stoic" patriarch, died
quietly in a Pittsburgh hospital, leaving the cottage to his fussy,
abrasive wife, Emily. Like Franzen's Enid Lambert, Emily is a mix of
Depression-era stinginess and provincial small-mindedness who can't
quite adjust to the accoutrements of 21st century life.</TE>
<TE>   Confused by self-adhesive stamps, fast-food restaurants and
digital animation, she's utterly baffled by her two grown children,
Meg and Ken, who allow their kids to drink Kool-Aid for breakfast and
play video games day and night.</TE>
<TE>   Equally exasperated with their mother's endless nitpicking, Meg
and Ken have sorrows that go beyond their father's recent death. Not
long out of rehab, Meg smokes dope daily--"[a]t first she'd thought
marijuana maintenance was an AA joke"--when she's not sobbing about
her imminent divorce (her husband left her for a young blond) or
snapping at her kids, Sarah, a 13-year-old seductress, and Justin,
too timid and frightened for his 10 years. Ken, "the good son," has
quit his company job for an $8.50-per-hour gig at a photo lab, which
will allow him to focus on his photography. (That his wages allow
Ken, his wife Lisa and kids Ella and Sam to live in Cambridge, Mass.,
adds an absurdist touch to this neo-realist novel.) Of course, he's
so worried about money that he can't pick up his Nikon without
second-guessing his aesthetic instincts.</TE>
<TE>   As Emily tried to shelter Meg and Ken from the gravity of their
father's illness, so do they attempt to hide their own problems and
embarrassments from her. Of course, as the week wears on, Meg and Ken
spill. And Emily has her own secret--the reason she's decided to sell
the Maxwell cottage, despite the objections of her children and
Arlene, Henry's spinster sister. She feels that Emily has no right to
the family house.</TE>
<TE>   Structured around the passage of time--rather than a conventional
narrative arc--"Wish You Were Here" is divided into seven sections,
one for each day of the family's week. Each section contains a number
of short chapters, which follow the characters as they go about their
business: Sarah develops a crush on a neighborhood boy, while her
cousin Ella falls hard for Sarah, struggling not to kiss her as the
two lie in adjoining sleeping bags. Ten-year-old Sam, a budding
sociopath, taunts sweet, gentle Justin. Arlene and Meg trade
confidences and smokes. Ken prowls around with his camera, fixating
on a local girl who's been kidnapped from the gas station where she
worked. Emily worries over garbage pick-ups and breakfast dishes. And
Lisa--barely tolerant of the family's "annual melodramas"--does her
best to avoid Emily, hiding with one of the kids' Harry Potter books
and contemplating life's dullness, having "nothing to occupy her mind
but their problems--common enough, and stultifying, since she saw no
improvement ahead, let alone real solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The joy of the novel--and O'Nan's triumph--is the subtle manner in
which the alternating voices draw in the reader. You read on less to
find out what happens to the Maxwells (there's really no question;
their fates are fixed in stone), than to become better acquainted
with the characters, whom O'Nan makes fascinating and familiar. Here
are "our real lives." Yet the dismal deaths in his previous books
somehow seem less brutal than the slow, measured psychological
violence the Maxwells inflict upon each other--violence all the more
insidious for being meted out in the name of familial love. What
could be more average than that?</TE>

<LD>Native Plants</LD>
<LD>   Spring is the time of year when natives wake up and bloom.</LD>
<LD>   Natives are hearty plants that thrive in the dry, warm climate of
Southern California. They grow on hills and canyons and on the sides
of roads, and they don't depend on gardeners to feed and water them.
Natives are experts at conserving water to get them through a dry,
hot summer.</LD>
<TE>   Some natives have thick, leathery leaves that hold in water for
the dry months ahead. Some have long roots that reach water
underground. Some turn brown and look dead during summer, only to
wake up again after the first winter rains. Natives especially like
spring, when many of them produce bright flowers in shades of gold,
yellow, orange, blue and pink.</TE>
<TE>   Poppies are colorful natives that grow in abundance this time of
year. One relative of the poppy is our state flower, the Eschscholzia
californica, which we all call the California poppy. This pretty
plant has golden, four-petaled blossoms that open wide and face the
sun on bright days but close up on overcast days or at night.
California poppies are 8 to 24 inches tall and have delicate,
blue-green stems and leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Matilija poppies are giants by comparison. They grow 8 feet tall
and have big white flowers that look like fried eggs.</TE>
<TE>   You can see these colorful poppies and many other plants at the
California Native Garden in Descanso Gardens. For more information
call (818) 949-4200 or visit www.DescansoGardens. org.</TE>
<TE>   This Learning Link was provided by Descanso Gardens, 1418 Descanso
Drive, La Canada Flintridge, near the intersection of the 2 and 210

<HD>Lakers' Ceiling Fans</HD>
<DH>The higher the row, the more uninhibited the team's
devotees.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They came. They saw. They watched from the upper terrace, Section
319, a dozen rows from the back wall, as the Lakers conquered the San
Antonio Spurs, 93-87, on Tuesday night, advancing to the Western
Conference finals against the Sacramento Kings. And now Annette
Toledo ("as in 'holy,'" she said) and her friend Mary Gallardo were
ready to turn their attention to more pressing issues.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to see Rick Fox naked!" yelled Gallardo, a criminology
student at Cal State Northridge with an unabashed love jones for the
Lakers' ultra-suave forward. Toledo, looking chic in a wig made of
purple tinsel, had a more circumspect view of the respective merits
of the Lakers' starting lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "We also have to give credit to the other guys too; Shaq, Kobe,"
Toledo said. "We want to give 'em their props." Gallardo was having
none of it. "I want to see Rick Fox naked," she pouted. "She wants to
see him naked," Toledo affirmed. Oh.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't the sort of observation you tend to hear in the lower,
pricier echelons of the Staples Center, where waiters scurry about
serving Chardonnay and chocolate cake, and the fans are so polite
they sometimes don't remember to stand up until the fourth quarter of
a tie game--provided they're not cutting three-picture deals on their
cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   But here in the nosebleeds, almost anything goes. Passions seem to
run higher as you ascend the escalators past the luxury boxes. The
number of gold chains and pierced noses per capita goes up
exponentially. An informal camaraderie takes possession of people
waving banners instead of valet parking passes and tossing off
unfiltered opinions, not air kisses. Especially these days, as the
Lakers hunt for their third consecutive NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   "You're sitting with the real fans up here," said Jose Azucena,
26, a professional body piercer who works at In the Skin Tattoos in
Pasadena. "These are the loyal fans that buy the cheap seats. All
those others are corporate-owned."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, blue-collar solidarity is a relative sentiment when
you're paying $47.50 per ticket. Knothole gangs and the idea of
sports as the working stiff's refuge from dog-eat-dog daily life
pretty much went out with 50-cent beers.</TE>
<TE>   But the territorial imperative of upper-tier seating is never to
be taken lightly. From the dingiest small-town ballpark to the most
lavish, state-of-the-art athletic palace in a major metropolis, the
"cheap" seats (or what passes for them nowadays) are where fans still
go to let their hair down and their inhibitions out.</TE>
<TE>   And in an epoch of ever-rising ticket prices and social
stratification, upper-level seating may be the one place where
ordinary fans can feel at home among the dot-com millionaires and the
famous people in expensive eyewear who make up a good chunk of
contemporary pro sports audiences. "I've sat three rows from the
bottom, and I think this is much more wild than the bottom," said
Rosanne Menez, 22, who'd come to the game with her friend Azucena.
"You get to be yourself, get to enjoy the game," said Marcus Dixon of
Long Beach, juggling a tray of margaritas as he paused to shout
encouragement at the  figures dribbling and shooting far below--as
abstract and remote, at times, as GameBoy dots.</TE>
<TE>   At some sports arenas, the cheap seats areas are famous for
developing their own unique rituals. These are practically an art
form among the bleacher bums of Chicago's Wrigley Field, who like to
sun themselves in the outfield while making disparaging and usually
well-deserved remarks about the home team's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing that colorful exists in the upper confines of Staples
Center--an inverted pyramid, like most modern sports complexes, where
the elite are treated like pashas and the hoi polloi are tucked away
at an altitude normally reserved for pigeons and police helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples, the social strata are as cleanly delineated as in
Robert Altman's "Gosford Park," and the upper seating decks are so
steeply raked (to make room for all those luxury suites) that,
looking straight down, you can feel like Jimmy Stewart in "Vertigo."</TE>
<TE>   But the benefits of sitting higher speak for themselves, partisans
say, not the least of which is privacy. Let the beautiful people mug
for the TV monitors. Leah Perroti was quite happy to be watching the
game decked out in a yellow and purple Afro wig, matching Mardi Gras
beads and a Lakers jersey as she sat with her husband, John, in the
tippy-top row of section 315.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to write that, are you?!" said Perroti, a Los
Angeles elementary school principal. Her students know that she likes
the Lakers, Perroti said, "but they don't know I dress up like this."
Actually, Perroti and her husband, who've been attending Laker games
since the 1970s, seemed not to care much who knew. "You know how L.A.
gets the bad rap for not getting excited?" Leah Perroti asked. "Well,
we get pretty excited up here." Added John: "And we can stand up and
not be standing in front of somebody."</TE>
<TE>   So that means they wouldn't trade places with Jack Nicholson,
right? Well, ah, maybe. The couple has thought about upgrading their
seats, to get a few rows closer to the action. "The hardest part"
about sitting high up, said Leah Perroti, is that it takes a while to
get on the escalators after the game ends because you have to wait
for the people in the lower sections. "We take the stairs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For some top-tier fans, Tuesday's game seemed almost beside the
point. Jeff Gates and Gary Brooks, who'd driven in from Claremont,
were in no big hurry to take their seats, choosing to spend most of
the first quarter eating greasy meat sandwiches at the City View
Grill on the outdoor upper deck adjacent to the cheap seats.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, who vaguely resembles the actor Brian Dennehy, said he dug
the view of the downtown L.A. skyline, its facades resplendent in the
twilight. But he did have one concern.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, dude? I thought that being in L.A. they'd have
[TV] screens out here," he said, gesturing toward a wall above a
series of multiple double doors. "Dude, if I ran this place we'd have
a screen right here."</TE>
<TE>   Truth to tell, you wouldn't have missed much excitement if you
watched the game's first two periods on television. Falling behind
early on, the Lakers played just well enough to hang close to the
Spurs, trailing by six at halftime. Taking their cues from the
players, the fans kept their enthusiasm in check. Only one banner
flailed in the air in Section 304, while a single pompom was waved in
306.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Lakers snatched the lead in the third period, the
clapping and whooping rose through the rafters like thunder. Banners
and signs sprouted like Himalayan wildflowers. Chants of "Three-peat!
Three-peat!" drifted out toward the concessions areas. When Robert
Horry sank a three-pointer with 56.2 seconds left, it was all over
but the shouting--lots of shouting, with the cheap seats leading the
way. "The people are just louder up here," said usher Lakeisha
Johnson, fighting to make herself heard above the din ricocheting
down from the roof.</TE>
<TE>   Like L.A., Staples may be a house divided. But every few years,
for a few weeks in early summer, the Lakers become the great leveler.
Down in the locker room, Horry was facing a battery of microphones
and cameras, assessing the Lakers' chances against the red-hot Kings,
whom they meet Saturday in Sacramento. "We're going to go in there
and quiet them down," he said softly.</TE>
<TE>   Good, Robert, good. Just don't expect quiet from Section 319
anytime soon.</TE>

<LD>On Saturday, a new perspective on downtown Los Angeles will be on
display, free to the public. This block party/intellectual exercise
titled "Downtown L.A.: Where Design Hits the Road" is intended to
change people's view of the area as a wasteland by showing many of
the new developments, as well as the possibilities for the future.
The event is centered in the area south of Main Street near Traction
Avenue and Merrick Street.</LD>
<LD>   "I was sitting around with some of the downtown storeowners
talking about how clueless people were about what is happening
downtown," says Ann Gray, publisher of Balcony Press and L.A.
Architect magazine, the sponsor of what is hoped will become an
annual event. "There are lots of design studios, major and emerging
architectural firms and furniture showrooms moving into the area. And
loft spaces are being turned into artists' studios."</LD>
<TE>   Gray believes that Los Angeles is a center for good design,
especially with what is happening downtown. "Behind many of the
hideous facades on Traction Avenue, there's a great creative energy,"
she says. On Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Traction and other
nearby streets can be explored in self-directed walking tours, with
architects, artists, furniture showrooms and others holding open
houses. There will be booths for exhibitors, including a Hennessey +
Ingalls booth, which will have book-signings throughout the day by
authors with books relating to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth a visit is the Form Zero bookstore at 811 Traction
Ave., which carries more than 10,000 books and magazines on
architecture, photography and typography and has a reading area with
Wassily chairs designed by Marcel Breuer. The House of Blues is
supplying five bands for entertainment; food is by Ciudad and Border
Grill restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The tours will extend to other parts of downtown, as well.
Docent-lead bus tours will take off every 15 minutes to transport
people to key projects. "We'll show new developments and new lofts as
well as historic properties," some with stops so people can leave the
bus for a tour, says Tara Jones, president of Historic Consultants,
preservation consultants of loft conversion projects. Highlights
include Little Tokyo, Disney Hall and the 1915 Victor Clothing
Building on 242 S. Broadway that's being converted into 38 live/work
lofts, as well as Broadway movie palaces, the Department of Water and
Power building and DWP solar installations, and the new Architecture
and Design Museum at the Bradbury Building at 304 S. Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have goodie bags with information about downtown, because
our goal is to get people to come back," says Jones.</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the event, a series of panel discussions will
be held at SCI-Arc, 350 Merrick St. Topics include "City on the
Verge: What's the Plan for Downtown," at 1:30 p.m. moderated by Dan
Rosenfeld, a principal in Urban Partners, LLC; And at 3:30 p.m.,
Larry Scarpa, principal of Pugh &amp; Scarpa Architects and founder of
Livable Places, a developer of inner-city housing, will moderate a
panel discussion on architects as developers titled "Rewriting the
Rules: The Architect's Role in Shaping Projects."</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, contractors and developers control how our cities
look," Scarpa says. "Architects are now used only as designers. That
isn't the way it used to be. It's time that design professionals get
more involved in shaping our communities." Livable Places seeks to
provide affordable, sustainable housing for urban areas. "As an
architect, I've always been interested in housing, but we hope to
provide an alternate model to what's currently available. We don't
want to dictate style or have gated communities, and we want to use
in-fills instead of raw land to build on."</TE>
<TE>   Architects, Scarpa says, are no longer trying to design cool
doors, but now want to design cool communities. And downtown L.A. is
where many plan to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   An architects' contest to design a Teen Park will have as judges
teenage art students from Art Share Los Angeles, a downtown community
arts facility. Current Art Share programs focus on providing
after-school activities for at-risk teens in the inner city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge collaborative event," says L.A. Architect
publisher Gray. "We want to open up the public's eyes to what's
happening here."</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown LA: Where Design Hits the Road" is Saturday from 11
a.m.-5 p.m. at Traction Avenue between 3rd and Merrick Streets. Free
parking is at SCI-Arc, 960 E. 3rd. St. For additional information,
check the Web site at www.laarch.com/designwalk.html. or call L.A.
Architect at (818) 956-5313.</TE>

<TE>   On Saturday and Sunday the Art Furnishings Show, now in its fourth
year, will again showcase one-of-a-kind and limited-edition studio
furniture and art furnishings. More than 100 exhibitors, including
artists and craftsmen from throughout the United States, will be on
hand to show their works and talk to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Local artists include Los Angeles' Stephen Courtney, who designs
modern, sleek furniture, usually in wood. "Mine are useful objects of
art designed to enrich, to elevate the living experience," he says.
L.A.'s Meredith Sattler has an entirely different take on
furniture-making, since under the business name of cambioform, she
constructs "pure pieces" by working mainly with birch plywood. She
leaves the wood bare, not covering plywood edges with veneer or
edge-band.</TE>
<TE>   From Pasadena, Cindy Vargas' furniture is playful and shows her
interest in choreography as some of the chairs seem to be dancing.
Long Beach's John Nyquist has been crafting furniture for more than
30 years, and his classic designs for rocking chairs are timeless.
Glass is represented by Kent Kahlen of Orange, who does glass
sculptures as well as light fixtures and doorknobs.</TE>
<TE>   Garden accessories, floor coverings, lighting and more also will
be on view.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Center Exhibition Hall, 300 E. Green St., Pasadena.
Saturday 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; Sunday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Admission is $8. For
information, call (805) 778-1584 or check the Web site at

<DH>Ilyasah Shabazz's new book delves into her life as the
child of Malcolm X</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN TEXEIRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In her mind, Ilyasah Shabazz's father is a montage of blurry, black
and white photographs and grainy newsreel. She did not know the man
that some called a savior and some called a devil. She did not know
the sound of his voice, the feel of his hair, the look of his hands.
To find him for herself, she has to navigate through other people's
memories. She must try to locate her family's truth in the shifting
albums of history.</LD>
<LD>   Now Shabazz, who was 2 when her father, Malcolm X, was
assassinated more than 37 years ago, is offering her stories to the
world in an intimate look inside her family. Her memoir, "Growing Up
X" (One World Books), picks up the family's story where history books
and political analyses of the Muslim leader who preached black
empowerment leave off. It is an up-close portrait of the house full
of girls to whom the larger-than-life activist came home each night:
the family that basked in his light when he lived, the family that
struggled, often alone, when he was gone. In many ways, their
struggle continues today.</LD>
<LD>   Shabazz, 39, said she wrote the book partly hoping it would
inspire others who are struggling with life challenges. But she also
called it "therapeutic" to revisit the events of her life--and, in
particular, to try to make her peace with the expectations that she
has faced for as long as she can remember.</LD>
<TE>   "The expectation is the burden--the burden! Here you have great
parents, and now you're expected to be better than, or to be them!"
she said. "It's awful, it is awful. It just tears you up inside."</TE>
<TE>   She has finally learned, she said, that she "cannot save the
world. Just let it go, let it go."</TE>
<TE>   The book's cover photograph depicts an image at once commonplace
and incongruous--Shabazz as a toddler held affectionately in the arms
of the man the FBI, the CIA and, eventually, the Nation of Islam
reviled. She wears a baby bonnet; he sports his trademark goatee and
horn-rimmed glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing Up X" tells of a childhood that was simultaneously
average--she and her five sisters attended private schools in
suburban Westchester County, N.Y., and square-danced at summer camp
in Vermont--and unique--at age 9, she began challenging teachers on
the facts of black history and, as a college student, she absorbed
her classmates' harsh judgments because she was not a political
activist.</TE>
<TE>   As hinted at in the family's public scuffle in recent weeks over
the threatened auction of Malcolm X's personal papers, Shabazz's
story reflects the ongoing, personal reverberations of one man's
political journey and his violent death. It is a story of
perseverance in the wake of bitter loss.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which relies on the accounts of family friends to fill
in details Shabazz was too young to remember, reflects the burdens,
confusions and joys that often befall the children of famous people.
But Shabazz's story has an added dimension in that, unlike the child
of a film star or sports champion, she must negotiate the volatile
terrain of racial politics.</TE>
<TE>   For much of his political career, Malcolm X, who later took the
name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, vilified American culture and values
and promoted the separation of blacks and whites because, he said,
whites were incapable of living equally with blacks. In the last
years of his life, however, having made a religious pilgrimage abroad
and observing people of all colors living harmoniously, his attitudes
shifted. He increasingly stressed black empowerment and the common
bonds of all races.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in recognizing every human being as a human
being--neither white, black, brown, or red," Malcolm X told an
interviewer a month before he was killed, according to "The
Autobiography of Malcolm X," which he wrote with Alex Haley.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, Shabazz unveiled her book at a reception here in
Harlem. Despite the swank environment complete with jazz band and
hovering waiters, the scene had the echoes of grim history: Shabazz
has lived as long as her father did--he was 39 when he died--and the
book event was held at the Audubon Ballroom, where he spoke his last
words.</TE>
<TE>   "Malcolm was killed right about ... here," said Manning Marable, a
historian at Columbia University, gesturing in the direction of the
jazz band. "There was a stage here. He was standing, speaking. They
came in from over there," he said, indicating the room's only
entrance 65 feet away. The men scuffled and yelled to distract from
the gunmen who shot him 14 times. (Two Nation of Islam members served
prison time for the murder.)</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz, a tall woman with mahogany skin, her father's square jaw
and a fashion model's presence (she once was one), stood before a
massive mural depicting her father's life and, in her deep, smoky
voice, told the crowd of about 300, "Coming to the Audubon, there was
so much beautiful energy here. I felt so much peace."</TE>
<TE>   After the event, she said the place "doesn't have negative meaning
for me. My father gave his life for a cause. I can't live [thinking],
'Why me? Why us? Why did he have to go?' The bottom line is this is
what's happened. So how do we live, how do we grow? What's the
purpose, what's the point of it all?"</TE>
<TE>   Although she grew up much like a typical suburban child, life
after her father's assassination was, Shabazz writes, in many ways
excruciating. A year before his death, Malcolm had split rancorously
with the Nation of Islam. A week before the killing, the family's
house had been firebombed. When he died, the family had no home and
no support from the religious community they had relied on for years.
Malcolm had $600 in his bank account.</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Times," Shabazz writes, "editorialized him as 'a
twisted man' who turned 'true gifts to evil purpose.'" When a
prominent friend helped them find a home in suburban Mount Vernon,
N.Y., many in the conservative, black middle-class community clearly
did not want them living down the street. Shabazz, who works as
public information officer for the city of Mount Vernon, rarely tells
new acquaintances who her father was.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the Shabazz daughters--including Attallah, Qubilah and
Gamilah and twins Malikah and Malaak--joined local social
organizations and attended college. Today, some, including Ilyasah,
have advanced degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz's book sometimes reads more like a loving memorial to her
mother than anything else. Indeed, though she had some prominent
benefactors such as Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, and Sidney Poitier, the
late Betty Shabazz managed the seemingly unmanageable, raising six
girls and getting her PhD at the same time. She became a professor
and college administrator and was long a revered activist in and
around New York. Shabazz says her mother insulated her family from
the world, including the media.</TE>
<TE>   But she never discussed the assassination--the facts of the day or
her feelings--and she did not seem to encourage her children to
reflect on their feelings about it. There were no therapy sessions,
no books on death and grieving. Betty Shabazz spoke reverently of her
late husband--in the present tense. "Malcolm says ... " and "Malcolm
thinks...."</TE>
<TE>   So, although pictures of Malcolm filled the house and the
"Autobiography" was a constant presence, the girls' upbringing seemed
to have been marked by a persistent silence and, beneath that,
unresolved grief. That silence prompted Shabazz, once in college, to
read the "Autobiography," visit her father's grave for the first time
and take a course on him.</TE>
<TE>   It was at once a difficult and exhilarating experience for her,
Shabazz said. "It was this professor," she wrote, "who helped me
really understand my father's philosophy and his enormous
contributions to our people and to humankind." When the professor,
who did not reveal Shabazz's identity to the class, asked who among
them would be ready for the revolution, she wrote, "all hands shot
up, as did mine."</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine how [that history] impacted her and the rest of them,"
said Terrie Williams, a lifelong family friend and founder of the New
York-based Stay Strong Foundation for troubled youth. "It's
extraordinary that this woman was able to get this story out, because
this family is in a lot of pain."</TE>
<TE>   That pain erupted again in 1995 when second-oldest daughter
Qubilah Shabazz was arrested on charges of plotting to kill Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan because she believed he played a role in
the death of her father. (Farrakhan, once a protege of Malcolm's, has
never been linked to the killing.) Charges were dropped when she
agreed to counseling and substance-abuse treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Qubilah's troubled son, Malcolm, then 12, unhappy
that he had been sent to live with his grandmother in New York, set
fire to Betty Shabazz's home while she slept. The matriarch suffered
burns over 80% of her body and died three weeks later. Malcolm
pleaded guilty to the juvenile equivalent of second-degree
manslaughter and second-degree arson and was in detention until
recently. Now 17, he still struggles with behavior problems but has
completed high school and lives with Ilyasah in New York, she said.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the family, though intensely media-shy, has been in
the news again, this time in connection with the handling of their
father's papers--including historically valuable diaries, speeches
and letters to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   News reports indicated that Malikah Shabazz, unbeknownst to her
sisters, took the papers when she moved from the family's Mount
Vernon home to Florida in 1999. She stored them in a rented locker
but fell behind on the rent payments, and the papers were sold. The
family became aware that the papers were missing when an auction
house in San Francisco publicized the upcoming sale. (Butterfields
canceled the sale after receiving a letter from the family's attorney
that raised questions about the chain of ownership of the documents.
The auction house arranged the transfer of the papers to the
Schomburg Institute, a branch of the New York Public Library
dedicated to African American research.)</TE>
<TE>   The family now is working with Marable, a Malcolm X scholar and
director of Columbia's Institute for Research in African-American
Studies, on a project that will archive and annotate the facts of
Malcolm's life. They are also working to launch a historical center
at the Audubon Ballroom, which Shabazz said she hopes will be in
operation before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters don't seem to be close. They live in various states
throughout the country, with Attallah on the West Coast. Though
Shabazz admits tension arose among them over the handling of her
mother's medical care after the fire, she recently said tersely,
"Everyone is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Through her family's turmoil, past and present, Ilyasah Shabazz
has recovered and, in many ways, flourished. She is now working on a
book about her parents' relationship, due out next year.</TE>
<TE>   As her mother often instructed, Shabazz has found a way to "find
the good, and praise it."</TE>
<TE>   Ilyasah Shabazz will read from "Growing Up X" tonight at EsoWon
bookstore at 3655 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. For more information,
call (323) 294-0324.</TE>

<HD>This Sale's Nothing Short of Succulent</HD>
<DH>Looking for just the right plant? Event at Huntington will
have 10,000 of them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Railroad magnate Henry Huntington would be pleased with the gardens
he began planting in 1903 on what he called "the ranch." As the
gardens at Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens
in San Marino prepare to celebrate their 100th anniversary, the
historical, older sections are being dusted off and restored,
including a 3-acre chunk of the venerable desert garden, closed since
the Depression.</LD>
<LD>   A dramatic new 16,000-square-foot glass conservatory--patterned
after an elaborate lath house from Huntington's time--now rises to 38
feet as it becomes the latest addition to the year-old botanical
center with its children's garden, teaching greenhouses, research
areas and botanical library. The conservatory, still under
construction, won't open for another year and a half.</LD>
<LD>   The ambitious 12-acre Chinese garden begins construction this
summer with the digging of a new lake. Just north of the Japanese
garden, it's not slated to be finished until 2004.</LD>
<TE>   There's even a spacious new growing area in a distant corner of
the gardens for plants raised for the Huntington's various plant
sales. The new home is behind the botanical center, "just before the
coyotes bite you," as Shirley Kerins put it. She organizes all of the
sales, including the big annual May benefit event, which returns
Sunday after a year's hiatus. For many avid gardeners, this may be
the best news of all.</TE>
<TE>   From its humble beginnings in the early 1970s, when a few extra
plants were sold each year from card tables near the entrance, the
event has become almost legendary and it could be said the sales have
shaped the course of gardening in Southern California. Countless
plants that are today common were first seen by many at past sales.
Many gardeners can point to favorite plants in their gardens that
were discovered at this spring sale, including dozens in my garden.</TE>
<TE>   Kerins and her volunteer crew scour the state for interesting and
unusual plants. This year, they found plants from Northern California
all the way down to San Diego County. In addition, the sale includes
plants grown in the greenhouses and others dug up, when clumps grow
too large, from the Huntington's grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers bring wagons and carts to the sale, which they use to
haul plants to the checkout area, a practice that is highly
recommended since it's difficult to carry more than a few without
one. There are volunteer experts to help answer questions about
plants and this year's checkout will be able to take credit cards
(they finally have electricity), which might worry a few spouses
(including mine). Some shoppers have been known to pay $60 to join
the Huntington just so they can get in a day early to the
members-only sale, held on Saturday this year. (They'll let you join
at the sale entrance on that day--clever, huh?) The sale is being
held at its traditional location in the partially covered employee
parking lot next to the main lot. There is no entrance fee since it
is held outside the admission area. Sale proceeds benefit the garden.</TE>
<TE>   People begin arriving early. While waiting in line for the opening
bell, clever shoppers study the maps of the sale that are posted
nearby, so they can zoom in and load up on favorites. Certain
collectible plants get their own areas while most landscape plants
are arranged in a color wheel with banners that designate the flower
or leaf color--an orange flag for orange flowers, for instance,
silver for silver foliage.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kerins took over the sale in the early 1980s, there has
always been a theme. This year's "Weird and Wonderful Magical and
Mystical Plants," sounds suspiciously like an old Beatles album but
pays homage to recent movies about magic and fantasy. Nearly 10,000
plants will be available, but there are seldom more than 20 of any
one plant. "We don't have a lot of any one thing," Kerins said. She
is more interested in providing variety. "We really want people to
learn more about plants and their amazing diversity," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The theme plants are grouped together so they are easy to find.
There will be all sorts of plants with magical pasts or that are
"weird, twisted or curly," said Kerins, from voodoo lilies, eerily
black callas and corkscrew camellias to carrion flowers that smell as
bad as the Huntington's notoriously newsworthy Amorphophallus
titanum. In fact, you'll be able to buy a smaller version of
amorphophallus named 'Konjac'--suitable for pot culture--which, when
it flowers, will presumably be just as stinky. In the meantime it has
handsomely spotted stems and very tropical leaves. Quite a few
tropical-looking plants will be at the sale, from bananas to bamboo.</TE>
<TE>   In the large succulent and cactus area, overseen by curator John
Trager, there is a selection of jade plant, named Crassula ovata
'Gollum' (for the character in the "Lord of the Rings" tales), with
strangely quilled leaves that resemble frog toes, as well as many
other fascinating collectibles, such as the snaky and spinney
Cleistocactus paraguariensis, which has orange flowers followed by
bright magenta fruit, or the remarkably hairy woolly torch cactus
(Pilosocereus). There will also be landscape-size specimens of
succulent plants dug up and brought in from Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   One strange plant is called the ant plant because in its native
Africa certain kinds of ants live in its fat, foot-wide, swollen
base. A mature plant can be admired but baby ant plants, with bases
the size of marbles, will be sold.</TE>
<TE>   On the magical side will be dragon trees (Dracaena draco) and even
dried leaves from this strange plant that has a resinous sap the
color of blood. Dragon trees, thought in ancient times to be the
largest plants on Earth, are steeped in myth and legend. A new
addition to the sale is an area called "dried plants parts," which
will feature stems, fruits and inflorescences (flowers complete with
stem) suitable for arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   There are many more plants for shady gardens this year since "we
keep hearing people say that their gardens are getting shadier and
shadier," said Kerins. Dick Malott, a retired Van Nuys English
teacher, has put together an amazing selection of his new passion,
shade-loving begonias, and can--naturally--wax poetic on the subject.
"There's nothing like the enthusiasm of a new convert," Kerins said
with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest groups of theme plants are those with black
flowers or foliage, which are not truly black but extremely dark
shades of purple or maroon. Kerins and crew have found quite a
selection and she is particularly enamored of these plants because
she finds them so dramatic in the landscape. "By themselves, they are
simply interesting," said Kerins, who is also a landscape architect.
But combine and contrast them with other colors "and they make a
garden really special."</TE>
<TE>   One of her favorites is the black-flowered hollyhock but she also
likes the dark little ajuga called 'Chocolate Chip.' She has many
black plants for the perennial garden, from a dianthus named 'Sooty'
to a corydalis with dark purple leaves to an odd columbine named
'Chocolate Soldier.' One of the most dramatic is Salvia discolor,
which contrasts black tubular flowers against a silvery calyx and
foliage. While one or two of these plants may be most dramatic, it is
tempting to plant an entire garden of dark flowers or foliage,
starting with camellia 'Midnight Magic' and working down to black
mondo grass. An impressive list of sample sale plants is on the
Huntington Web site, www.hun tington.org.</TE>
<TE>   Annual plant sale 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Huntington
Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, 1151 Oxford Road, San
Marino. Members-only sale Saturday. Call (626) 405-2100.</TE>

<LD>Mama met Jasmyn at the door. "There's a surprise waiting for you in
the living room," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Jasmyn's eyes lit up like birthday candles when she saw her
favorite aunt sitting on the couch. She rushed over to give her a big
teddy-bear squeeze, but Baby Ashley was hogging her arms.</LD>
<LD>   Her Aunt Jen blew her a kiss instead.</LD>
<TE>   Aunt Jen was anxious to make an announcement. "You're going to be
a cousin," she said to Jasmyn.</TE>
<TE>   "Aunt Jen is going to have twins," Mama said.</TE>
<TE>   "More babies?" Jasmyn was beginning to feel outnumbered.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn crinkled her brow. For her entire life she had had Aunt Jen
to herself. Now she would have to share her with Baby Ashley and twin
cousins.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I take a bubble bath?" asked Jasmyn, anxious to wash off the
baby powder.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I'll be able to get my kids into the tub so easily," said
Aunt Jen with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Mama's and Aunt Jen's shoulders bobbed up and down as they
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn practiced her spelling words in the tub. The spelling bee
was tomorrow, and "practice makes perfect" was her teacher's motto.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, Baby Ashley's cries woke Jasmyn. She slipped
into her pink fuzzy piggy slippers and shuffled into the baby's
nursery, where Mama was pacing the floor with Baby Ashley folded in
her arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't sleep," she said, rubbing her tired eyes. "Can you take
her back to the hospital?"</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be silly," said Mama, massaging the baby's back in small
circles, quieting her kitten-like cries.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn knew the hospital didn't have a baby return policy, but she
just wanted things to be the way they were before Baby Ashley came to
live with them.</TE>
<TE>   Life would never be the same, she thought.</TE>

<LD>The three rock legends scandalized America in their heyday with
risque lyrics, flamboyant stage antics and guitar licks and drumbeats
deemed "primitive." On Tuesday night, the fire that fueled Little
Richard, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry had dimmed only slightly. "I'm
still jumpin'," Diddley told a crowd of reporters. "Ain't nothing get
old but ideas."</LD>
<LD>   Richard, 69, wore his trademark coiffure and rhinestone-covered
boots, but kept his eyes hidden with a pair of black wraparound
sunglasses. He chided a crowd of photographers as if they were small
children. "Come on baby!" he shouted as the flashbulbs went off.
"Take it baby! Take it!" Diddley, 73, stood beside him, occasionally
glancing to his right to make sure his manager, Faith Fusillo, was
capturing the scene on video camera. Diddley also carried a tape
recorder to catch things he missed in the midst of all the
excitement. Nearby, Berry, 75, talked about his next record (12 years
in the making, he said) and then paused to tease Access Hollywood's
Pat O'Brien about the anchor's malfunctioning camera.</LD>
<TE>   The men came together to be honored as icons at the BMI Pop Awards
ceremony in Beverly Hills. Flushed record industry folks in tuxedos
and a few nonchalant record producers and rock bands in denim and
leather crowded the Regent Beverly Wilshire, craning for a glimpse of
the evening's stars. Producer Dallas Austin (who has produced songs
for Madonna and Aretha Franklin) spotted Berry and wove through the
crowd to tentatively approach the rock innovator. The two men shook
hands and Austin just stared and smiled, seemingly star-struck.</TE>
<TE>   BMI, a performing rights organization that represents about
300,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers, has been
honoring its members annually for 50 years. At a table near the
stage, a publicist pointed to three baby-faced young men sitting
quietly and gawking at the man in the cowboy hat they suspected was
Diddley. (Their band, Lifehouse, won for its song "Hanging by a
Moment," which was the year's most played BMI song on college radio.)</TE>
<TE>   Later, after the filet mignon and the sorbet, George Thorogood
took the stage to do his rendition of "Who Do You Love?" and "I'm a
Man," as Diddley, who wrote the songs, looked on, smiling slightly at
the performance. Blues guitarist Jonny Lang kept his eyes closed
through his version of Berry's 1955 hit "Maybelline," perhaps in an
attempt to shield himself from Berry's reaction. Berry stared
intently at the stage, and Little Richard smiled, tapping his
rhinestone boot.</TE>
<TE>   A Window on War</TE>
<TE>   News reports of American military occupations rarely offer a
timely view of the emotional toll war takes on soldiers. Those
stories typically surface long after the fighting has ended. This
month, however, VH1 introduces a staged, unscripted series, "Military
Diaries," that gives viewers a rare look at post-Sept. 11 military
life. The show was created by producer R.J. Cutler, who has won
acclaim for his documentaries "American High" and "The War Room."</TE>
<TE>   The series, which debuts May 27, features the perspectives of 80
men and women of varying ages, ranks, assignments and backgrounds,
who were given video cameras in early January and asked to record
their thoughts 15 minutes a day for about a month on a broad range of
topics, from their love lives to their jobs. In the end, producers
were bombarded with footage. "The average diarist filmed 90 minutes a
day," said Cutler. (The Defense Department gave producers the final
word. While military officials reviewed the tapes and made
suggestions, the series wasn't subject to military censors.) The
results are striking.</TE>
<TE>   One woman named Kathryn, a Duke University grad who leads a
construction crew in Afghanistan, weeps to the camera about her
inability to help the impoverished children living on the streets
there. In another episode, a serviceman admits: "I do not love my
government, but I do love my country." Aboard the aircraft carrier
John C. Stennis, which was stationed in the Persian Gulf, a
23-year-old Petty Officer 3rd Class named Charlie tells the camera:
"I want to be able to take a 15-minute, hot, long, shower, and then I
want to be able to sleep. That's like asking for a million dollars
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Others reflect on Operation Anaconda, a March mission designed to
crush the last known substantial force of Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters in Afghanistan. Eight Americans died. "You're hearing from
people who have just returned from the belly of the beast," Cutler
said. "One guy talks of trying to rescue an injured soldier ... and
flying the helicopter faster than regulated and the man died ....
[Through this series] you get a window into something that you
wouldn't possibly be able to see otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I think that if acting ever didn't work out for me, I could be a
professional trampolinist," Reese Witherspoon (in all seriousness)
told Vanity Fair in the June issue.</TE>

<LD>Musiq, the neo-soul singer formerly known as Musiq Soulchild, entered
the nation's album chart at No. 1 on Wednesday, easily outpacing
Lauryn Hill's long-awaited follow-up to her 1998 Grammy winner "The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill."</LD>
<LD>   The Philadelphia native's "Juslisen" sold 260,000 copies in its
first week in stores, more than doubling the 122,000 sales of Hill's
"MTV Unplugged No. 2.0," a mostly acoustic set of new tunes.</LD>
<LD>   The other positions in the top 10 are held, in order, by Celine
Dion, Ashanti, Kenny Chesney, the "Spider-Man" soundtrack, Sheryl
Crow, the Big Tymers, Vol. 9 of "Now That's What I Call Music" and
the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.</LD>
<TE>   Two new albums by Tom Waits entered the charts at No. 32 and No.
33, suggesting that the singer's fans bought both "Blood Money" and
"Alice." The best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly
on "Girlfriend."</TE>

<LD>* Edward Hopper and Urban Realism (Santa Barbara Museum of Art, 1130
State St., Santa Barbara, [805] 963-4364). The show highlights early
works by Hopper against an overview of the realist tradition from the
early part of the 20th century to the apex of its popularity--the
establishment of the American Scene movement in the '30s. Featuring
about 50 paintings, the exhibit also includes the work of more than
30 artists who were working in New York and were originally
associated with the influences of Robert Henri and the Ashcan School.
Among works on view is Hopper's "Queensborough Bridge" (1913), a
detail of which is shown above. Ends Sept. 15. Other shows at the
museum: "Colin Campbell Cooper: Impressions of New York," ends July
7; "Desire and Devotion: Art From India, Tibet and Nepal in the John
and Berthe Ford Collection," ends June 2; "A Passionate
Collaboration: Margrethe Mather and Edward Weston," ends June 23.</LD>

adaptation of Nick Hornby's comic novel "About a Boy." Chris and Paul
Weitz, who are among the growing number of sibling collaborators (a
la the Coens and Farrellys), also wrote the screenplay. The story is
about a wealthy London playboy who forms an unlikely bond with a
fatherless teen (Nicholas Hoult) while hitting on single moms. Toni
Collette and Rachel Weisz also star. Novelist Hornby is the author of
another bestseller turned hit movie, "High Fidelity."</TE>

<LD>   Dance</LD>
<LD>   Nearly every dance idiom celebrates physical prowess, but in an
extraordinary work titled "Feeling for Open Spaces, None for Crowded
Areas," postmodern pioneer Rudy Perez does the opposite, making an
unsparing autobiographical study of the movement options available to
the visually impaired. At 72, he repeats that work as part of a
program titled "Back by Popular Demand," essentially an encore of the
talk-and-dance performance "The Art of Rudy Perez," presented last
season at Cal State L.A. He will, however, include one premiere:
"Sphinx," inspired by a beach painting by New York artist Graham
Nickson. Be warned. As a Times review commented after the 2001
performance, Perez's "genius for paring everything down to essential
statements exists only in his choreography. Indeed, something like
the opposite occurs when he begins to talk."</LD>
<TE>   Rudy Perez, "Back by Popular Demand," Armory Center for the Arts,
145 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. 8 p.m. Also Sunday, 5 p.m. $10

<TE>   Festival</TE>
<TE>   The 10th annual NoHo Theatre &amp; Arts Festival has something for
just about everyone, and, best of all, a lot of it is free. Several
outdoor stages will feature continuous entertainment, including music
and dance, and more than 100 performances will be going on in the
NoHo district's theaters. The festival also includes interactive arts
experiences for children, art exhibits, a vendor marketplace and
cuisine from more than 15 countries.</TE>
<TE>   NoHo Theatre &amp; Arts Festival 2002, NoHo Arts District, Lankershim

<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Bebop may be the jazz of the early-morning hours as seen from the

brunch-time. The Hyatt Newporter Jazz Festival gets rolling at 11:30
a.m. Saturday and Sunday, after a kickoff show Friday night by Peter
White. Some of the other performers are Keiko Matsui, Michael Franks,
Poncho Sanchez, Spyro Gyra, Joyce Cooling, Michael Paulo and Acoustic
Alchemy.</TE>

Amphitheater, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. Saturday and Sunday,

<TE>   Architecture</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that such current projects as Walt Disney Concert
Hall and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels are revitalizing the
landscape of downtown Los Angeles. Vacant buildings are being
transformed into lofts, movie palaces and landmark buildings are
being restored, and thousands of new homes may be in the works for a
proposed redevelopment district. L.A. Architect magazine celebrates
this revitalization Saturday with Downtown L.A.: Where Design Hits
the Road, which puts the spotlight on the area's older architecture.
Festivities include a block party on Traction Avenue with a bus tour
of historic downtown, a walking tour of lofts and showrooms, book
signings by architects, music performances, and a panel discussion at
the Southern California Institute of Architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown L.A.: Where Design Hits the Road, Traction Avenue,
downtown L.A. (Public parking at Southern California Institute of
Architecture, 350 Merrick St., downtown L.A.) 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Free.

<TE>   The definition of "blues" gets stretched wider than a volleyball
net at this weekend's Doheny Blues Festival at the state beach in
Dana Point. Yes, they'll be bringing in such bona fide blues veterans
as B. B. King, Charlie Musselwhite and Rod Piazza &amp; the Mighty Flyers
as well as more recent blues arrivals including Roy Rogers &amp; the
Delta Rhythm Kings and guitar hotshot Jonny Lang. But the lineup also
includes East L.A. pan-roots-music heroes Los Lobos, rock pioneers Bo
Diddley and Little Richard, country wise guy Junior Brown and
Texas-Louisiana ivory-tickler Marcia Ball. It may not all be blues,
but it ain't bad.</TE>

<LD>Whoever said there ain't no cure for the summertime blues didn't get
out much. Hollywood's looking heat-wave hot right about now, and
here's why: The trendy Las Palmas nightclub's hosting a mega-bash on
Memorial Day. The promoting duo the Bud Brothers will celebrate the
sixth anniversary of their Monday Social, the main artery of L.A.'s
dance music scene. The night's musical messiahs include Genaside II,
Q-Burns and Abstract Message.</LD>
<LD>   The Parlour Club on Santa Monica Boulevard just launched "Sockit,"
a global electronica night every second Tuesday of the month....
Speaking of Tuesdays, Christina Carey and Ian Grieve throw Dirty
every Tuesday at the Room in Hollywood, a back-alley bar off Cahuenga
Boulevard. The raucous rock party is Tuesday's hottest H-wood hap'.</LD>
<LD>   Promoter Brent Bolthouse, who turned me on to Ozomatli in '96,
says Postcards is the new hot band. He hasn't steered me wrong
yet.... Speaking of hot bands, Mad at Gravity performs on Monday at
the Troubadour.... Hottie Dennis Quaid is back at Moomba on
Wednesdays. If you haven't treated yourself to his band, you're
silly. It's loads of fun and waaay L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Happy news for Valley hipsters (once an oxymoron): The new supper
club Platinum Live makes a splashy debut on June 7. And speaking of
splashy debuts, Overstreet's Wine Merchant and Wine Bar opens in
Newport Beach on Friday with a performance by jazz great Jack
Sheldon.</TE>
<TE>   For those with a travel budget: The hot L.A. band Deadsy kicks off
its tour with Korn and Puddle of Mudd in Pennsylvania on June 20. ...
Joey Ramones' fans are invited to celebrate his birthday at New
York's Bowery Ballroom on Saturday. L.A.'s own Coyote Shivers is
headlining at the request of Ramone's mother, Charlotte. Bless her
heart.</TE>

<HD>An Illuminating 'Dutchman'</HD>
<DH>Bass Robert Hale and soprano Rita Cullis stand out in an
abstract production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Opera designers and stage directors like to make a splash with
Wagner's operas, and "The Flying Dutchman" is an easy target.</LD>
<LD>   It has been updated, downsized, reinvented, shorn of its
intermissions and played in one act, abstracted and
simplified--always in the name of relevance and dramatic
illumination. The opera-goer must be grateful when "Dutchman" is
still recognizable as the mythological tragedy of the doomed sailor
and the obsessive young woman who offers him redemption.</LD>
<LD>   The new production that San Diego Opera is playing, through
Wednesday, is not outrageous, but it is abstract. No scenery clutters
the stage, though there are two small constructions to anchor the
action.</LD>
<TE>   Designer Constantinos Kritikos and stage director David Edwards
use lighting--especially a moving box of colored light, varied in
size and frequency of appearance--to suggest mood or milieu, and to
frame the singing actors. Whole banks of lights hang over the stage
before the opera begins, rise as the performance begins, then return
at the end. A reminder that this is only a show?</TE>
<TE>   Costumes, on the other hand, reflect the time of the opera's
premiere in 1843. They look confining and repressive--the men's and
women's choruses seem depressingly like middle-class burghers.</TE>
<TE>   In this 19th century setting, the music drama plays effectively,
despite the distractions offered by those moving squares and
rectangles of colored light.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it also sounds convincing. The San Diego Opera
Orchestra, under the authoritative guidance of resident conductor
Karen Keltner, makes compelling Wagnerian music to underline strong
singing from the principals, who move well and convincingly in
Edward's sensible staging.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hale makes believable the Dutchman's agonizing situation
and his timeless youth, matching his compelling acting with a voice
of heartiness and resonance. Hale's bass-baritone is a young and
robust voice despite his status as a veteran Wagnerian and a Dutchman
who has been singing the role since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   His commanding Senta is British soprano Rita Cullis, who has all
the vocal beauty, size and pungency the role requires plus a
thrilling poise in the acting of it. Her appearance on the Civic
Theatre stage has to be one of the high points of this memorable San
Diego Opera season.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some wobbling sounds early on, Daniel Sumegi copes
manfully with the demands of Daland. John Keyes blustered
convincingly as Erik. Joseph Hu made healthy and attractive sounds as
the Steersman. And Ilse Apestegui proved impressive in the often
thankless role of Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Well-prepared by Timothy Todd Simmons, the two choruses sang
lustily and clearly.</TE>

<HD>Getting Down and Devilish</HD>
<DH>At Hollywood's lounge-chic Sixty-Six, Tuesday nights belong
to El Diablo</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KASTLE WASERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping inside Sixty-Six affects you a bit like a giant Spanish fly.
The club appears as if through the lenses of an aphrodisiac.
Wall-sized murals of Latina femme fatales stare out and invite you to
their devilish world. The midsection lounge is studded with crosses
reminding you to repent in the morning. And on Tuesday nights--aptly
known as El Diablo--go-go dancers clad in skimpy rock gear and
devil's horns roam the room looking to shake things up while live
rock 'n' roll pounds away.</LD>
<LD>   So who's sinning at Sixty-Six? Almost everyone lately. The
clientele includes the usual Hollywood rock scenesters making the
club rounds, an after-work crowd looking to unwind over cocktails,
and a respectable smattering of celebrities checking out the
late-night action. El Diablo, specifically, provides a place to kick
back and take in live music where the vibe is lounge-chic. Patrons
enjoy the band from intimate table seating or in the back row of
cushy couches.</LD>
<TE>   The club resides in the former location of one of Hollywood's top
jazz venues, the Baked Potato, which was put up for sale after
business slowed over the past few years. Seizing the opportunity to
create a new hot spot, partners Jay Krymis (who also owns West
Hollywood's Fubar) and Nick Moller (who runs the Redondo Beach sports
bar Nick's) moved into their new venture last summer. In November,
after four months of renovations, the club reopened as Sixty-Six. The
venue features an eclectic mix of entertainment, but Krymis reserves
Tuesday night for rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of my baby. That's the crowd I like to hang out in,"
he says. DJ Amy Bunny came on board in January and Krymis later
recruited John Arakaki and Keri Bruce, both club scenesters and local
musicians, to book the live bands. "He knew that I knew people and he
wanted to create a friendly environment to let loose, have fun music
and bring in a rock 'n' roll element," says Arakaki.</TE>
<TE>   Their local band bookings have included Sugar Puss, the Pleasure
Seekers, Chezz Monroe and Bang Sugar Bang. The bookers have also
showcased some previously little-known talent: April's house band,
the Golden Bats, has inspired a following.</TE>
<TE>   Both Amy Bunny and Arakaki have their own bands that occasionally
make their way onto the club's stage. Being musicians has helped the
promoters know more about the accommodations that bands and their
audiences are looking for. "The club in general is artist-friendly,"
says Arakaki. "And because I do play in a band I know what kind of
setup people want and I can answer their questions directly without
having to go through anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Other nights at Sixty-Six include Monday night's hip-hop reggae
club Cherri and Thursday's upscale, velvet-rope R&amp;B dance club, Blow.
Friday nights feature a happy hour from 5 to 7 with half-price
drinks, free buffet and the earthy party band Storytyme. Mainstream
R&amp;B dancing draws the weekend crowd on Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   The last Sunday of the month hosts a new club, Cafe Flesh,
featuring '60s and '70s Euro go-go dance music and campy
sexploitation films done with Warhol-style flair, hosted by Beauty
Bar's DJ George. On the first Sunday of the month, New York's
notorious drag diva Jackie Beat moves in to host "That Time of the
Month," a drag revue show and dance club.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-Six also serves a menu of Mexican-American cuisine, which is
still under refinement. But ultimately it may be the timing of
Sixty-Six's opening that will prove to be its ticket to success. With
bars like the Well and Daddy's in close proximity, Sixty-Six is
becoming the new stop on an increasingly popular circuit. According
to Krymis, "We know that this is not going to be a neighborhood bar.
It's a destination location, so we've got to book things that are
going to draw people in."</TE>
<TE>   The devil wouldn't want it any other way.</TE>

<HD>Burmese Food: A Rare Treat</HD>
<DH>Yoma in Monterey Park is one of the few local places to
serve the fascinating cuisine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first thing you notice about Yoma is the sign in the window
reading "Thai Food." That's there to attract people who know a lot
about pad Thai and mee krob but probably nothing about Yoma's real
specialty, the food of Burma (now called Myanmar).</LD>
<LD>   It's filling a real gap. Until Yoma opened in Monterey Park a few
months ago, there were only three ways to get Burmese food around
here: Make Burmese friends, attend Buddhist temple events involving
home-cooked food, or go to the Golden Triangle in Whittier.</LD>
<LD>   Yoma, which took over a site formerly occupied by a Thai
restaurant, has separate menus and separate cooks for each cuisine.
The Thai dishes may serve as a safety net, but they're good in their
own right.</LD>
<TE>   The Burmese food, though, is fascinating. Myanmar ginger salad
combines fine shreds of ginger root with dried garlic, beans,
shallots, sesame seeds, peanuts and onion, providing a wealth of
tastes and contrasting textures.</TE>
<TE>   Opo is a mild green squash with white flesh. Cut into sticks,
dipped in sturdy batter and deep fried until brown and crisp, it
comes to the table sizzling hot, crunchy yet soft. There's a spicy
sweet-and-sour sauce for dipping, but the subtle flavor of the squash
is so pleasant it doesn't need any help. Fried onion slices, served
with the same sauce, ought to please onion ring lovers.</TE>
<TE>   Burmese salads are intriguing, not like anything you'd find in
other Asian restaurants. Samusa salad, for example, is just what it
sounds like: Indian-style potato-stuffed samosas torn into pieces and
tossed with seasonings reminiscent of Indian curry. Eat it while the
pastry wrappers are still crisp.</TE>
<TE>   The prosaic name "vegetable noodle salad" doesn't hint at the
exciting blend of flavors: noodles, cucumber, cabbage and bean
fritters. The effect is sweet and sour, salty and crunchy.</TE>
<TE>   Mohinga salad, which mixes rice noodles with sliced fish cake,
crisp-fried shallots and, again, sweet-and-sour seasonings, would
please anyone who likes pad Thai.</TE>
<TE>   But for the more adventurous, the taste of the salad of fermented
tea leaves will prove, well, different; murky, you might call it.
Fish paste (ngapi, sometimes spelled gnapi) is quite pungent and
spicy: I remember how a friend in Yangon (Rangoon) would dilute it
with lots of lime juice, which makes it palatable. Ngapi is eaten
with raw vegetables--at Yoma, lettuce and cucumber.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant has both Burmese and Thai green-papaya salads. Each
is described the same way ("papaya with spicy lemon dressing"), but
they're distant relatives at best. The Burmese version is mellow,
without the sharp, spicy, sweet-and-sour tang of Thai som tam. Yoma's
som tam is less sweet than the usual Thai rendition, but that is not
a fault. Dried shrimp add a briny note.</TE>
<TE>   Yoma makes a goat curry with a thick, dark brown sauce that shows
Indian influence, but it's unlike what you'd find in India. The fish
cake curry is strong and rather sour. The easiest to enjoy is the
mild chicken and potato curry. All curries come with rice and a
clear, light tamarind leaf soup.</TE>
<TE>   It seems absurd to pass up the Burmese dishes for Thai food, which
you can get anywhere. But if you absolutely must have pad Thai,
you'll find it satisfactory, with a deep, mellowly sweet flavor. The
panang beef curry is as pleasing as candy in its sweet, luscious
coconut sauce. Shrimp kaprow includes more onions than usual and not
as much basil, but it's worth ordering anyway. Instead of less
expensive thigh meat cubed and threaded on a stick, each chicken sate
here is a slice of chicken breast, yellow from curry spices. The
skewers come with the customary peanut sauce, fluffy and sweet with
coconut milk, and a diced cucumber relish.</TE>
<TE>   Drinks include Thai iced tea and coffee and Burmese tea, a hot,
sweetened milky drink like Indian chai but without spices.</TE>
<TE>   As a sort of Burmese cultural center, Yoma sells Burmese music
CDs, plays Burmese karaoke on the TV and sells Burmese condiments.
It's a small restaurant with a big mission: to popularize a cuisine
almost unknown around here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yoma, 713 E. Garvey Ave., Monterey Park. (626) 280-8655. Open 10

<DH>How is it that Los Angeles has become such a good place to
be a dog of leisure?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a long time I believed that there was something basically
freakish about dog people. My personal list of People to Avoid
included those who mispronounce the word " nuclear," fans of Celine
Dion and anyone who thought I'd be the slightest bit interested
hearing about his prize terrier's macrobiotic diet.</LD>
<LD>   The first two stand, but let's just say I'd probably trade recipes
with the third guy. I was forced to rethink my prejudice three years
ago, when I found myself suddenly obsessed with the training,
grooming, socialization and all-around well-being of a somewhat
spastic floppy-eared puppy named Rufus.</LD>
<LD>   Rufus arrived in my life shortly after my wife and I began to talk
about having kids. "Get a dog first," a friend advised. "Make sure
you don't kill it."</LD>
<TE>   A week later my wife brought home a stray pup of mysterious breed
(shepherd? malamute? coyote?) with an ear infection and a mangy coat
teeming with fleas. After cleaning her up and doing a quick check of
her nether region, we settled on the name Rufus. (Only later, long
after the name was established, did we discover we'd confused its
female bits for male ones.)</TE>
<TE>   Rufus quickly introduced us to such riveting subjects as crate
training, carsickness and coprophagia (don't ask). But the most
surprising discovery was that something strange and quite sudden
happened to the entire city when we weren't paying attention: Los
Angeles had turned into a dog town.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere you go, dogs and people are doing things that a few
years ago would have seemed bizarre and sometimes downright rude.
Dogs are scrounging for scraps at outdoor cafes, trotting happily
into doggie day spas and massage parlors, snoozing underfoot at
dog-friendly offices and romping ecstatically at one of the several
new leashless dog parks. Some are even curling up at patio bars: "A
gin and tonic for me and a bowl of water for the blond at the end of
the bar."</TE>
<TE>   If many of us grew up regarding dogs as furry pieces of property,
we're now treating them like temperamental toddlers. As companions,
play pals and fetishistic status symbols, dogs occupy a bigger role
in our lives than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   My own story started innocently enough, with daily trips to the
dog park and the purchase of chew toys, doggie vitamins and
"human-grade" dog food. Next thing I knew I was spending half the day
chasing a blur of slobbering fur around the house while wearing a
fanny pack stuffed with beef liver and memorizing entire passages
from a puppy training manual written by a religious order called the
Monks of New Skete.</TE>
<TE>   At night, while Rufus rested her head between her paws on her
plush sheepskin bed, I would pore over her photo album, marveling at
her development from mangy wild animal to coddled family member. I
was especially fond of a photo of a freshly groomed and grinning
Rufus wearing a T-shirt printed with the motto "Bone to be Wild." I
am not proud.</TE>
<TE>   I realized I'd crossed over into a strange new world the weekend
my wife and I checked Rufus into a "canine country club" in Sun
Valley called Paradise Ranch. Complete with four-post beds,
playgrounds and a wading pool, it turned out to be a notch or two
nicer than the B&amp;B where we were headed.</TE>
<TE>   It might have seemed like a faddish novelty at the time, but
Paradise Ranch was just the logical extension of a trend well
underway. The city's first doggie day care, a deluxe West L.A.
kennel-cum-spa where dogs enjoy pampering and playtime while their
owners toil at the office, opened in 1996. Today there are doggie day
cares all over L.A., each with a cutesier name than the last--the
Loved Dog, the Grateful Dog, Camp Happy Dog, Chow Bella, Hollywood
Hounds, Chateau Marmutt and Bow Wow Bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we've seen the arrival of dog boutiques and dog
bakeries, dog masseuses and dog acupuncturists, dog portrait artists
and dog perfumes. At Neiman Marcus, salespeople look the other way as
poodle-clutching grandmas pass women being tugged by loping Great
Danes. The family of Beverly Hills dad Ozzy Osbourne, a guy so
unconcerned with animal welfare he famously bit off the heads of a
dove and a bat, recently employed a dog therapist to help soothe the
family litter.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a political crusade, with dog owners banding together
to fight for canine civil liberties. "It's a revolution," says Daryl
Barnett, president of Freeplay, a Venice-based group that is seeking
to establish L.A.'s first off-leash dog beach. "It's like civil
rights or women getting the right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Though the city is still beset by an epidemic of stray dogs and a
shocking frequency of euthanasia (40,660 dogs will be put down this
year, according to the L.A. Department of Animal Regulation), dogs in
the upper ranks of the socioeconomic food chain are basking in
newfound luxury.</TE>
<TE>   We Angelenos like to think of ourselves as trendsetters, but it
looks as if we're behind the pack here. A doggie day care called
Yuppie Puppy was catering to guilt-ridden New Yorkers nine years
before L.A. got its such facility. And those in the dog business
point to several cities as possessing better dog amenities (Portland,
Ore., is famously dog-friendly, as are Alexandria, Va; Key West,
Fla.; and Aspen, Colo.).</TE>
<TE>   And although there are more dogs in California than in any other
state (6.8 million, according to the American Veterinary Medical
Assn.), the concentration of dogs is actually quite low in Los
Angeles (19% of L.A. homes include dogs, according to the Humane
America Animal Foundation, compared to the national average of 39%).</TE>
<TE>   We may be a small party, but no one is whooping it up more.
Portland may have its perks, but it sure doesn't have anything like
Fifi &amp; Romeo, the Beverly Boulevard boutique that sells beaded
cashmere sweaters for dogs (cost: $225) in a store surrounded by
Pucci mannequins, tasseled draperies and pink-striped walls.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs wander around like the savviest of shoppers, some hopping in
and out of sleek vinyl "doggie bags" or curiously nuzzling a display
of wool dog sweaters. Co-owner Penelope Francis says she began
creating swank dog fashions three years ago, when she went searching
for something to keep her pet Chihuahua, Peanut, warm.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept saying to myself, 'I wouldn't wear that,'" she says. "Why
would I put that on my dog?"</TE>
<TE>   That's it in a nutshell--for many of us, dogs have become natural
extensions of ourselves. Paul Owens, who runs a Burbank training
school called Raise With Praise and is one of a few self-proclaimed
"dog whisperers," says Angelenos are "awakening to a new
consciousness about dogs."</TE>
<TE>   So, the thinking goes, if I wrap myself in embroidered cashmere,
enjoy a weekly massage or make it a point to avoid partially
hydrogenated oils, why shouldn't my dog?</TE>
<TE>   Setting aside for a moment the question of whether this is flaky
anthropomorphism or an evolved expression of kindness--I know what
side Peanut would be on--I wonder, simply, why?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there's a long Hollywood tradition of treating pets like
royalty. Everyone from Audrey Hepburn to Halle Berry has traipsed
around town cradling well-coifed toy breeds with tummies quivering
beneath snug sweater vests. But when did so many of the rest of us
start acting like pampered starlets? What happened in a few short
years to suddenly elevate the status of an entire species?</TE>
<TE>   The shift has been fueled by three of the most powerful forces in
Los Angeles: love, vanity and envy.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, for very practical reasons, we Angelenos are
uniquely positioned to love our dogs like no one else. In a city
filled with actors and writers, independent contractors, privileged
layabouts, struggling freelancers and others working sporadic or
stay-at-home jobs, our attention is naturally drawn to others with
flexible schedules. A trip up to the off-leash park at Runyon Canyon
in Hollywood on a weekday afternoon reveals dozens of these full-time
love affairs in full bloom. At an hour of the day when less fortunate
dogs are snoozing in their backyards, the mountain park swarms with
dogs of all sizes and descriptions: dogs in jaunty kerchiefs and dogs
in yelping packs. Trailing behind, their human companions whistle and
shout words of praise or correction, as impassioned as parents at a
soccer match.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason we Angelenos have become so infatuated with
dogs is that they're just so darned sincere. In social circles often
held together by loose or superficial bonds, dogs offer
uncomplicated, unconditional relationships. In short, doggies don't
air-kiss.</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly helps explain typical L.A. love affairs like the
one between Claude Dauman, who owns the Internet swimwear company
www.bestswimwear.com and a half-Pekingese, half-poodle named Mallie
Munchkin.</TE>
<TE>   Working at home, Dauman devotes much of his time and attention to
Mallie. He feeds her a strict diet of cartilage-enriched kibble and
cooked chicken chunks, hosts a fan Web page devoted to his "life
partner" (www.malliemunchkin .com) and eases her trip to their bed
with a custom staircase complete with carpeted steps. "She's the
alpha in this family," he says. "I don't want to sound like a
psychopath, but sometimes I get the feeling she thinks of me as her
extremely large offspring."</TE>
<TE>   And as his Web site makes abundantly clear, Dauman isn't shy about
letting the world share his love. That's also one of the other
particular attractions of dog ownership in a city that places such a
high premium on good looks and sociability. Even when you're feeling
dumpy, antisocial or downright surly, a happy dog can't help but be
charming. I'm sure the owners of the supermodel Weimaraners and
spunky springer spaniels I see parading around the dog park feel
genuine affection for their animals, but don't you sometimes suspect
that the real appeal for the owners is all the attention they
attract?</TE>
<TE>   You could say this is superficial or sad, but I'm not so sure. We
Angelenos too often stay stuck in the same small orbit; if our dogs
allow us to explore new parts of the city or attract the attention of
people we wouldn't ordinarily encounter, I say hooray.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere I go with my dog, people immediately let down their
guard and come rushing up to me," says Los Feliz photographerLara Jo
Regan. "It doesn't matter if it's in an Armenian neighborhood or
Beverly Hills, people just come out of their shells."</TE>
<TE>   It helps to know that Regan has perhaps the cutest dog on the face
of the planet: Mr. Winkle, a Pomeranian mix with a permanently
lolling pink tongue. In a modern twist to the old Hollywood fairy
tale, Regan plucked Mr. Winkle off a roadside in Bakersfield and made
him a star, attracting a cult following on a Web site (www.mrwinkle
.com) and parlaying his fame into the sale of calendars and T-shirts
and a book deal with Random House.</TE>
<TE>   Regan says she's often approached by people in L.A.'s suddenly
booming dog business, offering free designer get-ups, day spa passes
and therapy sessions. To Regan, such services reflect "enlightened
new thinking" about dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's reasonable and not at all kooky," she says. "People
are becoming aware that animals are sentient beings with real souls.
It's horribly egocentric to think we're the only ones who enjoy
ourselves or get depressed or have special health needs."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, though, not everyone investing in the extra TLC is so
enlightened. Dogs may be sentient beings, but they're also status
symbols that simultaneously set their owners apart from some and
signal allegiance to others.</TE>
<TE>   The Hydrant Cafe in Venice is a perfect place to watch people and
dogs sniff one another out. At the deli counter, which naturally is
filled with baked goods made for canine palates, a Chihuahua is on
its hind legs, yapping hysterically at a Pomeranian. Without a word,
you can tell that the frantic pair standing nearby think of
themselves as sophisticated, sassy and perhaps a little indulgent.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, outside, others sit quietly sipping lattes, their
Labradors and shepherds lapping up bowls of "frosty paws" ice cream.
As much as their clothing or cars, these customers have silently
transmitted their own MO: domestic, down-to-earth and maybe a little
conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's a whole separate distinction attached to mutts. The
mangier and more mixed up the breeding, the more honorable the owner.
"It's a badge of honor to have a rescue dog," says Karen Rosa,
communications manager for the American Humane Assn. "It's
multicultural, and what could be more L.A. than that?"</TE>
<TE>   With so many of us babying our cars and obsessing over our
clothes, is it any wonder we've become so sensitive to the cachet of
the canine? Status is a major factor drawing pet owners to the
year-old Bow Wow Bungalow, a toy-filled doggie day care in North
Hollywood that could pass for an exclusive preschool for unusually
mouthy children. Co-owner Brie Campbell says she suspects many of her
customers drop their dogs off in part for the image it projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason they're doing this is so they can tell their
friends about it," she says. "In L.A., dogs are an accessory. People
want to be seen as cool and caring."</TE>
<TE>   Ouch. All this thinking about the status and pampering of dogs is
suddenly making me very uncomfortable. What does it say about me and
my wife that we chose a sexually ambiguous, possibly feral mutt as
our social status symbol? And what was the real reason we took Rufus
to Paradise Ranch: to give her a taste of luxury, or to give us
bragging rights?</TE>
<TE>   In any case, it's hardly worth fretting over such questions
anymore. The fact is that our infatuation with Rufus didn't last so
very long. It came to an abrupt end the moment another small messy
creature arrived in our home. The birth of our son Charlie ended
Rufus' reign. And the arrival of another competitor for our fickle
affections--this one a girl-child called Eliza--further diminished
the dog's hold on us.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not saying we love Rufus any less now, but she definitely gets
less tangible proof of that love. Trips to the dog park have become
less frequent. The $45 bags of Eukanuba Lamb and Rice Formula have
been replaced by bulk sacks of kibble from Costco. The only new chew
toys she gets are those she snatches from the nursery. Dog vitamins,
once a staple, are now given on a whim. About the only advantage for
Rufus is all the mashed-up peas and carrots suddenly raining down
from on high.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many other Angelenos, our dog was a tryout for actual
children (they are just as commonly an aging baby boomer's
replacement for a bird that's left the nest). Fifi &amp; Romeo's Penelope
Francis says she laughs when she hears one of her customers is
pregnant. "I know I've just lost a customer," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She cites Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna, both public dog fanciers
whose pups became invisible once they had kids. "What ever happened
to Madonna's dogs anyway?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Rufus staged just one small protest. Two weeks after
Charlie was born, I woke up in the middle of the night to find her
skulking around the nursery, wide-eyed and whining. There, carefully
arranged in a crude swirl on the new baby-blue carpet, were five
steaming demonstrations of her feelings about her sudden descent from
heavenly creature to lower life form.</TE>
<TE>   I know I should have disciplined her, but it just wasn't in me.
All I could think was, fair enough, Rufus, fair enough.</TE>

<LD>Students from the David and Barbara Abell Music Magnet School and the
Stephen and Carrie Odell Theatre Arts Academy at Washington
Preparatory High School will present a production of an urban
musical, "Ephraim's Song," from May 30 to June 2 at Washington Prep.</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by actor-playwright-teacher Mark Swinton, and
featuring the music of the hip-hop/R&amp;B recording artists known as
City High, the musical is about the frustration and bewilderment that
surround a group of young people who have given up on direction and
are trying to live life their own way. The score was written and
produced by City High's Robby Pardlo and Ryan Toby.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   General admission is $10 for adults; $5 for students; tickets for
May 30 gala opening are $25. (323) 757-9281, Ext. 1113.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intense stick-figure drawings and the uncoordinated scrawl of a young
boy peek out from behind the brown-paper cover of "Two Brothers of
Monster Town." The grade-school children in the audience sit
cross-legged on the Persian carpet, so attentive you'd think their
first book was being shared. The grown-up who stands before them
admits that the self-published book is his, written when he was about
their age.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Hale, author of the "Chet Gecko" series of junior novels, is
sharing this information, author to would-be authors, at a monthly
Saturday gathering that begins at the post-soccer hour of 4 p.m. at
Storyopolis, a Los Angeles children's bookstore and art gallery.</LD>
<LD>   "After being in business for six years, we were starting to lose
our customer base of [formerly] 2- and 3-year-olds," says Dawn
Heinrichs, co-founder of Storyopolis. "They loved the store, but we
didn't offer anything to entertain or interest them. We wanted to
encourage art appreciation and the love of reading, so 'super-sized'
events were born."</LD>
<TE>   They are "super-sized" because they are aimed at people 6 and
older and because the workshops try to accomplish more than the
bookstore's usual story-and-craft hour. They try to teach the craft
of storytelling and the art of creative thinking, Heinrichs says.</TE>
<TE>   A Switch From Writing to Animation</TE>
<TE>   When the workshops began in January, they centered on writing. A
playwright has helped children develop a mini-play while mystery
writer Hale led a brainstorming session for an animal-hero story the
children named "Zoey the Dog." ("Every hero has to have a sickness,"
Hale said, so the dog, which goes on an adventure in Paris, had a bad
sense of smell.)</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the focus switches to animation, with DreamWorks'
"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" as a jumping-off point. Veteran
animator Cathy Jones is expected to draw Spirit and Rain, who star in
the film, and talk about the complexities of drawing horses, which
are probably the hardest animals to animate, says Fumi Kitahara, a
DreamWorks spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "The animators have talked about how horses have a rigid backbone
and people are used to seeing horses, so drawing them is a lot less
forgiving," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Author Cathleen Duey will read from and sign her novelization of
the film, and a two-minute trailer from "Spirit" will be shown. Frank
Gladstone, who heads the artistic development group at DreamWorks,
will teach the kids how to create animation flip books.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll use 'Spirit' storyboards and talk in the simplest terms to
these kids to explain the process of animation," Kitahara says.</TE>
<TE>   To complete their junior-Hollywood experience, attendees will be
given screening passes to see the movie before it opens May 24.</TE>
<TE>   This summer's Storyopolis events are keyed to "out-of-the-box or
creative thinking for typical things," Heinrichs says. Although the
lineup often depends on who's available, the aim is to give kids an
enriching experience they might not get in school.</TE>
<TE>   An architectural workshop on June 22 will focus on creative uses
of space; "Breaking the Spine" on July 20 will feature bookmaking;
and a school projects workshop on Aug. 24 will explain how to use
creative thinking to make the most of school projects.</TE>
<TE>   The architecture workshop is partly a reprise of the debut
"super-sized" event, which featured architect Alla Kazovsky, Susan
Purcell, her design partner, and their buildin'box, their
architectural kit for children.</TE>
<TE>   After covering the basic elements of architecture, the pair plans
to talk about basic building structures, then set loose teams of four
to six children to construct with cardboard. Last time around, the
kids made skyscrapers, swimming pools, spaceships and boats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a learning experience to think about how you are going to
make the curve or have windows fit within the framework. If you want
to use a toilet-paper roll as a tower, how does it fit?" Purcell
says. "It's definitely different than arts and crafts class."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Animation workshop Saturday at 4 p.m. at Storyopolis. $6. 116 N.
Robertson, Los Angeles. (310) 358-2500; www.storyopolis.com. Future
workshops are $6 to $10 per child.</TE>

<LD>* The chef at the downtown seafood restaurant Water Grill also worked
at the original Spago.</LD>
<LD>   Old Spoons and Wacky Spatulas: Many times, my family and I have
gone to the Rose Bowl flea market in Pasadena, which is the second
Sunday of every month. We've gotten all sorts of things there. I've
picked up some old albums and we'll find things for our kitchen.
Being a chef, I collect funky little utensils like automatic spatulas
that flip things over by pressing them or old spoons or knives. It's
also a great place for people watching.</LD>
<LD>   Logging Town With Hippies: We opened a new restaurant last year in
San Diego, and I was away from the family for a couple of months,
except for maybe one day a week. So, what we decided to do when I had
some free time was rent a house in Guerneville, which is a logging
community that's a little bit north of the wine country. It's really
rustic with a lot of hippies. The house was beautiful and located
right next to the Russian River with a big deck. So, we just
completely withdrew for 10 days. We made day trips to Sonoma and
Napa.</LD>
<TE>   Dining for Scenesters: In San Francisco, the restaurant scene is
much more of an organic experience in that it's not so much about the
style or the scene-like attributes of a restaurant. It's more about
people finding places where they feel comfortable, which they choose
to frequent. Whereas in Los Angeles, or in many cases, in New York,
you need to be hot, you need to be a scene before you really become
successful. If I think about the restaurants in San Francisco that
have been there for years like Chez Panisse or Zuni, it's definitely
not a scene. They're just heartfelt, sincere restaurants. They're
built more out of a real affinity for dining.</TE>
<TE>   Fancy Foods: I love Surfas. It's a restaurant supply store, but
it's open to the public. It's between Venice and Washington on
National in Culver City. They have a lot of large equipment that
wouldn't be interesting to an avid home cook. But they also have this
gourmet section in there with dry goods and groceries that's just
amazing. There are things there that you can't find anywhere else,
just amazing quality olive oils, vinegars and sea salts, beautiful
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Sicilian Cuisine: I like to go to a place called La Fornaretta in
Pasadena. It's a Sicilian restaurant with good, simple Italian food,
sort of like a mom-and-pop place with the wife running the kitchen
and the husband looking after the front of the house, which is a lot
like what it would be like in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   No Pesticides: The Sunday-morning farmer's market in Hollywood is
awesome. It's my favorite. We go to the one on Wednesdays for the
restaurant in Santa Monica and then there's also the one on Saturday
in Santa Monica. But the one in Hollywood, I just love. It's fun to
spend a couple of hours there looking around. That usually leads to a
nice Sunday-night dinner cooked at home.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Kick Out of 'Pussycat Dolls Live'</HD>
<DH>The lush and leggy retro revue, performed on Thursdays at
the Roxy, brings back chorus girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pussycat Dolls have been something of an underground L.A.
phenomenon ever since they debuted at Johnny Depp's Viper Room in the
mid-'90s. Scantily clad and wholesomely steamy, the Dolls--the
closest thing to an old-fashioned line of chorus girls since Ciro's
closed down--seem to have touched some atavistic impulse in the
hipster club crowd that frequents their shows.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the lush and leggy Dolls, spearheaded by Carmen Electra, a
surprisingly nifty little hoofer, can be experienced in all their
voluptuous glory in "Pussycat Dolls Live at the Roxy," a retro revue
on Thursdays only at the Roxy on--where else?--the Sunset Strip. The
show, such as it is (the whole enterprise lasts less than an hour),
offers plenty of vamping and camping and spirited thrusting by women
with the most gravity-defying bodies this side of a Vargas painting.</LD>
<TE>   Director Kristin Hanggi, whose recent stagings of "bare" and
"Corpus Christi" gained wide attention, and choreographer-creator
Robin Antin, the founder and driving force behind the Dolls, have
gift-wrapped a slick and streamlined package with appropriately
glitzy and well-rendered design elements. Particularly striking are
the tight and glittering costumes by Antin, Kathleen Fischer and
Deborah Lindquist. Skimpy affairs featuring plenty of leather and
wisps of lace, the outfits stay magically in place--if just
barely--throughout the aerobic dance maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   Musical numbers alternate from the down and dirty ("Bump &amp; Grind,"
"The Stripper") to the playful ("All I Do Is Dream of You") and
feature the same sultry dancing you might see on any MTV video. The
problem with any chorus line is that it is typically only trotted out
between the headline acts. In "Dolls," there is no headline
entertainer, a void that even the lithe Electra or the formidably
poised Christina Applegate, one of the show's alternating celebrity
hosts, cannot fill.</TE>
<TE>   But of course, the point of this evening is cheesecake, cheesecake
and more cheesecake, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. If you
have philosophical objections to beautiful women bumping and grinding
to beat the band, this isn't your ticket. If not, you might find
"Dolls" worth a peek.</TE>

<HD>Camilo Trio Gets an A in Chemistry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Michel Camilo has been on the jazz scene since the early
'80s, when his song "Why Not?" became a hit for Manhattan Transfer.
Since then he has worked as a regular with Paquito D'Rivera and led a
succession of his own small ensembles.</LD>
<LD>   But Camilo has never had a better band than the trio he brought to
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Tuesday night. Bassist Anthony Jackson and
Cuban drummer Horacio "El Negro" Hernandez--both of whom are present
on Camilo's new Telarc album "Triangulo"--interacted with Camilo with
stunning fluency. True, they were working with preset arrangements on
most of the numbers, but beyond the written music, there was a
constant level of interplay, a sense of three players responding to
one another's every action, performing as a single, multifaceted
musical entity.</LD>
<LD>   It began with Camilo, whose playing blended Cuban tumbaos with
McCoy Tyner-like arpeggios, brisk Ahmad Jamal-inspired chording and
his own wildly energetic, two-handed multi-rhythms. His Dominican
roots surfaced frequently in foot-tapping passages of
merengue-pambiche rhythms--especially during a romp through "From
Within," a tune featured in the film "Calle 54."</LD>
<TE>   The bespectacled Jackson, round and smiling, enthusiastically
mouthed his music lines as he played them, looking frequently toward
Camilo to make eye contact, accenting important transition points
with a flourish of his right hand. Hernandez, dark hair reaching to
his shoulders, was equally spirited, equally connected with the
others; although he played a standard jazz drum kit, he used it like
a percussionist, alternating small sounds with large bombasts, adding
compositional structure to the music with sudden shifts of sound and
texture.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the music could be traced to the new album. There was a
lovely rendering of Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona's "La Comparsa"
and an electrifying tribute to Tito Puente titled "Descarga for
Tito." But high voltage aside, one of the most impressive numbers of
the evening was the touching, understated ballad "Afterthought." The
contrast between the intimate quiet of this tune and the vigorous
Caribbean rhythms that filled the balance of the set precisely
defined the remarkable range of creativity in the fine trio's
sparkling musical chemistry.</TE>

<HD>'Sunshine Boys' a Laugh Expedition</HD>
<DH>Falcon Theatre's production of Simon's play hits the funny
bone but not the heartstrings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neil Simon's valentine to vaudeville "The Sunshine Boys" is
helium-light, so it takes strong actors to provide emotional
resonance and comic heft. The two canny stage veterans starring in
the Falcon Theatre's production enjoyably accomplish the latter; the
former is more elusive.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Gorshin--impressionist extraordinaire and the Riddler in the
original "Batman" TV series--and Dick Van Patten, who virtually grew
up on Broadway but is best known as the "Eight Is Enough" dad, are
the long-estranged members of the once-famous Lewis and Clark comedy
team.</LD>
<LD>   In the play, directed by Curt Wollan, Gorshin has the central
role. He's irascible Willie Clark, subsisting in a shabby hotel,
watching soaps and waiting for his long-suffering nephew and agent,
Ben (James Van Patten), to bring groceries, Variety and forbidden
cigars. Willie's also nursing a grudge: After Lewis and Clark's
triumphant "Ed Sullivan Show" appearance 11 years before, Al retired,
leaving Willie to struggle solo.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Ben brings news that CBS wants Lewis and Clark to reunite for
an American humor retrospective. Will the lure of the spotlight
soften Willie's bitterness?</TE>
<TE>   Gorshin, shuffling about in pajamas and slippers, with a petulant
face as crumpled as an old leather wallet, is a gleefully calculating
curmudgeon, despite one quick impression of Ed Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   As Ben, the younger Van Patten has some hilarious hyperventilating
moments coping with Willie, who deliberately, childishly,
misunderstands and misleads everyone in his limited sphere. Dick Van
Patten is quieter as the seemingly complacent Al, and if some of that
quiet reads more like a touch of real fatigue (he and Gorshin did the
recent national tour of the show) he gives as good as he gets as the
reunion goes south.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the pleasure in watching these two pros: the wickedly
funny back-and-forth snap they bring to Al and Willie's escalating
insults, one-liners, patter and irrepressible one-upmanship.</TE>
<TE>   The shadows the "Sunshine Boys" face--the vulnerability of aging
performers whose time is not only long gone, but who are also
becoming increasingly dependent--are shaped with less conviction. The
funny bone is tickled, but the heart isn't engaged.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting cast does a respectable job, although Leslie
Thurston seems tentative as the I've-seen-it-all home nurse; Shane
Partlow is the stooge and Lola Lesheim has the required va-va-voom as
the nurse in the vaudeville sketch that almost makes it to TV; and
Jon Andrew Hegge plays the frustrated assistant TV director.</TE>

<HD>Reaching Back, Sylvian Struggles With Balance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can music be both understated and grandiose? When David Sylvian
achieved that delicate balance at the Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday, the
results were mesmerizing. But when he didn't it was perplexing,
because he's clearly capable of transcendent work.</LD>
<LD>   That's been about par for the career of Sylvian, an arty British
crooner in the tradition of David Bowie and Bryan Ferry. And perhaps
it was appropriate, as this show was a retrospective of that career,
reaching back nearly 25 years to his days fronting the band Japan
through his catalog of solo work and collaborations with such
singular figures as Robert Fripp and Ryuichi Sakamoto.</LD>
<LD>   The aesthetic tug of war was acted out on stage. The dapper
Sylvian (think Bono styled by Robert Palmer) was at the center, and
drummer Steve Jansen (a Japan veteran) and bassist Keith Lowe were on
the right, shaping the music with economical yet complex grace and
power. To the left, though, guitarist Timothy Young and keyboardist
Matt Cooper often tipped the scale toward the overwrought with
excessive showiness in both playing and manner.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper, in particular, while possessing accomplished jazz-informed
chops, regularly detracted from the emotions and musical colors of
the songs both with inappropriate noodling and gratuitous body
English and grimaces.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on "Heartbeat (Taini Kaiki II)," a Sakamoto collaboration,
recorded sounds blended with Sylvian's languid vocals to bridge art
and soul. On "Cover Me With Flowers" there was a marriage of poetic
(if over-arching) lyrics with rhythms and dynamics recalling Peter
Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   The audience cheered every song and solo as if they contained
epiphanies. But it was easy to picture even the staunchest loyalists
being swayed had Sylvian stripped the performance down to just the
understated beauty it contained.</TE>

<HD>From School Days to Wild Nights</HD>
<DH>The movie 'someBody,' opening Friday, mixes fact and
fiction about the after-hours appetites of teacher Stephanie Bennett</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "someBody," Stephanie Bennett plays a schoolteacher who worries
what the parents of her young charges would think if they knew how
wild she was after hours. "You're supposed to be teaching morals and
manners," she says to an unseen, unheard interviewer in the faux
documentary, which opens Friday at Laemmle's Sunset 5.</LD>
<LD>   In real life, Bennett was a teacher whose extracurricular
activities in bars and bedrooms around Los Angeles made her friends'
jaws drop. But she's not losing too much sleep over what the parents
of her former students--or her own parents, for that matter--might
think when they see her burn a swathe through L.A. nightlife in the
gritty "someBody."</LD>
<LD>   "It would make me uncomfortable if they saw the movie," she says
of both groups of parents. "But even though I've made no secret that
this is about things I went through, this is not in fact a
documentary, and I'm an artist. Ultimately, I didn't make it for
those kids' parents or my family."</LD>
<TE>   The film, a Sundance entry last year, grew out of a messy breakup
Bennett endured after leaving her college boyfriend of seven years to
try on the stiff new shoes of a single person. Finding herself
unmoored for the first time in her life, she embarked on a spree of
overconsumption--of drink, men and regret.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching it in the editing room, it's so clear that it's
self-destructive and self-involved, but those were the real things I
was going through," says Bennett, 31. "I was very, very scared of,
what if I got sick? Am I going to grow old alone? So I started going
to clubs and in my search for another somebody, it became, 'I don't
want to be alone.' It wasn't, 'How am I going to figure out how to
live alone?' It was, 'I've got to find somebody else right now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's words, slightly tinged with a Texas drawl, tumble out in
a torrent. Dressed in a simple black dress and cardigan, she's petite
and noticeably smooth-skinned; reality does her more favors than the
grainy gaze of a digital camera. (She says the stress of reliving her
dysfunctional past also made her skin break out during the main
two-week shoot.)</TE>
<TE>   It's before hours at North, an unmarked bar in West Hollywood
where much of the overheated action--on screen and off--took place.
Beside her in the booth is Henry Barrial, 35, her diffident,
bespectacled director and fellow student at Playhouse West, a school
and repertory theater founded by Jeff Goldblum and Robert Carnegie.</TE>
<TE>   This being L.A., Bennett began working through her confusion three
years ago with the help of film therapy. She began to write about her
sordid experiences and those of other people she knew who found
themselves suddenly single, and she teamed with Barrial to turn it
all into a movie. "I think watching the downward spiral of somebody
is quite fascinating," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly whose downward spiral you're watching on screen, however,
is hazier than one might think. "someBody" isn't exactly a
re-creation of Bennett's experiences. The filmmakers prefer calling
it "a re-exploration" because they incorporated and encouraged
spontaneity on the set.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Bennett is Samantha, and some of Samantha's lovers
were actually Bennett's, and some were also actors at Playhouse West,
although she won't identify which ones.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the heavily improvisational techniques of the
Playhouse West school, Bennett and Barrial distilled her writings
into an outline and then asked the actors to improvise scenes and
interviews that comment on the action. The results sometimes
surprised them.</TE>
<TE>   "We really asked the actors to open up their souls and talk"
during the interview segments, Bennett says. "We said, 'This is your
character, but if you want to bring in something that's really
happening in your life, we won't know if it's real or false.' So
everybody took big risks and went to places that were embarrassing
and humiliating, and the actors allowed themselves to go there."</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to speak in terms of characters because I didn't
want any sense of phoniness coming into it," Barrial says. With a
foundation in the Sanford Meisner philosophy of naturalistic acting,
he adds, "What Playhouse West was about was figuring out how to
approach a scene by exploring your own life. We just tried to take
that a little further. I'm not interested in characters, like
[telling them to] come in with a limp. We picked people because of
who they were."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences will probably note echoes of "sex, lies and videotape,"
Steven Soderbergh's seminal hybrid of documentary and narrative
styles of telling an intimate story. Barrial also says he was
inspired by the Dogma 95 filmmakers who use digital technology,
hand-held cameras and available light to present stories raw with
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "SomeBody" does depict a decidedly unromantic view of the quest
for romance. Characters grovel out of control, stalk each other by
phone or foot, abandon their friends and reduce lovers to body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we decided at the very beginning that we had
to be brutally honest in the rawest, truest sense is because this was
a very small-budget movie--$5,000," Bennett says. "So in order for us
to make something good and not care about the production value, we
had to do something that was really, really honest so you'd get
involved in the story."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett and Barrial received funding from Next Wave Films, an
Independent Film Channel company, to finish the movie and take it to
Sundance last year, where it was the first entry to be digitally shot
and projected in competition. After Sundance, Next Wave gave them
more money to transfer "someBody" to film, bringing the total
contribution to more than $100,000. Lot 47 Films is releasing it in
six cities.</TE>
<TE>   The movie has received mixed reviews, ranging from the New York
Observer's Andrew Sarris, who called Bennett "worth watching," to the
Washington Post's Nicole Arthur, who said it's "as vulgar as it is
banal."</TE>
<TE>   Whether "someBody" lifts Bennett and Barrial above the fray of
L.A.'s huge army of young filmmakers remains to be seen. After
Sundance, they took a lot of meetings, and Barrial is attached to
direct an as-yet unfunded project for Spike Lee's production company,
40 Acres and a Mule.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the two are keeping their day jobs: Barrial is now a
substitute teacher and Bennett is contemplating her own return to the
blackboard.</TE>
<TE>   Says Barrial: "I think people in the industry had to go, 'There's
no three-act structure, there's no happy ending.' It doesn't
necessarily fit into that industry thing of, 'Come on in, you make
the kind of movie we make.' That's been a stumbling block. But what's
good about digital technology is, if you want to make movies, you
can."</TE>

<LD>Uncle Vanya--Anyone who has ever doubted that a Chekhov play can be a
categorical hoot should rush to see "Uncle Vanya" at the Met.
Originally done in workshop by the Classical Theatre Lab, this
version of "Vanya," which played a limited engagement at the Actors'
Gang earlier this year, is simple, streamlined and stripped of all
but the most essential technical rudiments. In the context of this
bare-bones, physical staging, director Bruce Katzman devotes his
attention to pacing and nuance, bringing forth Chekhov's evanescent
humor with apparent effortlessness.... Katzman has assembled a
near-perfect cast that attacks the play with both delicacy and vigor.
An especially effective Orson Bean plays his buffoonish character cut
and dried and close to the bone, and he is all the more hilarious for
that.</LD>

<HD>Fox, CBS: Seven New Series Each</HD>
<DH>Television* Fox, trying to replace 'The X-Files,' makes
Sunday comedy night; CBS' new dramas include 'CSI: Miami.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Both Fox and CBS have finalized fall prime-time lineups featuring
seven new series, with Fox seeking to fill gaps left by the departure
of "Ally McBeal" and "The X-Files" while CBS rolls the dice with an
hour of comedy Sundays after "60 Minutes" and a spinoff of "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation" to follow its popular Monday sitcom block.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, which presents its schedule today to advertisers in New York,
is coming off a disappointing season ratings-wise. The network will
seek to replace the long-running "X-Files" by transforming Sunday
into an all-comedy night, with two new live-action shows joining
"Malcolm in the Middle" and the animated trio of "Futurama," "The
Simpsons" and "King of the Hill."</LD>
<LD>   As for "Ally," "Girls Club," from "Ally" creator David E. Kelley,
about three young female attorneys in San Francisco, is charged with
supplanting the producer's previous creation, paired with Kelley's
returning "Boston Public."</LD>
<TE>   The new Fox comedies are "Oliver Beene," about a dysfunctional
family during the Cold War; "The Grubbs," starring Randy Quaid as a
blue-collar dad; and "The Cedric Show," a sketch comedy featuring
Cedric the Entertainer, best-known for "The Steve Harvey Show" and a
series of beer commercials. The last will follow "The Bernie Mac
Show," which slides down to 8 p.m. Wednesdays, sparing the Peabody
Award-winning sitcom from competing with NBC's "The West Wing" at 9
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   That chore falls instead to "Fast Lane," an updated buddy cop
drama (it's been called an interracial "Starsky and Hutch") with a
fast-paced visual style provided by video and "Charlie's Angels" film
director McG.</TE>
<TE>   The other new hourlong shows are "John Doe," about a man with
amnesia who knows virtually everything except his own origins; and
"Firefly," a science-fiction series set aboard a spaceship, from
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss Whedon, though the prototype
will reportedly undergo some serious creative revision.</TE>
<TE>   "Dark Angel," a 2-year-old sci-fi property from "Titanic" director
James Cameron, failed to make the fall schedule. Fox has also
canceled the first-year comedies "Greg the Bunny," "That '80s Show"
and "Undeclared," as well as the longer-running "Titus." "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe," which made its debut this spring, is
expected to return as a midseason backup.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, meanwhile, announced plans to add five new dramas and bridge
the gap between "60 Minutes" and its Sunday movie with the new sitcom
"Bram and Alice," starring Alfred Molina, leading into the relocated
"Becker," with Ted Danson.</TE>
<TE>   Moving "Becker" opens a slot for "Still Standing," featuring Mark
Addy of "The Full Monty," on Monday nights, which CBS will close out
with the spinoff "CSI: Miami." During a press conference Wednesday,
CBS Television President Leslie Moonves stated that the network would
be "invincible on Monday" with "CSI" added in.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will offer a new medical show from "ER" producer John Wells,
"Presidio Med," at 10 p.m. Wednesdays, opposite another new medical
program, "Meds," on ABC. The network has also moved "The Agency" from
Thursdays to Saturdays in order to launch "Without a Trace," starring
Anthony LaPaglia as head of the FBI's missing-persons unit, after
"CSI," albeit versus NBC's still formidable "ER."</TE>
<TE>   CBS will also introduce two dramas Friday: "Hack," starring David
Morse as an ex-cop-turned-taxi-driver, which is being compared to
"The Equalizer"; and "RHD/LA," about the LAPD's robbery-homicide
unit, with Tom Sizemore. The latter comes from director Michael Mann,
who dominated the 10 p.m. Friday slot in the 1980s as the producer of
"Miami Vice." The news program "48 Hours" will lead off the night,
though Dan Rather will no longer host it.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing the competition, Moonves said NBC had "played it
conservatively," with relatively few scheduling changes because of
its success this season. Of ABC's overhauled roster, he said, "I
don't quite know what to make of that schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Here is CBS' fall schedule (new shows in italic):</TE>
<TE>   Sunday: "60 Minutes," "Bram and Alice," "Becker," Movie.</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "King of Queens," "Yes, Dear," "Everybody Loves Raymond,"
"Still Standing," "CSI: Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "JAG," "The Guardian," "Judging Amy."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "60 Minutes II," "The Amazing Race," "Presidio Med."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: "Survivor," "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," "Without a
Trace."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "48 Hours Investigates," "Hack," "RHD/LA."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday: "Touched by an Angel," "The District," "The Agency."</TE>
<TE>   Here is Fox's fall schedule:</TE>
<TE>   Sunday: "Futurama," "Oliver Beene," "The Simpsons," "King of the
Hill," "Malcolm in the Middle," "The Grubbs."</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "Boston Public," "Girls Club."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "That '70s Show," "Grounded for Life," "24."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "Bernie Mac," "The Cedric Show," "Fast Lane."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Movies/specials.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "John Doe," "Firefly."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday: "Cops," "America's Most Wanted."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Strand</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* So light--the expression "it melts in your mouth" couldn't be more
appropriate for a souffle.</LD>
<LD>   Off Vine: This charming old Craftsman bungalow has three choices,
raspberry, Grand Marnier and bittersweet chocolate, all served with
whipped cream. Maybe the secret of the fluffy texture is
hand-whipping the eggs. (All souffles, $6.95.) Off Vine, 6263 Leland
Way, Hollywood, (323) 962-1900.</LD>
<LD>   Moustache Cafe: Gorgeous, ample, very light souffles have been a
trademark here for 25 years. They're available in dark chocolate and
Grand Marnier flavors, or a combo of both. Souffles come with whipped
cream. (Souffles, $6.50.) Moustache Cafe, 8155 Melrose Ave., Los
Angeles, (323) 651-2111; 1071 Glendon Ave., Westwood, (310) 208-6633.</LD>
<TE>   The Ritz: Chef Salvatore Troia makes tall, puffy souffles, either
dark chocolate or Grand Marnier flavored with vanilla and orange and
lemon zest. Dusted with powdered sugar, they look like snow-capped
mountains. (Souffle, $8.) The Ritz, Fashion Island, 880 Newport
Center Drive, Newport Beach, (949) 720-1800.</TE>
<TE>   The Bistro Garden: This kitchen has used the same recipe for
nearly 40 years. When the chocolate souffle is served in its elegant
china ramekin, the waiter pokes a hole in it and spoons whipped cream
into the cavity. (Chocolate souffle, $7.) The Bistro Garden at
Coldwater, 12950 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 501-0202.</TE>
<TE>   Regent Beverly Wilshire: Pastry chef Lee Smith makes pillowy
souffles big enough to split. The Valrhona chocolate comes with
bittersweet chocolate sauce, the raspberry with raspberry coulis and
the Grand Marnier with creme anglaise laced with orange zest. And if
you'd like a little whipped cream or ice cream on the side, just ask.
(Souffles, $10.) Regent Beverly Wilshire, 9500 Wilshire Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, (310) 275-5200.</TE>
<TE>   La Cachette: Chef-owner Jean-Francois Meteigner likes to surprise
diners by putting a layer of brandied cherries on the bottom of his
chocolate souffle. This souffle is not overly sweet but a bit denser
than most, almost like a tart. It comes with vanilla sauce and
whipped cream. (Souffle, $14.) La Cachette, 10506 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Century City, (310) 470-4992.</TE>

<LD>   Lynne Cheney and Eminem Face Off</LD>
<LD>   Bad-boy rap artist Eminem lobs an obscenity at Vice President Dick
Cheney's wife on his upcoming album "The Eminem Show." Lynne Cheney,
a leading critic of violent lyrics in songs promoted by the recording
industry, singled out the Detroit-based singer in congressional
testimony in 2000, months before her husband was elected vice
president, and in numerous media interviews since then.</LD>
<TE>   In the yet-to-be-released track "White America," Eminem follows
the exclamation toward Cheney with the line "with the freeness of
speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow you to have."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney fired back through her spokeswoman, again condemning
Eminem's lyrics as a "glorification of violence" against women and
homosexuals. A spokesman for Interscope Records, a division of
Vivendi Universal, defended the singer. The song "addresses personal
attacks against him, his music and his right to artistic expression,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rapper's third major-label release is due out June 4.</TE>

<TE>   Small-Screen Diversity: A Long Way to Go</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 vow by the major TV networks to include more minorities in
prime-time series has largely gone unfulfilled, according to an
analysis by Children Now, a research and advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "Fall Colors 2001-02," the group's third-annual study of
prime-time programming, examined the first two episodes of each
evening series airing last fall on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB.
Its findings, released Wednesday, said the networks are "telling the
same old tale," in which younger white males predominate, ethnic
actors are relegated to supporting roles, and female characters are
often stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   Shows in the sitcom-dominated 8 p.m. hour--when young viewers do
most of their prime-time viewing--tend to be the most segregated on
prime-time TV, Children Now reported. Only 7% of comedies had
ethnically diverse starring casts, compared with 14% a year earlier,
it said.</TE>

<TE>   Allen Shuns Notion of Boycotting France</TE>
<TE>   Woody Allen said Wednesday that he disagrees strongly with an ad
from an American Jewish group that asks Americans to reconsider
attending the Cannes Film Festival in light of recent anti-Semitic
outbursts in France.</TE>
<TE>   The ad, placed in Hollywood trade papers last week by the American
Jewish Congress, does not call for an out-and-out boycott of the
festival, which opened Wednesday, but says those who attend should do
so only if they'll speak out against anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in it," Allen said at a news conference in
Cannes. "I've never felt the French people were in any way
anti-Semitic."</TE>
<TE>   During a radio interview earlier in the day, Allen, who is Jewish,
went even further. "I think any boycott is wrong," he said. "Boycotts
were exactly what the Germans were doing against the Jews."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne Bobbitt  was removed from Wednesday night's taping of
Fox's "Celebrity Boxing 2" after he was arrested for allegedly
beating his wife in their Las Vegas home.... 20th Century Fox is
reinventing the Charlie Chan franchise, with Lucy Liu ("Charlie's
Angels") playing the lead character, a detective named Charlie after
her grandfather.... Winona Ryder will host the season finale of
"Saturday Night Live" this weekend, with Moby as musical guest.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in "Snow Dogs," a
lightweight, ungainly farce in which he plays Dr. Ted Brooks, serene
ruler over a Miami chain of dental clinics. One day, he is served
with legal papers requiring that he fly to a tiny town in Alaska to
collect an inheritance. This development leads to the revelation that
he is adopted and sends him north grasping for roots and purpose in a
remote Alaskan village. What he finds is a village of eccentrics and
grotesques mimeographed from a rejected episode of "Northern
Exposure," and a sled dog team of huskies that is part of the
inheritance. With James Coburn, Sisqo and Nichelle Nichols. Directed
by Brian Levant.</LD>

<HD>New Look at a 'Body' of Work</HD>
<DH>Tim Miller paints more shading into his revived writings.</DH>

<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unmistakable punch of rediscovery accompanies the valedictory
jabs and thrusts that Tim Miller delivers in "Body Blows," his final
Highways premiere before he and partner Alistair McCartney leave
stateside at year's end (due to the ongoing immigration issues
recounted in Miller's 1999 "Glory Box").</LD>
<LD>   In description, "Body Blows" sounds like retread, refracting
excerpts from Miller's same-titled published collection of solo
works. In execution, however, it is easily this notorious gay
performance icon's most mature, elegant and purposefully
self-circumspective work to date.</LD>
<LD>   The seamlessly realized selections have been freshly retrofitted
with new material, and the effect is mesmerizing. Merely the addition
of Leonard Whiting footage to the wonderful "My Queer Body" account
of a disastrous teenage date finds vintage Miller reinvigorated, and
the new-minted "rainbow bridge" imagery of the finale is a
masterstroke.</LD>
<TE>   The trademark props and nudity are virtually absent, replaced by
an exemplary restraint that affords Miller's self-as-palette deeper
emotional pull than ever before. This registers in audience reaction,
the house falling raptly silent as often as it explodes with
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   And when Miller drops inward focus to establish direct contact, as
in the indelible "Naked Breath" passage concerning a grisly Brooklyn
carpentry mishap, his subtle communicative urgency is heart-stopping.
Such genuine commitment to underlying larger meaning typifies the
watershed nature of "Body Blows," and distinguishes the
still-evolving spiritual warrior who so beautifully inhabits it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Monica. Friday-Saturday, 8:30 p.m. Ends Saturday. $15. (310)

<LD>Bosc on His Own: Silvio de Mori has split with his longtime partner,
chef Jean-Pierre Bosc. Bosc is in the process of buying out De Mori's
interest in Mimosa, the French bistro on Beverly Boulevard in L.A.,
and Cafe des Artistes on McCadden Place in Hollywood. Bosc now cooks
at Mimosa nightly (Oliver de Mori, Silvio's son, remains the maitre
d' at Cafe des Artistes).</LD>
<LD>   That's De Mori: Silvio de Mori, meanwhile, has just opened a
restaurant on his own, this time an Italian one, called simply De
Mori. It's in a somewhat cursed location in Beverly Hills' Rodeo
Collection, the one that last housed the cowboy-cuisine restaurant
Reata. De Mori takes up only half the space that Reata did, but does
have the whole patio area. Silvio also wangled free parking from the
landlord. Opening chef David Giani is no longer with the project,
however. As for the menu, Silvio tells us, "It's mama's cooking ....I
want to prepare the pasta like at home." Give de Mori a few weeks to
find its direction. It's serving lunch and dinner Tuesday through
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   * De Mori, the Rodeo Collection, 421 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly
Hills; (310) 274-1500.</LD>
<TE>   Pass on Sea Bass: The "Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass" campaign
has hit L.A. Already underway in San Francisco, this movement by the
National Environmental Trust aims to keep the Patagonian toothfish
(known as Chilean sea bass until 10 years ago) from being fished into
extinction. So you won't see it at Lucques on Melrose, Chaya
Brasserie in L.A., Chaya Venice, any King's Fish House location, I
Cugini in Santa Monica, Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica,
Clearwater Seafood in Pasadena, Water Grill downtown, 555 East
Steakhouse in Long Beach or Royale in San Diego. King's Seafood fish
market in Glendale has also stopped stocking it. For more
information, visit the National Environmental Trust's Web site,
www.environet. policy.net/marine/csb/.</TE>
<TE>   Medieval Nouvelle: On Sunday, the American Institute of Wine &amp;
Food is putting on an evening of creative interpretations of 14th-
and 15th-century dishes by leading L.A. chefs. The Pageant of the
Chefs begins at 5 p.m. with roving appetizers and wine, accompanied
by jugglers, jesters and madrigals. The chefs cooking the five-course
meal are Lee Hefter of Spago, Raphael Lunetta of JiRaffe, Terri
Buzzard of the Restaurant at the Getty Center, Michael Cimarusti of
Water Grill, Suzanne Goin of Lucques and Nancy Silverton of
Campanile, with breads from Buona Forchetta Bakery. It will all
happen at the Pasadena Masonic Temple, 200 S. Euclid Ave., Pasadena.
The pageant is a fund-raiser to create culinary scholarships for
underprivileged teens; tickets are $225. Contact Roberta Mitchell of
the AIWF at (818) 902-3724.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless Care Fund-Raiser: Also on Sunday, Maple Drive hosts a
dinner to benefit Homeless Health Care Los Angeles, an organization
that provides healthcare services to homeless men, women and
children. Maple Drive's chef-owner Leonard Schwartz asked his
purveyors to donate meat, wine and produce for this event so that
more money would go directly to the charity. He'll make a
three-course meal for the night with passed hors d' oeuvres and
cocktails. Josh Groban will provide musical entertainment. The
evening begins at 6 p.m. The price is a $200 donation. Make your
reservation at (213) 741-0325.</TE>

<LD>The Visual Communications Film Fest 2002: The Los Angeles Asian
Pacific Film &amp; Video Festival opens tonight at the Directors Guild
with a gala premiere of Justin Lin's "Better Luck Tomorrow," a tale
of high school overachievers gone wrong. In addition to screenings at
the Directors Guild, the festival will run through May 23 at the
David Henry Hwang Theater in the Union Center for the Arts and the
Japan America Theater, both in Little Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   Bertha Bay-Sa Pan makes a formidable feature debut with "Face"
(DGA, Friday at 7:30 p.m.), which reveals the toll on Asians who must
maintain "face" at all costs in this triple portrait of three
generations of women. Bai Ling plays Kim, who grows up in Queens in
the '70s, chafing at the restraints of her loving but traditional
mother (Kieu Chinh) and winds up forced into a marriage with a rich
playboy who gets her drunk and pregnant. Eventually fleeing from her
husband to Hong Kong, where she becomes a banker, Kim returns home
many years later to confront the teenage daughter (Kristy Wu) who has
never known her and who is preoccupied with a new romance with a
sensitive young African American (Treach). Pan elicits beautiful
performances from the actresses playing the three women.</LD>
<TE>   Yaguchi Shinobu's "Water Boys" (DGA, Friday at 9:30 p.m.) is a
giddy comedy about a high school swim team that gets a new coach
("Shall We Dance?" instructor Naoto Takanaka) who announces, to the
boys' dismay, that she's turning the team into a synchronized
swimming troupe. What comes next is consistently amusing, and the
film is a zany delight.</TE>
<TE>   Several outstanding documentaries have dealt with the fate of
original Hawaiians and their culture as well as with the ecology of
the 50th state. Kathryn Xian and Brent Anbe's "Ke Kulana He Mahu:
Remembering a Sense of Place" (David Henry Hwang Theater, Monday at 7
p.m.) also deals with these issues, but their focus is on gays.</TE>
<TE>   This thoughtful documentary makes clear that the old Hawaiian
culture was all-accepting and that gays even had a special status as
healers. The fate of gays when Hawaii fell under U.S. rule and
domination becomes symbolic for all Hawaiians in this rueful but
hopeful look at the past. (213) 680-4462.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque's Alternative Screen showcase presents
tonight at 7:30 Marlo Poras' "Mai's America," which charts the
experiences of a vivacious 16-year-old Vietnamese exchange student.
She is highly articulate in English, has come to America for her
senior year of high school and hopes to continue on to college.</TE>
<TE>   In Hanoi, Mai says she wants to see the "America of all the movies
I grew up with" but instead experiences slices of life that many
Americans do not encounter. First, she lands in a small, rural
Mississippi town with a working-class family who are polite but
increasingly distant. Then, after six months, she finds a much better
situation with a young black couple.</TE>
<TE>   At school she is fortunate to have a progressive-thinking history
teacher and is delighted when two of the most popular girls in school
befriend her, only to discover they're a pair of airheads. Mai does
make friends and comes into contact with other Vietnamese, but her
life becomes increasingly grueling. As one young Detroit Vietnamese
emigre tells her, "Life in America is really harder than in Vietnam."
This sensitive, observant documentary proves bittersweet in the
fullest sense of the word. Playing with "Mai's America" is Chris
Strother's evocative 10-minute "Candy Money," in which Strother
follows her 12-year-old cousin Jeremy and his best pal, A.J., as they
spend a summer day in rural Arkansas earning money for some
convenience store treats.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, the Cinematheque will present The Lovecraft Quartet:
A Tribute to Stuart Gordon, with a double feature each evening. After
each bill, director Gordon will discuss the films with the audience.
"Re-Animator" (1985), the first of Gordon's adaptations of H.P.
Lovecraft, opens the series Friday at 7:30 p.m. at the Egyptian. When
it was first released, it was the funniest Grand Guignol horror
picture to come along in ages. Winner of a special critics' prize at
Cannes, it was clear it could become a classic of the genre like "The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and enjoy a long life as a cult film.</TE>
<TE>   "You haven't done this on people?" medical student Bruce Abbott
asks of his new roommate, Jeffrey Combs, who's shot up Abbott's dead
cat with a mysterious phosphorescent chartreuse substance that has
turned the poor creature into a rampaging attack cat. But Combs, a
fresh transfer from a Zurich medical school--never mind why he
departed--is a genius teetering on madness and determined to conquer
brain death. The only trouble is that the dead, animal or human, are
brought back to life as zombies and Combs' experiments lurch out of
control. Adapted by Dennis Paoli and William J. Norris from a 1922
Lovecraft story, it's a real throat-grabber that holds on tight from
first frame to last. "Re-Animator" will be followed by "From Beyond"
(1986). Combs and Barbara Crampton, who starred in both films, will
appear with Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   The series concludes Saturday starting with the 6:30 p.m. Los
Angeles premiere of the brand-new "Dagon," which the Cinematheque
describes as a "fish-zombie spectacular," followed by the 1995
"Castle Freak," which re-teamed Combs and Crampton as a couple who
have inherited a haunted Italian castle. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Janice Beard," a relentlessly tedious comedy, opens Friday at the
Music Hall in Beverly Hills. Eileen Walsh makes her feature debut in
the title role as the waiflike but determinedly cheerful and
fantasizing office temp. She wants to earn enough money to afford a
cure for the agoraphobia that has gripped her mother since she saw
her husband drop dead as she gave birth to her daughter. This
irrepressible heroine innocently becomes entangled in industrial
espionage. Walsh is tiresome, as is everything about this artificial
and under-inspired film. (310) 474-6869.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' weekend series Erotic Tales, composed of
three vignettes from different directors, continues at the Sunset 5
on Friday and Saturday at midnight and Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m.
Nicolas Roeg's "Hotel Paradise" is a sexy fable in which a
champagne-sodden woman (Theresa Russell) awakes in a sybaritic hotel
suite wearing only a bridal veil, one hand handcuffed to the
bedstead--and a man (Vincent D'Onofrio) she does not recognize asleep
under the bedclothes. Dutch director Jos Stelling's sly and
suggestive "The Waiting Room" finds a good-looking man of about 40
(Gene Bervoets) who, while waiting for his plump wife (Annet
Malherbe) to find coffee, crudely leers at various women in a crowded
railway waiting room. They are all offended until a stunning, leggy
goddess returns his smile, with amusing consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Streitfeld brings a sunny light touch to the erotic yet
sweet "The Summer of My Deflowering," in which a lovely young woman
(Beth Riesgraf), who has been keeping a video diary since childhood,
decides she wants to wrap it up with a record of her loss of
virginity. She has located a motel called Paradise, which has a
Garden of Eden suite. She recruits the perfect man (Martin
Henderson), who is under the impression he's helping her complete a
school project. Needless to say, she discovers that a matter-of-fact
approach about sex may not be the most effective. Streitfeld's story
is slender, but she has a sure sense of behavioral comedy and a
winning way with actors. (323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   This second program in the Erotic Tales series screens May 25-27
at 11 a.m. at the Monica 4-Plex, Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; June
1-2 at the Playhouse 7, Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; June 8-9 at the
Fallbrook 7, West Hills, (818) 340-8710.</TE>

<LD>* The Exonerated (Actors' Gang Theatre, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood, [323] 465-0566, Ext. 15). Skillfully weaving the riveting
real-life dramas (told in their own words) of six death-row inmates
freed by new evidence, this urgent piece avoids moral abstraction to
examine capital punishment and the justice system in painfully human
terms. Among the stars are Victoria Cunningham and Brian Powell,
above. Thu.-Sat., 8 p.m.; Sun., 2 p.m. (May 25, 8 p.m. show
sign-language interpreted.) Ends June 16. $20-$25; Thu. shows, pay
what you can.</LD>

<LD>While "Spider-Man" and the latest "Star Wars" film celebrate mythic
male heroes, Lifetime spotlights the everyday female kind tonight in
"Our Heroes, Ourselves" (7 p.m.). Marlo Thomas executive produced and
hosts the show, in which four women look back on a moment that
changed their lives.</LD>
<LD>   After shrimper Diane Wilson read that her tiny Texas county had
the nation's highest rate of toxic disposal, she launched a crusade
to get companies to reduce the waste they discharge into the bay of
San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   For Maria Gomez Murphy, the childhood memory of a sign, "No
Mexicans or dogs allowed," turned her into a fighter. Now she helps
Mexican Americans in Nogales, Ariz., gain access to health care
through her group, the Way of the Heart.</LD>
<TE>   As a teen, Isis Sapp-Grant led a Brooklyn girl gang, but when a
dying comrade told her, "You know, Isis, you can do better than
this," she tore herself away from that life. Now a social worker, she
helps others do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Jaki-Lyn Taylor, a scholarship student from Montana who lived in
40 foster homes, spoke at a congressional hearing about abuses in the
orphan care system. A senator taken by her courage hired Taylor, who
plans a career as a lobbyist for orphans.</TE>
<TE>   As centerpiece of Lifetime's monthlong "Be Your Own Hero"
campaign, this show should serve its purpose by inspiring others.</TE>

<HD>The Automated Andy Warhol Is Reprogrammed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL RIDENOUR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Museum of Contemporary Art primps this month for the only
American exhibition of the Andy Warhol retrospective, another Warhol
sits on the sidelines, a twin in Chatsworth ready to leave home as
soon as his programming is complete.</LD>
<LD>   The resemblance is uncanny: the hair identically chopped, the mole
precisely placed and the skin equally pasty, even if it is silicone.
Below the neckline, however, the celebrity likeness dissolves into a
tangle of hydraulic tubing, electronic actuators and aluminum bones.</LD>
<LD>   Fabricated in 1982 for a production that never left the ground,
this robotic Andy Warhol has lingered for 20 years at AVG, a firm
that designs and fabricates mechanical characters for movies, theme
parks and exhibitions. A deal was struck with a private collector
last month, and the robot is being prepped for the handoff. Alvaro
Villa, who worked for Disney Imagineering and founded AVG in 1978,
said he will miss his animatronic Andy, adding, "It's become a sort
of icon for the company."</LD>
<TE>   Villa says the Andy Warhol Museum in the artist's hometown of
Pittsburgh had expressed interest in acquiring the robot but made no
counteroffer when a private collector approached Villa unexpectedly.
Preferring not to give the amount of the sale, Villa says the buyer
disclosed little.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very mysterious," Villa says. "I honestly can't even tell
you his nationality because another person came to negotiate for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Museum director Thomas Sokolowski admits to a fascination with the
robot but says he is not convinced it would have been a good
investment. "It could distract from the experience of the paintings
rather than enhance it. Particularly for Americans today, a Madame
Tussaud's or robotic light show is far more exotic than any
painting."</TE>
<TE>   The mechanical figure was created as the star of a touring
multimedia stage production to be co-produced by Warhol and Broadway
impresario Lewis Allen. Tentatively titled "Andy Warhol's
Overexposed: A No-Man Show," the automated theatrical curiosity was
to have cost an estimated $1.25 million, but funds never
materialized. Sokolowski says the production was to have depicted the
artist's daily routine of sitting in bed while dictating his diaries
over the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Villa never saw a script and never got as far as programming the
lip-sync, but other functions are complete, including 54 movements
ranging from shrugging shoulders to a bobbing Adam's apple. He also
recalls preliminary discussions about making robotic dachshunds to
stand in for Warhol's pets, Amos and Archie.</TE>
<TE>   The yearlong process of creating the $400,000 robot-actor began
with the actor's visit, when his voice was recorded, his motion
videotaped and his body photographed from hundreds of angles. John
Davis, who then headed the company's sculpture department, recalls
Warhol enduring measurements with calipers and sitting for
photographs with stickers attached to the pivot point of his jaw. "He
was very patient and quiet," he says, "and I think I'd have to call
him shy." Castings were taken from Warhol's hands to duplicate detail
down to the fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   Using the photographic reference, Davis sculpted a head around
custom eyeballs and off-the-shelf teeth from a dental supplier. From
this, he created molds and cast rubber skins as well as a fiberglass
skull that would support the bonier parts of the face. A body with
removable panels was cast in plastic, and this hollow shell then went
to the AVG mechanics responsible for devising a motorized
musculature. The completed figure was then airbrushed, clothed and
topped with a Warhol-esque wig.</TE>
<TE>   So why didn't the robot see its 15 minutes of fame?</TE>
<TE>   Sokolowski says that investors could not be convinced that all
technical issues had been resolved. "Could the show pay for touring
costs? Would the robot break down? Would you have to pay 40
technicians to come along?" These, according to Sokolowski, were real
concerns, along with the fear that the robot's technological
sophistication would be outdated before the curtain ever rose.</TE>
<TE>   Robot's Monologue</TE>
<TE>   Was Never Created</TE>
<TE>   The no-man show, Sokolowski says, was the brainchild of director
Peter Sellars, who intended to write a script based on the artist's
diaries and two of his books, "The Philosophy of Andy Warhol" and
"Exposures." But Warhol never recorded a monologue and, after his
death in 1987, plans to have an actor read the lines or to edit
something from existing recordings by Warhol didn't materialize.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of casting a robot to play the artist may have been
sparked by Warhol, who declared in the 1960s that he would like to be
a robot or machine. "In many ways, it wasn't that great a stretch.
Just look at tapes of him being measured for the project," Sokolowski
says. "His movements are very wooden, almost robotic."</TE>
<TE>   As the robot was being built, Warhol was (in his own way)
enthusiastic, expressing the hope that his mechanical counterpart
could take over the burden of public appearances. The idea may have
been more than a joke to Warhol, who in 1967 hired his Factory crony
Alan Midgette, to impersonate him for a college lecture tour.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought as long as someone looked like Warhol and sounded like
Warhol, people didn't really care since they were having the Warhol
experience," Sokolowski says, noting that the artist's robot remark
could also be understood in terms of social programming.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at it as following all the patterns that our society made
for us: buying the right perfume or clothes to fit a particular
role." This sort of robotic obedience, he says, was hardly anathema
to Warhol. "He came from the wrong side of the tracks, and he himself
had to learn how to talk hip, be cool, fit in. He embraced that
process."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Warhol dubbed his studio the Factory, Sokolowski
says, also alludes to the artist's love of predictable mechanized
process. Repetitive behavior may, in fact, have been symptomatic of
his psychology.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not definitive, but we think he suffered from something
called Asperger Syndrome, a very, very mild form of autism. So the
fact that Warhol would do these repetitive things, like only eat one
food for lunch every day, wear exactly the same kind of underwear for
30 years or fiddle with a rosary in his pocket, is also significant
in that sense."</TE>
<TE>   As Warhol's mechanized double says goodbye to theatrical
aspirations, Villa is parting not only with a company icon, but also
with a useful model. After the original rubber skin deteriorated and
peeled away around the time of the artist's death, the exposed
high-tech skeleton went to work on TV, appearing as a background
extra in an episode of Warner Bros. "Lois and Clark" and in the
Discovery Channel documentary "Robots Rising."</TE>
<TE>   But its role as far as AVG is concerned is larger than that. Villa
explains by conducting a tour of the company's machine shop. Next to
a rack of bins, he points out something that looks like a robotic
anatomy chart, each bone and muscle coded with a number corresponding
to a particular bin.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a sort of standard design for human figures," he says,
pulling out a box that seems to be filled with metallic finger bones.
"Andy was the first sophisticated human figure built by the company,"
he says. "We refined his design over the years, but many of the parts
still come from him."</TE>
<TE>   AVG has created roughly 1,000 robots since 1978--dragons, singing
flowers, even industrial workers to sew for Singer--and among them
are many human-like descendants of Warhol, including an Albert
Einstein, a Wizard of Oz, a Sinbad and even a replica of the ghoulish
host of "Tales From the Crypt." So even if the animatronic Andy is
retiring to private life, little bits of Warhol will continue to be
dispersed around the globe, in AVG robots from Las Vegas to Tokyo to
Seoul.</TE>

<HD>Some Ghostly Chills and Gory Thrills on DVD</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>"The Others" is such a ripping good ghost story that one can almost
forgive the rather disappointing two-disc DVD (Dimension, $30). Where
is the audio commentary with director Alejandro Amenabar or star
Nicole Kidman? This is the type of a movie that shrieks out for a
commentary track.</LD>
<LD>   Kidman, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her
performance, headlines this atmospheric horror flick about a nervous
woman who lives with her two children in a spooky house without any
electricity on the secluded British island of Jersey. Her husband
went off to fight in World War II, and although the conflict has
ended, he has yet to return home. Her children have a rare disease
that prevents them from being exposed to light. When three servants
mysteriously arrive one morning for work, things start to go bump in
the night.</LD>
<LD>   The digital edition features a ho-hum featurette that was produced
for television and a short but interesting visual-effects featurette.
"Xeroderma Pigmentosum" is a good mini-documentary focusing on a real
family whose youngest daughter suffers from the disease afflicting
the children in the movie. Rounding out the disc is a
behind-the-scenes look at Amenabar, a 28-year-old Spanish director,
at work.</LD>
<TE>   Although "The Others" doesn't include many extras, Fox's two-disc
set of the gory thriller "From Hell" ($30) has too many. In fact, it
boasts six hours of "spine-tingling" extra features.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes, "From Hell" stars Johnny
Depp, Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm in a bloodcurdling
retelling of the infamous Jack the Ripper murders that took place in
London's Whitechapel district in the late 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   The discs, like the movie, are creepy. Especially gruesome is the
documentary "Jack the Ripper: Six Degrees of Separation," which
features the real morgue pictures of his victims and information on
the various suspects in the unsolved case. The Hughes brothers offer
a gleefully ghoulish "Tour of the Murder Sites" at the re-creation of
Whitechapel built near Prague.</TE>
<TE>   The discs also feature a pedestrian "HBO First Look" special with
Graham as host, an interesting glimpse into Martin Childs' production
design and an examination of the graphic novel on which the film is
based.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Hughes provides audio commentary for 20 deleted scenes and
an alternate ending. The main commentary track features the Hugheses
and Coltrane.</TE>
<TE>   The gore fest continues with the two-disc "millennium edition" of
the outrageous 1985 cult flick "Re-Animator" (Elite, $30). Based on
the stories by H.P. Lovecraft, "Re-Animator" is a gross but very
funny tale of a mad scientist (a perfectly cast Jeffrey Combs) who
wants to bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately, every time he
does, the dead become violent.</TE>
<TE>   The disc includes a commentary track with director Stuart Gordon,
who, before moving to horror films, operated the Organic Theater
Company in Chicago. There is also a breezy commentary track with
producer Brian Yuzna and actors Combs, Robert Sampson, Barbara
Crampton and Bruce Abbott. Also included: several extended scenes and
one deleted scene; new video interviews with Gordon, Yuzna, writer
Dennis Paoli, composer Richard Band and Fangoria magazine editor Tony
Timpone; multi-angle storyboards of three scenes; and a discussion of
the music in three scenes with Band.</TE>
<TE>   "The X-Files" wraps up its ninth and final season this Sunday.
Earlier this week, Fox released the fifth season of the Fox sci-fi
series on DVD ($150). The six-disc set features every episode of the
series, a 46-minute special (which originally aired on FX), and an OK
documentary that looks at several of the season's episodes. Also
included are interviews with creator Chris Carter and several of the
directors and writers.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen King's Rose Red," the six-hour ABC miniseries about a
haunted mansion, also made its DVD debut this week (Lions Gate, $25).
Critically lambasted but a ratings hit, the silly thriller stars
Nancy Travis, Matt Keeslar and the late David Dukes. The two-disc set
includes a documentary, storyboards and commentary from director
Craig Baxley.</TE>
<TE>   Happy trails to you: New from Hollywood Attic are the DVD ($20)
and VHS ($15) debut of the recently discovered and newly restored
uncut version of the lively "Cowboy and the Senorita," a 1944 musical
western that marked the first pairing of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
The DVD also features a tour of the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans museum,
production notes and musical highlights.</TE>
<TE>   Also available is "The Roy Rogers Television Collection: Pilots
and Rarities" (also from Hollywood Attic; DVD, $20; VHS, $15), a
collection of rare TV episodes including the Dale Evans series,
"Queen of the West," promotional film with the two, and a campy 1962
hourlong musical variety show with them from the Seattle World's
Fair.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar is hitting the trail with the six-flick DVD set
"John Wayne: The Duke" ($27), which features six of the fast-paced B
westerns Wayne did in the early '30s: "Desert Trail," "Paradise
Canyon," "The Trail Beyond," "Two-Fisted Law," "Riders of Destiny"
and "West of the Divide." Unfortunately, on five of the titles, the
original scores have been pulled and substituted with the same
annoying, repetitive music.</TE>
<TE>   Also from Columbia TriStar is the taut, well-acted 1958 sagebrush
saga "Cowboy" ($20). Jack Lemmon and Glenn Ford make a good team in
this western about a hard-drinking, hard-driving cattle boss who
loses his earnings in a poker game and ends up taking a $3,000 loan
from a Chicago hotel desk clerk. In return for the loan, the cattle
boss must take the tenderfoot on his next drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Marilyn Monroe: The Diamond Collection Volume II" (Fox, $20 each;
$44 for the set) shines the spotlight on five of the sex symbol's
films. Each film has been beautifully restored for the DVDs and
features a demonstration of the restoration process.</TE>
<TE>   The best of the lot is 1953's "Niagara," a nifty mystery in
Technicolor with Monroe just perfect as the adulterous wife of a
troubled World War II vet (Joseph Cotten).</TE>
<TE>   Monroe goes dramatic with decent results as a demented baby-sitter
in the enjoyable 1952 melodrama "Don't Bother to Knock," which also
stars the always-watchable Richard Widmark and a very young Anne
Bancroft.</TE>
<TE>   The actress' deft comedic flair is on display in the 1952 Howard
Hawks screwball comedy "Monkey Business," which stars Cary Grant,
Ginger Rogers and Charles Coburn.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe and co-star Robert Mitchum give it the old college try to
no avail in Otto Preminger's threadbare 1954 western, "River of No
Return." Rounding out the collection is the tired 1960 musical comedy
"Let's Make Love," which casts Monroe opposite French heartthrob Yves
Montand.</TE>

debut album, and 24 years since his only Top 10 album, "Excitable
Boy," the singer-songwriter still gets to make records when the mood
strikes, and perform live for a clutch of die-hard loyalists in
cities all over the country. What's not to like?</LD>
<LD>   "I've got the greatest job in the world," says Zevon, 55. "Even if
I'm scratching out a living, I know I can play this music on a guitar
in a bar for the rest of my life."</LD>
<LD>   This is not the disingenuous, faux-humble jive of a fat and
content rock star. Zevon, who emerged in the mid-'70s as the most
literate and subversive songwriter of the peaceful, easy L.A. cabal
that included Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne, has fallen from
grace so many times that it's like some bad cosmic joke. In 1981, he
appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. Now he operates well under
Carson Daly's radar and just does what strikes his fancy.</LD>
<TE>   Lately, that's involved collaborating on songs with writers as
disparate as crime novelist Carl Hiaasen, Irish poet Paul Muldoon,
bassist-producer Larry Klein and the great gonzo Hunter S. Thompson.
All contributed songs to Zevon's new album, "My Ride's Here," a
record that manages to be ebullient and barbed at the same time--a
familiar balancing act for Zevon. The key difference this time is
that most of the words aren't his.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time it's an awful, unnatural struggle for me to
write lyrics," says Zevon. "I think of it as a necessary evil. If it
gets business-like, I'm unhappy with the results. I have to wait for
some kind of inspiration, and that means a lot of extreme
frustration, because I'm not being useful."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Zevon turned to writers such as Hiaasen, the author of
"Strip Tease" and "Native Tongue" who also co-wrote songs for Zevon's
1995 album "Mutineer."</TE>
<TE>   "[R.E.M. guitarist] Peter Buck told me to read him," says Zevon.
"By the time I got to 'Native Tongue,' I was such a fan I bribed the
guy at the bookstore to sell me an advance copy. Then I looked in it
and I saw my name on the copyright page."</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen, as it turned out, was a Zevon fan. Now, the two go
fishing in the Florida Keys and write songs like "Basket Case," a
track on "My Ride's Here" that shares its title with Hiaasen's latest
book and a fictional record featured in the novel. "The song is
supposed to be the song of the rock band in the book," says Zevon.
"The lyrics are actually printed in the novel."</TE>
<TE>   The acclaimed Muldoon, who is the director of the creative writing
program at Princeton University, is another author who has bled his
ardor for Zevon into the pages of his work. In one poem featured in a
series called "Sleeve Notes," Muldoon professed his love for
"Excitable Boy." Zevon read it and contacted Muldoon about writing
with him. "We had lunch and I prevailed upon him to write some
songs," says Zevon. "He sent me his books, all of which I already
had."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon is the kind of voracious reader who will scour the city for
that perfect hardback edition of Conrad's "Nostromo," so the
opportunity to work with writers that he loves has been a fan's
dream. "Part of this rather savage criticism I've seen about the
album is that people think there is something deeply lazy about
collaborating with all these writers," says Zevon. "But the simple
answer is that I love singing their words."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Zevon's authorial collaborations have been so Tin Pan
Alley-smooth. Working with old friend Hunter Thompson, a man with a
legendary disdain for deadlines, has been an exercise in forbearance
for Zevon. "He will be utterly responsible if you need him to be,"
says Zevon. "If you show up at his place in Aspen at 2 a.m. with a
guitar, ready to write the lyrics, that might not be the night you'll
write the song. But by golly, he'll call you on the phone at 9 in the
morning six weeks later and start reciting lyrics."</TE>
<TE>   Zevon also wangled David Letterman into contributing some lusty
cheering to "Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)"--a selection that was
co-written with "Tuesdays With Morrie" author Mitch Albom.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of questions," says Zevon. "Like, 'What am I
supposed to be? A coach? A disgruntled fan?' But he did a bunch of
takes, and I asked him to do them a bit slower, and he says, 'Oh, now
it starts!'"</TE>

<HD>Pianist Alicia de Larrocha Pays Tribute to a Departed
Friend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a what's-right-with-this-picture scenario at Ventura College
Theater last week, when Alicia de Larrocha came to town. It's a rare
enough experience to hear a musician of her lofty stature in this
space, but it was an extra special event to catch the celebrated
Spanish pianist performing an all-Spanish program, including works
written for her or adapted by her. She was the star of this year's
Ventura Chamber Music Festival, and it's reasonable to say that this
was the zenith of the fest.</LD>
<LD>   At 78, De Larrocha is still very much a dexterous and insightful
player, wise in her interpretations and resistant to empty
flashiness. She brought a dancing crispness to the Baroque terrain of
a pair of Antonio Soler pieces to open a program which also included
selections from Isaac Albeniz's "Iberia" and a second half devoted to
the music of Enrique Granados. Granados' "Goyescas" music was
inspired by Goya paintings, and revised by the pianist. She gave full
measure of the music, which is plainly romantic but fortified with
Spanish flavors and rhythms.</LD>
<TE>   The main focus, and most memorable aspect of this program, though,
came with a personal poignancy attached. As a concert centerpiece,
she played works by a Spanish composer who deserves greater
recognition, Xavier Montsalvatge, a friend who would have turned 90,
but who died a week earlier. Under the circumstances, the concert
turned into a Montsalvatge tribute, replete with a short, bittersweet
encore written by him.</TE>
<TE>   His "Sonatina para Yvette" and "Impromptu en el Generalife,"
written for de Larrocha, have a post-Impressionistic flair, but with
enough points of tension and wit along the way to keep the mind alert
and guessing. Before leaving the stage at intermission, she came out
and quietly held up one of the composer's scores, in tribute to the
artist. Her greatest homage, of course, came through her magic
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Art Alert: Looking for art this weekend? Check out the current
fare in Oxnard's Carnegie Art Museum., Through Sunday, the museum is
hosting a subtly fascinating traveling exhibition, "American
Woodblock Prints," from the Syracuse University art collection.</TE>
<TE>   In the woodblock medium, lines and forms tend to be etched in
strength more than subtlety, and the American-ness of the art here
extends from "American Gothic"-esque values to experimental
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   * "American Woodblock Prints" and Donald Cecil's "The California
Landscape," Carnegie Art Museum, 424 S. C St., Oxnard, through
Sunday. Gallery hours: 10 a.m.-5 p.m., today and Saturday; 11
a.m.-5:30 p.m., Friday; 1 p.m.-5 p.m., Sunday. (805) 385-8157.</TE>

<LD>An Alaska Airlines jet made an unscheduled landing at Los Angeles
International Airport on Wednesday after an unexplained series of
shudders shook the plane over Mexico, airlines officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The 97 passengers were transferred to another plane as mechanics
and airframe experts began studying the twin-engine MD-80. Jack
Evans, a spokesman for Alaska, said the problem appeared to be with
the airframe rather than any of the control surfaces.</LD>
<LD>   Flight 212 from Long Beach to Mazatlan, Mexico, had just crossed
into Mexican airspace when the shaking began, Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, an Alaska MD-80 series jet en route from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle crashed into the ocean
off Ventura County, killing all 88 on board.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say the plane crashed after its horizontal
stabilizer, a control surface in the tail, broke off.</TE>

<HD>Palmdale Sees Return of Apartments</HD>
<DH>Development: The first project proposed after a two-year
moratorium faces opposition. Ban had been imposed after glut led to
blight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since Palmdale lifted its two-year ban on new
apartments, a developer has stepped forward with plans for a complex
in the heart of Rancho Vista, an affluent neighborhood of
single-family homes.</LD>
<LD>   Developer Andrew J. Eliopulos of Lancaster has promised that his
$3.6-million complex of 90 apartments will be classy, with tile roofs
and attractive landscaping. The proposal calls for 10 apartment
buildings and a community center.</LD>
<LD>   But opponents say they fear increased crime, decreasing property
values and overburdened schools.</LD>
<TE>   They remember the glut of apartments built during the 1980s, when
land was cheap and development was rampant. And they remember when
recession hit the next decade, and whole neighborhoods fell into
disrepair because landlords couldn't afford to keep up their
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, neighboring Lancaster was spending millions to raze
run-down apartments in a project called Operation High Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, both Palmdale and Lancaster had imposed
moratoriums on apartments in order to tighten their zoning laws and
limit the number of neighborhoods where apartments were allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancaster ban was lifted in 2000 and Palmdale's was lifted
last year. The proposed apartment complex, which would be on six
acres at Rancho Vista Boulevard and Avenue O-8, is allowed based on
the neighborhood's current density limits.</TE>
<TE>   The city staff has recommended that the Planning Commission
approve the project at its next meeting, scheduled for 6 p.m. today
at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents who oppose the plan have been passing out fliers,
printing anti-apartment T-shirts and going door-to-door drumming up
support.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner Will Aitchison, 35, has been at the forefront of the
anti-apartment fight. He moved to Palmdale five years ago after
deciding Van Nuys was too dense--and too unsafe--for raising
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got three kids under 5, and I'm really concerned about
this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Robert "Bo" Bynum said he hasn't decided how
he will vote.</TE>
<TE>   But he also is worried about crowding at the schools, citing a
letter from the Westside Union School District that there is "no room
left in existing schools" to absorb new growth.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment proposal comes as lawmakers around the state are
being asked to rethink urban planning strategies.</TE>
<TE>   With Southern California expected to grow from about 16 million to
nearly 22 million people in the next 20 years, planners at the
Southern California Assn. of Governments are pushing for plans that
increase density in urban centers--plans they believe will cut
commutes and reduce sprawl. Gov. Gray Davis supports a controversial
bill in the state Senate that would offer incentives to local
governments who set such goals.</TE>
<TE>   Once a dusty outpost of alfalfa farms and ranches, the commuter
suburb of Palmdale has grown into an urban center of its own, with a
population 116,000. Many were lured by the promise of affordable
homeownership, and houses remain the norm: Just 20% of the city's
40,000 dwellings are multifamily units.</TE>
<TE>   Eliopulos said he also is considering building a 200-unit complex
in the neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Seeks to Block Blake's Use of P.I.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles prosecutors have asked a judge to stop actor Robert
Blake's defense attorney from hiring an investigator they say could
be a witness in Blake's murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi say private
investigator William C. Jordan could provide "valuable evidence
tending to implicate" Blake in the fatal shooting of his wife, Bonny
Lee Bakley, on May 4, 2001, near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan said in an interview Wednesday that he met with Blake's
attorney Harland W. Braun for three hours last week to review the
prosecution's case against Blake.</LD>
<TE>   He said prosecutors have exaggerated what his role would be as a
witness. He described the information he has provided to authorities
as "innocuous."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said Blake hired him in September 2000 to do a background
check on Bakley in anticipation of child custody proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Jordan can testify about Blake's plans to end his
stormy marriage with Bakley and take custody of their child, Rose,
now almost 2. Prosecutors say Blake called Jordan within hours of the
Bakley killing, but they did not elaborate on that conversation.</TE>
<TE>   In their motion filed late Tuesday, Dixon and Dohi describe
Jordan's involvement with the defense as "yet another dubious
financial arrangement" between Blake and a potential prosecution
witness with "the glaring potential for corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Blake is paying the lawyer representing Earle Caldwell, his
bodyguard and co-defendant, and put up $1 million last month to bail
Caldwell out of jail. Blake, 68, is being held without bail at Men's
Central Jail downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, prosecutors asked Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash to remove defense attorney Arna H. Zlotnik
from the case because she is being paid by Blake to represent
Caldwell. Nash is expected to consider both prosecution motions at a
hearing Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities last month charged Blake with murdering his wife, two
counts of solicitation, and conspiracy. Caldwell, 46, was charged
with conspiracy. Both men pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said there is no legal basis for the motion pertaining to
Jordan and challenged what he views as the prosecutors' efforts to
shape the defense case.</TE>
<TE>   "[Dist. Atty.] Steve Cooley does not pick who the attorneys are
for the defense. He does not pick who posts bail for the defendants,"
Braun said. "And he's not going to decide who our investigators are
and how many investigators we have." Braun said he hired Jordan
because he is an expert in homicide cases. Before accepting the job,
Jordan said he notified LAPD detectives and consulted his attorney.
"In essence, they said they were not thrilled about it, but there was
nothing illegal about it," he said.</TE>

news conference on community policing. Neighborhood parents are
urging police to step up enforcement efforts after an increase in
homicides in the area. Hahn has pledged to bring senior lead officers
back to the field as community liaisons; in 1997, many officers from
the program were reassigned to patrol duty, and residents in many
areas demanded that the liaison program be reinstituted. Boyle
Heights leaders have asked the LAPD to institute incentives for
officers who perform outstanding community police work.</CP>

<HD>Mural to Honor Efforts of Chinese Firefighters</HD>
<DH>History: Ventura council approves $8,000 to help create a
wall memorial to the fire brigade that protected China Alley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in 1889, the Ventura fire department was loath to respond to
fires in the city's small Chinatown, so its residents were forced to
start their own Chinese fire brigade.</LD>
<LD>   The brigade--which was based in China Alley, home to about 200
immigrants--was known to sometimes beat the city's fire company to
fires outside the alley.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the City Council has approved building a landmark that will
honor the contributions of the fire brigade and all Chinese
immigrants to Ventura. On Monday, the council unanimously decreed
that a wall on Figueroa Street be dedicated to the memorial. It will
feature a red pagoda adorned with a dragon that frames a mural of the
fire brigade.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a small effort for the people who've made such a large
contribution," said Councilman Sandy Smith at Monday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The council also allocated $8,000 in city funds to help build the
memorial. The Ventura County Chinese American Historical Society will
raise matching funds to complete the tribute and will recruit
volunteers to build it.</TE>
<TE>   S.K. Leong of Westlake, the chief fund-raiser for the society,
said that he doesn't anticipate any problems in raising the $8,000.
No timeline has yet been set for construction, nor has a deadline
been set for raising the funds. But Leong said he and the society are
ready to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Louie of Camarillo is a descendant of China Alley residents.
Her grandfather, Charley Yee, was entrusted with the key to the shed
that housed the fire engine and was responsible for opening its doors
when blazes broke out. He lived just a few doors from the fire shed,
near where Louie's mother spent her childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "These people worked really, really hard, and came over with
nothing but dreams, and tried to make things better for future
generations," Louie said of her Chinese ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   "And a lot of people don't even know that there was a Chinatown in
Ventura," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The society has been working for about a year to initiate the
memorial. "We wanted more than just a plaque," Louie said.</TE>
<TE>   K.C. Ling, a member of the historical society, on Monday urged the
council to approve the project.</TE>
<TE>   "They provided support to the community and left an indelible
legacy," Ling said. "This is only a small step to recognize the
multicultural society we have."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Smith agreed, saying that he would like to eventually
see an effort to re-create China Alley, a larger tribute that could
also attract tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Leong found those words encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "They've shown lots of commitment," Leong said of the council
members. "We hope they will take the next step to do something on an
even greater scale."</TE>

<HD>West Meets East's Commuter Woes</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Ventura residents heading to Santa Barbara face
growing gridlock. But in Simi, more local jobs cut down on drive
times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every morning is a hurry-up-and-wait nightmare for Ventura County
commuter Diane Bissonnette.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, the Santa Barbara restaurateur bought a house in
Ventura because it was more affordable. It was only 30 miles from
work and her son's private school. What she didn't count on was the
traffic. Now, she and 8-year-old Lorenzo scramble into their van by
7:30 a.m. and race north up the Ventura Freeway, only to screech to a
halt as gridlock greets them at the county line. It's an hour each
way on a good day.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Huether of Simi Valley doesn't miss those days. Eight years
ago, he commuted an hour east to Pasadena for his job at mortgage
lender Countrywide. Over the last decade, his company has moved 4,900
jobs to Simi Valley, including Huether's. His drive now is less than
five minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Census figures released this week show two disparate trends among
Ventura County's 331,000 commuters. While the average drive is less
than half an hour each way, it has become a few minutes worse for
west county residents as the Santa Barbara workforce has gravitated
south toward more affordable housing. At the same time, commutes are
improving for residents on the county's east side, as more jobs are
created locally.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley respondents said their commute was 29 minutes on
average, three minutes shorter than in 1990. Thousand Oaks commuters
said their drive each way was about 26 minutes, 42 seconds less than
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of east county commuters still drive to work in the San
Fernando Valley or downtown Los Angeles. No one disputes that the
path is increasingly clogged. Huether said his wife's commute to
Burbank each day is 10 minutes longer than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say the overall decrease suggests that proportionally
fewer east county residents are making the long haul into Los
Angeles. "There are people who live around the corner from where
they're working and that's going to offset [census statistics] for
someone who's driving an hour," said Bill Watkins, executive director
of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project.</TE>
<TE>   As eastern Ventura County has attracted dozens of sizable
employers that offer good pay and career opportunities, Huether and
others are finding they have options closer to home, said Gary
Wartik, manager of economic development for Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 survey found 57% of working Thousand Oaks residents had
jobs in town, up from 40% a decade before. The county's largest
private employer is Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant Amgen,
which continues to grow. Countrywide in Simi Valley is the second
largest private employer. The challenge east county cities face,
Wartik said, is to make available more affordable housing. Otherwise,
they may find they are importing too much of their workforce,
particularly in the service and retail industries, creating a whole
new set of traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   In western Ventura County, economists and transportation officials
say other forces are at work. Commute times have increased two
minutes on average in Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Population growth has exceeded capacity, creating a bottleneck at
the Santa Clara River bridge between Oxnard and Ventura. Bridge
expansion over the next few years could ease that problem.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, homeowners in the Santa Clara Valley are finding it
takes longer to get to jobs in Los Angeles County. That is mainly
because of increased development across the county line around Santa
Clarita, halfway or more into their drive.</TE>
<TE>   Drive times went from 23 to 25 minutes in Santa Paula, from 25 to
31 minutes in Fillmore and from 26 to 36 minutes in rural Piru.</TE>
<TE>   But the newest and perhaps most intractable trend is western
Ventura County's growing popularity as a bedroom community for Santa
Barbara's workforce.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, as median home prices in Santa Barbara
have shot above $500,000, even some upper middle-class families have
found themselves priced out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, people like Bissonnette are flocking to Ventura, north
Oxnard and sometimes to Camarillo to buy homes in the $300,000 to
$400,000 range, then cramming onto a highway that narrows to two
lanes in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, the UCSB economist, has been making the drive from east
Ventura to Santa Barbara for several years. "Two years ago, if I left
at 7 a.m., everything was fine," Watkins said. "Now, it's 45 minutes
to the university, and if I hit traffic, an hour and fifteen
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials last summer launched a pilot program
offering $2 commuter bus service between Ventura and Santa Barbara.
Within months, they had met their three-year goal of 200 passengers a
day, said Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County
Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't made a dent in congestion. A recent survey found
8,900 Ventura County residents make the Santa Barbara commute. Still,
Gherardi said, "Even 200 less cars on the road is a step in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   The new census data show a 68% increase in public transportation
and taxi service. Even so, only about 1% of commuters reported using
such transportation as an alternative to cars. Walking is less
popular than a decade ago. And three-fourths of countywide commuters
make their drive alone.</TE>
<TE>   For Huether, that drive is "a world of difference" from his
commute to Pasadena. "I've gained back 10 hours a week of my life,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Bissonnette, it's a test of her will--and her son's. She
admits forcing 1960s tunes on the boy, including lots of Joan Baez.
Last week, though, she spilled soup all over the dashboard and fried
the stereo when she slammed on the van's brakes.</TE>
<TE>   The ocean view from Highway 101 is spectacular, but Bissonnette
said she doesn't enjoy it much because she's so focused on the
stop-and-go traffic. "I've managed to avoid being in traffic all my
life, until now," she said. "I don't think I can take it another
year. It's hard on the soul."</TE>

<HD>Convict Held in Stabbing Death of San Diego Girl, 12</HD>
<DH>Crime: Evidence from '98 killing includes blood on shirt.
Lawyer cites man's mental illness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A 33-year-old mentally unstable drug user and petty criminal was
arrested Wednesday for allegedly killing a 12-year-old girl in her
bed in suburban Escondido in January 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The slaying of Stephanie Ann Crowe has invited comparisons with
the mystery surrounding the death of JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder,
Colo. In both cases, a young girl was killed at night in her home, a
member of the family came under suspicion and the family insisted the
killer was an intruder even though police could find no evidence of
forced entry.</LD>
<LD>   In the weeks after the Crowe killing, the district attorney's
office charged Stephanie's brother and two of his friends in the
stabbing death.</LD>
<TE>   But charges were dropped on the eve of trial when three specks of
Stephanie's blood were found on the filthy sweatshirt of Richard
Tuite, a transient who was prowling the rural neighborhood knocking
on doors the night Stephanie was killed. An earlier forensic test had
failed to detect the blood and police thought Tuite too clumsy and
confused to have entered the home without leaving any evidence
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Amid civil lawsuits by the three teenagers' parents accusing
prosecutors and Escondido and Oceanside police officers of violating
the teens' rights, the murder investigation was transferred in late
1999 to the state attorney general's office and the San Diego County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   After a 30-month investigation, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and San
Diego County Sheriff Bill Kolender announced Wednesday that Tuite had
been arrested in the slaying. Tuite was set to be released from state
prison Friday after serving a sentence for an unrelated burglary
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer and Kolender conceded that winning a conviction will be
difficult. "There is still a lot of work to do," Kolender said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer and the prosecutor assigned to the case, Special Assistant
Atty. Gen. David Druliner, declined to say whether the investigation
had uncovered any evidence against Tuite beyond the three specks of
blood--specks that Tuite's attorney has long asserted were the result
of sloppy handling of evidence by police.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution, Lockyer and Druliner said, will face the daunting
task of explaining to jurors why the evidence that led a county grand
jury to indict the three teenagers was flawed.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence that led to indictments of Michael Crowe, Joshua
Treadway and Aaron Houser included incriminating statements by Houser
and Crowe, a confession by Treadway, testimony from a forensics
expert that a knife owned by Houser and found under Treadway's bed
was "consistent" with the nine wounds on Stephanie's body and
assertions by police that there was no evidence that anyone had
broken into the home.</TE>
<TE>   All three teens have claimed that police coerced them into making
false statements. And an expert witness for the defense was prepared
to assert that Houser's knife could not have been the murder weapon.</TE>
<TE>   If Tuite stands trial, prosecutors and police from the initial
case could be called, in effect, as defense witnesses to reject
allegations by the attorney general's office that their investigation
was botched.</TE>
<TE>   Asked specifically about Treadway's confession, Lockyer said,
"Yes, that's a complicating factor. The state will have to put on
evidence of the original theory [by the district attorney] and show
why that was faulty."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego attorney Edward Peckham, who has represented Tuite,
immediately accused the Sheriff's Department and attorney general's
office of trying to pin the case on a mentally ill convict who has
little support in the community.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized deputies and investigators for interrogating
Tuite for several hours this week without an attorney present. Months
ago, Peckham said, he asked prison officials to keep police from
interrogating Tuite, asserting that as a diagnosed
paranoid-schizophrenic Tuite is mentally incompetent to waive his
right to have a lawyer present during questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Druliner, on the other hand, said that Tuite did not appear
mentally ill during the interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Tuite has repeatedly denied killing Stephanie or attempting to
break into the Crowe home.</TE>
<TE>   He has served time in prison for burglary, auto theft and drug
use.</TE>
<TE>   In an affidavit in support of the arrest, Sheriff's Deputy Victor
Caloca noted that Tuite, in 1993 and 1996, was alleged to have
carried a knife. Caloca also concluded that statements by the
teenagers were false and were made under emotional duress.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm delighted we were able to bring some peace" to the Crowe
family, which has long accused Tuite of the crime, Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Peckham said Lockyer's office will find that the evidence amassed
against the three teenagers, at the very least, provides reasonable
doubt about Tuite's guilt. "This will be hotly litigated," he said.</TE>

<HD>Chief to Investigate Charges of Officers Belittling Reform</HD>
<DH>Decree: He says he wants to find those who allegedly made
negative statements about the federal order. Mayor also expresses
anger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department's new interim chief launched an
investigation Wednesday into allegations that officers have publicly
undermined support for federally mandated police reforms, while Mayor
James K. Hahn said he was "angry" that police officials have failed
to implement some provisions of the decree that spells out those
requirements.</LD>
<LD>   The independent monitor overseeing the implementation of the
consent decree concluded that the LAPD has fallen behind schedule in
implementing a number of measures, including tracking racial data on
pedestrian and traffic stops, says a report filed in U.S. District
Court on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Monitor Michael Cherkasky, with Kroll Associates, also cited
several instances in which officers working on a special task force
to implement the decree publicly denigrated the court-mandated
reforms. Cherkasky said those remarks betrayed official ambivalence
about the decree and served to erode public backing for it.</LD>
<TE>   Although Cherkasky said in his report that he heard some remarks
himself, he did not name the officers responsible for them. Martin
Pomeroy, interim chief of the Police Department, said Wednesday that
the department will try to find out who they were.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one place where we have let ourselves and the
community down, that would be in those instances where the monitor
said that some of our people have not had the best attitude about
complying with the consent decree," he said. "We launched an
immediate investigation. We will find out who made those statements
and have an appropriate reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also called on the department to act.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very angry when I read the monitor's findings," Hahn said.
"The attitude needs to change in the LAPD from one of hostility to
one of really finishing the job."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, officers assigned to the LAPD's Consent
Decree Task Force, the group responsible for seeing that the
department implements the provisions of the decree, complained during
public meetings that the reforms were "unnecessary and
time-consuming." The officers also alleged that the reforms were
being imposed on the department by "outsiders."</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky also faulted the LAPD for its handling of confidential
informants and its efforts to track and thwart street gangs, among
other things.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor's report was filed Wednesday with U.S. District Judge
Gary Feess, who has the authority to punish the city for failing to
comply with the decree. Feess is expected to hold a hearing on the
matter in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials entered into the decree last year to head
off a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, which accused the
LAPD of "a pattern or practice" of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, Hahn said he would oppose Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid
for a second term because he questioned whether the chief was doing
enough to implement the reforms outlined in the decree.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing similar worries, the Police Commission voted 4 to 1
last month to deny Parks a second five-year term. Parks stepped down
two weeks ago.</TE>

<DH>Law: Irvine attorney has won notice with large settlements
in the sex abuse scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine lawyer Katherine K. Freberg is a newcomer to the small club of
attorneys who represent victims of sexual abuse by priests. But the
two cases she helped settle--and the resulting publicity--have pushed
her near the head of the club.</LD>
<LD>   One suit resulted in a $5.2-million payout in August and a series
of changes to the sexual-abuse policies of the Los Angeles and Orange
dioceses. The other ended last month in a $1.2-million settlement for
a woman who alleged her priest impregnated her and paid for the
abortion.</LD>
<LD>   This month, Freberg filed a suit in Orange County Superior Court
alleging the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Diocese of Orange conspired
to transfer a priest--a convicted child molester--across the country
to Southern California, where he continued to sexually abuse minors.
Correspondence between the two dioceses show they knew the priest had
"a moral problem" with boys.</LD>
<TE>   Freberg's critics--some opposing attorneys and some within the
Roman Catholic church--are reluctant to criticize her publicly,
saying they have to do business with her and she can be vindictive.
Privately, they complain that she has a self-serving agenda that
revolves around money and attention.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg shrugs off the criticism--with one exception.</TE>
<TE>   This month, she arranged for an alleged victim to tell the news
media that police had him use a recording device to obtain a
confession from a priest he said molested him.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Griswold said he made his story public because he was
frustrated by state statute-of-limitation laws and the possibility
that his complaint against Father David Granadino, an Azusa priest,
would not be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials, who encouraged the secret taping to
produce contemporary evidence that would overcome
statute-of-limitations issues, were angry at Freberg and Griswold,
saying Griswold's revelation could compromise use of the technique in
other investigations. Griswold later pleaded with a reporter to stop
the story from being published.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg said, "I didn't look at the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Corpus Christi, Texas, Freberg, 41, stands 6-feet-1--two
inches taller in her usual heels--and revels in her height. It got
her a basketball scholarship at Texas Tech, where she averaged 14
points per game as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   Her law school dean at Pepperdine University, Ronald F. Phillips,
still marvels at the athletic skills Freberg showed during a semester
abroad in London, when the Waves took on Notre Dame law school in an
annual co-ed touch football game in Hyde Park.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg's height also translates into courtroom confidence. "I
don't like being the center of attention," she said, "but I like to
be able to see everyone in a room."</TE>
<TE>   Practicing Law Is 'About Working Long Hours'</TE>
<TE>   Her father, a major in the Army, died when she was 19. Freberg
watched her mother raise seven children and put six of them through
college.</TE>
<TE>   The law, she said, "has little to do with brains. It's about
working long hours."</TE>
<TE>   Freberg said she works seven days a week, juggling her corporate
clients with the avalanche of new business generated by the church's
sex scandal. In recent months, she said, she's talked with more than
125 people who say they were molested by priests and has signed up 15
clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I spend my nights calling them back and crying with them on the
phone," she said. She tears up often in interviews and at news
conferences, then explains she is moved by the pain of those betrayed
by figures they trusted as children.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of the cases she undertakes are usually
daunting: Most have statute-of-limitations problems, nearly all the
clients have suffered emotional damage, the abuse was largely in
private, and the church has some of the best attorneys in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   A casual referral from another lawyer five years ago pushed her
into the field--and resulted in the $5.2-million settlement that is
the largest for a single victim of abuse by a priest. The client,
Ryan DiMaria, told Freberg and her then-partner, John Manly, that he
had been molested by a popular Orange County monsignor.</TE>
<TE>   Manly, a Catholic, already had an understanding of the church, but
had never sued the institution. Freberg, raised an Episcopalian, had
a steeper learning curve. She began by reading books, articles and
official church literature and directories.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg and Manly called on attorneys and others with experience
in church litigation, who gave free advice--something Freberg said
she now gives, along with copies of legal documents, to attorneys who
call her office.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled the moment that defined the harshness of the
forthcoming legal battle. It came during the deposition of DiMaria,
who accused Msgr. Michael Harris, his former high school principal,
of molesting him in the early 1990s. Harris' attorney asked DiMaria
about the first alleged molestation:</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, when it happened, you did not enjoy it, did you?"</TE>
<TE>   Wiping away tears, Freberg said: "It told me at that point they
would be willing to go to extremes."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who left the priesthood, has denied the accusations and
was never criminally charged.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg takes pains to say the 50 or so depositions she and her
partner took of Catholic priests revealed to her caring clerics who
take their faith seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "These are truly good men who are dismayed at what their brother
priests have done and how their bosses have covered it up," she said.
"My problem is with the hierarchy."</TE>
<TE>   She also didn't anticipate the emotional toll the cases would take
on her. She said she's developed "a nasty habit of waking up at 2
a.m. and calling my message machine at work to dictate some details
that need to be followed up."</TE>
<TE>   Fans and critics of Freberg agree that she's a bright, resourceful
attorney who's a fierce advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a strength there without undue aggression," said Richard
Sipe, a former priest who consults with plaintiffs' attorneys about
the inner workings of the Catholic Church and worked on the DiMaria
case. "Some people beat you into submission by their bombastic
presence. But she challenges you intellectually without beating you
up."</TE>
<TE>   'She Tends to Believe Everything They Say'</TE>
<TE>   Peter M. Callahan, a Tustin attorney who represents the Diocese of
Orange, said: "She's always very well-prepared and she fights very
hard for her clients, although she tends to believe everything they
say at face value. And the truth is these cases on both sides often
come in various shades of gray."</TE>
<TE>   Freberg won't discuss her financial stake in the cases. (Lawyers'
contingency fees normally are about 30%.) "The only way to get the
attention of the church is to hit them in the pocketbook," she said.
"I'd prefer criminal convictions, but that hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   She points out that DiMaria settled his lawsuit for $5.2 million,
much less than the $19 million he initially demanded, because the
church agreed to adopt a number of policies in the Los Angeles and
Orange dioceses that require an independent advocate for victims, an
anonymous toll-free number to report alleged molestations, and
information about sexual-abuse prevention distributed to parishes and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg married her longtime boyfriend in 1999. The couple live in
Lake Forest, and she said her new black Mercedes-Benz and antique
office furniture have been her only extravagant purchases since
receiving her portion of the $6.4 million in settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what she does for fun, Freberg thought it over awhile. Then
she gave up.</TE>
<TE>   "Work, I guess," she said. "I love work."</TE>
<TE>   But later, her husband, Jon Gates, phoned a reporter to make sure
his wife wasn't labeled boring.</TE>
<TE>   "Did she tell you about shooting skeet, going to plays, throwing
dinner parties, closing down half the Horseshoe Casino for our
wedding reception?" he asked. "We're going 24/7."</TE>
<TE>   Told this, Freberg laughed, embarrassed that her compulsiveness
had blotted out any memory of fun: "Maybe I'm not so boring."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Dies After Crash Ends Chase</HD>
<DH>Pursuit: The man was wanted in connection with South L.A.
slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 24-year-old murder suspect fleeing police died Wednesday after the
car he was driving plowed into the back of a flatbed truck in South
Los Angeles, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The afternoon chase started after Mitchell Gibson and two other
men left a funeral in Inglewood, Los Angeles Police Lt. Marty
Cotwright said.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the men exited the car after they realized police were
following them. As Gibson got out to take the wheel of the vehicle,
officers fired rubber pellets at him, but that failed to stop him,
police said.</LD>
<TE>   Gibson then led gang officers, who had been doing surveillance on
him, on a three-minute chase, said Officer Jason Lee. The vehicle, a
Chrysler PT Cruiser, crashed into the rear of a flat-bed truck at
92nd and Main streets, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   "The front of the car was basically torn off. [Gibson] suffered
massive injuries from the crash," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson died later at King-Drew Medical Center. No one else was
injured. The two men riding with Gibson before the chase began were
detained but probably will not be arrested, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Gibson was one of three men involved in an Oct. 7,
2000, shooting in the 1400 block of East 48th Street that left one
man dead. The other two men have been convicted, Lee said. Other
details of the slaying were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI had helped LAPD track down Gibson, Lee said.</TE>

<HD>Critics Decry Medical Cuts</HD>
<DH>Budget: Governor's plan would affect children's health
care, they say. Officials say Davis did best to protect programs
despite deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outlining his budget priorities this week, Gov. Gray Davis promised
to protect health care for poor children even as he tried to overcome
a $23.6-billion deficit.</LD>
<LD>   But both directly and indirectly, the governor's spending plan
would hurt children's medical care, advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   These critics say Davis' proposals to cut outreach funds would
mean families remain unaware of their eligibility for public health
insurance programs. Decreasing Medi-Cal payments to physicians would
mean fewer doctors participating in the program. And, they say,
experience has shown that scaling back parents' eligibility for
coverage would mean that fewer eligible children would be signed up
as well.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't put kids' health on hold for a year while we figure out
how to better balance our budget," said Amy Dominguez-Arms, vice
president of Children Now, an advocacy group in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's top priority was to shield public education from
the knife, but children's advocates said a child's ability to learn
depends on more than classroom and teacher spending.</TE>
<TE>   "Cuts that affect families' access to health affect children's
readiness for school," Dominguez-Arms said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials argued that the governor did his best to protect
children's health programs. His budget does not cut any children out
of the government-subsidized Medi-Cal or Healthy Families programs,
nor does it impose additional paperwork requirements on families to
keep children enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, officials estimated, enrollment in the Healthy Families
program for children of the working poor is expected to jump from
559,000 this year to 624,000 next year. Healthy Families covers
children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal but not
enough to afford private health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's commitment to kids remains, and it's unparalleled,
not only in health insurance but across the board," said Glen
Rosselli, undersecretary for Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the proposed budget cuts would stall outreach efforts.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Davis has postponed for three years an initiative
that would have allowed schools to automatically enroll children in
Medi-Cal if they are eligible for the free and reduced lunch program.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has proposed eliminating $18.6 million for other
outreach campaigns by schools and nonprofit groups. That comes just
four months after Davis stopped payment on $20.7 million for media
campaigns to enroll kids.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just dismantling this infrastructure that we've been trying
to build in this state for the past 2 1/2 years," said Lark
Galloway-Gilliam, executive director of Community Health Councils of
Los Angeles. "What is wrong with this man?"</TE>
<TE>   Children may also be hurt by the governor's proposal to reduce
reimbursements to physicians and other health-care providers,
health-care advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   For example, payments to California Children's Services would drop
by 49%. That agency helps offset the costs of treatment for patients
under age 21 with complex conditions that are either life-threatening
or debilitating.</TE>
<TE>   "Their care literally depends on these programs," said Dr. Stuart
E. Siegel, a member of the Children's Specialty Care Coalition, a
patient advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest impacts of the budget cuts on children's
health, however, would be indirect. Research has shown that when
adults have insurance, their children are more likely to have
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "Children follow their parents to the doctor's office," said
Yolanda Vera, senior health policy attorney at Neighborhood Legal
Services in Los Angeles. If parents have to pay more for private
insurance, "it'll have a back-door effect on kids."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the governor proposed increasing the income
requirements for two-parent families to enroll in Medi-Cal. Families
would not be allowed to enroll unless they earn less than 67% of the
federal poverty level. All families earning less than the poverty
level are now eligible.</TE>
<TE>   The budget also would reinstate procedures in which adults need to
fill out forms every quarter, instead of annually, to remain enrolled
in Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start imposing more requirements for going down and
reenrolling, you will create greater confusion in the health-care
system," said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. "The more confused people
become, the less likely they are to sign up themselves or their
kids."</TE>
<TE>   All told, the state expects the cuts to lower Medi-Cal rolls by
490,600, or 7.5%, below the governor's previous predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, the health cuts could put the governor in a difficult
position. Davis has acknowledged the link between the insurance
status of adults and children's access to care.</TE>
<TE>   He first proposed expanding the Healthy Families program to cover
300,000 working parents in 2000, suggesting that children would be
enrolled when parents were enrolled. He later delayed the expansion
for fiscal reasons, then supported it, and now has delayed it again.</TE>
<TE>   Though his critics accuse Davis of a lack of commitment to
children and the poor, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said
Davis was savvy in his budget choices.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's given up on health care, per se, but I do
think he has targeted programs where he perceives that there is less
political risk in cutting," said Jeffe, a senior scholar in the
School of Policy, Planning and Development at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the people who don't tend to vote as opposed to types of
health-care programs that might impact more middle-class voters."</TE>

<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's new grand jury was selected Wednesday in a random
drawing at the Central Justice Center in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The 19 jurors and 11 alternates will begin their one-year terms
July 1 after a seven-day training program, said Carole Levitzky, a
spokeswoman for the Orange County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   "We are happy with the diverse representation," Levitzky said of
the group, composed of three African Americans, two Asians, two
Latinos and 12 whites.</LD>
<TE>   The mix of genders--11 men and 8 women--is also well balanced,
Levitzky said. And the age range, from 45 to 72 with an average of
62, is slightly younger than previous grand juries.</TE>
<TE>   The field of 242 applicants was narrowed to 30 through a series of
security checks and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, county officials randomly selected the final members
of the body that meets regularly, Levitzky said, to examine "county
operations and quality-of-life issues" ranging from sewage spills and
beach closures to swimming pool safety and the need for fire
sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   The members of the Orange County Grand Jury for 2002-03 are Anne
Brown of Fullerton; Lawrence Callahan of Garden Grove; Tao-Han Chang
of Yorba Linda; Patricia Coakley of Villa Park; Christina Deaton of
Balboa Island; Jeffrey Hamilton of Santa Ana; Ronald Harris of
Mission Viejo; Margaret James-Edwards of Garden Grove; Jerry Krans of
San Clemente; Deepak Mehta of Orange; William Nelson of Villa Park;
Carlos Olvera of Dana Point; Marcia Rubin of Irvine; Viola Sadler of
Anaheim; Gerald Schamahorn of Huntington Beach; Louis Schulte of

<HD>Harbor Secession Not Dead Yet</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Despite objections from Hahn, state panel agrees
to look at new figures that show the breakaway area could survive
financially.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as Mayor James K. Hahn made an impassioned argument against
breaking up Los Angeles, the commission studying secession said
Wednesday it might revive a plan to split the harbor area off from
the city, a proposal considered all but dead last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission agreed to examine new
financial figures that secessionists contend will show a harbor city
would be fiscally sound. On Saturday, LAFCO's executive officer had
said such a city would not be able to pay its bills.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's action Wednesday was a snub to Hahn, who told the
panel that the current secession plans for the harbor, San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood would result in "financial ruin" for the
proposed cities and the rest of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn invoked a state law that allows the commission to order a
secession election only if the proposed city would be financially
healthy--and its creation would not hurt the remainder of the old
city. LAFCO is to decide during the next few weeks whether to place
the harbor, Valley and Hollywood proposals on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has said that he favors a citywide vote on secession,
providing the plans pass financial muster. On Wednesday, he stopped
short of saying that Los Angeles would sue to prevent a secession
election. But he did say that if the commissioners approve the
proposals without revisions, it "would open them up to a suit."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also asked the commission to consider a new report by city
consultant Edward Hamilton that questions the financial analysis that
LAFCO is using in its review of the secession plans.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission ignored his request, and several members
discounted the concerns that had been raised.</TE>
<TE>   "You are being used right now," Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who sits on the commission, told Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than study the issue further, Yaroslavsky said, "Let the
people decide if we don't know what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Board member James DiGuiseppe agreed with Yaroslavsky and invoked
the American Revolution. "We had an incident once called the Boston
Tea Party," he said.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Officer Larry Calemine issued a report last month
that said the Valley would be in good financial shape if it withdrew
from Los Angeles. A similar report is due out soon for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Calemine said flatly that the harbor would not be
financially viable even "under the rosiest scenario."</TE>
<TE>   But he surprised the commissioners Wednesday by submitting a
report showing that the harbor could survive on its own--as long as
LAFCO forced Los Angeles to forgive a new city several million
dollars in debt on city bonds.</TE>
<TE>   That would make sense, Calemine said, because Los Angeles now
provides services to the harbor area at a deficit, meaning the region
is not producing enough tax revenue to contribute to the debt
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine's proposal infuriated representatives of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like asking an accountant 'What's two plus two?' and he
pulls down the window shade and asks, 'What do you want it to be?'"
said Ron Deaton, the city's chief legislative analyst.</TE>

<HD>Safety Panel Considers Rules on TV News Vans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that a Los Angeles television reporter's near-fatal accident
could have killed or injured dozens of other people as well, state
officials are poised to adopt the nation's first safety rules for TV
news vans.</LD>
<LD>   Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board regulations to be
considered today would require special safety devices to prevent TV
reporters from accidentally raising microwave antenna masts--which go
as high as 70 feet--into power lines.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the state's estimated 1,000 microwave television
trucks have the potential to kill hundreds if their antennas touch
overhead electric lines at a crowded news scene.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed regulations would require frequent inspection of news
vans to make certain that mast-raising safety levers and warning
alarms have not been disabled. Training of photographers, reporters
and TV news assignment supervisors would be required.</TE>
<TE>   The safety crackdown was sought by five Southern California
television labor unions following the May 22, 2000, accident in which
a KABC-TV Channel 7 news van mast was raised more than 40 feet into a
19,980-volt power line in Hollywood. Although not directly below the
lines, the van was parked on an uneven surface that caused the mast
to lean into them.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Adrienne Alpert, then 49, was severely burned when she
stepped out of the truck and touched the ground, sending the electric
current surging through her body. Third-degree burns forced the
amputation of her lower right leg, left forearm, part of her left
foot and several fingers on her right hand.</TE>
<TE>   KABC photographer Heather MacKenzie, 47, and a Los Angeles police
officer suffered less serious electrical shocks.</TE>
<TE>   Onlookers screamed at Alpert to run when the microwave dish rubbed
against one of the lines and began sparking. But her arm touched the
truck's door as her foot touched the parking pad, grounding her.
Investigators later credited a water faucet on the wall of a nearby
auto repair shop with saving Alpert's life. Most of the electric
line's high voltage arced from the truck's right front tire to the
faucet. The jolt blew out the copper pipe's soldered joints, flooding
the repair shop with water.</TE>
<TE>   "What if that had been a gas line and not a water line?" asks Mark
Bell, a former Boston TV technician who for eight years has crusaded
for improved news van safety.</TE>
<TE>   Crusader Catalogs Dozens of Incidents</TE>
<TE>   Bell has cataloged dozens of news van encounters with power lines
across the country, including five in which the microwave truck
operators were killed. The first occurred in 1985 in Bakersfield, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most news van accidents cause disfiguring or disabling injuries
but not death. The same month Alpert was injured, three news van crew
members were seriously injured by electric shocks in Alexandria, Va.,
and a news photographer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was badly burned in a
similar accident.</TE>
<TE>   The potential threat to the public can be even greater, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Under certain conditions, a TV truck mast that is touching a
high-voltage line can send electric current zapping hundreds of feet
across the ground, said Bell--who plans to attend today's 11 a.m.
session at the State Office Building at 1350 Front St. in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a public safety issue," Bell said. "Where do TV trucks
go? Where people are." Bystanders need not be standing on wet ground
or any other conductive surface to be shocked by high voltage, he
said. "If an accident like that happened at the start of a marathon,
people would drop like flies over hundreds of square feet."</TE>
<TE>   A similar warning was offered last year to Cal/OSHA officials
after broadcast union members petitioned the state for the new safety
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Gena Stinnett, a KABC-TV videotape editor and union local
president, told OSHA standards board members that hundreds could be
killed or injured at a major news scene if an electrical accident
occurred. "There could be a major tragedy. Rings of energy work in a
way that people in the vicinity can suffer from severe electrical
shock," Stinnett said.</TE>
<TE>   OSHA officials, who fined KABC-TV $29,950 for the Alpert accident,
say the rules being considered today could be in effect as early as
the first of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Requirements are expected to include use of a "constant pressure"
switch outside the truck that will require van operators to
physically press the lever that raises the mast and use of a level
that would show if the van is parked on a slope. Lights would have to
be installed to illuminate the mast during nighttime use, along with
visual and audible alarms that would warn if the antenna is still up
while the truck is moving.</TE>
<TE>   News vans also would have to carry warning signs and instructional
manuals. And truck operators, reporters and assignment editors alike
would have to be trained to understand that van safety supercedes the
competitive rush to be first in reporting the news, according to the
proposed rules. Trucks would be inspected quarterly to ensure that
safety devices had not been removed.</TE>
<TE>   Although mast manufacturers already install switches that must be
continuously pressed in order for pneumatic systems to raise
antennas, news van operators in the past have routinely disabled them
with bungee cords, duct tape or small sticks, insiders acknowledge.
That's because it takes about five minutes to fully extend some
antennas and photographers would rather spend that time setting up
their cameras, cables and tripods.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturer Says KABC Mast Was Altered</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer of the mast used on the KABC van has alleged that
its safety switch was intentionally bypassed. "Somebody took the
springs out. I saw it with my own eyes," said Steven Pinkley,
commercial products manager with Will-Burt Co. of Orrville, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   David Converse, an ABC television network vice president in charge
of engineering, said he is not certain whether the mast switch on
Alpert's van had been altered. But though he acknowledged that "most
everyone modified these devices" in the past, that is no longer the
case, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pinkley's company, along with the manufacturer of the van's
microwave transmitter, is being sued by Alpert; under workers'
compensation procedures, she cannot sue KABC.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Alpert is keeping quiet about the accident--at least
for now. Like MacKenzie, who now works as a videotape editor, Alpert
is back at work. She uses a prosthesis when on news assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't talk about it," she said. "I wouldn't want to shoot
myself in the foot--I only have one."</TE>

<LD>Howard's Appliances will pay $15,000 and stop recording customers'
personal information on credit card slips under an agreement that
Orange County prosecutors announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In response to a complaint, the Orange County district attorney's
office sent an undercover investigator to a Howard's outlet.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation found that workers were writing information such
as driver's license numbers, addresses or telephone numbers on credit
card slips. Putting such information on the slips puts consumers at
risk for identity theft and is illegal, authorities said.</LD>

<LD>Actress Tawny Kitaen and her husband, pitcher Chuck Finley of the
Cleveland Indians, accuse one another of domestic violence and drug
abuse in dueling court documents.</LD>
<LD>   Finley filed divorce papers and obtained a temporary restraining
order after his wife allegedly attacked him. The court order also
gave him temporary custody of the couple's daughters, ages 9 and 3.</LD>
<LD>   Petitioning to regain custody, Kitaen alleged that Finley started
a fight that led to her arrest in April. She also accused him of
alcohol and drug abuse, and said he took steroids.</LD>
<TE>   The petitions were filed May 2 in Orange County Superior Court. A
hearing on Kitaen's request has been continued until June 3.</TE>

<LD>When it comes to buying clothes, collectors seeking celebrity duds
have different standards from the rest of us. Lelands auction house
of New York lovingly describes a 1981 jersey of ex-Dodger pitcher
Fernando Valenzuela this way: "The white borders of the 'Dodgers' on
the chest and the 'Valenzuela 34' on the back are yellow with sweat,
and the collar area is downright disgusting."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of disgusting: Other items on the block include an outfit
that's "complete with alien slime" and was worn by Ron Silver in the
sci-fi potboiler "The Arrival." There's also a souvenir menu
autographed by Elvis, which Lelands proudly notes is adorned with "a
stain inside that looks like the au jus from the $15 prime rib."</LD>
<LD>   And, finally, you won't want to pass up the "California Carrots
Howdy Doody Cigarette Lighter," described as an advertising ploy by a
produce company.</LD>
<TE>   "Since Howdy never smoked, and never would," Lelands said, "you
will not see one of these again."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like: James Terrill of Fullerton saw an ad for a waterbed
that is topped by a giant appetizer, while Jane Bush of Palm Desert
spotted a pair of shoes with an unusual finish (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Kim Savage Feibleman noticed the wild fluctuations in
a price of woven shorts on the Internet, from almost $10,000 to--get
this!--the store pays you almost $10,000 (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena: Surf City north? The doctored sign showing a pedestrian
holding a surfboard in Pasadena struck a chord with a friend who
recalled the 1965 song "New York's a Lonely Town" by the Trade Winds.</TE>
<TE>   This sad tale of a surfer who moves from Southern California to
the Big Apple contained the immortal lyric, "Central Park to
Pasadena's such a long way," thereby giving the impression that waves
were lapping up on Colorado Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   A license to make money? In observance of the 65th anniversary of

<HD>Beach Pollution Source Still Elusive</HD>
<DH>Study: Orange County sanitation officials can't blame
sewage outfall pipes for bacteria that closed beaches. A UCI
scientist says his theory may still be valid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON, JANET WILSON and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending $5 million on an elaborate study, the Orange County
Sanitation District said Wednesday it is no closer to pinpointing
what caused the summer-long closure of the Huntington Beach coastline
in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by consultants hired by the district, found
no substantial evidence that an offshore sewage plume caused the
beach pollution. But for the first time the district said it could
not rule the plume out as one of the possible causes.</LD>
<LD>   The study measured thousands of water samples to test a UC Irvine
professor's theory that bacteria-laced waste water pumped four miles
out to sea was finding its way back to shore.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not yet found a connection between coastal ocean
processes and bacterial contamination on the beaches," said Marlene
Noble, one of the scientists who conducted the study.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Murphy, a spokeswoman for the district, added: "They are not
ruling it out ... [but] the scientists cannot link the treated waste
water to the shoreline contamination."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it's possible that the beach closure could have
been caused by several factors coming together at one time, including
polluted runoff, leaking restroom sewers that have since been fixed,
old sewers at a mobile home park and waste from seagulls.</TE>
<TE>   "The contamination problem ... is complex and made up of multiple
sources that contribute to the problem," said Kelly Christensen,
principal environmental specialist for the district.</TE>
<TE>   For environmentalists, the agency's disclosure left many questions
unanswered. A written report won't be ready until October, and the
data collected by scientists weren't immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for good science, and once this has been
read and digested, we'll see how good the science is," said
Christopher Evans, U.S. executive director of Surfrider Foundation,
which has monitored the Huntington Beach closures. "The thing that
looms over this is that it's an Orange County Sanitation District
study. Everyone sees the potential conflict there."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Grant, the UC Irvine scientist who first suggested a link
between the sewage discharge and the beach pollution, said Wednesday
he didn't doubt the district's findings. But he said its carefully
worded conclusion leaves open the possibility that his hypothesis is
still valid.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying they cannot put the plume in the surf zone but
can't rule it out," Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by researchers from the University of
Southern California, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School under guidance by the U.S. Geological
Survey and sanitation district scientists. Scientists from UC Santa
Barbara's Marine Science Institute and the University of Hawaii
reviewed the results and presented their findings at a meeting of the
district's board of directors Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The results leave the mystery as to what caused the high bacteria
counts that forced health officials to close miles of Huntington
Beach in 1999 during the height of tourist season. Every summer
since, bacteria counts have spiked. A portion of the beach was closed
again for a month this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the million-dollar question that I don't think anybody in
this county knows the answer to," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials hope their study will allow the
agency to keep a waiver to the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver, which is up for renewal next year, allows the agency
to treat half of the waste water it pumps into the ocean at levels
less than those adopted by most of the nation's 16,000 sanitation
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups and three coastal cities, including
Huntington Beach, oppose extending the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials say treating all of its outflow to
the highest levels--by using microorganisms to eliminate bacteria and
viruses--would cost more than $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also at stake is Huntington Beach's economic lifeblood. The city's
8.5 miles of beach attracts 10 million people a year. The recent
closures due to pollution have sullied Surf City's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   After 1999's beach shutdown, authorities looked at and discarded
possible causes for the high bacteria levels, including urban runoff
from Talbert Marsh and the Santa Ana River.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, UC Irvine's Grant suggested the sanitation
district's offshore plume was partially to blame.</TE>
<TE>   He theorized that partially treated sewage from showers, sinks and
toilets was being drawn back to the beach by tides, underwater waves
and the local AES power plant's ocean-fed cooling system.</TE>
<TE>   "A really important question is whether this study tests the exact
hypothesis," Surfrider's Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "How exacting was the testing of this hypothesis? And how will the
results be spun out by a bunch of flack catchers for the guys who
want to keep doing the polluting?"</TE>
<TE>   Grant and other scientists agreed that finding the cause of the
pollution has proved vexing. Researchers have gone down several paths
but have yet to come up with a definitive cause.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said the agency's study involved 150 researchers and
volunteers and was "the single largest sampling event to occur in
this area."</TE>

<CX>   Treated sewage--A story in Thursday's California section incorrectly
said the Orange County Sanitation District has sought an extension of
a waiver that allows the agency to send partially treated sewage
through an ocean outfall. District officials have said a new
$400-million plant could be needed if the waiver isn't renewed, but
the district has not yet decided whether to seek one.</CX>

<HD>New Telephone System Urged for Child-Abuse Calls</HD>
<DH>Government: The grand jury report recommends upgrades to
cut waiting and improve service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's primary 24-hour child-abuse hotline is an outdated
phone system in need of upgrades that include voicemail and automated
menu options for quicker response times, according to a report
released Wednesday by the Orange County Grand Jury.</LD>
<LD>   A nine-month study conducted last year found that 15% of callers
typically hang up after waiting more than two minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "We consider that high," said Bill Cook, a grand jury member and
chairman of its juvenile services committee. "People weren't getting
through to social workers in a timely manner."</LD>
<TE>   The goal, Cook said, is to reduce the number of aborted calls and
cut the waiting time to a minute or less.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current phone system, implemented in 1994 after a
previous grand jury review, callers can neither leave voice messages
nor select automated menu options to route their calls. Social
workers also cannot filter urgent child-abuse reports from non-abuse
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, the system was considered state-of-the-art," said
Michael Riley, director of Children and Family Services for the
county. "So we already were considering upgrading our system. We hope
to have a better system in place in a year, depending on the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Social Services Agency, the county's Child Abuse
Registry operates with 32 senior social workers who cover the phones
around the clock, with as many as 16 staffers receiving calls during
peak hours from 4:30 to 11 p.m. and providing emergency responses as
needed.</TE>
<TE>   One tenacious caller waited on the line for 47 minutes before
getting an answer, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The registry receives as many as 5,000 calls a month, half of
which are abuse allegations and half requests for information and
referral services, Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury's recommendations include a system that would allow
callers to select the language of choice and an automated voicemail
system with options that could help route non-abuse calls, reducing
demands on social workers. All calls now are answered in
chronological order.</TE>
<TE>   Mandated callers, who include professionals such as teachers,
physicians and nurses, are required by law to report child-abuse
cases by phone or fax.</TE>
<TE>   There is no time limit on how long a social worker should spend
with a caller.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of the senior social worker is not to screen calls,
but to get as much information from the caller as possible to
determine if it's a valid child-abuse allegation," Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has 60 days to respond to the grand jury's findings and
recommendations. The report also will be reviewed by the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Renovate Apartments Denied</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Owner sought bond funding, but proposal to help
poor is deemed inadequate by City Council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unconvinced that the plan would benefit the city's poorest workers,
the Oxnard City Council has rejected a developer's bid to use nearly
$10 million in bonds to renovate a run-down apartment complex and
turn it into affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   The decision Tuesday evening, which came after months of
discussions and consideration, left no one happy. Orange County-based
RHC Communities had requested that the city issue the bond money to
renovate the 157-unit Mira Loma Apartments on West 5th Street near
downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The developer's proposal would have decreased rents by using bond
tax credits and would have subsidized rents for the next 55 years,
said David Rose, chief operating officer with RHC Communities, whose
parent company purchased the apartments a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Mira Loma is home to mostly low-income immigrants who work at area
farms and in construction. The complex now faces an uncertain future,
said the developer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shellshocked the city made its decision to not make it
affordable housing," Rose said. Although the rents would have been
too high for some of the city's poorest residents, "it would have
been a lot better than what we're faced with now."</TE>
<TE>   The apartments will continue to be rented at the market rate, Rose
said, although his company may consider investing $2 million to $3
million to turn them into upscale housing. The company is also
considering selling the complex, and says it has a potential buyer.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the rents will be increased as necessary to cover
operating and repair costs, Rose said. Built in the 1940s, the
apartments require constant repair.</TE>
<TE>   Monthly rent at the complex ranges from $825 for a one-bedroom
unit to $1,050 for a two-bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Mira Loma residents said any more rent hikes would be unbearable
because of the low wages they earn. About 50 residents and their
supporters appeared before the council with signs that read "I pick
the food you eat. Where should I live?" and "Low Wages Can't Pay High
Rent."</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Gabriel Alvarado was forced to leave Mira Loma because it
became unaffordable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are people with very low income. We are humble," Alvarado, one
in a stream of residents asking for housing assistance, said in
Spanish. "I would like to have help."</TE>
<TE>   Even with potential rent decreases ranging from $32 to $267 after
renovation, many low-income workers still would not have been able to
afford to stay at Mira Loma, argued Eileen McCarthy, staff attorney
for California Rural Legal Assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no net public benefit" from the developer's proposal,
McCarthy said, because the "affordable" rents proposed did not take
into account that the income of current Mira Loma residents is well
below 50% of the median county income--the amount that defines a
family as "very low income."</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County median income is $74,000, while a full-time
minimum wage worker can expect to earn no more than $13,500 a year,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   That places many Mira Loma families at less than 20% of the
median, not just in the "very low income" category but "extremely low
income," McCarthy said. RHC's plan did not fill the needs of those
families, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting the bond request, the City Council questioned whether
the developer's plan met the needs of poor residents. Councilman Dean
Maulhardt also asked why the developer no longer included three- and
four-bedroom units in its plans.</TE>
<TE>   Rose said the original plan was not cost-effective and was scaled
back to include just renovations on existing units.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former Mira Loma residents said the apartments are in
terrible shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't miss the roaches and the mice," said Denise Caballero,
34, who was recently evicted from her apartment for nonpayment of
rent. "The fence is broken, there are rusted nails everywhere. It's
not safe."</TE>
<TE>   Since the developer acquired the complex in April 2001, the
apartments have improved, said Barton Stern, president of Ventura
Investment Co., which operates Mira Loma apartments. Some $200,000
has been spent on repairs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is a work in progress," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Adriana Hernandez lives in a two-bedroom apartment with her
husband, daughter and another small family. They pay $997 a month but
have few expectations, she said. Hernandez finally gave up on getting
her bathroom sink repaired and taped the faucet to keep the children
from running water.</TE>
<TE>   In the kitchen, cabinet doors lie next to the pantry, useless
after hinges fell off. Outside, the brick fence is in disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad. And the rent is too high," Hernandez said. "But we've
looked. Everywhere is the same. There is nowhere to go."</TE>

<HD>240 Workers Stage One-Day Strike at Hospital in Lynwood</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union members accuse St. Francis Medical Center of
delaying contract talks. The facility denies the charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 240 technicians and licensed vocational nurses went on strike
for one day Wednesday at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood,
contending that the hospital, which changed hands this year, has
stalled negotiations for a union contract.</LD>
<LD>   But registered nurses, doctors and other workers among the 1,700
hospital staff members stayed on the job.</LD>
<LD>   A hospital spokeswoman said there was "no disruption of service."
The strikers are expected to return to work today.</LD>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Carol Lee Thorpe said Wednesday was an inopportune
time for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   State health-care cuts proposed this week by the Davis
administration would cost the hospital, which serves many Medicare
and poor patients, at least $2.4 million in the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen workers picketed the facility Wednesday. Their
negotiator, Steve Nutter of the Service Employees International
Union, said the hospital had been delaying negotiations since the
workers voted to unionize two years ago. He said the union was
demanding two 10% wage increases over the next two years as well as a
100% employer-paid health insurance plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Health-care workers deserve at the very least to have their
health-care needs taken care of," Nutter said.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Rivera, a respiratory therapist at the hospital for seven
years, said another issue is understaffing of vital services.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is frequently assigned seven intensive care patients
when he can only handle four.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe denied that the hospital is stalling negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   New talks are scheduled for next week, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disappointing to receive such a communication at a time
when our negotiation teams are working hard to finalize a contract
covering the technical unit employees of the medical center," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not reached any impasse in the negotiation process," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Pupils' 4 Months Off Irk Parents, Teachers</HD>
<DH>Education: Switch to traditional schedule at Mount Vernon
School, designed to boost academics, means a long break for hundreds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An unusual calendar switch intended to improve academics at one of
the worst-performing schools in Los Angeles instead has provoked
protests because it could keep several hundred students out of school
for four straight months this year.</LD>
<LD>   Parents of students at Mount Vernon Middle School in the Mid-City
area are scrambling to find alternatives to television and video
games to fill all those no-class days.</LD>
<LD>   And some teachers worry that the extra time off will undermine
efforts to raise test scores and leave too many students languishing
over the long break.</LD>
<TE>   Mount Vernon is changing from a year-round calendar with three
staggered tracks to a single traditional schedule that runs from
September to June.</TE>
<TE>   It is the only campus in the Los Angeles Unified School District
returning this year to a traditional calendar while other crowded
campus are being forced in the opposite direction, to year-round
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   The change will add 17 days of school at Mount Vernon and is
welcomed by some teachers as an important tool to improve the school,
one of 10 in the district slated for a series of reforms because of
poor scores on standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   But the new calendar is creating headaches on campus and in homes.
About 600 "C-track" students, who started their school year last July
and ended it April 30, will not return to class until after Labor
Day. That includes some incoming sixth-graders who attended
year-round elementary schools on the C track.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer said the four-month gap for
C-track students is an unavoidable side effect of moving Mount Vernon
to a stable calendar that will be more conducive to learning.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know there is a long-term good," he said. "To get there we
have a short-term problem."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers disagree, calling the switch counterproductive. They
already are angry about other policy changes at the school, including
a dress code for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious the school district really hasn't thought about our
kids," said Allen Riedel, a sixth-grade English teacher and a
teachers union representative.</TE>
<TE>   Officials stress that summer school classes are available
elsewhere. But many parents say those classes are too far away from
the neighborhood and that busing is not provided.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried about my daughter," said Hortencia Lazaro, 37, who
hopes that 12-year-old Daisy will be able to attend a summer class.
"She might forget what she learned in school and become lazy."</TE>
<TE>   With no other activities certain, Daisy plans to read "The Hobbit"
and "The Lord of the Rings"--given to her by a concerned
teacher--over the summer and volunteer at her old elementary school.
But September is far away.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be bored around the house," said Daisy, who will be
a seventh-grader in the fall. "There's not much to do. Just chores."</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon Principal Scott Schmerelson said many students could
actually wind up spending extra time in school if they take advantage
of the so-called intersession and summer school.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 C-track students are making up failing grades during
intersession classes at the campus, he said. Those classes end next
month. Students also can sign up for six weeks of summer school
between July and August at other campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids like summer school," Schmerelson said. "They will
actively wish to go with their friends. I think they will welcome
it."</TE>
<TE>   Other students in the Los Angeles district have experienced a
four-month gap. That happens when C-track youngsters graduate in
April and move on to a middle- or high school with a traditional
calendar that starts in September.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of the district's 660 campuses operate on year-round
schedules and several more are making the change to it soon. Most of
these 224 schools separate students into three staggered tracks, with
two groups of students in session at a time and the third group on
vacation. District officials hope to switch some of the year-round
schools back to the traditional calendar as new schools open their
doors in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Some Mount Vernon teachers are receptive to the change, which will
extend the school year by nearly a month and make it easier to
coordinate training on campus.</TE>
<TE>   The calendar change is just one of many reforms being introduced
at the campus near Crenshaw and Pico boulevards as part of a shakeup
of 10 district schools. L.A. Unified has reassigned administrators
and beefed up training in response to state audits that found poor
instruction and low expectations in those schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon teachers must attend 20 additional days of training
in the coming year. Triggering union protests, employees also must
abide by a new dress code that prohibits jeans and tennis shoes as
well as sign "commitment forms" that require punctuality and
collegial relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers complain that the district did not adequately inform
them--or parents--about the impact of the calendar change.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to apologize to parents," said Doug Brouillard, an
eighth-grade English teacher at Mount Vernon. "I didn't know what to
offer them except a reading list."</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon administrators said they have addressed the issue at
staff gatherings and held a meeting for parents in March to spell
things out. The school also sent letters home this week informing
parents of the summer school option, with a list of campuses from
which to choose.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't forget them," Larry Tash, who oversees middle schools
for the local subdistrict, said of parents.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Murphy, a parent and a classroom aide at the school, has
collected old history and algebra books and computer programs for his
12-year-old daughter, Kelly. He plans to keep her home studying
rather than send her to summer school on city buses that he doesn't
think are safe.</TE>
<TE>   He worries about the impact of the long break on other students.</TE>
<TE>   "Any teacher will tell you that they have to spend a month of
remedial work to catch the kids up from being on vacation for two
months," Murphy said. "What impact will four months have?"</TE>

<LD>Police continued their search Wednesday for two women wanted for
questioning in a fatal stabbing outside a convenience store.</LD>
<LD>   Lucille Jefferson, 22, of Oxnard died at St. John's Regional
Medical Center about 4 a.m. Monday. Jefferson had driven herself to
the hospital after being stabbed near the parking lot of a
convenience store in the 100 block of Rose Avenue. She collapsed in
the emergency room and died after several hours of surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told investigators Jefferson was stabbed after arguing
with two women in a car that was blocking her vehicle, Sgt. Jim Seitz
of the Oxnard Police Department said. It's unclear what role, if any,
the two women played in the stabbing, but they were witnesses, Seitz
said.</LD>
<TE>   Crime Stoppers has offered a $1,000 reward for information on the
stabbing, Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is urged to call 385-8288.</TE>

<HD>Teen Charged in Car Crash That Killed 2 Friends</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Oxnard College student accused of vehicular
manslaughter faces trial later this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard College student has been charged with vehicular
manslaughter stemming from a crash last year in which two of her
friends were killed as the trio drove to a friend's high school
graduation ceremony in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   A trial has been scheduled for May 29 in Ventura County Superior
Court for Sopheak "Sophie" Riem, 19, the driver in the June 11 crash
on the Ventura Freeway, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "This has irrevocably changed her life," said Deputy Public
Defender Leslie Daniels, Riem's attorney. "These were her friends.
She was close to them and she was driving, and she lived and they
didn't. She is devastated."</LD>
<TE>   After investigating the crash for several months, prosecutors
decided to charge Riem with two counts of misdemeanor vehicular
manslaughter. If convicted, she faces a maximum two years in County
Jail.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether Riem was speeding at the time of the
crash--possibly as fast as 80 mph--and whether she made an unsafe
lane change that could have caused her to lose control of her car.</TE>
<TE>   At least one witness has told authorities Riem may have swerved to
miss debris in the roadway before her car careened off the freeway,
Daniels said. That claim remains under investigation, Daniels added.</TE>
<TE>   Riem, who lives with her parents in Oxnard, has pleaded not guilty
and is free on recognizance. Daniels said Riem was knocked
unconscious in the crash and has little recollection of what
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anita Patel declined to comment on the
specifics of the case except to say "we thought after reading the
police reports there was sufficient evidence to show a crime was
committed."</TE>
<TE>   Riem could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Highway Patrol, Riem and her friends
were running an hour late en route to watch another friend graduate
from high school in a ceremony at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   Riem lost control of her car at the Johnson Drive overpass, and
the vehicle careened 60 feet off the roadway, authorities said. Ana
Rosa Uribe, 17, an independent study student at El Camino High in
Ventura, was in the back seat when the car landed upside-down on
railroad tracks, killing her.</TE>
<TE>   The other passenger, Lea Casillas, 16, a member of Buena High's
softball team, died the same day at a local hospital from skull
fractures and other internal injuries. Casillas' family has filed a
lawsuit against the California Department of Transportation, alleging
the agency failed to properly maintain both the roadway and
guardrail.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels said Riem received a broken collar bone and punctured a
lung in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   All three were wearing seat belts and authorities found no
evidence of alcohol or drugs.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / MONTEREY PENINSULA</KH>
<HD>Lone Cypress Poses Proudly for Generations</HD>
<DH>Stately tree clinging to a granite promontory is a
quintessential symbol of the California coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Lone Cypress is the world's most photographed tree, as some
claim, Joann Dost is part of the reason. For more than 20 years, she
has gone out at morning and night, in clear weather and fog, to
capture the elegant lines of the tree and its prow-shaped granite
promontory above the surf of the Monterey Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so interesting how nature can take a tree and have it grow
right out of the rocks," said Dost, a professional photographer who
figures that she has shot thousands of frames of the tree in all hues
of light. One of her favorite times is evening, when the reddening
sun casts shadows across the headlands. "The clouds open up and you
get these wonderful shafts of light," she said. "It lasts maybe two
minutes. It's just a magical spot."</LD>
<LD>   Van Megert, an artist, is also drawn to the Lone Cypress at that
hour. He has spent 30 years with the tree and photographed and
painted it hundreds of times, from every possible angle. Sometimes he
even takes the photographs to his studio in Paris--a city with its
own vast array of landmarks, trees and gardens--and quietly toils on
yet another image of the cypress.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm tired of painting it, but it's a way of paying the bills," he
said with an edge in his voice. "I've made a lot of money painting
it."</TE>
<TE>   Tourists at his gallery in Pebble Beach pay up to $25,000 for the
largest of Van Megert's acrylic seascapes. Many have seen the tree in
magazines. Its wind-raked look and tenacious hold on the rocks
inspires them. The tree is at once stately and mysterious and wild.</TE>
<TE>   Set in nearly flawless composition atop the canted, fissured,
massive wedge of headlands, it symbolizes the California coast as few
landmarks do. "It's the one thing that tourists connect with," the
artist said. "It's something they want to see. If you drive by there
on a typical weekend, they're all getting out of the tour buses at
that spot."</TE>
<TE>   The Lone Cypress is one of a rare species, the Monterey cypress
(Cupressus macrocarpa), that grows only here and on Point Lobos, a
few miles south.</TE>
<TE>   Adapted to the craggy headlands, the trees stoop and sway and seem
to turn the coast into a fairyland. They drip in the blowing mists.
At night you can imagine them shape-shifting into tree goblins. They
reach up to 70 feet in height and live about 300 years.</TE>
<TE>   Stranded on a particularly forlorn, Gibraltar-like formation that
extends directly west, the Lone Cypress is stunted and embattled. It
is held in place by wires and a low retaining wall. A plaque at the
roadside proclaims it "a testament to the hardiness of these trees.
It has withstood Pacific storms and winds for roughly 250 years."</TE>
<TE>   Frances Larkey, who settled on the coast in 1923, was 81 when she
was interviewed about the tree years ago. "There's a kind of lift or
exhilaration you get from just looking at the tree on that impressive
rock," she said. "It's one of those intangibles.... It represents
eternity." Not long after sharing those thoughts, Larkey saved the
tree she so loved from an arson fire. In 1984, someone doused it and
set it burning shortly after midnight, damaging much of the root
system. Larkey's call to authorities kept it from being destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   She died six years ago at age 96. The tree lives on, nurtured by
the Pebble Beach Co. with care befitting an elderly executive. The
tree's value is evident in several ways. It forms the logo of the
renowned Pebble Beach golf resort. Its image is protected by
trademark, meaning the company gets a cut from the many people who
use the tree for commercial purposes--to sell calendars, Christmas
cards, paintings, postcards, posters and sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   The cypress is also a scenic stop on 17 Mile Drive, a loop road
through breathtaking forest and beachfront. For $8, you can spend
much of a day on a two-lane route that begins in the foothills, under
canopies of trees, and descends to long expanses of sun-drenched
rocky beach. The drive passes within a few strides of the flagsticks
of some of America's premier golf courses: Pebble Beach, Poppy Hills,
Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill and Cypress Point. Mansions crown the low
bluffs, which are cloaked with cypresses.</TE>
<TE>   Off Point Joe, an area known as the Restless Sea surges with waves
that seem to collide from half a dozen directions. The Lone Cypress
is beyond that, at stop No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Just when you think there should be no more beauty left to find,
you pull over and step to the railing and see it, as John and Clara
Harrison did. "It's spectacular--unbelievable," he said. "It's
incredible," his wife said.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting from Chicago, they were not only sightseeing, but
thinking about a future home. Florida and Maine had been high on
their list before they reached the Monterey coast. "It's the Garden
of Eden," John Harrison said. "Can you imagine getting up every
morning and walking down the steps and seeing the sea lions?"</TE>
<TE>   The surf pounding on the rocks seems to render the scene all the
more timeless. Kathryn Oboikowitch, who enjoys the breakers more than
anything, stood marveling at the competing elements--the water, the
crumbling granite, the tree looming above. "It's just amazing to see
this piece of green growing out of this rock," she said. There is
nothing like it in Greenville, S.C., where she is from.</TE>
<TE>   Dave and Judy Franz made the same observation. They are from
Rockaway, N.Y. "We love it there," she said, "but it can't compare to
this."</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, a path led out to the Lone Cypress. Now you can't reach
the rock. Wood decks and stairs tumble down the hill below the road.
You can get within 70 yards of the tree, but no closer.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly and Frank Fazio, visiting from a small town in
Pennsylvania, remembered walking out to the tree with their
2-year-old daughter, Barbara, on their last visit. Now their daughter
is full-grown, in her 40s.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were back to satisfy some long-held yearning. "Once
you've seen it, it becomes a memory you want to reenact," Beverly
Fazio said.</TE>
<TE>   They were taking pictures, as nearly everyone does. Frank Fazio
said they planned to compare the two sets--the photos taken now with
the pictures they shot of the Lone Cypress back when JFK was in
office.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Fazio studied the tree carefully. She thought it looked
older, more sparse. "But we're happy to see it's still here," she
said, "and being taken care of."</TE>

<HD>Don't Raze the Nuclear 'Firewall'</HD>
<DH>The wrong U.S. plan could open the door to catastrophic
proliferation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH R. BIDEN Jr.</AU>
<BD>Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) is chairman of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the world's preeminent nuclear power, the United States has an
awesome responsibility to ensure that our weapons deter a nuclear war
rather than produce one. This is no easy task. We must be prepared to
fight a nuclear war, but our real objective is to deter others from
ever starting one. We must also do all we can to prevent others from
developing or using nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Early this year, the Pentagon produced a classified document
called the Nuclear Posture Review, one purpose of which is to clarify
U.S. intentions on nuclear weapons use. That document has raised
serious issues that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations will
examine today. The chief question is whether the review's
recommendations increase the risk of nuclear war.</LD>
<TE>   Another concern is how readily the Nuclear Posture Review leaves
the door open to developing new types of weapons. Maybe the day will
come when we need to do that, but nobody should rush to judgment
without considering the downside. Any truly new nuclear weapon, as
opposed to merely repackaging an existing weapon, would probably
require renewed nuclear testing, which would surely destroy the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and very likely lead other
nuclear weapons states to develop new weapons as well. And that would
probably unravel the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If we did begin
such weapons development, our message to the world would be that we
value nuclear weapons more than we do nonproliferation. And other
countries would take their cue from us.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional countries is a
dangerous and destabilizing event. But for those countries the
commitment never to acquire nuclear weapons requires two leaps of
faith: that the nuclear powers will prevent one's neighbor from
taking advantage of this public-spirited stance and that those same
nuclear powers will not misuse their collective monopoly on such
destructive power.</TE>
<TE>   The maintenance of nuclear deterrent capabilities by the major
powers is most acceptable to nonnuclear weapons states when there is
progress in reducing the size and importance of nuclear forces. The
U.S.-Russia agreement announced Monday is a welcome sign of further
progress. But nonnuclear weapons states can hardly be reassured by
the slow pace of the reductions called for or by the emphasis in the
Nuclear Posture Review on our maintaining maximum flexibility to
rearm.</TE>
<TE>   We have deterred the use of nuclear weapons for more than half a
century, partly by maintaining their character as frightful weapons
of mass destruction. We have made it clear, both to our enemies and
to ourselves, that once a nuclear response is undertaken or invited,
all bets are off as to where it will end. If we develop small nuclear
weapons for missile defense or to strike new targets such as deeply
buried bunkers, we could destroy the firewall against nuclear war
that we and the world have maintained since the end of World War II.
Would that really make us more secure?</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear weapons are weapons of retaliation or last resort. They
are not handy military tools, and we must not allow ourselves to
think of them that way.</TE>

<HD>When Testing Trumps Learning</HD>
<DH>AP courses have come to be misused.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH STIPEK</AU>
<BD>Deborah Stipek is dean of the Stanford School of
Education and the co-author of "Motivated Minds: Raising Children to
Love Learning" (Henry Holt, 2001) and "Motivation to Learn:
Integrating Theory and Practice" (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mom, if I don't get a 4 on my AP history test I will have wasted a
whole year," my daughter exclaimed. "Didn't you learn any history?" I
asked. "That's not what this class is about," she explained in that
how-can-you-be-so-stupid tone familiar to parents of 16-year-olds.
After she took the French Advanced Placement test, her only comment
was that she'll "never again have to speak a word of French."</LD>
<LD>   The sad truth that my daughter's comments illustrate is that AP
courses are not about learning. They are test preparation courses. We
need another strategy for providing challenging instruction.</LD>
<LD>   AP courses were developed in the mid-1950s to challenge students
who had mastered their high school curriculum. It was a simple idea:
By studying college material in high school, students could avoid
introductory courses in college and as college freshmen could delve
deeply into a subject immediately. This idea is consistent with the
research on motivating students and maximizing learning.</LD>
<TE>   But as the AP program has grown exponentially--from 1,200 students
taking the first exam in 1956 to more than 800,000 last year--the
program's purpose has changed. AP tests are no longer about feeding
students' intellectual appetites or exposing them to new ideas,
concepts or cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, AP courses have become a way for students to rise above
the crowded pool of applicants; the tests have become the currency of
college entrance. Not long ago, at least one AP class was considered
essential for admission to a competitive college. Today, the
expectation is four--six for students who are aiming really high.</TE>
<TE>   Universities also are upping the ante. Harvard, for example, has
announced that it will give credit only to students who achieve the
top score of 5 (as opposed to the usual practice of requiring a 3 or
4 for credit). Furthermore, high school reputations rely increasingly
on the percentage of students who pass AP tests, and teachers feel
the heat. Many use practice tests, vocabulary lists, memorization of
math equations and historical facts--whatever it takes to ensure
their students' success.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, many strategies that prepare students for AP tests
contradict everything we know about engaging instruction, the kind of
teaching that makes material relevant to life and generates the
desire to delve deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Students have no time to immerse themselves in a particular
concept or topic. Further, the demands of the courses create anxiety
and take away from time spent on other important activities.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about inequities in students' access to AP courses also
are mounting, since the number of AP courses varies dramatically
across schools. Many schools serving predominantly low-income
students offer none at all.</TE>
<TE>   To end these inequities, school districts are trying to increase
the number of AP classes in schools serving low-income students. This
might address some gross inequities in college access, but I suggest
a more radical response.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing concerns raised in a National Research Council report
about the focus on memorization and superficial coverage, some
schools, such as the private Fieldston School in New York, have
substituted honors courses for AP courses. Thus, students can be
challenged without taking a course that can easily be reduced to test
preparation. And the teachers have the freedom to decide how they
balance depth and breadth.</TE>
<TE>   Let's teach our youth that school is not just about passing tests.
We have gone too far down that road when the notion that learning is
the purpose of school sounds to an adolescent like further evidence
that parents just don't get it.</TE>

<HD>Hostility to Arafat Grows Among the Palestinians</HD>
<DH>The people are losing patience with his corrupt and
repressive regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMIR TAHERI</AU>
<BD>Amir Taheri is a writer for Arab News, an
English-language newspaper in Saudi Arabia. E-mail: amtaher@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Presented by his propaganda as "the renewal of the pledge between the
leader and the people," Yasser Arafat's tour of Palestinian towns
this week had been planned as a triumphal march for the self-styled
president. Instead, it turned into a long-overdue exercise in
humiliation for Arafat and provided further evidence of deep-rooted
hostility to his leadership among Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   In Jenin, where his men had hoped for dramatic television footage,
Arafat hurried back into his bulletproof car after it became clear
that the 3,000-strong crowd waiting in the devastated refugee camp
would give him a rough time. In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city,
he drew just 250 people, mostly employees of his administration.</LD>
<LD>   "Arafat is not interested in us and we are not interested in him,"
said Muhammad Abu-Ghalyoun, a former inhabitant of the Jenin camp.
"He has no business in Palestine."</LD>
<TE>   As long as Arafat was a virtual prisoner in Ramallah, few
Palestinians were prepared to criticize him. Now, however, voices are
being raised against his autocratic, inefficient and corrupt regime.
Many Palestinians still fear Arafat's "hit squads," which have
established a tradition of assassinating political adversaries and
potential rivals since the 1960s. Hence the reluctance of some to be
quoted by name. Others, however, are prepared to take the risk, a
sign that Arafat's hold on the Palestinians is loosening.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is running the areas under his control for the sole
purpose of making money for his cronies and international glory for
himself," said Yahya Ibrahim, a Palestinian businessman.</TE>
<TE>   So widespread is knowledge of the corruption Arafat presides over
that he and his Cabinet of 40 ministers are routinely referred to as
Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. The European Union, the Arab states and
Israel (in the form of customs income) have poured about $3 billion
into Arafat's coffers since 1994. Arafat has spent part of it
creating his repressive machine, which consists of 12 separate
security agencies--all answerable to him--a ubiquitous police force
and, believe it or not, a miniature navy of which he is admiral.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has insisted on controlling every account and signing every
check for more than $10,000. A survey of the contracts awarded by his
administration reveals that the lion's share went to his relatives,
his cronies and a few powerful businessmen linked to the family of
his wife, Suha.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is naive if he thinks Arafat is the man to clean the mess,"
one Palestinian journalist said privately. "Arafat is at the center
of a system of corruption. There can be no reform unless Arafat
goes."</TE>
<TE>   Corruption is only one reason why more Palestinians do not want
Arafat. Another is repression. Arafat refuses to arrest alleged
terrorists wanted by Israel but has no qualms about jailing his
opponents. Since 1994, an estimated 12,000 Palestinians have spent
time in Arafat's jails. This is the equivalent of having more than
1.2 million political prisoners in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists are imprisoned or beaten up by Arafat's thugs for such
"crimes" as not putting the leader's photograph on the front page.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's machine employs about 70,000 people, half of them armed
men, in a population of 2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also is criticized for his lack of interest in the
bread-and-butter issues of his community. He has spent much of his
time traveling abroad or entertaining foreign dignitaries. From 1994
to the end of 2001, when Ariel Sharon imposed a travel ban on him,
Arafat made 83 foreign visits to 44 countries. Because his wife and
daughter live in Paris, he also spent much time there. The only time
Arafat spent more than two consecutive months in
Palestinian-controlled areas was the five months Israel kept him
under virtual house arrest in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat got himself elected chairman of the Palestinian Authority
(he prefers the title of president) in 1994 with 83% of the votes in
an arranged election boycotted by nearly 40% of the electorate.
Although an elected parliament is functioning--weakly--under the
constitution, Arafat rules by decree. These decrees, known as
"presidential acts," often contravene laws passed by the parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has shown himself incapable of developing a peace strategy
for his people. In the last 30 years, more than a dozen peace plans
have been proposed by various Arab and Israeli leaders, but there has
never been an Arafat plan.</TE>
<TE>   He has lied and cheated his way through a tumultuous career that
has made him one of the richest men in the Arab world. He has been a
friend to everyone and to no one.</TE>
<TE>   Once an officer in the Egyptian army, Arafat started his career as
a Palestinian liberation leader with more than a nod from Cairo.
Later, he had no qualms about betraying his Egyptian mentors and
praising the assassins of President Anwar Sadat.</TE>
<TE>   The emir of Kuwait financed him for years, but Arafat betrayed the
Kuwaitis in 1990 by siding with Saddam Hussein. In 1971, the Syrians
saved him from certain death in Jordan. But he lost no time in
betraying them too.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, American Marines saved Arafat from capture by Sharon's
troops in Lebanon. In 1991, he repaid the U.S. and its allies by
siding with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Is Arafat the "inevitable" Palestinian interlocutor that Secretary
of State Colin Powell claims? The answer coming from the Palestinians
and the Muslim world in general is an emphatic no. Arab and other
Muslim leaders will not call for Arafat's demise as long as Sharon
does. But there is a growing feeling that the Palestinians need a
new, younger, better-educated and cleaner leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, of course, will not give up easily and is still capable of
having potential rivals murdered. But the outside world, especially
the European Union, can help clean up the mess by denying him control
of the aid money. Just as the United Nations has oversight on how
Iraq spends its oil money, the foreign aid that has helped Arafat
build a mini-empire should be subject to some control.</TE>
<TE>   The next general election in the Palestinian Authority, due next
year, should be organized under international auspices so Arafat
cannot use his money and police to arrange the results again. Clean
elections in the territories could see radical Islamists win some
parliamentary seats. But most regional experts think the Islamists
would not have a majority. There is a silent majority for peace among
the Palestinians, but Arafat has no interest in letting it become
vocal.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has lived long while young Palestinians and Israelis have
died. His political demise could allow the young generation on both
sides to seek a different future.</TE>

<HD>A Small Idea Whose Time Has Come Again</HD>
<DH>Amid midlife and oil crises, Britain's Mini automobile is
hip and here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You will be tempted to scoff when I tell you that the popularity of
the new Mini automobile could be politically expedient. But it won't
sound so strange when I remind you that the original Morris Mini
Minor on which the snappy new Mini Cooper is modeled was invented for
just that purpose.</LD>
<LD>   The Turkish-born Sir Alec Issigonis introduced the Morris Mini in
Britain in 1959 to meet the need for fuel-efficient cars after the
Suez conflict of 1956 precipitated an energy crisis there.</LD>
<LD>   Here we are, fingerprints on a botched coup in oil-producing
Venezuela, prostrating ourselves to the strutting Saudis and sizing
up wildlife refuges in our own backyard, all for the sake of the
petroleum we need to gas up those grotesque tanks the Joneses are
driving to the mall.</LD>
<TE>   Many of us have been bemoaning the behemoth sport utility vehicles
in our midst for some time, hoping that corporate Waterloos like the
Firestone-Ford debacle would pluck them out of the market. But it
seems they are as popular as ever, if only because people feel
they've got to "supersize" to survive any crash with the likes of a
Chevy Suburban, which is bigger than most bathrooms. You could park a
Mini inside one.</TE>
<TE>   But why would you want to, when this jazzed-up version of the
classic is so, well, cute? Now, you may ask yourself how something
that costs $16,850 can be considered cute. Remember, we are talking
about the funny-looking car British comedian Rowan Atkinson drove as
the dorky Mr. Bean. Yes, Minis are comic. But cool? Even Volkswagen's
retro-chic New Beetle, which is cute enough to hug, never quite made
it to cool.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mini has, or so it would seem, since the waiting period to
get one of the zippier S series cars is six to eight months. One
dealer says his waiting list includes a 72-year-old woman and a
16-year-old guy.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, a certain cachet does come from the fact that Mini is
owned by BMW. That explains the shoe-box-luxury feel of the thing,
the vamped-up engineering and sassy advertising slogans like "Goliath
lost" and "Soon, small will mean huge the way bad means good."</TE>
<TE>   When you look at the vaguely Barbarella interior--all-leather with
a few bulbous thingamajigs--you feel sure that an absurdly gadgeted
version of this toaster will be featured in the next James Bond film.
Or maybe Austin Powers.</TE>
<TE>   So why is the Mini, which was never a popular car in this country,
coming back? Well, first off, Minis did used to be hip among a
certain crowd. John Lennon, Peter Sellers and Twiggy all drove them,
and Mary Quant named her famous skirt after them; we've always been
slaves to Anglophilic fashion. Think of it as British invasion redux.</TE>
<TE>   The boomers are squarely in the midst of their midlife crises.
What could be more appropriate?</TE>
<TE>   It's the same reason you're hearing "Born to Be Wild" and "Teenage
Wasteland" used in television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine enviro-friendly Bill Clinton driving one of these
with Buddy II in the passenger seat, head thrust ecstatically out the
window, canine cheeks flapping in the breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Now just pipe in the Moody Blues and you've got yourself a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign for the Democratic National
Committee.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is like a medieval castle,
constantly under siege. Now, just as the inhabitants are making
progress on repairing their crumbling fortifications--pushing up test
scores, shrinking overcrowded classes, building desperately needed
outposts--the black plague of a state budget deficit hits.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis' budget plan succeeds in protecting the money to
pay for what are considered essential education costs, for example,
teachers and textbooks. But the shrinking state coffers still mean
less money for so-called optional expenses, and some costs, such as
education for the disabled, are rising. So today, the Los Angeles
school board will grapple with how to cut $45 million from its
$5.2-billion budget.</LD>
<LD>   The members have made many tough decisions: They have raised the
average class size in the fourth through 12th grades to 40 or more
students, doubled the number of failing second-graders in remedial
classes, slightly increased the size of special-education classes.
They have even more unhappy choices to make.</LD>
<TE>   But the district's children and parents should rise up in revolt
if school board President Caprice Young and her six colleagues don't
scramble to simultaneously staunch the hemorrhaging of funds from
within.</TE>
<TE>   One way to do this is to ask the district's inspector general to
aggressively audit every outside consultant and contract and justify
each penny spent.</TE>
<TE>   As things stand, the district pays $104million to outside
consultants and contractors, not even counting those hunting for
sites for new schools, making repairs on campuses and protecting
environmental health. All should be examined.</TE>
<TE>   The consulting approach, initiated in part to import outside
expertise and deflate the LAUSD's notoriously bloated bureaucracy,
can work well. Excellent retired teachers, for example, return to
help poorly performing teachers improve--and the district doesn't
have to pay additional benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But using outsiders can also waste money, as Inspector General Don
Mullinax documented in his investigation of the Belmont Learning
Complex, where conflicts of interest and appallingly bad advice cost
the district millions.</TE>
<TE>   Now the board should tell Mullinax to set up a contract audit unit
to do background checks, analyze winning bids to avoid expensive
change orders, make sure the LAUSD has good billing and
cost-accounting systems and examine invoices and work before final
checks are cut.</TE>
<TE>   These savings will go only so far toward protecting the LAUSD's
long-suffering students and teachers from additional hardships. But
crowded classrooms and dirty schools would at least be easier to take
without the nagging suspicion that district officials are squandering
cash on consultants with better connections than skills.</TE>

<HD>Finish Campaign Reform</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Tuesday, the Republican Party smashed soft-money fund-raising
records by wooing corporate chieftains at a dinner headlined by
President Bush. About $30 million, the lion's share of it soft money,
was collected.</LD>
<LD>   If any further proof were needed of the importance of the campaign
finance reform that Congress passed in March, the dinner provided it.
But as a bipartisan task force created by the group Democracy 21
shows in a lengthy report called "No Bark, No Bite, No Point," the
campaign laws, which go into effect after midterm elections, will be
meaningless unless the toothless Federal Election Commission is shut
down and replaced by a new regulatory agency.</LD>
<LD>   The six-member commission's public mandate is to enforce campaign
finance law. But Congress actually designed the commission,
established in 1974, to be ineffective and impotent, fearing it could
damage individual member's careers. Structural problems abound. For
one thing, the commission can have no more than three members of the
same political party. On high-profile decisions, deadlock has
resulted. The commission found, for example, that the 1996 Dole for
President Committee had received illegal contributions from the
Republican National Committee but tied 3 to 3 on whether to pursue
enforcement action.</LD>
<TE>   In 2002, the commission again voted 3 to 3 not to investigate
whether a group called Republicans for Clean Air, funded by Texas
multimillionaires Sam and Charles Wyly, violated the law in spending
$2 million on a television campaign attacking Sen. John McCain a week
before the 2000 Super Tuesday primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Partisanship at the agency is so blatant that this year Chairman
David Mason and Commissioner Bradley A. Smith helped the House
Republican leadership try to kill the Shays-Meehan campaign finance
bill. Mason has called the bill flatly unconstitutional and Smith
branded it a sham. Yet now that it has been passed, both men are
supposed to enforce its provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and the president need to start over and establish an
agency capable of enforcing the law. The most basic reform would be
to create an election agency modeled on the General Accounting Office
that would be headed by a single administrator who would be subject
to Senate confirmation and serve a term that did not overlap with the
president who appointed him or her. This would help guard against the
partisanship that cripples the commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Democracy 21 group also recommends establishing a panel of
administrative law judges that would decide accusations of election
law violation brought to it by the new agency. The panel would also
act as a check against potential abuses of power by the administrator
of that GAO-style agency.</TE>
<TE>   Far from having finished with reform, Congress needs to take this
next critical step.</TE>

<LD>Everyone is teed off in Sacramento. That's a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats in the Legislature are recoiling at the prospect of
substantial cuts in state health and welfare programs as Gov. Gray
Davis attempts to plug a $23.6-billion budget hole. Some are
muttering about an increase in state income taxes to restore the
funds cut by Davis, even though the GOP would certainly block such a
proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans are railing at increased taxes on cigarettes, deferred
deductions on business taxes and restoration of the "car tax" on
which former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, staked his tax-cutting
reputation.</LD>
<TE>   What nobody has is a detailed better idea.</TE>
<TE>   There is no easy way to make up a shortfall that amounts to nearly
one-third of the annual state budget and could, over the next few
months, keep growing. The state grew fat on capital gains in Silicon
Valley's boom years. Davis is paying the price for putting too much
of the money into the expansion of programs rather than one-shot
spending like bridge repairs and state park improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, after the brutally lean early 1990s it was impossible to
resist new spending on health care and education, both of which had
been neglected. But capital gains revenue is too volatile to count on
year to year and should probably be handled differently from income
tax revenue. The Legislature needs to be part of that decision so a
governor does not bear all the political onus of restricting one kind
of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Davis has assembled a stew of loans, new or restored
taxes and early payments (such as state income from the tobacco
fund), as well as spending cuts. Even in a matter this huge, it
amounts to the kind of unexciting some-from-here-and-some-from-there
compromise on which Davis has built his career. It's also hard, on
this issue, to disagree with that approach.</TE>
<TE>   Good people can fight about whether child care should suffer more
and health spending less. About the exact mix of short-term loans and
spending cuts. About whose ox was gored worst. About whether Davis is

<LD>Re "It's Too Early for a Palestine State," Commentary, May 14: Avi
Davis should certainly provoke a large and vocal response with his
call for a return to the 19th century, the century of European
imperialism. Every caricature from that period appears in Davis'
polemic. I find it hard to credit that in these supposedly modern
times there are still some who believe that it is the white man's
duty to bring enlightenment to the hapless Palestinians. But, it is
our burden, so we must lead them out of the error of their ways--as
soon as we crush them, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Looking at the recent involvement of the U.S. in the Mideast, it
seems to me that the hapless people we need to establish hegemony
over are probably the Israelis. Despite all the money, weaponry and
political cover we have given them, they seem unable to establish a
state of internal peace and security. Yes, it is a dirty job; but it
is our duty, as the great white warriors, to occupy Israel and lead
the benighted Israelis in the ways of progress and enlightenment.</LD>

years now since the U.S. breathed life into the state of Israel. It's
time now for the U.S., in the name of justice and humanitarianism, to
do the same for the people of Palestine. If it has to wait for Ariel

<LD>Re "U.S., Russia to Cut Nuclear Arms," May 14: I find it highly
disturbing that the Bush administration adamantly insisted on moving
the nuclear warheads into storage, as opposed to destroying them, as
a condition for signing the arms reduction treaty with Russia. As was
correctly pointed out in your article, moving the weapons into
storage facilities whose security is extremely marginal accomplishes
nothing except raising the very real possibility that the weapons
will find their way into the hands of terrorists or rogue nations.
Have we learned nothing from Sept. 11?</LD>
<LD>   Once again, the Bush administration is posturing in a
window-dressing effort to gain PR points with the electorate, rather
than addressing the real problem.</LD>

<LD>Jamie Court virtually accused the Assembly Health Committee of
selling out to the insurance industry by refusing to pass a number of
legislative proposals mandating new health benefits for health plan
enrollees (Commentary, May 8). His accusation is both insulting to
committee members and lacking in any understanding of the needs of
working families.</LD>
<LD>   What the committee recognized is that rising health-care costs are
threatening the ability of many employers and individuals to afford
insurance, and that the greatest public need right now is not new
benefits but the ability to afford the benefits already in place. At
a time when the economy is unsteady, when approximately 7 million
Californians are without any insurance at all, when the state deficit
is approaching $25 billion and when premium increases are already
substantial, it is clear that the committee took a responsible step.</LD>

<HD>Carter's Cuban Visit and the U.S. Embargo</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kudos to Jimmy Carter for becoming the first American president to
visit Cuba since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution and takeover (May
13-15). As a libertarian, I remain a staunch advocate of
representative democracy and basic human rights. I feel Carter's
action undermines the most damaging policy our government has
undertaken to deal with Castro's insidious regime, the Helms-Burton
Act. Initiating a wide array of embargoes on Castro's government has
only served to strengthen his hold on Cuba and justify his misled
despotism.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. needs to approach the democratization of Cuba in the same
fashion that it has so far approached China--using free trade as a
catalyst for greater freedoms. The Helms-Burton Act only tightens the
tyranny of the Castro regime at the expense of everyday Cuban
citizens.</LD>

<TE>   Why in the world would a former president go to a communist
country to bad-mouth his own country? And this while we are at war!
This guy showed us all that he was a fool when we elected him, and he
continues to do so. Either leave Carter in Cuba forever or send him
back to the farm.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants to have it both ways with regard to
its claims that Cuba is creating biological weapons. As usual, a
close look at the language separates spin from reality. According to
President Bush's undersecretary of State for arms control, "The
United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive
biological warfare research and development effort." The word
"effort" clearly implies that Cuba is actually working to this end.</TE>
<TE>   Contrast this with Secretary of State Colin Powell's attempt to
backpedal when he said, "We didn't say that [Cuba] actually had some
weapons but it has the capacity and capability to conduct such
research." Well, so does my daughter's kindergarten class. As the
Bush administration continues to play the terrorist card
indiscriminately for its own ends (here to undermine Carter's visit),
post-9/11 caution becomes fear-mongering and reeks of political
opportunism. This sort of irresponsible spin and hyperbole is in
danger of undermining the administration's credibility at a time when
vigilance and accurate assessments of the world situation are of dire
importance.</TE>

<TE>   If the administration is afraid that Castro would sell biotech
information for money, then why not just let him trade with us for
the cash? It is a win-win situation for both countries. We do not
need the Miami Cubans dictating American policy anymore. Enough is
enough!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Kids or Cash: Why Force Women to Choose?" Opinion, May 12: Ann
Crittenden's poignant opinion on Sylvia Ann Hewlett's "Creating a
Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children" considers only
one side of the coin. The other side--fathers--is glaringly absent.
Women do indeed provide the womb for reproduction. And many continue
to work their regular jobs during this time. But once out of the
womb, children have two parents. I have never seen any media hype
over the adverse effects on children whose fathers are rarely around
because they work 50-plus hours.</LD>
<LD>   We are so quick to criticize divorced mothers or deadbeat dads.
But why don't we expect fathers with high-powered careers to make the
appropriate sacrifices for their children? Fathers also should
consider taking on less-prestigious careers and taking more time off.
I know a handful of fathers who choose their children over their
work. They take paternity leave, reduce their work hours, change
career paths or stay at home while their wives work--all so they can
witness their children's first steps, tuck them into bed and attend
their soccer games. But there are still far too few of these men. In
this culture, mothers, more often than not, choose to leave
themselves behind and take care of their children. Isn't it time we
expect fathers to do the same?</LD>

They have to face "harsh, either-or choices between children and
well-paying jobs." What will Crittenden and her high-powered female
moguls have to endure next--a mind-bending choice between a vanilla
ice cream cone and chocolate-covered bonbons? A red BMW or a
candy-apple Lamborghini?</TE>

<LD>Re "Tackling the NFL's Idea for a New Stadium," by Steve Lopez, May
12: The NFL is conniving with a few L.A. insiders to use public
downtown-L.A. redevelopment funds for a stadium: This looks like the
next chapter of the story that we are suffering through in San Diego.
The public here has been plucked to a point of pain by the Chargers,
since our local political patsies agreed to use public taxes to buy
unsold tickets--after the Chargers let us spend a lot of tax money to
build a huge stadium that they can't fill with fans.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Chargers are saying they don't want to be in San Diego,
after collecting this unearned gift, and they are talking about
moving to L.A. I'm sure there is some link there. I think that they
see a fresh big bird to pluck. Misery loves company, so I almost want
to sit back and see the story unfold. Actually, I wish that we could
put an end to this abuse of the public by sports promoters. That tax
money is needed for roads, hospitals, sewers and schools, not some
quarterback's private jet.</LD>

<LD>As a former third-generation Valleyite, I read your May 13 Commentary
page about Valley secession, "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," with some
knowledge of the issues. The theme of the anti-secession commentaries
seemed to be that the Valley has no culture, no great museums, no
public transportation, no fine arts facilities. These reasons show
why the Valley should secede. The Valley paid (in taxes) for a great
percentage of these public projects to be built, yet none are placed
in the Valley. As its own city, maybe the Valley could build cultural
facilities in its own neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   I now live in Redondo Beach, which has no world-class cultural
places yet seems to manage fine. The question should have been
whether L.A. can survive without the Valley, not vice versa.</LD>

<HD>O.C. Doctor May Have Planned to Help Fund Terror, Israel
Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Aid worker detained with the Anaheim physician and
held eight days calls the charges, published in newspapers, baseless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In their first official explanation for detaining an American aid
worker, Israeli authorities said in newspaper reports Wednesday that
Anaheim doctor Riad Abdelkarim may have been planning to use a U.S.
charity to help fund "terror attacks" by the Hamas militant
organization.</LD>
<LD>   But the Israeli charges were dismissed as "baseless" by another
aid worker who was detained with Abdelkarim and released this week
after signing papers that will prevent her from returning to Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas charity worker Dalell Mohmed said Wednesday that the
Israeli allegations against Abdelkarim were meant to divert attention
from his imprisonment and from international criticism of the Jewish
state's treatment of humanitarian aid workers.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a horrific experience, a Kafkaesque experience," said
Mohmed, 47, as she described her eight-day detention in Israel at a
Los Angeles news conference Wednesday. "The urgent task now is to
secure Riad's immediate release."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspapers Ha'aretz and the Jerusalem Post reported in
Wednesday's editions that Tel Aviv courts had partially lifted a gag
order on the case and extended Abdelkarim's detention for seven days
while police and security officials probed his activities with the
Holy Land Foundation, based in Richardson, Texas. Officials offered
no evidence of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, an Islamic relief organization, was outlawed in
Israel in 1997 and the United States in December on charges that it
helped fund Hamas suicide bombings and other terrorist activities.
The foundation has denied the accusations and is suing the federal
government for freezing its funds. Mohmed had been the foundation's
emergency relief coordinator, and Abdelkarim joined the board last
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim was questioned about his Holy Land activities by the
FBI after the Sept. 11 attacks and found to be uninvolved in
terrorist activities. He had also traveled to Israel without incident
as recently as January.</TE>
<TE>   On his most recent trip, the Anaheim doctor's stated aim was to
assess the medical needs of Palestinians at the request of a Los
Angeles-based global humanitarian organization. Mohmed said she went
to Israel May 2 to set up a charity for Palestinian children,
KinderUSA.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I was employed by Holy Land and released, while
Riad had been on the board less than one year, tells you these
charges are bogus," said Mohmed, an Indiana native. She added that
Israel's "main mission was to prevent humanitarian goods from coming
in."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Israel has come under fire from organizations
ranging from the International Red Cross to the United Nations for
arresting aid workers, shooting at them, blocking ambulances from
serving the wounded and other actions criticized as violations of the
Geneva Convention.</TE>
<TE>   During three days of interrogations typically lasting more than 15
hours, Mohmed said, authorities did not significantly focus on Holy
Land or KinderUSA. She said they repeated "mindless" questions about
her family and Israel itinerary, exhorting her to "come clean."</TE>
<TE>   After detaining her May 5 at gunpoint at her hotel, Israeli
officials refused to give the reason for her detention, saying only
that it was a "security matter" and never presented any evidence of
any crimes, she said. Mohmed, who maintained a hunger strike
throughout her ordeal, said she was kept in near-solitary confinement
in a small, rat-infested cell.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was shackled and chained during transfers to
interrogations, but never physically mistreated.</TE>
<TE>   Mohmed said, however, that she heard Abdelkarim screaming in the
next room: "Stop! Stop this now!" and believed he was being tortured.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli consular official in Los Angeles said he had no
information on the case.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. consular officials who met Abdelkarim had reported that he
seemed in adequate condition, but Mohmed said the officials were
incompetent.</TE>
<TE>   She said they did nothing to seek her release and asked only if
she had adequate toiletries.</TE>
<TE>   She contrasted her experience with the presidential welcome at the
White House for two American missionaries released from Taliban
custody in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Is my life not as worthy?" she asked. "Is Riad's life not as
worthy?"</TE>

<HD>9 Months Adrift, College's Boat Lands on Island</HD>
<DH>Sailing: The Bonaire, abandoned by its Orange County crew
after it became disabled, is stripped of its equipment by people on
Nonouti, where it came to rest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apparently, the Bonaire had some life left after all.</LD>
<LD>   Abandoned last July by a novice group of Orange Coast College
sailing students and a professional crew, the disabled 66-foot ketch
turned up on a tropical island in the Central Pacific--about 3,000
miles from where it was abandoned.</LD>
<LD>   The unmanned sailboat had an unceremonious greeting from residents
of the island of Nonouti, who stripped the vessel of everything from
radios to life rafts to a toilet.</LD>
<TE>   "I asked them why they were taking it apart," John Francis, 22, a
Peace Corps volunteer on the island said in a telephone interview
this week. "They all were saying, 'Since the people didn't want the
boat, it's ours now.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Bonaire made headlines last summer when frantic Orange County
relatives tried to get word on crew members, who waited anxiously for
a few days until they were able to hitch rides on passing commercial
ships bound for Panama. After it was abandoned, many people,
including the crew, assumed it would sink.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the 24-year-old racer, donated to the college in
November 2000, drifted for about nine months until it washed onto a
coral reef about 200 yards from the beach of Nonouti--an island just
south of the equator and east of the international date line. It is
part of the Republic of Kiribati, formerly known as the Gilbert
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Francis said the boat appeared to be in fair shape when he first
inspected it about 24 hours after he heard a local radio report about
the vessel becoming marooned in early April. Fine, except for a hole
in the hull he believes was caused by landing on the jagged reef.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it could have made it all that way with a hole in
the bottom," said Francis, whose father, Jim Francis of Jacksonville,
Fla., became curious about the Bonaire and spent weeks searching the
Internet for information before finding news articles about the crew
and the ship.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Francis e-mailed The Times this week with the rest of
the saga of the Bonaire, and provided a telephone number for his son,
who was reached in Kiribati's capital, Tarawa, where he was attending
a Peace Corps conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Bonaire left Hawaii on July 15 with an eight-man crew--five
OCC students and three experienced yachtsman--to return to the
mainland. On July 23, about 800 miles off of Hawaii, the step
supporting the 80-foot mainmast collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   With the rigging suddenly loosened, the mast dropped and swung
around, leaving the crew able to exert little control.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that the mast might punch a hole through the hull and
leave them stranded, crew members sought help from passing ships. The
first group found a ride July 25. The others left shortly afterward,
and all arrived in Panama--lacking passports--in early August.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Bennett, director of the Orange Coast College foundation that
owned the ketch, said he was amazed to learn of the Bonaire's
3,000-mile journey.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel was one of several used by the college, which has one
of the nation's largest nonprofit sailing schools, with more than
6,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the college's insurance company negotiated a reward
for returning the boat to Los Angeles. "When the boat wasn't found in
two months, the insurance company paid us off in full."</TE>
<TE>   The insurance company's broker said there is no interest in
salvaging what remains of the vessel.</TE>

<HD>Guard to Quit Bridge Duty Except at Golden Gate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Armed California National Guard troops, a familiar sight on the
state's major bridges since a terrorist threat in November, will be
pulled off all but the Golden Gate Bridge by the end of the month,
Gov. Gray Davis announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The governor said the National Guard will continue anti-terrorism
duty on the Golden Gate Bridge because it is a national treasure, but
security will be reevaluated in the coming months.</LD>
<LD>   The National Guard will be replaced by local law enforcement
agencies and the Highway Patrol at the Vincent Thomas Bridge in Los
Angeles, the Coronado Bridge in San Diego and the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</LD>
<TE>   Davis ordered the National Guard to protect the four bridges on
Nov. 2 after federal agencies relayed terrorist threats, which later
were deemed not credible. Some politicians criticized Davis for
alarming the public, while others defended him.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Denise Varner, a National Guard spokeswoman, said about 100
soldiers were deployed on the bridges.</TE>
<TE>   The National Guard also was sent to major airports for security
duty but the troops were removed earlier this month. About 800
soldiers were used.</TE>

economic sense to penalize individuals during a recession by raising
their taxes."</LD>
<TE>   Guess the recession is over. But the state's budget deficit is
almost twice as big, growing from $12.5 billion then to $23.6 billion
now.</TE>
<TE>   Davis told reporters Tuesday he was prepared to fill a $20-billion
hole "without a tax increase, but $24 billion crosses the line."</TE>
<TE>   So he offered a revised budget of $99 billion for the fiscal year
starting July 1, including $76.5 billion for the crucial general
fund. And he proposed socking it to motorists, cigarette smokers and
some businesses for about $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But that's just for openers. The most important announcement
Tuesday was not that Davis is proposing to raise specific taxes, but
that he is ready to raise taxes at all. He opened the door to a
buffet of tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "In for a penny, in for a pound," observed liberal Senate leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco). Burton long ago proposed raising
income taxes by $2.5 billion on the wealthiest--couples with taxable
incomes exceeding $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's not tax increases that Burton and other liberal lawmakers
object to, but the onerous program cuts. While protecting popular
school programs, Davis targeted the poor, who tend not to vote. He
proposed, for example, reducing dental exams for children on Medi-Cal
and eliminating them entirely for adults.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' staff drilled home the fiscal realities at a final budget
meeting May 6, explaining the consequences of not raising taxes. "He
wasn't ready to dismantle state government and that was the
alternative," says spokesman Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   "Like, close down the Department of Aging, things like that,"
recalls political strategist Garry South. "You just can't ravage the
services on which people depend in order to meet some self-imposed
goal of not raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   It was a Wilsonesque problem that called for a Wilsonesque
solution. When Republican Gov. Pete Wilson faced a comparable general
fund deficit in 1991, he raised taxes even higher than Davis is
proposing. But, of course, Davis isn't through with this exercise
yet.</TE>
<TE>   And while the governor earned some credit for courage, it wasn't
much. He really had no choice but to increase taxes. And it doesn't
take much courage in California to slap a higher tax on nicotine
addicts.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga has a
point when he says: "If the governor really had political courage,
he'd be proposing taxes that kick in before voters go to the polls in
November. This is just political cowardice."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' hikes wouldn't go into effect until January. Aides say it
would take DMV computers that long to crank up for the stiffer
vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, demagoguery expands with the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-tax Republicans shout it's all Davis' fault; he created this
crisis by overspending.</TE>
<TE>   Nevermind that Davis' spending increases have been less, by
percentage, than Wilson's in his second term and Ronald Reagan's in
both terms. But the stock market did tumble and the dot-com economy
crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Davis claims that Republicans have a duty to propose their own
balanced budget. His strategists are "throwing down the gauntlet."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry. Republicans--and especially GOP gubernatorial candidate
Bill Simon--have absolutely no responsibility to develop a budget.
There's only one governor and one party running the Legislature. This
is a Davis-Democrat problem.</TE>
<TE>   And their main problem is that while Democrats dominate the
Capitol, they're still four votes short in the Assembly and one in
the Senate of being able to pass a budget by the required two-thirds
majority vote. They can either buy off some Republicans with pork, as
they did last year, or play it smart.</TE>
<TE>   Davis instinctively is a loner, but this is a time when he needs
to be gregarious. He can't afford to allow budget squabbling to drag
into midsummer, making the Republicans' case for failed leadership.
Davis needs to do something he hasn't done since his rookie year:
invite in Republicans--and Democrats--to seriously negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Why would Republicans do that and help Davis? Because what matters
in any Capitol is to matter--be relevant, contribute, be in the real
game and not just jeering on the sidelines. That's more important to
Republicans, you can bet, than just scoring points for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always willing to do the good government thing if they give
us the opportunity," says Brulte.</TE>
<TE>   "Basic Politics 101," notes Assembly GOP leader Dave Cox of Fair
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson dealt with Democrats. Davis should deal with Republicans.
But that may take more courage than raising taxes.</TE>

<HD>Panel Confirms Nominee for Prisons Director</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Senate Rules Committee backs the governor's choice
to head the Department of Corrections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The man chosen by the governor to run California's massive prison
system won unanimous confirmation by a key Senate committee Wednesday
at a hearing notable for its friendly, bipartisan tone.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-0 vote by the Rules Committee means Department of
Corrections Director Edward S. Alameida is all but certain to win the
endorsement of the full Senate in the next few months.</LD>
<LD>   Alameida, 52, is a former warden and 29-year corrections veteran.
He has been running the 47,000-employee department since his
appointment by Gov. Gray Davis in September. The Rules Committee
chairman, Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco), was remarkably upbeat
about Alameida, saying, "We want to help you do the job."</LD>
<TE>   Frequently, legislative hearings involving the penal system put
its leaders on the hot seat for the problems plaguing state prisons.
But on Wednesday, Alameida faced only a handful of questions from
senators and opposition from only two witnesses--with nine testifying
in support.</TE>
<TE>   "This attitude of punishment instead of healing permeates every
layer of the California Department of Corrections," said Cayenne
Bird, founder of an inmate advocacy group. Burton's inquiry focused
largely on the department's efforts to prepare inmates for release
and, it hopes, prevent them from landing back in prison. Statistics
show that 56% of California's parolees return to prison within two
years. Burton said the elimination of many programs because of budget
cuts in recent years is partly to blame. Alameida agreed. Alameida's
confirmation comes at a time of challenges for the department, which
houses 157,000 inmates in 33 prisons and 41 conservation camps on an
annual budget of $4.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A father of three, Alameida began his corrections career as an
accountant at Folsom State Prison. In 1996, he became warden at
Deuel, a 4,000-inmate prison in Tracy.</TE>

<HD>Paul Ecke Jr., 76; Made Poinsettia U.S.' Top-Selling Potted
Plant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Ecke Jr., a horticulturist whose innovations transformed the
poinsettia into the country's best-selling potted plant, died of
pancreatic cancer Monday at his Encinitas home. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Ecke turned his father's north San Diego County ranch into the
nation's largest producer of poinsettias, the distinctive
red-and-green plant that has become a holiday season fixture. Of 65
million potted poinsettias sold in the United States in 2000, about
80% got their start at the Paul Ecke Ranch, founded in Encinitas in
1923 by Ecke's father.</LD>
<LD>   "The poinsettia 50 years ago was a very minor plant. The Paul Ecke
Ranch and Paul Jr. in particular made it the No. 1 container plant in
America," said H. Marc Cathey, president emeritus of the American
Horticultural Society.</LD>
<TE>   What made Ecke's accomplishment remarkable was the relatively
short selling season for the poinsettia, which is available only
about six weeks a year, from mid-November to late December.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Paul Ecke Sr., developed the first poinsettia that
could be successfully grown as an indoor potted plant. He began
selling the vividly hued plants, native to Mexico, in the early 1900s
from roadside stands in Hollywood, growing them in open fields along
Sunset Boulevard, which drew busloads of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1923, when urbanization began to encroach on his operation,
Ecke Sr. moved the business south, to 40 arid acres in Encinitas.</TE>
<TE>   Ecke Jr. was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Encinitas. He
served with the Navy in World War II and the Korean War and dreamed
of becoming a Navy pilot, but his eyesight was not sharp enough.
After completing his military service, he enrolled at Ohio State
University and earned a degree in horticulture in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work for his father at Ecke Ranch, which had found
success selling its field-grown mother plants to greenhouse growers
across the country. The greenhouse growers would derive cuttings from
the plants and grow them to maturity for sale during the weeks
leading up to Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Ecke Jr. pushed his father to sell cuttings instead of mother
plants to growers. The advent of jet air freight made it possible for
the Eckes to quickly ship delicate cuttings to growers and allow them
to get mature plants to the market in a more timely manner. After
considerable debate, he convinced his father that the family business
needed to make this shift in order to survive.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Ecke Jr. took over the day-to-day operations of the ranch
and began to replace the fields with greenhouses, which allowed more
tightly controlled growing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The first major breakthrough came in 1965, when Ecke hybridizers
produced a variety of poinsettia with blooms that lasted more than a
week. Until then, the plant usually dropped its leaves within a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Ecke also started a breeding program in which hybridizers
deliberately exposed the plant to X-rays and chemicals to produce
variations. Today, the poinsettia can be found with double and triple
blooms and in hues as exotic as orange and purple.</TE>
<TE>   The plant is also much hardier now, lasting months instead of
days. This advancement is due largely to the staff at Ecke Ranch
under Paul Jr.'s leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a plant that easily dropped its leaves and ...
transformed it," said Cathey of the Horticultural Society. "People
can keep them until April or May. How many flowering plants do you
know that do that?"</TE>
<TE>   But Ecke's most profound contribution had little to do with
science.</TE>
<TE>   He recognized early on that women were his core customers. It
rankled him that the lavish holiday layouts in the leading women's
magazines of the early 1970s showed every symbol of the
season--Christmas trees, wreaths, candles, menorahs--but one:
poinsettias.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomed Plants Out of Season to Get Publicity</TE>
<TE>   "He went to the magazines and said, 'Hey, guys, how would you like
me to give you free poinsettias for your layouts?'" recalled his son,
Paul Ecke III. "Then he found out they do those layouts in July and
August, so he bloomed poinsettias out of season ... and they put them
in their layouts. It was a subliminal form of advertising."</TE>
<TE>   The invention of color television led to another brainstorm. Ecke
donated large displays of the potted plant to popular shows,
including the "Tonight Show," the "Dinah Shore Show" and Bob Hope
Christmas specials. "Johnny [Carson] would be sitting there during
the holiday season, and there would be this beautiful backdrop of
poinsettias," Ecke's son said. "This was all done with the intention
of stimulating demand for poinsettias and for flowers in general."</TE>
<TE>   By 1986, the poinsettia "gently pushed chrysanthemums aside to
become the No. 1 best-selling potted plant in the United States,"
according to the 1998 book "Poinsettias, the December Flower" by
Christine Anderson and Terry Tischer.</TE>
<TE>   The Ecke Ranch now has operations in Guatemala, where it raises
all of its poinsettia cuttings. Poinsettia propagation is centered at
the Encinitas ranch, which also houses a large research and
development division. It markets more than 60 varieties of poinsettia
as well as about 300 types of bedding plants, including petunias and
impatiens, under the Flower Fields brand.</TE>
<TE>   Ecke's leadership positions included presidency of the Los Angeles
Flower Market. In 2001, he received the American Horticultural
Society's highest honor, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Award. He also was a
major benefactor of the YMCA. His family donated land in Encinitas
for the Magdalena Ecke YMCA, named for Ecke's late mother.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his son, his survivors include his wife, Maureen;
daughters Sara Ecke May of Greensboro, N.C., and Lizbeth Ecke of
Encinitas; and seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Friday at the Magdalena
Ecke YMCA, 200 Saxony Road, Encinitas.</TE>
<TE>   Donations may be sent to the Paul Ecke Jr. Fellowship Fund, c/o
American Floral Endowment, 11 Glen-Ed Professional Park, Glen Carbon,
IL 62034, or to the Magdalena Ecke YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   Those charities were important to his father, Paul Ecke III said,
but the most meaningful tribute would be to "send flowers to somebody
you love. That would mean a lot to him. He hated the 'in lieu of
flowers' phrase in obituaries. He supported the flower business."</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Alleged Child Porn in Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A judge Wednesday ruled that some of the alleged child pornography
seized at the home of David Westerfield can be introduced as evidence
in his trial on charges of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield's attorney, Steven Feldman, had argued that the
pornographic images were so distasteful that they would unfairly bias
jurors against his client. The images were allegedly contained on
computer disks in Westerfield's garage.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek argued that the child pornography
was proof that Westerfield kidnapped the girl because he has
fantasies about sex with underage girls.</LD>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, is accused of
abducting Danielle van Dam from her home in the Sabre Springs
neighborhood and then dumping her body in a rural area 40 miles away.
Prosecutors contend that he suffocated the girl, knocking out her
teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Along with allowing the alleged child pornography as evidence,
Superior Court Judge William Mudd ruled that a misdemeanor charge of
possession of child pornography will not be dealt with in a separate
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd also ruled that defense attorneys can present evidence about
the lifestyle of Danielle's parents, Brenda and Damon van Dam, in an
effort to show that the couple often entertained strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said the evidence is relevant because it shows that others
besides Westerfield had access to the home. Westerfield lived two
doors from the Van Dams.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is set to begin Friday with questioning of prospective
jurors. A 20-page questionnaire with more than 100 questions has been
prepared for prospective jurors.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's nude, decomposing body was found Feb. 28, four weeks
after her disappearance. Westerfield was arrested Feb. 22 after
police allegedly found Danielle's blood, fingerprints and hair in his
recreational vehicle.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenagers were arrested Wednesday and another was sought in the
shooting death of an illegal cabdriver late Tuesday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack on the Harbor Freeway near the Exposition Boulevard
exit stemmed from a minor traffic collision earlier in the evening,
said Los Angeles Police Lt. Roger Deranian. The cabdriver, a man in
his 50s, and the other person involved in the accident apparently had
resolved the matter, Deranian said.</LD>
<LD>   But 19-year-olds David Rodriguez and Joel Argueta and a
17-year-old male followed the cabdriver and a woman passenger, police
said. They knew the person involved in the accident with the
cabdriver, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "The suspects saw this as an opportunity to rob the cab," Deranian
said. As the cab began to exit the northbound Harbor Freeway on
Exposition, the suspects' car drove alongside and opened fire, he
said. The man was taken to a local hospital, where he died.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the suspects left without robbing him or his
passenger. She was not hurt, Deranian said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD and California Highway Patrol officers soon swarmed the area,
searching for the suspects. Their car was found later at Grand Avenue
and 39th Street, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was arrested at his home early Wednesday. The
17-year-old was arrested at his home hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Police are searching for Argueta, Deranian said.</TE>
<TE>   "With witnesses willing to get involved, we were able to nail
things down pretty fast," Deranian said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information may call detectives at (323) 846-6556.</TE>

<HD>Mother and Son Indicted in '98 Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mother and son accused of killing a Granada Hills businessman and
dumping his body in a trash bin four years ago have been indicted in
Los Angeles County Superior Court on capital murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   Sante and Kenneth Kimes, already convicted and sentenced for
murdering a socialite in New York, were indicted by the Los Angeles
County Grand Jury on charges of killing David Kazdin, 63, on March
13, 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, alleges that the killing was
for financial gain and that Kenneth Kimes was the one who shot Kazdin
with a handgun.</LD>
<TE>   Both Sante Kimes, 67, and Kenneth Kimes, 27, pleaded not guilty to
the charges Wednesday in front of Judge David Wesley. The judge
ordered the Kimeses, who are being held in Los Angeles County Jail
without bail, to return to court June 26 for a pretrial hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury indictment alleges special circumstances, including
murder for financial gain and murder of a witness, that could carry
the death penalty. Prosecutors still have not decided whether to seek
the death penalty against the mother-and-son con artist team.</TE>
<TE>   The two were convicted in New York two years ago in the murder of
82-year-old Irene Silverman in a scheme to gain control of her Upper
East Side townhouse. Silverman's body was never found.</TE>
<TE>   The pair, who each received more than 120 years in prison in the
New York case, were extradited to Los Angeles last year to face
charges in Kazdin's death.</TE>
<TE>   Kazdin's body was found in 1998 in a trash bin near Los Angeles
International Airport. Prosecutors believe the Kimeses, who had known
Kazdin for 20 years, killed him after he discovered they had forged
his signature on a $280,000 loan against his house.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Eleanor Hunter presented evidence to grand
jurors last week. Prosecutors called six witnesses during the
proceedings, which lasted less than a day, said spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons. The witnesses included the Los Angeles Police Department
detective investigating the case and former friends of the Kimeses,
Shawn Little and Robert McCarren. The grand jury returned the
indictment May 9.</TE>
<TE>   By obtaining an indictment, prosecutors avoided a preliminary
hearing, a proceeding at which witnesses can be cross-examined by the
defense. Sante and Kenneth Kimes had already been charged in a
criminal complaint Aug. 18, 1999, and were scheduled to appear in
court May 30 to set a date for a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said prosecutors sought a grand jury indictment to speed
up the process. Kenneth Kimes was extradited in March 2001 and his
mother arrived three months later, but a preliminary hearing date had
not yet been set.</TE>
<TE>   "This case has been languishing now for four years," Gibbons said.
" ... The people want to go to trial. This will help expedite it."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Kimes' attorney, Regina Laughney, said complicated cases
usually take a long time to go to trial and that she is still
preparing her client's defense. Sante Kimes is representing herself.</TE>

<HD>Valley Letter Carriers Suffer Most Dog Bites</HD>
<DH>Injuries: Eighty-five reports in one-year period lead
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Letter carriers in the Van Nuys postal district lead the nation in
dog-bite injuries, according to the U.S. Postal Service.</LD>
<LD>   Between September 2000 and September of last year, letter carriers
reported 85 bites in the Van Nuys district, which includes Santa
Clarita and the San Fernando Valley. In the same period, postal
workers in the Los Angeles district reported 42 bites. Nationwide,
3,138 were reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley district's total was down from the 98 reported the
previous year, the postal service said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not that the dogs are meaner in the Valley. It's just that
you have warm weather and a lot of people," said Terri Bouffiou, a
postal service spokeswoman. "People have dogs. And dogs bite people."</TE>
<TE>   Mail carrier Jill Saman was bitten in February by a pit bull near
the front door of a home on her Granada Hills route.</TE>
<TE>   The bite to her left thigh required seven stitches and left a
three-inch scar, Saman said. She was assigned to desk work after the
incident and only recently returned to delivering mail, but only at
apartments and curbside mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   Saman said she began seeing a psychiatrist last month. Although
she likes dogs, she said they scare her.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I'm walking down the street and I see a dog, it kind of
freaks me out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials said they hope releasing the statistics will make
customers more careful with their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep the dogs contained in a fenced yard. Keep them leashed if
there isn't a fence. Or keep them in the house if a carrier
approaches the house," said Cathey Sinai, a safety analyst for the
postal service.</TE>

<HD>UC Nurses Plan to Strike Over Stalled Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at the University of California's six hospitals
announced late Wednesday that they will have a one-day strike May 29
to protest stalled negotiations, union officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The daylong action, the first in the medical system's history,
could be followed by an open-ended strike if progress is not made in
negotiations, California Nurses Assn. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not where we wanted to be," said Maxine Terk, a nurse in
the neonatal intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center in Westwood.
"It is very disappointing."</LD>
<TE>   Union officials said the strike could be averted if negotiations
with UC make progress.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials had said earlier that a strike might force them to
close trauma centers and transfer patients to prepare for a reduction
in staff. They declined to discuss their options in detail Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said that they plan to begin contacting county
health directors to discuss how to deliver care to patients when UC
nurses are on the picket lines. UC nurses also will be allowed to
cross picket lines in the event of a patient emergency.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses' contract expired April 30. Negotiations on a new pact
have been stalled on several key issues, particularly merit pay.</TE>

<HD>Council Backs Tax Vote for Parkland</HD>
<DH>Open space: Property owners in Santa Monica Mountains will
decide on special district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday backed a plan to increase
public parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains by taxing property
owners from Griffith Park to Topanga Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The final say on the proposal will come from the property owners
themselves as soon as next month.</LD>
<LD>   They will be asked by mail-in ballot whether each single-family
home should be taxed $40 a year to buy open space near their homes,
protect wildlife and clear brush for fire protection. Businesses
would pay about $120 per acre, and apartment building owners would be
assessed on a sliding scale.</LD>
<TE>   The tax would funnel about $2 million annually to the Mountains
Recreation and Conservation Authority, a regional park agency that
owns about 35,000 acres of wilderness in the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining open space in the mountains that is privately owned is
under constant development pressure, conservation authority officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Daniel, chairman of the board of the park agency, said he is
pleased that the tax district plan is moving ahead quickly with
little public opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many properties that could otherwise go to
single-family or multifamily development," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The park agency has drawn up a wish list of 50 to 60 parcels
totaling 2,500 to 3,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's 10-1 vote Wednesday, with Councilman Nate
Holden opposed, allows the park agency to create a special tax
district straddling the Santa Monicas, if the mountain-area property
owners approve it on a simple-majority vote. The district would
stretch from Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the west to the Golden State
Freeway on the east, and from Ventura Boulevard on the north to
Sunset Boulevard on the south.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we've tried this approach, where people
being assessed will feel the effects in their immediate area," Daniel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ballots could be in the mail by mid-June. The number of households
in the proposed tax area is between 40,000 and 50,000, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other areas of California, including Marin and Santa Clara
counties, have used special tax districts to preserve open space,
park agency officials said.</TE>

<HD>Beach Pollution Source Eludes Scientists Despite Careful
Study</HD>
<DH>Environment: Orange County sanitation officials can't blame
outfall pipes for bacteria that has closed beaches. Academic says his
theory may still be valid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON, JANET WILSON and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending $5 million on an elaborate study, the Orange County
Sanitation District said Wednesday it is no closer to pinpointing
what caused the summer-long closure of the Huntington Beach coastline
in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The study, conducted by consultants hired by the district, found
no substantial evidence that an offshore sewage plume caused the
beach pollution. But for the first time the district said it could
not rule the plume out as one of the possible causes.</LD>
<LD>   The study measured thousands of water samples to test a UC Irvine
professor's theory that bacteria-laced waste water pumped four miles
out to sea was finding its way back to shore.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not yet found a connection between coastal ocean
processes and bacterial contamination on the beaches," said Marlene
Noble, one of the scientists who conducted the study.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Murphy, a spokeswoman for the sanitation district, added:
"They are not ruling it out .... [but] the scientists cannot link the
treated waste water to the shoreline contamination."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it's possible that the beach closure could have
been caused by several factors coming together at one time, including
polluted runoff, leaking restroom sewers that have since been fixed,
old sewers at a mobile home park and waste from seagulls.</TE>
<TE>   "The contamination problem ... is complex and made up of multiple
sources that contribute to the problem," said Kelly Christensen,
principal environmental specialist for the sanitation district.</TE>
<TE>   For environmentalists, the agency's disclosure left many questions
unanswered. A written report won't be ready until October, and the
data collected by scientists weren't immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for good science, and once this has been
read and digested, we'll see how good the science is," said
Christopher Evans, U.S. executive director of Surfrider Foundation,
which has monitored the Huntington Beach closures. "The thing that
looms over this is that it's an Orange County Sanitation District
study. Everyone sees the potential conflict there."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Grant, the UC Irvine scientist who first suggested a link
between the sewage discharge and the beach pollution, said Wednesday
he didn't doubt the district's findings. But he said its carefully
worded conclusion--that there was no "substantial" evidence--leaves
open the possibility that his hypothesis is still valid.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying they cannot put the plume in the surf zone but
can't rule it out," Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by researchers from USC, the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography and the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School
under guidance by the U.S. Geological Survey and sanitation district
scientists. Scientists from UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science
Institute and the University of Hawaii reviewed the results and
presented their findings at a meeting of the district's board of
directors Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The results leave the mystery as to what caused the high bacteria
counts that forced health officials to close miles of Huntington
Beach in 1999 during the height of tourist season. Every summer
since, bacteria counts have spiked. A portion of the beach was closed
again for a month this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the million-dollar question that I don't think anybody in
this county knows the answer to," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials hope their study will allow the
agency to keep a waiver to the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver, which is up for renewal next year, allows the agency
to treat half of the waste water it pumps into the ocean at levels
less than those adopted by most of the nation's 16,000 sanitation
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups and three coastal cities, including
Huntington Beach, oppose extending the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials say treating all of its outflow to
the highest levels--by using microorganisms to eliminate bacteria and
viruses--would cost more than $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also at stake is Huntington Beach's economic lifeblood. The city's
8.5 miles of beach attracts 10 million people a year. The recent
closures due to pollution have sullied Surf City's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   After 1999's beach shutdown, authorities looked at and discarded
possible causes for the high bacteria levels, including urban runoff
from Talbert Marsh and the Santa Ana River.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, UC Irvine's Grant suggested that the sanitation
district's offshore plume was partially to blame. He theorized that
partially treated sewage from showers, sinks and toilets was being
drawn back to the beach by tides, underwater waves and the local AES
power plant's ocean-fed cooling system.</TE>
<TE>   "A really important question is whether this study tests the exact
hypothesis," Surfrider's Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said the agency's study involved 150 researchers and
volunteers and was "the single largest sampling event to occur in
this area."</TE>

<CX>   Treated sewage--A story in Thursday's California section incorrectly
said the Orange County Sanitation District has sought an extension of
a waiver that allows the agency to send partially treated sewage
through an ocean outfall. District officials have said a new
$400-million plant could be needed if the waiver isn't renewed, but
the district has not yet decided whether to seek one.</CX>

<HD>Prison Guards' Labor Pact to Be Examined</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Polanco, concerned about costs of the
contract, will call hearings. The union is a big Davis contributor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Senate Majority Leader Richard Polanco said Wednesday he'll convene
legislative hearings on the lucrative labor pact that Gov. Gray Davis
signed with the state prison guards union, one of Davis' largest
campaign contributors.</LD>
<LD>   Newly emerging details of the labor agreement indicate that in
addition to a salary increase of about one-third by 2006, the guards
will receive a wealth of benefits, including the right to retire at
age 50 and receive as much as 90% of their latest salary.</LD>
<LD>   Polanco (D-Los Angeles) said the contract cannot be rescinded, but
he said he thinks lawmakers should scrutinize the details and perhaps
change aspects of it as part of budget negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. is one of Davis'
most generous political benefactors. It contributed $251,000 to Davis
in March, two months after he signed the labor deal.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco said Wednesday that although the Legislature
overwhelmingly ratified the agreement in January, details were not
available at the time and are only now becoming public.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, only a handful of officials and others have seen
what are essentially bootleg copies of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad thing is we didn't have this information when the
Legislature ratified the agreement," Polanco said. "It is a horrible
process to have to vote to ratify and not have the full analysis."</TE>
<TE>   The contract, nearly 400 pages long, grants California prison
guards pay parity with the California Highway Patrol and five major
police departments, including Los Angeles Police and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's departments. A confidential analysis by the union
estimates that by 2006, veteran correctional officers will be paid
$73,428 a year--and possibly more. That's nearly 34% more than their
current wage, and would cost taxpayers roughly $700 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Another significant provision guarantees that beginning in 2006,
the state's 26,000 correctional officers will be entitled to retire
at age 50 and receive as much as 90% of their pay in lifetime
pensions. An analysis by the California Public Employees Retirement
System placed the price tag at $22.5 million a year in today's
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Besides pay, the contract gives the union more say over working
conditions, and limits wardens' ability to oversee abuse by officers
of sick leave and overtime, two issues that have added to the
California Department of Corrections' current $277-million cost
overrun.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' chief political strategist, Garry South, dismissed the
notion of a back-room deal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not some sweetheart deal cut in the dead of night," South
said. He noted that lawmakers were nearly unanimous in their support
and that the state long has aimed at increasing the status of prison
guards.</TE>
<TE>   Union President Don Novey could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, who heads a budget subcommittee that oversees the prison
system, plans to delve into the contract in a hearing Friday, and
hopes to blunt some of the contract's language through the budget
process. Given the governor's line-item veto authority, however,
Davis will have final say over any budget language dealing with
corrections.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very powerful, influential union," Polanco said.
"You can't blame Novey. But you can blame the administration and the
Legislature for allowing it."</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials defended the contract, contending
that prison workers have hard jobs. Several requirements imposed by
past administrations, aimed at limiting state costs, were eliminated
because administration officials agreed with union negotiators that
they were demeaning.</TE>
<TE>   "I stand behind this contract," said Mary Morgenstern, Davis'
director of the Department of Personnel Administration. "I will admit
to trying to be empathetic, to trying to give them decent working
conditions, in part because of the belief that felons will be treated
more fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Based on a variety of sources and analysis, several provisions in
the contract stood out:</TE>
<TE>   * The state agreed to eliminate a requirement that officers take
physical fitness tests to collect extra pay for being fit. Officers
viewed the so-called "Jumping for Bucks" test as demeaning. Instead
of taking agility, strength or endurance tests, officers now can have
a doctor perform a physical exam and provide a note vouching that
they are fit, Morgenstern said.</TE>
<TE>   * Physical fitness pay will double to $130 per month for veteran
officers. Newly hired officers will be entitled to $65 per month in
fitness pay. Assuming that 26,000 members receive the benefit, the
cost could be $20 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   * The state will place $5 million into a "Work and Family Fund,"
to study policies related to "child care, elder care, family leave,
flexibility in the workplace and a variety of other family-friendly
programs and policies." Union and management representatives will
administer the program.</TE>
<TE>   * The Department of Corrections, which has a 12% vacancy rate,
will hire enough officers to lower the vacancy rate to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   In his revised budget released earlier this week, Davis proposed
giving the Department of Corrections an additional $204 million,
pushing the department's annual budget to $5 billion. Department
officials recently told lawmakers that the department had incurred
$277 million in unexpected costs, even though the inmate population
has declined to 156,000 from a high of 162,000.</TE>

<HD>Ray Stricklyn, 73; Actor and Publicist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Stricklyn, an actor who scored his greatest triumph in the
mid-1980s after abandoning his once promising acting career a decade
earlier and becoming a highly respected Hollywood publicist, has
died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Stricklyn, whose one-man show as Tennessee Williams earned him
critical praise and a new lease on his former career, died Tuesday at
his home in Los Angeles after a long battle with chronic emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   "Confessions of a Nightingale," based on interviews with Williams
by Charlotte Chandler and C. Robert Jennings, opened at the Beverly
Hills Playhouse in January 1985. Stricklyn portrayed the legendary
playwright in his declining years--a time when Williams' talent had
faded but his outsized personality remained in full bloom.</LD>
<TE>   When his one-man show debuted, Stricklyn was representing Bette
Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, Lynn Redgrave and other stars as co-director
of publicity for the West Coast office of John Springer Associates,
the prestigious Manhattan-based public relations firm. But what had
been intended as a four-weekend performance ran for a year and earned
Stricklyn best actor awards from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle
and L.A. Weekly, among others. Stricklyn quit his day job.</TE>
<TE>   "Confessions of a Nightingale" opened off-Broadway in New York in
1986, earning a laudatory review from New York magazine critic John
Simon, who wrote: "All those small mannerisms, tics, idiosyncratic
intonations, hesitancies, shifts of mood are fraught with
authenticity."</TE>
<TE>   Stricklyn toured with his one-man show for the next decade, with
engagements as far-flung as Scotland and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was first working on portraying Williams, I didn't have
any idea of doing much with it," he told the Chicago Tribune in 1987.
"But he certainly brought me back to life and, in a way, I have done
the same for him."</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Houston, Stricklyn became enchanted with acting
in kindergarten when he portrayed Little Boy Blue in a school
pageant. He pursued dramatics throughout school.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to New York in 1950 and made his Broadway debut two years
later, playing the juvenile lead in Moss Hart's "The Climate of
Eden." His performance earned him a Daniel Blum Theater World Award
as the season's most promising young actor.</TE>
<TE>   Moving to Hollywood in 1955, he made his film debut as a
"cracked-up" Marine in George Seaton's "The Proud and the Profane."</TE>
<TE>   Among other early roles, he played Bette Davis and Ernest
Borgnine's son in "The Catered Affair" and Gary Cooper and Geraldine
Fitzgerald's son in "Ten North Frederick," which earned him a Golden
Globe nomination as most promising new actor of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood gossip columnist Louella Parsons predicted that the
young contract player for 20th Century Fox "could be the next
Montgomery Clift."</TE>
<TE>   But by the early 1960s, the career of the young actor with the
boyish good looks began to founder.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 27 and still looked 16, but there was a whole new crop of
boys coming up who really were that age," he told The Times in 1984.
"Before, I'd thought my career was going straight up. So like a lot
of foolish young actors, I started living beyond my means. I bought
expensive cars, got into debt. Once you think you're going to be a
star, then you're not--it's a rude awakening."</TE>
<TE>   Stage and film work had virtually dried up for Stricklyn by 1973,
when publicist John Springer asked him to head up his West Coast
office.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Stricklyn said, "I basically shut myself off from
that old life--although I missed the performing and needed it
terribly."</TE>
<TE>   His self-imposed exile from acting ended in 1982, when he began
appearing in local stage productions.</TE>
<TE>   The by then mature Stricklyn, his boyish face lined and his hair
gray, gave a moving performance as Mr. Nightingale, a dying
homosexual living in a seedy New Orleans boardinghouse, in Tennessee
Williams' "Vieux Carre" at the Beverly Hills Playhouse in 1983. His
performance earned him best actor awards from the Los Angeles Drama
Critics Circle, L.A. Weekly and Daily Variety.</TE>
<TE>   Portraying Williams' alter ego in "Vieux Carre" served as a
prelude for "Confessions of a Nightingale."</TE>
<TE>   When not touring as Williams, Stricklyn did guest shots in
"Cheers," "The Nanny," "Seinfeld," "Days of Our Lives" and other
television shows.</TE>
<TE>   After falling ill with emphysema in 1997, he began writing his
autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   Published in 1999, "Angels &amp; Demons: One Actor's Hollywood
Journey" is a candid and witty account of a man who, Stricklyn wrote,
"might qualify as one who has had his 15 minutes in the limelight;
perhaps even 20."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his sister, Mary Ann, and his longtime
companion, Los Angeles stage director David Galligan.</TE>

<PH>THE STATE BUDGET</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Local Governments Count Their Losses--and Blessings</HD>
<DH>Finances: They take a hit from Davis' cuts, but not as bad
as they feared. Three Orange County cities had even talked about
disincorporating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF and TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, city and county officials throughout the state have
claimed that the governor would balance his difficult budget at the
expense of local government. On Tuesday, they received a welcome
surprise: the growing budget shortfall did not disproportionately
fall on city and county budgets.</LD>
<LD>   State officials estimated that cuts and funding deferrals would
result in $1 billion less for counties during the next fiscal year.
That means deep cuts for services to the poor, at-risk youth,
libraries and the counties' ability to fund the staff that manage
them.</LD>
<LD>   But still, officials on both sides said it could have been worse.</LD>
<TE>   Before Gov. Gray Davis announced his revised budget plan Tuesday,
some newer cities in Orange County were so nervous about the local
impact that they talked about disincorporating. That talk ended with
the news that they will continue to receive funds from vehicle
registration fees.</TE>
<TE>   News that the governor isn't proposing taking away their share of
vehicle license fees left officials in Orange County's three youngest
cities--Aliso Viejo, Laguna Woods and Rancho Santa Margarita--feeling
cautiously optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you use to build your whole fiscal analysis for
incorporation," said Carmen Vali, mayor of Aliso Viejo, a city of
45,000.</TE>
<TE>   About $4 million of Aliso Viejo's $10-million budget next year is
expected to come from vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the governor for fulfilling his promise not to balance
his budget on the backs of local government," said Raechelle Kline,
spokeswoman for the League of California Cities. "But we are still
going to remain diligent in what he does next."</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles was still figuring out what its loss may
be, but Ellen Sandt, assistant city administrative officer, said the
city may lose up to $30 million of redevelopment money and $12
million designated to reimburse the city for state mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Though local agencies had expected worse, they warned that
residents still would feel the cuts. Los Angeles County alone stands
to lose an additional $150 million, said county Chief Administrative
Officer David Janssen.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts "are not especially visible, because they involve
administrative costs," he told the Board of Supervisors. "In effect,
counties will be asked to do the same or more than they are doing
now, but with less funding and personnel to deliver services."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that large cuts in administrative budgets mean the
county no longer has all the money it needs to manage Medi-Cal,
foster care and food stamps. People needing such services will still
get them, but might see longer lines and other difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Many departments were just beginning Wednesday to digest what
Davis' additional cuts meant.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Huston, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike
Antonovich, spent part of her day counseling the many community
groups that, after years of lobbying, received $36 million in state
grants for the first time this year for gang intervention,
self-esteem, at-risk youth and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   That money is gone under Davis' latest cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "This took years to put into place, and these organizations had
assurances that it would not be a one-time deal," Huston said. "For
that money to go away is unconscionable."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly hard-hit is the county library system, which already
faced a $1.1-million cut from its $80-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   County Librarian Margaret Donnellan Todd and aides gathered
Wednesday to hear that they'll lose another $1.2 million. The
county's libraries already were expecting to drastically reduce hours
and may have to close some branches.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Cynthia P. Coad, who heads the Board of
Supervisors, and County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher joined
counterparts from the state's 10 largest counties in meetings
Wednesday with Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson to discuss the budget's
effects.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors insisted this week that they oppose tax
increases at the state or local level to balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has said that an increase in the tobacco tax and vehicle
registration fees is necessary to balance the state's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County receives the smallest share statewide of local
property taxes paid, only 6 cents for every dollar sent to
Sacramento, making cuts in state funding even more crucial. Attempts
to increase the county's share have failed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a donor county, and we're destined to stay that way," said
Gary Burton, the county's assistant chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders in the three communities--all of which incorporated
within the last three years--say they aren't out of the woods yet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's talking about increasing fees to consumers, so I don't know
where that's going to go in the Legislature," said Laguna Woods City
Manager Leslie Keane. "And if the economy doesn't improve, we might
find ourselves back in this same situation next year."</TE>
<TE>   That money is perhaps most important to Laguna Woods, where the
fees cover more than half of the city's budget--about $2.5 million of
its $4.2-million spending plan for next year. If that were to go,
city officials had worried that the community of 20,000 residents
would have to disband as cities and return to county rule. The city
wouldn't have the sales tax base to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   That threat wasn't as strong in the 44,000-population town of
Rancho Santa Margarita, where vehicle license fees make up a little
more than a third of the city's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't mean disincorporating, but ... losing $1.5million or
$2million would negatively affect every level of city services," said
Jim Hart, Rancho Santa Margarita's city manager.</TE>

<HD>Vow of Reform by Arafat Is Doubted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Responding to Palestinian critics who say his autocratic rule has led
his people to disaster, Yasser Arafat engaged in rare public
self-criticism Wednesday, acknowledging to his skeptical parliament
that he has made mistakes and promising government reform and early
elections.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm calling for a reevaluation of all our administrative and
ministerial bodies, the security apparatuses, after there have been
signs of mismanagement here and there that are impossible to conceal
from public opinion," Arafat said in a speech to a session of the
Palestinian Legislative Council.</LD>
<LD>   "We have all made efforts to build and to do," the Palestinian
Authority president said. "We may have made mistakes or caused damage
... in one realm of responsibility or another, but we have guarded
security and our national goals."</LD>
<TE>   In a sign of growing public discontent with his leadership, Arafat
got a chilly reception from the lawmakers. Several complained after
the speech that he offered neither a date for elections nor specifics
on how to remake a government widely viewed as corrupt and
incompetent. The only balloting for parliament and president was held
in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "He speaks in general about reforms. We need decisions. We need a
new government to implement them, and we need time to see if the
president will implement his promises," said Nabil Amr, who resigned
as the minister for parliamentary affairs to protest the Palestinian
government's response to Israel's recent five-week-long invasion of
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Amr said Arafat should immediately dismiss his Cabinet, composed
largely of officials from the president's Palestine Liberation
Organization who lived in exile for years before returning to the
West Bank and Gaza Strip after the 1993 Oslo peace accords were
signed.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a Cabinet of technocrats" to handle the daunting task of
rebuilding infrastructure destroyed during Israel's operation, Amr
said. "We need to organize the security forces to make them more
professional, and we need to support the judiciary. We need real
reform, and we must start today."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat defended his aides and Cabinet ministers during his speech,
saying Palestinians were wrong to criticize them for cutting deals
that ended the Israeli army's sieges of his Ramallah headquarters and
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   "Put it all on my shoulders. I can handle it," he said in a
departure from his prepared text. Legislators should remember, he
said, "there is no movement in which mistakes are not found."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement and many other
Palestinians have criticized him and his aides for agreeing, as a
condition for ending the sieges, to exile or imprison fighters wanted
by Israel. Arafat also has come under fire for failing to mount a
defense against Israel's invasion of the West Bank and failing to
create a social safety net for Palestinians since their uprising
erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "After the tanks have come into our towns, people want clear
statements," said Ahmad Deik, a Fatah leader and member of parliament
who recently has written newspaper articles in favor of reform. "The
important thing for us is to know when we can build a modern
Palestinian political system."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's speech came the day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon told the Israeli parliament that peace with the Palestinians
would be possible only after broad reforms were made in the
Palestinian government, security forces and society.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Sharon dismissed Arafat's talk of reform.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Palestinians really want to move on the road to peace,
they should forget the speech their leader made today inciting people
for war," said Raanan Gissin, noting that Arafat failed to explicitly
order an end to all attacks. "It's not enough to say you're against
it. We need action."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure has been mounting on Arafat, since he emerged from
Israel's siege of his Ramallah headquarters, to rein in militias,
reorganize his various security forces and end government corruption.
The European Union, a key financial backer of the Palestinian
Authority, is making new aid contingent upon greater fiscal
accountability and other reforms. President Bush has also called for
changes.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the White House on Wednesday hailed Arafat's words,
calling them "positive." But Press Secretary Ari Fleischer cautioned
that Bush "will wait to see whether or not Yasser Arafat and others
in the Palestinian Authority actually take actions that lead to a
better life for the Palestinian people and actions that lead to a
region that can live in more stability and security."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat delivered his address on Naqba Day, which marks Israel's
declaration of independence in 1948. Palestinians refer to that event
as the naqba, or catastrophe, and consider it the beginning of their
exile from their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's critics have said that Israel's invasion of the West
Bank, launched March 29 in response to a wave of suicide bombings, is
the new naqba. Across the West Bank, the damage inflicted during the
massive military operation is still everywhere in evidence. A group
of donor nations and relief agencies released a report Wednesday that
put the cost of the physical damage at $361 million, with indirect
costs at several times that amount.</TE>
<TE>   The members of parliament who gathered to listen to Arafat on
Wednesday had to do so in a reception hall of the Education Ministry
because their legislative building next door was damaged during the
Israeli incursion last month.</TE>
<TE>   In another sign of the times, lawmakers from the Gaza Strip could
only gather there and watch the speech on a video screen because
their area is sealed off by the Israeli army. Most legislators from
the northern West Bank also could not attend because the army
maintains sieges around some towns.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Mark Magnier in Jerusalem and Edwin Chen in
Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fox Vows to Repay Mexican Water Debt to U.S.</HD>
<DH>Irrigation: The issue, disputed for years, poses a
financial burden for Texas farmers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Seeking to quell a lingering and complex dispute, President Vicente
Fox promised Wednesday to pay off a huge Mexican water debt to the
United States that is causing economic hardship among Texas farmers.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement issued from Europe, where he is traveling on state
business, Fox said he would announce in two weeks a water
conservation plan and a schedule for his nation to reimburse its
neighbor about 1.5 million acre-feet of water. Fox said he and
President Bush discussed the issue Tuesday by telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Fox promised "to comply completely with Mexico's international
obligations, reducing the deficit of deliveries to the United States
and guaranteeing at the same time supplies to border populations and
attention to the interests of Mexican farmers," the statement said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. government asserts that Mexicans have not lived up to a
1944 treaty that calls for them to turn over 350,000 acre-feet of
water a year where six Mexican tributaries flow into the Rio Grande.
Both the Mexican and U.S. sides of the binational International
Boundary and Water Commission agree that there is a huge water
deficit owed to the Americans, although the quantity has not been
officially fixed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   An acre-foot refers to the amount of irrigation water it takes to
cover an acre of land to a depth of a foot. The amount owed by Mexico
is equivalent to more than 480 billion gallons of water.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the water that Mexicans deliver to the United
States is measured and stored at two southern Texas reservoirs: the
Amistad near the town of Del Rio and the Falcon about 50 miles south
of Laredo. Both are at low levels, with Amistad at 38% of capacity
and Falcon at 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the willingness of President Fox and the Mexican
government to address the water problem," said Sally Spener,
spokeswoman for the El Paso-based U.S. section of the International
Boundary and Water Commission. "We await with interest the details of
the proposal."</TE>
<TE>   "The key question is what Fox means by compliance," said a U.S.
official who asked not to be identified. "How much water when?"</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's inability to supply the water it owes is due to poor or
nonexistent waste-water recovery in watershed areas of Mexican border
states and explosive population growth on both sides of the border,
which has put pressure on demand, said Tomas Martinez Saldana, a
water specialist at the College of Postgraduates near Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem is that northern Mexico and southern Texas
have lived through drought for the better part of a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of the frontier is one of water disputes. But since
the 1944 treaty was signed, population in the Rio Grande basin has
grown from 200,000 to 20 million, not to mention the industrial
growth, and that has meant conflicts," said Martinez, who added that
the two countries should rewrite the water treaty.</TE>
<TE>   With crop yields down and farm unemployment rising, southern Texas
farmers can't wait for relief. They are especially furious over a new
Texas A&amp;M University study showing that crops in Mexico's Tamaulipas
state are flourishing while theirs are wilting, said Michael Patrick,
an economics professor at the university's Laredo satellite campus.</TE>
<TE>   "For Fox to make this effective he'll have to monitor every
Mexican farmer, and that's like the U.S. Border Patrol trying to
catch everyone coming across the border," he said. "It can't be
done."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government sees waste-water recycling systems as its
best hope for saving the water to work down the deficit. But it
cannot afford the expensive systems and has asked the U.S. for
financial help.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Mexican Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that
Fox asked Bush at a March summit in the northern Mexican city of
Monterrey for $500 million in assistance to build more than 30
waste-water projects in four Mexican border states.</TE>
<TE>   Neither government has issued a public statement about that
request, and nothing concrete was announced after the summit.</TE>
<TE>   The Rio Grande is not the only bilateral water dispute. Farmers in
the Mexicali Valley are upset about a U.S. plan to reline the
All-American Canal from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley,
saying it would deprive them of water seepage they use to irrigate
their crops.</TE>

<HD>Pro-West Putin Snubs His Public</HD>
<DH>Russia: Despite a Cold War chill at home, the president is
banking on his efforts to secure Moscow's standing as a global
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Ordinary Russians and much of the country's top military and
political echelon regard the United States as an arrogant, aggressive
power and remain deeply suspicious of NATO, an outlook shaped during
the Cold War and little changed since, many analysts here say.</LD>
<LD>   Yet President Vladimir V. Putin this week took two bold strokes
designed to move his nation closer to the West. As he awaits the
arrival of President Bush next week for a summit, Putin has agreed to
a tighter relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and to a two-thirds reduction in the two nations' offensive nuclear
warheads.</LD>
<LD>   What makes Putin pursue an aggressively pro-Western policy at a
time when most of his people do not want anything of the kind?
Political experts here say Putin is banking on the general
disinterest toward the outside world now, as most Russians'
priorities are fixed instead on domestic questions and their own
pocketbooks.</LD>
<TE>   Putin hopes that his friendly overtures to the West will lead to
concrete financial and strategic benefits that will rebuild Russia in
the long run and firmly secure its place among the world's most
powerful and respected states.</TE>
<TE>   "His ratings among the Russians do not really depend that much on
his foreign policies," observed Dmitri V. Trenin of the Carnegie
Moscow Center think tank. "His popularity depends more on the skill
of implementing economic reforms and making people's lives better."</TE>
<TE>   It is true that some political opponents are trying to capitalize
on Putin's alleged softness toward the West.</TE>
<TE>   "An unprecedented surrender of Russia's national interests,"
Communist Party chief Gennady A. Zyuganov thundered Wednesday at a
news conference here, referring to the arms control agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov, anticipating the criticism,
went out of his way to argue that Russia had not sacrificed its
national interests in the accord, which is to be signed when Bush
comes to Moscow. Ivanov called the pact "pragmatic and realistic."</TE>
<TE>   But such attacks on Putin from the left, represented by the
Communists, or from the right, including the many
nationalistic-minded members of parliament, are not likely to reach a
critical level for the popular president any time soon, said Ivan
Safranchuk of Moscow's Center for Defense Information.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Putin can parry these attacks quite easily," Safranchuk
said, "in part by adopting some of the nationalists' own language."</TE>
<TE>   According to Safranchuk, Putin's strategy will be to try not to
draw too much attention domestically to his pro-Western steps. As
long as the president moves quietly, the political cost of his
actions will be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   And the gains for Russia's standing in the world from Putin's
policies could be immense.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia has to prove to the international community why Russia is
still important," Safranchuk said. "Russia has to state why Russia is
Russia, and not merely Cote d'Ivoire with weapons."</TE>
<TE>   By drawing the U.S. into arms treaties and by proving that Russia
can influence U.S. policies, he said, Moscow proves its weight in the
world. Developing countries will get the following message about
Russia: "If you have problems, call our toll-free international
number," Safranchuk said.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important, he said, is the message sent out to U.S.
allies in Europe and elsewhere: "Look, we are now friends with the
United States. That is why you have all rights to cooperate with us."</TE>
<TE>   So for Putin, Safranchuk concluded, closer "Russian-U.S. relations
are not the goal but the tool. It is an instrument of access to U.S.
allies," with whom Russia hopes to wield influence and increase
commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition From Elites</TE>
<TE>   But Alexei G. Arbatov, a deputy from the liberal faction Yabloko
in the Duma, or lower house of parliament, is not so sure that Putin
will be able to maintain his pro-Western stance in the face of
opposition from political elites.</TE>
<TE>   Putin might pay a price in popularity for going so directly
against the mood of anti-Western opinion, Arbatov said.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreign policy is a subject of interest to a minority of the
people and influenced by a minority," Arbatov said. "Putin's policies
since Sept. 11 have created greater mistrust and counterpressure for
change among this minority."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Arbatov said, there is little reason to believe that the
U.S. is going to reciprocate for Russia's moves toward the West. In
the agreement this week to set up the new joint Russia-NATO council,
for instance, it is still uncertain what questions will be referred
to this body and whether it will just be a "talking shop" while
important decisions are made elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In the sphere of arms control, there is little clarity on how
quickly the United States will pull warheads out of service and how
many will be destroyed rather than simply stored. And Russian elites
are still irked about the U.S. decision to pull out of the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and about plans to expand NATO this year
by asking the former Soviet Baltic states to join.</TE>
<TE>   Those Russians interested in foreign affairs "believe the West is
not responding accordingly to all of Russia's efforts to cooperate,"
Arbatov said.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions of the West</TE>
<TE>   The conclusion that Russians remain suspicious of the West was
partly borne out Wednesday in a report by the Public Opinion
Foundation, which surveyed 1,500 respondents from 100 locations
nationwide about attitudes toward NATO. The poll found that 52% of
respondents considered the alliance still a security threat to
Russia, while only 24% did not.</TE>
<TE>   But Trenin is among analysts who believe that Putin's position is
so unassailable that he can weather any anti-Western backlash. "Since
there is no real opposition to President Putin in Russia today," he
said, "it is very unlikely that this criticism will mean anything."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Carter Trip Puts Cuba Back on Washington's Radar Screen</HD>
<DH>Policy: As some lawmakers renew calls for easing sanctions,
Bush's hard-line stance is seen as favoring his brother's reelection
bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Former President Carter's visit to Havana reverberated
through Washington on Wednesday, rejuvenating a congressional drive
to ease the U.S. trade embargo on the island nation while forcing the
White House to explain why President Bush favors commerce with
Communist China but not Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   In a long-planned address on Cuba scheduled for Monday in Miami,
however, Bush is expected to announce an even-tougher policy that
might include additional trade sanctions and further restrictions on
travel to the island, as well as increased aid to Cuban dissidents.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has shown little interest in improving U.S. relations with
President Fidel Castro's Communist government, as he stressed in his
initial response this week to Carter's trip. "I haven't changed my
foreign policy," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   Though the White House says this hard-line stance is not motivated
by domestic politics, one beneficiary should be the president's
brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The president's Monday speech is expected to further energize much
of the Cuban American community in Florida in behalf of the governor,
who is seeking reelection this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans have rightly or wrongly tied [U.S. policy toward
Cuba] to Gov. Bush's reelection," said Terry McCoy, a professor of
Latin American Studies at the University of Florida in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   In the longer term, fervent Cuban American support for President
Bush's policy would benefit his own reelection chances in the
battleground state.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House on Wednesday, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was
bombarded with questions about the different economic approaches
toward China and Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes that trade with Cuba ends up giving the
government more resources to repress its people," Fleischer said.
"History has shown that when Cuba receives the benefits of trade from
other nations, those benefits are not passed on to the Cuban people,
unlike China, where the trade benefits are indeed passed on to the
people of China."</TE>
<TE>   Among those calling for an easing of sanctions was Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). Emerging from the West Wing after a
breakfast meeting with Bush, Daschle argued that trade with Cuba
could lead to democratic reforms there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reached out to countries around the world with similar
governments," Daschle said. "We can democratize Cuba with greater
trade and greater outreach."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, a bipartisan coalition of the Cuba Working Group,
made up of farm-state lawmakers and free-trade advocates, urged Bush
to allow unfettered sale of food and medicine and to end the travel
restrictions that prevent ordinary U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The House has voted twice in recent years to end the travel ban,
but the measure progressed no further.</TE>
<TE>   Congress two years ago approved legislation to allow the sale of
food and medicine to Cuba. But the measure imposes tight restrictions
that have severely limited such shipments. The first shipment of
food--including 55 million pounds of corn--arrived only last
December.</TE>
<TE>   In Havana, meanwhile, Carter met with religious leaders, teachers
and local government officials in the countryside before attending a
state dinner in his honor at Castro's presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban newspapers--all government-owned--played up Carter's appeal
Tuesday for an end to the embargo and the opening of a new era of
closer U.S.-Cuban relations. He issued that call in a speech on
state-run television--the first time that Castro's regime allowed a
present or former U.S. president to freely address Cubans.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials in Havana praised Carter's address and its
potential impact on the growth of democracy in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just a little step. It was an enormous stride," said
Vicki Huddleston, who heads the U.S. Interests Section in the Cuban
capital, the diplomatic mission Carter reopened during his
presidential term.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it mean that tomorrow change will come? No. But does it mean
change will continue apace and even speed up? Yes, I think it will."</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Monday is scheduled to deliver essentially the same speech
twice--once before leaving Washington and then again in Miami--as
part of the observance of Cuban Independence Day. He will also speak
at a fund-raiser for his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Bush's reelection bid is one of this year's most closely
watched races. Democrats and African American leaders, upset over the
disputed 2000 presidential election in Florida, have been organizing
voter registration drives throughout the state in their campaign to
defeat Gov. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm projecting that we're going to have an election year that
looks more like a presidential year--in terms of turnout," said Susan
A. McManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida
in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Cuban American community typically votes overwhelmingly
Republican. Some political experts note, however, that the
community's impact on Florida politics is waning, in part because
non-Cuban Latinos now outnumber Cuban Latinos in the state.</TE>
<TE>   However, some analysts say the spotlight President Bush will put
on U.S.-Cuba relations with his Monday speech is sure to help his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Bushes can bat this one out of the park by condemning Cuban
communism and Castro, thereby thrilling most Cuban Americans and
tying them even more closely to the Republican Party," said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato. "A
president should wish that all decisions were so obvious and
politically rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Nick Anderson in Washington, Mark Fineman in
Havana and Anna M. Virtue in Miami contributed to this report.</TE>

<DH>Music: Despite legal battles, successors to Napster are a
hit with consumers, advertisers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music industry arch-nemesis Napster Inc. is dying for lack of cash,
but a new generation of companies that also allow legions of home
pirates to swap music is thriving in its aftermath.</LD>
<LD>   Morpheus, Kazaa, Grokster and other networks that allow users to
trade music files have done something Napster never did: convert a
huge following of users into a cash-producing enterprise. Night or
day, more than 2.6 million computers are connected to the new
networks.</LD>
<LD>   Advertisers are flocking to support the new networks and
underwrite their growth, though Hollywood studios, record labels and
music publishers say they're a global swap meet for pirates.</LD>
<TE>   The new systems--known as peer-to-peer file-sharing networks--can
deliver massive amounts of advertising to audiences that rival
network television's. Advertisers using the new networks range from
online casinos and direct marketers to such companies as AT&amp;T
Wireless and Orbitz, the online ticket agency owned by major
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Even Columbia House DVD Club, a venture co-owned by Sony Corp. and
AOL Time Warner Inc., advertised on Morpheus--despite the fact that
both companies are suing the service for copyright infringement.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be associated with anything if there's illegal
activity," said Aaron Finn, director of online marketing for
Classmates.com, a frequent advertiser on many file-sharing networks.
"[But] I do feel that it's a very valuable technology that's been
developed, that will be used in many more legal ways than illegal
ways."</TE>
<TE>   The new networks differ from Napster enough that they hope to
dodge the legal bullets that felled their predecessor. Napster kept a
central directory of its users and the songs they stored, making it
liable for its users' copyright infringement.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the new peer-to-peer networks have no central
control--users connect through the Internet to search for and
retrieve files directly. Their hard drives essentially form a giant
library of music, pictures, movies and other software.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood studios, record labels and music publishers disagree
that the new networks are more legal than Napster. They sued the
owners or creators of Morpheus, Grokster and Kazaa in federal court
in October.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we brought this litigation is to make clear that what
these people are doing is illegal. That's what we plan to prove in
court," said Mark Litvack, director of legal affairs for the Motion
Picture Assn. of America's worldwide anti-piracy efforts. "When the
court renders that decision, I assume Mr. Finn will respond
accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike traditional broadcasters, Morpheus, Grokster and Kazaa
don't pay for the content that makes the networks so popular with
consumers, nor do they incur any of the costs of transmission.
Instead, their biggest expenses these days may be legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court in California has ruled against Napster's
free service, providing precedents that lawyers for the music and
movie industries hope to use in the current lawsuits. The three
upstarts counter that their decentralized networks, unlike Napster,
prevent them from knowing or controlling what their users do, so they
can't be held liable if users make pirated copies.</TE>
<TE>   The latest lawsuit has kept some big-name advertisers off the
file-sharing networks, but Steve Griffin, chief executive of
Morpheus' parent company, said it hasn't stopped Morpheus from
selling most of the advertising slots it makes available. The company
would have been profitable last year if not for its "extraordinary"
legal costs, Griffin said, and it expects to be profitable this year
even with those expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Morpheus nor Kazaa, which are privately held, would
disclose financial results. But estimates from vendors suggest that
each is collecting more than $450,000 a month from advertising.</TE>
<TE>   And advertising is just the starting point for many of the
file-sharing companies, which plan to capitalize on their sizable
followings in several new ways in the coming months. These include
"premium" advertising-free versions of the software; shopping
services that collect a fee for referring buyers to online retailers;
and secure delivery systems for copy-protected songs, books and
films.</TE>
<TE>   Several direct-marketing and advertiser-supported firms also pay
to have their programs bundled with the software needed to use a
peer-to-peer network. Although the fees are only a few pennies per
user, they add up to huge sums because millions of people download
the core software for Kazaa, Grokster and other file-sharing systems.</TE>
<TE>   By having consumers transmit files to each other, the networks
drastically cut the cost of distributing digital goods. Although some
peer-to-peer systems have worked with media companies to deliver
those goods efficiently for a fee, the most popular ones have enabled
consumers to copy whatever they like from each other for free.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the major record companies and music publishers sued
Napster in 1999, arguing that it was a tool for pirates. That lawsuit
shone a spotlight on Napster's free service, transforming it into a
global phenomenon with more than 70 million registered users.</TE>
<TE>   Federal court orders shuttered Napster's service, though, and the
company went broke trying to launch a copyright-friendly version that
charged users and compensated artists. The Napster lawsuit is on hold
for two weeks, giving the company time to find new backers or to seek
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   When Napster began blocking the flow of copyrighted songs last
year, its users flocked to new networks, with Morpheus and Kazaa
building the largest followings. They're still growing fast, with 4.2
million consumers downloading Kazaa last week and almost 900,000
downloading Morpheus.</TE>
<TE>   On the most popular peer-to-peer systems, advertising is pervasive
and relentless.</TE>
<TE>   The pitches come in three forms. Some are fixtures on the
file-sharing network's main page, like logos on a race car. Some take
turns occupying a portion of the screen, rotating every three minutes
or so. And some pop up in separate windows scattered across the
screen, holding their ground until the viewer closes or responds to
them.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Mahony Kept Cleric's Abuse Secret for 16 Years</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Archbishop failed to inform police and instead
reassigned priest. In a letter, he admits mishandling case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A popular Los Angeles priest told Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in 1986
that he molested young boys, but was reassigned to parishes and
allegedly continued his sexual abuse of minors for more than a
decade, documents and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony later approved a secret $1.3-million payment to two men who
said they had been abused by the priest, Father Michael Stephen
Baker, from 1984 to 1999. The cardinal arranged for the priest to
quietly retire from the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles in late
2000.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter of complaint that led to the settlement, attorney
Lynne M. Cadigan wrote that Mahony and the archdiocese had failed to
ensure that Baker did not repeat his sexual offenses against
children.</LD>
<TE>   "No one at the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, including Cardinal
Mahony ... reported Baker's sexual abuse of children to the
authorities, to the parents of the abused children or to any other
foreseeable victims. Nor did they attempt to find out all the
children that he had molested."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, now 54, allegedly molested at least nine youths beginning
in 1976, according to interviews with victims, relatives and lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until recent weeks that Mahony, under increasing
pressure to reveal the names of clerics accused of sexual misconduct,
reported Baker to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Mahony faxed a two-page letter to about 1,200 priests
in the archdiocese, acknowledging that he had mishandled the case.</TE>
<TE>   "As your archbishop, I assume full responsibility for allowing
Baker to remain in any type of ministry during the 1990s," Mahony
wrote. "I offer my sincere, personal apologies for my failure to take
firm and decisive action much earlier."</TE>
<TE>   The letter, addressed to "My Brother Priests," warned of
an upcoming media story on Baker. The Times has been preparing an
article about the priest. "You need to be aware that such a story
could come anytime now, and you need to be aware of the seriousness
of this case," Mahony wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal also notified the priests that archdiocese leaders
have now learned of more allegations of sexual misconduct against
Baker. He is one of at least 30 current and former priests from the
archdiocese under investigation by criminal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of interviews with The Times, Baker described going to
the offices of the archdiocese in 1986 and telling Mahony of his
problem with sexual abuse. He said that in one meeting, an
archdiocese lawyer suggested calling the police but that Mahony said
no.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said in an interview that he could not recall the
discussion with Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The case is emerging as a pivotal one for Mahony and archdiocese
leaders as they continue to grapple with the sexual abuse scandal
that has hit the Roman Catholic Church. In an interview last month,
Mahony called the Baker case the one "that troubles me the most."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has sought to portray himself as a defender of young
victims and an advocate of cooperating with criminal investigations.
At Pope John Paul II's historic meeting with American cardinals in
Rome last month, Mahony backed a "zero tolerance" policy for sexually
abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   But leaked e-mail correspondence between top archdiocese officials
reveals that Mahony was reluctant to turn over Baker's name to police
as recently as late March.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal answered some questions about Baker last month but
declined in the past week to be interviewed. An archdiocese spokesman
cited Mahony's workload and recovery from a recent blood clot in his
lung.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last month, the cardinal said the archdiocese had
few options in dealing with Baker because the allegations against him
were unproven. "Our biggest problem was that ... he wasn't found
guilty of a criminal act," Mahony said. "That's a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to priests, Mahony did not disclose his failure to
notify police when he learned about Baker's alleged abuses against
minors in 1986 and again in 2000. But he wrote, "If I had known in
those years what I discovered in early 2000, I would have dismissed
him from all ministry and requested his dismissal from the priesthood
in the late 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the cases involving archdiocese priests facing claims of
sexual abuse, Mahony said, Baker's is most troubling because he
allegedly molested a number of children in the 1970s, '80s and '90s
and continues to live in the area unsupervised.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised near Pasadena, Baker attended St. John's Seminary
in Camarillo. Ordained in 1974, he initially served as an associate
pastor at St. Joan of Arc parish in West Los Angeles for two years
before transferring to St. Paul of the Cross in La Mirada.</TE>
<TE>   Gregarious and charismatic, Baker was so well-liked at St. Paul
that several families followed him in 1982 when he was transferred to
St. Hilary in Pico Rivera. Baker was brought in as administrator and
associate pastor at a time when parishioners were deeply divided
along ethnic lines over a nun's alleged physical assault of a young
Latino pupil at St. Hilary Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was instrumental in pulling the parish together, church
officials said. He helped introduce a Sunday morning mariachi Mass
and organize an annual Mexican fiesta that appealed to Latino
families.</TE>
<TE>   "He speaks Spanish fluently," said Deacon Arturo Barragan, who
served with Baker at St. Hilary. "He has a capability of
understanding the experience of the Mexican people. He has been very
in touch with their culture."</TE>
<TE>   Baker also was known for his active involvement in youth groups
and teen clubs. He frequently took altar boys to the movies and on
overnight trips.</TE>
<TE>   The first incident of alleged abuse that has come to light took
place in 1976 when Baker invited a 9-year-old altar boy to spend the
night at St. Paul's rectory after a church-sponsored New Year's Eve
party.</TE>
<TE>   "That night was the beginning of a near-decade-long nightmare,"
the alleged victim, now 34 and living in West Hollywood, wrote
recently in a memo to his attorney. "I knew what was happening was
wrong, but felt trapped and would often just stare at the digital
clock on the nightstand, afraid to go to sleep.... "</TE>
<TE>   The Times does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their
consent.</TE>
<TE>   The man recalled in an interview with The Times that Baker took
him on trips to Palm Springs, Newport Beach, Reno and Chicago. He
said the abuse escalated to oral sex and that Baker occasionally
whispered to him, "You're the son of God."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Baker expressed remorse in a letter to the man. "I
know very well the confusion and hurt of the past and especially my
responsibility in that," Baker wrote on Jan. 29, 1994. "I don't know
what I can ever do."</TE>
<TE>   Eight other people have alleged that they were molested by
Baker in the late 1970s and '80s, according to interviews with them and
their lawyers. Two brothers say Baker began abusing them at St.
Hilary in 1984 when they were 5 and 7 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1985, Mahony was appointed head of the Los Angeles
Archdiocese. The following summer, at an annual series of retreats
for archdiocese priests, Mahony invited anyone who had engaged in
sexual abuse to talk to him privately.</TE>
<TE>   "We said to priests, 'If you have a problem or had a problem, it's
really beneficial to step forward now,'" Mahony recalled in last
month's interview. "We made it clear that, if you told us, we would
follow the policies."</TE>
<TE>   The procedures included removing a priest from ministry and
referring him for evaluation while the archdiocese investigated any
allegations, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of interviews with The Times, Baker declined to
comment on specific allegations of abuse. The priest said he admitted
in a private meeting with Mahony in December 1986 that he had engaged
in sexual abuse of minors.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Mahony I had a problem," Baker said in one of a series of
interviews with The Times. Mahony did not ask for specifics and
appeared willing to let him remain in the priesthood, Baker said. "He
was very solicitous and understanding. I was glad I brought it up."</TE>
<TE>   That evening, Baker said, he received a call from Msgr. Thomas
Curry, the vicar for clergy who oversaw all priests. Curry directed
Baker to return to archdiocese headquarters the next day.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived, Baker said, Curry was joined by Mahony and John
P. McNicholas, the archdiocese attorney. At the meeting, which lasted
about 30 minutes, Baker said he was asked the extent of his problem.
Baker said he disclosed that "two or three" victims were involved and
vowed not to engage in any future sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't recall them pressing me for details, and I didn't give
them any," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Baker said, he became startled when McNicholas
blurted, "Should we call the police now?" Baker said he recalled
Mahony's response: "No, no, no.... "</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has provided conflicting accounts of his discussions
with Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he said last month that he had no recollection of the
priest speaking to him about abusing boys. Mahony acknowledged that
he would probably remember such a meeting if it had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the cardinal said he thought Baker had approached Curry.
Curry, now bishop of Santa Barbara, said he could not recall the
Baker meeting either. "I just don't remember," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Mahony confirmed in his letter to archdiocese priests
that Baker had confessed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometime in late 1986, Baker disclosed to me that he had problems
in the past of acting out sexually with two minors," Mahony wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Priests and parents at the three parishes where Baker had served
until 1986 said the archdiocese failed to inform them about any
reported sexual abuse by Baker.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining his response, Mahony told the priests: "Baker was
sent to a treatment center for evaluation and recommendation for his
future. Following treatment, it was decided that he could do
specialized priestly ministry not related to children and youth. He
was subsequently given various ministries, such as special outreach
to our retired priests."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also required Baker to undergo continued counseling and
banned him from having one-on-one contact with minors.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal blamed Baker for not being honest during his
twice-a-month counseling sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "Baker's truthfulness was questionable," Mahony said in an
interview, adding that "we never found any evidence of cooperation.
He deceived his therapists, everybody."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Baker continued to have frequent access to children
over the next 14 years while he was assigned to nine different
parishes. Six of the churches where Baker worked had elementary
schools adjacent to the rectory: St. Thomas the Apostle in Los
Angeles, St. Elizabeth in Van Nuys, St. Linus in Norwalk, St. Mary in
Palmdale, St. Lucy in Long Beach and St. Columbkille in South-Central
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Records and interviews also show that Baker was sent to at least
three parishes to fill in for pastors who had either retired or been
transferred, leaving no superior to monitor his day-to-day
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly, I was a pinch-hitter to keep things running smoothly,"
Baker said of his relief duties.</TE>
<TE>   In his message to priests, Mahony said the archdiocese received no
reports of sexual abuse involving Baker until two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in ... 2000 we learned that two men in Arizona were
preparing to sue Baker for past sexual abuse," Mahony wrote. "Once we
became aware of that situation, he was removed immediately from all
priestly ministry in accordance with the policy in effect at that
time."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony did not include in his letter that the archdiocese had
received a 14-page letter of complaint that said Baker had continued
to molest the two men for 13 years after the priest confessed to the
cardinal in 1986. Nor did Mahony mention in the letter that he
authorized a $1.3-million settlement with the two men and that the
archdiocese insisted the deal remain secret.</TE>
<TE>   The Times obtained a copy of the letter of complaint that was sent
to the archdiocese in May 2000 by Tucson attorney Cadigan on behalf
of the two men, who are brothers now living in Mexico. The letter of
complaint describes the alleged abuses in detail.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time Mahony returned Baker to ministry in 1987,
the two brothers and their mother moved to Guadalajara. According to
the letter of complaint, Baker made the first of many trips to
Guadalajara to visit the boys in the spring of 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Baker also flew [the brothers] from Mexico to Los Angeles, Palm
Springs and Arizona approximately 15 times and, during the visits to
Los Angeles, had the boys sleep with him [in] the rectory, where he
molested them," the letter of complaint alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The document also states that Baker provided the brothers with
alcohol when they were young minors. The alleged abuses continued
until 1999, according to the letter of complaint. The two men said
they remained silent because Baker had threatened them if they told
anyone and they did not want to hurt their mother, who had befriended
the priest and regularly received money from him.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the letter of complaint, attorneys for the
archdiocese and Baker quickly offered to settle, Cadigan said. They
agreed to pay the brothers $1.3 million, among the largest
settlements at the time for victims of sexual abuse in the
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never had a case in my 19 years of handling sex abuse
claims that settled this quickly for this kind of money" without even
filing a lawsuit, Cadigan said. She concluded that archdiocese
officials knew "the allegations against Baker were true, there would
be more victims, and they didn't want any publicity. What they were
buying was silence."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he agreed to pay about half of the settlement from his
own funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to fight it," he said. "I didn't want to go public
and didn't want anyone to go through any more pain."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, Mahony's aides arranged for Baker to resign
from the priesthood. The archdiocese provided Baker about $10,000 in
severance pay and 18 months of health insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The pastor at St. Camillus de Lellis near USC, where Baker last
served, said he was told by a top aide to Mahony that the proper
authorities had been notified about Baker in late 2000. Father Chris
Ponnet said he had assumed the out-of-court settlement reached with
Baker's victims included a jail term or probation.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like this happens and a child ... is victimized,
I've always believed it was ... a crime," Ponnet said. "I was always
under the impression that if a crime had occurred, with or without
the settlement, the appropriate police and others would be working
with us."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until early this year, as the sex abuse scandal
mushroomed and Mahony came under pressure to reveal the names of
eight priests who had been previously accused of sexual misconduct,
that the cardinal turned Baker's name over to police.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the cardinal was hesitant to cooperate, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   According to confidential e-mail leaked to radio station KFI in
April, Baker was among the final three names Mahony had not provided
to law enforcement. In a March 27 e-mail to his top advisors titled
"Our Big Mistake," Mahony scolded the archdiocese lawyer, Sister Judy
Murphy, for resisting his suggestion that she "consult" with the Los
Angeles Police Department about the three names.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't, today, 'consult' with the [LAPD] about those three
names, I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into a Grand Jury
proceeding and I will be forced to give all the names, etc.," Mahony
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no middle ground on this; we are losing the battle
because we are somehow 'hiding' those three."</TE>
<TE>   On March 30, Murphy reminded members of the cardinal's inner
circle that Mahony was the one who resisted giving up Baker to police
until the day before his "Big Mistake" memo.</TE>
<TE>   "If you all remember, permission to do this was not given until
Tuesday," Murphy wrote. "He was reluctant about [Baker]."</TE>
<TE>   After The Times reported on April 17 that Baker was being
investigated by police, Mahony authorized pastors at a dozen parishes
where Baker had served to make an announcement during weekend Masses
in late April. The statement, which came 15 years after Mahony first
learned of Baker's past, encouraged anyone who had information that
might assist investigators to contact the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "Our faith teaches us that children are precious in God's eyes,"
the statement concluded. "Let's work together to make our homes,
parishes and schools safe havens for all our children."</TE>

<HD>NFL Stadium Plan Outlined</HD>
<DH>Downtown: The arena would be built near Staples Center
using city help. Backers say L.A. could lure one or two football
teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A business group trying to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles revealed
its plans Wednesday for a new, 64,000-seat football stadium near
Staples Center that will require financial assists from the city and
the league.</LD>
<LD>   Officials of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, or AEG, said they
will ask the city to issue bonds of up to $100 million to acquire 20
acres of downtown land for the stadium that the owners would repay
over time.</LD>
<LD>   From the National Football League, the group said, it will seek a
$150-million loan and a promise to bring three Super Bowl games to
Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   In return, the city could get at least one and possibly two NFL
franchises as the league tries to fill a vacuum in the nation's
second-largest media market, according to AEG officials, who built
Staples on a similar financial model.</TE>
<TE>   With the exploratory plans sprinting forward on several tracks,
AEG officials provided the most detailed description yet of the
stadium and the deal to build it. In an interview with The Times, AEG
President Tim Leiweke said the stadium would be built without any
burden on taxpayers--a departure of sorts for the NFL, which has
strongly encouraged public-private coalitions in the construction of
stadium complexes for its teams.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn "has made it clear to us that there will be no
risk to the general fund, no risk to taxpayers, and we said we heard
that loud and clear," Leiweke said. He said the stadium would cost
$400 million to $450 million to build.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has been without an NFL team since before the 1995
season, when the Rams departed for St. Louis and the Raiders for
their ancestral home, Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Putting a team back in L.A. has become one of the league's top
priorities--in part to tap the huge television market in Southern
California, in part because the league would like to get L.A. back in
the rotation for Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium deal is contingent upon bringing a team to L.A.
Speculation has focused on the San Diego Chargers' moving to a new
Los Angeles stadium, but Leiweke said half a dozen current NFL teams
may be contenders.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers and one other team have initiated discussions with
the developers, he said. He declined to name the other team.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday about the league's interest in seeing a team in
L.A., NFL spokesman Joe Browne said: "We are the National--underline
national--Football League and Los Angeles is the No. 2 market in the
nation. That seems to be a question with an obvious answer."</TE>
<TE>   The stadium would be within a redevelopment district that was
given final approval by the City Council on Wednesday. Within that
district, the city's redevelopment agency has the power to condemn
land and force people to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The AEG project envisions the city's use of eminent domain to
secure some of the land needed for the stadium. Ninety-five percent
of the parcel is now parking or warehouse space, Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no private homes or apartments would be condemned, he
said, one "blighted hotel" sits in the stadium's path. AEG has been
quietly buying up land in the area for the last several months under
a different name, he said, but has not yet acquired all the land it
would need.</TE>
<TE>   AEG officials declined to identify the precise site of the
proposed stadium, saying only it would be close to Staples and within
walking distance of a Blue Line light-rail station at Pico Boulevard
and Flower Street. If "everything was magic," Leiweke said, the
stadium could open in time for the 2005 NFL season. Leiweke stressed
that developers have not yet focused on a particular team. The group
hopes to secure three Super Bowls within a 10- to 12-year period
after the stadium opens. AEG has also held talks in the near future
with UCLA and USC about playing at the proposed downtown stadium,
although Leiweke acknowledged that USC is unlikely to abandon the
Coliseum, which adjoins its campus.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Wasserman, owner of the Arena Football League's L.A.
Avengers and a partner in the stadium group, said it also could serve
as a venue for international soccer matches, motocross, concerts and
other events. With one NFL franchise, he estimated that it would be
used 32 times a year; with two franchises, about 40 times.</TE>
<TE>   One criticism of football stadiums is that, compared with
basketball arenas or baseball stadiums, they are in use relatively
infrequently, and therefore not as effective as an economic
stimulant. Leiweke said that although his company is dedicated to
making a profit, not serving as a civic booster, he believes the
stadium would play a role in reinvigorating downtown.</TE>
<TE>   At this preliminary stage, Leiweke and others involved with the
project acknowledged, a slew of economic and political hurdles remain
to be cleared.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, AEG, the corporation founded by Denver billionaire
Philip Anschutz, sees reason for cautious optimism. And, after a
five-hour meeting last Thursday in New York at which the project was
discussed in detail with the league, the NFL is optimistic, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it makes economic sense, we'll push forward," Leiweke said.
"If it doesn't make economic sense, and stand on its own two feet,
we're out."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, at a meeting of NFL owners in Houston, Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue appointed a group of prominent owners to study an NFL
return to L.A., and raised the possibility of granting L.A. an
expansion team. He ruled out the Los Angeles Coliseum as a venue for
NFL football.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium proposal has sparked heated debate at Los Angeles City
Hall, where the City Council voted final approval Wednesday of the
plan to designate 879 acres of downtown as a redevelopment project
area.</TE>
<TE>   The designation allows the Community Redevelopment Agency to
collect about $2.4 billion in property tax and other revenue from the
area over the next 45 years to pay for revitalization of blighted
areas of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The money generated by the City Center Plan is supposed to help
build 12,900 housing units and up to 6.7 million square feet of new
commercial and industrial development, including construction of a
hotel next to the convention center. It also provides the mechanism
needed by AEG to acquire land for the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Most council members cautiously support the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely supportive of the NFL coming to Los Angeles, but
not on the back of taxpayer dollars. I want to make that clear, first
and foremost," said Council President Alex Padilla. "I think I speak
for most people in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has championed renovating the
Coliseum as a pro football stadium, said the AEG proposal needs heavy
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear from the proposal that they are interested in taking
advantage of ... the tools at the disposal of the public sector," he
said. "That gives the public sector a right to say how the deal ought
to come together."</TE>
<TE>   However, Councilman Dennis Zine, one of the three who voted
against the redevelopment district, said he was alarmed by the
proposal, which he called a "billionaire's boondoggle."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't find that a stadium is going to improve the
neighborhood," he said. "The fact is, the purpose of redevelopment is
not to build a football stadium. We're talking about skid row and the
homeless and people who live in cardboard boxes. They're not going to
live in the stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office declined to comment on the stadium plans, but said
the mayor would be at an AEG news conference today to discuss the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In building Staples Center, Anschutz and Leiweke demonstrated the
clout and credibility to navigate L.A. politics and get major
projects done. Other financial backers of the proposed downtown
stadium include billionaire supermarket mogul Ron Burkle, real estate
developer Ed Roski and Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz is the founder of Qwest Communications and has built a
sports and entertainment empire that includes ownership of the NHL
Kings and MLS Galaxy, part ownership of the Lakers and five European
hockey clubs. Forbes magazine estimates his net worth at $9.6
billion, putting him 16th on the 2001 list of richest Americans and
54th on the 2002 list of the world's richest people.</TE>
<TE>   Though he lives in Denver, Anschutz has been a major force in
trying to reshape downtown Los Angeles. In September, the City
Council approved his plans for a 27-acre, $1-billion entertainment
district near Staples Center, which now includes the proposed new
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   A rough model of the stadium depicts a horseshoe-shaped,
three-tiered structure that would hold 64,000 people for regular
games, 74,000 for Super Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Open at one end and at corners of the other, the stadium would
include 150 to 200 luxury boxes and perhaps 9,000 club seats. The
boxes would sell for perhaps $125,000 a year, the club seats for
$2,000 to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury boxes and club suites have emerged in recent years as key
sources of revenue for individual NFL team owners.</TE>
<TE>   It remains uncertain how that revenue would be divvied up between
developers and an NFL owner. Before dirt gets moved and concrete
poured, however, numerous moving parts need to be synchronized.</TE>
<TE>   AEG has asked the NFL to grant L.A. three Super Bowls; the NFL's
first response was to offer two. The first available Super Bowl is
2007.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, AEG needs league owners to approve what's called a
"G-3" loan, $150 million in the case of L.A. and other major cities.
Typically, the loan goes to teams as a stadium construction subsidy.
The catch is, there is no team yet to receive the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Both the loan and the Super Bowls must be approved by 24 of the 32
NFL owners. Leiweke said Wednesday that he hoped NFL officials would
move fast and recommend approval in the next 30 to 60 days, with an
owners' vote to follow shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   If NFL owners approve the $150-million loan, the ownership
group--AEG, Wasserman, Burkle and Roski--would underwrite the
remaining stadium construction costs, $250 million to $300 million.
That brings total stadium costs to $400 million to $450 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the city would use its right of eminent domain to stitch
together the required 20 acres, much of which is already owned by
AEG.</TE>
<TE>   The city--or perhaps the Community Redevelopment Agency--would
then buy all 20 acres, including the pieces bought recently on behalf
of the prospective ownership. Leiweke estimated that cost at $70
million to $100 million, to be paid with bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   Developers ultimately would pay that money back from a combination
of a ticket tax, sales tax generated by the venue and any excess
property tax from the site. It is not clear how long the payback
period would be, but Leiweke said taxpayers would be protected from
paying for the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to that," he said. "But I think both us and the
NFL believe this is a model we're prepared to live with.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to see if the economics work on this," Leiweke said.
"We're still not there yet. This is a work in progress."</TE>

<DH>A Catholic boys high school in Watts launches a work-study
program to help the institution and give students a head start in the
career world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Come fall, the students at Verbum Dei High School in Watts not only
will attend it, they will spend at least one day a week trying to
save it.</LD>
<LD>   The Roman Catholic all-boys college-prep campus is struggling with
low enrollment because many families in its nearby communities cannot
afford even its modest tuition. So, in a radical effort, all the
Verbum Dei students will work part time in corporations that will, in
return, pay much of their tuition.</LD>
<LD>   The change at Verbum Dei is patterned after a novel high school
started six years ago by Jesuits in one of Chicago's poorest
neighborhoods. It marks the first attempt in the nation to convert an
existing Catholic school completely to a work-study institution,
Catholic education officials say. The Los Angeles effort, they add,
is being closely watched as a possible solution for other urban
schools across the country with similar problems.</LD>
<TE>   For generations, urban Catholic schools have provided a leg up to
the children of families striving for a better life. Those parochial
schools' high academic standards, strict discipline and individual
attention, coupled with relatively low, church-subsidized tuitions,
offer an attractive alternative to the overcrowded, underachieving,
gang-plagued public schools in some urban neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The Verbum Dei effort, though undertaken primarily to save the
school, comes with an important side benefit: It is expected to give
its students, all African Americans or Latinos, an unusual amount of
experience and contacts in the business world.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great opportunity for us. It's going to show us
how the real world is," said Fredrick Gordon, 15, of Verbum Dei's
upcoming Corporate Work-Study Program. Fredrick, a sophomore, and
some schoolmates recently toured the high-rise offices of Aon Corp.,
a large insurance broker that has signed on with the program.</TE>
<TE>   The employers will provide a full-time, entry-level clerical job
that will be shared by four students, each working a different day of
the week, a total of five days per month.  Their collective $25,000
salary for the school year will be paid to the school to cover about
70% of the $8,800-per-student cost of one year of schooling for the
foursome. The annual tuition and fees are now $3,700, and two-thirds
of the families receive financial aid. With the work-study program,
tuition and fees will drop to $2,200 per student, and scholarships
will continue for families who need them.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had to address the problem of the unaffordability of
education in urban areas," said Father William Wood, who was named
Verbum Dei's president two years ago. After studying various options,
the school decided to "move from a financing system that is
tuition-driven to one that is job-driven."</TE>
<TE>   But that means other changes as well. The school day will be
lengthened and course schedules rearranged so students do not miss
out on class time while they are on the job. The fabled sports
program will be altered too.</TE>
<TE>   Since its 1962 founding, Verbum Dei--"Word of God" in Latin--has
groomed ninth- through 12th-graders from some of Los Angeles' meanest
streets for college. Its tidy, low-slung campus, built around a
chapel and flower-filled courtyards, faces Central Avenue, just a few
blocks south of the flash point of the 1965 Watts riots. Behind it
sprawls the notorious Nickerson Gardens public housing project.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-two percent of its students are African American, and the
other 38% are Latino; fewer than half are Catholic, and the majority
of families live below the federally defined poverty level. Most of
the students go on to college.</TE>
<TE>   "The Verb," as it has long been nicknamed, has increasingly
required financial help from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which
operates the school. Built for 400 students, the campus had an
enrollment dip to 163 students in the fall of 2000. Reductions in
course offerings and other painful cuts were eroding the academic
program.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony asked the Jesuits, who run the
highly successful Loyola High School west of downtown, to take over
Verbum Dei and find a way to save it.</TE>
<TE>   Many urban-core Catholic schools across the country have closed in
the last two decades as their upwardly mobile families moved to the
suburbs. Traditional ways to keep the doors open for poor
families--hefty archdiocesan tuition subsidies, fund-raising drives
and donations from foundations--were not enough in those cases, said
Jeffrey D. Thielman. He is executive director of the Cassin
Educational Initiative Foundation, which was started two years ago to
help establish work-study Catholic schools across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Thielman said the work-study model is not only a financial
solution but one that benefits student in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Work-study provides an opportunity for a young person to earn his
or her college-prep school education while getting a tremendous
amount of exposure to the world of law, banking, finance. And it
makes sense from a business point of view because it provides
talented workers for entry-level clerical jobs, where there is a
great need and a high turnover," Thielman said.</TE>
<TE>   The program had its roots in the early 1990s in Chicago, when
then-Cardinal Joseph Bernardin asked the local priests of the Society
of Jesus (Jesuits), known for its excellent schools and universities
around the world, to better serve the largely poor, Mexican immigrant
neighborhoods of Pilsen and Little Village on the city's southwest
side.</TE>
<TE>   They devised the work-study program to open Cristo Rey Jesuit High
School, the first new Catholic high school in the city in more than
three decades.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1996 with fewer than 100 students, all dropouts or
transfers from public schools, and 15 corporate sponsors. Today it is
nearing its 500-student maximum, sending most to college, and has 110
firms on board.</TE>
<TE>   "Sending a 14- or 15-year-old into an adult world five days a
month does wonders," said Dan O'Brien, a workplace coordinator at
Cristo Rey (Spanish for "Christ the King") and liaison for other
schools that want to follow the Chicago example, including Verbum
Dei.</TE>
<TE>   "The interaction with adults in the workplace gives our students
tremendous poise and confidence," O'Brien added. "They will be years
ahead of the curve, and if they play their cards right, the world is
theirs for the taking."</TE>
<TE>   Modeled on Cristo Rey, a new urban Catholic high school opened
last year in Portland, Ore. A needy neighborhood in Austin, Texas,
will get a work-study school this fall, and there are plans for
another to open in Tucson next year. Similar schools are planned in
New York City's South Bronx, Boston, Cleveland, Denver and
Waukegan/North Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to lining up corporations, Verbum Dei officials have
been preparing students for their new duties--including answering
phones, filing, copying, faxing, word processing and other computer
work--by busing them once a week after school to the PUENTE Learning
Center, a Catholic job training and literacy program near downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Verbum Dei is developing a new "block" schedule to ensure that
students cover all their classwork, and it will provide
transportation to the jobs. Returning students will start the school
year early, Aug. 19, and incoming freshmen must attend a summer
session to prepare them for the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   At the school long known as a sports powerhouse, especially in
basketball, athletes will be required to miss team practices--and
games--that fall on their workdays. And, in perhaps the most vivid
example of change, officials suspended the football program for the
coming school year while the work-study program launches.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get our staff on board, and our families. It was our
kids that helped sell it," said Principal Benjamin Callaway, a lay
Catholic whom the Jesuits coaxed out of retirement after a 37-year
career in the Detroit public schools.</TE>
<TE>   English teacher Margaret Triplett, who came to Verbum Dei eight
years ago after the closure of the Catholic girls school where she
had been working, said she embraced the new program at first as a way
to save the school but now believes it will also "be really good for
our students."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will really energize them and give them a chance to
show what they can do," Triplett said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Guerrero of Watts said she was overjoyed to learn about the
work-study program because it enables her to send her son, Jorge
Andara, 16, back to Verbum Dei this fall for his senior year. He
spent his first two years of high school there, but the single mother
said that, even with a partial scholarship, she could not afford to
keep him there on her $12,000-a-year earnings as an inventory clerk.
Jorge is completing his junior year at Jordan, a large public high
school nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very good boy, but he started to get in with the wrong
crowd, and his grades dropped," she said. Guerrero said she has been
saving all she can to send Jorge and his brother Danny Andara, 15,
who will be a freshman, to Verbum Dei this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to me for them to get a good education. I
didn't have that chance, and I know how hard it is to get along
without it," Guerrero said. Best of all, she added, her sons "will
feel good because they are working for it."</TE>
<TE>   The task of finding firms to hire the students has fallen to
Father Scott Santarosa, the school's director of development, and to
Jeff Bonino-Britsch, who previously worked on social justice programs
for the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   They opened their thick Rolodexes and started with people long
active in other Catholic school and archdiocesan causes.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm From Corporate World</TE>
<TE>   Michael L. McRoskey, senior vice president for corporate services
at CB Richard Ellis Inc., said his realty firm leaped at the chance
to provide a job for Verbum Dei students.</TE>
<TE>   "So many times you get asked to donate dollars and don't know
where they go; you don't get to see the fruits of your donation,"
said McRoskey, a Loyola High alumnus and a past board member for a
Catholic girls school. "But here you get a chance to interact with
bright, well-trained young men and be a part of their lives and their
futures. It's much more personal, and that makes it all the more
rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   Some Verbum Dei families, uncomfortable with the changes, have
decided to send their sons elsewhere this fall, and enrollment is
expected to drop below 150. Officials, however, expect the enrollment
to start climbing strongly if the work-study program proves
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Comeaux Sr., whose son Kevin Jr., 15, is a freshman, said
preparing for the work-study program "already has given Kevin a lot
of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a big adjustment for everybody, but this school
is very good at working closely with the students to help them do
their best, and it's going to be worth it," Comeaux said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Verbum Dei's students said they hope the program will lead
to summer jobs and help them find mentors.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Andre Okoreeh, 15, said he was "a little worried at
first. I was afraid it would interfere with my schoolwork, and I am
in a lot of school activities that I don't want to give up."</TE>
<TE>   But his recent tour of Aon Corp. helped.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never been to an office like that, and I loved it. So now,
while I still have some concerns, I am willing to give it a chance. I
think it will help me get into college," Andre said.</TE>

<CX>   Learning center--An article in Thursday's Section A about changes at
Verbum Dei High School erred in describing the PUENTE Learning Center

<DH>Church: A Baltimore neighborhood is divided after a
shooting by an alleged sex abuse victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE, VICKI KEMPER and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>When Dontee Stokes first alleged nine years ago that his parish
priest had sexually molested him, the church rallied around its
popular clergyman. Yellow ribbons sprouted outside St. Edward Roman
Catholic Church, where congregants asserted the innocence of Father
Maurice Blackwell.</LD>
<LD>   But Wednesday, as Blackwell lay wounded in a hospital bed and his
now 26-year-old accuser faced a charge of attempted murder, the
church was locked up tight. Its new pastor took no calls.</LD>
<LD>   Attitudes have shifted as sex abuse by clergy, a crime few could
fathom a decade ago, now seems terribly commonplace. This time,
violence has marked one case of alleged abuse, a tragedy played out
in a struggling neighborhood where a priest and a young man lived for
years, each with their mothers, two blocks apart.</LD>
<TE>   "We live every day with the fear that something like this may
happen," said David Clohessy, director of Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests, a Chicago-based support group. "There is so much
pent-up pain that just now is finally beginning to surface."</TE>
<TE>   It boiled up on the 700 block of Reservoir Street on Monday night,
when Stokes allegedly stuffed into a duffel bag a .357 Magnum
revolver that few could believe such a peaceful man would own.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell, 56, was standing outside his row house when he was shot
three times, allegedly by Stokes.</TE>
<TE>   The priest suffered wounds to his hand and hip.</TE>
<TE>   For some it was hard to figure why Stokes--a quiet barber who read
the Bible and had no criminal record--would have sought revenge so
long after the alleged crime was committed.</TE>
<TE>   But others thought that was no mystery at all.</TE>
<TE>   He was 17 when he told a therapist that his pastor had fondled him
over a three-year period during Bible study sessions. Authorities
investigated. Stokes never wavered from his account, taking two
polygraph tests and passing them both.</TE>
<TE>   But Blackwell denied the accusations and cooperated with police,
insisting: "I don't have anything to hide."</TE>
<TE>   The claim was classified as "inappropriate touching," a
fourth-degree misdemeanor with no witnesses. The state attorney's
office declined to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   But an independent review board summoned by the church thought
otherwise, finding the young Stokes "credible and consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell spent three months in a psychiatric treatment center in
Connecticut that specialized in sexual abuse by clergy. An evaluation
found "no clinical evidence of pedophilia," and once Blackwell was
released, Cardinal William Keeler, Baltimore's archbishop, restored
the priest to his parish on the condition that he no longer counsel
young men.</TE>
<TE>   The parish was overjoyed to have him back.</TE>
<TE>   "He has great gifts for the vocation he has followed: enormous
energy, great compassion ... an impish and irrepressible sense of
humor," officers of the parish council wrote to the Catholic Review,
the weekly archdiocesan newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The ugly episode, widely publicized at the time, faded from memory
for most everyone but Stokes. He left his Catholic high school for a
public school, and then dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood is small, and over the years he could hardly have
avoided his alleged assailant. He must have passed him at the
convenience store and on the street corners where Blackwell happily
handed out volleyballs to the local children and won kudos trying to
rescue drug peddlers from a life of crime.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell was, after all, something of a treasure to a Catholic
Church that struggles to recruit priests, particularly African
American ones.</TE>
<TE>   Only the second black to be ordained in the Baltimore Archdiocese,
he was widely praised for opening an office dedicated to black
parishioners. He understood the culture so well that he instituted a
tradition of broom-jumping at weddings, an old slave custom.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes was respected in the neighborhood too--a boy who grew up on
rough streets "but never did hang around with roughnecks," one
neighbor said. Devoted to the church in his youth, he avoided trouble
that would have been easy to find.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes took a job at Original Superman's Barbershop, often
bringing his daughter, nearly 2, to work with him. In August, he
planned to marry his child's mother. After the alleged abuse, he
turned his back on the Catholic Church but not on faith itself,
joining a Baptist congregation a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a second victim came forward, and Blackwell admitted to a
five-year homosexual relationship with a minor that had ended 20
years earlier. For that transgression, he was placed on involuntary
leave and suspended from celebrating Mass and other sacraments.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work as executive director of Maryland One Church-One
Addict, an interfaith program that urges congregations to help
recovering addicts.</TE>
<TE>   But Stokes' complaints remained unavenged. Family and friends say
he suffered from depression and once attempted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, as he headed to meet his fiancee, Stokes allegedly
spotted Blackwell on Reservoir Street.</TE>
<TE>   He circled back and addressed the priest, who refused to
acknowledge him, according to the police report.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they heard Stokes demand an apology; Blackwell
would not comply. Stokes then allegedly shot him, later telling
police that he didn't know what had come over him.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, Stokes sought out his Baptist minister, who
was holding a service at a local church. When the minister asked if
anyone would like to come forward and dedicate his life to the Lord,
Stokes rose from the wooden pews and walked toward the white altar.
Church members prayed over him. Stokes asked to speak to the minister
privately; then they both went to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Shootings are not uncommon in this West Baltimore neighborhood;
there was one Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Under other circumstances, the Blackwell shooting would have been
an open-and-shut case: A gunman drives by, shoots a man on the street
and confesses.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, the residents are divided over who the victim
is.</TE>
<TE>   If Stokes was truly molested, then he was a teenage boy who did
everything right: He went to authorities and the system failed him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is terribly hurtful when a survivor gathers the courage to
disclose abuse to church authorities and is then rebuffed," said
Clohessy of the Chicago support group. "It's incredibly traumatic for
people to have to run into their perpetrator, for survivors to see
the priest who abused them still wearing the Roman collar."</TE>
<TE>   And Stokes' friends believe the growing reports of sex abuse must
have been too much for him to bear.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't get any psychiatric help," said Daaiyah Bryant, 24, who
works with Stokes.</TE>
<TE>   "Then to hear all of this now, every time you turn on the TV it's
'sex scandal, sex scandal.' He probably just couldn't hear it no
more."</TE>
<TE>   If Blackwell is innocent, as some in the neighborhood firmly
believe, then the system may serve him well in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes could face a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted
of attempted murder; he is also charged with first- and second-degree
assault and handgun violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he did it. I don't think he forced himself on
anybody. The Catholic Church is making him seem like a dirty old
priest," insisted M.L. Hearn, who lives on a street that runs right
up to Blackwell's house.</TE>
<TE>   He was the first to respond to the shots, called 911 and shielded
the priest's mother from the sight.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Stokes appeared in court via closed-circuit monitor,
asking the judge to release him on bail so he could see his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to say I'm not a flight risk and I'm not at risk to
myself," he said. "Although I may be depressed, I'm not suicidal."</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered a psychiatric evaluation, postponing the
arraignment until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes' mother professed her love for him on television, a picture
of her son as a toddler behind her. "I believed him from the Day 1
and I'm still here with him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The family set up a post office box, inviting others who may say
they are victims of Blackwell to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   The church has acknowledged only the two known complaints.</TE>
<TE>   At the barbershop, Stokes' station, third from the door, stood
empty as the phone rang with offers of assistance. His boss, Kelly
Jones, vowed to go to every court hearing and promised that his job
would be waiting.</TE>
<TE>   And outside the house on Mount Royal Terrace that Stokes shares
with his mother, a black ribbon hung from the porch lamp.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Elizabeth Shogren contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Bush Told of Likely Hijacks</HD>
<DH>Plot: White House then warned law officers but not public
after August report. Congress has launched an inquiry into mishandled
intelligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A month before the Sept. 11 attacks, senior CIA officials warned
President Bush that members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network
might try to hijack airplanes, prompting the White House to issue an
alert to U.S. law enforcement agencies, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   White House and CIA officials said the intelligence behind the
warning was not specific, however, and that nothing then available
hinted at Bin Laden's plot to seize four passenger jets and use them
as weapons.</LD>
<LD>   But the latest indication of another possible missed signal raised
fresh concerns as to whether U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and
aviation agencies were sufficiently on guard to prevent an attack on
U.S. soil.</LD>
<TE>   House and Senate committees have launched a joint investigation
into how America's vast intelligence agencies failed to detect the
plot. Other congressional committees are looking into why the FBI
ignored an internal memo in July that specifically warned that Bin
Laden's followers could be training at U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA warning of a possible hijacking, first reported Wednesday
night by CBS News, indicates for the first time that the White House
also may have failed to recognize the imminent threat posed by Bin
Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Bush was told of the possibility of a hijacking in
early August during a regular morning intelligence report, a highly
classified written and oral presentation known as the President's
Daily Brief. Bush was on vacation at his ranch near Crawford, Texas,
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Wednesday that the
information was not clear enough to prevent the September attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, however.</TE>
<TE>   "There was of course an awareness by the government, including the
president, of Osama bin Laden and the threat he posed in the United
States and around the world," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that Bush was warned about "hijackings in the
traditional sense, not suicide bombers using airplanes as missiles."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the administration notified domestic law
enforcement agencies of a possible hijacking threat, but did not
announce the alert to the public.</TE>
<TE>   A senior intelligence official said Bush was told that hijackings
were "among the range of possibilities" that Al Qaeda might use, as
other Islamic militants had hijacked planes in the recent past.</TE>
<TE>   "This was among the many things that we talked about all the time
as a potential terrorist threat," said the official, who downplayed
the significance of the warning.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing about hijacked aircraft that would be flown
into buildings or anywhere else," the official said. "We had no
specific information about the time, the place, or the means of
attack."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, FBI Director Robert Mueller has moved swiftly, and
vocally, to address shortcomings within the bureau that he admits
allowed it to miss potential warning signs before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who took over the bureau just a week before the attacks,
has said he plans to beef up intelligence gathering and information
sharing with the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   He also is already centralizing counter-terrorism measures at
Washington headquarters. Most of the FBI's Al Qaeda hunters in the
past were based in the New York City field office, where Bin Laden
and others were indicted for their alleged roles in the 1998 bombings
of two U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 people, including
12 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   And in unusually frank congressional testimony last week, Mueller
said that the bureau missed at least one important warning sign two
months before the attacks, even though he said it would not have
averted the Sept. 11 assaults.</TE>
<TE>   In July, an FBI counter-terrorism agent in Phoenix wrote an
internal document warning that Islamic militants were trying to gain
access to U.S. flight training schools and other aviation facilities,
perhaps to commit terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   In a classified memo sent to FBI headquarters and to a special New
York FBI unit hunting Al Qaeda, the agent urged a full-scale
investigation into all flight training schools and aviation
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   No such investigation was launched until several Middle Eastern
men, who had trained at flight schools in the United States, had
carried out the attacks, killing more than 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources now admit that the Phoenix FBI agent also
mentioned Bin Laden by name and suggested that his Al Qaeda followers
could be behind such terrorist plots.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week
that Louis J. Freeh, then director of the FBI, and CIA director
George J. Tenet were never told about the Phoenix memo.</TE>
<TE>   "Should we have done more in terms of the Phoenix [memo]? Yes,"
Mueller said. "Prior to Sept. 11, we did not focus as we should on
our analytical capability, understanding that we have to take every
piece that may be provided to us and put it in a larger framework in
a larger puzzle. We have changed dramatically to address some of
these shortcomings."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said he was particularly troubled by
the bureau's failure to pursue the Phoenix agent's warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very troubled by this, and I think that it is likely to
become a major concern for Americans, because in my committees on
Capitol Hill, we have been assured and reassured that the tragedy of
Sept. 11 was unanticipated; it came as a startling surprise to those
who followed terrorist activities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Durbin said the memo is likely to become "one of the most
important documents in our national debate about whether we did
enough to protect America from the attack of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she was extremely concerned
about such missed warning signs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if it did drop between the cracks, I think there is a
serious problem, because if one thing drops, others probably have as
well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She similarly questioned whether the FBI responded appropriately
after agents arrested Zacarias Moussaoui in August in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   After local flight school instructors called the FBI, agents
concluded that Moussaoui might be considering trying to use a
commercial aircraft in a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, FBI agents sought a special warrant to search
his laptop computer for evidence of a terrorist plot, but officials
at headquarters turned down the request rather than take it to the
Justice Department to see if a federal judge thought there was enough
cause to approve the warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was indicted in December in a federal court in Virginia
and charged with conspiring with the 19 hijackers and Bin Laden in
the attacks and of perhaps trying to be the 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   And in another case, a third flight school expressed concerns last
year to an Federal Aviation Administration official about the
activities of one of its students. No action was taken against that
student, Hani Hanjour, who the FBI says later piloted one of the
hijacked planes.</TE>
<TE>   "What you had were individual investigations and they were all
compartmented from each other," said Vincent Cannistraro, a former
CIA counter-terrorism official and an expert on Al Qaeda. "If the
intelligence was gathered in one place, someone should have been able
to see that there was a threat, that there was a common thread among
all of these."</TE>
<TE>   He called the missed signals "extremely embarrassing" for the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The threats were there to paint a picture of a coming attack but
no one did anything about it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Rebuilding on W. Bank Rubble to Be Costly, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Palestinians: An international group assesses the direct
damage at $361 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's military offensive last month against Palestinian areas of
the West Bank resulted in $361 million in wrecked roads, squashed
cars, broken computers and destroyed buildings, along with several
times that amount in indirect damage, according to a report released
Wednesday by donor countries and international agencies.</LD>
<LD>   According to the group's report, the West Bank city of Nablus
suffered the greatest direct damage, estimated at $114 million, with
almost half of that linked to destruction at cultural sites. An
ancient public bath, historic houses and the Khadra mosque were hit
hard and will require specialized contractors. Some of the sites date
back almost 1,000 years.</LD>
<LD>   The West Bank cities of Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem each
suffered heavy damage, ranging from $23.8 million to $82.7 million,
according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   The group, known as the Local Aid Coordination Committee, is made
up of United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and nations that provide aid to Palestinian areas in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The $361-million figure cited by the group represents only the
most obvious damage, said members of the team that assembled the
report. The broad-based damage to the regional economy is far
greater.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did the group survey damage in the heavily populated Gaza
Strip, which was left largely untouched by the Israeli army in its
recent five-week incursion. A decision was made to put off that study
until it was clear whether the Israelis are going to send troops in
there too for an extended campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the indirect damage, the overall figure rises to
over $2 billion," said Geir Pedersen, Norwegian representative to the
Palestinian Authority. "And if anything happens in Gaza, we'll
definitely have to go in again. I hope we won't."</TE>
<TE>   Assembling the damage report was relatively easy compared with the
next task: finding money to pay the repair bill. Donor countries,
including the United States, Japan, Germany, Italy and France,
pledged a total of about $150 million at a meeting Monday. It's
unlikely the full amount needed will be reached, however, given donor
fatigue and concerns that repaired infrastructure might be destroyed
again in future combat.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is a member of the donor committee but is not expected to
help rebuild the sites hit as part of a concentrated campaign against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone wants to send a bill, send it to [Palestinian Authority
President] Yasser Arafat," said Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "He's the one who launched the terrorist
activities."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli defense forces have come under criticism in recent weeks
for destroying Palestinian culture and education ministries, police
stations, municipal offices and schools in their bid to root out
Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Nigel Roberts, World Bank representative to the West Bank and
Gaza, said Wednesday it was difficult to see how many of the sites
damaged by the Israeli military represented a security threat.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the sites were not mere ministries or schools, countered
Lt. Col. Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman for the Israeli military.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the Education Ministry, it's been very
supportive of terrorism in books and classes," he said. "They're
training a whole generation for violence. I would ask you to be a
little suspicious of the Education Ministry."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Palestinian Authority has come under growing
internal and external pressure to reform itself and stem corruption.
Donor countries are concerned that the money they provide will not be
used for its intended purposes.</TE>
<TE>   World Bank officials said ultimately the reform impetus must come
from within the Palestinian leadership. The problem also must be put
in perspective, they added, citing their agency's survey of
international businesspeople last year that rated Arab countries as
more corrupt than the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Palestinians, however, some donors have been
asked to fund the same projects more than once, given the military
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of countries said, 'We've spent a lot of money, now
that's destroyed. What guarantee do we have that soldiers won't come
in and do it again?'" said Timothy Rothermel, special representative
with the United Nations Development Program. "And sure, there's donor
fatigue out there as well."</TE>
<TE>   Israel could improve the welfare of the Palestinian areas and help
its own long-term security by easing the tough travel restrictions in
the West Bank, argued Michael Keating, director of socioeconomic
affairs for UNESCO. The limits hamper trade, prevent people from
working and delay any semblance of normal life.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think economic collapse and social despair are in the
interest of the Palestinians, of course," Keating said. "But they're
also not in Israel's interest. It creates fertile ground for
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Development officials also would like Israel to release hundreds
of millions of dollars in tax revenue it collected on behalf of the
Palestinian Authority under a joint tax treaty. Karim Nashashibi, an
International Monetary Fund representative, said the figure due was
$507 million as of December and has grown an estimated $30 million a
month since.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank's Roberts said the donor group has seen no evidence
that the Palestinian Authority's budget is used to finance terrorism,
a central Israeli argument against handing over the money.</TE>
<TE>   But Gissin, the spokesman for Sharon, said Israel would continue
to withhold payment until it was sure that funds weren't either
lining the pockets of Palestinian officials or buying weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Bank doesn't know where the money goes, but we do," he
said. "All the money Arafat received went to his own coffers or to
purchase arms or finance suicide bombers."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's restrictions have affected many health, social and
environmental areas of Palestinian life, said Mohammed Said Alhmaidi,
donor country coordinator for Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Alhmaidi said he has been trying for the past three months to gain
Israeli permits to remove tons of human, commercial, toxic, chemical
and medical waste in Ramallah, only to be told repeatedly that moving
it represents a security risk. This has forced authorities to store
the materials in open areas, which risks contaminating the food
supply, ground water and people's health. "They just keep saying no,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials added that the Palestinians remain resilient and that if
aid is distributed soon, most West Bank infrastructure problems could
be repaired within a year.</TE>

<LD>   "It is the time for change and reform. I'm calling for a
reevaluation of all our administrative and ministerial bodies, the
security apparatuses, after there have been signs of mismanagement
here and there that are impossible to conceal from public opinion."</LD>
<LD>   "We may have made mistakes or caused damage ... in one realm of
responsibility or another, but we have guarded security and our
national goals."</LD>
<TE>   "Palestinian and Arab public opinion have reached a point where
they agree such operations [attacks on Israeli civilians] do not
serve our goals. On the contrary, it creates the hatred within the
international community that was behind the creation of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you if there was a mistake [in the deals to end sieges in
Ramallah and Bethlehem], put it all on my shoulders. I can handle it.
There is no movement in which mistakes are not found."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Force Maintains High Profile Despite Risks</HD>
<DH>Military: Coalition troops exhibit little concern about
rocket attacks or huge caches of ammunition found in a cave above
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORGUN, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>ORGUN, Afghanistan -- Whether they are facing Al Qaeda stragglers
spoiling for a fight or power-hungry warlords firing occasional
rockets at their outposts, coalition troops here are exhibiting
little concern and even less inclination to lower their profile.</LD>
<LD>   Smack in the exposed heart of a scorching ochre plain ringed by
rugged mountains, the small compound only one ridge away from
terrorist-infiltrated tribal areas of Pakistan defiantly flies the
Stars and Stripes on one flagpole and the red, black and green Afghan
banner on another.</LD>
<LD>   This dusty, brush-choked U.S. base in southeastern Afghanistan
forms a front line for the war's new focus: destroying cached
weapons, tracking enemy movements along the border and fostering the
peace taking root apace with the sprouting grain fields and replanted
orchards.</LD>
<TE>   Still, bringing tranquillity to this most troubled corner of
Afghanistan is a work in progress. Coalition officers at Bagram air
base on Wednesday disclosed the discovery of two more hidden supplies
of armaments, including more than 2 million rounds of ammunition, in
a hillside cave with a bird's-eye view of the U.S. operations here.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the munitions stashed in caves and culverts throughout the
country are being used with apparent intent to intimidate the
U.S.-led forces. At least six rocket attacks have been logged here,
at the nearby Khowst airfield and across the border in the Pakistani
town of Miram Shah, another U.S. Special Forces venue, since enemy
fighters retreated in March to their mountain strongholds on the
border after Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. compound here is little more than a stone house, a few
outbuildings and a sprawling tent village inside a waist-high
enclosure of barbed wire. The understated defenses and the calm, if
secretive, demeanor of its forces suggest a low assessment of the
risks from an occasional missile.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been hurt nor any property damaged, but the potshots
have irritated U.S. commanders to the point of their ordering a
recent special search-and-attack mission.</TE>
<TE>   That operation here in Paktika and adjacent Paktia provinces
failed to flush out any suspected terrorists or even to halt their
fire. But a thorough combing of the surrounding high ground did chase
the enemy away from the best vantage points, U.S. soldiers say.</TE>
<TE>   "There was firing around us, but we weren't able to figure out if
they were targeting us or local fighters in the area," Capt. Patrick
Harkins said of the effort by troops of the 101st Airborne Division
to hunt down those shooting at U.S. forces in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition officers insist that Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants
remain active in the volatile southeastern provinces that share a
border with the lawless tribal areas. But regional rivalries and
pockets of resistance to the rule of interim Afghan Prime Minister
Hamid Karzai also may be fomenting aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Warlord Bacha Khan, the ousted Paktia leader locked in battle with
his Karzai-appointed successor, Taj Mohamad Wardak, rained 500 bombs
on nearby Gardez late last month in a deadly gambit to stay in power.
Karzai hinted Tuesday that he may ask the U.S. troops here for
assistance in quelling the warlord.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, though, say intervening in local conflicts exceeds
their role.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mandate is to capture or kill Al Qaeda terrorists and senior
Taliban who supported them," said U.S. Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty,
spokesman for the coalition's 17,000-strong Afghan deployment. While
also expected to help the Karzai government get a rein on a society
racked by decades of violence, the coalition is "generally not"
inclined to take sides, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those plotting the endgame of the mission to deny safe haven to
terrorists in Afghanistan insist that they still enjoy succor here
and can easily shuttle back and forth to fundamentalist strongholds
in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The tribal areas are virtually impervious to the authority of
Pakistan's national government, despite President Pervez Musharraf's
stated support of the anti-terror drive. On Wednesday, Pakistan
deployed 1,000 troops to aid American operatives monitoring movements
along the border.</TE>
<TE>   While Special Forces troops and undercover operatives of "other
agencies"--namely the FBI and CIA--at work here are prohibited from
discussing their missions, their numbers and reach appear aimed at
winning over war-weary locals while weeding out the troublemaking
remnants.</TE>
<TE>   Well-drilling, bridge and road repair, and delivery of school
supplies stand as a contrast, in the eyes of many locals, to the
persistent fighting and power-grabbing they have suffered for a
quarter-century. In the six months since the Taliban's ouster, ruins
are systematically being transformed into respectable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. bases, nestled between soaring, pine-dappled ridges, are
also being used as training grounds for the emerging Afghan national
army, an expected 100,000-strong fighting force that coalition
officers hope will one day be self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops flying supply missions from Bagram to Khowst and Orgun
say what was once a wary reception has become increasingly warm.</TE>
<TE>   From his gunner's perch aboard a Black Hawk helicopter sweeping
just above the rural rooftops of nearby villages, Sgt. Bob Roubanalis
now spends more time returning the waves of children and goat herders
than searching the countryside for the odd renegade with a grudge.</TE>
<TE>   Below, campfire smoke rises from tent enclaves, and wild horses
stampede away from the whomp of the Black Hawk rotors. A four-year
drought has finally given way to sporadic deluges, nourishing freshly
planted fields and replenishing dried-up rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Aviators are evasive when asked if they've been fired on while
patrolling the region, but most feel the tide is turning in their
favor.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're flying over, a lot of people come out to watch us. At
first it was probably out of curiosity because the Soviets had been
gone for a long time and the Afghans don't have too many aircraft.
But now they wave," said Capt. Matt Woods, an air liaison officer at
Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   While no one is yet prepared to declare the shooting war over, the
U.S.-led coalition's campaign to eradicate Al Qaeda and Taliban from
the country has evolved from firefights to surveillance. And the
quiet fine-tuning of Afghanistan's security balance is intended to
keep the enemy at bay and the locals nurturing crops instead of
resentment.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it about over? I wouldn't think so," Gen. Tommy Franks, the
Florida-based commander of U.S. forces in the region, told troops
Wednesday in the Afghan city of Kandahar during a one-day,
three-venue tour of the front.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not yet convinced the network is totally done," Franks said
of the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. "As long as it's not done, we're
going to be here working."</TE>

<HD>N. Ireland Militant Is Paroled</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>Johnny "Mad Dog" Adair, Northern Ireland's most notorious Protestant
militant, was paroled from jail Wednesday, a move that police and
politicians said could exacerbate sectarian tensions in Belfast.</LD>
<LD>   More than 200 flag-waving supporters cheered as Adair, a Belfast
commander of the outlawed Ulster Defense Assn. that has long attacked
the Roman Catholic community, gave a clenched-fist salute outside
Maghaberry prison west of Belfast, the provincial capital.</LD>
<LD>   Adair spoke only briefly to a throng of reporters, saying he felt
"brilliant." His UDA colleague, John White, said he understood that
many Catholics were fearful about his friend's freedom.</LD>
<TE>   Catholics "have nothing to fear from Johnny Adair. Johnny Adair
will be a force for good in this province," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Adair was convicted in 1995 of "directing terrorism." Like
hundreds of other convicted paramilitary members, he received early
parole under the terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord. But
Britain revoked Adair's parole in August 2000, accusing him of
inspiring a feud with another banned Protestant group and scheming to
undermine the UDA's 1994 truce.</TE>

<HD>Jerusalem Would Be Shared Under Plan</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israeli official's peace proposal is one of two
presented to Labor Party committee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Three days after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's ruling Likud Party
voted to reject the establishment of a Palestinian state, Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer on Wednesday unveiled his own peace
package that would share Jerusalem with the Palestinians and grant
them sovereignty over most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The plan of Ben-Eliezer, leader of the center-left Labor Party,
differs sharply from that of Sharon, who says he supports the idea of
a Palestinian state--but at the end of a lengthy and incremental
peace process.</LD>
<LD>   Ben-Eliezer's proposal, delivered to his party's 700-member
central committee, was meant to demonstrate his differences with the
prime minister and potential challengers in his own party, according
to political analysts.</LD>
<TE>   Moments after the defense minister outlined his peace plan, Haim
Ramon, a charismatic parliament member who intends to make a bid for
Labor's leadership, presented a competing proposal calling for
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from nearly all of the West Bank and
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Ben-Eliezer's decision to distinguish himself from
Sharon was a signal that the Labor leader will soon guide his party
out of Sharon's coalition government ahead of the general election,
scheduled for November 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he has a timetable, but he's definitely laying the
groundwork toward dissolving the coalition," said Joseph Alpher, an
Israeli political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   "For Ben-Eliezer to be a viable candidate, he has no choice but to
put himself outside the government," said Uzi Baram, a former Labor
minister. "He cannot be seen as an alternative if he keeps sitting
close to Mr. Sharon."</TE>
<TE>   The competing peace plans, which were unveiled Wednesday at a
kibbutz north of Tel Aviv, also demonstrated that leadership battles
had begun inside the rival Labor and Likud parties. On Sunday, Sharon
suffered a humiliating defeat when delegates--against his
admonition--supported a proposal by his main rival, Benjamin
Netanyahu, never to accept the creation of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has laid out strict guidelines for what he said could be a
limited, demilitarized Palestinian state alongside Israel. But the
prime minister recently said he was not prepared to discuss a pullout
from Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza--a condition the
Palestinians see as essential to any peace agreement.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Ben-Eliezer, for the first time, provided details of
his peace plan. Many analysts said it resembled what former President
Clinton proposed to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat during peace talks at
Camp David in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ben-Eliezer's plan, Israel would negotiate a pullout from
most of the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis would control West Jerusalem
and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, while Palestinians would
be given control of East Jerusalem's Arab sector. The status of
Jerusalem's Old City and holy sites would be decided later by both
sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Two states for two people, living side by side in peaceful
coexistence, Israel and Palestine," Ben-Eliezer told party activists.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon urged the committee members to take "our destiny in our own
hands" and separate unilaterally from the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring that Arafat was no longer a partner for peace, Ramon
said: "There is no partner now, and neither will there be one in the
foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Party members will vote on the competing plans in July.</TE>
<TE>   Alpher and other analysts say Ben-Eliezer would have a
justification for leaving the coalition if Sharon and his fellow
hawks in Likud reject Labor's peace plan.</TE>

<HD>Turkey OKs Media Bill Criticized as Restrictive</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Opponents say it will bolster monopolies and
hurt the nation's EU bid. An official calls it 'a dark stain' on
democracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The Turkish parliament approved a controversial bill Wednesday that
critics charge will further curtail press freedoms, strengthen media
monopolies and weaken the country's bid to join the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new law, Turkey's media barons will no longer be barred
from bidding for government contracts. This, critics charge, will
make newspaper, radio and television owners more vulnerable to
government pressure as they seek to snap up lucrative projects or
acquire stakes in state-owned companies earmarked for privatization.</LD>
<LD>   The law will also require Internet sites to submit content to
government censors before it can be posted or updated. Under the
controversial provision, both Web site owners and Internet service
providers will be subject to heavy fines should content be deemed
threatening to national security, sexually explicit or libelous.</LD>
<TE>   Internet providers have protested the bill by blacking out their
home pages and shutting down their services for a day. The law "will
deal a serious blow to the Internet in Turkey," a coalition of media
and information technology groups said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "It is against the spirit of the Internet.... The result will be
like burning a blanket to catch a flea," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout Wednesday was low in parliament's 550-member chamber, with
only 292 lawmakers showing up for a stormy 10-hour session during
which opponents and sponsors of the bill frequently hurled insults
and nearly came to blows.</TE>
<TE>   Islamist opposition parties, a frequent target of the staunchly
pro-secular mainstream press, led the protest, but 202 deputies from
the three-party ruling coalition voted in favor of the bill, easily
securing its passage.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the Turkish government broadcasting watchdog agency,
who is among the most vocal critics of the bill, termed it "a dark
stain on Turkish democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "The press will become a vehicle for promoting the interests of
its owners and their allies in the government. It is a disgrace,"
said Nuri Kayis, whose agency will come under greater government
control as a result of the bill, which increases the number of
government-appointed members on its board.</TE>
<TE>   One of the law's chief beneficiaries is Aydin Dogan, a media baron
whose stable of national newspapers, television channels and
magazines rakes in more than 60% of the country's advertising
revenue. Dogan makes no secret of his desire to bid for government
contracts. In a recent interview, he vigorously defended the bill,
saying it would make media ownership more transparent and prevent it
"from falling in the hands of dangerous groups, who hide behind front
companies."</TE>
<TE>   Yilmaz Karakoyunlu, the minister in charge of broadcasting, said
the bill would be "improved" after its passage.</TE>
<TE>   But opposition lawmakers said such a move was unlikely amid
mounting speculation that the government of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit might fall, forcing early parliamentary elections. What the
new law fails to change are existing bans on certain Kurdish-language
broadcasts it considers separatist. Owners of numerous radio and
television channels in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeastern
provinces have been frequently fined and their broadcasts banned for
airing Kurdish music.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union is demanding that Turkey lift such bans as one
of the conditions for beginning membership negotiations with the
Ankara government. An EU spokesman said the bill was "a step back"
for democratic reforms in Turkey. Turkey's president, Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, vetoed the bill when it was first approved by the parliament
last year. But under the constitution, he is powerless to block it a
second time and can only appeal for its annulment by the courts.</TE>

<HD>Cable Pioneer John Rigas Quits Under Fire as Adelphia CEO</HD>
<DH>Media: Dissident shareholders complain that family will
still control troubled firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John J. Rigas, who used $300 from an overdrawn bank account to build
the Adelphia Communications Corp. cable TV empire, resigned under
fire Wednesday as chairman, chief executive and president of the
company he ran for half a century amid pressures from unhappy
shareholders, deteriorating finances and government probes into the
company's accounting and loan practices.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron-like accounting controversy at Adelphia and Rigas'
resignation set off speculation that Adelphia might have to file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia's latest problems, which include an internal probe into
several Rigas family transactions, also could delay a proposed sale
of many of its cable operations, including its prized Southern
California cable systems, which serve 1.2million subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   The company already has announced plans to sell up to half its
cable systems nationwide to slash its staggering debt. Adelphia is
Los Angeles' largest cable provider and operates systems in some of
the most desirable areas, including Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica,
Brentwood, Arcadia, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the deeply religious Rigas, 77, said his decision
to leave Adelphia came "after much thought and prayer." He added that
Adelphia "needs fresh, independent leadership" to restore its
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But dissident shareholders said Rigas' resignation doesn't go far
enough because he and his three sons will continue serving on
Adelphia's board and the family still controls the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe essentially nothing has changed," said Scott
Schneider, vice chairman of Citizens Communications, which is
controlled by dissident shareholder Leonard Tow.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas' abrupt resignation tarnishes the 50-year career of one of
cable's pioneers, a veteran of World War II who went into the
business in 1952. Rigas bought a movie theater and small cable
franchise in the tiny northern Pennsylvania town of Coudersport,
using the $300 he overdrew from his bank account.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, as a wave of consolidation swept the cable
industry, involving such media giants as AOL Time Warner Inc., AT&amp;T
Corp. and billionaire Paul Allen, Adelphia was seen as a throwback to
the industry's earlier entrepreneurial days.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas and his sons continued running Adelphia as a family
enterprise. Despite its being a multibillion-dollar operation, Rigas
kept Adelphia based in Coudersport.</TE>
<TE>   Even when his Adelphia stock made him a billionaire, Rigas was on
a first-name basis with many of the town's 3,000 residents, who
viewed him as a benevolent hero. As the company's problems mounted in
the last six weeks, local residents formed "prayer chains" at
churches and flooded Rigas' office with flowers and potted plants.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, Don Gilliland, managing editor of the Potter
County Leader-Enterprise in Coudersport, said, "People are feeling
pretty grim."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's problems continued to mount almost daily since late
March, when the company disclosed that that it had guaranteed at
least $2.3 billion in loans to Rigas family partnerships without
showing them on Adelphia's balance sheet. Wall Street has been wary
of any company using off-balance-sheet financing practices since the
collapse in December of Enron Corp. and the accounting scandal
involving Enron's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, Adelphia's shareholders have watched the
company's stock lose more than 85% of its value, with its overall
market value plunging by $6 billion. The company recently said it
probably would have to restate its earnings for the last three years
and it would consolidate $1.6billion of the partnership loans on
Adelphia's books. Adelphia's debt disclosure prompted an
investigation last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   News of Rigas' resignation drove down Adelphia stock to an
all-time low Wednesday morning, causing Nasdaq to suspend its
trading. The stock did not open for trading on Nasdaq but nonetheless
slid to $3.30 a share, down $2.40, in so-called third-market trading.
The company's bonds also fell about 20 cents to 70 cents on the
dollar. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded Adelphia's bonds to one of
its lowest corporate ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia announced that veteran banker Erland E. Kailbourne, an
independent director, will take over as interim CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the developments also raised questions about the
relationship between Adelphia and accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche,
which audits Adelphia and the Rigas family's partnerships. Deloitte
executives could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said they have been uncomfortable with signing off on
some of Adelphia's financial statements after unearthing questionable
deals involving the company.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has threatened to delist Adelphia for failing to file its
annual report by an extended deadline last month. Adelphia has
scheduled a hearing for today about the delisting. Nasdaq declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said it hired as an advisor high-powered lawyer David
Boies, who headed the government's Microsoft Corp. antitrust case and
led Al Gore's legal battles in the Florida election recount. Adelphia
added that an audit by Deloitte &amp; Touche was being suspended pending
an investigation by Boies.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the Boies investigation will delay Adelphia's annual
report filing, causing the company's stock to be delisted and thus
triggering defaults on its loans. If so, that could force Adelphia to
file for bankruptcy protection and could delay a proposed sale of as
much of half of the company's cable operations to ease its crushing
debt. The formal auction process began Wednesday, when prospective
buyers received information packets from Adelphia with information on
which systems will be available for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Rigas family used the public company as collateral to
borrow money for the partnerships, Adelphia shareholders are on the
hook for the additional debt, used largely to purchase Adelphia
stock. Adelphia and the Rigas family now face more than 18
shareholder lawsuits for securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have predicted a liquidity crunch at Adelphia since the
company revealed the off-balance-sheet loans. Adelphia relies on bank
credit lines for operating cash and burns through an estimated
$1billion a year to run the company. Analysts say the delisting
probably will trip bank agreements, putting the company into
technical default with its lenders.</TE>
<TE>   "If these defaults happen, then what do they do for money?" said
Richard Siderman, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, which downgraded
Adelphia bonds Wednesday from CCC-plus to CCC-minus, one of the
lowest corporate debt ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas' resignation failed to placate dissident shareholder Tow.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Adelphia bought Tow's Century Communications Corp., which
operated cable systems in Los Angeles, for $3.6 billion in cash and
debt. The move doubled Adelphia's size and also marked a change from
its usual small and mid-size cable markets. The deal also further
loaded Adelphia with debt, which totaled $15billion according to a
preliminary balance sheet issued in March.</TE>
<TE>   Tow said earlier this week that he would exercise his contractual
right to place three directors, including himself, on Adelphia's
board.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Kailbourne on Wednesday, Tow suggested that he
would aggressively press ahead to wield his influence at Adelphia.
Tow said he was disappointed that Kailbourne ignored his right to put
his directors on the board. Tow gave Adelphia until Friday afternoon
to comply or he "will pursue all appropriate remedies."</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources say a liquidity crisis at Adelphia could further
delay its effort to upgrade its L.A. cable networks. The company is
behind schedule in rolling out new services, such as high-speed
Internet access.</TE>

<HD>An Apology to 'My Brother Priests'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is the text of a letter Tuesday from Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to
all priests in the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   May 14, 2002</LD>
<LD>   My Brother Priests:</LD>
<TE>   We have all been overwhelmed for many weeks now with the constant
publicity highlighting the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests
all across the country. These news reports have been very distressing
for us all, but these reports have helped us turn our prayers and our
focus to reaching out to the victims with all available spiritual and
pastoral assistance.</TE>
<TE>   It is quite likely that very soon the public media will highlight
the case of Michael Baker, a former priest of this archdiocese. You
need to be aware that such a story could come anytime now, and you
need to be aware of the seriousness of his case.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in late 1986, Baker disclosed to me that he had problems
in the past of acting out sexually with two minors.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was sent to a treatment center for evaluation and
recommendation for his future. Following treatment, it was decided
that he could do specialized priestly ministry not related to
children and youth. He was subsequently given various ministries,
such as special outreach to our retired priests. All during this
time, we had no reports of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the year 2000 we learned that two men in Arizona were
preparing to sue Baker for past sexual abuse. Once we became aware of
that situation, he was removed immediately from all priestly ministry
in accordance with the policy in effect at that time. Baker agreed to
petition the Holy See for laicization, which was granted shortly
thereafter. We have now learned that further allegations are being
made against Baker.</TE>
<TE>   As your archbishop, I assume full responsibility for allowing
Baker to remain in any type of ministry during the 1990s. If I had
known in those years what I discovered in early 2000, I would have
dismissed him from all ministry and requested his dismissal from the
priesthood in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   I offer my sincere, personal apologies for my failure to take firm
and decisive action much earlier. If I have caused you or your
parishioners additional grief by my handling of the Baker case, I ask
your forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Such situations illustrate vividly and clearly the reason why our
archdiocese now has firmly in place a "zero tolerance" policy--past,
present and future. No one who has been determined to have sexually
abused a minor can be allowed to serve in any ministry in the church.</TE>
<TE>   I ask your continued prayers as we move through this time of
purification.</TE>
<TE>   Fraternally yours in Christ,</TE>
<TE>   His Eminence</TE>

<HD>Mailroom Meltdown at Library of Congress</HD>
<DH>Security: As the Postal Service uses irradiation to combat
possible anthrax, photos and videos are arriving burned or ruined.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At the Library of Congress, the fight against terrorism has left a
bit of a mess.</LD>
<LD>   Lyrics and tunes submitted for copyright protection by a musician
in Texas dreaming of a big hit are melted into a jellyfish-like mass,
their Spanish words quieted by damage.</LD>
<LD>   Photographs of potentially historic value are fused onto cover
sheets where the caption ink has melted off, making them impossible
to decipher or preserve.</LD>
<TE>   A videotape of an oral history interview conducted for a special
project to capture the memories of war veterans is not playable.</TE>
<TE>   The culprit? Irradiation, the kind postal authorities have been
using for mail sent to certain Capitol Hill ZIP Codes since anthrax
sent through the mail--including to two U.S. senators--killed five
people last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The process of zapping the mail is so intense--postal officials
originally used an irradiation level 25 times greater than that used
to kill bacteria on beef--that letters routinely arrive yellowed,
crinkled and sometimes burned beyond recognition. Even though the
thermostat has since been turned down to a mere 10 times the normal
zap, the mail is being cooked at temperatures as great as 170
degrees, and damage is noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   "The letters look like they're about 125 years old," said Jeff
Guide, a top administrator at the Library of Congress. "If there was
cellophane on the envelope, it's disappeared, melted away."</TE>
<TE>   Few are crying over burned, wrinkled mail in government offices.
Most letters or invoices are legible, and the truth is that many
constituents and vendors, mindful of the anthrax scare, have switched
to e-mail and faxes.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the material sent to the Library of
Congress--irradiated because the building is connected by tunnel to
the House and Senate ventilation systems--is destined for the
collections or is submitted for a copyright. Officials are gearing up
to contact those who sent in now-damaged material in the hope that
they have copies.</TE>
<TE>   Postal authorities, who did not return calls to discuss the
problems at the library, now reportedly are X-raying packages, as
they do for anything sent with Federal Express or UPS, rather than
irradiating them, which they are continuing for letters. "We're back
on track now," said Peggy Bulger, director of the Library's American
Folk Life Center. "But there was a brief period when I don't think
anybody knew irradiation was quite as caustic as it was."</TE>
<TE>   The library still is in the early stages of assessing damage, in
part because of lengthy delays in processing the irradiated mail,
which is trucked to Bridgeport, N.J., for irradiation, then aired out
back in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Guide, the library's point man for the postal problems, estimates
that 3 million pieces of mail are missing. Mail bins in 12
tractor-trailers, some dating to November and December, have yet to
be delivered and examined, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Librarians face a daunting task of sorting through the mail--a
normal day brings 22,000 items--and then contacting publishers,
authors, musicians, filmmakers and donors to seek duplicates of what
is mangled, melted or missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have a lot of volume yet, but my staff is now trained
to assess damage," said Nancy Davenport, director of acquisitions for
the library.</TE>
<TE>   Even if items survive the irradiation process intact, Davenport
and her staff are marking them as irradiated--for history's sake.</TE>
<TE>   "The journals and serials that have yellowed and embrittled look
as if you left the Sunday newspaper in the sun," she said. "The
moisture is sucked out. We are marking each item in case we ever
discover a way to re-humidify them later."</TE>
<TE>   The Copyright Office, which in its 132-year history has issued
copyrights for everything from Mark Twain novels to the Ken and
Barbie dolls, has asked Congress for an emergency bridge
appropriation of $7.5 million to make up for the shortfall in $30
registration fees paid by those who are seeking copyright protection
for their works.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Dizard, who directs the Copyright Office, said the library
did not want to furlough any employees while it waits for the mail.
And Davenport reports that her costs of acquiring items for the
collection--for which the library pays postage--have risen
dramatically, given the increased use of FedEx and other services.</TE>
<TE>   But the greater costs could be in lost materials.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen McCulloch-Lovell, who directs the American Folk Life Center
project to record the memories of veterans of World War I, World War
II, and the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars, says only one
videotape has so far shown up in unusable condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great relief," she said. "Of all the things we've gotten,
only a few were crisp, and only one videotape was affected. We're not
alarmed."</TE>
<TE>   But in an irony lost on no one, irradiation affected another
project launched by the Folk Life Center: recording and assembling
Americans' reactions to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Students at Michigan State University sent in six computer discs
of photographs recording memorials they witnessed and 10 taped
interviews they conducted in East Lansing. The photo discs have been
replaced, but eight of the nine students neglected to make copies of
their interviews, leaving the melted mess part of the library's
database of the country's encounter with terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Tribal Rift Is a Matter of Blood</HD>
<DH>Politics: A tense standoff marked the battle of two
Seminoles over who will head the nation. Big gambling money is at
stake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEMINOLE, Okla.</DL>
<LD>It was blood and money that fractured the Seminole nation and started
the siege. A tense battle of wills between two men--each of whom
swears he is the rightful head of the 12,000-member Seminole
nation--paralyzed this smattering of gambling halls and old meeting
grounds for more than a week.</LD>
<LD>   Longtime chief Jerry Haney is recognized by the U.S. government,
even though he lost the last election by a wide margin. His wildly
popular foe, Kenneth Chambers, has managed to cling to power ever
since he triumphed in a racially charged and illegal election last
summer.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides spent the last week staring each other down across a
country road--neither wanted to relinquish the tribal buildings he
had seized. Threats gave way to physical scuffles. Haney backed down
late Tuesday, and tensions were easing slightly. The bustling casinos
and shops reopened Wednesday night after having been closed for days.</LD>
<TE>   "This has devastated our nation; it's one of the lowest points in
our history," said Michael Haney. A pigtailed supporter and relative
of Jerry Haney, Michael Haney pored over court orders in a smoky
backroom of the tribal mission last weekend. "It's family against
family. Our morale is broken."</TE>
<TE>   The two factions can't even agree on what started what Haney calls
"this war--I mean, this conflict." It was a long-simmering racial
split that brought the Seminoles into chaos--but it's a thirst for
power and self-determination that lends the standoff its stubborn
longevity. The two men stand to gain plenty: 150 years after the U.S.
government pushed their ancestors out of Florida and onto the wilds
of the Oklahoma prairies, the Seminole nation is worth millions of
dollars and controls a burgeoning betting industry.</TE>
<TE>   Things got messy two years ago, when the tribal council agreed to
strip away the voting rights of approximately 2,000 black Seminoles.
The so-called Freedmen are slaves' descendants who have coexisted and
mingled with the indigenous "blood Seminoles" for decades.</TE>
<TE>   To indigenous Seminoles, the change in blood requirement was a
stroke of self-determination. To the black Seminoles, it was a
painful crack at their culture.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is just really, really heavy that these folks have so
much hatred when their own ancestors did not have it," black Seminole
Lena J. Hunt Shaw said. "People of African descent played a major
role, I mean a major role, in helping those Indians survive.
Everybody has the blood in them."</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Indian Affairs failed to return numerous phone calls
for this story, but the U.S. government appears to agree with Shaw.
The federal agency regards the disenfranchisement of the Freedmen as
an illegal maneuver, a constitutional amendment that took place
without the needed approval of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. All
tribal council business that fell after the decision to oust the
black Seminoles is nullified, the bureau has told the Seminole
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   That includes the August election of Chambers, who spent this past
week holed up in the tribal compound in blatant defiance of a tribal
court order. As dusk gave way to torrential rain this weekend in the
tiny town of Wewoka, children raced in the corridors. Old men in work
boots rested against the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The families who stayed loyal to Chambers lived on hot corn stew
and sandwich cookies delivered by the tribal elders. They slept in
cars and tents pitched in the grass; they took turns standing sentry.
No matter what, they said, they would not leave.</TE>
<TE>   And as it turned out, they didn't have to. The siege ended late
Tuesday, when a tribal appeals panel overturned the order that had
banned Chambers from the Seminole offices. The panel ruled that a
tribal judge had overstepped his authority when he froze the tribe's
bank accounts and disarmed the Lighthorsemen, the Seminole police.</TE>
<TE>   But the bitter fight over Seminole leadership still has the nation
crackling with tension. The federal government will continue trying
to force the Seminoles to hold a new election--and count the votes of
the Freedmen. Federal programs have ground to a stop, one by one, for
months: meals for elderly, Head Start, transportation to and from
dialysis treatments. Graduates have been unable to pin down
scholarship funds; families have applied for emergency food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   "People are getting hurt physically, they're getting hurt
financially," Chambers supporter Marsey Harjo said. "Oh, yeah. It's
hit us hard."</TE>
<TE>   Chambers says he has no ethical choice but to defy the U.S.
government and the Haney group. He says it's a question of
sovereignty, not race. His followers are fighting for the right to
decide who is and is not Seminole, to pen their own constitution, and
to pick their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a sovereign nation. Our government was here before the U.S.
government," Chambers said. "If we hold our ground we'll win."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Haney was chief for 12 years before losing to Chambers. The
U.S. government says he's still in charge, and Haney agrees. He and a
handful of followers spent last week hunkered down in the Mekusukey
tribal grounds, a high, breezy stretch of land with a meeting hall
and a wide view of the rolling pastures below. They have the formal
recognition of federal authorities--and not much else. Chambers
sneers at them and calls them stooges for a meddling U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday night's ruling restored guns to the Lighthorsemen,
Haney fled the meeting hall and took refuge in his house. The tribal
police remain loyal to Chambers, and Haney feared an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was going to come to a physical confrontation, and we
don't need that," Haney said. "I vacated peacefully."</TE>
<TE>   For days, Chambers' men hunched in folding chairs at the threshold
of the Seminole bingo hall across the street from the Haney group.
The two factions sat stolidly, glowering at their foes through
binoculars, each one silently daring the other to cross the road.
When a Chambers supporter crossed, a melee broke out. Rick Deer ended
up in the hospital, beaten bloody by a crowd that included his
cousin. Three people were arrested by Bureau of Indian Affairs
agents, the only law enforcement allowed on tribal property.</TE>
<TE>   Although the leaders insist they were fighting for freedom, not
race, the men on sentry this week told a different tale.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not black--we're Indians," said blood Seminole Yogi Harjo,
who drove out from Oklahoma City to help Chambers stake out the bingo
hall. His hair is woven into three braids; an eagle feather flaps
from the back of his Hilfiger cap. "We're trying to keep the black
people out."</TE>
<TE>   The origin of the black Seminoles is a point of dispute. Some of
the tribe say the bloods and blacks banded together for protection
back in the days before the United States shoved the Seminoles out of
Florida. Others say the Seminoles kept slaves, who were freed and
granted citizenship after the Civil War. Most likely, the truth is
somewhere in between, says University of Oklahoma Native American
studies professor Jerry C. Bread.</TE>
<TE>   "But [the Seminole standoff] is really not a matter of race; it's
a matter of politics and the right of the people to define their own
blood," Bread said. "This is just the beginning of a trend that we'll
see across the country. How far do we go in allowing the U.S.
government to dictate the rights that we have?"</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has said the black Seminoles have been members
since the tribe signed an 1866 treaty and can't be kicked out without
the approval of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The move to oust the black Seminoles came just as tribal politics
became high-stakes. The federal government had paid the Seminoles
back for the loss of Florida with a $35-million settlement. The
advent of bingo halls and slot machines dropped millions of dollars
into tribal coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ethnic cleansing, revisionist history," said Jonathon Velie,
a lawyer for the Freedmen. "They're out of control."</TE>

<HD>Enron Memos May Signal End to Energy Cease-Fire</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats gear up for new conflict with the
White House over pricing. The documents show 'something was rotten,'
Sen. Boxer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The new charges of electricity market manipulation against Enron
Corp. are rekindling the energy wars between California Democrats and
the Bush administration--though with a very different tone than
during last year's power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery of internal Enron memos detailing schemes to inflate
electricity prices in California and other Western states has ended
the truce between the two sides that began in June when federal
regulators reluctantly imposed limited price caps on the electricity
market.</LD>
<LD>   That decision defused an intense conflict between California Gov.
Gray Davis and the White House. But now the stage is set for a second
round of conflicts.</LD>
<TE>   At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Wednesday, California
officials made it clear that they will use the memos to intensify
pressure on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant them
billions of dollars in relief and extend the price caps past their
expiration date this fall. "These memos prove what I and many members
of our delegation have been saying for almost two years now:
Something was rotten," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said at the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The early sparring hasn't been as vitriolic as last year's
conflict over the price caps--largely because Patrick H. Wood III,
President Bush's appointee as FERC chairman, has established better
relations than his predecessor with California officials and consumer
advocates. Optimistic that Wood may grant some of his demands,
insiders say Davis appears to have made a conscious decision to
court, rather than confront, FERC.</TE>
<TE>   "From the purely policy level, the calculation seems to be we can
get what we need from this guy and it's not worth the risk to pick a
big public fight," said one California Democrat close to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But the tension could increase if FERC doesn't provide Davis all
the relief he's requesting, which it seems unlikely to do. "We would
prefer not to have an antagonistic relationship [with FERC], and so
far we haven't,'' Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said. "But if
push comes to shove, Californians come first."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's hearing marked the sharpest conflict over energy
between California officials and the Bush administration since FERC's
decision to impose the price caps. After that decision, electricity
prices in the state plummeted and California avoided the summer of
brownouts many experts feared.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, California officials repeatedly argued
that the Enron memos, which detailed a variety of complex strategies
to drive up electricity prices, proved they had been right in blaming
the state's electricity crisis on lax federal oversight of the energy
market.</TE>
<TE>   "With the publication of the Enron memos, none of us can hide from
a basic truth: The California energy crisis has never been about
supply or demand or any other set of economic fundamentals," said
Loretta M. Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities
Commission. "It has been about a complete lack of appropriate
enforcement, and lax or nonexistent federal regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the high-octane rhetoric from Lynch and Boxer,
observers said that David Freeman, Davis' appointee as chairman of
the California Power Commission, conspicuously praised Wood in his
testimony. And the California Democrat close to the Davis
administration noted that the governor reduced the temperature at the
hearing by deciding not to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "The political component of this is [Davis] can use the new
[Enron] memos both as a sword to really go on the offensive and
aggressively pursue an issue on behalf of the people of California
and a shield to defend himself against criticism that his leadership
was partially responsible for the electricity crisis," the Democrat
said. "But he recognizes that Wood at the end of the day is going to
make these decisions, so the thought process is you continue to work
with him."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the Enron memos, Davis and other California
officials now are pressing three principal demands on FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Wood was most encouraging Wednesday about the state's request for
action to restrain electricity prices after the price caps expire
Sept. 30. Wood signaled--to some skepticism from Democratic
senators--that FERC would find a mechanism to prevent price spikes.
"We are not going to go from what we have now to something that is
less effective," he said. "It is not like an on or off switch."</TE>
<TE>   Wood was less definitive on a second Davis demand: a request for
nearly $9 billion in refunds to the state from power companies.
Privately, one senior administration official said he was expecting
FERC would issue a "pretty substantial refund order." But in his
testimony, Freeman complained, "The process is moving at a snail's
pace."</TE>
<TE>   On the third demand, FERC is considering a request from California
to order power suppliers to renegotiate $43 billion in long-term
contracts they signed with the state. Davis is arguing that the Enron
memos prove that manipulation of the electricity market forced the
state to pay excessive prices.</TE>
<TE>   Wood gave no indication of his leaning on that question, and some
insiders believe FERC may be reluctant to force the reopening of the
contracts. The senior administration official said that "FERC ...,
just like Congress, has not been quick to break contracts." The
official added that reopening the California deals might create a
ripple effect that forces the renegotiation of energy contracts
across the West.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson Slocum, research director for the energy program at Public
Citizen, a consumer group, said Davis may be betting too much on
influencing Wood. But Davis aides insist that, if FERC resists, they
are prepared to escalate the political conflict with the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC is a political animal like everyone else in Washington, and
they will feel the heat from this, just as they did when they ordered
the price caps," Maviglio said.</TE>

<HD>Blaze in Arizona Burns 800 Acres</HD>
<DH>Destruction: The wind-whipped wildfire destroys six homes
as it moves toward Prescott. The governor declares a state of
emergency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PRESCOTT, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A fast-moving wildfire charred more than 800 acres Wednesday on the
fringe of this mile-high city, destroying six homes and forcing
residents to flee, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which grew rapidly as it was whipped by strong winds,
burned toward Prescott from the city's southern edge into late
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a bad situation up there," said Francie Noyes, a
spokeswoman for Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who declared a state of
emergency.</LD>
<TE>   Hull said, "The wind is going in absolutely the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   But the fire began to slow down as night fell, giving firefighters
a chance to move in closer to attack the blaze, said Steve Sams, a
spokesman for the Prescott National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Officials didn't know how many people were forced to leave, but
Prescott Police Department spokesman Steve Skurja said, "We're
talking a couple thousand people."</TE>
<TE>   The fire began Wednesday in the Prescott National Forest south of
Prescott, a city of 33,000 about 90 miles north of Phoenix. Many
homes are built in the surrounding forest.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing happened really fast," said Skurja. "It was clear as a
bell, and all of a sudden we were covered in smoke."</TE>
<TE>   He said slurry planes buzzed over the city for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Doreen Parker and her fiance, who live in a townhouse about a mile
from the fire, said they were prepared to leave if the fire moved
closer.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like sitting ducks here," Parker said. "We have our bags
packed. There's no possible way we can collect all our valuables, but
we've got clothes and all the necessary documents. I'm watching
firetrucks go right by my window."</TE>
<TE>   About 300 people were gathered at Prescott Mile High Middle
School, and more were expected, said Kevin Kapp, superintendent of
the Prescott Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Kapp said he had an hour to get home, meet his wife and get
pictures and other important items out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day when I come out of my house, as dry as it's been, I
say, 'I hope this is not the day.' Unfortunately, today is the day,"
Kapp said.</TE>
<TE>   Sams said the cause of the wildfire was not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   Five air tankers and a helicopter battled the blaze at one point
and more crews were coming in today, according to Sams.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was one of three burning Wednesday in Arizona, which is
experiencing a severe drought. Northern Arizona had its driest fall
and winter in more than 100 years, according to the National Weather
Service.</TE>
<TE>   An 840-acre wildfire in the Coconino National Forest was 60%
contained by Wednesday evening, said fire spokeswoman Connie
Birkland.</TE>
<TE>   She said about 150 firefighters were working on that blaze with no
immediate estimate for full containment or control.</TE>
<TE>   No homes were threatened by the blaze, which was in the Clints
Well area about 20 miles north of Payson, according to Birkland.</TE>
<TE>   The Hart fire reported Wednesday morning west of the San Francisco
Peaks near Flagstaff was fully contained at 60 acres by nightfall,
Birkland said.</TE>

<HD>To Gain Entry, One Need Only Change the World</HD>
<DH>Science: The National Inventors Hall of Fame adds eight
members today, honoring them in a society that takes them for
granted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Sometimes, when retired ceramics engineer Irwin Lachman sees the cars
buzz past his Santa Rosa home, his mind races back to the old
laboratory and all those crazy experiments.</LD>
<LD>   In 1975, Lachman helped invent the catalytic converter, a device
that removes toxins from automobile exhaust. Decades later, he still
recalls the hundreds of misguided attempts before he and two
co-creators--in a quest to perfect a honeycomb design--could claim
that they'd finally gotten it right.</LD>
<LD>   "It's amazing, when you stop to think about it," said Lachman, 71.
"The catalytic converter has cut pollution by 3 billion tons
worldwide and 1.5 billion tons in the U.S. alone. But it took a lot
of work to find the solution. I think successful inventions come from
keeping your mind open. If you don't, you can easily overlook answers
right there in front of your face."</LD>
<TE>   Lachman's creation is standard equipment in millions of vehicles
worldwide, yet the career inventor has gained all the public standing
of an obscure answer on some board game trivia quiz.</TE>
<TE>   But officials from the National Inventors Hall of Fame say
Lachman's two long years in a Corning, N.Y., lab should account for
something, some small nod of respect from the public at large.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in a ceremony at Hewlett-Packard Co. headquarters in Palo
Alto, the Ohio-based nonprofit hall of fame will announce its 30th
class of inventors, this year recognizing Lachman and seven other
inductees whose contributions range from everyday aspirin and the
automobile seat belt to laser surgery and the implantable
defibrillator, which helps prevent sudden cardiac arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The award doesn't mean instant marquee status. Winners receive a
medal and recognition at the hall of fame's museum in Akron, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   But officials hope the award shines a spotlight, even briefly, on
this eclectic and overlooked lot--the itinerant tinkerers and
blackboard scribblers who dream up the newfangled contraptions and
remarkable technological breakthroughs that society mostly takes for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   "People know the gadgets that are part of our everyday life, but
they don't know the name of the person who came up with the idea,"
said Donald Keck, an inventor and hall of fame president. "For some
reason, inventors aren't celebrities in our society."</TE>
<TE>   To date, 168 inventors have been recognized, often posthumously,
by the hall. They include the famous, from Thomas Edison (the light
bulb) and Eli Whitney (the cotton gin) to John Deere (the common
plow) and Willis Carrier (air-conditioning), to the obscure, such as
William Lear (the car radio), Willson Greatbatch (the pacemaker) and
Andrew Moyer (the mass production of penicillin).</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the U.S. Patent Office in Washington issues 175,000
patents from 360,000 applications. A new patent is issued, on
average, every six minutes, but only a few ever hit the marketplace,
let alone enter the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the wings are such longshots as the edible tie pin, the
bed-wetting alarm, the heated ice cream scoop, the gravity-powered
shoe air-conditioner and the combined earthquake sensor and night
light.</TE>
<TE>   Requirements for a U.S. patent specify that an idea must be "new,
usable and not obvious." But officials say the real work for an
inventor often begins after the government's stamp of approval is
issued.</TE>
<TE>   "You may come up with a wonderful idea, but so many people don't
do their homework and devise a marketing and business plan," said
Ruth Nyblod, a spokeswoman for the patent office.</TE>
<TE>   The patents themselves are also expensive--costing about $4,000,
excluding attorney's fees.</TE>
<TE>   "The inventions come from every sector of society," said James
Rogan, the Bush administration's undersecretary of Commerce and
director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which co-founded
the Inventors Hall of Fame in 1973. "They come from college labs and
from garages. They arrive as CD-ROMs and scrawled on paper bags with
pencils and crayon."</TE>
<TE>   The youngest inventor to receive a patent is a 4-year-old Houston
girl whose parents say she devised a Houdini-like way to get inside
child-proofed doors and cabinets. The patented device could be used
to help people with arthritis better grip objects.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how absurd an application might seem, the office
professes to take each one seriously. "But some of them do make us
laugh," Nyblod said.</TE>
<TE>   Those would include the underwater golf swing training device, the
urinal that tells users when they're missing the mark, the grooming
aid that gauges the exact desired length of a necktie and the fly
swatter with sound effects.</TE>
<TE>   Entry into the Inventors Hall of Fame is a bit more exacting and
usually requires that a device has somehow changed society.</TE>
<TE>   This year's winners include Nils Bohlin, a Volvo engineer who in
1962 invented the three-point automobile seat belt, and the late
Felix Hoffman, who in 1899 patented aspirin after experimenting to
find a way to alleviate his father's arthritis pain.</TE>
<TE>   Past inductees include Charles Kettering, who in 1909 patented the
automobile ignition; John Ericsson for his 1839 patent of the
propeller and Douglas Engelbart, who in 1968 patented the
now-ubiquitous computer mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Also included is George Mestral, who in 1955 patented Velcro. "He
stumbled across his invention one day after he went hunting and found
all these burdocks attached to his clothing," recalls Keck, 61, a
1993 inductee for inventing the low-loss optical fiber in
telecommunication and computer technology.</TE>
<TE>   "He put the burdocks under the microscope to see how they affixed
themselves to his pants. Then he reproduced the effect with man-made
materials."</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Kurzweil in 1976 accomplished another breakthrough when he
patented the Kurzweil Reading Machine, which scans printed material
and is considered the most significant advancement for the blind
since Braille.</TE>
<TE>   The MIT graduate, another inductee this year, says it wasn't all
smooth sailing for his machine, even after receiving his patent.</TE>
<TE>   After being featured by Walter Cronkite on his news broadcast,
Kurzweil was to demonstrate his contraption live on the "Today" show.
But the machine broke down shortly before air time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our chief engineer took the thing apart--there were parts strewn
all over the place--and some nervous TV guy came up and asked if
there was any problem, and we said 'No, no. We're just making some
last-minute adjustments.'"</TE>
<TE>   Just before the show began, the engineer slammed it on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "It started working right off," recalls Kurzweil. "And that taught
us all an important lesson: Technology often has a mind of its own."</TE>

<HD>Tape of Klansmen Is Played at Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: FBI's recording captures a discussion of the deaths
of four black girls at church in 1963.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>There they were, three Klansmen--Bobby Frank Cherry, Thomas E.
Blanton Jr., Mitchell Burns--driving around this angry city on a
March night in 1965.</LD>
<LD>   They were bashing the FBI, wearing out racial slurs, talking about
bombs, when someone blurted: "So then they [FBI agents] asked me
where were y'all when the bomb went off. And I told them: 'We were
trying to make ours for the weekend and find a good spot.'"</LD>
<LD>   The men laughed. But one of them was faking it. Burns was an
informant for the FBI collecting evidence against Blanton and Cherry
in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, which killed
four black girls. He had a reel-to-reel tape deck in his trunk.</LD>
<TE>   But 37 years later, as the murder case against Cherry unfolds tape
by scratchy tape in a much-changed Birmingham, it's not clear how
much evidence there ever was.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of the tapes played Wednesday was so bad, it was
difficult to understand what was said and who was saying it.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt Cherry, now 71, used to run with a violent crowd
and detested integration down to the last nerve in his body. But so
far there's been little direct proof that he helped plan, build or
deliver the bomb, which produced one of the most infamous attacks of
the civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   On the trial's second day, prosecutors spent the morning focusing
on technical aspects of the blast. Many jurors looked tired as
explosives experts talked projectile velocity and refractive indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite extensive lab work and even modern-day simulations, none
of the forensic tests was conclusive, said FBI bomb investigator
Charles L. Killion. He was one of the agents who picked through the
rubble and scraped blackened windowsills for residue hours after the
church was bombed on Sept. 15, 1963.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, Mr. Killion, you have no conclusions about the type of
explosives used, do you?" asked defense lawyer Mickey Johnson in an
ornery cross-examination.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Killion said, "We don't."</TE>
<TE>   An interesting twist came when Killion, a prosecution witness,
poked a hole in the long-held theory of how the bomb was set.</TE>
<TE>   Blanton and another Klansman, Robert Chambliss, already have been
convicted in the bombing, and in both cases prosecutors said the men
planted the bomb at the church the night before and rigged it with a
timing device.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, Killion said that theory was "illogical." There
were too many people around the church who could have discovered the
bomb, he said, and it was more likely the device was left "one or two
hours" before the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Burns testified Wednesday that Cherry told him "he lied all the
way through" to FBI investigators and that FBI agents "think we made
the bomb somewhere else." Neither comment was recorded.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to understand Cherry on the tapes, but one comment was
unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about what he would like to do to trouble-making blacks,
Cherry said: "George Wallace [then governor of Alabama] said on TV to
use any force necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last another week.</TE>

<HD>Dismissal of Most Lindh Counts Urged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh had a constitutional right to associate with Al
Qaeda and another U.S.-identified terrorist group, his lawyers argued
Wednesday in seeking dismissal of most counts in his indictment.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of 10 counts amount to guilt by association because there's
no proof that Lindh intended to further illegal aims of the two
organizations, the written motion said.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh's defense team has filed a series of pleadings this week
that, together, seek dismissal of the entire case against the former
Taliban infantryman.</LD>
<TE>   He is accused of conspiring to murder U.S. nationals, providing
support to foreign terrorist organizations and using firearms during
crimes of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the counts carry maximum life sentences, and the others
have combined penalties totaling 90 years' imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   "Central to 1st Amendment freedoms is the right to associate with
unpopular and disfavored groups," said the written motion.</TE>
<TE>   The motion asserted the U.S. Supreme Court, at least five times,
has held that an individual cannot constitutionally be punished based
solely on association with an organization.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment does not allege that Mr. Lindh provided Al Qaeda
with anything," the motion said.</TE>

<HD>CBS Defends Airing Parts of Pearl Videotape</HD>
<DH>Media: The network says it wanted to show the terrorists'
'gruesome' propaganda. The slain reporter's family calls the decision
'heartless.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>CBS News on Wednesday defended its decision to air a brief excerpt of
a videotape made by captors of slain Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl, despite criticism from Pearl's family, who called the
move "heartless" and said they "had hoped that no part of this tape
would ever see the light of day."</LD>
<LD>   The Tuesday night broadcast on "CBS Evening News" became a hot
topic for talk-radio hosts, and CBS said it received "several dozen"
complaints from viewers, along with a lesser number of messages of
support.</LD>
<LD>   CBS aired the video excerpts as part of a report on what CBS
anchor Dan Rather called a "gruesome piece of propaganda" that is
circulating on the Internet and being used by terrorists as a
recruitment tool.</LD>
<TE>   The recruiting video includes more scenes from the Pearl tape than
CBS chose to show. CBS said it didn't air the video's most graphic
scenes for "reasons of decency and out of respect for Mr. Pearl's
family."</TE>
<TE>   The CBS report showed Pearl, under duress, saying he was Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared in January in Pakistan while reporting. His
death was confirmed in a February videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's parents and sisters and his widow, Mariane, said in a
statement after the broadcast, "While Dan Rather attempts to
rationalize the network's heartless decision to air this despicable
'terrorist propaganda video,' it is beyond our comprehension that any
mother, wife, father or sister should have to relive this horrific
tragedy and watch their loved one being repeatedly terrorized."</TE>
<TE>   The Journal said in a statement that it "made it clear yesterday
to CBS that we believed no good purpose would be served by showing
any part of this video. That remains our view."</TE>
<TE>   CBS was also asked by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's office
and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's office not to air the video.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Murphy, executive producer of "CBS Evening News," said he
understands "the family's point of view because the family is bound
to feel the way they feel." But he said he didn't understand the
criticism from others, noting that the broadcast was simply
"reporting important stories responsibly."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said some critics were under the mistaken impression that
CBS had aired the more graphic pictures. He said the video excerpts
were aired only after extensive debate and about a dozen rewritings
of the script. The producers concluded that they needed to show the
excerpts because it would be "more powerful than words alone," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's important for Americans to see it and to
understand the full impact and danger of the vicious propaganda being
spread against the United States and about Americans," Rather said in
the broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's family asked other news organizations not to follow CBS'
lead, saying, "Terrorists have made this video confident that the
American media would broadcast it and thereby serve their exact
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   NBC said it had no plans to do so beyond showing pictures from the
video, without sound, in a brief report about the controversy on
Wednesday's "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   NBC declined to comment on CBS' decision but noted, "The fact that
[the Pearl video] was being used as a propaganda tool is newsworthy."</TE>
<TE>   Other TV news organizations said they weren't planning to air
excerpts.</TE>

<HD>Witness in Skakel Case Recants '98 Statement</HD>
<DH>Trial: A family friend says she was mistaken when she
testified defendant's father made incriminating remarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A friend of the Skakel family testified Wednesday she was mistaken
when she told a grand jury that Michael Skakel made incriminating
statements to his father about the 1975 slaying of Martha Moxley.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 41, a Kennedy cousin, is charged with beating Moxley to
death with a golf club in their Greenwich neighborhood in 1975 when
both were 15.</LD>
<LD>   Family friend Mildred Ix took the stand Wednesday after Skakel's
78-year-old father, Rushton Skakel Sr., testified he could not
remember the conversation he had with Ix in 1981. Rushton Skakel, the
brother of Ethel Kennedy, suffers from dementia, his lawyer has said.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, Ix told a one-judge grand jury that Rushton Skakel said
his son was concerned he may have had too much to drink the night of
the slaying and could have forgotten killing Moxley.</TE>
<TE>   Ix said then that Michael Skakel told his father he wanted to be
given truth serum to help him.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Ix said the elder Skakel had told her that his son
wished to undergo a sodium pentothal test but never made the other
statements.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Rush never, ever heard from Michael that he ever killed
anyone," Ix said.</TE>
<TE>   "I then assumed something that was really in my heart of hearts.</TE>
<TE>   "I put in Rushton Skakel's mouth what I actually thought."</TE>
<TE>   Her testimony angered John Moxley, the victim's brother, who spoke
to reporters outside the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was boldfaced lies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, an apparently confused Rushton Skakel said he
could not remember the events surrounding Moxley's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 78 years old; my memory is not as good as it was back in
those years," he told prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Michael Sherman asked Rushton Skakel if he could
recall what happened in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very big incident, but I don't remember the details,"
Rushton Skakel said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors asked whether he remembered telling a neighbor in 1981
about incriminating comments made by his son. He said he did not.</TE>

<HD>Tennessee Lawmakers Avoid Tax Hikes; Protesters Cheer</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Anti-tax protesters celebrated a temporary victory Wednesday as the
state House adjourned without expanding the state sales tax or voting
on a proposal to add an income tax.</LD>
<LD>   "The voice of the people was heard," said 42-year-old Mark Cygler,
a self-employed chef who joined hundreds of other protesters outside
the Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   Cygler quickly added that the fight is far from over. The House
reconvenes Wednesday with the state facing a $480-million shortfall
in the current budget year. It would take $1.4 billion in new taxes
next year to fully fund Gov. Don Sundquist's $9.6-billion budget
proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Tennessee is one of nine states without a broad-based personal
income tax.</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh is attempting to pass a 4.5% income
tax, but doesn't expect a vote on the plan for another two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, demonstrators honked handheld air horns and
waved anti-tax signs as they anticipated a House vote on Naifeh's
bill.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs 'Whistle-Blower' Measure</HD>
<DH>Law: Bill makes federal agencies responsible for suits
brought against them instead of settlements being paid from a general
fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A bill signed Wednesday requires federal agencies to pay for
discrimination or "whistle-blower" cases from their own budgets.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation is called No Fear, an acronym for Notification and
Federal Anti-Discrimination and Retaliation Act.</LD>
<LD>   It "could not have been passed without the pain and the sheer
agony of so many employees who came forward to mention that their
lives were made almost in the form of a nightmare because they chose
to stand up," said Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas).</LD>
<TE>   President Bush signed the bill in an Oval Office ceremony attended
by civil rights activists and members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "By holding accountable those who insist upon discriminating
against others, the federal government will become a role model for
civil rights--and not civil rights violations," said House Judiciary
Chairman James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), a sponsor of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, federal agencies must pay for settlements or
judgments against them in whistle-blower and discrimination cases.
Currently, such payments are made from a general, government-wide
fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It means now the federal government will have to obey its own
laws ... not hide behind a slush fund in the Treasury to pay for
their indiscretions," said Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, a federal employee
who won a $600,000 judgment against the Environmental Protection
Agency for racial and gender bias. Her case was the impetus for the
law.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also requires that employees be notified of their
rights under antidiscrimination laws, and forces agencies to report
annually to Congress about how many discrimination cases were brought
against them, what happened in those cases and whether any employees
were disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, some EPA scientists said they were targeted for
reprisals after they questioned agency policies. An investigation
found that discrimination complaints against federal agencies filed
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission more than doubled
during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation should stop some of the managers whose actions
are like some international outlaw," said Leroy Warren, board member
of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Auditor Recalls Criminal Intent</HD>
<DH>Courts: During cross-examination, former Andersen partner
says he intended to obstruct justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A former Arthur Andersen partner testified Wednesday that he didn't
believe he was breaking the law at the time he ordered the
destruction of Enron Corp. audit documents last fall, but changed his
mind after a series of meetings with federal investigators and "a lot
of soul-searching."</LD>
<LD>   David Duncan, formerly the top Andersen executive auditing Enron's
books, said he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice last month
and agreed to testify against his former employer after concluding
that his motive for shredding files was to keep them away from
plaintiffs' lawyers and Securities and Exchange Commission
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan, 43, is considered the prosecution's key weapon as it seeks
to convict Andersen on obstruction of justice in federal court here
for its shredding of Enron documents. A conviction would probably
prompt the SEC to prohibit Andersen from auditing public companies
and cripple the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen attorneys had their first chance to question Duncan on
the stand, and spent much of the time seeking to show the accountant
lacked criminal intent and only pleaded guilty out of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination from Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin,
Duncan recounted being frozen out from the firm after Andersen
publicly reported the document destruction in January. Duncan said he
first met with federal investigators Jan. 14, a meeting initially
intended to discuss Enron accounting issues. The next day, he
testified, Andersen contacted his attorneys and notified them that it
planned to fire him. He said he had been unable to learn directly the
status of his job.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan met again with federal agents Jan. 16, and at the time, he
said, he did not believe he had violated the law by asking employees
to comply with the firm's document-retention policy. But in February,
Duncan said, he learned that the Justice Department had begun to
consider him a target.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he also learned that federal sentencing guidelines
could mean that he could face a far longer prison sentence if
convicted of other crimes, such as fraud. In late March, he said he
began telling members of his family that he believed he may have
committed obstruction. He said his realization came after "a lot of
soul-searching about what I believed to be all of my motivations" at
the time he initiated the destruction effort. He agreed to cooperate
in the U.S. Justice Department probe of Enron in exchange for a
potentially lighter sentence.</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal statute, to be convicted of obstruction,
a defendant must "corruptly persuade" others to destroy evidence to
make them unavailable for an official proceeding, such as a federal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said that in October, he believed that the law allowed him
to destroy records because his firm had not received a subpoena for
them. But months later, "I began to realize the law was certainly not
that clear cut," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin, however, contends that neither Duncan nor Andersen
violated the law because Duncan didn't intend to break the law and
because the SEC's informal inquiry against Enron did not constitute
an "official proceeding" directed at the Chicago-based accounting
firm.</TE>

<LD>   Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., the Pasadena-based publisher
of TV Guide magazine, reported a wider net loss for the first quarter
on costs related to a decline in asset values.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Gemstar fell as much as $1.14 to $8.60 after the results

<TE>   Gemstar posted a loss of $208million, or 50 cents a share,

average estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell 13% to $296.6 million, compared with the Multex
average estimate of $301.4 million.</TE>

<TE>   Gas Find off Vietnam</TE>
<TE>   Unocal Corp. said it and three partners may spend up to $1.5
billion over 25 years to develop natural gas discoveries off Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal, state-owned PetroVietnam, Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan and PTT
Exploration &amp; Production of Thailand have drilled 10 successful wells
in three fields with as much as 2.5trillion cubic feet of reserves
that are either proven or likely to exist, the Los Angeles-based
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Development of the fields is dependent on construction of a
235-mile pipeline in southern Vietnam and the construction of several
power plants, Unocal said. That, in turn, will depend on the
expansion of Vietnam's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam expects power usage to rise 15% a year.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal Vietnam President John Parmigiano said the company's gas
could also be exported to Thailand, Malaysia or Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal has a 42.4% stake in two blocks in its contracted
exploration area, and a 43.4% stake in a third block.</TE>

<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., the Pasadena-based publisher of

<LD>   Gemstar posted a loss of $208million, or 50 cents a share,

<TE>   Revenue fell 13% to $296.6 million, compared with the Multex
average estimate of $301.4 million.</TE>

<HD>Unocal Announces Gas Find off Vietnam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unocal Corp. said it and three partners may spend up to $1.5 billion
over 25 years to develop natural gas discoveries off Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal, state-owned PetroVietnam, Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan and PTT
Exploration &amp; Production of Thailand have drilled 10 successful wells
in three fields with as much as 2.5 trillion cubic feet of reserves
that are either proven or likely to exist, the Los Angeles-based
company said.</LD>
<LD>   Development of the fields is dependent on construction of a
235-mile pipeline in southern Vietnam and the construction of several
power plants, Unocal said. That, in turn, will depend on the
expansion of Vietnam's economy.</LD>
<TE>   Vietnam expects power usage to rise 15% a year.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal Vietnam President John Parmigiano said the company's gas
could also be exported to Thailand, Malaysia or Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal has a 42.4% stake in two blocks in its contracted
exploration area, and a 43.4% stake in a third block.</TE>

<HD>Region's 2002 Job Growth to Be Slow</HD>
<DH>Economy: A study shows the Inland Empire leading the
five-county area in employment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California will experience sluggish job growth for the rest
of this year, but the region's employment pulse should quicken in
2003, according to an economic forecast to be released today by Cal
State Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers project a recovery across most sectors in the
five-county Southern California region, composed of Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. The big
exception looks to be manufacturing, which isn't expected to see a
meaningful rebound until 2004, according to economist Lisa Grobar, an
associate director of the Office of Economic Research at Cal State
Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "There are too many negatives" weighing down the manufacturing
sector, said Grobar, who expects local factories to continue shedding
jobs through late next year.</LD>
<TE>   Among the factors hampering a quick manufacturing recovery are a
post-Sept. 11 collapse in commercial aircraft sales that has pounded
Southern California's aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   Weak foreign economies and a relatively strong dollar are making
it tough for the region's exporters to find markets for their goods.
Meanwhile, cheap imports continue to undercut local makers of
apparel, furniture and other consumer goods. Los Angeles County has
lost about 25,000 factory jobs over the last 12 months, and even the
Inland Empire, a growing manufacturing stronghold, has experienced
declines.</TE>
<TE>   Continued manufacturing job losses, coupled with weak job creation
in other sectors, will result in regional employment growth of 0.8%
this year--only about half of what it was in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, Grobar says, is that the recent economic slowdown
is nothing like the long, deep recession that struck Southern
California in the early 1990s. She predicts regional employment
growth will accelerate to 1.8% next year, led by gains in
construction, services, retail and wholesale trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire, the region's top job generator over the last
decade, will continue to lead the pack, thanks to plentiful open
space for new factories, offices, stores and housing. The Cal State
Long Beach forecast calls for job growth of 3.2% this year in
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, increasing to 3.7% in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "They have room to build ... at lower costs," Grobar said. The
Inland Empire "will continue to be the fastest growing area of our
region."</TE>
<TE>   Perennial laggard L.A. County faces more of a struggle. L.A.'s
aerospace industry and apparel-heavy manufacturing base have been hit
particularly hard. So has the county's travel and tourism industry,
which is more dependent on international visitors than other
California destinations. Cal State Long Beach forecasters predict
virtually no job growth in L.A. County this year, and a modest 1.2%
gain next year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is projected to see employment growth of 1.3% this
year, followed by 2.1% growth next year, according to the forecast,
while Ventura will see almost flat employment this year, followed by
1.3% job growth next year.</TE>

<HD>Advanced Cell Misspent U.S. Funds, Auditors State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advanced Cell Technology, a company trying to clone human embryos,
misspent $150,000 in federal grants and must return it, government
auditors said.</LD>
<LD>   The auditors, from the Boston office of the inspector general at
the Department of Health and Human Services, also raised questions
about Advanced Cell's financial condition.</LD>
<LD>   The audit was requested by Rep. Joseph R. Pitts (R-Pa.) to
determine whether federal funds were used to support human cloning
research. The auditors found no evidence of that.</LD>
<TE>   But they said the company charged the government $114,400 for
equipment not covered by the grants. Auditors also found that
Advanced Cell charged the government $35,000 for salaries that it
could not properly account for, auditors said.</TE>
<TE>   The audit recommended freezing the grants until Advanced Cell
improves its accounting policies and procedures and meets other
conditions--including providing evidence of its ability to continue
as a going concern.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health, a unit of Health and Human
Services, awarded Advanced Cell three grants totaling $2 million. The
grants cover animal cloning research, including efforts to clone a
cow and a mouse. The company has received $215,000 so far.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Cell, based in Worchester, Mass., did not respond to a
request for comment. But in an interview with Bloomberg News, Michael
West, the company's chief executive, called the audit a "witch hunt"
by opponents of human cloning. Advanced Cell wants to use cloned
embryos as a source of stem cells that could be used to treat
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts opposes cloning for any purpose, and the House has passed a
bill that would prohibit human cloning. The Senate will debate the
issue soon.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pitts said no federal funds should go to Advanced
Cell. The company has been awarded $1.8 million by the Advanced
Technology Program, in addition to the NIH funding.</TE>
<TE>   The Advanced Technology grant was frozen last winter pending an
inspection of Advanced Cell's financial management system, and the
company has not yet received any of the funds. The grant was for
biotechnology research involving adult cells and was first reported
in The Times in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Advanced Technology Program conducted its financial inspection
of Advanced Cell on May2 and found no problems with the company's
financial management systems, said Michael Baum, an Advanced
Technology spokesman. He said Advanced Technology, a unit of the
Commerce Department, plans to make the grant money available to
Advanced Cell.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Health and Human Services auditors, West admitted
the company could not "identify the exact hours worked." But he said
the company purchased the equipment only after receiving oral
permission from the NIH.</TE>
<TE>   West, in his letter, said the company planned to abandon research
under one grant totaling $267,000. The company has completed a second
grant totaling $99,729.</TE>
<TE>   He said auditors based their concerns about the company's
financial health on an outdated report prepared by Advanced Cell's
accountants for the two years ended December 2000.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Rank High Among Homeowners</HD>

<LD>Chinese immigrants have a higher rate of homeownership than whites
with similar incomes in three major markets, according to a study
that is scheduled to be released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The study suggests that more housing will be needed in gateway
cities where Chinese Americans tend to cluster. Moreover, the study
concludes that immigrant status doesn't necessarily lead to lower
rates of homeownership, a point that researchers have grappled over.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, Chinese immigrants ranked 23% higher than
whites, 20% higher in Los Angeles and 18% higher in New York, said
Gary Painter, who completed the study and heads the research
department at the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate.</LD>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether the pattern results from an extreme
desire for homeownership or whether Chinese Americans have access to
more resources than other minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   The results, part of a broader study on homeownership rates by
race, were based on 1990 Census data. More recent figures are being
released, but Painter said he expects the trend to remain the same.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Prices, Factory Production Rise in April</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. factories were busier in April and consumer prices posted their
sharpest rise in nearly a year, a sign the slack that hit the economy
after Sept. 11 was lifting as the recovery gains traction.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that industrial production rose
0.4% in April, a fourth straight monthly gain that reflected a pickup
in auto production.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices
increased a sharp 0.5% in April, the biggest gain since a matching
rise in May of last year.</LD>
<TE>   A hefty 10% rise in gasoline costs helped push the consumer price
index up, but even excluding volatile food and energy prices, the CPI
advanced 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's measure of the output of the nation's factories, mines
and utilities came largely in line with the expectations of Wall
Street economists, but the CPI was a bit higher than most had
forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said it did not signal an outbreak of inflation
and most investors stuck to bets the Fed would wait until August to
raise interest rates from 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   "If we see two more months like this of CPI exceeding
expectations, then people will worry. But the Fed will hold off,
because they want to see that the recovery is in place and solid,"
S&amp;P Marketscope analyst Paul Cherney said.</TE>
<TE>   With industrial output rising, the amount of production capacity
in use by firms also rose slightly, to 75.5% in April from a revised
75.3% in March.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed the continued, gradual recovery of the factory
sector as it shakes off the effects of a sharp decline in output that
started in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   April's gain was aided by a 3.1% advance in automobile production,
as car makers tried to keep pace with steady consumer demand.
Excluding autos, industrial production would have grown a smaller
0.2%, the Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   The factory sector saw output rise by 0.3%, its fourth straight
increase; mining production gained 1.1%; and utilities output was up
0.9%, a rise some economists pinned to warm weather.</TE>
<TE>   A third report showed businesses trimmed inventories for the 14th
consecutive month in March.</TE>

<HD>Electricity Price Cap Likely to Be Extended</HD>
<DH>Energy: Memos on Enron's market manipulation attempts lead
to change of heart by regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON, RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and NANCY RIVERA
BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal price limits credited for helping to bring California's
energy crisis under controls are likely to be renewed this fall, a
top regulator Wednesday told U.S. senators probing manipulation of
Western energy markets.</LD>
<LD>   "I fully expect we are not going to go from the regime we have to
nothing," said Patrick Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, facing tough questions at two Senate hearings
about market gaming in California. "We will put the appropriate
regime in place to make sure that just and reasonable rates continue
to happen."</LD>
<LD>   Wood had indicated a preference to let price limits to expire. But
that prospect evaporated in the heated political reaction to last
week's disclosure of Enron Corp. memos detailing ploys for gaming
California's energy market.</LD>
<TE>   California Gov. Gray Davis met with Wood last week to urge that
the price caps be extended, and there was "a big 'hallelujah!' from
the governor's office" Wednesday, said spokesman Steve Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   Wood's testimony came as Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) called for the
appointment of a special counsel to investigate Western energy
pricing and announced plans to grill Army Secretary Thomas White, a
former Enron executive, on what he knew about the company's efforts
to drive up prices during the California energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   White has denied any knowledge of Enron price manipulation, which
was revealed by memos last week. But the Bush administration's ties
to Enron have made the market manipulation investigation not only a
fight by California for refunds and lower-priced energy contracts but
a political battle between Democrats and the Republican
administration over whether federal regulators moved forcefully
enough to protect customers.</TE>
<TE>   The memos--the focus of Wednesday's hearings before the Senate's
consumer affairs subcommittee and Energy and Natural Resources
Committee--outlined ploys used to drive up prices during the energy
crisis in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Enron staff attorney Richard Sanders was one of five lawyers who
wrote or received the memos and who underwent sharp questioning
Wednesday from committee members. The attorneys insisted they acted
quickly to put an end to the deceptive practices. But senators
questioned whether they acted aggressively enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was in your position and I found out these schemes and these
scams that you discussed, I would be excited about putting a call
through to [former Enron Chairman Kenneth] Lay and saying, 'I've got
to tell you as your lawyer what I just learned,'" Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) told Sanders. "But you waited to December to put a stop to
it, and yet you can't ... prove that it ever stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic senators reserved their sharpest criticism for the
regulatory agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a full investigation of FERC and its behavior, its
contacts, is necessary to evaluate why the referee or regulator sat
silent," said Dorgan, chairman of the consumer affairs subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   FERC reluctantly enacted price limits last June, setting an upper
bound on prices for power and forbidding producers from withholding
supply. In a compromise with free-market advocates on the agency's
governing board, the control were to be temporary, expiring Sept. 30,
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Wood left open the possibility that FERC may make some changes in
the price limit plan when it takes up the issue this summer. He
hinted that Western states that have experienced no price spikes and
generate sufficient power to meet their needs may be exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Wood's comments were welcomed by the California Independent System
Operator, which balances supply and demand on an electricity grid
serving about 75% of the state. Cal-ISO also operates markets for
last-minute energy not already supplied by utilities' own generation
sources or long-term contracts with the state Department of Water
Resources, the primary power buyer for the state.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO has been pushing FERC to extend the price caps and other
market protections until the ISO can implement a broad market
redesign, which includes proposals for price controls.</TE>
<TE>   "The price cap has been very effective in keeping the market
healthy and keeping prices down," said Cal-ISO spokesman Gregg
Fishman.</TE>
<TE>   Although only 5% of the power for California's three big
investor-owned utilities is purchased through Cal-ISO's price-capped
markets, it still represents a significant number of megawatt-hours
each day, Fishman said. The current cap, sent through a complex
formula, is $92 a megawatt-hour and actual electricity prices
Wednesday topped out at little more than one-third of the cap.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Wood also offered some clues on how he will
approach demands by Davis and others to renegotiate long-term power
contracts entered into last spring. Wood said some of the abusive
practices may have already been forbidden by regulators before the
contracts were signed. In other cases, companies claim they
themselves put a halt to gaming strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "If the contract was signed thereafter, there probably is not a
direct link," Wood said. "If this behavior had stopped, that's a
pretty critical fact."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Davis urged FERC to expand its investigation to
include recently disclosed sham trades that Dynegy Inc. and Reliant
Resources Inc., both of Houston, conducted with CMS Energy of
Dearborn, Mich. The trades, which exchanged like amounts of energy at
the same price with CMS, did not affect the price or supply of
electricity in any markets and are no longer occurring, Dynegy and
Reliant said.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis, in a letter to Wood, said that FERC "needs to look at
these and other market manipulations."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Enron, power sellers singled out during Wednesday's
hearings were Williams Cos., Powerex Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy
and Coral Energy. All of the companies on Wednesday denied behaving
improperly in the California market.</TE>
<TE>   Williams of Tulsa, Okla., and Powerex, the marketing arm of
British Columbia's provincial utility, were mentioned in handwritten
notes from October 2000 meetings of Enron lawyers and traders, who
described those two companies as "pigs at trough." California Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, who released the notes late Tuesday along with the
attorneys general of Oregon and Washington, concluded that Enron's
description of Powerex and Williams meant others in the industry were
engaging in similar questionable trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins called Lockyer's assertion
"a pretty big leap," and she denied that the company manipulated
electricity supplies or prices through the sort of trading strategies
detailed in the Enron memos.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Sees 23 Firms at Risk of 'Triggers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 23 companies in the United States and Europe, including
energy trader Dynegy Inc. and entertainment giant Vivendi Universal,
run the risk of a liquidity crisis because of "triggers" in their
borrowing agreements, credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's said.</LD>
<LD>   Reporting on a survey of 1,000 companies, S&amp;P said about 500 have
borrowing agreements with triggers--clauses that could force a
company to post collateral or pay back debt if its credit rating is
downgraded.</LD>
<LD>   Faulted for not alerting investors soon enough to Enron Corp.'s
woes, S&amp;P and other rating firms have been poring over companies'
books in search of potentially lethal debt triggers.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P said none of the 23 firms--more than half of which are energy
companies--faces an imminent debt downgrade solely for having
triggers, because they are already factored into ratings. The company
list is available online at www .standardandpoors.com.</TE>

<HD>Southland Home Sales, Prices Keep Rising to Record Levels</HD>
<DH>Real estate: April marks the fifth straight month of new
highs. More increases are expected, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race to buy homes in Southern California intensified last month,
again raising prices and spurring sales to record levels across a
large swath of the region while paving the way for further increases
in months to come.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for a home rose 18% from a
year earlier to an all-time high of $254,000, according to figures
released Wednesday by DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a La Jolla
real estate research firm.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the fifth consecutive month that county prices set a
record, the longest streak since the last housing boom more than a
decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   Sales in Los Angeles County leaped more than 26% from the same
time last year to 11,268, making it the busiest April since 1989. The
percentage gain was slightly higher than analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   Across the board--from condominiums to estates--prices marched
upward in April. That is a change from previous months, when
entry-level homes were gaining fastest. The boost means that
transactions in Los Angeles and Orange County, which also reported
robust results last month, continue to close at a summer-like pace.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales numbers are not quite as high as they are in August,
but they are far stronger than what we're used to seeing in April,"
said John Karevoll, the DataQuick analyst who compiled the figures.</TE>
<TE>   Activity in both counties is being inflated by the same factors:
Low mortgage rates and a sluggish stock market are attracting buyers
when the supply of unsold homes is severely limited. The result is
upward pressure on prices.</TE>
<TE>   The supply of unsold Los Angeles County homes is about two months.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, it's barely over a month, according to the
California Assn. of Realtors. An inventory of nine to 10 months is
required for balance.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers' anxiety grows as the market churns faster, leading to
multiple offers for homes. As inventory shrinks, the purchase of a
lifetime for some buyers is being decided in hours, not days.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Chavez, 33, and her husband, James, offered to buy a house in
south Orange County within hours of it landing on the market.</TE>
<TE>   They handed their proposal to the sellers while another interested
buyer toured the home. The couple stretched to bid $736,000, or
$3,000 less than the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, who sought a quick sale because of a job transfer,
accepted the deal. Their proposal beat out higher offers that came
later.</TE>
<TE>   A slower reaction certainly would have left them empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't have gotten the house," Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   Double-digit price increases cannot be sustained indefinitely,
said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist of the California Assn.
of Realtors, but relief doesn't appear near.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is what happens when vigorous demand meets
limited supply," Appleton-Young said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that a preliminary report of price and sales trends her
group compiles shows a similar pattern to DataQuick's figures. "The
only thing stifling the market right now is the paucity of listings."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every analyst agrees that the market must eventually
cool. Many predict a slower rate of growth some time in the future,
if mortgage rates climb high enough to curb demand or affordability
levels drop low enough to price more people out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the key indicators that would indicate a slowdown have not
materialized, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of foreclosures in both counties remains near record
lows. The number of buyers using adjustable-rate mortgages to stretch
their purchasing power remains stable.</TE>
<TE>   The size of down payments, which would shrink if buyers were
struggling more, has barely budged. Lenders don't consider mortgage
payments out of line with incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have these trends continue into next year," Karevoll said
of robust price and sales gains.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, median prices, meaning half cost less and half
cost more, grew more than 16% to a record $337,000. Sales also
increased nearly 32% to 4,925. That is the best sales mark for any
April since figures from 1989, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   A combination of job growth, rising disposable incomes and low
mortgage rates is helping the Southern California market outpace the
rest of the state, said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman
University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised," said Adibi, who expected home prices to rise at a
single-digit pace this year. "People think prices will go higher, and
they are actively pursuing real estate. And given the tight supply,
that leads to such rapid price appreciation."</TE>

<HD>Southland Home Sales, Prices Keep Rising to Record Levels</HD>
<DH>Real estate: April marks the fifth straight month of new
highs. More increases are expected, analysts say.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The race to buy homes in Southern California intensified last month,
again raising prices and spurring sales to record levels across a
large swath of the region while paving the way for further increases
in months to come.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for a home rose 18% from a
year earlier to an all-time high of $254,000, according to figures
released Wednesday by DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a La Jolla
real estate research firm.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the fifth consecutive month that county prices set a
record, the longest streak since the last housing boom more than a
decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   Sales in Los Angeles County leaped more than 26% from the same
time last year to 11,268, making it the busiest April since 1989. The
percentage gain was slightly higher than analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   Across the board--from condominiums to estates--prices marched
upward in April. That is a change from previous months, when
entry-level homes were gaining fastest. The boost means that
transactions in Los Angeles and Orange County, which also reported
robust results last month, continue to close at a summer-like pace.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales numbers are not quite as high as they are in August,
but they are far stronger than what we're used to seeing in April,"
said John Karevoll, the DataQuick analyst who compiled the figures.</TE>
<TE>   Activity in both counties is being inflated by the same factors:
Low mortgage rates and a sluggish stock market are attracting buyers
when the supply of unsold homes is severely limited. The result is
upward pressure on prices.</TE>
<TE>   The supply of unsold Los Angeles County homes is about two months.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, it's barely over a month, according to the
California Assn. of Realtors. An inventory of nine to 10 months is
required for balance.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers' anxiety grows as the market churns faster, leading to
multiple offers for homes. As inventory shrinks, the purchase of a
lifetime for some buyers is being decided in hours, not days.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Chavez, 33, and husband James offered to buy a house in south
Orange County within hours of its landing on the market.</TE>
<TE>   They handed their proposal to the sellers while another interested
buyer toured the home. The couple stretched to bid $736,000, or
$3,000 less than the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, who sought a quick sale because of a job transfer,
accepted. Their proposal beat out higher offers that came later.</TE>
<TE>   A slower reaction would have left them empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't have gotten the house," Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   Double-digit price increases cannot be sustained indefinitely,
said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist of the California Assn.
of Realtors, but relief doesn't appear near.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is what happens when vigorous demand meets
limited supply," Appleton-Young said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that a report of price and sales trends her group
compiles shows a similar pattern to DataQuick's figures. "The only
thing stifling the market right now is the paucity of listings."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every analyst agrees that the market must eventually
cool. Many predict a slower rate of growth, if mortgage rates climb
enough to curb demand or affordability levels drop enough to price
more people out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the key indicators that would indicate a slowdown have not
materialized, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of foreclosures in both counties remains near record
lows. The number of buyers using adjustable-rate mortgages remains
stable.</TE>
<TE>   The size of down payments has barely budged. Lenders don't
consider mortgage payments out of line with incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have these trends continue into next year," Karevoll said
of robust price and sales gains.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, median prices, meaning half cost less and half
cost more, grew more than 16% to a record $337,000. Sales also
increased nearly 32% to 4,925. That is the best sales mark for any
April since figures from 1989, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   A combination of job growth, rising disposable incomes and low
mortgage rates is helping the Southern California market outpace the
rest of the state, said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman
University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised," said Adibi, who expected home prices to rise at a

that leads to such rapid price appreciation."</TE>

<HD>As Tech Goes, so Goes Key3Media</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trade show producer Key3-Media Group Inc., which puts on the huge
Comdex technology event in Las Vegas, said Wednesday that a
downtrodden tech industry is leading to reduced operating results
that will soon cause it to violate the terms of its bank loans.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles company's latest woes, including
much-weaker-than-expected results in the first quarter, turned the
stock into the biggest percentage loser on the New York Stock
Exchange on Wednesday, falling 31.6%, or $1.02, to $2.21. During
trading, it hit a 52-week low of $2.15 a share.</LD>
<LD>   The company's blunt-spoken chairman, Fredric D. Rosen, attributed
problems to the drop in corporate spending on information technology
and promotions, as well as the overall malaise in the tech industry.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen a more difficult environment, and I'm not having
fun," said Rosen, who built Ticketmaster into a powerhouse. "If the
industry is not going to be healthy, then we're not going to be
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen acknowledged that he is interested in acquiring House of
Blues, which is up for sale, and diversifying into concert
promotions, but experts say Key3's current problems make an
acquisition unlikely. Although he told analysts in a conference call
that he couldn't discuss the issue, he said in an interview, "If it
gets into a severe bidding war, we won't stay in it."</TE>
<TE>   Key3 reported a loss of $360 million, or $5.29 a share, for the
first quarter, most of it tied to a new accounting mandate to write
off goodwill from acquisitions. The company wrote off $344.6 million
of goodwill, the premium it already paid for the Comdex brand.
Excluding that, Key3 lost $5.9 million, compared with a $22.9-million
loss a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the write-off and a change in the timing of three
major trade shows mean the results cannot be compared with last
year's first quarter, when Key3Media lost $24 million, or 37 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   The company moved three major events normally held during the
second quarter to the first quarter, causing revenue in the cyclical
business to soar to $34.4 million from last year's first-quarter
revenue of $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   But even factoring in all the changes, the company still fell
short of Wall Street expectations, said Todd Morgan, a fixed-income
analyst at CIBC World Markets in New York. He was expecting a loss of
$3 million, excluding the accounting change, and sales of $37
million. Stock analysts, he said, were anticipating even better
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question, though, is if 2003 is going to be the year
that tech-related shows come back," Morgan said. "Comdex has been
eroding for several years," though it is still the biggest draw in
terms of attendance and near the top in the amount of square feet
sold to exhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan questioned Key3's strategy of continuing to put on big,
all-encompassing shows such as Comdex, Networld+Interop and Seybold
Seminars that charge exhibitors premiums for space. The sagging tech
industry is responding better to smaller shows that are more focused
on single areas, such as server-maintenance meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Comdex, which has become as much a media event as a place where
companies can check out and perhaps buy the latest business tech
gear, went from 2,337 exhibitors using 1.2 million square feet of
space two years ago to 1,685 exhibitors in 806,000 square feet last
fall, according to trade publication Trade Show Week.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen doesn't believe that the size of an event determines whether
it is a financial success.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, it's an industry event, and the events reflect the
industry," he said. "If the industry contracts, business contracts.
It doesn't matter how big the event is, you have to manage your costs
to the size of the event."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said the company probably would fall out of compliance with
its bank loans this quarter and next with provisions in loans
totaling $80 million, but he said executives were talking with the
consortium of banks to change or waive terms.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect that the company will resolve the issue favorably.
And Rosen noted, "You can be out of compliance in the second and
third quarters and be in compliance in the fourth quarter."</TE>

<HD>Nexell Will Wind Down Its Operations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nexell Therapeutics Inc. said its board authorized management to
begin winding down operations, after a lengthy but unsuccessful
effort to raise capital or form a business combination with another
company.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine-based biotechnology company said its work force will be
cut from 23 employees to three as a first step.</LD>
<LD>   Nexell is considering such alternatives as liquidation,
reorganization under the federal bankruptcy code or dissolution to
effect the wind-down.</LD>
<TE>   The company's shares went into a nose dive in Nasdaq trading,
falling 23 cents, or 66%, to 12 cents. The shares have traded below
$1 since late March.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell also reported a net loss of $500,000, or 3 cents a share,
for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $7.8 million,
or 39 cents, in the year-ago quarter, on a 37% drop in revenue to $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell said the latest results were significantly affected by
several one-time transactions and by the sale of its Toolbox business
to Baxter Healthcare Corp. in August. The Toolbox business was
Nexell's only revenue producer.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell's auditor had included a going-concern doubt in the
company's results in the previous quarter, citing recurring losses
from operations, negative cash flow from operations and the need for
additional funding.</TE>
<TE>   Nexell develops cell therapies and diagnostics for cancer and
autoimmune, metabolic and genetic diseases.</TE>

<HD>Northrop Forecasts 5 Years of Growth</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Kresa says firm is positioned to benefit from
defense budget increases. He is optimistic about TRW.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. Chairman Kent Kresa said Wednesday that the
company would post double-digit growth in annual earnings over the
next five years as the defense budget grows.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at Northrop's annual shareholder meeting in Santa Monica,
Kresa said he expects the company to post $6.60 to $7.10 a share in
operating earnings this year, up 13% to 21%, with a similar increase
in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   He predicted that defense procurement and spending on research and
development would increase 8% to 9% annually in the next five years.
"There will be close to double-digit growth for the industry over the
next five years, and we have structured the company to those
particular needs. We're in the sweet spot of what will be needed in
the future."</LD>
<TE>   Kresa also told shareholders that the company is optimistic about
reaching an acquisition agreement with TRW Inc. and expects to begin
conducting due diligence of TRW's operations next week as it
considers raising its bid for the Cleveland-based defense and auto
parts company. Century City-based Northrop, which made a hostile
$5.7-billion bid for TRW, is hoping to obtain a friendly deal.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholder meeting at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel in Santa
Monica was a far cry from the early 1990s, when Northrop appeared
destined to be a two-bit defense player as its B-2 stealth bomber
continually faced budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, Northrop is poised to become the nation's
second-largest defense contractor, with interests in virtually every
aspect of the military, including stealth bombers, aircraft carriers,
spy satellites and submarines, at a time when defense spending is
expected to see its biggest increases in nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a substantial change from what we've been living with in
the 1990s," said Kresa, who took the helm in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   To shareholders, it seemed all the more appropriate that the
company would unveil a flashy video showcasing Northrop's businesses
with the theme song from the movie "Flashdance."</TE>
<TE>   The song, "What a Feeling," seemed to be about the decade-long
travails of Northrop and its longest-tenured chief. It starts with a
slow, downbeat tone as the singer laments being alone and "full of
pride in a world made of steel," and then it builds a crescendo to "I
can have it all now I'm dancing for my life.... What a feeling!"</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," said Kresa, who was seeing the video for the first time.
"That's impressive, even for me." Kresa, 64, will reach the mandatory
retirement age in March.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop shares fell $1.74 to $121.84 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They are up 21% this year.</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Claims Waste by TV Exec</HD>
<DH>Courts: Entertainment mogul responds to suit by Eric
Tannenbaum, alleging mismanagement of now-defunct firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the continuing saga of Michael Ovitz's crumbling entertainment
company, the onetime Hollywood kingmaker alleges in court papers that
Eric Tannenbaum, the former head of his now-defunct television
company, wasted millions of dollars and seriously mismanaged the
venture.</LD>
<LD>   A declaration filed Wednesday by Ovitz in Los Angeles Superior
Court states that throughout the 21/2 years Artists Television Group
was in operation, "I learned of many facts that gave me grave
concerns regarding Mr. Tannenbaum's ability to manage the financial
aspects of a substantial television production company."</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz noted $1 million spent on largely unused office space in
Westwood as well as several instances in which Tannenbaum paid
executives exorbitant salaries. One executive responsible for helping
create television shows--a position Ovitz said typically earned
$125,000 to $150,000--was paid $425,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that every expenditure of any significance
was approved by Michael Ovitz," said Tannenbaum attorney Andrew
White.</TE>
<TE>   The declaration is in response to a lawsuit Tannenbaum filed
against Ovitz in April claiming fraud, deceit, defamation and breach
of contract.</TE>
<TE>   Tannenbaum is seeking $9.5 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz wants to get the fraud and defamation claims thrown out and
to recast Tannenbaum's suit as a contract dispute, according to
sources close to Ovitz.</TE>
<TE>   ATG, along with Ovitz's other entertainment ventures, including
Artists Management Group, was launched in the spring of 1999. He
shuttered ATG in the fall of 2001 and sold his stake in AMG two weeks
ago. Ovitz reportedly lost close to $100 million of his own funds in
the venture.</TE>

<HD>Drug Makers' Stocks Fall on News of FDA Investigations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration delivered major blows to two
health-care companies Wednesday, sending the shares of
Schering-Plough Corp. and Abbott Laboratories Inc. sharply lower.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey-based drug maker Schering-Plough said it was informed
that the U.S. government has launched a criminal probe of one or more
of the firm's products.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, suburban Chicago-based Abbott Labs said the FDA found
one of Abbott's plants failed to comply with quality standards.</LD>
<TE>   Schering-Plough, whose plant problems in Puerto Rico and New
Jersey have weighed heavily on its revenue and earnings, said in a
regulatory filing that the FDA's office of criminal investigation in
Puerto Rico was leading the probe.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation is at a very preliminary stage, and that is
all we can say at this point," said spokesman William O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough makes products including allergy medicine Clarinex
and hepatitis C treatment ribavirin at plants in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA regularly oversees drug firms' testing, labeling and
manufacturing efforts and works with them to fix deficiencies.
Analysts said the criminal nature of the probe indicates that the FDA
suspects Schering-Plough deliberately strayed from FDA policy.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough's shares fell 12.3%, or $3.49, to $25, the biggest
percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   FDA spokesman Brad Stone, when asked about the Schering-Plough
investigation, said it is not the agency's policy to comment on such
matters. Schering-Plough disclosed in February 2001 that the FDA had
pinpointed quality control problems at its plants in Puerto Rico and
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   For Abbott, which makes prostate treatment Flomax, HIV and AIDS
drugs Kaletra and Norvir, and various diagnostic tests and
nutritional products, the FDA decision is the latest setback for the
company in a nearly decade-long dispute with the government over
quality standards.</TE>
<TE>   The plant in question is Abbott's Lake County, Ill., diagnostic
manufacturing operations, where the company makes blood tests used by
laboratories and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Abbott dropped $4.84, or 9.4%, to $46.90 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Agencies Miss Small-Business Goals</HD>
<DH>Government: Report on programs to boost federal spending
says target last fiscal year was missed by $10 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal agencies encouraged by Congress to meet specific spending
goals with small, women-owned or disadvantaged businesses missed
those targets last fiscal year by more than $10 billion, a report
released Wednesday showed.</LD>
<LD>   The third annual scorecard, issued by Democrats on the House Small
Business Committee, showed that among 21 agencies, accounting for
roughly 96% of all federal spending, only two--the Interior and
Agriculture departments--met at least 80% of their spending goals.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, the Defense Department, which accounts for 65% of all
federal contracts, failed to meet any of its procurement goals with
small, women-owned or disadvantaged businesses or firms in low-income
areas, the report showed.</LD>
<TE>   Disadvantaged businesses are those run by economically and
socially disadvantaged entrepreneurs as determined by their net
worth, education and history of their business.</TE>
<TE>   Had the government met its spending targets, $76.9 billion would
have gone to small, women-owned or disadvantaged businesses or those
in low-income areas. The actual spending amount was $66.5 billion,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   With many small businesses dependent on government contracts for a
large portion of their income, the failure to reach out to small
firms has some congressional leaders worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concerns are based on the fundamental question of fairness,"
said Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez (D-N.Y.), ranking Democrat on the House
committee. "Unless there is an immediate and radical shift in the way
agencies structure their contracts and work with small businesses,
next year's scorecard will surely be worse than today's."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, which spent $219.6 billion in fiscal 2001,
has at least four programs designed to funnel more contracting
dollars to small, women-owned or disadvantaged businesses or to those
located in low-income, high-unemployment communities.</TE>
<TE>   Each has separate goals established by law, but there are no
statutory penalties for noncompliance. The scorecard is designed to
add some accountability, a spokeswoman for Velazquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the programs reviewed, the one targeted toward women fared the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed that federal agencies met less than half the
goal of spending 5% with women-owned firms, costing those companies
more than $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the largest of the programs, aimed at small business
in general, fell just short of its target. Government agencies spent
22.81% of their dollars with small businesses. The goal was 23%.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, missing targets in each of the programs
cost firms across the nation $10.4 billion in lost business.</TE>

<HD>IRS to Audit, Challenge Disney's Tax Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service is auditing Walt Disney Co.'s income tax
returns for 1993 through 1995 and plans to dispute some of the
company's tax filings, Disney disclosed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "While the audit is not complete, the IRS has recently indicated
its intention to challenge certain of the company's tax positions,"
Disney reported in a quarterly filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Disney said the dispute could force it to make undisclosed
additional payments to the IRS. The company said, however, that it
meets tax laws and will vigorously defend itself against any
challenge.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that the company has adequately provided for any
foreseeable payments related to these matters and consequently do not
anticipate any material earnings impact," Disney said in its filing.
Company representatives declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank-based entertainment conglomerate did not give details
on the audit, which is expected to be completed by September. The
audit encompasses the period when Disney undertook a highly complex
restructuring of its investment in the Euro Disney theme park outside
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   While it's not uncommon for large companies to be audited by the
IRS, it's unusual for tax disputes to escalate to the point where
companies feel obligated to disclose them in corporate filings.</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokesman Don Roberts said the agency does not comment on such
cases.</TE>
<TE>   He said the IRS reviews the books of all companies with assets of
$250 million or more, but only audits about one-third of them.
Disney's disclosure comes in a post-Enron climate in which major
corporations are under heightened pressure from shareholders to
divulge any and all bookkeeping items that could surprise investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It has much more to do with what we think is proper disclosure,"
said a company source. "It's not a financial issue."</TE>
<TE>   The source added that Disney and other media companies routinely
face such audits.</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts were unaware of the issue until it was reported
Wednesday in the company's quarterly report.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure, however, brought little reaction from Wall Street.
Disney's shares rose 10 cents to close at $24.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<CX>   IRS audits--A story in Thursday's business section incorrectly stated
that the IRS reviews the books of all companies with assets of $250
million or more, but only audits about one-third of them. The story
should have stated that the IRS reviews the income tax returns of all
companies with assets of $10 million or more to determine whether
they require auditing. The IRS last year audited about one-third of
the companies with assets of $250 million or more.</CX>

<HD>Survey of Spanish-TV Viewers May Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO and ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In meetings with ad buyers here this week, executives from Univision
Communications Inc. and Telemundo Communications Group, the country's
largest Spanish-language broadcasters, said that Nielsen Media
Research is close to unveiling a new system of counting
Spanish-speaking homes. The move potentially would give these
broadcasters higher ratings and allow them to charge more for ads.</LD>
<LD>   Before the new system becomes official, Nielsen needs approval
from the Media Ratings Council, a government accreditation group that
weighs in on TV and radio research, according to Nielsen spokeswoman
Karen Kratz. If the change is approved, it will bring to an end a
long wait for Spanish-language television network executives, who for
years have maintained that the current system relied on outdated
models of gathering data.</LD>
<LD>   Univision's co-president of network sales, Dennis McCauley, told
advertisers at a Lincoln Center presentation Wednesday that the
Nielsen changes will "alter the way media is bought and sold."</LD>
<TE>   (Even with the supposed undercount, the massive Univision is the
fifth-largest broadcast network in the country, after ABC, NBC, CBS
and Fox. It reaches 85% of the Spanish-speaking viewing audience in
the country, as measured by Nielsen.)</TE>
<TE>   But Kratz said it is premature to assume that Univision's ratings
will soar as a result.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a big change, but I don't know if we're going to
see a big difference in numbers. [Univision and Telemundo] are going
to look for any ways they can to get those advertising dollars on
their network," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be determined is how Nielsen will identify a
Spanish-language television viewer: according to the language spoken
only by adults in the household or according to the language spoken
by both adults and children in the household.</TE>
<TE>   This fall Nielsen will start issuing new reports along with those
generated under the current system so that broadcast network clients
can make comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "After a full year of looking at those differences, we'll
implement it," Kratz said.</TE>
<TE>   Univision and Telemundo now complain they must purchase two
services from Nielsen: one that enables advertisers to see their
ratings among other Spanish-language networks and one that enables
them to compare the ratings with those of all the networks, in any
language.</TE>
<TE>   The new system will streamline that data.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of advertisers want to see an apples-to-apples measurement,
so you end up subscribing to both," said Alan Sokol, chief operating
officer for Telemundo, which was purchased by NBC this year.</TE>

<HD>Union to Vote on Strike in Vegas</HD>
<DH>Labor: Housekeepers at hotels cite intolerable workloads. A
walkout could cripple city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying their workloads have climbed to intolerable levels, Las Vegas
hotel housekeepers, supported by thousands of hotel and casino
co-workers, are likely to vote today to authorize a citywide strike.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides acknowledge tensions are high in negotiations between
gambling moguls and national union leaders, and today's union vote at
a university arena is expected to be packed and emotional. The
current five-year contracts with various hotel groups expire May 31.</LD>
<LD>   A strike by the 48,000-member Culinary Workers Union, which also
represents kitchen help, coin changers, porters and other service
workers, could cripple the resort city just as it recovers from a
severe post-Sept. 11 tourism slump.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of pressure on everybody right now," said Alan
Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage Inc., the biggest operator on the
Strip. "If a strike vote is affirmative, it's going to raise the
stakes very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The Culinary Workers, affiliated with the national Hotel Employees
and Restaurant Employees union, has been a model of organizing and
partnering with management in recent years. As the city reinvented
itself over the last decade, the union also grew; it now represents
about 90% of workers on the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   But labor-management relations quickly deteriorated after the
terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, when
tourism plummeted and resorts quickly laid off workers. For example,
MGM Mirage, which owns major resorts on the Strip including the
Bellagio and Treasure Island, sent home 6,000 of its 41,300 workers
the week after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Feldman said the company had no choice. "Our business dropped
50% almost overnight," he said. "This notion that the layoffs were
too fast and too deep is ignorant of the reality."</TE>
<TE>   The union, however, says that employers have been pushing workers,
particularly housekeepers, to speed up the pace for several years,
and that they took advantage of the crisis to accelerate that trend.
Union officials also said hotels have been slow to rehire as business
rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about getting more work with less workers," said D.
Taylor, the union's top officer in Las Vegas. "There's no question
about it. All of our workers are feeling the strain now."</TE>
<TE>   The September layoffs and shift reductions created another crisis
central to these negotiations: They drained the union's health
insurance plan, which is funded by employer contributions based on
wages. Benefits are maintained for four months after a layoff.</TE>
<TE>   To balance the fund, some employers want workers to contribute to
their insurance plans. But free family health insurance has been a
union hallmark in Las Vegas, defended in two previous strikes, in
1984 and 1990. "We've sacrificed wage gains some years to keep that
benefit, and we're not about to give it up now," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor has said the union is not asking for wage increases in
light of increased health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   If workers authorize the strike as expected, union officials said
they will take their message directly to tourists on the Strip. On
Friday, they plan to set up television sets on sidewalks where
passersby can view a union-produced video decrying high housekeeping
workloads. In the short segment, workers complain of cleaning as many
as 14 suites a day, many of them filthy with remnants of all-night
parties and large numbers of guests.</TE>
<TE>   That's just the sort of tactic employers are dreading. "We've had
18 years of uninterrupted labor cooperation," said Feldman of MGM
Mirage. "In that time, we've seen a period of unprecedented growth
that has benefited both labor and management. We need to keep that in
mind as our objective. Both of us have too much at risk not to."</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart to Bring Supercenters to State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN and MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Wednesday that it will open 40 supercenters
across California over the next four to six years, bringing these
giant discount-plus-grocery stores to the state for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The move is a direct challenge to grocery chains in California, as
Wal-Mart Supercenters in other states have eroded the profits of
small and large rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Bentonville, Ark.-based seller said it has yet to
determine locations for the new stores, analysts said half are likely
to be conversions of current Wal-Mart discount stores, with new
construction making up the rest.</LD>
<TE>   The move to take on the grocery business in California was
inevitable for Wal-Mart, which most analysts say will eventually try
to convert as many as possible of its discount stores to the bigger
concept.</TE>
<TE>   The mass merchant already has supercenters in 45 states, with the
bigger stores making up about half of its 3,000 U.S. stores.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last frontier for Wal-Mart, and it just happens to be
the largest state," said Shelly Hale, a retail analyst with Banc of
America in San Francisco. "It won't be without its challenges, but 40
is a very low number. This is just the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   And with as much as 225,000-square-feet--the size of five football
fields--and 500 employees per store, communities across the state
will find themselves reexamining the issues of the so-called big box
stores, balancing needed jobs and consumer demand against the
potential that Wal-Mart will crowd out small shops and other
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The supercenters typically move into a new market by offering a
full array of food, from deli to bakery to produce and packaged
goods, at prices about 15% to 20% lower than many area markets, Hale
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the near term, however, the 40 stores--which are likely to
generate about $3 billion in annual revenue--will account for just 2%
of California grocery sales.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway Inc., which declined to comment on the expansion of
Wal-Mart Supercenters, recently launched a counter-offensive against
its discount competition, test marketing a greater inventory of
general merchandise, such as household appliances, sheets and towels,
at some of its Northern California stores.</TE>
<TE>   Although the supercenters tend to leech sales from established
players in the first months of operation, sales usually return to
normal for most of the top supermarket operators after about a year,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Wal-Mart tends to target low- to middle-income
grocery shoppers, leaving the upper end and gourmet consumers to
other stores.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the black death," said Mark Husson, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch in New York. "Everbody gets sick, but not everybody
dies."</TE>
<TE>   Supermarkets in urban areas such as Los Angeles are likely to be
even less affected because of Wal-Mart's inability to find
appropriate sites for its huge stores, Husson says. About 70% of
Wal-Mart's supercenters are outside the top 100 major markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Wal-mart officials say they are learning to adapt to smaller
sites, opening stores such as its new location in Dallas, which has a
parking structure underground, rather than the traditional Wal-Mart
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "The retail environment is very competitive, but we like that,"
says Wal-Mart spokesman Bob Mc- Adam. "Our best stores have solid
competition all around them."</TE>

<HD>Next Wave of Beverages</HD>
<DH>Companies roll out water lines with fruit flavors, vitamins
and herbs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's largest beverage makers are about to launch an all-out
campaign to change your definition of water.</LD>
<LD>   In coming months, PepsiCo Inc., Snapple Beverage Group Inc. and
other companies will roll out a barrage of lightly sweetened "waters"
laced with fruit flavors, vitamins, herbs and even ingredients used
to treat specific medical conditions.</LD>
<LD>   With soda sales slipping and energy drinks losing their buzz among
consumers, beverage makers are hoping these enhanced waters can build
on the success of bottled water, providing consumers something new
that won't make them feel guilty.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just giving [consumers] more reasons to drink water," said
Chad Dick, senior marketing manager for PepsiCo's Aquafina brand,
which is launching a line of fruit-flavored, vitamin-enhanced waters
called Aquafina Essentials.</TE>
<TE>   With prices up to 30% higher than that of most bottled waters or
sodas, enhanced waters also are giving a healthy boost to beverage
makers' bottom lines.</TE>
<TE>   Most enhanced waters, with 10 to 40 calories per 8-ounce serving,
are still lower in calories than juice or soda, but some have as many
as 80 calories per serving, bringing the total calorie count to 160
for the average 16-ounce container. By contrast, non-diet colas have
about 215 calories per 16-ounce serving and orange juice has about
225 calories.</TE>
<TE>   The higher-calorie waters are "starting to be more like a juice
drink," said Valerie Skala, a vice president of analytic product
management with food research firm Information Resources Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Bottled water has done so well because people are buying into the
purity, said Gary Hemphill, vice president of Beverage Marketing
Corp., a New York research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start adding some things in, the purity equation gets
muddled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With caffeinated and oxygenated waters having drifted off into
retail oblivion, Hemphill is not sure whether consumers will latch on
to enhanced waters.</TE>
<TE>   But many believe the more mainstream enhanced waters have a good
shot at getting Americans to drink more water, offering healthy
additives such as vitamins, herbs, electrolytes, calcium and soluble
fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Based on preliminary sales figures, Skala of Information Resources
projects sales of nearly $200 million by year's end--still small
compared with last year's $14.7 billion in carbonated beverage sales,
but a big start for a new category.</TE>
<TE>   "I think flavored [still] water is going to become a section
almost unto itself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first such products out on supermarket shelves in the last
year were Energy Brand's VitaminWater, Veryfine's Fruit20 and Propel
by PepsiCo's Gatorade brand that is a so-called fitness water with
vitamins B and C in flavors such as black cherry and orange.</TE>
<TE>   In coming months, much of the rest of the beverage industry will
be jumping in, including Snapple with its Elements fruit-flavored
waters and health products maker Baxter International Inc. with
Pulse, a fruity water supplement designed to ward off prostate
trouble in men and ease menopause in women.</TE>
<TE>   But the entry of soda giants Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo will move
these waters into the mainstream, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo launches Aquafina Essentials next month. Coca-Cola will
introduce Dasani NutriWater early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other enhanced waters, these drinks have fruit flavors
designed to mask the chalky taste of the vitamin solutions and other
ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   However, they're still clear like water, a factor that Dick of
PepsiCo said was important for Aquafina in convincing people the
drink was healthy and pure as water despite its sweet taste.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are a clear product, that more closely links you with
water's heritage," Dick said.</TE>
<TE>   Bottled water has been a boost to soda giants such as PepsiCo in
the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Though sales of carbonated beverages such as soda have dropped
about 4% in the last five years, sales of bottled water have more
than tripled, as people have become more health-conscious and leery
of the quality of tap water.</TE>
<TE>   Aquafina rang up $214 million in sales last year, and Dasani
brought in $168 million, according to Information Resources.</TE>
<TE>   And although energy drinks such as Red Bull had seemed poised to
capture a greater share of the beverage market, sales growth has
slowed over the last year, Skala said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think those products are fad products that are
definitely on a downward trend," Skala said.</TE>
<TE>   Water, analysts said, is here to stay.</TE>
<TE>   And as more people live lives on the go, they'll need to carry
bottles of it with them.</TE>
<TE>   Flavored waters are just a way to keep people from getting bored
with water, said Marie Devlin, brand manager of Gatorade's Propel.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is just to have another alternative that [consumers]
still see as healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Propel is focused on fitness-conscious customers, while Snapple
appears to be targeting its Elements at the energy drink set with
vibrant colors and exotic ingredients such as ginseng, guarana, bee
pollen and gingko biloba as well as more traditional health enhancers
such as beta carotene.</TE>
<TE>   Trading down to plain water for these consumers would be too
difficult, said Michael Sands, Snapple's chief marketing and
operations officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers want nirvana; they want something to be sweet and have
no calories, yet be natural like water," Sands said.</TE>
<TE>   Snapple tried to bottle that equation with a product flavored with
fruit essence, called Snap20, that it test-marketed in Santa Barbara
last year.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers said it wasn't sweet enough. So its new version,
Elements, contains fructose, vivid colors and 100 calories.</TE>
<TE>   That, to Hemphill, raises the question, "When is water no longer
water?"</TE>
<TE>   And will these products keep consumers from drinking plain old
water?</TE>
<TE>   "This just draws more attention and traffic to the bottled water
aisle," said International Bottled Water Assn. spokesman Stephen Kay.
"That's a good thing."</TE>

<HD>Enron Creditors to Query Andersen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge Wednesday gave Enron Corp. creditors
permission to investigate Arthur Andersen's plans to sell assets,
restructure or liquidate.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez gave the 14-member official committee of
Enron's unsecured creditors the authority to subpoena documents about
Andersen's restructuring efforts.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is determining whether to sue Andersen to try to
preserve the accounting firm's dwindling assets, according to the
panel's lead attorney, Luc Despins of New York firm Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley &amp; McCloy. Enron creditors, employees and stockholders view
Andersen's assets as a source of funds to help pay damages that may
be awarded in lawsuits arising from the Enron collapse.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen, Enron's former corporate auditor, is under fire for
approving the questionable accounting treatment of a number of
controversial transactions that led to Enron's collapse last fall.
Hurt by its association with Enron, Andersen is bleeding clients and
making deals to sell its tax, audit and consulting operations.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in the Enron bankruptcy also learned Wednesday that a
court-appointed special examiner, who will investigate Enron's
collapse, may be nominated as soon as Friday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trustee Carolyn S. Schwartz, in charge of screening
candidates, told Gonzalez that she has selected a candidate after a
nationwide search but needs to complete her review of potential
conflicts of interest before submitting the person's name to
Gonzalez, perhaps by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez also said he would rule today on a motion to disqualify
law firm Milbank Tweed from serving as chief attorney for the
official committee of unsecured creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors not serving on the committee challenged Milbank Tweed,
saying the firm's role in certain controversial Enron transactions
presents a conflict of interest that can't be resolved. Milbank Tweed
pointed out that the creditors committee, composed of 14 banks,
energy firms and other large and sophisticated corporations, many
with their own independent legal representation, voted unanimously to
retain the law firm.</TE>

<HD>Tech Pulls Off Third Straight Rise</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The Dow and S&amp;P 500 fall as investors cash in.
Nasdaq posts gains, giving it a boost of 7% for the week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's rally took a breather Wednesday as investors cashed in
some of their profits from two days of big gains. But the technology
sector managed its third straight advance, an achievement not seen
since early April.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the market was tentative after mixed economic
news--a rise in consumer prices and an increase in industrial
production.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are wary of sending stocks much higher, particularly
after the Dow Jones industrials surged 358 points Monday and Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence mounts that we are on the recovery side of things,
and the economists are bullish. But we aren't going to have a big
rally until we get some confirmation of earnings and revenue growth,"
said Philip Dow, managing director of equity strategy at Dain
Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow fell 54.46 points, or 0.5%, to 10,243.68. The
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was off 6.21 points, or 0.6%, to
1,091.07 after gaining 4% on Monday and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.51 points, or 0.4%, to
1,725.56, giving the tech-laden index a gain of 7% this week.</TE>
<TE>   Winners were slightly ahead of losers on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe the market's recent sell-off climaxed last
week when the major indexes closed at levels not seen since early
October.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, they expect the indexes to trade within a narrow
range.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we are quite through with the down days, but I
think we are at the end of the decline," said Al Mirman, strategist
at V Finance in Sarasota, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers swept into the market earlier this week amid a leap in
April retail sales, solid earnings from No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart
Stores and an upbeat report from closely watched Applied Materials,
which produces equipment used to make semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart fell 62 cents to $56.77 on Wednesday. But Applied
Materials extended its two-day rally, rising 11 cents to $26.75 after
blowing past forecasts for new orders in its earnings statement
released after the closing bell Tuesday, suggesting a recovery in the
chip industry.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech stocks also rose. Cisco Systems gained 11 cents to
$16.56; Oracle climbed 38 cents to $9.19; and Intel gained 9 cents to
$30.24. Dell Computer rose 80 cents to $27.70 ahead of its earnings
due out today.</TE>
<TE>   But Hewlett-Packard fell $1.15 to $19.35. The company Tuesday
reported earnings that met expectations, but didn't make projections
about future business.</TE>
<TE>   Drug makers weighed on the blue-chip indexes. Abbott Laboratories
fell $4.84 to $46.90 and Schering-Plough slid $3.49 to $25, after
hitting a five-year low earlier in the session. The Amex
pharmaceutical index was off 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott said U.S. regulators found one of its plants failed to
comply with quality standards. And Schering-Plough, beset with its
own manufacturing problems, said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has launched a criminal probe of one or more of the
firm's products.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar pulled back, and Treasury bond yields dipped despite a
report showing a pickup in industrial production in April and another
that consumer prices rose in April by the largest amount in almost a
year.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Near-term crude oil futures fell $1.21 to $28.15 a barrel in New
York trading after hitting an eight-month high Tuesday. That pulled
energy stocks lower. Exxon Mobil lost 87 cents to $39.71, while
driller Noble fell $2 to $40.89 and Baker Hughes lost $1.52 to
$35.96.</TE>
<TE>   * Business software maker Computer Associates fell $1.35 to $17.75
as the Securities and Exchange Commission broadened its probe into
the company.</TE>
<TE>   * Network Appliance, a maker of data storage products, fell $2.99
to $15.05. The company posted a quarterly profit but investors
questioned its revenue outlook.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Restates Results, Posts Wider 2001 Loss</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. said Wednesday that its loss ballooned to $2.42 billion
in 2001 after it restated results for the first three quarters,
following an accounting investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Federated Department Stores Inc. said first-quarter
operating earnings were flat as sales dipped. Nordstrom Inc. and
AnnTaylor Stores Corp. posted profit gains in the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, Troy, Mich.-based Kmart had not reported results for
full-year 2001, so the financial figures shed additional light on
what went so wrong at the retailer, now in bankruptcy proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   "These results reconfirm the significant difficulties Kmart
experienced last year, including unsuccessful sales and marketing
initiatives, an erosion in supplier confidence, and below-plan sales
and earnings performance in the fourth quarter," Chief Executive
James Adamson said.</TE>
<TE>   In the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Kmart said its loss widened to
$2.42 billion, or $4.89 a share, from a loss of $244 million, or 48
cents, the previous year. Excluding various one-time items, Kmart's
loss was $987 million, or $2 a share, in fiscal 2001. It earned $219
million, or 47 cents, the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in 2001 fell 2.4% to $36.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said its probe of how the company was run under former CEO
Chuck Conaway is continuing and includes the U.S. attorney's office
in eastern Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares ended off 5 cents at $1.17 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Among other retailers:</TE>
<TE>   * Federated, parent of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and other chains,
said net income for the quarter ended May 4 was $89 million, or 43
cents a share. Profit in the year-earlier quarter was $58 million, or
29 cents a share, but excluding one-time charges in that period
per-share results were 42 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in the latest quarter fell 2.9% to $3.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Profit per share was 1 cent higher than the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Analysts said the
firm has benefited from lean inventories.</TE>
<TE>   Federated shares rose 19 cents to $43.17 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Nordstrom said it had a profit, excluding one-time costs, of
$30.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the period ended April 30,
compared with $24.8 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose
2.3% to $1.25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * AnnTaylor said profit in the quarter ended May 4 jumped to $20.9
million, or 67 cents a share, from $13.7 million, or 46 cents, a year
ago, using similar accounting. Sales rose 12.5% to $345 million.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers who took on the tobacco industry are teaming up to file
lawsuits alleging that drug makers inflated prices, according to an
analyst's report.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmaceutical companies including Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Abbott
Laboratories and Schering-Plough Corp. are under attack from state
governments and consumer groups that claim government heath-insurance
programs pay too much for drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Dick Scruggs, who filed the first state lawsuit against
tobacco companies, formed a consortium to file against drug makers,
said a report by Barbara Dreyfuss and Tim Anderson, Prudential
Securities analysts. Almost every big drug maker can expect subpoenas
by mid-2002, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   The Scruggs consortium plans to file on behalf of states. Scruggs'
Pascagoula, Miss., law firm said he wasn't available for comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UST Inc. must pay $1.05 billion to Conwood Co. for monopolizing part
of the smokeless tobacco market, a U.S. appeals court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Conwood, maker of Kodiak brand snuff tobacco, sued UST in 1998.
Greenwich, Conn.-based UST makes the Copenhagen and Skoal brands of
snuff, a ground-up moist tobacco that users place between the lip and
gum.</LD>
<LD>   Closely held Conwood told jurors that UST, which controls about
77% of the snuff market, thwarted competition through exclusive
arrangements with retailers and vandalized or removed Conwood store
displays.</LD>
<TE>   The three-judge panel of the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati upheld a trial judge's decision to triple a $350-million
jury award against UST in February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   UST fell $2.66 to $37.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>The World Trade Organization struck down U.S. steel import duties
imposed in 1993, handing the European Union a victory in its battle
against U.S. protection for its steel industry.</LD>
<LD>   The WTO outlawed duties as high as 37% imposed on steelmakers
including Anglo-Dutch firm Corus Group.</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary ruling adds to tensions over steel tariffs imposed
by President Bush this year. Spokesmen for the EU, U.S. and WTO had
no comment on the still-confidential ruling, which will become final
next month. The U.S. can appeal.</LD>

<HD>Judge Questions Microsoft Penalties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The judge in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case questioned whether
penalties proposed by nine states go beyond the wrongdoing found last
year by a federal appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   The states are demanding a "modular" version of Microsoft's
Windows personal computer operating system that would let computer
makers remove the code for the Internet Explorer Web browser and
other programs. The states, led by California and Iowa, want remedies
that go beyond a proposed settlement reached by Microsoft and the
Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told state lawyer
Steven P. Kuney the appeals court decision appeared much more
concerned with simply letting computer makers hide those programs
from computer users.</LD>
<TE>   "The focus doesn't seem to be on code removal," the judge said.
"What relief will removal of end-user access not provide you?"</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly must decide whether to approve the proposed
settlement of the 4-year-old case or adopt the stricter remedies
urged by the dissenting states.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft fell 13 cents to $54.75 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMS Energy Corp. said it engaged in bogus electricity trades that
inflated revenue and expenses by $4.4 billion over 18 months in an
attempt to become a leading energy trader.</LD>
<LD>   Dearborn, Mich.-based CMS said it stopped "wash" trades, in which
traders buy and resell electricity without profit or loss, in
mid-January. The company said an internal review found the bogus
trades accounted for nearly 80% of electricity traded in 2001, and
more than 70% the year before.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it restated revenue and expenses downward by
$3.4 billion for the first three quarters of 2001, which was
reflected in its annual filing done in March.</LD>
<TE>   All CMS trades were done with units of Dynegy Inc. and Reliant
Resources Inc., leading energy trading companies that already have
acknowledged the sham transactions. Revelation of the bogus trades
last week sent the shares of all three companies plunging.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy fell 9% to $8.35 and Reliant Resources fell nearly 11% to
$7.73, but shares CMS rose 20 cents to $17.23.</TE>
<TE>   CMS said the bogus trades had no effect on its earnings, cash flow
or balance sheet for 2001 or 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Financier Martin Frankel, who bilked insurance companies in five
states out of about $200 million, pleaded guilty to federal charges
of racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as they try to
recover assets he stole from the insurers. He appeared in federal
court in New Haven, Conn., to agree to the deal.</LD>
<LD>   He could face up to 150 years in prison and $6.5 million in fines
but prosecutors are expected to agree to a shorter sentence as long
as Frankel lives up to his pledge to cooperate.</LD>

<LD>   New York-based Pfizer said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that the Justice Department is examining whether grants to
health plans and pharmacy benefit managers should qualify as rebates.</LD>
<LD>   That would entitle the government to a bigger discount on the drug
under best-price rules for Medicaid. The investigation is among
several recent federal inquiries and state and consumer lawsuits on
drug pricing.</LD>

<LD>Payless ShoeSource Inc. said that its fiscal first-quarter earnings
fell 20% after the company underestimated demand for warm-weather
footwear and that second-quarter profit may beat estimates as the
largest U.S. shoe retailer stocks more sandals and open-toe shoes.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the period ended May 4 fell to $23.9 million, or
$1.05 a share, from $29.7 million, or $1.30, a year earlier. Sales
fell 3.9% to $738.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Steven J. Douglass said in a conference call that
the company didn't have enough sandals and other open-toe footwear in
its stores in the first quarter, and that shortage is being
corrected.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Topeka, Kan.-based Payless rose $1.30, or 2.3%, to
$58.20 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonicblue Inc. won a stay of a court order that would have forced it
to track the television viewing habits of people using its ReplayTV
digital video recorder. Movie studios including Viacom Inc.'s
Paramount and Walt Disney Co., as well as TV networks including
General Electric Co.'s NBC, have sued the company, alleging features
of the ReplayTV allow people to violate their copyrights. The order
was stayed until June 3, when a judge is expected to address
Sonicblue's motion to throw out the magistrate's order.</LD>

<HD>WorldCom to Tap $2.65 Billion in Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone and data
services company, said it will tap a $2.65-billion bank credit line,
gaining a cash cushion and bargaining leverage as it negotiates with
lenders on a new, larger credit pact. The move will give WorldCom
extra time as it tries to line up $5 billion in loans that will be
secured by the company's assets.</LD>
<LD>   As WorldCom taps the $2.65 billion, which is unsecured, its banks
become exposed to any potential deterioration in its finances or a
further downturn in the volatile telecom sector. Analysts said that
puts more pressure on the banks to give WorldCom the new $5-billion
credit line because the company would put up its assets as collateral
and repay the $2.65-billion loan. WorldCom expects to get the new
funding in June.</LD>

<LD>Qwest Communications Inc. was fined $900,000 by Minnesota regulators
for engaging in anti-competitive behavior, the Denver Post and Rocky
Mountain News reported. Steve Davis, Qwest senior vice president of
policy and law, called the ruling a "miscarriage of justice" and said
Qwest will appeal. Several states also are looking into allegations
by AT&amp;T Corp. that Qwest engaged in anti-competitive behavior by
signing secret, favorable agreements with small wholesalers. Qwest
has defended its agreements as proper, reports said.</LD>

companies such as Bertelsmann and Vivendi Universal.</LD>

on legislation to help Web sites that play music and to see that

<HD>IBM Chief Hints at Possible Job Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. Chief Executive Sam Palmisano said the world's largest
computer maker needs to cut costs ahead of the elusive rebound in
technology spending. Palmisano hinted in his first address to Wall
Street analysts of pending job cuts and "adjustments" in the
semiconductor business.</LD>
<LD>   He committed to cutting $1 billion to $2 billion of costs this
year and in following years and said the company was fixing the
businesses that have dogged its growth in recent years, such as
personal computers and hard disk drives. Analysts found Palmisano,
who spoke after the markets closed, short on specifics; one said he
thought the share price would fall as a result. IBM shares fell 98
cents to $84.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<DH>Peterson, Cowles key to Riverside Poly's chances</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Peterson is a muscular catcher, a senior with a lot of
intensity and a knack for occasionally being less-than-diplomatic.</LD>
<LD>   Mindy Cowles is a slender pitcher, a sophomore with a
happy-go-lucky attitude and a penchant for practical jokes.</LD>
<LD>   When the first round of the Southern Section softball playoffs get
underway on Friday, Riverside Poly will rely heavily on its
odd-couple battery, which is one of the best in the Southland.</LD>
<TE>   Poly is the No. 2-seeded team in Division II, which is loaded with
most of the region's top teams. The Bears will be trying to prove
they belong in such company by reaching the finals for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   They blew through their regular-season schedule with a 24-2
record, won their fifth Ivy League title in six years and, until last
week, had won 19 games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But their schedule has not been nearly as tough as some of the
other top-ranked schools. Poly faced only two teams that have been
ranked in the top 25 by The Times. In consecutive games the first
week of the season, the Bears defeated Corona Santiago, 5-4, and lost
to Orange El Modena, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "That [schedule] is something I have to live with," said Eddie
Jones, in his 12th season as coach. He says he began an upgrade of
the schedule this season that will continue next year for a team that
is expected to lose only two starters.</TE>
<TE>   At Poly's core this season are Peterson and Cowles.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, one of the top catchers in the state, has signed with
Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   She enters the playoffs batting .500 with a .728 on-base
percentage, five home runs and 25 runs batted in. She has scored 21
runs, accounting for more than 35% of her team's total while batting
third in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, who calls all the pitches, is a defensive standout.
Jones said there have been no passed balls and, because of Peterson's
considerable skills, Cowles has only two wild pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone's attempted to steal on her since she was a
freshman," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was exaggerating.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone tried to steal on me last Thursday," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   And?</TE>
<TE>   "They were out," she said. "The key word is 'tried.'"</TE>
<TE>   Peterson can't remember the last time someone stole a base against
her, and her reputation clearly keeps activity on the base paths
down.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unassuming nickname of "Binky," Peterson has an
intense personality that sometimes gets the best of her.</TE>
<TE>   "I will bite your head off," she acknowledged. "I can understand
physical errors, but mental error after mental error? Oh my god, make
an adjustment!</TE>
<TE>   "I have so many people who expect me to do my job, when they don't
do theirs, I get extremely mad."</TE>
<TE>   But her teammates seem to understand.</TE>
<TE>   "She's kind of like another coach," Cowles said. "We know the only
reason she gets on us is that she's trying to help us."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has found himself serving as peacemaker on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some talks as a team based on some things that were
said in the heat of the battle," he said. "It gets worked out.
Everybody understands what she's bringing to the table. Other kids
have said, 'Sometimes I need to be that intense.'</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to play the game for two hours, you better be
into it because [Peterson's] going to ask you to bring everything
you've got."</TE>
<TE>   It's that intensity that has driven Peterson to become the player
she is, from her days practicing with her father and older brother at
La Sierra Park, to focusing on an 0-2 pitch from Santiago's Taryne
Mowatt and driving it 260 feet, over a 20-foot fence, in the Corona
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Cowles has, perhaps, benefited most from Peterson's intensity. On
the field, they are similarly focused.</TE>
<TE>   Cowles is 20-2 and has a 0.63 earned-run average. She has a .348
batting average, has scored 24 runs and has 11 RBIs batting leadoff
in front of sophomore center fielder Liz Caputo, a .451 hitter who
has scored 22 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Though Peterson and Cowles may have different personalities, at
their heart, they are the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both leaders," Cowles said. "We're both competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to win. We hate to lose."</TE>

<LD>On the occasion of Venus Williams injuring her right wrist by picking
up her racket bag, Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel reviews some
of the most ignominious injuries in sports history.</LD>
<LD>   He includes one caveat: Sometimes, the athlete is lying.</LD>
<LD>   Selections from Greene's hall of shame:</LD>
<TE>   * Football, Turk Edwards. "This goes back to 1940 when the Hall of
Fame tackle for Washington never played again after wrenching a knee.
I know, nothing seems odd about that--except he did it during the
coin toss."</TE>
<TE>   * Baseball, Glenallen Hill. "And then there was Mr. Hill, who once
fell through a glass table. He says it happened when he jumped out of
bed because he was dreaming that spiders were eating him."</TE>
<TE>   * Baseball, Roger Craig. "The manager once cut his hand--on a bra
strap. Men find that admirable ... as long as it wasn't his bra
strap."</TE>
<TE>   And the winner is: The honor goes to Vince Coleman, the St. Louis
Cardinal who left the 1985 National League championship series on a
stretcher after the tarp machine rolled over his leg.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What current Laker was drafted ahead of Kobe Bryant
in 1996?</TE>
<TE>   The inside dirt: Few players have enjoyed the by-play of baseball
as much as Steve Lyons, the former Chicago White Sox and Boston Red
Sox player who is a Fox television analyst.</TE>
<TE>   He used to use his spikes to leave messages in the dirt for
opposing infielders, even challenging them to games of tic-tac-toe.</TE>
<TE>   "I played with anyone who played with me," he told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. "Only two guys wouldn't play, Fred McGriff and a
guy from Baltimore whose name I can't remember. I used to joke that
maybe they didn't know the rules."</TE>
<TE>   One fellow he didn't get anything by was Harold Reynolds, the
former Seattle second baseman who is an ESPN analyst.</TE>
<TE>   While playing second base, Lyons drew a line to the back edge of
the dirt, marked it with an 'X' and wrote, "Can you get to a ball way
out here?"</TE>
<TE>   The next inning, Lyons hit a ball to that exact spot. Reynolds
threw him out.</TE>
<TE>   When Lyons returned to second, he found one word scratched in the
dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Religious fervor: Nolan Richardson, the fired Arkansas basketball
coach, talked with Frank Burlison of Foxsports.com recently about the
meeting that led to his controversial departure.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson found the conclusion of his session with Athletic
Director Frank Broyles and Chancellor John A. White particularly
galling.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that made me angry is [White] wanted to pray with me
after it was over," he said. "He had no right to do that. [He said,]
'Dear Lord, this is a great man ... '</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Wait a minute!' He fired my [butt], hung me by the neck,
and now he's going to pray for me?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Samaki Walker was drafted ninth by Dallas. Bryant
was selected 13th by Charlotte before being traded to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ron Wilson, on being fired as Washington Capital
coach partly because the players tuned him out:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm human too, and as much as they probably shut me out, I was
probably shutting out some of the players too," he told the
Washington Post.</TE>

<PH>NBA PLAYOFFS WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS Game 1: Lakers at
Sacramento, Saturday, 3:30 p.m., Ch. 4</PH>
<KH>J.A. Adande</KH>
<HD>Lakers Have Proved That They Know How to Take It to the
Next Level</HD>
<DH>When it comes down to the Shaq and Kobe Lakers against the
up-tempo Kings, the favorite might be decided on ...  STYLE POINTS</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back up. Go retro. Look over your shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers believe they'll move forward because of where they've
been in the past. They've gone through all the necessary stages of
suffering and they've triumphed after the hardest tests.</LD>
<LD>   It took more than nine minutes into his discourse on all aspects
of the Western Conference finals, but Rick Fox got to the essence of
why his Lakers think they will beat the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<TE>   "This series, we play off of our experience," Fox said. "We play
off of the fact that we've had success in [Arco] Arena."</TE>
<TE>   Normally you put the Lakers up against any team and the difference
comes down to the fact that the Lakers have Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant and the other team doesn't. That's what happened with the San
Antonio Spurs. At times Tim Duncan was as good as either Laker
superstar, but he couldn't down them both.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can't match megastars, but they throw a bigger, deeper
package at the Lakers. Start with three guys who need minimal
identification: CWebb, Vlade and Peja. They also can hit you with
Bobby Jackson, Mike Bibby, Hedo Turkoglu and Doug Christie. Add the
whole crew up and they put more points on the board than any other
team in the league this season.</TE>
<TE>   They have home-court advantage. They have all kinds of incentive,
and the directive from their cowbell-clanging fans to "Beat L.A."</TE>
<TE>   But--with the exception of Vlade Divac, who went to the NBA Finals
his rookie year with the Lakers in 1991--they just don't have the
experience of playing in the conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between a conference semifinal and a
conference final," Derek Fisher said. "We feel like we understand
that."</TE>
<TE>   The hardest knocks come from the conference playoffs, where
everybody knows each other so well. You have to beat everybody on
your block before you can start challenging people from different
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   That's the Law of the West now. It used to be that way in the
East, when the Celtics, then the Pistons, then the Bulls, stood in
front of the gate, taking a toll on anyone who tried to pass through
to the NBA Finals. Anyone aspiring to glory first had to line up and
take their lumps. Pat Riley called it the Principle of Painful
Progression.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq went through it in both sides. He went home after getting
swept in five of his first six playoff appearances with the Orlando
Magic, then the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The core group of Lakers in the Shaq and Kobe era went through it.
They lost in the conference semifinals to Utah in their first
go-round, the 1997 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   They beat the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round the next
year, everyone proclaimed them the next thing, called Shaq the next
Wilt Chamberlain and prepared for L.A.'s return to the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Then they got swept by the Utah Jazz in the conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we'd really done something," Fisher said. "We got to
Utah, and they put us right back in our place.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't understand where you are, sometimes it's hard to
go out and relax and play. We feel like we understand where we are
and what it takes to keep your composure and stay poised in
situations like these. Hopefully our experience will give us the edge
down the stretch in these games."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can't rely on that. And they'd better not get too
comfortable with their home-court advantage. For all of the talk of
the decibel levels at Arco Arena and how much better it makes the
Kings, this group is only 7-6 at home in the playoffs the past four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're up against a team that has won 11 consecutive road
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the series begins in Arco on Saturday, it will be the
Kings who are on unfamiliar ground. It sure showed the way they
celebrated their series-clinching victory over the Dallas Mavericks,
when Bobby Jackson donned some sort of divisional championship hat
(they make those?) and owners Joe and Gavin Maloof danced away.</TE>
<TE>   "This is new for a lot of them," said Fox, who caught their
celebratory act on television. "I saw a team that was in the moment
of winning the second round and going to their first Western
Conference finals. I can recall the first time we did it, it was a
big moment for us, exciting, move on. But in every case--and they'll
understand this as we move on here--each step brings a different
level of basketball. It's a level that's incomprehensible until
you're there, until you experience it. That's what's going to be the
true telling sign of this series."</TE>
<TE>   I think that's what it comes down to. You can't say that the Kings
won't win because Webber, their best player, isn't a classic go-to
guy. I say it doesn't matter because they have so many other guys who
can make big shots.</TE>
<TE>   You can't say they're too erratic, not after Bibby replaced Jason
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring is certainly proving to be a more difficult task for the
Lakers than the Kings, especially with O'Neal hurting from finger to
toe and no longer the automatic option he once was.</TE>
<TE>   Quite simply, the Lakers know the drill.</TE>
<TE>   What we saw when the Bulls three-peated was their collective
knowledge carrying them. They always staggered to the finish line,
their third championships getting scratched out by their final
reserves of willpower.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been to the top twice in the last two years. Don't
think they suddenly forget how to get there.</TE>
<TE>   Lakers in six.</TE>

<HD>Streaking Red Sox Shut Down A's Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston's Derek Lowe kept silencing hitters and Oakland Manager Art
Howe decided it was time to talk to his struggling team.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe gave up six hits in eight innings and took over the AL lead
with a 2.16 earned-run average as the Red Sox won, 8-2, Wednesday
night at Boston, handing the Athletics their 10th loss in 12 games.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like every day I'm going to go out there I'm going to
win," Lowe said in his first start at Fenway Park since pitching the
first no-hitter there since 1965. "I've prepared all off-season to
have a good year."</LD>
<TE>   Lowe (6-1), who struggled as a closer last year, beat Oakland for
the second time in six days. In his previous start, he retired 11 of
the last 12 batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't as sharp this time." Howe said. "I thought in all our
other losses we battled. This one we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   So he held a team meeting after the game.</TE>
<TE>   It had "been a long time coming," Eric Chavez said. "I don't think
any of us were shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Boston is 10-2 in its last 12 games, 3-0 without injured slugger
Manny Ramirez, and has the best record in the majors, 27-9.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 10, New York 7--Chris Gomez hit a three-run homer to cap
Tampa Bay's biggest opening inning ever, a six-run first against
Orlando Hernandez, and the Devil Rays hung on at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Cox added two homers as Tampa Bay took a 9-0 lead in the
fourth inning and survived New York's comeback attempt. The Devil
Rays snapped the Yankees' seven-game winning streak and their
eight-game losing streak against New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay had lost 16 of 18 games and been outscored, 40-10, in
its last eight games against the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 8, Toronto 6--Bret Boone hit a go-ahead, two-run double in
the ninth inning at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud homered and had three RBIs for the Mariners, who
overcame a 5-0 deficit. Seattle is a major-league best 15-3 on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Hinske, Felipe Lopez and Jose Cruz Jr. homered for the Blue
Jays, who have lost eight of their last 10 at SkyDome.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 3, Baltimore 1--Bartolo Colon pitched eight strong
innings at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Branyan hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning off Rick
Bauer (1-1) when the Indians ended a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland loaded the bases on two singles and a walk before
Branyan, who had been 0 for 6 with the bases loaded and had left 14
runners in scoring position in those spots this season, hit his
sacrifice fly to deep center.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Kansas City 6--Jacque Jones homered twice and drove
in four runs at Kansas City, Mo., ruining Tony Pena's debut as the
Royal manager.</TE>
<TE>   The former NL All-Star catcher, hired earlier in the day off the
staff of the Houston Astros, saw one of his first managerial moves
fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 4-4 in the sixth and two runners on base, he
summoned rookie Brian Shouse to face Jones, who hit a 2-and-0 pitch
over the wall in right.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 5, Chicago 2--Michael Young homered and Ismael Valdes
combined with two relievers on a two-hitter at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez was ejected in the seventh inning for bumping an
umpire after a close call at first base. The contact appeared to be
accidental, but first-base umpire Mike DiMuro wasn't budging no
matter how much Rodriguez protested.</TE>
<TE>   With or without Rodriguez, though, the Rangers had little trouble
getting their 12th victory in the last 16 games.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Simply Divine in 10-1 Win Over Tigers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The good folks at St. John's Episcopal Church, across the street from
Comerica Park, were thoughtful enough to hang a large white banner
near the front door of the church.</LD>
<LD>   "Pray Here for the Tigers," the banner reads.</LD>
<LD>   Couldn't hurt. The Tigers grounded into a double play, dropped a
fly ball, threw two wild pitches and gave up three unearned runs
Wednesday--all in the first two innings.</LD>
<TE>   The Tigers are so bad right now, and the Angels are so good, that
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia actually won an argument with the umpires
during a 10-1 victory Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty good," first baseman Scott Spiezio said. "He goes
out there a lot, but he doesn't come back a winner too often."</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein and Brad Fullmer hit home runs to support Aaron
Sele, who delivered his best start of the season as the Angels won
their seventh consecutive game. They also won for the 16th time in 18
tries, the best 18-game run in team history and one in which they
have outscored opponents, 143-50.</TE>
<TE>   If they win tonight, the Angels will have two eight-game winning
streaks in the same season for the first time in team history.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the type of team we knew we had in spring training," Sele
said. "You don't expect to go on a run like this one. But the
combination of steady defense, steady pitching and steady offense is
what everybody saw in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers, steady only in their consistently poor play, lost
their seventh consecutive game and own the worst record in the major
leagues, worse even than the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Milwaukee
Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   Sele, billed as a consumer of innings when the Angels signed him
to a $24-million free-agent contract in December, pitched seven
innings for the first time this season. Sele had pitches to spare in
the sixth and seventh innings because he did not exhaust himself in
the first.</TE>
<TE>   He had given up at least two runs in the first inning of each of
his last three starts, and this one appeared no better when the
Tigers put runners on first and third with one out in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   But Dmitri Young grounded into a double play, and as Sele returned
to the dugout his teammates rose to greet him with laughter and
high-fives on the occasion of a scoreless first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Sele did not give up another hit until the fifth inning. He did
not give up a run until the sixth inning, by which time the Angels
had scored seven. Sele (4-2) gave up six hits over seven innings,
winning his fourth consecutive start and lowering his earned-run
average to 5.10.</TE>
<TE>   "This was definitely his best start," Scioscia said. "We knew it
was going to come. But he's been keeping us in ballgames, even if he
gets scored on early."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein is the only Angel to start every game in the field this
season, and Scioscia talked before the game of the possibility of
giving him a day off. He entered Wednesday's game in a one-for-13
slump, and his batting average had dropped to a season-low .273.</TE>
<TE>   Cancel the day off. He reached base three times, on a walk, single
and the home run.</TE>
<TE>   The homer was his third of the season, more than every teammate
except Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus and Tim Salmon. He had four home
runs last season, ranking 11th on the team. Jeff DaVanon, who started
25 games, hit more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something I'm going to be doing. Don't expect that from
me," said Eckstein, who pointed out that he has hit all three of his
home runs down the left-field line.</TE>
<TE>   "Those balls aren't clearing by much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia won his argument when he pointed out that Bengie Molina
should have been allowed to advance two bases, not one, when a wild
pitch bounded into the Detroit dugout. Umpires based their original
ruling on Detroit catcher Michael Rivera's stopping the ball before
it entered the dugout, then consulted with each other and agreed that
Rivera's force had carried him--and hence the ball--into the dugout.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>It Seems Only Strike Could Slow Them</HD>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos had the best record in the major leagues when
players went on strike in August 1994. The rest of the season was
canceled, the most talented and most expensive players were
subsequently abandoned in trades or free agency, and local interest
and revenue have waned to the point where the Expos are expected to
be moved or eliminated after this season.</LD>
<LD>   A strike this summer would not threaten the survival of the
Angels, but it would dampen interest in the suddenly revitalized
team. The Angels are the hottest team in baseball, winners in 16 of
their last 18 games, and they appear to have a legitimate chance to
make their first playoff appearance since 1986--unless, that is,
another strike cancels the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's on our minds, but it's way in the back," said pitcher Jarrod
Washburn, one of the Angel representatives to the players' union.
"What's on the front of our minds is that this could be our year. We
have high expectations. We want to make the playoffs. If something
happens that prevents that--well, hopefully, that doesn't happen."</LD>
<TE>   With negotiations for a new labor agreement sputtering, the union
has acknowledged discussing options that include setting a strike
date, most likely in August.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the last thing we want," Washburn said. "We hope it
doesn't come to that, but we have to plan for it."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Impemba, the radio play-by-play voice of the Angels for
seven years, moved here this spring to become the television
play-by-play voice for the Tigers. His wife and two children planned
to follow this summer, after the school year ended in Orange County,
but the temporary separation didn't dampen Impemba's enthusiasm about
calling the games of his hometown Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Then the season started, and the Tigers lost their first 11 games.
Was Impemba just a little bit nostalgic for his old job?</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels got off to such a bad start that it wasn't much better
out there," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, none of that stuff had any effect on me. I was
adjusting to a new job and being away from my wife and kids. I
couldn't worry about how many games the team was losing. That got me
through it.</TE>
<TE>   "But, still, the first score I look at every morning is the Angel
score."</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels leading, 8-1, in the ninth inning Wednesday and
Darin Erstad on first base, Troy Glaus doubled. Erstad probably could
have scored, but coach Ron Roenicke held him at third base. The score
was a factor, but this wasn't just a coaching decision made out of
mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke said he also was concerned that Erstad, who missed eight
days while recovering from a concussion and who still hurls his body
in every direction in the field and on the bases, would risk another
injury in the unlikely event of a play at home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not worth sending him and having him slide into the
catcher," Roenicke said. "I always want to get a guy an RBI, but not
when there's a chance somebody could get hurt, and you know Erstad
isn't going to go in there soft."</TE>

<HD>Pena Is Hired as Manager of Royals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Pena the manager promises to be just as tough and combative as
Tony Pena the All-Star catcher.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe you go out and play hard baseball," said the new Kansas
City Royals' manager, renowned during his 18-year career as one of
the major leagues' most aggressive players.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe in that. There will be rules and we're going to have to
follow the rules."</LD>
<TE>   A five-time All-Star with Pittsburgh and St. Louis, the
44-year-old Pena was introduced Wednesday as the replacement for Tony
Muser, who was fired April 29.</TE>
<TE>   Hired off the staff of the Houston Astros, Pena signed through the
2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled broadly when asked what his first message to his players
would be.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the new DJ. I play the music," he said. "You are to dance.
If you don't know how to dance, get off of the dance floor."</TE>
<TE>   Said catcher A.J. Hinch: "That's really what he said to us. We
really got a kick out of it. We've known him for 20 minutes and we
can see he's got a great personality.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the transition is going to be fine."</TE>
<TE>   *Tampa Bay optioned right-hander Jesus Colome to triple-A Durham,
one day after his wildness nearly led to a brawl with the New York
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Colome, 24, has a 1-3 record with 14 walks and 25 hits allowed in
14 innings this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto traded pitcher Pedro Borbon to the Astros for a player to
be named.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland pitcher Chuck Finley and his wife, actress Tawny Kitaen,
accused each other of domestic violence and drug abuse in court
documents filed May 2 in Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Petitioning to regain custody of their two children, Kitaen
claimed that Finley started a fight that led to her arrest in April.
She also accused him of alcohol and drug abuse, and said he took
steroids.</TE>
<TE>   In his petition to keep custody of the children, Finley alleged
that Kitaen's "acts of domestic violence and chronic drug abuse place
the children at risk."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,

exception: No products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: "Outside the Lines: Simulating Sports--the Video Game Craze"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, Friday, 4:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   This one-hour show explores all the angles of the global
$20-billion video-game industry, touching on the fun parts as well as
the troubling parts. The show was originally scheduled to air tonight
but was pushed back a day because of Game 1 of the Toronto-Carolina
NHL series.</TE>
<TE>   Although ESPN and its parent company, Disney, are involved in the
business, the show and its host, Bob Ley, don't shy away from being
critical. Well examined is the effect that the violent and sexual
content of some games have on young children. Also dealt with is the
questionable rating system that is supposed to give guidance to
parents. An E rating means a game is for everyone, T is for teens, M
is mature and AO is adults only.</TE>
<TE>   Targeted for violent content are two Midway-produced games, NFL
Blitz 2002, billed as a game of "no refs, no rules, no mercy," and
NHL Hitz 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't figure out why they carry an E rating, because they
promote violence and they promote cheating," says child psychologist
David Walsh. "How that can be appropriate for kids is beyond me."</TE>
<TE>   The first segment is about how popular video games are among pro
athletes, with the Clippers' Darius Miles and Elton Brand featured.</TE>
<TE>   World Series hero Luis Gonzalez is featured in one segment. And in
another, Tiger Woods and John Madden talk about their rather
significant roles in the games they endorse.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Hits Keep On Not Coming</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Mets shut them out on two hits for the second
night in a row, 2-0. Ishii takes first defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers held a position players-only meeting before Wednesday
night's game against the New York Mets, presumably to discuss ways to
jump-start their anemic offense. Only someone forgot the cables.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger bats remained as dead as the car on the frozen lake in
those old commercials--the one without the Die-Hard battery--and they
were shut out for the eighth time this season in a 2-0 loss to the
Mets before 31,995 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   New York right-hander Jeff D'Amico--or was that Walter
Johnson?--blanked the Dodgers on two hits and struck out eight for a
complete-game victory, as the Dodgers were shut out for the second
consecutive night and matched their shutout total for the 2001 season
in the first month and a half of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii (6-1) suffered his first loss as a
Dodger despite giving up one run and four hits in seven innings, the
rotation's 28th quality start in 40 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers, who also managed only two hits against Pedro
Astacio on Tuesday, extended their scoreless innings streak to
18--they have one run their last 26 innings--and failed to score
three runs or more for the 23rd time this season and the 14th time in
the last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   They grounded into their major league-leading 50th double play
Wednesday night, putting them on a pace to shatter the franchise
record of 145 set in 1979. They hit six balls out of the infield, and
No. 3 batter Shawn Green, who took a fastball down the middle for
strike three to end the game, didn't hit a ball out of the infield in
three games against New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were retired in order in 17 of 31 innings during the
series. They've hit six home runs in the last 21 games and 22 on the
season, ranking 15th in the National League in that department.</TE>
<TE>   "This small ball is getting a little old," second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "All these one-run and two-run games ... they give
you headaches, they drive you nuts. We need to break open a few games
and ease the minds of not only the pitchers, but the whole team."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitchers don't need much. The team is 22-5 in games in
which it has scored three runs or more. That means it is 0-13 when it
doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "That gives you an idea that we don't have to score seven or eight
runs a night to be competitive," Manager Jim Tracy said. "Hitting is
a cyclical thing, and we're in a valley right now. Our pitching and
defense are good, but we've got to hit and score some runs. That's
what's keeping this team from being special; it's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   A split-second decision by Dodger shortstop Cesar Izturis didn't
cost the Dodgers the game Wednesday night, but it played a role in
the Mets' first run.</TE>
<TE>   Edgardo Alfonzo opened the second inning with a double to
right-center field and took third on Jeromy Burnitz's grounder to
second. With the middle infielders playing halfway, Jay Payton
bounced a grounder to short.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis charged the ball and wanted to throw home, but he
double-clutched as he tried to get a grip on the ball and opted to go
to first. Alfonzo scored, giving the Mets their third consecutive RBI
in the series on a ball that didn't leave the infield.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets then broke the game open in the eighth--two runs is about
all you need against the Dodgers these days--when Mo Vaughn, the
former Angel, golfed a low-and-inside Giovanni Carrara pitch into the
right-field seats for his third home run of the season and a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers advanced only one runner to third, and that was only
because of an error. Green walked with one out in the fourth, and
Paul Lo Duca lined out to shortstop Rey Ordonez, whose throw in an
attempt to double up Green sailed past first and into a
photographer's well for a two-base error.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers, who entered batting .255 with runners in scoring
position and .221 with runners in scoring position and two outs,
failed to capitalize when Eric Karros flied to center. They also had
two on with one out in the second, but Adrian Beltre swung at the
first pitch and bounced into a 6-4-3 double play.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a questionable offense this year, and we're struggling,
so there's your angle, it makes your job easy," Karros told reporters
afterward. "We just have to go out there each day with a clean slate.
It doesn't matter what you did yesterday or last year. That's how you
have to approach it."</TE>

<LD>Left fielder Brian Jordan was unavailable Wednesday night, the second
consecutive game he sat out after straining his lower back while
fielding a ball, stopping suddenly and throwing on the rubber-like
warning track Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Though Jordan's injury is not believed to be serious enough to
send him to the disabled list, it renewed debate about the surface
that surrounds the field, which was installed to alleviate irrigation
problems during the stadium renovation in 2000 but has sparked
numerous complaints from players.</LD>
<LD>   "Your cleats just stick to it," second baseman Mark Grudzielanek
said. "It definitely could pose a danger because it's like a rubber
mat--it grips you real quick, and there's no give to it. When your
foot doesn't move, your knee could rotate and pop. You definitely
have to look out for it."</LD>
<TE>   A team official said it's very unlikely the Dodgers would consider
replacing the rubber surface with dirt, clay or gravel, and Manager
Jim Tracy hasn't pushed for a change--yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to get into the cosmetics of the ballpark," Tracy
said. "If it gets to a point where it becomes enough of an issue
where it needs to be seriously discussed, it will be. In the
meantime, I'll let the stadium operations people do their job, and
I'll do mine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, the Dodgers' union representative, has not been
involved in discussions between owners and players on a new
collective bargaining agreement, so he was stunned to hear that union
officials have talked about setting a strike date.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," Grudzielanek said. "We don't want to strike, but if that's
what it takes, if that's the last resort, and we're all in agreement,
we have to do it. Hopefully it won't come to that. We don't need it,
the fans don't need it, and the game of baseball would really be hurt
by that."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's last work stoppage resulted in cancellation of the 1994
World Series, but the sport, despite predictions to the contrary,
somehow survived. But can it weather another stoppage?</TE>
<TE>   "We'll survive," Grudzielanek said of the players. "Will the game
of baseball survive? I don't know. You take that chance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed reliever Jesse Orosco was put on the 15-day disabled
list because of a strained oblique muscle.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers recalled right-hander Guillermo Mota, who is 1-1 with
a 2.91 ERA at triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were forced to release triple-A catcher Todd Greene,
who was batting .352 with 11 homers, and 41 RBIs in 12 games for Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, a former Angel, signed a minor league contract with an out
clause that allowed him to become a free agent if the Dodgers didn't
call him up by May 15. Greene exercised that option Wednesday and
will pursue a job with another team.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good player, but we didn't have a spot for him today,"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "We weren't going to make a move just
because of a deadline."</TE>

<HD>Ocean Trails' 18th Hole Could Become Playable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The saga of the world's most expensive golf hole has taken an
unexpected twist, but it may finally lead to the completion of Ocean
Trails Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes.</LD>
<LD>   The 18th hole at Ocean Trails was severely damaged by a June 1999
landslide, weeks before the course was to open. A project to rebuild
the hole began in November 2000 but was halted four months ago
because of a lack of funds.</LD>
<LD>   Brothers Ken and Bob Zuckerman, the course owners, filed for
bankruptcy protection after the landslide, but a bankruptcy judge
stripped them of ownership in February and Credit Suisse First Boston
took control of the course last week and will maintain ownership
until the 18th hole is rebuilt.</LD>
<TE>   What it all means is that reconstruction of the 18th hole is set
to start again within days.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told that the hole can be completed by fall," said Mike
Lynn, Ocean Trails director of sales and marketing. "I think it's
safe to say that it will be complete by the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Rebuilding the hole caused major problems for the Zuckermans, who
fought environmental agencies and insurance companies as well as the
banks and courts over the last three years. Ken Zuckerman said the
course was starting to turn a profit, but the lenders finally cashed
in their marker.</TE>
<TE>   "The bank yanked the rug out from under me," he said. "We finally
looked like we were meeting our projection numbers, but the bank
moved quickly to get me out. It's a huge loss. I spent 12 years with
that project, and now I'm out on my ear."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn said the Pete Dye-designed course had an original
construction price tag of about $100 million, but the 18th hole has
cost an additional $60 million. Many upscale courses in California
are built for about $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The course is still operating as a 15-hole layout with green fees
ranging from $35-$110 depending on the day and the time. Play has
been moderate, but Lynn said golfers want to see the finished
product.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are getting anxious for a full 18," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Buy These</TE>
<TE>   They might not be going to the lengths of the angry golf course
architect played by John Cleese in Titleist television commercials,
but real-life golf course architects are speaking out against modern
golf technology.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Morrish, president of the American Society of Golf Course
Architects, delivered a passionate address during a conference last
week at the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa in which he implored equipment
manufacturers to slow down or else players would soon be hitting
400-yard drives and many golf courses would become obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't have that," Morrish said. "We have to stop this
somewhere. We have to draw the line. We're not trying to be
unreasonable, but let's make a game of it again."</TE>
<TE>   Morrish said that new technology has turned golf into a
driver-pitching wedge game at the professional level and is forcing
major renovations at older, traditional courses. He cited Cherry
Hills Country Club in Colorado, which hosted the U.S. Open in 1938,
'60 and '78 but, at 7,160 yards, is too short by today's standards.</TE>
<TE>   "I would seriously doubt that they will ever play another [men's]
major there because of the length," Morrish said. "It's sad. It's a
great course."</TE>
<TE>   Morrish vowed to become more vocal on the issue and encouraged
course designers to refrain from building longer courses.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do something besides lengthen [the courses] to 7,500
yards," he said. "I will always maintain that a great golf course
demands all 14 clubs. We're not using all the clubs in the bag
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Clubs</TE>
<TE>   The swoosh Tiger Woods makes on his downswing is soon to become
much more pronounced.</TE>
<TE>   Woods will begin using Nike Golf irons before the end of this
season and possibly before the U.S. Open next month, Nike Golf
President Bob Wood confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has been experimenting with Nike irons "for quite a while,"
Wood said, and the No. 1 golfer in the world is very close to using
them in competition.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't make the switch until he is 100% sure he's ready," Wood
said. "It's been a little trial-and-error period for the last few
months, but at some point he is going to jump off the diving board."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who currently uses Titleist irons, has an endorsement
contract worth a reported $100 million with Nike, but the switch is
not required in that deal, Wood said. Woods began using a Nike driver
in February.</TE>
<TE>   An equipment switch just before a major is not unprecedented for
Woods, who switched to a Nike ball just before the 2000 U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach and won the tournament by 15 strokes.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval, John Cook and Bryce Molder use Nike Golf irons on the
PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Penick Enshrined</TE>
<TE>   Legendary golf instructor Harvey Penick, author of "Harvey
Penick's Little Red Book," has been selected to the World Golf Hall
of Fame through the lifetime achievement category.</TE>
<TE>   Penick, who died at 90 in 1995, will be inducted Nov. 15 at the
World Golf Village near St. Augustine, Fla. His students include Hall
of Famers Ben Crenshaw, Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, Kathy Whitworth,
plus Tom Kite and Davis Love III.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame he couldn't have gotten in when he was alive, but
obviously this is still a great honor," Kite said.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw, who broke down in tears when he won the 1995 Masters
days after Penick's death, will be inducted on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Shootout Field Set</TE>
<TE>   Fred Couples, Phil Mickelson, Lee Trevino and Arnold Palmer will
play in the fourth annual Par-3 Shootout at Treetops Resort in
Gaylord, Mich., on July 1-2. Trevino is defending champion of the
$540,000 made-for-TV event that offers a $1-million bonus to anyone
who makes a hole in one. Trevino scored an ace last year.</TE>
<TE>   New Venue for Friends</TE>
<TE>   The Michael Douglas and Friends Celebrity Golf Tournament is
moving to the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa. The tournament, which had
attracted such celebrities as Kevin Costner, Jack Nicholson, Will
Smith, Joe Pesci, Sidney Poitier and James Woods, had been played at
Ocean Trails the last three years. It will be taped June 30 and shown
July 21 immediately after the British Open on Channel 7. Tickets:

<HD>Herges Still Feels Blue</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Despite his success with surprising Expos,
pitcher questions why Dodgers traded him in spring training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It has been almost two months since he was traded and Matt Herges has
a team-high six saves for the surprising Montreal Expos.</LD>
<LD>   But the feel-good story of the contraction-threatened team from
Canada can't erase the hurt for Herges, who was dealt away by the
Dodgers in a four-player trade near the end of spring training.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm still not over it. No way," Herges said Wednesday before the
Expos' game against the San Diego Padres. "Just the fact that I gave
everything I had to the Dodgers and bought into it big-time. I kind
of felt abandoned."</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, Herges could face his old teammates for the first time
when the Expos open a four-game series at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It will be an emotional homecoming for a player who signed with
the Dodgers as a non-drafted free agent in 1992 and spent nearly
eight full seasons in the minor leagues before his first call-up in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Herges, 33, was used primarily as a setup man for Jeff Shaw in
2000 and 2001 when he went a combined 20-11 with a 3.30 earned-run
average in 210 innings. He was also one of the most popular players
on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Herges has maintained contact with several former teammates and
anticipates heart-tugging moments from the time he arrives at Dodger
Stadium this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to see everyone I'm used to seeing at the stadium and
hug a lot of people," Herges said. "It's going to be tough. We'll see
what happens, but I'll tell you what--I'm going to be ready. I've
been thinking about this situation every day since I've been traded.
I fall asleep thinking about it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a part of me that says I want to go there and save four
games against those guys. I love them to death, but I want to beat
them badly."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca relishes the chance to see one of his
best friends again. Batting against him is another story.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, I don't want to face him," Lo Duca said.
"I don't know what I'm going to do. Smile? Laugh?</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it won't come down to a tight situation. It's going to
be tough."</TE>
<TE>   Few things were as difficult for Herges to deal with as his trade
from the Dodgers. His 20 victories in relief the previous two seasons
ranked as the most in the majors and he was hoping to become the
team's closer.</TE>
<TE>   But Herges lost his chance when he gave up nine earned runs and 19
hits in nine innings during spring training.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Eric Gagne was showing the stuff that would land
him the closer role.</TE>
<TE>   On March 23, Dodger General Manager Dan Evans sent Herges and
double-A shortstop Jorge Nunez to the Expos for reliever Guillermo
Mota and outfield prospect Wilkin Ruan.</TE>
<TE>   The news left Herges in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone from heartbroken over being traded and crying at the
drop of a hat to now I want to beat these guys," Herges said.</TE>
<TE>   No one doubts the Dodgers for choosing Gagne as their closer. The
26-year-old right-hander entered Wednesday's game against the New
York Mets with 12 saves and a 1.29 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Herges has appeared in 21 games for the Expos and has a 3.68 ERA
in 22 innings. He has blown three saves, including Wednesday night
against the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way Herges could have duplicated what Eric Gagne has
done," Evans said. "It's nothing against Matt, but he doesn't have
the physical stuff that Eric has.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he has good friends here. We loved having him here, but we
had to do what's best for the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   While he is enjoying his opportunity with the Expos, Herges still
questions the trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I still do not know why I couldn't be part of that bullpen," he
said. "I didn't have to be the closer, that's not the issue. Eric
Gagne has some of the best stuff in baseball. I would love to be
setting him up."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Herges is settling in with the Expos, who entered
Wednesday night's game two games behind the Florida Marlins in the
National League East.</TE>
<TE>   Herges said playing before 4,000 at Olympic Stadium is different
than playing before crowds of 40,000 or more at Dodger Stadium, "but
when I come into a game, I can't tell if there is one person in the
stands or 100,000 because I'm focusing on getting major league
hitters out."</TE>
<TE>   Herges has stopped longing for a quick route out of Montreal. He
and his wife, Jane, are living in large loft in a historic building
in Old Montreal and they are expecting their first child.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got traded, my first thought was, 'How quick can I get out
of there?'" Herges said. "But the truth is, I like it here and like
the guys and what is going on.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be traded. The best-case scenario is for me to
stay here and someone buys the team and moves it to Washington, D.C.
That would be awesome. We could be America's team."</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Listless Play Remains a Big Concern</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the jeers of the home fans still echoing, Mexico's national
soccer team seeks refuge and recovery in San Francisco and Los
Angeles this week with two final tuneup games before embarking to the
World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Having been booed during a listless 2-1 victory over Colombia on
Sunday in Mexico City, Mexico will regroup at 8 tonight in an
exhibition against Bolivia at San Francisco Stadium at Candlestick
Point, followed by a match against Italian club AC Milan Sunday at 2
p.m. at the Coliseum. Monday, the team travels to Japan, where it
will play its first World Cup match June 3 against Croatia.</LD>
<LD>   Drawn into a demanding group that also includes Italy and Ecuador,
Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre is hoping to use the Bolivia and Milan
matches to prepare for the South American and Italian playing styles
his team will encounter in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Bolivia failed to qualify for the World Cup, finishing seventh in
the 10-team South American qualification group. Assigned to rebuild
the program, Bolivia Coach Carlos Trucco will be playing a squad
composed mostly of young prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre experimented with his lineup against Colombia, tinkering
at four positions, much to the consternation of the crowd at Estadio
Azteca. Playing with little passion or purpose, the Mexican players
were booed as they left the field at the end of a scoreless first
half.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre made four substitutions in the second half, bringing on
several attackers and defender Rafael Marquez. Mexico took the lead
in the 52nd minute on a goal by Jared Borgetti, but couldn't hold it
for long. Fifteen minutes from time, Marquez scored on a header to
salvage the victory, if not forgiveness from the home fans and media.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly unimpressed was Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have won," he said, "but I wish we had played better,
particularly in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is 3-2 in its last five warmup games, but with the
exception of a 4-0 victory over lightly regarded Albania, has
struggled to score goals. Since mid-February, Mexico has lost to
Yugoslavia, 2-1, and to the United States, 1-0--and needed a
90th-minute goal to beat Bulgaria, 1-0, on April 17.</TE>

<LD>As the next and expected step in labor negotiations that are going
nowhere, the Major League Players Assn. has begun considering
possible strike dates as a reluctant recourse if convinced that
baseball owners are determined to unilaterally implement new work
rules when the World Series ends.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not settled on any dates or proposed any to our executive
board," Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said Wednesday in
Los Angeles, preparing to brief area player agents on the labor talks
today.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope we don't have to do that," he continued, referring to the
setting of a strike date.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal is to reach a settlement, but in any labor negotiation,
you have to consider all of your alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   The setting of a strike date--or a strike itself--would not be a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscent of the 1994 labor upheaval, it has been viewed as an
oft-chronicled possibility amid management's determined try to
overhaul the economic system with bargaining proposals aimed at
restricting payroll growth and taking revenue from the New York
Yankees and other big spenders who drive the market.</TE>
<TE>   Although Commissioner Bud Selig has pledged not to lock out the
players during the season or postseason, he has offered no assurances
about the off-season, when owners, without negotiating movement,
could declare an impasse and implement their own work rules.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr refused comment, but a union official said, "We weren't
misled. We fully understood the message in Bud's pledge."</TE>
<TE>   At Dodger Stadium Wednesday night, Selig cited the "painful
memories" of 1994, said he was reluctant to get involved in the
"sideshows" and added, "The only way to resolve all this is at the
table ... [and] before everyone overreacts, you have to remember
there hasn't been a strike date set yet."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the owners' attempt to implement new rules amid
stalled negotiations in 1994, the players walked out after games Aug.
11, thinking their dramatic action might stimulate an agreement in
time to return for the playoffs and World Series. When there was
still no agreement on Sept. 14, Selig canceled the World Series for
the first time since 1904. The owners did ultimately implement new
work rules only to be found guilty of unfair labor practice in
federal court, ending the longest of baseball's eight work stoppages.</TE>
<TE>   Short of an agreement before this season ends--and both sides
agree there has been no progress on the key economic issues--the
union is again reluctant to enter the off-season without any
leverage, with unsigned players at the mercy of a new system that
would certainly include the two key management proposals now on the
table: a 50% tax on all payroll above $98 million and an increase in
revenue sharing from 20% of local income to 50% after park expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union will not accept a tax it considers tantamount
to a salary cap and an artificial drain on salaries, Fehr hinted
Wednesday he is bewildered by an absence of meaningful negotiations
and the refusal of owners to respond to union proposals on revenue
sharing and other issues. The result, he suggested, is general
confusion over where the owners are headed.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about igniting a public debate with Selig and the
owners, Fehr refused to discuss any of that in depth, but an aide
said there can be only four possible conclusions as to the owners'
possible direction:</TE>
<TE>   * They still operate under the mistaken belief that the union can
be broken and apparently believe another prolonged work stoppage,
initiated by the implementing of new work rules, won't damage the
game beyond repair.</TE>
<TE>   * They feel they can begin serious negotiations on the eve of a
strike, even though any trust will have been destroyed by then and
there will have been no groundwork laid.</TE>
<TE>   * They have no interest in serious talks until the arbitration
decision on contraction, which is not expected until mid-July or
later, killing several more weeks of potential bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   * They are frozen in place, with Selig uncertain of how to move
off his bargaining positions without a loss of face.</TE>
<TE>   None of that has merit, Selig and his negotiating team would say.
It is simply time to change the system and address the revenue and
competitive disparities. They would say--and have said--that they are
there to negotiate and it is the union that has failed to provide
meaningful responses.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric is familiar, the lessons forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   In response Wednesday to word that the union is now considering
strike dates, Robert DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer,
called it "a bit of a surprise and more of a disappointment given
that the owners did not choose to exert economic leverage on the
players" by declaring a lockout during the season. He said it was a
disappointment as well because the owners are only trying to address
competitive balance with a "noninflammatory deal" that avoids putting
an economic onus directly on the players through a salary cap or tax.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think we can work out a deal at the table," DuPuy said.
"I think we both have an understanding of what happened in 1994 when
the players struck, and we should be motivated to not let it happen
again."</TE>
<TE>   Backed into a corner in '94, the players are beginning to feel
cornered again.</TE>
<TE>   Their executive board, made up essentially of player
representatives from various clubs, probably will meet in Chicago on
the Monday before the July 9 All-Star game in Milwaukee to hear the
union's recommendation regarding a strike and the dates.</TE>
<TE>   It is also possible that the union, knowing that high-salaried
players will always take the brunt of fan criticism during a stoppage
no matter the circumstances, will ask several All-Stars to make a
public plea for industry peace during that period, explaining their
position on the key issues.</TE>
<TE>   If it comes to a strike, early August is again the probable
period, although the union could go out even earlier if convinced
that the Fox television contract continues to underwrite the owners
in the event of a stoppage. An earlier strike date would threaten the
owners with an increased loss at the gate and deprive the players of
a larger percentage of salary.</TE>
<TE>   Would this all be different if Selig had not pulled the
negotiating rug from under his then-chief operating officer--and
since resigned--Paul Beeston last summer or if so many valuable weeks
of the winter had not been wasted on contraction?</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't the loss of faith and hope in too many cities, as the
commissioner likes to darken the picture, really come down to suspect
management?</TE>
<TE>   Can baseball survive another stoppage?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunate questions without answers in mid-May of a season in
which the Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins, Florida Marlins and
Cincinnati Reds are among the clubs trying to prove there's more
balance than some people would have you believe.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Suitors Are Many</HD>
<DH>NFL: Chargers, Saints, Vikings, Colts, Bills and Cardinals
emerge as candidates to relocate to possible new stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a coalition of power brokers formally unveiled their plans
Wednesday for a football stadium in downtown Los Angeles, six NFL
teams emerged as the most obvious relocation candidates: San Diego,
New Orleans, Minnesota, Indianapolis, Buffalo and Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from the Philip Anschutz-backed stadium group said
they have begun tentative discussions with two of those
teams--identifying the Chargers as one--and added the NFL told them
the stadium should be capable of housing two teams. With that a
remote possibility, the Anschutz group is concentrating on laying the
groundwork for one team.</LD>
<LD>   While an NFL return to L.A. is far from a certainty, Anschutz
Entertainment Group President Tim Leiweke is predicting something of
a bidding war if the stadium inches closer to becoming a reality.</LD>
<TE>   "You're going to have a few teams that are going to be aggressive
with us," said Leiweke, who declined to identify the second team,
citing a confidentiality agreement signed by both sides. Sources say
the team is Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said Anschutz, a Denver billionaire, is not interested in
owning an NFL team, but is interested in the stadium endeavor if it
makes financial sense.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke also said the group has had introductory discussions with
USC and UCLA about the stadium becoming the permanent home to one or
both of those college football teams. UCLA, whose contract with the
Rose Bowl expires after this season, is the most likely team to make
the switch.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics have questioned whether a new stadium could secure enough
dates to make it financially feasible, even with an NFL and college
team. But Leiweke and coalition partner Casey Wasserman envision
hosting such other events as soccer, motor sports and concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Key to the whole process, Leiweke said, is a commitment from the
NFL that the stadium play host to as many as three Super Bowls in a
10- to 12-year span. He essentially said the deal would be derailed
absent such a promise.</TE>
<TE>   The two-team proposal was a rather surprising development.
Observers say the league wants to maintain Los Angeles as leverage,
even after a team moves there.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the chances of that happening are slim, there is a
precedent for that. The Meadowlands in New Jersey is home to the New
York Jets and Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke also pointed to the example at Anschutz-owned Staples
Center, shared by the Lakers and Clippers and the NHL's Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said a best-case scenario would have a team ready to play
in Los Angeles--at a temporary site, either the Coliseum or Rose
Bowl--by the 2003 season. If all things progress smoothly, he said, a
team could move into a new stadium by the 2005 season.</TE>
<TE>   Although Leiweke said the Raiders are not one of the stadium
candidates, the team is suing the city of Oakland, claiming its lease
was negotiated in bad faith. A trial is set for March and if the
Raiders win, they could be freed from that agreement. Another team
mentioned as a possibility has been the 49ers, whose plans for a new
stadium are in limbo. But a spokesman said Wednesday that he would
"bet a fortune" the team would never move from San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   A glance at the six teams whose leases allow them to leave within
the next few years:</TE>
<TE>   San Diego--The Chargers are already moving their training camp in
2003 from La Jolla to the Anschutz sports complex in Carson, and they
have a major loophole in their lease with publicly owned Qualcomm
Stadium. The contract, which extends through 2020, has a clause that
would allow team owner Alex Spanos to "shop" for a new city in 2004
if the team exceeds certain salary restrictions imposed by the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota--Viking owner Red McCombs is very interested in selling
his team, and, according to NFL sources, has already contacted the
Anschutz coalition about buying it. The problem with the Vikings,
though, is there is no clear way out of their Metrodome lease in the
next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans--Saint owner Tom Benson says he wants to keep the team
in New Orleans and last week signed a 10-year, $186-million deal with
the state to keep the franchise among the top 16 teams in local
revenue. But escape clauses remain in the lease, and it's unclear
whether New Orleans can continue to support an NFL team, let alone
the transplanted Charlotte Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo--It's highly unlikely the Bills will ever move out of
Buffalo as long as Ralph Wilson is the owner. After all, they play in
a stadium named after him. But sources familiar with the situation
say Wilson does not have enough cash to transfer the team to his two
daughters and pay the estate tax. After the 2004 season, the Bills
can get out of their Buffalo lease by paying a $20-million penalty.
That penalty shrinks each subsequent year, all the way down to $2
million in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis--Although their lease expires in 2005, the Colts can
get out of their lease earlier if they dip below the median in total
operating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona--The Cardinals have the money for a new stadium, including
more than $350 million from taxpayers, but they have yet to find a
suitable place to put it. They have zeroed in on a Mesa site, but
people there are circulating a petition to keep a stadium out of
their town.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Tippett, a King assistant for the last three seasons, will be
named coach of the Dallas Stars today, Tippett confirmed late
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great opportunity," Tippett said from New York, where he
spent the day negotiating a contract with Star owner Thomas Hicks and
General Manager Doug Armstrong. "Dallas has a tradition of being a
first-class franchise and I'm very thankful for the opportunity
they're giving me."</LD>
<LD>   Tippett, 40, takes over from another former King assistant, Rick
Wilson, who served as interim coach after Ken Hitchcock was fired
Jan. 25. The Stars, who won the Stanley Cup in 1999 and reached the
finals in 2000, had won five consecutive division titles before
missing the playoffs this year for the first time since 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Tippett, one of the NHL's most highly regarded assistant coaches,
oversaw the Kings' league-leading power play this season. He also
served as interim coach for five games in late February and early
March while Coach Andy Murray recuperated from injuries suffered in a
traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   He met with Armstrong on Saturday in Dallas, then interviewed
Monday in Palm Springs with Glen Sather, president and general
manager of the New York Rangers, about the Rangers' coaching vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars also reportedly were interested in having Hitchcock
return, but after Hitchcock was hired Tuesday by the Philadelphia
Flyers, the Stars moved quickly to secure Tippett.</TE>

<HD>Maddux Seems a Bit Familiar to Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux pitched into the ninth inning for the first time this
year. The San Francisco Giants thought nothing had changed.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the same old stuff," Rich Aurilia said after Maddux limited
them to an unearned run and five hits in eight-plus innings during
the Atlanta Braves' 6-1 victory Wednesday at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what he's going to do to you," Aurilia said. "He has
great movement and hits his spots. There's a reason he's won so many
games. He knows how to pitch and how to get people out."</LD>
<TE>   Maddux, who began the season on the disabled list with back
problems, was happy just to get eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been feeling better every time out and it feels good to
pitch past the sixth inning," he said. "Whatever feels right I just
go ahead and trust it and throw it. They kept hitting balls right at
people and didn't get any cheap hits. I'll take that."</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (4-2) walked two and struck out one. Thanks to a pair of
double plays, Maddux threw only 66 pitches through the first seven
innings. He retired 13 of 14 batters at one stretch, and improved to
23-12 against the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Pittsburgh 2--Steve Finley's sixth-inning homer struck
a woman in a wheelchair located behind a protective railing, one of
three Arizona home runs at Pittsburgh. Several fans rushed
immediately to assist the woman in the right-field stands before
paramedics arrived. She received several stitches in the head but
otherwise was not seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez and Junior Spivey also homered as Arizona took two
of three in the series and finally won a game not started by Curt
Schilling and Randy Johnson. They had started during each of the
Diamondbacks' last three victories.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Florida 2--Bobby Estalella hit two solo home runs and
pinch-hitter Terry Shumpert had a tiebreaking shot in the seventh
inning at Denver. Todd Helton added a two-run single and Brent Butler
a two-run double in the Rockies' five-run seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Jennings (4-2) won before 27,898, the smallest crowd in
Rockies' history, breaking the previous low of 28,651 set the night
before. About a mile away, the Colorado Avalanche was playing San
Jose in Game 7 of the NHL's Western Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, Milwaukee 4--Jimmy Haynes beat his former team and
Todd Walker tied his career high with four hits at Milwaukee as the
Reds defeated the Brewers for the sixth straight time. Haynes (3-4),
who was 7-18 for Milwaukee last season, gave up seven hits and two
earned runs in 61/3 innings. He also had a sacrifice, a single and a
run scored.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Chicago 1--Woody Williams emerged after nearly six
weeks on the disabled list and gave up an unearned run in six innings
at St. Louis. Pinch-hitter Miguel Cairo's RBI triple off right
fielder Sammy Sosa's glove drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh.
The Cubs lost their seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Philadelphia 2--Craig Biggio hit three doubles, leading
Carlos Hernandez and the Astros to a three-game sweep at Houston.
Hernandez (4-1) gave up four hits and two runs over seven strong
innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 2, Montreal 1--Ryan Klesko's drive off the right-field
wall scored D'Angelo Jimenez from second with one out in the 14th
inning at San Diego. The game lasted four hours 19 minutes</TE>

<HD>Contenders Look to Make a Break</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Baffert's War Emblem has a penchant for
grabbing lead, but rival trainers say their horses will be up to the
challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Space limitations in Forty Niner's old past-performance record from
the Daily Racing Form reduce the colt's trip in the 1988 Preakness to
two words: "Brushed rival."</LD>
<LD>   That's a rank understatement. What Forty Niner did to Winning
Colors, the Kentucky Derby winner, in that Preakness was an all-out
mugging. Had that happened on the street, the perpetrator would have
gotten hard time. The only penalty for the late Woody Stephens, who
trained Forty Niner, was a seventh-place defeat, the colt's worst in
a 19-race career.</LD>
<LD>   By one count, Forty Niner and his jockey, the choirboyish Pat Day
riding to Stephens' pre-race ultimatum, came out and bumped, brushed
and intimidated the filly and her rider, Gary Stevens, 12 times. A
gritty Winning Colors still finished third as Risen Star won, but
Stephens had his pyrrhic outcome. What he promised the day after the
Derby was accomplished: The filly didn't win the next one.</LD>
<TE>   The Triple Crown series of 14 years ago is relevant now because,
until War Emblem won the Derby in gate-to-wire fashion almost two
weeks ago, there hadn't been a front-end winner in the race since
Winning Colors beat Forty Niner by a neck at Churchill Downs. At
Pimlico on Saturday, in the 127th Preakness, the question is whether
the jockeys of other horses will go after War Emblem. Maybe not with
the ferocity of a Forty Niner against Winning Colors, but will a
rival or two step up and prevent War Emblem from cruising to another
victory?</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the early challenges that his horse never got in the
Derby, trainer Bob Baffert, who drew the lead picking position at
Wednesday's post-position draw, disdained the No. 6 and No. 7 posts
and chose No. 8 for War Emblem. As the rest of the draw unfolded,
three of the other speed horses--Table Limit, Booklet and Menacing
Dennis--drew spots outside War Emblem in the 13-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I took the 8 instead of something more inside was to
put those speed horses way on the outside," said Baffert, who has won
seven Triple Crown races--three Derbies, three Preaknesses and one
Belmont Stakes--out of the last 17.</TE>
<TE>   Having won here with Silver Charm and Real Quiet in 1997-98 and
with Point Given last year, Baffert could become the first
conditioner since 1900 to twice notch consecutive victories in
Pimlico's premier race.</TE>
<TE>   But in the opinion of Pimlico's Frank Carulli, making the
Preakness betting line for the first time, Medaglia d'Oro, not the
Derby winner, will go off the favorite. Medaglia d'Oro, the
fourth-place finisher in the Derby after a bumpy start cost him
position early, is listed as the 5-2 favorite, followed by War Emblem
at 3-1 and Harlan's Holiday at 9-2. While the weather forecast for
Saturday is iffy, the best guess is that expected rain will end by
noon, resulting in a fast track.</TE>
<TE>   "Medaglia d'Oro was the only Derby horse that had an excuse,"
Carulli said. Of the last six Derby winners, only one--Fusaichi
Pegasus, in 2000--went off favored in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   Much like the Carulli, rival trainers are not in awe of War
Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets his own way, as he did in the Illinois Derby and the
Kentucky Derby, War Emblem is very dangerous," said Ken McPeek, who
trains Harlan's Holiday, the 6-1 Derby favorite who ran seventh. "But
he's really a one-dimensional horse, and that makes him suspect when
he doesn't get an easy lead."</TE>
<TE>   John Ward Jr., who couldn't beat Harlan's Holiday in their last
two Derby preps and then didn't run his Booklet at Churchill Downs,
is expected to tell his jockey, Pat Day, to pressure Baffert's horse
from the break. Asked if War Emblem is good enough to sweep the
Triple Crown--a feat last achieved by Affirmed in 1978--Ward said:</TE>
<TE>   "Let's wait until Saturday to say whether War Emblem's a standout.
I don't even think that [Prince Ahmed Salman, War Emblem's owner] or
[Baffert] know right now whether they have a standout or not."</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes after the Derby, Jerry Bailey, who finished 12th
astride Castle Gandolfo, predicted that War Emblem would find the
going tougher at Pimlico. Bailey, having replaced Laffit Pincay Jr.
on Medaglia d'Oro since the Derby, is in a perfect position, from
post No. 5, to be the protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   Proud Citizen, second in the Derby but four lengths behind War
Emblem, is 6-1 on the morning line. His trainer, Wayne Lukas, who has
won the Preakness five times, is also running Table Limit, who is
30-1 in his first stakes start. At Santa Anita last winter, Table
Limit was a woeful loser, finishing more than 45 lengths behind the
winners of three races. Then at Keeneland in April, Table Limit won
twice by 12 lengths. He is running in this race as an afterthought,
with Gary Stevens riding him for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Bill Young [Table Limit's owner] that I don't know if his
horse will win, but he won't be embarrassed," Lukas said. "We were
originally pointing for the Belmont. The Derby is yesterday's news.
Proud Citizen might have won the Derby, but he needed a little help
from our friends [horses with speed]. Booklet's the key to this race.
It's up to him to run with War Emblem early."</TE>
<TE>   At Pimlico's stakes barn Wednesday, not long after his Preakness
pair had been flown to Baltimore from Louisville, Lukas didn't have
to be reminded of the bitter Winning Colors-Forty Niner donnybrook.
As the trainer of Winning Colors, he had a front-row seat.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless Woody Stephens," Lukas said, "but if he hadn't worried
about my filly and stayed with his own strategy, he might have won
the Preakness. Our two horses ding-donged it all the way around."</TE>
<TE>   Lukas said that he will not stray from his Derby strategy for
Proud Citizen on Saturday. In other words, jockey Mike Smith will be
told to sit off the pace, as he did at Churchill Downs, and hope that
this time that other speed will get War Emblem lathered up. For that
assignment, there appears to be more volunteers than there were on
May 4.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyler Clark didn't make any predictions following his impressive
performance Wednesday at the City Section swimming preliminaries at
USC.</LD>
<LD>   Clark, a senior at Granada Hills High, posted the top qualifying
times in the 200-yard individual medley and 100 butterfly, and has a
good chance to become only the second boy since 1993 to break a
section record, but he remained mum about those possibilities.</LD>
<LD>   "I've just always been superstitious," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Clark has good reason to be cautious. As a sophomore, he narrowly
won the 200 individual medley after the goggles worn by favorite
Brian Brown of Woodland Hills El Camino Real slipped down his face
during the race. Clark was able to overtake Brown at the end, just
missing the City Section record of 1:55.22 set by Jeff Kline of
Granada Hills Kennedy in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was looking forward to breaking the record last spring, but
his season ended the week before preliminaries when he broke a foot
playing basketball. Without him, Granada Hills still ended Venice's
streak of six consecutive City titles.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who swims for Canyons Aquatics, returned to the
preliminaries Wednesday and looked sharp. He won his heat in the 200
individual medley in 1:58.64, nearly 13 seconds faster than the next
qualifier. Clark said he hopes to break 1:54 in the finals Wednesday
at USC, which would be enough to surpass Kline's record.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who will swim for Rutgers next fall, is competing in the
butterfly for the first time at the section championships. He
produced the top mark of 52.18, within striking distance of the meet
record of 50.77, set by El Camino Real's Tom Liliekis in 1984. Clark
also helped the Highlanders earn top qualifying honors in the 400
freestyle relay (3:32.53).</TE>
<TE>   Clark's performances, along with a disqualification by Palisades
in the 200 medley relay for leaving the blocks too early, should keep
the boys' team race close.</TE>
<TE>   Palisades emerged as the girls' team to beat for the second
consecutive season. The Dolphins broke a record in the 200 freestyle
relay. Shira Frankel, Caitlin Owens, Laura Johnson and Cara Davidoff
combined to swim 1:41.50, breaking the mark of 1:42.01 set by Granada
Hills in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   In softball:</TE>
<TE>   Downey Warren 1, Long Beach Wilson 0--Morgan Sanchez (10-5)
pitched a two-hitter and Nicole Sheldon's run-scoring single in the
third inning provided the difference for Warren (16-7) in a Southern
Section Division I wild-card game at Wilson (15-11).</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Hoover 4, Oxnard Hueneme 1-- Daisy Barcena hit a grand
slam with two out in the top of the eighth inning to give the
Tornadoes (14-13) a wild-card victory against the visiting Vikings in
the Division I playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Schnitger (12-12) pitched a three-hitter, striking out five,
walking three and allowing one unearned run. Schnitger started the
two-out rally in the eighth with a walk, followed by Kathleen
Martinez's infield single. After Xiomara Ferretti walked to load the
bases, Barcena hit a deep fly ball over the right fielder's head for
the game-winning grand slam. Hueneme scored in the bottom of the
eighth on an error.</TE>
<TE>   San Jacinto 1, Covina 0--Alyssa Winslow (17-6) struck out 18 in a
three-hit shutout as the Tigers (18-6) won a wild-card game against
Covina (10-12) in the Division IV playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Alisa Schlosser scored on a two-out single by Nicole Van Eklenburg
in the bottom of the fifth inning. Winslow, a sophomore, has 240
strikeouts in 149 innings this season.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills El Camino Real 6, Van Nuys Birmingham 5--Jeremy
Boyle drove in the deciding run and Daniel Lee and Christian Harriot
each had two-run home runs to lead El Camino Real (25-4, 12-1) to a
victory in its West Valley League finale.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham (23-5, 9-4) finished in second place after Chatsworth
(23-5, 8-5) lost, 4-3, to Cleveland. Jeremy Boyle broke a 5-5 tie
with a run-scoring single.</TE>

<PH>NBA PLAYOFFS WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS Game 1: Lakers at
Sacramento, Saturday, 3:30 p.m., Ch. 4</PH>

<HD>Style Points</HD>
<DH>In This Movement, It Would Be Better for the NBA if Kings
Won It All</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>This is not meant as an insult to the Lakers, who have been fine
two-year NBA champions and the dominating force of professional
basketball.</LD>
<LD>   This is no impugning of the talents of the NBA's two best players.
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal have singular talents. We have never
before and may never again see a man as large as Shaq be able to move
with such speed and nimbleness and strength. We have never before and
may never again see a man of Kobe's young age with such single-minded
focus and maturity and accomplishments.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it would be a great thing for the NBA if the Sacramento
Kings were able to beat the Lakers in the NBA Western Conference
finals and also whatever middling team comes from the East.</LD>
<TE>   It is no accident that the Kings-Dallas semifinal series was
watched by audiences more than 30% larger than have watched any of
the other playoff series so far.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball played by Sacramento and--not quite as well--by the
Mavericks, is aesthetically appealing. It is a game of movement and
skill, of great passing and jump shooting, of strength, certainly,
but also of finesse.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento has a group of players who see the floor well and seem
to see all the possibilities the game can offer. They see all the
possibilities because so many are available to this team. "We can do
so many things," Sacramento guard Doug Christie says. "We have a lot
of guys who are versatile."</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings play offense, all five men are involved. Any of
five players can pass and score. Big men such as Vlade Divac, Chris
Webber and Peja Stojakovic can dunk and shoot from outside. The Kings
play fast, yet they play patiently. They do things by instinct, but
it is instinct produced by visualizing their next move and the one
after that. They sometimes seem like the chess master who never,
never concedes he has been stopped.</TE>
<TE>   When there are five, four, three seconds left on the shot clock
and the defense is about to congratulate itself on a great
possession, Mike Bibby or Webber or Christie will make a soft bounce
pass to a sneaky cutter who has been forgotten by a defender who was
already thinking about the next play. The Kings never give up on
finding ways to score because they have so many ways to score.</TE>
<TE>   It is a tribute to Shaq and Kobe, the way the Lakers play, and by
necessity the way Laker opponents play.</TE>
<TE>   Because Shaq is of a size and strength unmatched by anybody, a
game involving the Lakers is brutally physical. Shaq is beat upon by
defenders who have no other options and Shaq beats back because he
can't help it and it works so well. A man who is 7 feet 1 and weighs
around 340 pounds doesn't nudge or tap. He slams and mashes. Because
Kobe is capable of improvisational greatness at any time, his
less-talented teammates by nature and design will clear out the floor
and watch him go. And suddenly a game invented to be choreographed
movement in space, with all sorts of problem-solving challenges and
opportunities, becomes static, body-crunching, 24-second snippets of
plodding interrupted by a second or two of impossible heroics.</TE>
<TE>   It might be effective, but it is dull.</TE>
<TE>   Laker fans are living dangerously if they refuse to take the Kings
seriously or if they refuse to appreciate that the Kings do some
things better than the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Does it sound silly to say that a team that plays its games in a
glorified barn set in a glorified pasture serenaded by fans whose
fame comes from ringing cowbells would help the NBA immensely by
winning?</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, the city, falls somewhere behind Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, maybe even Oakland, even in its own
state.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, the basketball franchise, has won one NBA title, in
1951, five years before an African American would play for the team,
four years before the 24-second clock was introduced. That team was
the Rochester Royals then and they beat the Minneapolis Lakers in the
Western Division finals and the New York Knicks in the Finals. Each
Royal earned a $7,500 championship reward.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the franchise went to conference finals, in 1981,
the team was known as the Kansas City Kings. For many years, when the
team was in Cincinnati and had Oscar Robertson as its star, the
Royals could not get past the Celtics in games with scores of
135-132.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, it's hard to accept that Sacramento is in the
class of the Lakers. It's hard in Los Angeles to take seriously the
little team from up north, a team of so little accomplishment
historically speaking, a team counting 51 years since its last title,
against the two-time defending champions.</TE>
<TE>   But as this L.A.-Sacramento series unfolds, don't be so uppity,
L.A. fans, that you don't admit the way the Kings play basketball is
fun and liberating and the way basketball should be played.</TE>
<TE>   Which is not to say the Kings are better than the Lakers. They are
different. They are new and maybe a bit old too. They are confident
and they believe in the possibilities. The possibilities of the first
pass and the second and the fifth. The possibilities of the pump fake
and the pick and roll, of cutting and weaving, of shooting the jump
shot and making it. The possibilities of sound defense and relentless
offense.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Elimination games never seem to worry the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Roy is the reason.</LD>
<LD>   Roy stopped 27 shots to make Peter Forsberg's goal in the second
period stand as the defending Stanley Cup champions beat the San Jose
Sharks, 1-0, Wednesday night in Game 7 of the Western Conference
semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   Roy extended his league record with his 22nd career playoff
shutout and tied a record with his 11th Game 7 appearance. He is 6-5
in Game 7s, but has allowed a total of two goals to win the last
four--three of which have been in the Avalanche's last three series.</TE>
<TE>   "I said before Game 6, if there is one player I'm not worried
about for Game 7 it's Patrick," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said.
"He's our energy, he's the reason that every game we feel that we
have a chance to win. He came up large tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado reached the conference finals for the sixth time in seven
years. The Avalanche will face the Detroit Red Wings in a matchup of
the West's top two teams during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 is Saturday in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose won a division title for the first time this season but
lost two consecutive games in failing to reach its first conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks scored one goal in the final two games to blow a 3-2
series lead for the second time in franchise history. San Jose also
lost the final two games of the 1994 conference semifinals to
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "This team deserves better than this. We had a great season,"
forward Teemu Selanne said. "I hope when we get a chance like this
again, we remember how this loss felt."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose had a two-man advantage for the final 55 seconds after
pulling goalie Evgeni Nabokov and a tripping penalty was called on
Colorado's Rob Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Roy blocked a hard shot from the right circle by Mike Rathje, then
stopped Selanne from the left side with nine seconds left. Joe Sakic
won a faceoff in Colorado's zone with four seconds left to seal it.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg scored with 2:10 left in the second on a give-and-go with
Alex Tanguay.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg flipped a no-look pass to Tanguay just after crossing
into the Sharks' zone, and Tanguay quickly sent it back to him
between the circles. Forsberg seemed to lose the puck just before he
reached the crease, but flipped in a shot under Nabokov's blocker.</TE>
<TE>   It was Forsberg's sixth goal of the series.</TE>

<LD>I'm sitting in the Palm Restaurant eating chilled jumbo shrimp and
ordering anything I want off the menu, compliments of the Anschutz
Empire. So let me tell you, as far as I'm concerned, things are
really looking up now that the Anschutz Empire is trying to bring the
NFL back to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   I remember when I had to listen to Los Angeles City Councilman
Mark Ridley-Thomas drone on and on without the benefit of even potato
chips or pretzels.</LD>
<LD>   When Michael Ovitz was still somebody, and he had a stadium
proposal, he had martinis sent to my hotel room. I wish I could tell
you more, but I can't remember.</LD>
<TE>   Now we have Tim Leiweke giving The Times lunch and a sneak preview
of today's news conference, and after listening to his stadium spiel,
I found it hard to quibble with anything he said--because I've always
been taught not to talk with food in my mouth.</TE>
<TE>   LEIWEKE SAID this will be L.A.'s best and last shot at getting an
NFL team, and I'm all for that, although history suggests he has no
idea what he's talking about.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote a story for Page 1 of The Times on May 16, 1997 that had
Leiweke's boss, Philip Anschutz, pledging $500 million along with
partner Ed Roski to bring pro football back to the Coliseum in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this isn't going to be easy," Anschutz told me in the
last interview he has given to The Times, "but we're committed to
trying."</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing that wasn't L.A.'s "best and last shot at
getting a NFL team," because a little more than a year later Anschutz
let it be known through a spokesman he was no longer committed to
trying to bring a team here.</TE>
<TE>   I FIND it difficult to get excited about these stadium
announcements. I went to a news conference at Hollywood Park on Dec.
8, 1995, and R.D. Hubbard had a beautiful stadium model. He stunned
everyone with the pronouncement a relocated team would be in L.A. in
1996 and moving into a new stadium at Hollywood Park in 1998. Never
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Peter O'Malley's toy model was made of building blocks, but he had
me standing on a hill outside Dodger Stadium overlooking the city's
skyline envisioning a new football stadium. I'm just glad he didn't
ask me to envision Shawn Green batting .300.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Arco President Lowdrick Cook and consultant Shel Ausman
tried to get the city interested in a new stadium in South Park--in
the same area Leiweke is now touting as the end-all to L.A.'s
football woes. I didn't think Leiweke would have an original idea.</TE>
<TE>   Roski and Anschutz were taking deposits for luxury suites in the
"new'' Coliseum in 1997, and those people who sent in checks have to
feel pretty silly today. Then came Ovitz, calling his stadium "The
Hacienda," which was going to be built in Carson until Ovitz changed
his mind and got behind the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in there Councilman Nate Holden was sounding the alert,
"The Raiders are coming, the Raiders are coming," and that's when I
learned it's a waste of time to listen to anything Holden has to say.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cruise, Jerry West, Kevin Costner, Magic Johnson and Shaquille
O'Neal were identified as minority NFL owners for L.A.'s new team,
and West got so upset he moved to Memphis. Charlton Heston spoke on
behalf of the Coliseum and Mayor Richard Riordan put together,
"Football L.A.," a committee assembled to bring the NFL back--that
met once.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Broad popped up as a potential owner next, or maybe it was
Marvin Davis; I get all those billionaires mixed up. Grocery store
rich guy Ron Burkle teamed with Ovitz, but when the NFL asked for
money, he disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue stood in front of the Coliseum and
said this is where football belongs; this week he said, scratch that.</TE>
<TE>   From what I can tell, the only ones who have made out in this
process are the guys who build the little stadium models. I believe
we're at 10 or 11 at last count.</TE>
<TE>   By the looks of the one the Anschutz Empire has put together, they
took some sixth grader's school project and told the kid that even
though his teacher failed him for his poor work, they could still use
it.</TE>
<TE>   LEIWEKE HAS one considerable advantage over Broad, Ovitz and the
cast of thousands who were left groveling at the NFL's doorstep the
last eight years. Instead of pursuing an expansion franchise and
having 31 owners divide an expansion fee, he needs to convince only
one owner to accept a deal in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Today Leiweke will tell the media there are six teams available.
The Anschutz Empire, however, is focusing on one, the San Diego
Chargers. Leiweke and partner Casey Wasserman, who worked recently as
a business advisor to the Chargers, are convinced the city of San
Diego will let the team leave after this season to avoid buying
unsold tickets to watch a lame-duck team in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If they are correct, and Leiweke can come to terms with the Spanos
Goofs, who have run that team into the ground, we'll have the
Chargers--and USC will no longer be the worst football team in town.</TE>
<TE>   I have a feeling, however, the NFL is going to be playing games
with Leiweke &amp; Co. for a while, which means Leiweke's patience is
going to be tested.</TE>
<TE>   Because he's known for having none, we're probably going to have
some dramatic moments in the coming months when it appears he will
take no more and quit, as his boss did five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I hope when that happens he calls and we can get together at the
Palm over dinner and discuss it before he does anything rash.</TE>

<HD>Zidane's Goal Is the Difference</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 31 nations with pretensions of taking the World Cup away from
France next month were shown Wednesday just how difficult that task
will be.</LD>
<LD>   Zinedine Zidane, the midfielder whose two goals against Brazil in
the France '98 World Cup final were key to a 3-0 victory in Paris
that earned the French their first world championship, scored another
glorious goal Wednesday to propel Real Madrid of Spain to its ninth
European Champions Cup triumph.</LD>
<LD>   The goal, almost on the stroke of halftime, proved decisive as the
Spanish team held on to defeat Bayer Leverkusen of Germany, 2-1, in
front of 51,456 in Hampden Park at Glasgow, Scotland.</LD>
<TE>   Zidane had been on the losing end in the finals of 1997 and 1998
while with Juventus of Italy, but he proved that his move to Madrid
last year for nearly $65 million was money well spent.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 1-1, after Raul scored an opportunistic goal
for Real Madrid in the ninth minute, one-timing a throw-in from
Roberto Carlos past goalkeeper Hans Jorg Butt, and Lucio returned the
favor six minutes later by heading the ball past Sanchez Cesar.</TE>
<TE>   A tie at halftime seemed certain, but Zidane then produced a flash
of magic. Taking a high cross from Roberto Carlos, he swung his left
leg in a scything motion and crashed a spectacular 18-yard volley
into the roof of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nice goal to score," he said. "I simply slammed the ball
in without thinking. It was purely instinctive."</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid had lost the Spanish league championship to Valencia
and the King's Cup to Deportivo la Coruna, but could not be denied
Wednesday. Bayer Leverkusen threw everyone forward in the last few
minutes, including goalkeeper Butt, but could not score the tying
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who went into the game in the 68th
minute after Cesar was injured, made three or four tremendous saves
in close succession to preserve Real's victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a special victory for the people of Madrid," Real Coach
Vicente del Bosque said. "I am pleased for them that we could bring
them a trophy after missing out in other competitions, especially in
our centenary year."</TE>
<TE>   Raul, Spain's World Cup striker, said Real Madrid's third European
Cup triumph in the last five years proved a point.</TE>
<TE>   "We've proved that the club is the best in Europe," he said, "the
best ever. We're going to celebrate this all night and all of
tomorrow as well."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's defeat was particularly difficult for Bayer
Leverkusen, which had three trophies within its grasp this season
only to see them slip away.</TE>
<TE>   The club led the Bundesliga for most of the season, but lost two
of its last three games to much weaker teams and was beaten to the
title by Borussia Dortmund on the last day of the season. It also
reached the German Cup final, but lost to Schalke '04 by a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Klaus Topmoeller said he expected the team to break up in
the wake of the triple disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we managed to present a challenge to Real and we got
quite close to them, but at the end of the day you don't always get
the rewards for all the sweat and commitment you put in," he said.
"However, we should honor the performance and forget about the
result."</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2002</TE>
<TE>   Injuries that have been playing havoc with World Cup-bound teams
knocked three more players out of the May 31-June 30 tournament when
Costa Rica, Sweden and Ireland each lost a player Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   For Costa Rica defender Reynaldo Parks, the blow was particularly
cruel. The team was already training in Japan when he re-injured a
knee. Coach Alexandre Guimaraes summoned defender Pablo Chinchilla
from Costa Rican league champion Deportivo Alajuelense as Parks'
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden lost midfielder Hakan Mild, who played on the team that
finished third in the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Mild
ruptured an Achilles' tendon while training at Stockholm. "I'm going
to go home, rest and watch the World Cup on television," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Mark Kennedy withdrew from Ireland's squad--which plays
Nigeria at Dublin today--after re-injuring a groin and was replaced
by Steve Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil has yet to play its first game, but Ricardo Texeira,
president of the Brazilian soccer federation, said he wants Coach
Luiz Felipe Scolari to remain as coach, with former coach and World
Cup player Paulo Roberto Falcao as an assistant.</TE>

<HD>Hingis Faces Foot Surgery</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Procedure would sideline the former No. 1-ranked
player for French Open and beyond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former No. 1-ranked tennis player Martina Hingis is expected to
require surgery on her injured left foot, representatives from her
management firm, Octagon, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The surgery would put her out of the upcoming French Open in
Paris, ending a streak of 29 consecutive Grand Slam events since she
turned pro in late 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Various media reports, fueled by one of her doctors in a radio
interview, placed Hingis' career in jeopardy, but that speculation
was said to be premature because medical examinations were ongoing in
Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   Because of that, the timetable regarding Hingis' future, let alone
a return to the tour, is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "Surgery is anticipated," Octagon President Phil de Picciotto
said. "It depends on the diagnosis, what the problem is and what they
do to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, 21, has had a chronic foot condition, forcing her to miss
several events. She played in back-to-back tournaments in Southern
California last summer and then pulled out of the Canadian Open.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Hingis withdrew from the German Open in Berlin and
Italian Open in Rome after re-injuring her foot at an event in
Hamburg, Germany, this month.</TE>
<TE>   Her physical problems became an issue when she filed a $40-million
lawsuit against Italian manufacturer Sergio Tacchini last year in
separate actions in Milan and New York. Legal action is ongoing.
Hingis asserted that the shoes from the company were "defective" and
"unsuitable for competition," causing the injuries. The Italian
company countered by saying then that an earlier case found no basis
for her claims.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, who won five Grand Slam tournaments before turning 18, has
not won a Grand Slam event since the 1999 Australian Open. Since
then, she has been in the final of four majors, most recently the
Australian Open in January, losing to Jennifer Capriati after holding
four match points.</TE>
<TE>   She held the No. 1 ranking for 209 weeks, relinquishing it in
October when she injured her right ankle against Lindsay Davenport.
Hingis dropped to No. 7 on Monday when the latest WTA rankings were
released, the first time she has been out of the top five since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   De Picciotto said that the season-ending WTA Championships, which
will be held at Staples Center in November, had secured its first
major corporate partner, Porsche, which will be the presenting
sponsor. The company, the title sponsor of a popular women's indoor
event at Filderstadt, Germany in October, also agreed to be the
sponsor of the "Race to the Championships."</TE>

<HD>Now, Bryant Is Christie's Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland's Ruben Patterson attempted to thwart Kobe Bryant in the
opening round and failed. San Antonio's Bruce Bowen tried to stop
Bryant in the conference semifinals and failed.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's Doug Christie's turn.</LD>
<LD>   Christie was sensational in the Kings' five-game victory over the
Dallas Mavericks in their conference semifinal. So said Dallas Coach
Don Nelson in the wake of his team's early playoff exit.</LD>
<TE>   "Those guys were sensational," Nelson told the Sacramento Bee when
asked about the Kings. "You could give the MVP on the Kings to any
one of six players. My favorite was Doug Christie. He was such a
sensational player in this series and my hat is off to him.... I just
loved the way he competed in every game. I really like their whole
team. They brought it to us and they should really be proud of their
team."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas guard Nick Van Exel played with Christie with the Lakers in
the early 1990s. Van Exel believes Christie, 32, is a different
player than he was as a young man just off the Pepperdine campus.</TE>
<TE>   "He was out of control when he played with the Lakers," Van Exel
said. "He tried to do too much. Now he's older and he's calmer. He's
smarter, more relaxed and he's a great defender. With age, you get a
lot wiser. You can't just rely on talent all the time. Doug has
become a great player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings went back to work Wednesday, a day after what felt like
a citywide holiday in celebration of the team's first appearance in a
conference final.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just for us or for [Coach Rick Adelman]," center Vlade
Divac said. "It's about the organization, it's about the fans, it's
about the city. They are so into the life of the team. They really
deserve this."</TE>
<TE>   Added Lawrence Funderburke, the only remaining player from the
Kings' 1997-98 team that won only 27 games:</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a lot of frustration let out. Sacramento, the
city, has always been sort of seen as a doormat franchise for so
long. I know my first year, there was no hope of ever winning. We had
to wait our time and I know the fans were patient as well for us to
get to this point."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings lost three of four to the Lakers during the regular
season, splitting two games at Arco Arena and dropping two games at
Staples Center. Chris Webber played in only one of the four games, a
97-96 King loss at Arco.</TE>
<TE>   Dating to 1984, when the Kings were playing in Kansas City, the
Lakers have won all three playoff series against them. The Lakers
swept them in three games in the opening round in 1984 and defeated
them, 3-2, in the opening round in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lakers swept the Kings in four games in last season's
conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have outshot their opponents from the field in seven of
their nine playoff games and won them all.... Joe and Gavin Maloof,
co-owners of the Kings, are scheduled to appear tonight on "The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno."</TE>

<HD>FIRST LOOK: KINGS VS. LAKERS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward: Chris Webber, the Kings' most valuable player, averaged 23.2
points and 10.8 rebounds in the team's nine playoff games, after he
averaged 19.8 points and 11.5 rebounds in five previous postseasons.
He shot 38.8% in eight games last season, including 42% against the
Lakers. The subject alone makes him touchy. Asked about his previous
playoff performances on Tuesday night, he spat, "I don't even respect
that question." Though Webber sprained his ankle in Monday's Game 5
victory against the Dallas Mavericks, it's another difficult matchup
for Robert Horry and Samaki Walker, who already have dealt with
Rasheed Wallace and Tim Duncan. Peja Stojakovic, who is expected to
be out at least the next two games because of a sprained ankle, shot
37.7% while being defended by Rick Fox during last year's playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Center: Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard pound Shaquille O'Neal as
best they can, draw him out of the middle on offense, flop around a
little on defense, and hope they can hold on long enough for the rest
of the Kings to do their thing. For the size of the mismatch, O'Neal
did not destroy the Kings in the regular season, when he averaged
25.3 points and 11.8 rebounds in four games. Last postseason was
different. In that sweep, O'Neal scored 33.3 points and took 17.5
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Guard: Mike Bibby, who replaced the reckless Jason Williams in an
off-season trade, outplayed Steve Nash in the final two games of
their series. In his first postseason, Bibby has averaged 18.3
points, 5.4 assists and 3.9 rebounds. He also has made nearly half of
his three-point attempts. The Kings defend Kobe Bryant with Doug
Christie, who is rangy and game enough to occasionally pester the
Laker swingman. Still, Bryant shot 50% and scored 25.5 points a game
against the Kings this season, and averaged 35 points in last year's
Western Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching: Phil Jackson has had to work a little harder this year,
primarily because of injuries to O'Neal and the improvement from the
rest of the Western Conference. But he has run his playoff record to
148-51 by keeping O'Neal edgy and allowing Bryant room to play
outside the triangle. Rick Adelman got a lot of votes for coach of
the year because of the Kings' strong regular season. He coached the
Portland Trail Blazers into the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992, losing
to the Detroit Pistons and then to Jackson's Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis: The Kings earned home-court advantage because of their
NBA-best 61-21 record. Against the Lakers, however, they lost three
of four games, the losses by an average of more than seven points.
Unfamiliar arenas don't frighten the Lakers, who have won a record 11
consecutive road playoff games. They beat the Kings, 97-96, at Arco
Arena on March 24, and won two regular-season games and two playoff
games there last year, when they swept the Kings in the conference
semifinals. Sacramento is 4-0 on the road in this postseason against
Utah and Dallas. This is the Kings' first trip to the conference
finals since 1981, when they played in Kansas City and lost to the
Houston Rockets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most players talk about getting a split when they open a playoff
series with two games on the road. Not the Lakers. They're thinking
two.</LD>
<LD>   "I think if we go up there early enough and handle our business
and if we win two games up there, this team has been known to fold,"
Samaki Walker said of the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "I watched them on TV last year, and I basically watched them give
up after getting down 0-2.</LD>
<TE>   "But I think if we send a message, going up there and winning two
games, I think that we'll definitely have the series in our favor."</TE>
<TE>   Here's some more Walker, who hasn't taken long to catch onto the
Laker attitude in his first year with the club.</TE>
<TE>   "They deserve the attention they are getting right now," he said
of the Kings. "They are cherishing every moment, which is good.
Because, come Saturday, they have to play against the two-time
defending world champions, and I think that's saying a lot in itself.</TE>
<TE>   "When you haven't beaten a team, regardless of how good a season
you have, or whether you finish first or second, this is a team,
Sacramento, that hasn't found a way to [beat the Lakers]
consistently. So there's going to be some doubts in their heads about
whether they can beat this team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox will probably inspire the Kings and their fans with his
statement that "We're going to win the next round," but what else was
he supposed to say?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've, at this time of year, consistently found ways to
win games," Fox said. "I truly believe we're the better team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lacking the home-court advantage, but I think that's going
to be a challenge that excites us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers expect their scoring, currently 92.5 points a game in
the playoffs, will increase against the Kings. It will probably have
to, if they expect to win against a squad that averaged 102.2 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we'll be playing a team that plays with a different
tempo, I think there will be more possessions, there will be more
opportunities to get some baskets in transition," Derek Fisher said.
"Obviously, we can't score 85 points in this series."</TE>
<TE>   J.A. Adande</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson probably is the opposing coach who's most
despised by the boisterous Arco Arena crowd, and he'll be back on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Before the first of Sacramento's three consecutive playoff
meetings with the Lakers, Jackson famously called Sacramento a
"cowtown" and "semi-civilized."</TE>
<TE>   King fans responded by ringing cowbells behind the Lakers' bench,
and the practice has become an Arco tradition for any visitor.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson's record against the Kings since taking over the
Lakers probably bothers King fans more than his verbal shots. Jackson
is 16-5 against Sacramento since 1999, and the Lakers have won seven
of their last eight games against Sacramento, starting with a
four-game sweep in the second round of last year's playoffs.</TE>

<LD>Finding the winner's circle has not been a problem for any of the
seven entrants in tonight's third race at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Ranging in age from 4-7, the six geldings and one mare have
combined to win 36 races in 159 starts and four of the seven enter
the 350-yard starter allowance dash off victories.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Go On Green, the likely favorite, has won his last three
and five of his last six for trainer Paul Jones. A gelded son of
Blushing Bug, the 5-year-old has won seven of 21 lifetime and again
will be ridden by Ramon Sanchez.</LD>
<TE>   Kacy Red, a 4-year-old mare owned by Margarito Farias and trained
by Jorge Farias, will break from the outside. She has won two in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   The others who won their last start are Chicks Wicked Six and
Dedicated Diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Kims Dash. 2. Ultimate Prize. 3. Go Green Go. 4.
Gabriels Thunder. 5. That Giver. 6. Tam's Rebelette. 7. Ryans Ridge.
8. Enjoy The Moment.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the fifth, let's use Girling, Apollotician, That Giver,
Fine Wines and Adashofred, single Tam's Rebelette in the sixth, use
Ryans Ridge and Ihempentobefast in the seventh and Heated, Naughty
Corona and Enjoy The Moment in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Especially Red Hot makes his first start since
Oct. 21 for Gilberto Hernandez in the first and Joe Badilla Jr. takes
the call. Pac Man Express is eligible to improve second time after a
layoff in the third for trainer Dan Luna.</TE>

<HD>Nets Break New Ground</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They end Hornets' stay in Charlotte and
reach conference finals for first time, 103-95.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just like the team they defeated, the New Jersey Nets are headed to
new territory--their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 26
NBA seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kidd had 23 points and 13 assists and made several plays in
the fourth quarter that swung the momentum New Jersey's way as the
Nets defeated the Hornets, 103-95, Wednesday at East Rutherford,
N.J., ending the Hornets' 14-year existence in Charlotte, N.C. The
team moves to New Orleans next season.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey held Charlotte to one field goal in the final 7:37. In
winning this best-of-seven series, 4-1, the Nets gained each of their
victories with tenacious fourth-quarter defense. This foul-marred
game was no different.</LD>
<TE>   The game changed in the Nets' favor after Baron Davis fouled out
with 5:36 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, who stunned the NBA by posting the best record in the
conference (56-26) only a season after going 26-56, will play the
Boston Celtics in the conference final starting Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we knew we were going to be this good at this
point," Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   With the officials calling 22 fouls in the final quarter and 77 in
the game, the Hornets managed to stay alive in the fourth quarter as
Lee Nailon and Jamaal Magliore alternated trips to the foul line.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many nights when something like this felt like it
was on the other side of the mountain. I'm going to enjoy this for a
long, long time," Net guard Lucious Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and David Wesley had 13 points apiece for Charlotte, which
played the entire series without Jamal Mashburn (vertigo).</TE>
<TE>   Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire was booked and
released from jail early Wednesday on a felony charge of marijuana
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire posted the required 10% of his $50,000 bail and went
home about 2 a.m. Stoudamire pleaded innocent Tuesday to the charge
of possession of a controlled substance, and a trial date of Oct. 1
was set by Circuit Judge John Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire's attorney plans to challenge the legality of the
search of Stoudamire's home by police responding to a burglar alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Former Memphis Grizzly general manager Billy Knight, 49, was hired
by the Atlanta Hawks for the new job of director of basketball
operations.... Ray Clay, the Chicago Bulls' longtime public-address
announcer, will be replaced next season by Steve Scott, a local radio
fixture. A Chicago Sun-Times report contends Clay's dismissal was
prompted by his confiding to one of the newspaper's columnists a
desire to give former Bull Michael Jordan a rousing introduction when
he returned to the United Center as a Washington Wizard.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Costas said Wednesday he has decided to stay at NBC--at a greatly
reduced workload--and the network today will announce an agreement on
a new four-year contract reportedly worth more than $1 million a
year.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the deal, Costas will continue as the host of the 2004
Summer Olympics and 2006 Winter Games. He will also be available for
a variety of other roles, such as serving as the host of NBC specials
or filling in on such shows as "Today."</LD>
<LD>   "It was a combination of loyalty and that NBC still has the
Olympics as a centerpiece," Costas said of the decision to remain
with his longtime employer.</LD>
<TE>   Costas earlier signed a three-year deal with HBO, reportedly worth
about $2 million a year. It calls for him to not only continue doing
his "On the Record" show but also serve as host of "Inside the NFL"
and be involved in the pay-cable network's boxing coverage and other
projects.</TE>
<TE>   "My increased responsibility at HBO made this a nice fit," Costas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Costas had considered an offer to work in sports and news at ABC,
but his HBO workload apparently made the NBC offer more attractive.</TE>

<TE>   San Francisco's 3Com Park, home of the NFL's 49ers, has been
renamed San Francisco Stadium at Candlestick Point, the team said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Recreation and Park Department, which owns the stadium,
decided on the name after being unable to find a sponsor to replace
Santa Clara-based 3Com, the fourth-biggest computer-networking
company. The company's contract, which was signed in 1995 and has
twice been renewed, expired Jan. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old stadium was called Candlestick Park before the

<HD>Stojakovic Out at Least Two</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Kings' All-Star has a badly sprained ankle,
which should put Turkoglu in the starting lineup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peja Stojakovic will be sidelined for at least the first two games of
the Western Conference final series against the Lakers, the
Sacramento Kings said Wednesday. Game 1 is Saturday afternoon at Arco
Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Stojakovic sprained his right ankle May 9 in Game 3 of the Kings'
conference semifinal series against the Dallas Mavericks. He did not
play in Games 4 or 5 and is unable to run or simply shoot baskets
while his teammates practice.</LD>
<LD>   How long Stojakovic, a first-time All-Star who was averaging 18.3
points and 6.9 rebounds in the playoffs, will be sidelined is
uncertain.</LD>
<TE>   If he cannot play, Hedo Turkoglu with start in his place. It also
will deprive fans of one of many intriguing matchups in this series:
Stojakovic versus Laker forward Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I think he's a long way from playing," Sacramento
Coach Rick Adelman said after Wednesday's practice. "He definitely
won't play in Sacramento, and I just have to assume we're not going
to have him.... All we can do is wait and see how quickly it [his
ankle] responds."</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic, a 6-foot-9 swingman, was not immediately available for
comment. Adelman told reporters than Stojakovic is not using crutches
to get around. But he added that Stojakovic continues to receive
twice-daily treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson filled in for Stojakovic in Game 4, but Adelman went
with Turkoglu in Game 5 and Turkoglu scored 20 points and took 13
rebounds. The Kings won the game and took the series, four games to
one, over the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Six Sacramento players scored at least 15 points in Game 5 against
the Mavericks, and Turkoglu ended a prolonged shooting slump with a
big game in his first playoff start.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to help the team, but Peja is the star," Turkoglu
said. "I just have to do my best until he's ready to come back."</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Stojakovic averaged a career-best 21.2
points and 5.3 rebounds. With Fox hounding him, Stojakovic averaged
18 points in four games against the Lakers, however.</TE>
<TE>   Without Stojakovic in their last two games, the Kings continued to
score with their customary effectiveness. Forward Chris Webber has
been saying this season that the Kings' offensive diversity has been
their strength this season.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Sacramento scored 102 points or better in each of its five
playoff games against the fastbreaking Mavericks, a team that's
unlike the more patient Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't Stojakovic's first extended absence this season. He
also sat out nine games and played one minute in another late in the
regular season because of a strained right hamstring. The Kings won
eight of those 10 games, however.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Takes Relaxed Approach</HD>
<DH>Soccer: World Cup team gives impression that all is well
despite having a few problems to solve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARREN, N.J.</DL>
<LD>To judge by its public appearance schedule, all would seem to be well
with the United States World Cup soccer team, which plays Jamaica
tonight at East Rutherford, N.J., in its next-to-last warmup game
before leaving for South Korea next week.</LD>
<LD>   Take Wednesday, for instance, when the team spent nearly as much
time in New York as in New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Strikers Clint Mathis and Brian McBride joked around with Al Roker
on NBC's "Today" show. They and the rest of the team also had time
for a private tour of Ground Zero, scene of September's terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The day before, about a half-dozen players went to St. Benedict's
Prep at Newark, N.J., to visit former World Cup midfielder Tab Ramos,
who was announcing his retirement. Later in the day, McBride, Cobi
Jones and Landon Donovan filmed public service announcements for
UNICEF.</TE>
<TE>   That might be well and good, but the team's opening World Cup
game, against Portugal, is only three weeks away, and the team has
more than a few problems to solve.</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing one is to find a replacement for injured
defensive midfielder Chris Armas. Pablo Mastroeni is a
more-than-adequate stand-in, but Coach Bruce Arena also wants to take
a look at Claudio Reyna, John O'Brien and Tony Sanneh in that role.</TE>
<TE>   If none seem suitable, he might call in a replacement, but Arena
has said he will not decide until after Sunday's match against the
Netherlands at Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is defender Carlos Llamosa, who must prove to Arena
that he either is fit enough already or soon will be fit enough to
remain on the squad of 23. The FIFA-mandated roster deadline is
Tuesday, and Llamosa has been battling to get back in top shape after
a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former Galaxy defender Greg Vanney waits in the wings.
Vanney, now playing for Bastia in France, is the only one of 10
stand-by players who is training with the World Cup team, which has
led to speculation that he might take Armas' roster place, although
not his position.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders Reyna, O'Brien and Eddie Lewis, and goalkeeper Kasey
Keller have returned from Europe and probably will get some playing
time against Jamaica. Arena said Wednesday that he expected to use 16
to 18 players tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Jamaica was on the other side of the ball when the U.S. clinched
its fourth consecutive World Cup berth Oct. 7 at Foxboro and would
like nothing more than to prove that it also belongs in Korea/Japan
'02.</TE>

<HD>Depth May Beat Lakers' Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KRIEDLER</AU>
<BD>SACRAMENTO BEE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming up next on the NBA triple feature: Your neck, whipsawing over
to a third vision entirely.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Lakers, they ain't like those other guys.</LD>
<LD>   The great thing about the challenge of Los Angeles is that the
Lakers are the greatest-hits collection of the lesser playoff teams.
That isn't merely what made them two-time NBA champions; it's what
defines them as a franchise.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Utah Jazz, the Lakers rely heavily on two players and a
supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Utah, the Lakers' two players are Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant, and the supporting cast includes people such as Robert Horry,
Derek Fisher and Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Dallas Mavericks, the Lakers aren't afraid to get out and
run with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Dallas, the words "out of control" almost never appear in
the article about that part of the game in the next morning's paper.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are the better half of most everybody. Nobody stops
Shaq; very few people stop Kobe. The L.A. situation is unparalleled
in the NBA: A team whose two best players are arguably the first two
most people would pluck out of the talent pool.</TE>
<TE>   And yet this is the year the Sacramento Kings may have enough to
counter--not counter Bryant and O'Neal specifically, but counter L.A.
in whole, fighting position-control with balance and depth. O'Neal is
banged up; Peja Stojakovic is barely walking. But if this becomes a
war of attrition, the Kings suddenly jump up on the odds board.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't going to be about the Kings' momentum in the Western
Conference finals, and that's actually the blessing. Momentum comes
and goes.</TE>
<TE>   It's totally unreliable, is the thing. The Lakers long ago
dismissed momentum as a useful concept, opting instead for consistent
effort. They let their opponents worry about who had the big Mo. If
they won a game ugly, they simply accepted the result and went
forward.</TE>
<TE>   This was the season when the Kings appeared to embrace the same
idea. Oh, they had their winning streaks and their long rolls, but
look closer: This is a team that went 15-5 to open the season without
the injured Chris Webber. It's a team that went 6-0 on a crucial
late-season road trip--virtually ensuring themselves of the
home-court advantage they have in this L.A. series--primarily without
the injured Stojakovic.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic went down in Game 3 against Dallas, and that was a win,
and so were the next two games that wrapped up the second round for
Sacramento. There was nothing about any of it that suggested the
Kings were winning on momentum; they were winning on desire and depth
and talent and heart.</TE>
<TE>   They went from halting walk to dead sprint when they went from
Utah to Dallas and won both ways; and now they're going in to play a
scene with a Lakers' team that knows quite a bit about any style
you'd care to throw down. There's no momentum here on the cusp of the
conference finals. What it's really about, thank heavens, is
basketball.</TE>

Statistical Twist
Key per-game statistics for Sacramento's Peja Stojakovic against the
Lakers and the rest of the league for the last two seasons (playoff
games included). Stojakovic, the Kings' second-leading scorer in the
2001-02 regular season, probably will be sidelined at least two games
against the Lakers in the Western Conference finals because of an
ankle injury</TE>

<LD>Johnson obituary--Ward G. Johnson's obituary in Wednesday's
California section was actually an accounting of the life of his
father, George R. Johnson. Ward Johnson is very much alive and the
information in the obituary otherwise accurately reflects the life
and career of his father, a Long Beach civic leader who died Saturday
at his home in Rolling Hills.</LD>

paper that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management opposed the sale of
1,640 acres of public land in Wyoming to the Mormon Church. The BLM
has not stated a position on a bill that would allow the sale. The
Interior Department, which oversees the bureau, backs the bill.</LD>
