<HD>'Once and Again' Pulled Over Kiss</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The ABC station serving Roanoke-Lynchburg, Va., pulled Monday's
episode of "Once and Again," apparently concerned about a story that
included a romantic kiss between two teen girls.</LD>
<LD>   The station--WSET, which promotes itself as "the heart of
Virginia"--broadcast an infomercial in "Once and Again's" place. A
station representative confirmed the episode did not run but declined
to comment about the reason.</LD>
<LD>   The action drew criticism from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation, which says there was nothing inappropriate about
the show and is calling on the station to air the episode within 30
days.</LD>
<TE>   Stations periodically decline to run network programs, either to
make room for local fare or because they believe the content may
offend viewers. Roanoke-Lynchburg is the U.S.' 67th largest TV market
and reaches about 420,000 homes, less than 0.5% of the audience.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If American rock has recently resembled a failed anger management
class at a pro wrestling match, something quite the opposite has been
developing under the general radar, and it's ready to emerge.</LD>
<LD>   With a banner reading "Fight the Good Fight" behind him at the
House of Blues on Monday, Dashboard Confessional--the stage name of
young Florida singer-songwriter Christopher Ender Carrabba--presided
over what was in effect a group sharing session.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the only thing that rivaled the deeply felt emoting of
his high, boyish voice as it rose to a tear-soaked wail was the
audience singing as one from the very first note. Often as not,
Carrabba simply stood back and let the fans carry the vocals.</LD>
<TE>   Call it wimpy, call it whiny, but don't doubt the bond the slight,
unimposing singer has forged with fans in need of this kind of
communal purging. While the music, sometimes solo and sometimes
backed by three band members, generally resembled an acoustic
Blink-182 minus the sophomoric humor, the environment was closer to
an Ani DiFranco show.</TE>
<TE>   As for the "good fight," he's not exactly Bono. In most of his
songs it seems to come down to girl trouble (this guy has some
serious abandonment issues), but there was evidence of growing
emotional range in a couple of new songs. And when he used electric
guitars, he seemed prepared for moves to larger facilities. Carrabba
headlined a bill (scheduled for two nights at the House of Blues)
marked by earnest striving for emotional equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas quintet the Anniversary, Carrabba's labelmates on L.A.'s
Vagrant Records, spiritedly presented its brand of alt-prog, complete
with shifting tempos, unconventional time signatures, shag haircuts
and bell-bottom pants. They leaned more toward the Smashing Pumpkins
than Yes, but without either's pomposity.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts singer-songwriter Ben Kweller, a caffeinated mop-top
in front of a three-piece band, played a winning set of witty ditties
shifting somewhere between Ben Folds and Weezer.</TE>

<HD>Court TV: New Filmmakers</HD>
<DH>Television* Tonight's 'Guilt by Association,' starring
Mercedes Ruehl, is the cable channel's first attempt at movie
production, an exploration of mandatory minimum sentencing laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Court TV Chairman Henry Schleiff admits "the last thing the
world generally needs is another television movie," that hasn't
stopped the cable channel from diving into the movie business with
its first production, "Guilt by Association," which premieres
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Schleiff hopes that Court TV's movies--the network plans to
produce two to four a year--won't be typical legal fodder. "We wanted
to do movies that were important," he said, "as opposed to just
another movie about a lawyer or client in jeopardy."</LD>
<LD>   "Guilt by Association" focuses on the issue of mandatory minimum
sentence laws. Established in 1986, these laws were meant to combat
the drug epidemic and keep drug dealers and traffickers off the
streets.</LD>
<TE>   Critics, though, believe that the laws more often than not dole
out the most severe punishment to people who have little involvement
in drug trafficking and dealing. Since their inception,
women--especially those brought into the business by husbands,
boyfriends and sons--have been hardest hit with mandatory minimum
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes Ruehl plays Susan--a law-abiding lower-middle class widow
with two young children. She adores her new boyfriend (Alex Carter)
and even turns a blind eye to his pot smoking, telling him not to
light up in front of her kids.</TE>
<TE>   After realizing that her boyfriend and several of his cronies are
dealing drugs, however, she breaks off their relationship. When her
boyfriend and friends are arrested, Susan is convicted as part of
their conspiracy and sent to prison. Once incarcerated, Susan begins
her fight to win her freedom and clear her name.</TE>
<TE>   Ruehl, an Oscar winner for 1991's "The Fisher King," first learned
of the mandatory minimum sentence controversy on a TV news report
about a year before she received the script for "Guilt by
Association."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a news story about a woman who was either dating or
married to a guy who was dealing drugs," the actress said. "She had
absolutely no idea of the magnitude because he was also a lawyer and
a businessman. Suddenly, they all get arrested--this whole conspiracy
thing is slapped on them."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those arrested have their sentences commuted down if they
name names. But as with Ruehl's character in the movie, women
frequently have no names to give the government. So these women
generally receive full sentences.</TE>
<TE>   As for the women serving mandatory minimum sentences, Ruehl said,
"Not all of them are squeaky-clean innocents. Probably very few of
them are totally innocent. But I would say probably a vast percentage
of them don't deserve the time they are serving.... I don't think
anybody that I know who saw a boyfriend smoking pot at a party would
get on the phone and call in the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Anne Carlucci ("The Burning Bed") became more
incensed about the law when she read the stories of various women who
were given mandatory minimum sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "What came to me is that they are not jailing the Carmela Sopranos
of the world," she said, referring to the wife of a Mafia boss on the
HBO series "The Sopranos." "What is the difference? Their husbands
are part of organized crime. These women know a lot more than the
character Mercedes plays knew. It is just a grossly unjust law."</TE>
<TE>   When these women are sentenced, Carlucci said, "the whole family
goes to prison as much as the mother. They suffer. It's so sad. It's
really sad. Here [in the movie], the family is torn apart. If Susan
didn't have a sister, her children would be in foster care, and who
knows what their lives would be like."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Americans, Carlucci added, still believe that the
innocent "will be found innocent if you simply tell the truth. It's
absolutely not true. You need to get a lawyer. You need to get a
tough lawyer. You need to spend a fortune to save your life."</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "Guilt by Association" also sought a degree of
authenticity by shooting the film at a men's prison in Toronto. "It
has been my experience of making movies and working with actors, the
closer you get to the real thing the more it impacts," Carlucci said.
"Actors are like sponges. The environment is very important."</TE>
<TE>   Ruehl agreed, saying that making the film was an education for her
"because we worked in the prison for so long. It was a profoundly
depressing place. It kind of redefined the term 'helplessness' to me.
I don't believe we have to go any place for hell or purgatory. It's
right here."</TE>
<TE>   "Guilt by Association" can be seen tonight at 9 on Court TV. The
network has rated the movie TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children
under 14).</TE>

<HD>A Reality Check for Lovesick Fans</HD>

<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People fall in love, a little bit anyway, with a favorite television
show. You get to know characters who are usually more attractive (and
less demanding) than the supporting players in your own personal
drama and grow accustomed to their faces, which conveniently beam
into the living room each week.</LD>
<LD>   The late NBC programming guru Brandon Tartikoff once said that
every series on TV should be someone's favorite, and with so many
narrowly focused channels available, that's increasingly the case--so
much so that certain viewers appear intent on finding a conspiracy,
or someone to blame, when their program slips away. Thanks to the
Internet, moreover, such people can find like-minded folks to
convince them that they have lots of company.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, campaigns spring up every year as people form small
but cohesive groups dedicated to "saving" one TV show or another
teetering on the brink of cancellation. In some instances, the
camaraderie among these fans becomes an end in itself, with the
coalitions continuing to fraternize long after the shows have
departed.</LD>
<TE>   The latest object of such online affection is "Once and Again,"
ABC's romantic drama about two dreamily beautiful divorced people
(Sela Ward and Billy Campbell) who find love again, as well as the
sundry kids and exes that crisscross their lives.</TE>
<TE>   ABC brought the show back this month for a last-gasp run on Monday
nights, but after three years of mediocre ratings the network's
passion is gone. After lackluster ratings two weeks ago, viewing of
the show unexpectedly spiked upward on Monday, suggesting the series
may yet have some life in it; still, unless that trend holds, "Once
and Again" could easily be over and out when ABC announces next
season's lineup in May.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is being taken lightly by die-hard fans, who seem to
believe that everyone--ABC, rating service Nielsen Media Research,
men flying black Army helicopters--is out to kill their show.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, many well-meaning, articulate and sincere people have
written in urging me to help save the program, seeking media support
to bolster their letter-writing and plate-passing to buy ads in
Variety. These people should know that Walt Disney Co. Chairman
Michael Eisner does not take orders from me about how to run ABC,
though based on the network's recent track record--including its
failed attempt to bring David Letterman over from CBS, leaving the
studio scraping egg off its mouse ears--perhaps he should.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the correspondence, however, have also been messages from
people who simply won't accept that "Once and Again" is one of the
least-watched prime-time series on a ratings-starved network, with an
estimated average audience of 6.3 million viewers a week.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, 6 million of anything sounds pretty good, from album
sales to ticket buyers for a movie's opening weekend. Yet the sad
reality of prime-time television is that that many people watching
ABC, CBS or NBC will generally earn a show an unwanted vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that perspective is lost on a minority of the show's
supporters, who, given their own ardor, find it impossible to accept
that "Once and Again" isn't attracting "ER"-sized crowds. One wrote
in citing "the 6 million-plus [viewers] and the millions more who are
not counted" watching the series. Another asked why "ABC and the
Nielsen people" insist on taking her program away: "It has a huge
following, and many of us are protesting! We cannot understand why a
show of this caliber is being overlooked in the ratings!! Are ABC and
the Nielsen people listening to the public at all?"</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, I don't share quite that level of exclamatory
enthusiasm for the show, having exhausted my TV-viewing grief on an
earlier drama from "Once and Again" producers Edward Zwick and
Marshall Herskovitz, "My So-Called Life," which ABC snuffed out after
19 episodes in 1994. I was nearly as fond of their next show,
"Relativity," which also lasted a single season on ABC. (One might
assume the network or producers would learn from this history, which
did include the more enduring "thirtysomething," but then again, this
is television.)</TE>
<TE>   That said, it's understandable that a loyal core audience would
embrace the current series, which is classy, smart and earnest. What
I can't fathom is the venom directed at those who may cancel the
show, or the need to concoct elaborate plots explaining why a
low-rated series is heading to the big TV graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget that "Once and Again" has already received multiple
stabs at capturing an audience, in part because the show is produced
by Disney, which owns the network. Indeed, the show even played a
part in demonstrating the network's diminished reverence toward its
news stars, as ABC drew the public wrath of Barbara Walters by
bumping "20/20" off its Friday perch last fall to provide the drama a
better chance to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   As for Nielsen, its methodology may well be flawed, but the
ratings service has no interest in which programs survive so long as
the networks' checks clear, and everyone in television lives by the
tyranny of its data--including TV executives themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Network bureaucrats can be guilty of various sins, including
cynical programming choices, reluctance to take creative risks and
favoring programs that come from parent companies, sometimes at the
expense of quality. Yet they also live a frenzied existence in which
their next decision could render them ex-network executives, giving
them scant incentive to blithely discard programs after spending
millions to produce and promote them.</TE>
<TE>   Far from wanting to scuttle shows people love, then, they
desperately need to find such properties to maintain their car
allowances and Hawaii-Aspen lifestyles, enduring their own kind of
pain (albeit of the corporate variety) when they don't.</TE>
<TE>   What does this mean for those love-struck folks frantically
sending outraged e-mails? Only that if a favorite show disappears, a
share of the responsibility falls on friends and neighbors bypassing
it for schlock on competing channels. Because rest assured, if
another 6 million people tune in each week, you'll get "Once and
Again"--and plenty more smart, classy shows--not just once, but again
and again and again.</TE>

<HD>Edgy New View of Ireland Goes to Town</HD>
<DH>Urban, sexy films from an economically vibrant country,
once typified by rural images, are among those in an American
Cinematheque series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rod Stoneman vividly recalls a conversation he had three years ago
with a French movie critic after a screening of the Irish film "I
Went Down." "As we were leaving the screening at the Cannes Film
Festival, the critic said to me, 'I really loved it, but it's not an
Irish film,'" remembers Stoneman, who heads the Irish Film Board.</LD>
<LD>   "A lightbulb went off for me at that moment about people's
preconceptions of what an Irish film is. 'I Went Down' was Irish in
every way you could define it: It had an Irish writer and director,
it was made in Ireland with mostly Irish money. But the perception is
that Irish films are rural films with the cottage where the smoke
gently curls out from the thatched roof." There is nothing at all
quaintly rustic about "I Went Down," a dark, comic road movie about
two small-time crooks.</LD>
<LD>   Some movies, a la 1998's sweetly engaging "Waking Ned Devine,"
continue to play up the charming aspects of country life in Ireland.
But Stoneman says the new Irish cinema of the past 10 years is not
only stylistically diverse, but also often vibrantly edgy, urban and
sexy.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, Friday through Sunday and next Wednesday night, local
moviegoers will be able to sample some of Ireland's new wave of films
when the American Cinematheque and the Irish Film Board present a
collection of Irish movies at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The
New Irish Cinema series will screen a potpourri of documentaries,
dramas, animated and short films made in Ireland over the past
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman says Ireland's rapid economic growth in the mid- to late
'90s and its transformation into a more secular, liberal society have
helped open the door for more innovative filmmaking and storytelling.
Once-taboo subjects like homosexuality are now being portrayed in
unflinching fashion in some Irish films. The series kicks off tonight
with a program of various animated and live-action short films.
Highlights include "Give Up Yer Aul Sins" and "Fifty Percent Grey."
Both were recently nominated for Academy Awards in the animated short
film category.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman says Cathal Gaffney's "Give Up Yer Aul Sins" tells the
story of John the Baptist from the perspective of a little girl.
"It's very rude, fast and funny but in an innocent, childlike way,"
he explains. Ruairi Robinson's "Fifty Percent Grey" is a computer
animation piece Stoneman describes as "a little conceptual black
joke."</TE>
<TE>   Two rock 'n' roll documentaries will be offered Friday evening.
Sarah Share's "If I Should Fall From Grace" tells the often troubled
life story of Shane MacGowan, leader of the late, great Celtic rock
band the Pogues. Tom Collins' "Teenage Kicks" documents the history
of the influential late-'70s, early-'80s punk-pop band the Undertones
and its economically depressed Northern Ireland roots.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Murphy's "Nora" is the first of three films that will screen
on Saturday beginning at 5 p.m. Starring Ewan McGregor and Susan
Lynch, the drama is a graphically sexual portrait of writer James
Joyce's volatile relationship with his wife Nora. The film has played
previously in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Following "Nora" is "How Harry Became a Tree," a comedy-drama
about a tyrannical man who harbors an obsessive hatred toward the
richest man in an Irish village. The film was actually made by a
Serbian director, Goran Paskaljevic, which is perhaps fitting
considering Ireland's increasingly multiethnic makeup in recent
years. The surge of immigrants into suddenly prosperous Ireland has
helped to transform the country, even as it has sparked resentment
among some natives.</TE>
<TE>   "There are parallels between the Serb-Croat conflict and the
conflict in Northern Ireland, which is one reason Goran was attracted
to Ireland," observes actor Cillian Murphy, a cast member. "The film
is kind of allegorically about the pointlessness of hatred." Saturday
night's final movie tackles the Catholic-Protestant dispute head on.
The somber "H3" is based on real events in 1981 when a group of IRA
prisoners in Belfast launched a hunger strike. The film was written
by Laurence McKeown, who took part in the hunger strike. While he's
happy that Northern Ireland is currently in a calmer, more
conciliatory political phase, Stoneman admits that the civil discord
in this region and the issue of Irish independence from Great Britain
have spawned some powerful films. These conflicts have been the topic
of a number of high-profile films in the past, such as Jim Sheridan's
1993 drama "In the Name of the Father" and Neil Jordan's 1996 film
"Michael Collins." "Bloody Sunday," a movie about the tragic 1972
demonstration in Northern Ireland that resulted in the killing of 13
unarmed civilians by the British army, was pulled from the festival
after Paramount Classics decided to distribute the film theatrically
in the United States this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The series continues Sunday at 5 p.m. with "Traveller," a
documentary about the gypsy travelers in Ireland. It will be paired
with "Disco Pigs," a coming-of-age film by Kirsten Sheridan. She is
the daughter of Jim Sheridan, who along with directors Pat O'Connor
and Neil Jordan helped bring Irish-made films to prominent
international light in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Disco Pigs" finds the relationship between two close friends
changing as they grow further into teen-hood. After experiencing a
sexual awakening, the boy Pig (Cillian Murphy) attempts to bring a
romantic dimension to his relationship with Runt (Elaine Cassidy).</TE>
<TE>   "'Disco Pigs' is a very modern film," Murphy says. "It could be
set anywhere." Among those attending the festival will be Tom
Collins, actor Colm Meaney ("How Harry Became a Tree"), Sarah Share
and Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   The New Irish Cinema series takes place tonight, Friday through
Sunday and resumes Wednesday night at the Egyptian Theatre, 6712
Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 466-FILM or

<HD>Shakespeare's 'Labour's' Lost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Romance lends a dreamy sophistication to the early Shakespeare comedy
"Love's Labour's Lost," while earthy humor lets out a good, loud
belch every now and again. Sacred meets profane, and the characters
teach, by example, how to keep the two in balance.</LD>
<LD>   The play is a bit of a slog, though. Its comic and linguistic
conventions are firmly rooted in their day, and the people and the
notions being skewered are little-remembered.</LD>
<LD>   Aware of these challenges, the classical repertory company A Noise
Within and director Michael Winters have devised a production that
brings the text's universal qualities to the fore, while finding
recognizable equivalents for the rest. Yet even these smart ideas,
executed by some of the company's best actors, can't make the play
manageable. The audience gets too little return on its considerable
investment of brain cells.</LD>
<TE>   Scholars think that Shakespeare meant this play as a dig at Sir
Walter Raleigh's scientific discussion groups and as a rejoinder to
George Chapman's poem "Shadow of Night," which extolled a life of
contemplation and study.</TE>
<TE>   The story is set in Navarre, where the king (Stephen Rockwell) has
turned his court into a scholarly academy and tries to keep minds
focused on learning by enjoining his closest companions--Berowne
(Louis Lotorto), Longaville (Guilford Adams) and Dumaine (Ron
Morehouse)--to forswear female company for three years. Almost
immediately, the enchanting princess of France (Jill Hill) arrives on
diplomatic business with three smart, beautiful attendants--Rosaline
(Ann Marie Lee), Maria (Erika Ackerman) and Katharine (Kelly Anne
Ford)--in tow. With them around, monastic scholarship doesn't stand a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Today's theatergoers tend to be jarred by the play's quickly
disproved premise, and they're baffled by its elaborate wordplay,
which makes fun of the court's language as well as the clumsier
efforts of the oddball Spaniard Armado (Robertson Dean), the pedantic
Holofernes (William Mesnik), the fawning Sir Nathaniel (James Otis)
and the dim-bulb Costard (Richard Soto).</TE>
<TE>   To help the audience along, Winters turns the story into a fairy
tale that unfolds in a color-saturated, storybook kingdom (evoked by
Michael C. Smith's set and James Taylor's lighting). The characters
wear modern clothing (designed by Alex Jaeger), which helps connect
this fantasy world to our own.</TE>
<TE>   Gucci purses, Vogue magazines, Tiffany gift boxes and other
familiar landmarks are strewn throughout the action, and the king
hides a naked Cupid statue under a veil, much like the recent
covering of statues at the Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp acting further amplifies the humor, especially whenever Dean
is onstage to deliver his Salvador Dali-esque take on Armado,
complete with the painter's famous long, upturned mustache and
pinched, wide-eyed expressions.</TE>
<TE>   Good work, to little avail. There's a reason this play is rarely
performed today.</TE>
<TE>   "Love's Labour's Lost," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd.,
Glendale. The play returns to the repertory after the opening of "Bus
Stop": March 24, 2 and 7 p.m.; March 29, 8 p.m.; March 30, 2 and 8
p.m.; April 14, 2 and 7 p.m.; April 17-18, 8 p.m.; April 28, 2 and 8
p.m.; May 1 and 10, 8 p.m.; May 11, 2 and 8 p.m. Ends May 11.
$28-$32. (818) 240-0910. Running time: 2 hours, 50 minutes.</TE>

<LD>THEATER</LD>
<LD>   Charity Solicitations</LD>
<LD>   Upset Patti LuPone</LD>
<TE>   Patti LuPone was expected to return Tuesday night to "Noises Off!"
after a furor erupted following a Saturday matinee at the Brooks
Atkinson Theatre in New York City that caused the star to miss the
Saturday evening and Sunday matinee performances of the comedy hit.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at her home in Connecticut on Monday, LuPone explained
that what set off a screaming match between her and David O'Brien,
the production stage manager, was the manner in which a fund-raising
drive for Broadway Care/Equity Fights was handled. In the semiannual
event, the casts of Broadway and off-Broadway shows deliver a speech
at the curtain call and head into the audience with buckets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think charity is a private thing and to ask people for money at
the theater, after they've paid a $1 theater-restoration fee [and] a
$5 ticket surcharge on top of the price of the ticket, is just too
much," said LuPone, who has given numerous charity concerts in the
past. "Some of the company felt the same way and some did not. But I
did not want us to appear divided, so we agreed that three people
[from the cast] would remain onstage to make the petition."</TE>
<TE>   Faith Prince, one of the three selected, was unexpectedly joined
by co-star Peter Gallagher, while LuPone walked into the wings. When
she saw Gallagher onstage, LuPone exploded because, in her mind,
Gallagher's presence made her absence more noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gallagher was unavailable for comment, the producers issued
a statement: "Apologies have been made and accepted, and this issue
has happily reached a resolution."</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Sony Agrees to Pay for Promotional Missteps</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. has agreed to pay the state of
Connecticut $325,000 for using fake reviews attributed to a
Connecticut newspaper in promoting its films.</TE>
<TE>   The studio also agreed to stop fabricating movie reviews and to
stop using ads in which Sony employees pose as moviegoers praising
films they have just seen, Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal said
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The state launched an investigation last June after a reporter for
Newsweek challenged the authenticity of movie blurbs in Sony print
ads. The reviews, said to be from film critic "David Manning" of the
Ridgefield Press, praised films including "A Knight's Tale" and "The
Animal."</TE>
<TE>   Sony, Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Artisan
Entertainment later admitted using employees or actors in TV
commercials purporting to feature testimonials from moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   Sony says that such tactics were limited and have since been
eliminated. "While we're pleased to have this matter resolved, Sony
Pictures Entertainment acted voluntarily to tighten its advertising
policy last June shortly after management learned of the David
Manning incident," Sony spokeswoman Susan Tick told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Do Long Hours Make</TE>
<TE>   for Dangerous Drivers?</TE>
<TE>   Three crew members from the movie "Pleasantville" have called for
a government investigation into the risks of sleep deprivation in the
film industry, where 16- to 20-hour workdays aren't uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, John Lindley, Bruce McCleery
and James Shelton were moved to petition the Occupational Safety &amp;
Health Administration by the 1997 death of fellow crew member Brent
Hershman, who died in a car crash after a 19-hour day on
"Pleasantville." Exhaustion, they maintained, can trigger the same
behind-the-wheel impairments as alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "In a country which has declared war on drunk drivers, why are we
still allowing drivers to be overworked?" they asked.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Francis Sues, Seeks Control of Recordings</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal has been sued for $10 million by singer Connie
Francis, who accused the world's second-biggest media company of
allowing five of her songs to be used in films she described as
"vile" and "pornographic."</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, filed in Manhattan's U.S. District Court, she asks
for control over some 700 recordings and an order blocking Vivendi
from using her music, along with money damages.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, a top-selling pop singer in the late '50s and '60s whose
hits included "Who's Sorry Now?" "Lipstick on Your Collar" and "Where
the Boys Are," also accuses Vivendi and companies it has acquired of
pocketing royalties owed her, unauthorized release of her music on
compilation albums and taking advantage of her psychiatric woes in a
"one-sided" recording contract. The complaint recounts Francis'
battle with mental illness, her addiction to drugs and her 1974 rape.</TE>
<TE>   The company declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie have adopted a Cambodian
baby boy. Jolie, 26, took custody of the child on Sunday in Africa,
where she's working on a film, the child's grandfather, Jon Voight,
announced Monday at a lunch for Oscar nominees.... Francis Ford
Coppola is in Thailand reworking the country's box-office hit
"Suriyothai" for international release. He'll get a "Francis Ford
Coppola Presents" before the title and executive producer credit on
the film, which is due to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival in
May.</TE>

<HD>Cantors Show Off Jewish Gifts to Music</HD>
<DH>Benefit*  'Three Jewish Tenors,' under Carl St.Clair, will
include Broadway and patriotic songs in Costa Mesa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The expressive singing required of cantors in synagogues is not so
different from the demands of the lyric stage. So no one should be
surprised that, playing off the famous "Three Tenors" series of
concerts, a trio of cantors will be singing a "Three Jewish Tenors"
program Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   The soloists are Alberto Mizrahi, cantor at Anshe Emeth Synagogue
in Chicago; David Katz, cantor at Congregation Avodah in Long Beach,
N.Y.; and David Propis, cantor at Congregation Beth Yeshurun in
Houston. They will be accompanied by Carl St.Clair who will conduct
the Pacific Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   Propis thought up the concert, modeling it on one his father, Dov,
put together. A cantor and opera singer, the elder Propis brought
together tenors Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker, Peerce's
brother-in-law, in Philadelphia in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   "The concert left a lasting memory on me. I was 7," said Propis,
who turned 43 on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of re-creating it came to him while he was playing  golf
with other cantors at a national conference. As each man got up to
the tee, he would sing an aria that required a high C, then he would
hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It worked so well, we said, 'Is it time for a concert? We could
do this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Propis hadn't planned on being a cantor, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of lived out 'The Jazz Singer' story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His father taught him (and his sister) to sing in his choir. After
his bar mitzvah, Propis began singing solos and a year later became
his father's choir director until he went off to La Salle College in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   He majored in computer science, not music, and after graduating,
went off to a job in oil-rich Houston. The oil boom quickly went
bust, however.</TE>
<TE>   "My company lasted nine months. I was out of a job. My dad called
me up and said, 'While you're looking, call a friend of mine and see
if he knows of a congregation that needs a cantor. Just in case.' His
lifelong dream was for me to follow in his footsteps."</TE>
<TE>   He landed a one-year contract at Beth Yeshurun that turned into a
permanent job. His first year there, he proposed the idea of the
three-cantor concert as a fund-raising event.</TE>
<TE>   But the high costs involved--the concert requires a full orchestra
as well as the singers--made the congregation wary.</TE>
<TE>   Cantor Put Salary on Line</TE>
<TE>   to Make Benefit Happen</TE>
<TE>   Propis told the membership of his temple he believed in the
concert so much he would put up a year's salary if they didn't make a
minimum $50,000 profit.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'OK, fine.' The first year we made over $100,000. The
second year did even better. Both were sold-out concerts."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the three tenors concert--and the original three cantors
concert--emphasized solos, this one is different.</TE>
<TE>   "Our show is based more on the trios that we sing as opposed to
solos," Propis said. "What we've tried to do is focus not only on
Jewish music but also the Jewish contribution to music in general,
especially American music."</TE>
<TE>   The program will include Broadway and patriotic songs and
contemporary settings of Yiddish, Ladino (the language of Sephardic
Jews) and Hebrew melodies.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the medleys is called, 'There's a Place for Us,'" Propis
said. "It paints a tapestry of the entire Jewish immigration
experience, from the shtetl to America."</TE>
<TE>   The profits will go to the Jewish Community Center of Orange
County and more than 20 other organizations, synagogues and day
schools in Orange County, Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The community center was founded in 1977 in Laguna Beach. It
merged with another center in north Orange County in 1983 and since
the early '90s, it has been based in Costa Mesa. It serves the needs
of its 2000-plus members and the Jewish community through preschool,
youth and senior activities and services. The annual budget is about
$2.8 million, privately raised from individuals, member fees and
foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, we would like to continue doing this kind of
concert," said David Goldberg, director of development at the Jewish
Community Center. "It's a great way of funding the activities not
only at the Jewish Community Center, but throughout the county as
well."</TE>
<TE>   The concert comes at an opportune time. The country is

<DH>A refreshing survey of Jose Clemente Orozco shows his
resolve to have artistic integrity and commercial success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Along with Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jose Clemente
Orozco is known the world over as one of the Big Three leaders of the
Mexican mural movement. But back in 1927, he was a frustrated artist
whose ambitions were not satisfied by hometown opportunities. Leaving
a wife and three daughters behind in Mexico City, he moved to New
York to jump-start his career.</LD>
<LD>   "Jose Clemente Orozco in the United States, 1927-34" paints a
deliciously detailed picture of a pivotal phase in the legendary
muralist's career. At the San Diego Museum of Art, this judicious
survey of more than 110 paintings, drawings and prints is just the
right size: big enough to make significant claims without being
repetitive or visually exhausting.</LD>
<LD>   It is ruthlessly--and refreshingly--unsentimental. Organized for
Dartmouth College's Hood Museum of Art by guest curator Renato
Gonzalez Mello and research curator Diane Miliotes, it refuses to
tell another triumphant tale of a lone genius who beats the odds to
win a place for himself in art history's pantheon of masters.
Instead, the sober show honestly chronicles Orozco's struggle to make
a living making paintings, both public murals and pictures for the
home.</LD>
<TE>   Such radical pragmatism is perfectly suited to the
contradiction-riddled oeuvre of Orozco (1883-1949). His vigorous
figurative paintings are pressure cookers filled to the brim with
simmering mixtures of opportunism and idealism. Long before Warhol
demonstrated that artistic integrity and commercial success can go
hand in glove, Orozco created major works that hold both goals in a
charged alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The first of the exhibition's three sections contains 15 ink
drawings he made within a year of his arrival in New York. Orozco had
started pencil sketches of these page-size pictures in 1926, the year
before he left Mexico City. Based on the graphic style he developed
drawing political cartoons for left- and right-wing newspapers, most
are thoroughly standard depictions of the horrors of war.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively titled "Mexico in Revolution," they include three
versions of a group of mourning women; three views of lynched men;
corpses strewn around a dynamited train; victims fleeing an
explosion; and a rape scene. "Wounded" is the grisliest, with two
uniformed soldiers torturing a man lying naked in a makeshift
hospital, alongside a blind triple amputee. (Orozco's own left hand
was amputated when he was 21, after an accident with gunpowder that
also damaged his sight and hearing.)</TE>
<TE>   But "Aristocratic Dance" is the most captivating drawing. In the
center of a ring of sombrero-wearing soldiers stands a man who has
been stripped of his clothes, except for his top hat, which
identifies him as a landowner. Two of the rebel troops fire their
revolvers at his bare feet, forcing him to dance like a puppet.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, pictures like this strive to capture the fear,
humiliation and rage that such revenge-fueled scenes symbolize. But
Orozco's drawing displays no emotional abandon or cathartic release.
Although smirks break out on two of the men's faces, the rest act as
if they're only going through the motions, doing their job just to be
done with it.</TE>
<TE>   That's the same feeling Orozco's 15 drawings convey. In them, he
appears to be doing his perfunctory duty, performing like a robot to
deliver a cartoon version of the Mexican revolution to U.S. viewers
with a taste for such south-of-the-border cliches.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the main reason Orozco moved to New York was to set up
shop in the center of the American art market. In Mexico, his career
had reached a plateau. A market for portable works of art did not
exist there, and state-sponsored mural commissions were entangled in
bureaucratic complications. In the U.S., interest in the Mexican
muralists, most notably Diego Rivera, was keen.</TE>
<TE>   The next section of the exhibition is the most stylistically
diverse and conceptually messy. It's also the most fascinating. The
majority of its 44 works are oils on canvas. Examples from a series
of 20 lithographs, many based on earlier drawings, are also included.</TE>
<TE>   Made to be sold, they feature generalized scenes of mourning and
patriotism. Orozco selected these subjects because he thought they'd
be more palatable to an American audience than grim scenes of
violence and death. He wasn't wrong: The inexpensive prints sold
briskly. He based additional images on murals he had painted in
Mexico City, hoping to find similar commissions here.</TE>
<TE>   While Orozco was not opposed to marketing his prints so brazenly,
he wanted more from his canvases. At the time, folkloric images of
Mexico were popular. But, over his first three years in New York, he
couldn't bear to churn out such romanticized fantasies. Criticizing
Rivera for packaging his identity and his homeland in this fashion,
Orozco turned his attention to his new surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   He used a gloomy palette of murky browns, dirty grays and vacant
blacks to paint looming bridges, shadowy subway tunnels, ghostly
laborers and alienated office workers. Drawing on the realism of New
York's Ash Can School and the barbed sarcasm of German painting from
the Weimar era, he mocked the pretensions of uptown snobs, producing
undistinguished works that wore their politics on their sleeve. The
stock market's crash and the Depression provided ample fodder for his
socially conscious imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Far more compelling are his enigmatic works in which he dabbles in
such modern styles as Symbolism, Surrealism, abstraction and
proto-Pop. In these odd experiments, Orozco borrows and distorts the
signature handiwork of Giorgio de Chirico, Joseph Stella, Stuart
Davis and Charles Sheeler. Although he quickly dismissed his
unflattering homages as belonging to an "ivory tower interlude," some
of their elements made their way into his murals.</TE>
<TE>   Even stranger are Orozco's paintings dedicated to the activities
of the Delphic Circle, an international salon run by a wealthy Greek
American, Eva Sikelianos. A portrait of her and a self-portrait stand
out like sore thumbs. They invoke rich inner lives, an indulgence
Orozco never allowed himself in any of his other works, all of which
focus on relationships between groups of people rather than on the
invisible dramas that unfold within individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, "Embrace," "Vigil," "Drama" and "Have Another" wrestle
with the presence of interior psychological states. But they fail
dramatically. These troubled explorations recall Orozco's early
murals (some of which he was forced to re-paint), in which symbols of
Freemasonry and other esoteric codes appear.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, Orozco's hard-line stance against sentimental
images of Mexico softened. He painted pictures of his homeland in the
bright colors and simplified forms of what he had previously
disparaged as a hopelessly folkloric style. Iconic images of Emiliano
Zapata and Pancho Villa also reveal a shift in his assessment of the
rebel leaders, or at least the willingness to use them as symbols of
what he wanted from his art.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition's final section is organized around the three major
murals Orozco painted in the United States from 1930-1934:
"Prometheus" in Frary Hall, a dining room at Pomona College in
Claremont; an untitled cycle of images at the New School for Social
Research in New York; and "The Epic of American Civilization," in
Baker Library at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   Because the murals cannot be moved, viewers are presented with 53
studies, preparatory sketches and transfer sheets that Orozco used to
paint them, as well as photographic reproductions of some of their
scenes. (A digital projection that takes you on a virtual tour of the
three sites is scheduled to run continuously in a side gallery, but
it was not yet installed for the media preview on the morning of the
show's opening.)</TE>
<TE>   Some of the drawings reveal changes Orozco made as he worked out
the compositions of his monumental images. Others are carefully
finished products, souvenirs to be sold to collectors.</TE>
<TE>   The murals are Orozco's American masterpieces. To see them in
sequence, even in reproduction, is to watch his talent, ambition and
achievement grow exponentially.</TE>
<TE>   "Prometheus" (1930) is defiance personified. At one end of the
dining hall, a neo-Gothic arch barely contains the figure's upward
thrust. If Michelangelo's "David" had a younger brother who was a
rabble-rousing punk, this would be his portrait. Stealing fire from
the gods, he triumphs over adversity only to be crushed by it.
Victory and defeat go hand in hand in Orozco's modern rendition of
the ancient Greek myth.</TE>
<TE>   Complexity and ambivalence also unfold in the New School mural.
Flanked by images of toiling laborers and portraits of Gandhi, Lenin
and Stalin, the centerpiece of this four-walled work is "Table of
Universal Brotherhood." Although its title conjures Utopian images of
peace and harmony, Orozco depicts nothing of the sort. At a square
table, 11 men of various ethnicities sit stiffly, staring blankly, as
if the conversation had died and is impossible to revive. Imagine a
Thanksgiving dinner among strangers with no food and nothing to say
to one another and you'll have an idea of the discomfort this picture
makes palpable.</TE>
<TE>   "The Epic of American Civilization," which wraps more than a dozen
scenes around a library reading room, is a polyglot concoction in
which historical and mythical figures march in a cyclical parade
filled with mind-blowing surprises. Quetzalcoatl resembles Moses;
Christ uses an ax to chop down his cross (like George Washington and
the cherry tree) and then sheds his dead skin, like a snake, to
emerge renewed, vigorous and ready for anything.</TE>
<TE>   Orozco's public murals and domestically scaled paintings are
impossible to divide into two tidy groups. Their complex goals often
overlap, blurring the boundary between reality and imagination,
Utopianism and pragmatism. The years Orozco spent in the U.S. taught
him that giving people what they want is not the same as giving us
what we expect. Taking that lesson back to Mexico, he went on to even
bigger and better things, billboard-scale paintings that clobber you
with their obviousness and then get under your skin with their
weirdness.</TE>

<HD>Vienna's Masterful Bruckner</HD>
<DH>Under Bernard Haitink, the orchestra with the zealously
guarded tradition successfully scales the Eighth Symphony, a musical
zenith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Vienna Philharmonic does not show concern about its, or music's,
future. It may be willing, from time to time, to try something
new--which for it means tackling a Stravinsky symphony conducted by
Pierre Boulez or peeling away a layer or two of accumulated
performance tradition in standard repertory with the help of a period
instrument specialist such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Last spring, the
Viennese orchestra even took the extraordinary measure of playing a
solemn memorial performance under Simon Rattle on the site of a
concentration camp and publicly acknowledged its culpability in the
Nazi cause during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   But for all that, this exceptional orchestra regards its
tradition, its direct lineage to many of the greatest composers and
conductors of all time, as a supreme, untarnished glory.</LD>
<LD>   Thus some of us outside that traditional mind-set might enter a
Vienna Philharmonic concert consumed by our own issues. For instance,
we count women players. As the musicians walked on stage at
Segerstrom Hall on Monday night, for the first of the orchestra's
three programs under Bernard Haitink at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center, I spotted a couple of female violists; the two harpists,
one of each gender; I didn't get a clear look at the wind players.</LD>
<TE>   There wasn't, however, much time to count or ponder. The orchestra
does not tune up on stage, and the program consisted of a single
work, Bruckner's monumental Eighth Symphony, and--serious occasion
that it was-- it commenced nearly on the appointed hour, like a
funeral or wedding. From its first notes, the orchestra made Bruckner
all that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Bruckner's symphonies are revelations that emerge from
mysteriousness. The Eighth edges into life with a single pitch in the
horns and violins, the stirrings of a theme emerging from the lower
strings. Within a few bars, there are brass fanfares, luminous wind
chords, an irresistible striding melody in the strings, and a
sensation of something momentous happening.</TE>
<TE>   The character of that sensation Monday was hard to pinpoint. It
had to do with the unique combination of power and beauty that is the
Viennese sound. It had to do with Bruckner's supreme confidence that,
however much we suffer, God is good. It had to with an orchestra that
is supremely certain of the rightness of what it is playing at the
moment it is playing it.</TE>
<TE>   Bruckner's Eighth has been called the zenith of symphonic
literature. And it is. The last symphony the Austrian composer
completed and his grandest musical statement, it was also, in the
1880s, the largest major symphonic work yet conceived by any
composer. Symphonies as large, or even larger, would be written
afterward, especially by Mahler, but none with Bruckner's trusting in
the purity of the form.</TE>
<TE>   The Eighth is huge. In a slow performance, as this one was, its
Adagio movement alone can last close to half an hour. And it isn't
all dutiful affirmation. Often harmonically vague, the music wanders,
pierced by outbursts of angst. The Adagio sings the blues on a
mammoth scale. In the thundering Finale, the glimpses of heaven, in a
small visionary moment near the end of the exposition and again in
the recapitulation, are fleeting and seem, at first, to come out of
nowhere, unsupported.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is a grand plan. Themes are moldable and interlock. The
peroration of the symphony is not a triumphant resolution, however
loud and thunderous and glorious are those final pages of the score,
but rather a culmination of all that has come before. Beethoven
overcame obstacles in his symphonies. Bruckner accepted them. The
magnificent cadence at the end comes from the church not the concert
hall.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of the Eighth on Monday night was a great one. The
symphony is special to these musicians, and they won't play it for
conductors who don't understand that. Two of the orchestra's latest
recordings are of the Eighth. One is a historic re-release of a 1957
live performance by Herbert von Karajan, who conducted it often with
the orchestra, including at the end of his life when he was in
particular need of spiritual balm. Another is a recent performance by
Boulez; it was his first encounter with Bruckner, and for it, he went
to the source.</TE>
<TE>   Haitink is an experienced Brucknerian. He conducted and recorded
all the symphonies in the 1970s and 1980s, when he was music director
of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. Those recordings
are beautifully played, expertly controlled but without much
character. His interpretation Monday was even more stately, but here
the Dutch conductor brought a new urgency. He showed that he knew
everything the Viennese players could do, and he encouraged them to
be expressive within small details, but never lost the large picture.</TE>
<TE>   The result, ironically for an orchestra more bound to music
history than any other, was a performance in which time and history
seemed to vanish. Bruckner's chromatic harmonies, pungent
counterpoint and massed blocks became a sound world onto themselves,
lived for the moment. Every section--strings, brass, winds,
percussion--sounded wondrous on its own. The horns were to die for.
Yet all blended into a sonic whole far greater than the sum of its
luscious parts.</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna Philharmonic is not a blameless or blemishless
organism, but it cannot play as it did on Monday without a heart and
a soul.</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna Philharmonic performs a program of Brahms, Haydn and
Strauss tonight, 8 p.m., Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, $34-$109, (949) 553-2422.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Kissing Jessica Stein" has the look and feel of a smart, stylish New
York romantic comedy in which the principals are articulate and
forthright about their intelligence and sophistication. Yet for an
American film it is a groundbreaker in exploring the realm of sexual
fluidity, and it does so with wit, wisdom and in a completely
entertaining fashion. It has the sheen of a polished Hollywood
production but is never glossy or glib as it deals with serious
matters with delicacy, good humor and, at times, outright hilarity.</LD>
<LD>   Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a beautiful but neurotic
newspaper journalist who aspires to be a painter. She is 28 and has
yet to find Mr. Right. Her single state is of great concern to her
doting mother, Judy (Tovah Feldshuh), a chic Scarsdale, N.Y., matron.</LD>
<LD>   That her older brother has just announced he's getting married and
that Joan (Jackie Hoffman), her best pal at work, has become pregnant
increases the pressure on her and triggers a disastrous dating spree.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), an assistant
director of a trendy downtown art gallery, has just placed a
woman-seeking-woman ad in a personals column that begins with a quote
from a poem that catches Joan's attention--and which Jessica
recognizes as a quote from Rilke. Intrigued, Jessica answers it on
impulse.</TE>
<TE>   Helen is far more worldly and experienced than Jessica. Indeed,
she manages to juggle three male lovers, seeing each according to
mood, while seeking out a passionate lesbian relationship. Jessica is
so tremendously uptight at the prospect of sexual intimacy with a
woman that she puts Helen's patience and audacity to the test. When
Jessica at last capitulates, she stumbles into bliss.</TE>
<TE>   She also faces a whole new set of challenges. She cherishes the
intimacy more than the sex that the lustier Helen provides, and Helen
expects Jessica to be open about their relationship--and that
includes Jessica's family. All of this provides plenty of mostly
comical complications out of which Jessica discovers how complex
sexual identity can be, especially for a woman. It may well be that
she is attracted to Helen more as a person than as a woman--that it
may well be easier in our society for women to explore same-sex
relationships yet retain a basically heterosexual orientation than it
is for men. Despite her having men in her life, Helen is eager to
pursue an intensely sexual relationship with another woman and sees
herself as primarily a lesbian. The fact that neuroticism has been
supplanted by happiness in Jessica has a major impact on her editor,
Josh (Scott Cohen), who is also a former boyfriend. From childhood,
Jessica has set high standards for herself and others, and their
relationship foundered when Josh gave up his dream of becoming an
important writer to settle for editing the work of others. He is a
bright, good-looking man with a prickly personality who clearly has
never gotten over losing Jessica.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's Scott is multidimensional as is Westfeldt's Jessica,
Juergensen's Helen and Feldshuh's Judy, who comes on as the
classically anxious and manipulative Jewish mother. But played by
Feldshuh with affectionate comic flourish, this most accomplished of
actresses has the opportunity to pull back and show us how perceptive
and wise this most loving of mothers really is. What a pleasure it is
to see Feldshuh receive a role of such breadth and depth.  The
screenplay, by Juergensen and Westfeldt, attracted the attention of
theater veteran and cinema fledgling Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, who as
director has said he saw that his task was "to create a visually
dynamic cinematic environment from a script that was theatrically
based." That is precisely what he has accomplished so gracefully:
"Kissing Jessica Stein" is intensely verbal yet never seems merely
talky or stagy. Lawrence Sher's camerawork is crucial in bringing a
glowing vitality to a film that calls for the smoothness of a studio
production rather than low-budget grit. "Kissing Jessica Stein" could
turn out to be a sleeper, a date-night movie for open-minded couples.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sexual content and language. Times guidelines:
Complex adult themes; sex is off-screen, but the language is blunt.</TE>

<LD>Imagine climbing on board a helicopter in Tuscany and being told
you're about to tour Northern Italy for the next hour.</LD>
<LD>   On your itinerary: the entire geographic area starting from
Florence to the Alpine foothills. Along the way, you find yourself
zigzagging from west to east and back again, from expansive farmlands
to gnarled vineyards to sun-washed beaches lined with row after row
of sunbathers and yachts floating in turquoise harbors.</LD>
<LD>   "Visions of Italy: Northern Style" (at 8 tonight, KCET-TV) takes
the viewer on a dizzying bird's-eye view of a magnificent landscape
over historic cities and lush fields without pausing very long at any
particular destination.</LD>
<TE>   In Verona, for example, one catches a glimpse of an elegant,
crumpled Roman arena as narrator Franca Barciesi offers pithy, often
pretentious commentary ("One can almost hear the clashing swords of
Montagues and Capulets ... ") before it's off to elegant, cool
Treviso.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps realizing the limitations of a helicopter-mounted camera,
producer and writer Sam Toperoff makes a concerted effort to include
not only rooftops and scenic areas but also images of people.
Cross-country skiers in Livigno, staffers at Benetton and a
frantically waving family in a field at Rocca Maggiore provide
welcome human faces.</TE>
<TE>   Divided into three segments, the program is accompanied by
recognizable Italian music selections.</TE>
<TE>   The journey ends at the pristine, glacier-fed waters of Lake Como,
followed by a series of postcard snapshots of the trip's highlights.
Like most postcards, they only capture faint memories of a region. As
narrator Barciesi says, "To capture the soul of Italy would take a
lifetime."</TE>

<LD>Sunday's documentary film on CBS, "9/11," drew blockbuster ratings,
combining with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and a solid second
outing for "Survivor: Marquesas" to pace the network to victory,
based on estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   "Survivor" improved slightly over its premiere, again trailing
"Friends" in their common half-hour while surpassing NBC's new sitcom
"Leap of Faith," which slipped by nearly 30% from the "Friends"
plateau.</LD>
<LD>   The week-to-week decline was nearly as steep for the second
installment of NBC's Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy "Watching Ellie,"
which faced somewhat tougher competition than its premiere, with "The
West Wing" star Martin Sheen guest starring opposite the show on son
Charlie's ABC series, "Spin City."</LD>
<TE>   Reflecting just how far ABC has fallen, the network's most-watched
program last week, "The Practice," came in at No. 28 overall, with
ratings for the courtroom show taking a tumble opposite "9/11," the
highest-rated program this season other than sporting events such as
the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics. ABC's audience was down more than
35% versus the corresponding week last year.</TE>

<HD>A Festival That Pops With Edge</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* UCLA's ambitious All Tomorrow's Parties fest,
curated by avant-rockers Sonic Youth, embraces the underground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The music business begins its annual exodus to Austin, Texas, for the
South by Southwest music conference and festival today, and this year
members of the slumping industry will descend on the Texas capital in
the hopes of finding some signs of creative rejuvenation.</LD>
<LD>   But if they're seeking the leading edge in music, they should head
to Westwood instead.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Thursday, UCLA will kick off All Tomorrow's Parties, a
four-day festival of venturesome music that whipsaws from slightly
left of center to truly subterranean.</LD>
<TE>   In its depth and stylistic sweep, All Tomorrow's Parties (the name
is the title of a Velvet Underground song) is arguably the most
ambitious music festival in recent Los Angeles history.</TE>
<TE>   Curated by New York avant-rock pioneers Sonic Youth, All
Tomorrow's Parties features a handful of familiar names (Pearl Jam's
Eddie Vedder, former Pavement frontman Stephen Malkmus, Wilco), a
clutch of bands expanding the purview of experimental rock (Bardo
Pond, US Maple, Unwound) and some veteran mavericks (Lydia Lunch,
Royal Trux's Neil Michael Hagerty, jazz pianist Cecil Taylor).</TE>
<TE>   There will also be reunions of the great late-'70s New York
quartet Television and Memphis pop band Big Star (with cult hero Alex
Chilton) and such events as a tribute to the Stooges featuring Mike
Watt, J. Mascis and original Stooges, Ron and Scott Asheton. All
told, 50 acts will perform for about 12,500 ticket-holders, primarily
in 1,800-seat Royce Hall and 2,300-capacity Ackerman Grand Ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   The festival was originally scheduled for last October but was
postponed after the events of Sept. 11. That resulted in about
$40,000 in lost revenue, according to Barry Hogan, who founded ATP
two years ago in his native England. "We had paid for advertising and
had put deposits on bands that we couldn't get back," he says. "But
it will all pay for itself in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan and UCLA have spent roughly $250,000 on the performers and
an additional $150,000 on marketing, promotion, security and the
stage gear.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA is used to dealing with jazz artists and dance events, so we
had to bring in PA systems and lights," says Hogan, who temporarily
moved to Los Angeles from his London home to help organize the event.
"Because you can buy a wristband for both venues, we also had to hire
security to secure all the exits. That didn't come cheap."</TE>
<TE>   According to Hogan, the expenses will be covered by the time Sonic
Youth closes the show Sunday evening. That concert has been sold out
for weeks, and Friday and Saturday are on the verge of selling out as
well.</TE>
<TE>   That's heartening for everyone involved, given the challenging
roster that Sonic Youth pulled together for the event.</TE>
<TE>   "We were asked to make a wish list, and we had pages and pages of
bands," says Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore. "We showed it to
[UCLA], then figured out how to crystallize it into [four] days."</TE>
<TE>   Underground music fans may feast on Sonic Youth's lineup, but they
have David Sefton, who became director of UCLA Performing Arts in the
winter of 2000, to thank for bringing ATP to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When he was director of contemporary culture at London's Royal
Festival Hall, Sefton came up with the idea of inviting artists to
create festivals built around the music in their own record
collections: One "curator" could pick all of his or her favorite
songs and the artists to perform them.</TE>
<TE>   The Meltdown Festival, which began in 1994 and has featured Laurie
Anderson, Nick Cave and David Bowie among its curators, became a huge
critical and commercial success in London and inspired the first All
Tomorrow's Parties, held in East Sussex in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   ATP organizer Hogan appropriated Meltdown's
artist-as-booking-agent strategy, offering such rearguard performers
as Scottish band Mogwai and Chicago ensemble Tortoise as guest
programmers. This week's ATP is the first to be mounted in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing in All Tomorrow's Parties opens up a totally different
world to UCLA, one that it has never engaged in before," says Sefton,
39. "The university has never attempted anything on this scale, with
multiple venues running at the same time." Sefton's mandate as the
head of UCLA's performing arts office has been to bring a sense of
adventure and unpredictability to the program.</TE>
<TE>   A former rock critic and assistant director of the Unity Theatre
in Liverpool and London's Millfield Theatre, Sefton has striven to
create memorable events at UCLA such as last year's tribute concert
to folklorist Harry Smith and January's pairing of singer-songwriter
Mary Chapin Carpenter with writer Anne Lamott.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dream job in a dream location," Sefton says. "There's
an incredible openness in town to this stuff, a real lack of
cynicism. I get a level of excitement from people that's genuinely
rewarding to me as a programmer."</TE>
<TE>   He's not alone in that thinking. Concert promoter Paul Tollett,
whose Goldenvoice firm stages the annual Coachella Music and Arts
Festival in Indio (the third annual edition will be held next month),
calls Los Angeles the country's best market for this kind of event.</TE>
<TE>   "People are way more open to music here, and it just works great,"
Tollett says. "We have the most creative multi-act festivals in the
country here."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, there are other plans afoot. It was Sefton who hired
Elvis Costello as UCLA Performing Arts' artist in residence last
year, though regular patrons are wondering when, if ever, the rock
luminary will begin making his presence felt.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, Sefton concedes, Costello has not been involved in any
decisions regarding programming, though that should change come this
summer with an as-yet-unannounced project.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept the brief very loose with [Costello]," Sefton says. "He's
had an album to record, but there are several major plans in the
offing. It may have gone quiet, but it hasn't gone away."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, there are 50 acts to enjoy this weekend. "I
showed the lineup to all my friends, and they were like, 'You've
gotta take me, man,'" says Ron Asheton, the former Stooges guitarist
who will travel from his home in Ann Arbor, Mich., to perform on
Friday at ATP. "Even my ex-girlfriend called and said, 'I'm going
with you.' I said, 'Oh no you're not!'"</TE>
<TE>   All Tomorrow's Parties, Thursday through Sunday at UCLA, Westwood.
Three-day ticket (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), $100; Friday-Saturday
ticket, $80. Thursday only, $25; Friday or Saturday only, $50; Sunday
only, $35. Check www.UCLALive.com for updates. (310) 825-2101</TE>

<HD>Artemis Quartet a Complex Joy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Germany's Artemis Quartet is one of those dazzling groups that play
"difficult" contemporary music with degrees of precision and
infectious zeal that make believers out of skeptics. The new music
scene needs more such clearheaded, highly musical crusaders.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, difficulty was inherent in this week's Monday Evening
Concert at the Los Angeles County Museum. But the quartet brought
illuminating clarity to complex scores from three towering Hungarian
composers, Ligeti, Kurtag, and Bartok.</LD>
<LD>   Violinists Natalia Prischepenko and Heime Muller alternate in the
first chair, a fitting gesture of unanimity in this tightly meshed
unit, alongside violist Volker Jacobsen and cellist Eckart Runge.
Their unassailable cohesiveness benefited the intricacies of Ligeti's
String Quartet No. 1, "Metamorphoses nocturnes." Tucked into its
fascinating trickery are alternating currents of angst, curiosity and
touches of humor.</LD>
<TE>   Kurtag's "Hommage a Mihaly Andras, 12 Microludes for string
quartet, Opus 13" unveils a dozen short movements, each distinct, but
contributing to a mosaic-like whole. Despite the self-conscious
structure, the impression is of freedom and intellectual probity.</TE>
<TE>   Bartok's Fifth Quartet came after intermission, as if the group
were returning to the source of 20th century Hungarian Modernist
thought. The players moved seamlessly from the second movement's dank
lament to the Scherzo's jaunty dance, and from the final movement's
arduous intensity into the odd nursery rhyme-ish ditty, then back
into Bartok knottiness.</TE>
<TE>   For a contrasting encore, they pulled out Mozart's quartet
transcription of a fugue from Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier."</TE>

<HD>Kids Project Learning Into Community</HD>
<DH>A strategy being used with young pupils merges in-school
lessons with activities that help the world outside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a classroom at Ojai's Topa Topa Elementary School, 11-year-old
would-be reporter Libby Bradley asks Farmer John the tough questions.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you use pesticides on your crops?" "Are they safe for humans?"
"Have any of your workers gotten sick?"</LD>
<LD>   Through the mock interview with fellow student Jonathan Bower,
Libby dramatizes the debate over the use of pesticides on commercial
farms, which is a concern for the Ventura County school surrounded by
citrus and avocado ranches. The exercise is part of a program being
implemented throughout the Ojai Unified School District called
service learning--a teaching strategy that aims to merge classroom
academics with projects that benefit the larger community.</LD>
<TE>   The technique, once used mainly on college and high school
campuses, is gaining popularity among public school students in the
primary grades, beginning as early as kindergarten. Ojai has been one
of the pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two months, teacher Jeff Madrigal's class will produce
an educational pamphlet detailing the pros and cons of pesticide use
and the ways in which crop pickers can protect themselves. Students
will pass out the brochure, which they plan to write in English and
Spanish, to farm workers and consumers throughout the Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The classroom lessons are designed also to help the fifth- and
sixth-graders fulfill state-required standards in language arts,
science and social studies.</TE>
<TE>   "What regular education often lacks is meaning," said Chris
Smithers, Ojai's service learning coordinator. "We have seen that
connecting the students with their community has so many positive
effects."</TE>
<TE>   Education leaders predict that the national trend will continue to
grow amid the spirit of service and volunteerism that followed the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids learn best--and that really goes for younger kids--when they
are engaged in hands-on projects," said Susan Thompson, an
administrator in the California Department of Education. State Supt.
of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin has called for half of
California's schools to implement service learning programs in the
next two years.</TE>
<TE>   The movement is rooted in hands-on traditions, but goes further by
tying assignments to a service. Projects are supposed to meet
specific needs in a community, defined as anything from the school
itself to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Much different from community service assignments that require
students to volunteer after school, service learning directly links
projects to required curriculum and uses class time to get them done.</TE>
<TE>   A new national study by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation found that
such an approach, when executed well, improved student attendance and
achievement, resulting in higher grade-point averages.</TE>
<TE>   Ten elementary schools in Encinitas in north San Diego County,
where service learning has been active for a decade, were a part of
that report.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-grade teacher Carol Kulminski said she thinks the projects
have made the Encinitas community stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about test scores, it's about creating people with a
heart," she said. "It's the kind of thing that keeps me going."</TE>
<TE>   In Ojai, Madrigal's students gushed about the program.</TE>
<TE>   "You can learn while you help the community," said sixth-grader
Alina Downer. "It's boring just sitting around with science books,
memorizing facts."</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Grant Winfrey , 11, agreed. "If we're just hearing it in
class, it's only us learning about it," he said. "If we do a service
learning project, we can teach a lot more people."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the strategy has generated criticism from Oakland to
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Parents have argued that exposing students to serious social
issues such as homelessness could pose a safety threat or involve
children in debatable political agendas.</TE>
<TE>   One example in Moorpark had high school students interacting with
AIDS patients in local hospices. After some parents complained,
teachers scrambled for another project.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics have said the projects could place teachers in roles
that should be left to parents and distract kids from learning
basics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is government coercing people into doing good acts and kind
deeds, and it loses its meaning," said Wendy Leece, board member of
Orange County's Newport-Mesa Unified School District, where some
classes participate in such projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The government's idea of community service is not necessarily the
same as an individual family's idea," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, however, insist that service learning enhances
classroom lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "They're actually using the environment around them to learn,"
said Dorothy Jackson, an administrator in Los Angeles Unified's local
district in North Hollywood, one of three local districts
participating in service learning.</TE>
<TE>   The programs have been so successful, she said, that L.A. Unified
plans to make service learning a requirement for high school
graduation starting in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Hirschl, director of youth services for the Orange County
Volunteer Center, is another believer. For the last two years, he has
worked with local school districts to develop service learning
projects. Next month, 1,800 Orange County fourth-graders will glean
an agriculture field and donate the vegetables to local food banks.</TE>
<TE>   While helping feed the hungry, Hirschl said, the students will
learn about the life of early migrant farm workers--part of their
social studies curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes lessons come alive, and it's something that the kids
will remember," he said. "The beauty of it is that kids find
themselves as being part of a solution to a problem, and a problem
solver in our society. I think that's extremely important."</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years in Ojai, grants totaling more than $100,000
have helped grade-schoolers plant oak trees, adopt a local canyon and
lobby for a better public transportation system, Smithers said.</TE>
<TE>   The money comes mostly from a private national initiative called
Learn and Serve America, which doles out funding to districts through
the state Education Department.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's schools also were among many this year to receive boosts
from a governor's office program centered on Cesar Chavez's birthday,
which is March 31 and is being observed in some places on April 1
this year.</TE>
<TE>   That connection to the late farm workers' leader is partly why
Madrigal's class focused on agricultural pesticides for its project.</TE>
<TE>   From the teacher's perspective, the endeavor has strengthened
students' thirst for knowledge and their desire to help others.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it actually change things in the short term? I don't know,"
he said. "But are you creating a group of people who are empowered to
do things for the community? That's for sure."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have long suspected that the best way to lose weight was to eat
rich food in moderation, not diet food in abundance. During the last
52 weeks, I put that idea to the test.</LD>
<LD>   And I lost 52 pounds. To my knowledge, not a single low-fat food
passed my lips. Nothing beginning with those dread syllables non-,
un-, de- or low-. No "nonundelows."</LD>
<LD>   I did not use diet shakes or a point system or desiccated stuff
marketed as diet food. Dieting, I found, can be done quite
successfully without consuming little pots of no-fat yogurt or watery
no-fat milk.</LD>
<TE>   My diet did not involve signing up with Jenny Craig, consuming
nothing but protein, or taking powdered supplements or soy powder
energy drinks. I did not blame my genes. I never lifted a measuring
cup or weighed a chicken breast.</TE>
<TE>   Dieting, I confirmed, can be done eating whole milk and farmhouse
cheese, chewing the fat on a grilled lamb chop and emptying a bottle
of red wine as you do it, provided you don't do it too often.</TE>
<TE>   Before crooning further, a precautionary note: I am a food lover
and an ideologue, not a nutritionist or physician.</TE>
<TE>   Do see a doctor if you are seriously overweight. I did, along with
a diet counselor at the YMCA, whose utterly disgusting advice about
low-fat foods I ignored, but whose equally disgusting advice about
bran I followed and benefited from.</TE>
<TE>   Back to my glorious success. Losing 52 pounds suggests that I got
fat in the first place. You might well be asking: If I'm so smart,
why did I become so overweight? The answer is greed. That, and the
fact that my self-image was five years out of date.</TE>
<TE>   I was slim and sporty in my 20s and 30s, but after turning 40, I
didn't seem to appreciate that I could not eat the way that I used
to. And I used to be voracious. My gut was a pro. For close to a
decade, I was a restaurant critic for the Independent newspaper in
Britain. I can recall road trips to the provinces where I ate lunch
once and dinner twice in a day.</TE>
<TE>   One trip, when I wanted to polish off the menu to file my report
the next day, I ate two main courses and four desserts in one
sitting, which included Lancashire hotpot and sticky toffee pudding.</TE>
<TE>   I was such a good eater, I became too snobbish to enjoy my own
food: a critic who didn't cook. But eating food that someone else
made, anyone else made--that was a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   Here in L.A., I got in the habit of eating low, middle and high.
Monday was doughnuts; Tuesday was a burger and thick fries with
mayonnaise and slaw at the local bar; Wednesday was Domino's pizza
and television or a trip to Versailles for garlic chicken and custard
pies; Thursday was sandwich night at Campanile; Friday was
margaritas, guacamole and chicken wings at El Cholo; Saturday
was--with luck--a barbecue at my brother's place followed by a cake
made by my sister-in-law; Sunday was some humble steaming bowl of
pasta with Gorgonzola sauce.</TE>
<TE>   When I discovered a new food, I liked to eat it repeatedly, the
way someone else might play a new CD. When I discovered fish and
chips at Tony's, a seaside place in Tomales Bay, I ate there four
nights running. (I still like learning food by repetition, only in
slightly smaller quantities.)</TE>
<TE>   Other contributors to my expansion, as if I needed them, were
probably metabolic changes that attend turning 40, a move from a
place where I'd walked everywhere to a place where I drove everywhere
and quitting smoking. My doctor assures me that kicking that habit
guarantees a 15-pound gain. About 16 months ago, wheezing and worried
about my lungs, not my girth, I promised myself I'd lose the 15
pounds along with the considerable existing store of blubber "later."</TE>
<TE>   "Later" arrived by February, almost exactly a year ago, as I was
standing in line at a drugstore checkout, staring at other customers
in the security video, and found myself marveling that the fat lady
ahead of me was also buying Nicorette. Then I realized that the fat
lady was me.</TE>
<TE>   On an even more piercing note, I found myself smitten by a fella
whom I saw as a prospect. It didn't work out. He saw me as no more
than a drinking buddy who, to his amazement, could out-drink him.
"They say it's body fat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   These were such rude shocks that all my eating and drinking
personalities were summarily called to a bargaining table. I was on a
diet, and, like it or not, they were, too.</TE>
<TE>   Some vices had to go. Some could stay, the nonnegotiable
pleasures. Habits like doughnut-, cookie- and candy-eating were
banished completely. Candy allowance: one bar of Valrhona dark
chocolate a month.</TE>
<TE>   Then the bargaining became tough. Pasta was eliminated. Bread was
rationed to one hot roll a week (slathered with butter at a Saturday
lunch in a favorite Santa Monica restaurant), half a bread basket at
Campanile (where bread is worth the calories) or garlic bread at my
lunch place.</TE>
<TE>   Half a bottle of wine at night was cut to one glass. Two jiggers
of Jameson's were permitted, or a bottle of beer, but no mixed
drinks. Those sugary margaritas at El Cholo were right out.</TE>
<TE>   My milk, yogurt and cheese consumption were all left alone. Fish
was raised to two sushi lunches a week; red meat was cut down to my
brother's barbecues, a T-bone on Christmas Eve, leg of lamb at
Easter, a monthly dinner of lamb or pork chops--and one spicy Italian
salami a month, to serve as weekend snacks on heavy gardening days or
treats with olives when friends came by.</TE>
<TE>   Much of my protein, I decided, would come from chicken and eggs.
Fruit and vegetable consumption would exceed protein by a ratio of no
less than two to one. Olive oil would be used generously to dress
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   A typical weekday's food now begins with a breakfast of bran
cereal, the kind of granary floor sweepings that pass as breakfast
cereal and pack about 80 calories a cup. This is dressed with Straus
Family Creamery whole-milk yogurt, thick Greek-style stuff that is
quite simply the best on the market, spiced with a teaspoon of honey
and topped by a diced banana and a diced apple. To drink: a mug of
coffee with whole milk and orange juice squeezed from two oranges.</TE>
<TE>   Midmorning, there is a foaming latte. For lunch: sushi or a
chicken Caesar salad with garlic bread and iced tea. For dinner, a
two-egg omelet with goat cheese, steamed broccoli dressed with olive
oil, lemon, chile flakes and garlic, green salad and more fruit
dressed with more whole-milk yogurt. Not just "some" fruit but a pint
of blueberries or strawberries. Ah, and wine. On weekends, add two
slices of salami, some olives, a square from a bar of Valrhona and
another glass of wine.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit has become a great passion. Fruit used to rot in my house.
Now I run out. I easily eat three apples, two oranges and a banana a
day. The packing-house stickers are becoming a bother in my compost.
The apple, I find, is in a renaissance in California and Washington.
Fujis, Pink Ladies and Galas are all full of flavor this year. Duff
specimens used to be the rule; now they're rare.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, I eat Oxnard strawberries from the Santa Monica
farmers markets by the pint. In summer, blueberries are wolfed down
with the same kind of glee. Straus yogurt goes on both of these. I
gorge on plums six at a time, with a towel as a bib. Peaches, which
tend to ripen all at the same time, are also eaten by the bagful.</TE>
<TE>   Salad, too, is a standard with me--not as a side dish, but as a
meal. One bag of pre-washed spinach or arugula with goat cheese and a
sliced Hass avocado, dressed with good olive oil, red wine vinegar
and sea salt is a regular dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I've always loved vegetables, so eating lots of them isn't a new
habit. But in California, we are equipped with quite the steadiest
supply of glorious rough stuff that I have ever seen. I love spinach,
particularly from farmers markets, and eat it as fast as I can wash
it. I can eat asparagus by the pound, artichokes till my fingers
bleed. I adore beets. In season I steam them and serve them hot with
nothing but good sea salt. On omelet nights, I eat entire bundles of
broccoli that are meant to be family-sized.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonings are important. Nothing improves an omelet like grainy
Dijon-style mustard, good coarse sea salt, freshly ground pepper and
plenty of herbs. Cottage cheese is a good, fast hunger-buster, if you
douse it with olive oil to give it some flavor.</TE>
<TE>   I've always been picky about olive oil and keep a low-grade "extra
virgin," the $5-a-bottle stuff, for greasing the omelet pan, and I
indulge in the really good stuff for dressing salads and steamed
vegetables. I do not measure it; I just pour the amount to dress the
food without leaving it swimming in grease.</TE>
<TE>   Two luxurious favorites with distinct tastes are the flowery and
relatively mild Alziari Provencal oil and greener, strong and
delicious Tuscan Laudemio. Both are sold at Surfas in West Los
Angeles. Note: Once you open oil, it begins to go rancid. No matter
how decorative the bottle, store it in a cool dark cupboard or it
will turn in the heat and light.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the result of this diet was not simply weight loss, not
simply fresh delight in rediscovering good, simple things; it was
vigor. My eyes are brighter, my skin is better and--to the
astonishment of my neighbors--I now bound out of the house in the
morning wearing a sweatsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings the story to the exercise part. I didn't lose weight
just by eating all this good stuff and tossing back Pinot Noir. I
lost weight eating good, nourishing food that gave me energy to
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   This started with cycling six miles to work and then home. As the
weather got hotter, I began stopping at the Y for a swim and a
shower. When I can't cycle, I do 20 minutes on the cross-trainer. I
am now a dedicated lap swimmer and do at least 20 and often 30 or 40
lengths in the pool five days a week. A pleasant byproduct is that
the swimming reduces stress. My insomnia is gone.</TE>
<TE>   The most pleasing transformation brought on by all this activity
has been at the table. Food tastes better than it ever did. After a
cycle and swim, a slab of Colston Basset Stilton, a few oatcakes, a
watercress and endive salad, California Pink Lady apple and a Samuel
Adams beer is a princely reward. A year into the diet, I am not only
52 pounds lighter, but eating the best food of my life and enjoying
it the most.</TE>

<LD>Entertaining? Guests love the informality and ease of a soup party.
Make this robust, highly flavorful Italian pasta and bean soup the
centerpiece of the gathering. Pasta e fagioli is an Italian classic,
always varied according to the cook's preferences and creativity.</LD>
<LD>   I made several batches and opted for fresh rosemary over dried,
prosciutto over smoked ham, canned beans over cooking dried beans and
a final swirl of arugula leaves. The soup develops rich flavors when
made a day or two ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Serve warm baguette slices with gremolata butter; gremolata is a
mixture of minced parsley, lemon zest and garlic that is typically
sprinkled over osso buco. It adds a fresh edge to the bread. And for
dessert, offer a coffee biscuit tortoni with amaretto cream.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 (1-pound, 4-ounce) baguette, cut in half, halves split
lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the parsley, lemon zest, garlic, butter and salt in a
mini-processor or small bowl. Mix until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Spread each quarter of the bread with the mixture, dividing
evenly. (This can be made a day ahead and refrigerated or frozen up
to 1 month.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, bake the bread, cut side up, in a single layer on a
baking sheet until just beginning to brown, about 15 minutes (bake
the bread slightly longer if frozen). Cut each into 4 pieces. Serve
hot.</TE>

<TE>   Beat the egg whites with 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar until
thick but not dry. Place the gelato in a mixing bowl and stir until
smooth; don't let it become too liquid. Fold in the egg whites. Spoon
the mixture into each cup, dividing evenly. Smooth the top with a
spatula. Sprinkle on the remaining crumbs. Freeze at least 2 hours or
as long as 1 week, covered airtight.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the cream and the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar until
thick. Add the amaretto. Mix well. (This can be made several hours
ahead and refrigerated, covered airtight.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, let the biscuit tortonis sit at room temperature for 10
minutes. Top each with about 2 tablespoons of the amaretto cream.
Serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Italian Pasta and Bean Soup With Arugula (Pasta e Fagioli)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Make this at least a day ahead for flavors to develop, up to the
point of adding the arugula. It's easiest to dice the prosciutto when
partially frozen.</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 (1/4-pound) slice prosciutto, diced small</TE>
<TE>   2 red onions, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   5 ribs celery, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 large fennel bulb, trimmed, diced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound small mushrooms, stems trimmed, quartered</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon minced garlic, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 (15-ounce) can small white beans, rinsed and drained</TE>
<TE>   1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   1 (49-ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   3 ounces small pasta such as small shells or tubetti, cooked
according to package directions, drained</TE>
<TE>   2 cups trimmed baby arugula leaves</TE>
<TE>   Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large pot over high heat. When hot, add the
prosciutto. Cook, stirring often, until the prosciutto is browned and
crispy on the edges, about 2 minutes. Add the onions, celery, fennel,
mushrooms, 1 tablespoon of garlic and the rosemary. Cook over
medium-high heat, stirring often, until the onion is softened, about
7 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the beans, tomatoes, broth, red pepper flakes and pepper to
taste. Mix. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer; cook,
partially covered, stirring often to avoid sticking, for about 45
minutes. Stir in the pasta and remaining 1 teaspoon of garlic; cook 5
minutes more. Taste; adjust seasonings. Be wary of adding salt as the
cheese garnish adds more. (This can be made 3 days ahead and
refrigerated or frozen up to 1 month. It's OK if the soup becomes
very thick. To serve, gently reheat, adding water as needed to thin;
keep the consistency thick but with some visible liquid. Taste;
adjust seasoning.) Stir in the arugula; cook 30 seconds. Serve hot,
passing the cheese separately.</TE>

<HD>The Chocolate Exhibit</HD>
<DH>A mouthwatering show is heading to our town next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>At the Field Museum, you can learn about the history, culture and
science of chocolate, and even take in some interesting trivia:
Americans eat an average of 12 pounds of chocolate per person each
year, for example.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of "Chocolate," a traveling exhibition that runs
through Dec. 31.</LD>
<LD>   It arrives at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County
next Feb. 14.</LD>
<TE>   The allure of chocolate and the love affair people have with it
are what made chocolate stand out as a topic worth an entire
exhibition, said Virginia Trice, project administrator.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is as much about the culture of the people who have
harvested, sold and devoured chocolate over the centuries as about
chocolate itself.</TE>
<TE>   It includes agriculture tools, pre-Columbian ceramics and ritual
objects, European silver and porcelain chocolate services,
20th-century cocoa tins, advertising signs, decorative chocolate
molds, old recipe booklets, a vending machine where people once could
buy Hershey candy bars for 1 cent each--even a brightly covered
package that once held chocolate cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Who first sampled the cacao seeds that would ultimately become the
chocolate of Halloween treats, Easter bunny creations, Valentine's
Day candy and even military rations?</TE>
<TE>   It may well have been the monkeys, rodents and birds living near
the rain forest trees. They break into the football-size pods growing
on tree trunks, eat the sweet pulp and spit out the bitter seeds.</TE>
<TE>   The cacao plant was domesticated at an early date in the tropical
lowlands of eastern Mexico. People learned to let the cacao seeds
ferment, then to roast, crush and boil them with water and
flavorings.</TE>
<TE>   "Human beings are tinkerers," says Jonathan Haas, an anthropology
curator at the museum. "We like to try things. And when most of your
diet comes from corn, you're going to be looking for variety."</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs later picked up on chocolate and, between the 13th and
16th centuries, treated it as a drink served to the elite in lavishly
decorated vessels.</TE>
<TE>   They also used the valuable cacao seeds as money.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate didn't get sweet until the 16th century, when the
Spanish mixed sugar with cacao to get rid of the bitter taste.</TE>
<TE>   By 1700, London had almost 2,000 chocolate houses, similar to
today's coffeehouses before they turned into men's social clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy, chocolate was the preferred drink of 18th century Roman
Catholic cardinals, who had it brought in while electing a new pope.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate became less expensive to produce and therefore more
accessible after a Dutch chemist in 1828 invented the cocoa press,
which extracts cocoa butter from chocolate and leaves the powder
known as cocoa.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years later, the first box of chocolates and later the first
Valentine's Day candy box hit the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chef Jacques Torres, who left New York's Le Cirque
restaurant to open Jacques Torres Chocolate retail shop in Brooklyn,
N.Y., last year, calls chocolate "a magical product," so versatile it
can be made into cakes, ice cream, drinks, cookies and more.</TE>
<TE>   "Chocolate is like a diamond," he said recently. "It has a lot of
different facets."</TE>

<LD>Possibly no musician has ever had more fun than Slim Gaillard, a
guitarist and jive singer popular in the late '40s and early '50s....
(Hang on, there'll be a food angle eventually. Just wait.)</LD>
<LD>   Gaillard invented a much-quoted jive-talk language, exemplified in
hit songs such as "Flat-Foot Floogie (With a Floy Floy)." It was big
on nonsense words like "vout-o-rootie" and "vootimo" and all-purpose
suffixes like "-oroonio."</LD>
<LD>   It probably represents the exotic welter of languages Gaillard
heard when he was growing up in Detroit during the teens and '20s of
the last century, when people from all over the world flocked there
to work in the auto factories. Of course, there was also that unique
learning experience of accompanying his father, a steward on an ocean
liner, on a trip to the Mediterranean and being accidentally left on
the island of Crete for six months.</LD>
<TE>   He clearly spent part of his youth hanging out in Detroit's
Lebanese neighborhoods, because he tossed Lebanese dialect words into
some of his songs. And here we get to the food; in 1951 he recorded
"Yip Roc Heresy," basically a list of Lebanese dishes (pronounced
with a pretty good accent, -oroonios aside) sung to a jump tune.
(Yapraq is a name for stuffed grape leaves and hariseh is a sort of
wheat porridge with lamb in it. Kibbeh is a paste of lamb and bulgur
wheat that can be cooked in a variety of ways.) It goes:</TE>
<TE>   Yip Roc Heresy,</TE>
<TE>   kibbeh siniyya (baked kibbeh), kibbeh ba' (probably short for
"batata," meaning with mashed potatoes),</TE>
<TE>   laham (meat) mack voutee.</TE>
<TE>   Yip Roc Heresy,</TE>
<TE>   laham mishwi (shish kebab), laham mishvoutee,</TE>
<TE>   laham misharoonimo.</TE>
<TE>   And so it continued, with the odd "mack foonio" and "sivootee"
thrown in, not to mention "lamb-oroonio" and even "chili with tomato
sauce." Without a doubt, it was the single greatest jazz lyric of the
'50s in terms of mentioning lamb-based dishes.</TE>

<HD>A Simple Soup: Plain Manila</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast Manila clams are small, tender clams that cook very
quickly. They work well in this simple low-calorie soup, made by
stirring miso into water and adding a little of the clam cooking
broth. Too much broth will overpower the miso, so be prudent.</LD>
<LD>   When cooking the clams, most of them will open as the water begins
to boil. Quickly remove them from the saucepan to prevent
overcooking, which results in tough clams. Throw away any that don't
open. (The reverse holds true for clams before cooking--if the shell
is already open and doesn't close when tapped, throw the clam away.
It's probably dead and could be contaminated.)</LD>
<LD>   You'll find the clams at fish markets. And pick up dashi, the
instant Japanese soup base, at Japanese and Asian markets, as well as
some well-stocked supermarkets.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miso Soup With Manila Clams</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   To make daikon curls, use a vegetable peeler to shave a daikon.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds Manila clams</TE>
<TE>   5 1/2 cups water, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon dashi (instant Japanese soup base)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons white miso</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon snipped chives</TE>
<TE>   Daikon curls, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Chives, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Scrub the clams under running water with a small brush to remove
any sand or dirt. Place the clams in a large saucepan and add 1 1/2
cups of the water. Cover the pot and heat over high heat until the
water is boiling and steam comes from the pot. Turn off the heat. At
this point the clams should be open. If they are not open, continue
to cook another minute or so until they open.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the clams from the broth. Strain the broth through a
cheesecloth and measure 1 cup for the soup. Use the remaining broth
for another recipe or freeze for future use.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the remaining 4 cups of water and the dashi in a saucepan
and heat to boiling. Stir in the reserved 1 cup of clam broth and
miso until blended.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the clams among 4 shallow serving bowls. Pour the broth
over them, dividing evenly. Sprinkle each serving with the snipped
chives.</TE>
<TE>   Garnish with a daikon curl and a few chives.</TE>

<HD>Santa Monica's Sunday-Morning Party</HD>

<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sunday Santa Monica farmers market is quite different from the
city's three other markets: It's largely a social and recreational
event, where families stroll and lounge on the lawn, listening to
music and waiting in line for crepes. The produce component is
strong, however, with a roster of good growers.</LD>
<LD>   It's not easy to find really flavorful tomatoes at this time of
year, but Sunday Gale Shacklett was selling fabulously sweet
Cherisita cherry tomatoes grown in greenhouses in Ridgecrest, in the
upper Mojave Desert, along with regular-size Blitz tomatoes, a Dutch
hybrid. Production is slow, she said, so she'll come only every other
week for the next month until a new crop matures.</LD>
<LD>   It's even rarer to find farmers market fish vendors who actually
catch what they sell. Cecilia Milman had cans of top-quality tuna and
salmon from fish hand-caught and handled with care by her husband,
Mike, on his boat, the Triggerfish. The personal touch shows in the
superior taste of all their offerings, including chunk, smoked and
packed with olive oil.</LD>
<TE>   In January Erich Kreidler, a German-born engineer, and two
partners bought most of the highly regarded Herbel Farm of De Luz;
Jerry and John Herbel now spend most of their time in Palm Springs.
At Sunday's market, Kreidler sold tasty organic Moro blood oranges
and excellent Fuerte avocados.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Guevara of Santa Maria offered nice sweet snow peas and sugar
snap peas, along with broccoli, cauliflower and green-leaf lettuce.
Nakamura Farm of Oxnard had baby spinach, arugula, leeks and large,
sweet gold beets.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jenks of Riverside displayed diverse herb plants, from
African Blue basil to chamomile; this Sunday he'll have 40 varieties
of tomato plants. His wife, Barbara, showed off impossibly cute
hand-fed Holland Lops rabbits, five to seven weeks old. At $50 each,
they're for pets, not eating; Bill said that they won't even sell
them on Easter weekend, to avoid impulsive purchasers.</TE>

<HD>A Subtle Interplay: Music and the Menu</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music might have universal appeal, but that doesn't mean that all
music is universally appealing. We've all had bad experiences in
restaurants, whether shouting at friends over jams played at
club-level volume or enduring Muzak so schlocky it conjures up
visions of the dental office. Conversely, music can make a good meal
better, often with the diner unaware of what's at work.</LD>
<LD>   Fred Eric, owner of the chic Silver Lake dinner restaurant Vida
and the 24-hour diner Fred 62, is arguably the king of Los Angeles
restaurant music. Eric burns his own CDs to play at specific times
during the night and gives them wacky names such as "Funk Smoker" and
"Kimba Meets Maggie" (his two cats). He says he has few rules when it
comes to choosing music for his restaurants. His approach might be
considered a thoughtful variation on "Anything Goes."</LD>
<LD>   "I don't like to restrict myself," he says, "since there's so much
stuff I like. I might go from Erik Satie to Brian Eno, then pull back
to Dolly Parton." Or he might toss in the H.R. Pufnstuf theme.</LD>
<TE>   The CDs are organized into three categories: early, which might
play from 6 to 8 p.m.; mid, 8 to 10 p.m.; and late, 10 p.m. until
closing. "Early is a little softer, more ethereal," says Eric. "Mid
picks up a bit. Late will really pick up. It's not like we'll be
playing hard techno, but we'll come close to it."</TE>
<TE>   There's no strict schedule, however. At 7 p.m. on a Thursday
night, a room full of high-energy 20-somethings might call for a CD
from the late category.</TE>
<TE>   He even welcomes sing-alongs (nothing engineered, just impromptu
outbursts to beloved tunes). But heavy bass is best avoided, Eric
says. "When you're dining, heavy bass is really disturbing. It ruins
digestion."</TE>
<TE>   David Meyers, the chef at Jaan at L'Ermitage Hotel in Beverly
Hills, also chooses his music very carefully. "I'm obsessed with the
entire experience of this restaurant," Meyers says. He favors
progressive groups such as Air and Buddha Bar, the "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon" soundtrack--and some music he mixes himself.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to create a meditative sense of energy," says
Meyers. "We choose music that makes people feel they're in a
different realm: still urban, a little London-chic. I don't want
people to focus on it, but if they happen to hear it, they find it
wonderful to listen to."</TE>
<TE>   Music can have a powerful effect. The beat alone, for example, can
determine whether guests have a leisurely or speedy meal. A
restaurant that wants to turn tables quickly will sometimes play
upbeat tunes. A speeded-up beat and pumped-up volume can also
energize a room.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I'll be in the dining room and the room will be full,
and if I feel things are too quiet, then I'll change the music and
you can see the room starting to become more alive," says Andy
Nakano, owner of Jozu, a sophisticated Cal-Asian restaurant in West
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Music seems easy enough to get right. Still, says Nakano, "the
last thing a lot of restaurateurs want to deal with is music. They're
focused on food, menu, wine and service. So music gets left on the
shelf."</TE>
<TE>   One popular option is a satellite system, something like radio
without commercials or DJs. DMX Music is probably the biggest name in
the field. It serves nearly 200,000 businesses in the U.S. (not all
are restaurants). Los Angeles clients include high-end places--Spago,
Eurochow--as well as casual spots such as Islands and Koo Koo Roo.</TE>
<TE>   DMX Music's most widely used system allows a restaurant to select
from about 100 music programs. Lite Classical, Latin Jazz, Golden
Oldies, Cajun, Hawaiian, Euro Hits and Retro Disco are among the
dizzying options. Businesses need not commit to one program; they can
shuffle among them at will. And at less than $100 a month, the system
is affordable.</TE>
<TE>   David Munyon, the general manager of Santa Monica's popular
Italian seafood trattoria I Cugini, likes the options DMX offers.
"We'll go with classic Italian, Italian instrumental and a lot of
different jazz," he says. "We change the music with the time of day
and the crowd. When we open in the morning, because we have a lot of
Latino workers, we'll play Spanish music. It gets people moving and
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, adds Munyon, the system doesn't require baby-sitting. "With
CDs," he says, "you get busy and the manager forgets to change them."
Another often-overlooked advantage of DMX and similar systems is that
artists' licensing fees are covered in the price.</TE>
<TE>   DMX Music isn't for everyone. Nakano used the system for more than
a year at Jozu. While some guests liked the music and told him so,
others did not. Their feelings, recorded on comment cards, ranged
from "this music is boring" to "get rid of this elevator music."</TE>
<TE>   Nakano, who now uses CDs, admits he was tired of the music too. "I
felt the variety wasn't enough," he says. "It wasn't eclectic enough.
It was kind of dated." He was also bothered by how quickly he was
able to identify DMX in other restaurants. "Right away you notice
it's DMX," he says. "It's the sequence they play the music."</TE>
<TE>   In general, restaurants rock out more on Friday and Saturday
nights, so diners looking for quiet conversation might go out earlier
in the week. As for those who must dine out on a Saturday, they'd
best go early, choose their destination carefully or prepare to
exercise those vocal cords.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some restaurants are in permanent concert mode. Chan
Dara, the casual Thai eatery in West Los Angeles, is among these. Its
patrons eat satay to the sounds of pounding American rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we get complaints," says co-owner Vavy Kittivech.
"[Customers] will ask you to turn the music down. We please the
customer. But then when they leave, we turn it back up. Our music is
kind of a trademark."</TE>

<LD>When one of our neighbors brought over a bag of tangerines, I juiced
some and made a citrus marinade. It turned out to be perfect for this
pork stir-fry.</LD>
<LD>   You can vary this dish in several ways. Substitute chicken for the
pork, if you prefer, using four boneless, skinless breasts or thighs.
And though this calls for snow peas and a bell pepper, you can add
your family's favorite vegetables. Finally, it's good over jasmine
rice, but for a switch try the pork over a bed of Asian noodles.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Tangerine-Marinated Pork With Stir-Fried Vegetables</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 cup tangerine juice (from about 4 tangerines)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lime juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 pound thin-cut boneless pork loin chops</TE>
<TE>   1 large red bell pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 cups snow peas, trimmed</TE>
<TE>   2 green onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup roasted cashews, optional</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Combine the tangerine juice, lime juice, 3 tablespoons of the soy
sauce and the garlic in a bowl. Cut the pork chops into
1/8-inch-thick strips and place in the marinade.</TE>
<TE>   While the pork is marinating, cut the red pepper in half and
remove the seeds. Slice the halves lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide
strips. (If it is a long pepper, cut each half in half crosswise,
then slice into 1/4-inch-wide strips.)</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or large nonstick skillet
over high heat until very hot. Drain the marinade from the pork and
reserve. Add small batches of the pork to the wok and cook, stirring,
until no longer pink and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove the
cooked pork to a bowl and continue cooking the rest of the pork.</TE>
<TE>   Remove all the pork, then add the remaining oil and the remaining
soy sauce to the wok. Add the red pepper, snow peas and green onions
and continue stirring on high heat until the vegetables are
crisp-tender, about 3 to 4 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Stir a little of the reserved marinade into the cornstarch until
smooth, then return to the rest of the marinade and add it to the
wok. It will begin to boil immediately. Let it boil for a full
minute, then add the cooked pork, cilantro and cashews, if using. Add
salt to taste. Stir to combine and heat through. Serve on jasmine
rice.</TE>

<HD>SAVORY-ING SWEETS</HD>
<DH>Great desserts need more than sugar. Would you believe
lavender, goat cheese, beer and black pepper?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA FLEMING with MELISSA CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Desserts are supposed to be sweet, but they need to be more than that
as well. Too often, though, you taste nothing but the sugar. One way
to overcome this is to incorporate some savory elements into your
dessert recipes.</LD>
<LD>   It's not really as odd as it sounds. After all, chefs on the
savory side of the kitchen often add fruit and other sweets (honey,
sugar, maple syrup) to a dish, especially meat and poultry. Foie gras
is frequently served with lightly candied or stewed fruits.</LD>
<LD>   But use a vegetable or some goat cheese in a dessert, and people
think you're nuts even though it makes perfect sense. If cherries are
good with duck, then why not put tomatoes in caramel?</LD>
<TE>   As a pastry chef, I love taking risks--making that leap of faith
with a dessert combination and hoping it makes as much sense to the
person eating it as it does to me. These experiments are explorations
in flavor. They're never done to be shocking or perverse. The only
time I think a dessert doesn't make sense is if it isn't delicious.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of what we think of as savory has an underlying sweetness to
it. For example, fennel tastes like licorice. Not only are tomatoes a
fruit botanically, I've had some ripe summer heirloom varieties that
are definitely as sweet as berries. Even bay leaves, when fresh, have
a suave, slightly spicy flavor that is terrific in cream-based
desserts. Fresh ones taste nothing like the dry bay leaves people
associate with beef stew.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond tasting good, using these elements in unexpected ways makes
people think differently about the nature of an ingredient. Why is
something as sweet as winter squash so infrequently used in dessert?
And if a hunk of triple-cream cheese has a smooth, luxurious texture
and a tart, milky taste, why not melt it into vanilla custard to add
richness and temper the sweetness? Or add a touch of mild goat cheese
to cheesecake to make it more complex?</TE>
<TE>   There's one key to using these ingredients in sweets: restraint.
It's not about hitting someone over the head with an unexpected
flavor, it's about balance and nuance. I like to think of savory
additions almost as if they were secret ingredients--they can add
that special something that takes an ordinary dessert and makes it
extraordinary. The flavors should be subtle enough reveal themselves
slowly. It might take several bites for a person to realize that
unusual flavor is a dollop of goat yogurt or a sprig of thyme.</TE>
<TE>   Herbs seem to adapt to desserts more easily than other savory
ingredients. Like the adage "what grows together goes together,"
summer fruit and fresh herbs are in season at the same time. To me,
tossing raspberries with verbena or lemon thyme makes as much sense
as pairing tomatoes and basil.</TE>
<TE>   Think of herbs as summer's counterpart to winter's earthy spices.
For example, basil reminds me of a fresh, lively version of cinnamon.
Just as peaches are spiced with cinnamon sticks to preserve them for
winter, in the height of summer I sometimes add a scoop of basil ice
cream to peach tarte Tatin.</TE>
<TE>   One savory ingredient I use in every season is salt. It serves the
same purpose in desserts that it does in savory food: bringing out
the flavors and nuances. It also helps temper the flavor of something
that is on the verge of cloying. My favorite use for salt in a sweet
is sprinkling coarse crystals of it on top of my chocolate caramel
tart. The salt highlights the sweetness within and makes the
chocolate flavor pop. If this seems strange, think of
chocolate-covered pretzels.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally I take my inspiration from a classic savory
combination and adapt it to dessert. In Italy, blood oranges and
fennel are mixed to make a refreshing winter salad. But in my
kitchen, that pairing becomes a blood orange sorbet served with
candied fennel.</TE>
<TE>   In the same vein, a typical savory Thai dish might include coconut
milk and cilantro--the vibrancy of the herb cutting through the
luscious richness of the coconut. I do the same thing in my coconut
tapioca dessert, drizzling cilantro syrup over the pearls in their
silky sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Something to keep in mind with this experimentation is that not
all savories are adaptable to desserts. Instinctively, I wouldn't try
making dessert from fish or meat. To do that would be to turn it into
the entree. After all, dessert should be whimsical and playful;
adding meat would make it nothing more than nourishment. And that's
what the rest of the meal is for.</TE>

<TE>   Goat-Cheese Cheesecake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Use the mildest goat cheese you can. Taste a few brands until you
find one with a suitably mild, light taste. Avoid an aged cheese,
which would be too strong and sharp for this recipe.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (11 ounces) cream cheese, room
temperature</TE>
<TE>   8 ounces fresh goat cheese, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, pulp scraped</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Wrap the outside of an 8-inch
springform pan with foil and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the cream cheese, goat cheese, sugar and vanilla pulp in
the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until smooth and creamy. Add
the mascarpone and beat until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Add the eggs and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl
with a rubber spatula as necessary. Strain the mixture into a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the mixture into the pan and place it in the center of a
larger baking pan. Pour enough very hot water into the baking pan to
reach two-thirds of the way up the side of the springform pan. Cover
the entire baking dish with foil. Pierce the foil in several places
with a knife. Bake the cake for 1 hour, then lift off a corner of the
foil to allow the steam to escape. Recover the pan and bake until the
cake looks rather wet and is still very slightly jiggly in the
center, but the edges are set, 40 to 45 minutes longer.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely before
serving. The cake can be made up to 2 days ahead and kept covered in
the refrigerator.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Black Pepper Ice Cream</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes
plus 4 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   This unusual ice cream works because the pepper cuts through the
richness of the cream, and its sharpness and slight heat give it a
lot of sophistication. It's a versatile ice cream that pairs
wonderfully with summer fruits such as berries and peaches.</TE>
<TE>   3 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   12 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   Combine the milk, cream and 1 cup of the sugar in a heavy
saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, whisk
together the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the milk mixture from the heat and add a little to the egg
yolk mixture to warm it, whisking constantly to keep the yolks from
curdling. Pour the yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture, whisking
the milk constantly as you pour.</TE>
<TE>   Return the custard to the stove and cook it over medium-low heat,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it thickens enough to
coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat and strain into a bowl. Stir in the crushed
peppercorns and the salt. Chill the custard until it's thoroughly
cold, at least 4 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Strain again and freeze in an ice cream maker according to the
manufacturer's instructions.</TE>

<TE>   Guinness Stout Ginger Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   In this recipe, stout is substituted for the water or coffee used
in most gingerbread recipes. Stout is a dark brown beer that is
heavier and sweeter than a porter, another dark beer. I find it adds
a lot of richness and underscores the spices. Since it is made with
oil, this cake will stay moist for several days. Dress it up or
simply enjoy it on its own, with coffee, tea or a beer!</TE>
<TE>   1 cup stout, preferably Guinness</TE>
<TE>   1 cup molasses</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan, line the
bottom and sides with parchment and grease the parchment.
(Alternatively, butter and flour a 6-cup bundt pan.)</TE>
<TE>   Combine the stout and molasses in a large saucepan over high heat
and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the baking soda. Allow
to sit until the foam dissipates.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs and the granulated and brown
sugars in a bowl. Whisk in the oil.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, ground ginger,
baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the stout mixture with the egg mixture, then whisk this
liquid into the flour mixture, half at a time. Add the grated ginger
and stir to combine.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake until the top springs
back when gently pressed, 1 hour. Do not open the oven until the
gingerbread is almost done or the center may fall slightly. Transfer
to a wire rack to cool.</TE>

<TE>   Lavender-Lemon Poundcake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   In this rich, buttery poundcake, the vibrancy of lemon accents and
tempers the musky floral qualities of lavender. The flavors harmonize
beautifully and make for a cake that manages to be at once plain and
simple, as poundcakes are, but also more interesting. Dried lavender
is available at gourmet markets and some farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup dried lavender, divided</TE>
<TE>   5 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons cake flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup strained lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9x5-inch loaf
pan.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter with 1 tablespoon of the lavender in a small
saucepan. Let the mixture steep 10 minutes, then strain, discarding
the lavender. Set aside to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar in the bowl of a mixer until
thick and pale, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sift together the flour and salt into a bowl. Using a whisk, fold
the lemon zest and one-third of the flour mixture into the eggs until
thoroughly combined. Fold in the rest of the flour in 2 batches. In a
separate bowl, whisk 1 cup of the batter with the melted butter and
the vanilla. Add this to the remaining batter and fold to combine.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out
clean, 40 to 45 minutes. If the top of the cake seems to be getting
overly browned before the center is set, cover with foil and continue
baking.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, the lemon
juice, 1/4 cup of water and the remaining 3 tablespoons of lavender
in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring,
until the sugar dissolves.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer the cake to a wire rack. Using a cake tester or skewer,
poke the cake all over. Brush the loaf with half of the syrup and let
cool for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto the rack, remove the pan
and brush the syrup over the bottom and sides of the cake. Turn the
cake back over and brush with the remaining syrup. Let cool
completely.</TE>

<LD>Since there is no such thing as cooking a little corned beef, I am
always left with a good-sized piece of meat after my St. Patrick's
Day dinner. But this Southern-flavored sauce--a blend of brown sugar,
spices and Bourbon--gives new life to the leftovers.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the corned beef and sauce with Southern-style cabbage made
by frying a few slices of bacon, then cooking thinly sliced cabbage
in the drippings along with some chicken broth and salt and pepper.
Crumble the bacon on top of the cabbage, add baked sweet potatoes and
corn muffins to the table and your second take on St. Patrick's Day
is delightfully complete.</LD>

<TE>   Corned Beef in Bourbon-Brown Sugar Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion</TE>
<TE>   1 pound corned beef</TE>
<TE>   1 large clove garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   Dash ground cloves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 cup beef broth</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Bourbon</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. Slice the onion in half lengthwise, then thinly
slice each half crosswise. Add the onion to the skillet, stirring
well to coat the slices with oil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook
until the onion is light gold, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, slice the corned beef against the grain on the diagonal
into 1/4-inch slices. Set aside. Mince the garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Add the garlic and the brown sugar to the onion, stirring well.
Cook until the brown sugar is bubbly and the onion is coated with the
mixture, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the cloves,
allspice and mustard. Add the beef broth and stir well. Carefully
place the corned beef slices in the skillet. Bring the sauce to a
simmer and cook until the mixture thickens and is almost syrupy,
about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning the slices over
once.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the orange juice
concentrate and the Bourbon. Return the pan to the heat just long
enough to warm the Bourbon, about 1 minute. Do not boil. Divide the
corned beef among serving plates and spoon the onion and sauce over
the top.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: My mother-in-law lost a lamb shank recipe she got from The
Times. I searched the archives but could not find it. It would mean a
great deal to her if we could obtain the recipe. Thank you.</LD>
<LD>   ROCHELLE JOHNSON</LD>
<LD>   Via e-mail</LD>
<TE>   DEAR ROCHELLE: Here's one recipe we've run. I hope it's the right
one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamb Shank Carbonnade</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours 25
minutes</TE>
<TE>   Ask your butcher to split the lamb shank for easier cooking. If
desired, buy 2 small lamb shanks (it isn't necessary to increase the
amount of liquid).</TE>
<TE>   LAMB</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 (1 1/2-pound) lamb shank</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 large clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon crushed dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups beef broth</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup full-bodied, slightly sweet beer, preferably German</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large, deep skillet over
medium-high heat. Dust the lamb shank with the flour (reserve any
remaining flour) and brown on all sides, about 7 minutes. Remove the
lamb from the skillet, reduce the heat to medium and add the
remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and cook until tender and
lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, brown sugar,
vinegar, bay leaf and thyme. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Add any
remaining flour.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually add the broth and beer to the mixture and bring to a
boil. Scrape up any browned bits. Reduce the heat to low and return
the lamb to the skillet. Cover and cook over low heat until the meat
is tender, about 2 hours. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Remove the bay leaf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MINTED COUSCOUS</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup couscous</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh mint leaves</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground white pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the
garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil.
Stir in the couscous and cover the pan. Turn off the heat and set the
couscous aside until the broth is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add the
mint. Season to taste with the salt and white pepper. Fluff up the
couscous with a fork.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the couscous into a serving dish. Top with the lamb and
skillet juices. Carve the lamb at the table. Serve hot.</TE>

<HD>I'm Nikki, Your Sushi Girl</HD>
<DH>Everybody got a drink? Everybody got a knife? It's time for
this sushi class to get slicing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten friends stand on either side of a narrow table cluttered with
avocados, cucumbers, knives, cutting boards, soft drinks and apple
martinis. They're waiting for orders from a young woman who is clad
all in black except for her footwear--the Japanese wooden clogs
called gaeta.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody have a drink? Everybody have a knife?" It's time for
Sushi Girl, a.k.a. Nikki Gilbert.</LD>
<LD>   During the next two hours, Gilbert will show the party in West Los
Angeles how to make cucumber and California rolls, how to wrap rice,
spicy tuna and daikon sprouts in a cone of seaweed and how to slice
fish, then mold it to rice for classic nigiri sushi.</LD>
<TE>   It's serious business, but it involves a lot of laughter and winds
up with a last course never found in a sushi bar--chocolate fondue,
cake and Rice Krispie treats. Not just a class, this is a party for a
group of women who get together regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert specializes in teaching such groups. She charges $55 per
person, with a minimum of 10 students. Sometimes students share the
fee. On other occasions a host sponsors the party. Gilbert shops for
fish, seaweed sheets, wasabi and other essentials and prepares the
rice, which is medium-grain Calrose seasoned with a Japanese-style
rice vinegar formulated for sushi. Guests have only to bring a knife
and a cutting board.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders how a Greek-German-Polish-Jewish fan of hamburgers and
chocolate cake turned into Sushi Girl. Born and raised in Venice,
Gilbert, 30, has eaten Asian food since the age of 6. While in high
school, she worked as a waitress in a Westside Japanese restaurant,
then in a sushi bar while attending UC Berkeley, where she was an
ethnic studies major. She asked the sushi chefs there for lessons.
"I'd go home and bring in what I made, and they would laugh at me,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   After college, Gilbert taught elementary school in Kitakyushu,
Japan, for three years. She became such a regular at a yakitori bar
there that she sometimes got behind the counter to serve drinks. Back
home, she studied at the California Sushi Academy in Venice, tried
catering and taught at the Learning Annex and Epicurean cooking
school.</TE>
<TE>   Like Superman, Sushi Girl is an identity that emerges only in
times of need. Weekdays, Gilbert works full time for investment
advisors in Mar Vista.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody know the definition of sushi?" she asks the class. The
answer is vinegared rice, not raw fish. "'Su' is vinegar. 'Shi' is
rice. Cut-up fish is just sashimi," Gilbert explains.</TE>
<TE>   Now the women cut cucumbers into neat sticks to line on rice
pressed onto a sheet of nori. They will roll this with the aid of a
bamboo mat, called a sudare, which they have covered with plastic
wrap to protect it from sticky rice grains. "The biggest problem with
sushi is the rice. It makes such a mess," Gilbert says. She shows how
to dip your hands in water, then clap them to remove the excess
before handling rice.</TE>
<TE>   A mashed rice grain later will serve as a seal for seaweed-wrapped
tuna hand rolls. "You're sure to have one somewhere on your body,"
she says. And one student exhibits hands coated with rice because she
forgot to dip them in water.</TE>
<TE>   Using three cuts as Gilbert directs, the students turn each long
cucumber roll into individual sushi. Some are a little lumpy. The
filling oozes out of others. "There's no such thing as mistakes, it's
just dinner," Gilbert consoles them.</TE>
<TE>   One woman dips a piece into a saucer of soy sauce seasoned with
wasabi. "You know what? This is good," she says. Another packs what
she has made to take home to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The ice broken, they proceed to California rolls, filled with
avocado, cucumber and crab sticks. The outer layer is rice, embedded
with flying fish roe. The roe should have been sesame seeds, but
Gilbert has left the seeds at home. "What, no goma?" laments a
participant.</TE>
<TE>   After this, spicy tuna hand rolls seem easy. The tuna isn't too
spicy, Gilbert reassures those who hesitate. She has seasoned it with
mayonnaise mixed with Tabasco and a Vietnamese hot sauce. This style
of sushi is called temaki. ("Maki" is roll. "Te" is hand.)</TE>
<TE>   Then it's on to nigiri sushi--a mound of rice topped with raw
fish, in this case Japanese snapper. "Your only real goal is that it
stands up when you put it down," Gilbert says. The way to eat nigiri
sushi is to pick it up by hand, then lightly dip the fish side, not
the rice, in soy sauce, she explains.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert walks around the table to give individual pointers. "This
isn't as hard as you guys thought it would be. It tastes like sushi,
yeah?" There's vigorous applause as the class ends.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert heads for the dessert table and dips a banana chunk in a
pot of melted chocolate. It's the first thing she has eaten that
evening. The class asks why she has passed on the sushi. "It's like
when you bake cookies all day," she says. "You don't want to eat
them."</TE>

by the blue noren (curtains) fluttering outside. The delicate little
cakes on display inside include four that are used in the Japanese
tea ceremony. They are kaki (persimmon), which is tinted orange to
resemble the fruit; botan (peony), a white cake with a pink blush;
kiku (chrysanthemum), which is pink; and yuki (snowflake), a white
cake with the image of a snowflake pressed into the top. All are made
of rice flour dough stuffed with sweetened bean paste. The dark paste
is made with red beans and the white paste with limas.</LD>

<HD>A Cake Cookbook Strictly for Inspiration</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Cakes are like clothing. You can have a good buttery pound cake that
is as simple and everyday as an old pair of blue jeans. But sometimes
a baked good just needs to feel pretty. For those special occasions
there are decorated cakes. And when it comes to the latter,
apparently there is no such thing as too much.</LD>
<LD>   The Gianni Versace of the baking world is Margaret Braun, owner of
a Manhattan shop and creator of some of the most gloriously
over-the-top cakes you can imagine. A Margaret Braun cake is not so
much something to eat as an art object. It resembles its more
earthbound cousins in the same way that a Louis XIV escritoire
resembles a desk from Sears. Now Braun has written a cookbook,
"Cakewalk" (Rizzoli, $50). Think of it as the anti-"Cake Mix Doctor."</LD>
<LD>   Books such as this one need to be approached on their own terms.
Belittling this as the least cook-able cookbook of the year would be
like criticizing haute couture fashion for not keeping you
sufficiently warm. "Cakewalk" is one of those special books that
exists outside the parameters of normal cookbookery. It pays barely a
nod to the mainstream; there are only a dozen or so recipes--or, more
accurately, things that resemble recipes--and they are stuck in the
back, kind of like maids in the pantry.</LD>
<TE>   And that is as it should be. "Cakewalk" is not there so much to
cook from as to be inspired by. Braun's cakes, photographed by
Quentin Bacon as if they were modern sculptures, are astonishing to
behold. Out of such plain stuff as royal icing, marzipan and butter
cream, she fashions drapes and swags, brightly colored fruits and
endless strings of pearls. Cakes are decorated to resemble Meissen
porcelain, Greek mosaics and the fruit-constructed paintings of
Arcimboldo. There's even an "Homage to Linoleum."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of artistry exists on a separate plane from everyday
reality. These are fever dreams of cakes, fits of inspiration. To try
to replicate them at home would be pointless. Indeed, it even would
be a little demeaning--as if the only thing keeping a normal person
from making cakes like these is one scant page of instructions</TE>
<TE>   The very idea of taking this thing into the kitchen is enough to
make a normal person shudder. But then a normal person would never
attempt to make such things. And wouldn't the world be a poorer place
for that?</TE>

<HD>Sangiovese, a Tuscan Homie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My vote for the most agreeable all-around table wine grape generally
goes to Sangiovese, especially as expressed in the top three wines of
Tuscany: Chianti Classico, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Brunello
di Montalcino. Not only do they go with all kinds of food, they make
all kinds of food taste better.</LD>
<LD>   The initial appeal of Tuscan wines is largely in juicy fruit with
bright acidity, succulent berry flavors that have a distinctive note
of dried sour cherries and a slightly raspy, palate-cleansing
texture. But there's more to it than that. Beyond their sunny Italian
charm, the best wines of Tuscany demonstrate the capacity of
Sangiovese, Italy's most widely-planted red grape, to express a
dazzling array of nuances depending on where it's grown. Sangiovese
is one of the world's great terroir-talking wines.</LD>
<LD>   That makes the annual tasting of new vintages in Tuscany an
especially exciting event. In the last few years, it's been even more
so, because vintages in the late 1990s were very, very good to
Sangiovese.</LD>
<TE>   They were good for Merlot, too. And believe it or not, that's
increasingly important in Tuscany, now that producers in Chianti
Classico and Montepulciano are allowed to include nonnative grapes
such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in their blends.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, most producers have remained staunchly committed
to Sangiovese and the other Tuscan homies, Canaiolo and Colorino. But
the ranks have been swaying lately in the direction of prospective
profits from an expanding global wine market that wants nothing more
than rich wines with forward fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Chianti currently exports two-thirds of its annual production,
which means fierce competition from fruity Californian, Chilean and
Australian renditions of international varietals. Montepulciano's
rapidly expanding production is also increasingly aimed at export. So
more and more producers in both areas are succumbing to the charms of
international varieties such as Merlot in their blends--but not
always with an easy conscience.</TE>
<TE>   Thus an air of controversy surrounded this year's spring tastings
in Tuscany. Even as the newly released wines were being presented,
producers were debating their character and authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Should Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot become part of Tuscan wine
character? Should modern techniques such as irrigation, with the
higher yields and blurring of vintage distinctions that are among the
likely results, be allowed? Are regional character and globalization
necessarily opposed? Those were among the issues raised at a
conference hosted by the Chianti Classico Consortium in Sienna.</TE>
<TE>   The progressive view in this heated debate was championed by
Angelo Gaja, who is known as a modernist in his native Barbaresco and
has recently begun producing wines in Tuscany's Montalcino and
seaside Maremma districts. "Why should vines stay in one place?" he
asked passionately. "Why should Cabernet Sauvignon stay in Bordeaux?
We have a wealth of geographical conditions in Italy, which gives us
the opportunity to produce wines of character and quality from many
different grapes--our native varieties, blends of native and
international varieties, and the international varieties alone."</TE>
<TE>   Gaja was expressing a popular viewpoint in Tuscany. Why be limited
to the so-called authentic varieties when the region offers superb
locations for international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot and Chardonnay?</TE>
<TE>   Traditionalists argue that the region can be modern without losing
its regional character, which derives largely from the Sangiovese
grape. In fact, they say, tying their image to native grapes and
terroir is increasingly necessary as international wines become more
homogeneous.</TE>
<TE>   Riccardo Ricci Curbastro, enologist at his family's Capriolo
estate in Franciacorta (Lombardy), insisted on the importance of
maintaining distinctive regional character. "We can only compete in
quality linked to terroir," he said. "The ancient Romans already
loved to classify wines according to the production site. They knew
wines from different areas had different characteristics. Thanks to
this rich historical past, we have one of the richest plant banks in
the world. Every Italian village has different wines, different
beans, different agricultural products."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was California winemaker Paul Draper of Ridge
Vineyards who spoke most eloquently on behalf of tradition. Pointing
out the danger inherent in the leveling effect of industrial
winemaking and mass marketing on wine quality, he said, "Diversity,
distinctiveness and the highest quality are sacrificed as the
connection to terroir and the natural process is lost. Wine has been
the central symbol for transformation in the Western world from the
dawn of civilization. For many people living in the modern world of
glass, concrete, and conditioned air, it is consciously or
unconsciously a connection to the earth and the seasons, to nature.
As wine becomes just another industrial product, we risk losing that
vital connection."</TE>
<TE>   There was no debate about the general quality of the wines
currently on the table. The recent Sangiovese-based wines of Chianti
Classico, Montepulciano and Montalcino are, collectively, the best
ever. They reflect not only the excellent 1997-2000 growing seasons
in west-central Italy but an evolution that has been in progress
since the introduction of quality-oriented wine production laws in
1966.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the evolution has been a straightforward, if extremely
challenging, upgrading of vineyards and wineries to bring them into
the front rank of the world's top wine-producing regions. Every
aspect of Tuscan wine, from clones and rootstocks to fermentation and
aging technology, has been scrutinized. Every aspect of production
has been upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, one of the oldest wine regions on the planet has
reinvented itself in the dawn of the 21st century. As panelist
Curbastro pointed out, "Yes, Sangiovese could be considered a local
variety. But it has become interesting on a worldwide level, so it's
an international variety too."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the most important part of evolution is just getting
started. All the significant practical matters have been addressed.
Now, it's time to debate the philosophy and metaphysics of wine, an
activity in which the Italian soul rejoices.</TE>
<TE>   As Gaja noted, "The state of confusion that reigns in Italy at the
moment is not terribly negative. Italians manage to find pearls in
confusion."</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, hope that the Tuscan pearls continue to be dark red
and hang in tight little bunches on Sangiovese vines.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Interesting bottles keep turning up from Spain. This one isn't from
well-known Rioja, Ribera del Duero or Penedes but from Toro in
Castile-Leon. Made entirely from tinto de Toro, a local relative of
Rioja's Tempranillo grape, and aged in French and American oak, it's
an austere, focused red fleshed out with ripe fruit and tannins. It
seems to hold in its taste some of the stony soil and heat of north
central Spain. Like so many Mediterranean wines, it's made for food.
It goes beautifully with meat, especially lamb, and duck too. And
this dry, full-bodied wine is powerful enough to stand up to anything
cooked on the barbecue.</LD>
<LD>   About $26. Available at Wine House, (310) 479-3731 in West Los
Angeles; Woodland Hills Wine Co., (818) 222-1111 in Woodland Hills;
and Wine Exchange, (714) 974-1454 in Orange. If you can't find this
wine, have your local store contact the distributor, Associated Wine
Distributors, (707) 963-8055.</LD>

<HD>ABC Woos Jilted News Division</HD>
<DH>Media: Staffers are said to be demoralized, but Wall Street
is unfazed by network's failed gamble to lure Letterman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN, SALLIE HOFMEISTER and CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spurned by late-night host David Letterman, ABC on Tuesday began the
process of damage control, starting with its demoralized news
staffers.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner called
"Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel. The veteran newsman would have been
bumped from the time slot he has held for two decades if Letterman
had jumped from CBS to ABC, which is owned by Disney.</LD>
<LD>   A person familiar with the Tuesday morning conversation called it
"warm and friendly." Koppel declined to comment, but Monday urged
Disney to send a "clear and unmistakable signal ... that 'Nightline'
can count on serious corporate backing."</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, ABC News President David Westin tried to rally the
troops in a phone call, saying he would make sure the corporation has
a full understanding of the value of ABC News, according to network
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Westin also asked his staff to avoid feeling beaten down by the
events and use them as a challenge to take a close look at all ABC
News programming and make sure it is as "competitive and innovative
and bold" as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a chastisement, but the sense that we can't rest on our
laurels here," said one news-division source.</TE>
<TE>   Westin also said he hoped the division would be able to produce
more prime-time specials for the network such as Monday's program on
Osama bin Laden, which drew respectable ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was one of pure economics, according to ABC officials.
Although "Nightline" is profitable, it does not pull in the ad
revenues of the big two entertainment talk shows: "The Tonight Show
With Jay Leno" on General Electric Co.'s NBC, and "Late Night With
David Letterman" on Viacom Inc.'s CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, our mission is to make the network as strong
as it can be," said Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for ABC. "Our strategy
is to look to improve our overall performance."</TE>
<TE>   The residue of bad feelings extends beyond the news staff. Some
affiliates Tuesday said they too were disappointed with Disney's
handling of the Letterman affair.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with ABC trying to better themselves in late
night," said Alan Bell, president of Freedom Broadcasting, which owns
five CBS and three ABC station affiliates. "What I fault them for is
their failure to anticipate the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Their chances of getting Letterman were never great, and now they
have a bunch of demoralized people in news. They have to sell
advertising in a show that they've damaged. Their immediate task is
to reassure advertisers, affiliates and the news department that it
was all worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Another TV executive said Disney had boxed itself in, having to
renew its commitment to "Nightline" even though the ratings have been
slipping steadily.</TE>
<TE>   "Fixing this is like asking someone to jump and not land," said
Stephen Unger, managing partner of media and entertainment at
executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no easy solution to this," Unger said. "Disney took a
gamble and lost. What's needed now is more than just eating crow.
Management has to make specific financial and marketing commitments
to 'Nightline' to demonstrate their support of the show, the absence
of which will be an invitation for Mr. Koppel and crew to move on."</TE>
<TE>   "This was severely undermining not only to ABC but to the other
parts of Disney," he said, calling the environment "very shaky now."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street, meanwhile, seemed unfazed by the news that Letterman
was remaining at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody raised or lowered their earnings estimates [for Disney] in
anticipation of Letterman happening, and no one on Wall Street is
crying because it didn't happen," said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst at
Gerard Klauer Mattison.</TE>
<TE>   Bruised egos aside, Logsdon suggested that big-talent deals
negotiated in secret at the top levels of major media companies are
not unusual and not confined to entertainment. "You have Fox going
around Dodger management" when it comes to talk of trading players,
Logsdon said.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic reality is that this is a world driven by profits, "
Logsdon said. Although Letterman would have been "a nice acquisition,
on a dollars-and-cents basis Disney is no worse off today than they
were three weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   The problems ABC faces stem from a variety of factors and won't be
easily fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The success of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" briefly masked a
shortage of new hits at the network, and ABC officials have stressed
that it will take only one or two shows to provide the makings of a
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   That said, launching those shows won't be easy, especially with
the smaller audiences the network is attracting. Last week, for
example, ABC averaged 7.7 million viewers in prime time--down 36%
versus the corresponding period in 2001, and 4.6 million viewers
behind second-place NBC.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, ABC is down more than 20% among adults age 18 to
49, a key demographic.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares Tuesday fell 21 cents to $23.71 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Plan to Add Flights to Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The skies over Southern California are about to get considerably more
crowded.</LD>
<LD>   Several airlines plan to add service to Los Angeles and other
cities in the region as they cautiously gear up for the busy summer
travel season. Some carriers are resuming flights canceled after
Sept. 11, while others are adding new service to grab market share
from rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The moves illustrate how airline travel continues to gradually
recover from the effect of the terrorist attacks, bolstered largely
by the carriers' constant fare sales for travelers who can book in
advance. But passenger traffic remains well below year-ago levels,
with business travel particularly weak.</LD>
<TE>   The number of domestic passengers is expected to drop to 600
million in the year ending Sept. 30 compared with a record 695
million set two years earlier, the Federal Aviation Administration
said in its annual forecast released Tuesday. Air travel won't start
growing again until next year, it added.</TE>
<TE>   "There continues to be month-over-month improvement," said Paul
Haney, a spokesman for Los Angeles International Airport. "However,
going into the spring we're still down about 15% [in passenger
traffic] from a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Also, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said Tuesday its operations will
remain 16% to 17% below year-earlier levels, even though it's adding
dozens of additional flights out of its Chicago hub in June.</TE>
<TE>   The increase will double LAX-Chicago flights to 16 a day from
eight, returning the carrier to the same number of flights it had
before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   United also is extending a fare sale aimed at luring more business
travelers--a promotion originally set to end this month--until Sept.
30.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, low-fare king Southwest Airlines took aim at United and
American by saying last week that it will launch service from LAX to
Chicago's Midway Airport on May 5, with three daily nonstop flights.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest had avoided locking horns with United and American on
that route. But Dallas-based Southwest--the only airline that didn't
cut its operations after Sept. 11--is launching the service because
it's getting additional airplanes and saw LAX-Chicago as one of the
"routes that are underserved and overpriced," said Southwest
spokeswoman Brandy King.</TE>
<TE>   United's Bowers said Southwest's action wasn't a factor in
United's decision to restore hourly LAX-Chicago service, though he
said "they keep everybody very much on their toes."</TE>
<TE>   Southwest also is adding four daily flights between John Wayne
Airport and Sacramento, starting April 7.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, daily flights at the Orange County airport are holding at
258--a dozen less than the 270 being logged daily before Sept. 11,
said spokeswoman Ann McCarley.</TE>
<TE>   American on Monday also announced plans to add nine daily
round-trip flights from LAX to various cities, including three
additional LAX-Chicago flights starting April 7. That will give
American a total of 14 daily flights on that route.</TE>
<TE>   America West Airlines said it's adding 46 daily flights to 31
markets from its Phoenix home over the next four months, with about
half of the flights representing new service. The additions include
more flights to LAX, Orange County and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue Airways, a small carrier based in New York, is launching
twice-daily service from Long Beach to Dulles International Airport
in Washington on May 1, with sale fares as low as $104 one-way if
purchased by March 29.</TE>

<DH>A proposal for the site of Ambassador College in Pasadena
raises citizens' ire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A massive housing project proposed for the Ambassador College site in
Pasadena--perhaps the largest ever considered in the city--also is
shaping up as Pasadena's most divisive development imbroglio.</LD>
<LD>   Two well-organized local groups have drawn a line in the roses
over a proposal by Legacy Partners, a Foster City, Calif.-based real
estate developer, to build 1,727 housing units on the 48-acre campus
southwest of the Old Pasadena shopping district.</LD>
<LD>   The intensifying debate over the Ambassador site occurs at a time
when Pasadena residents are struggling with the growing urbanization
of their once-quiet city. The success of Old Pasadena and the opening
of the Paseo Colorado mall have flooded West Pasadena streets with
traffic, and developers plan to build an additional 1,500 housing
units in the city's downtown.</LD>
<TE>   The strategic battle over the future of the Ambassador College
site is a snapshot of growth control, circa 2002. Neighborhood groups
have become more sophisticated about the esoteric rules of city
planning. And both the developer and its opponents seem to be playing
the controversy like a game of chess, anticipating each other's
moves.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents claim that the proposed housing more than doubles the
existing density found in surrounding neighborhoods. They also claim
that the project does not respect the city's planning policy on
either traffic control or urban design. Some opponents hint they will
file lawsuits if the developers do not scale back.</TE>
<TE>   To support their statements, the 600-member West Pasadena
Residents Assn. has issued a series of white papers studded with
planning details. They have hired an independent consultant to
challenge the conclusions of the developer's traffic plan. And the
group has proposed a development alternative it claims will satisfy
the developer's basic financial needs while taking pressure off the
neighborhoods west of the Ambassador campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in the litigation business," said Vince Farhat,
president of the homeowners' group. "We are working with the city to
be strong advocates [for the neighborhood] and to make the project
better."</TE>
<TE>   The property owner, the Worldwide Church of God, and the
developer, Legacy Partners, have opened by offering to preserve many
of the site's historic homes and gardens, as well as the nine-acre
"great lawn" at the center of the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The developer also announced a complex plan to finance the
re-opening of the long-shuttered Ambassador Auditorium, considered by
many to be the finest concert hall in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The church has issued a warning, which opponents view as a veiled
threat: If the City Council fails to approve the project, the church
will sell the property piecemeal to developers, resulting in
potentially greater densities than those outlined by Legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1947, the Worldwide Church of God assembled the
Ambassador campus from 138 properties, including several stately
houses along Orange Grove Boulevard that had become dilapidated.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s and '70s, the church built a number of college
buildings, industrial facilities and the concert hall, while filling
in several streets to create two large campuses on either side of the
710 Freeway spur.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in the late 1980s, Ambassador College had 1,200
students, and the church and college together had 1,000 employees. In
the mid-1990s, however, the Worldwide Church of God experienced a
schism brought on by doctrinal changes, and the church lost much of
its membership. Ambassador College closed in 1995 as revenue fell.</TE>
<TE>   "We have only 15% of the money that we generated at our height in
1989," said Bernard W. Schnippert, the church's director of finance
and planning.</TE>
<TE>   The Worldwide Church of God spends about $12 million annually to
maintain its large complex of buildings and elaborate gardens. "Some
people expect this push and pull and tug to last for another five
years, but that is false," said Schnippert. "We can't sustain it."</TE>
<TE>   After considering two other development concepts for the site--one
for a hotel and conference center with housing, and the other for a
1-million-square-foot building for dot-com incubator Idealab--the
developer settled on a residential plan. Some of the tallest and
densest buildings will be on St. John Avenue, next to the
72-foot-tall Ambassador Auditorium. The developer plans a mix of
single-family houses, town homes, condominiums and apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The church plans to sell the property to Legacy for an undisclosed
amount, after the developer gets the go-ahead from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Schnippert said the price is set and would not be affected by how
much, or how little, could be built on the Ambassador site, but
hinted that without a certain number of homes the developer could not
afford to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Although the project does increase existing densities, those
densities fall within the limits set by the West Gateway Specific
Plan, the planning document approved by Pasadena City Council in May
2000. That document allows densities of as many as 14 dwelling units
per acre along Orange Grove, and increases the density to 48 units
along St. John Avenue. The highest density is allowed on the east
campus, with 60 units per acre.</TE>
<TE>   "The density will bring a hell of a lot more traffic," said Gordon
Odell, president of a group called Save South Orange Grove, who
presented the Pasadena City Council with a petition signed by 1,100
residents protesting the project. He added, "We think [Orange Grove]
is extremely threatened." He has hinted the group may sue if it
remains dissatisfied with the project.</TE>
<TE>   Farhat of the West Pasadena group blames the West Gateway plan for
making the church believe the property is a gold mine. "Where the
process went wrong," he said, "is that the density allowances in the
specific plan gave rise to unrealistic expectations of value."</TE>
<TE>   According to Farhat, the church is marketing the property at a
"much higher price" than it would otherwise command, in the belief
that the Ambassador property can support high-density development.</TE>
<TE>   William Shubin, a Legacy senior vice president, told a crowd of
more than 500 residents at the Pasadena Hilton last week that the
density of the project is not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Many existing residential and commercial properties in the
Ambassador area are more dense than what Legacy is proposing, Shubin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the design guidelines "contain more restrictions"
than required by the city's zoning laws, Shubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Farhat said he supports development on the east side of the
Ambassador campus--the side closest to Old Pasadena and commuter rail
connections and farthest from the homes and apartments along Orange
Grove. "The win-win scenario is to move forward with the east
campus," he said. "Let the church make some money, rather than have
the church spend the next 20 years fighting us."</TE>
<TE>   If the church is forced to sell the property piecemeal, the number
of homes on the Ambassador Campus eventually could approach 2,400,
Schnippert said.</TE>
<TE>   The church official acknowledged, however, that that high number
could be achieved only by demolishing the Ambassador Auditorium and
all historic structures and gardens--something he said the church
does not want to do. "It's not that we're trying to make threats,"
Schnippert said. "It's more like a plea."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, the church awaits recommendations from the
city's Transportation Advisory Commission next month and the Planning
Commission in May. The certification of the developer's final
Environmental Impact Report, which could trigger lawsuits if
opponents remain dissatisfied, is set for June.</TE>
<TE>   To help the city negotiate design issues with the developer,
Pasadena hired Los Angeles-based architect John Kaliski. His goal, he
said, is to "define the character of Pasadena, which, in turn will
help us create a set of design guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Kaliski said development on the west side of campus adjoining
Orange Grove should reflect Pasadena's City of Gardens ordinance.
That law calls for the harmonious integration of architecture and
landscape, courtyard housing, uniform setbacks to preserve "view
corridors" and preservation of human scale.</TE>
<TE>   The architect said he is optimistic that some accord can be
reached between the quarreling developer and local residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The church, the developer and the residents actually all have the
same goal," Kaliski said. "They just don't necessarily all interpret
the end result the same way." The task at hand, he added, is: "Can we
really get the design to match everybody's words--because the words
are very similar."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Closer to Deal With SEC</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Firm, losing clients and key staff, wants to
resolve probe quickly and could set up a restitution fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm is in settlement talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that could lead to establishment
of a restitution fund for Enron Corp. shareholders, people familiar
with the discussions said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations are aimed at resolving the civil probe of the
company. At the same time, Andersen is continuing to meet with the
Justice Department to settle a possible obstruction-of-justice
charge, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen has admitted destroying documents sought by federal
investigators from Andersen's audit of Enron.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen's strategy is to settle its civil and criminal issues
quickly so that it can stay in business, either as an independent
firm or until it can arrange a merger or other deal with one of its
larger rivals. Andersen has talked to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and
Ernst &amp; Young about a business combination, according to sources
familiar with the talks. Andersen also is in talks with accounting
firm KPMG, the New York Times reported.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the second major settlement between the SEC and
Andersen, which last year paid a $7-million SEC fine over its audit
for Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But an individual with knowledge of the talks said the SEC
probably would not levy a large fine against the accounting firm,
fearing that it would eat into restitution funds available to Enron
shareholders. Those shareholders lost billions of dollars in the
company's collapse and have filed a class-action lawsuit against
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government agency is not in the business of
collecting money for shareholders, the circumstances of the Enron
meltdown and Andersen's involvement in the case are so extraordinary
that the SEC has decided on this approach, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the federal agencies and Andersen declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   With each new development, however, attorneys involved in the
lawsuit against Andersen say the outlook for the firm gets grimmer.</TE>
<TE>   "These are extremely delicate discussions, and there is a big
question mark as to whether Andersen will be able to navigate a way
through the various civil and criminal hurdles," said Vincent R.
Cappucci, a New York attorney who represents several public pension
funds in the class-action case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that bankruptcy seems to be the most likely scenario for
the firm, and that is unfortunate because it means there will be less
money available for a settlement," Cappucci said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is believed to have an insurance fund of up to $250
million. In previous talks, Andersen had discussed paying as much as
$750 million to settle Enron claims.</TE>
<TE>   However, payments were to be made into a fund over several years,
allowing the accounting firm to use its earnings power in the future
to help close the case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the defections of major clients continue. On Tuesday,
oil and gas concern Kerr-McGee Corp. switched to Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about $120million in revenue since Enron's Dec.
2 bankruptcy filing and is expected to have more client defections
over the next six weeks, when most large firms determine their
auditors for the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also is starting to lose key staff. Lynn Turner, the
former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission
and an accounting expert at Colorado State University, said one of
the other top accounting firms in the United States has been
approached by 200 Andersen partners looking to switch firms.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just not a lot of hard assets at Andersen that would be
available for a settlement," Cappucci said. "The staff leaves, the
clients follow and soon there's nothing left. We don't have much hope
for Andersen as a business entity."</TE>
<TE>   The University of California Board of Regents, the lead plaintiff
in the lawsuit, is watching the developments  carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "Without seeing details of the deals, it would be hard to know how
it would affect our litigation," said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the
regents.</TE>
<TE>   However, Davis said the UC system would object to any settlement
that "does not allow the victims appropriate restitution."</TE>

<HD>Calpine Secures Bank Credit, Cuts Spending</HD>
<DH>Energy: Company defers or cancels $3billion in orders for
turbines, trims profit forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., a builder and operator of power plants, delayed or
canceled $3 billion of turbine purchases and obtained $1.6 billion in
bank credit to shore up its finances.</LD>
<LD>   Cancellation penalties and unrefunded deposits on 35 General
Electric Co. turbines will reduce profit by $98 million this quarter,
Chief Executive Peter Cartwright said. Calpine also deferred delivery
and payment on 81 more turbines from General Electric, Siemens and
Toshiba Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Energy firms are delaying projects or selling assets to raise cash
and bolster their balance sheets after the collapse of Enron Corp.
eroded investor confidence in the industry. Calpine in January
postponed $2 billion of projects to avoid a cash crunch. Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's rate Calpine debt as junk.</LD>
<TE>   "They've plugged a leak in their liquidity, but they've just
raised a lot of money and are putting up a lot of collateral to build
plants above market value," said Commerzbank Capital Markets analyst
Andre Meade, who rates Calpine "hold" and doesn't own its shares.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating agency Fitch Inc. lowered Calpine debt to BB from
BB-plus because Calpine used U.S. and Canadian natural-gas reserves,
its U.K. Saltend power plant and its equity investment in nine U.S.
plants to secure the new financing. The rating is two levels below
investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's put Calpine on watch for a possible downgrade,
saying "the additional debt will likely increase interest expense,
refinancing risk and interest-rate risk, and limit financial
flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Jose-based Calpine fell $1.06 to $11.68 on the New
York Stock Exchange. They have tumbled 75% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's 8.5% coupon notes maturing in 2011 fell to 77 cents on
the dollar from 79 cents Monday, traders said. That pushed the yield
on the debt up to 12.9% from 12.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's BB-plus rating of Calpine and Moody's Ba1
ranking are a notch below investment grade. Moody's had Calpine's
credit as investment grade for 73 days before reducing it in December
and placing the company on watch for a possible downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine got a $1-billion secured credit line and a $600-million
term loan available after the company satisfies certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it might get $250 million in cash from asset sales
as early as the end of next quarter. Calpine is in talks on selling
unspecified "non-strategic" assets.</TE>
<TE>   Cartwright said Calpine also will form a Canadian Royalty Trust
with its stakes in three Canadian power plants to raise $300 million.</TE>

<HD>2000 Hondas, Plymouths Tops With Car Thieves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda Motor Co.'s Civic car had the highest number of thefts among
2000-model cars and trucks during that year and DaimlerChrysler's
Plymouth Breeze sedan had the worst rate, a U.S. agency said.</LD>
<LD>   The theft rate for all 2000 models was 2.89 per 1,000 vehicles,
unchanged from the figure for the previous year, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said. It ranked 206 models, based on
FBI data. DaimlerChrysler had six of the top 10 vehicles by rate.</LD>
<LD>   "Each one of these [Chrysler] vehicles has a modern theft system,"
said Mike Rosenau, a spokesman for the Stuttgart, Germany-based auto
maker's U.S. unit. The results are "not because it is easier to steal
one of these vehicles."</LD>
<TE>   None of the top five in total thefts was a truck. The Civic led
with 1,807 and was followed by DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Intrepid,
General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac Grand Am, the Dodge Neon and Ford
Motor Co.'s Focus. The Grand Am was the 1999 leader.</TE>
<TE>   The Plymouth Breeze led in theft rate, with 11.1 per 1,000. It was
followed by two models of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s Montero
sport-utility vehicle, BMW's X5 sport-utility, and DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler Intrepid. The 1999 leader, Honda's Acura Integra car, fell
to 25th.</TE>
<TE>   The other DaimlerChrysler cars in the top 10 were the Dodge
Stratus, Dodge Intrepid, Plymouth Neon and Dodge Neon.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. agency, which published the figures in a report Tuesday
in the Federal Register, didn't comment on why some vehicles are
stolen more often or at higher rates than others.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's 2000 Civic may have led in number of thefts because the
model was similar to those of the previous five years, making it a
possible target of thieves seeking parts, company spokesman John
Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd expect the theft rate for the 2001 Civic would be down
significantly," because Honda for that model added an immobilizing
system that blocks the starting of the engine without a key, he said.</TE>

<HD>Savers Still Waiting for Higher Yields</HD>
<DH>Investing: Long-term interest rates are up, but short-term
returns may not improve until the second half of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the recent spike in long-term interest rates, savers craving
relief from the lowest short-term yields in decades probably will
have to wait until the second half of the year for better returns,
experts warn.</LD>
<LD>   With economic news improving and fears of terrorism subsiding, the
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has climbed from 4.18%
in November to 5.31% on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But the average yield on a taxable money market mutual fund
slipped last week to a record-low 1.38% from 1.59% at the first of
the year, according to rate-tracking firm IMoneyNet Inc. in
Westborough, Mass.</LD>
<TE>   Savers in short-term certificates of deposit are doing only
slightly better, with rates on six-month CDs averaging 1.77%,
compared with 1.88% at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Those yields have languished even as the yield on six-month
Treasury bills has risen from 1.6% to 2% in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury rates are set by the market. By contrast, banks are free
to set their deposit rates at any level they choose. Analysts say a
big move up in bank rates and other short-term yields will depend on
the Federal Reserve, which seems to be in no hurry to raise its
benchmark interest rate, now at 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Savers could finally get a break in the second half of the year,
said Greg McBride, an analyst with rate-tracking firm Bankrate.com.</TE>
<TE>   If the economic revival continues, he said, the Fed could make
several quick rate increases, pushing the yield on a six-month CD to
the 2.5% range.</TE>
<TE>   That would provide some relief to savers such as William Buchman
of Los Angeles, who have seen their income shrink as a result of the
Fed's aggressive interest rate cuts last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It just takes money away from people who know how to save to prop
up people who haven't done well in business," Buchman, a retired
Hughes Aircraft engineer, said of the Fed's rate-cutting campaign.
"The thrifty people are the ones who have been losing."</TE>
<TE>   Many investors sought the safety of bank accounts as the economy
and stock market soured, lured by government-insured deposits or just
a place to park funds while awaiting a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Savings deposits, which include low-yielding bank money market
accounts, have grown from less than $1.9 trillion at the beginning of
2001 to well over $2.3 trillion this year, Fed statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Investment in CDs declined somewhat during the same period,
falling from more than $1 trillion to slightly below that level for
"small" CDs--those of less than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   But demand remains strong for high-yielding CDs among retirees and
other risk-averse investors, as Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., a
Calabasas mortgage firm, discovered when it started offering other
banking services Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   To attract deposits to its first four bank locations, Countrywide
offered above-average CD rates--for example, 3.2% on a one-year
CD--and advertised the rates in local papers and on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   At the Glendale office, financial counselor Bob Bourgeois said CD
investors, mostly seniors, began coming in from as far away as
Bakersfield, Palmdale, Mission Viejo and Redlands as well as from
nearby areas.</TE>
<TE>   Most were well-versed in strategies for savers, Bourgeois said,
such as buying CDs that mature at regularly spaced intervals.</TE>
<TE>   This "laddering" allows savers regular access to part of their
cash while keeping most of their funds in longer-term instruments,
buffering them from the effect of falling rates.</TE>
<TE>   Even though long-term CDs are paying more than at the end of last
year, many rate watchers advise caution in buying them now.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on five-year CDs, which averaged 4.24% last week, could
rise significantly higher if the Fed raises rates late in the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger is that you're locking up your money for a long time
at an interest rate that's still very low," McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   He advises investors to bide their time by shopping for the best
rate they can find on a six-month CD.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, with interest rates near five-year highs, money
funds were yielding an average 5.4%, "an enticing shelter from the
tempest brewing in the stock market," as McBride puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Since stocks peaked in March 2000, total assets in money market
mutual funds have grown by nearly $625 billion to top $2.2
trillion--even as yields dropped. But much of that money came not
from conservative small investors but from big institutions seeking
shelter for their funds as the stock market plunged.</TE>
<TE>   With most stock indexes moving higher this year and the annualized
dividend yield on the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks at
1.36%--equaling the yield on many money market funds--more of those
institutions will be cashing out of the funds, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "For an investor who had fled equities for the safety of cash on
the sidelines and now is wondering whether the time is right to get
back in, the answer to that question is definitely yes," McBride
believes.</TE>

<HD>Accused Teenager Files SEC Report</HD>
<DH>Probe: Late filing on Internet betting site run by Cole
Bartiromo leaves unanswered questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mission Viejo teenager accused of Internet securities fraud filed a
long-awaited accounting of the money he raised, but the report sheds
little new light on the operation and appears to raise more questions
than it answers.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Cole A. Bartiromo, 17, submitted an eight-page
document to the Securities and Exchange Commission over the weekend,
about a month past the deadline by which Bartiromo had agreed to
provide an accounting as part of a settlement with the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   The agency in January accused the Trabuco Hills High School senior
of bilking investors of more than $1million through a sports-betting
Web site called Invest Better 2001. Bartiromo settled the SEC civil
complaint without admitting guilt. He still could face criminal
charges.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Vasilescu, an SEC attorney in New York, said Tuesday that
much of the filing is based loosely on information federal
authorities already know.</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials previously said they have recovered $1.2 million
from the alleged scam. The filing indicated that nearly $1.1 million
has been turned over to authorities--including $895,000 from an
account at a Costa Rican casino, $121,000 from an electronic payment
system and $25,000 from a personal bank account in Bartiromo's name.</TE>
<TE>   Two other people, Jake Sansome and Scott Burrola, are mentioned as
having turned over $7,000 to authorities, with an additional $20,000
promised. But the report gives no further information, and SEC's
Vasilescu declined to comment about them.</TE>
<TE>   The filing also indicates, without explanation, that Bartiromo
received $1.6 million from third parties and paid back $900,500 to
third parties. Yet the accounting says there was "no loss to third
parties."</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to make sense of it," Vasilescu said of the report.
"We are still not convinced we have the total assets acquired by
Invest Better 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Bartiromo and his San Francisco attorney, David Bayless,
were not returned Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Delay in Disney, EchoStar Legal Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. and Walt Disney Co. agreed to postpone
a hearing so they can pursue settlement talks over whether the
satellite-TV service must continue to carry the ABC Family channel.</LD>
<LD>   The companies asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to delay the
hearing by one week until March 18, said Disney spokesman Eric
Hollreiser.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been continuing conversations with EchoStar in hopes of
reaching a negotiated settlement," Hollreiser said. EchoStar
spokeswoman Judianne Atencio declined to comment on the postponement.</LD>
<TE>   If EchoStar axed the network, Disney would lose 6.4 million of ABC
Family's 84 million subscribers and drop it from the 11th to the 22nd
largest advertising-supported network. The dispute comes as
EchoStar's trying to win regulators' approval to buy Hughes
Electronics Corp., owner of the DirecTV service, for $33.2 billion.
That would create a satellite broadcaster that will reach 90% of the
U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar in December moved to drop ABC
Family from its service, claiming Disney's $5.2-billion purchase of
ABC Family from News Corp. and children's TV producer Haim Saban
voided a 1995 distribution agreement. Burbank-based Disney has argued
EchoStar doesn't have the right to drop ABC Family, formerly known as
the Fox Family channel, until 2005.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gary Allen Feess on Dec. 31 ordered EchoStar
to continue carrying ABC Family. The next hearing is to determine
whether that order should be extended until a trial.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio One Inc., the largest broadcast chain serving African American
audiences, has ordered its program directors to stop talking to
record labels. On Saturday, Radio One executives informed employees
of the new policy during a meeting at the chain's Lanham, Md.,
headquarters attended by most of its top programmers, industry
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Programmers were told to refer all calls from record companies in
the future to its corporate office. The move follows a pledge last
week by Radio One to clean up the music-promotion business at urban
radio, which a Radio One executive told The Times was rife with
illegal cash transactions. Industry sources say Radio One has put one
program director under suspension.</LD>

<HD>Telecom Woes Grow; Probe Widens</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: House committee requests Global Crossing financial
documents as lawmakers begin to look into accounting practices beyond
Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Making good on a promise to expand its probe of business misconduct
beyond the Enron Corp. scandal, a congressional panel Tuesday asked
telecommunications carrier Global Crossing Ltd. to turn over
information concerning its accounting practices and executive
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   The letter from leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
made 22 specific requests, including seeking the names of outside
accountants and lawyers that worked for Global Crossing, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   The committee wrote in its letter that like beleaguered energy
trader Enron, Global Crossing "may have engaged in similar accounting
practices that had the effect of increasing Global Crossing's
revenues without increasing its cash flow."</LD>
<TE>   The letter, addressed to Global Crossing Chief Executive John
Legere, is the first concrete step by congressional investigators to
probe the finances of the telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the House Financial Services Committee said it would
hold a hearing on Global Crossing's accounting practices March 21,
the Wall Street Journal reported.</TE>
<TE>   The company is under investigation by the FBI and Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokeswoman Tuesday declined to comment on the Energy
and Commerce Committee letter. She noted that Legere already has
committed himself "to working with the committee in connection with
this request."</TE>
<TE>   The committee's letter came as a former Global Crossing employee
filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of
co-workers, seeking restitution of lost retirement savings. The two
events significantly raise the legal and economic stakes for the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which is based in Bermuda but has executive
offices in Beverly Hills, spent billions of dollars during the last
five years building a worldwide fiber-optic network. It also was one
of Washington's most generous political donors, giving nearly $3
million in the 1999-2000 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Yet its political and economic clout did little to shield it from
weak demand for high-speed data lines and investor ire over its
bookkeeping practices.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to the committee said the slowing pace of the 3-month-old
Enron investigation has given lawmakers time to switch their focus to
the business practices of Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we have been up to our eyeballs in Enron, but as that
winds down it frees up some of our resources to [determine] if clever
accounting and financial hocus- pocus created an illusion of
profitability" at Global Crossing, committee spokesman Ken Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   In its letter to the company, the committee noted that Global
Crossing and Enron used accounting firm Andersen as their auditor.
The committee expressed particular concern about Global Crossing's
alleged use of a controversial industry sales contract known as an
"indefeasible right of use."</TE>
<TE>   IRUs, similar to real estate leasing,  are used to secure upfront
money in exchange for offering deeply discounted long-term contracts
for transmission capacity on telecommunications networks.</TE>
<TE>   But the predictions of explosive demand for transmission capacity
proved overly optimistic with the demise of thousands of dot-com
companies. And with waning demand, the telecommunications industry
went into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations by the FBI and SEC are focusing on whether the
IRUs were used too liberally to artificially inflate revenue and
profit at Global Crossing and other telecommunications carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy and Commerce Committee also has focused on the
company's decision to forgive the $10-million balance of a loan to
Legere and ease the terms of an $8-million loan to former CEO Thomas
Casey.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiries have "significant implications for the
telecommunications industry and its ability to dig itself out of the
amount of debt it's accumulated to build out their networks," said
Erick Gustafson, director of technology and communications policy at
Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative Washington advocacy
group on tax and economic issues. Global Crossing, he said, "is
emblematic of the lengths some companies will go to influence the
process by currying political favor."</TE>
<TE>   The suspicions that Global Crossing used questionable accounting
techniques to overstate revenue were echoed in the class-action
lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles by Scott Johnson
of Fairfield, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that Global Crossing  executives inflated the
company's true worth and encouraged plan participants and
beneficiaries to continue to maintain substantial investments in
company stock. The suit claims that workers were barred from selling
stock in their 401(k) plans as the share price fell.</TE>
<TE>   A Global Crossing spokeswoman responded: "We believe Global
Crossing has complied with all applicable laws and regulations
regarding the administration of our 401(k) plan."</TE>

<HD>Audit of Homestore Boosts Loss in 2000</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Online real estate firm's internal probe
uncovers $41.4 million in misrecorded revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com, the Westlake Village-based Internet real estate
company, said Tuesday that it completed an internal audit of past
financial statements and determined that $41.4 million of revenue was
improperly recorded in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The restatement caused the company's loss for that year to balloon
27%, the firm said.</LD>
<LD>   Homestore, whose founder and chief executive, Stuart H. Wolff,
resigned in January following disclosures of improper accounting,
said the total reduction in revenue for 2000 was within the range of
$39 million to $45 million the firm had previously estimated.</LD>
<TE>   The company said its net loss for 2000 increased to $146.1
million, or $1.83 a share, from a previously reported loss of $115.2
million, or $1.44 a share. The new revenue figure is $181.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The news was reported after stock trading ended Tuesday. In
regular Nasdaq trading, Homestore shares fell 6 cents to $1.23.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's investigation revealed that in 2000, revenue totaling
$36.4 million should have been recorded as barter transactions. "It
was also determined that there was insufficient support to establish
the fair value of these barter exchanges," Homestore said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the firm said, the investigation showed that the
shipment of certain software products recorded as $5 million in 2000
"did not meet all revenue recognition requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Long, who took over for Wolff as CEO, said that although
the company still must restate its 2001 quarterly reports later this
month, he is satisfied that the accounting inquiry is closed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Internet advertising agency L90 Inc.
said accountants would review two transactions in the second and
third quarters of 2001 between the company and Homestore.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's internal audit committee is investigating whether L90
overstated revenue for the transactions, and if there are additional
transactions of a similar nature. The committee also is examining
barter transactions, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of L90 rose 3 cents to $1.21 on Friday, the last day they
traded. The Nasdaq Stock Market, which halted trading pending
additional information from L90, said trading would resume today.</TE>

<HD>Kroger Profit Down 4.8% on Expenses, Slower Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kroger Co., the largest U.S. grocery-store chain, said fiscal
fourth-quarter profit dropped 4.8% because of slower sales and costs
to eliminate jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $350.4million, or 43 cents a share, from $367.9
million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, Kroger said. Sales in the
quarter ended Feb. 2 fell 4.4% to $12.1 billion, from $12.7 billion
in the year-ago quarter, which had an extra week.</LD>
<LD>   Kroger, which operates Ralph's and Food4Less stores in California,
had severance and other expenses as it began a plan to trim costs by
more than $500 million over two years. The company in December
decided to fire 1,500 workers this year. Kroger also is cutting
prices to compete with rivals including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which
is adding warehouse-sized stores with food departments as well as
smaller supermarkets, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "The shift is going in Wal-Mart's favor," said Jonathan Ziegler,
an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, who rates Kroger a "buy" and
doesn't personally own the stock. "They're just facing a lot of
competition."</TE>
<TE>   Kroger shares fell 57 cents, or 2.5%, to $21.98 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have fallen 11% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Identical-store sales, which exclude replacement stores, will show
a slight improvement this quarter over the 0.8% gain in the third
quarter, Chief Executive Joseph Pichler said on a conference call
with investors. They dropped 0.3% in the fourth quarter; sales at
food stores open at least a year rose 0.3%, Cincinnati-based Kroger
said.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses related to restructuring efforts will be about $10
million less than Kroger had forecast, Pichler said. About two-thirds
of the $500 million in cost reductions expected from the moves will
be achieved this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time expenses of $31.7 million, Kroger said it would
have earned $382.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter. On that basis, the company met the 47-cent average estimate
of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>

<HD>Lettuce Woes Costing Consumers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Cold weather in Arizona has left a shortage in
California. Prices are at 15-year highs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BRICE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lettuce in Arizona should be ready for harvest, but it's not. The
lettuce in Central California won't be ready for at least four more
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves California facing one of its worst lettuce shortages
and highest prices in 15 years, according to state agricultural
specialists.</LD>
<LD>   And when California has a shortage, the whole nation has a
shortage. The result has been lettuce costing up to $3 a head.</LD>
<TE>   That's because more than 50% of the nation's lettuce comes from
three California areas--the Imperial Valley in the southeastern
corner of the state, the area centered around Huron in Fresno County
and the area around Salinas in Monterey County, said Jesus Valencia,
farm advisor for the University of California system.</TE>
<TE>   The lettuce farms rotate harvests to maintain a year-round supply.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Valley usually harvests in the late fall, Huron in
the spring and Salinas in the late spring and summer.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetable wholesalers rely on Arizona, because of its warm
weather, during the winter months.</TE>
<TE>   But a spell of unusually cold weather this year stunted most of
Arizona's lettuce crops, pushing back their harvest window, Valencia
said.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial Valley lettuce production also turned out to be weaker
than expected and Huron crops may follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the cold weather, the crops didn't get as big and we
didn't get as many," said Eric Schwartz, president of operations at
Dole Fresh Vegetables in Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the East Coast had an unusually mild winter,
which kept the shipping routes open and the demand for lettuce high.</TE>
<TE>   The steady demand and diminished supply translate into
skyrocketing prices for most of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Markets have seen record prices in Northern California, jumping
from around $12 a carton to nearly $50.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while, Mother Nature comes along and slaps us in
the face," said Henry Gong, owner of the Star Market in Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Gong and his competitors have had to charge up to
$3 for a head of lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Skuba of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Fruit and
Vegetable Market News said he's never seen prices this high in his 25
years as a market reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Cartons hit $40 in 1995 after the Salinas floods wiped out much of
the region's lettuce, he said, but those high prices didn't last
long.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts also attribute the rise in prices to a reduction in
the amount farmers planted this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department said U.S. farmers planted 179,000 acres
of lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage between January and
March, down 6% from the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how long the shortage will last, but most experts
think it will be at least four more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Huron farms should be ready for harvest.</TE>
<TE>   But that could set up the market for another problem, Valencia
said.</TE>
<TE>   If Arizona farms don't harvest soon, the market may be flooded by
a double harvest, driving down prices and hurting farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who have lettuce now are happy," Valencia said. "But by
the time the others get theirs harvested, there might be too much on
the market. It might not even be worth harvesting."</TE>

shoppers to the weather's effect on lettuce grown in Arizona. The
state's crop is counted on this time of year, but low production and
high demand have sent prices skyrocketing to as much as $3 a head.</CP>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp.'s former Chief Executive Chuck Conaway will receive at
least $9.5 million as part of his severance package from the bankrupt
retailer.</LD>
<LD>   Under the company's severance policy, Conaway is entitled to three
times his base salary, which is about $1.5 million a year. Kmart also
will forgive a $5-million loan it gave Conaway last year.</LD>
<LD>   An amendment to his contract filed Jan. 22 also entitled him to an
additional $6.5-million bonus if he stayed with the company through
July 2003 or was terminated for any reason before then.</LD>
<TE>   Conaway said he would accept one-third of that amount, or about $2
million. Conaway also was granted unspecified stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Those terms were subject to approval by a bankruptcy judge in
Chicago.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russia said it wants the right to inspect U.S. poultry plants, a
demand that came as the two countries were in tense negotiations
after Russia banned imports of American chicken.</LD>
<LD>   The countries were in talks this week about the Russian ban, which
went into effect Sunday. Moscow says it is worried about sanitary
conditions at U.S. plants and the use of antibiotics and feed
additives. U.S. officials said the ban is not justified
scientifically and is protectionism.</LD>
<LD>   Chicken is the top American export to Russia, bringing more than
$600million a year.</LD>
<TE>   Russia is pushing for permission to send delegations to inspect
U.S. plants that have shipped low-quality poultry to Russia or failed
to produce required delivery documents.</TE>
<TE>   Some allege that Russia's ban is a preemptive move to retaliate
for U.S. duties on steel imports announced last week--an accusation
Russian officials deny.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is expected to buy time in a
looming political dispute over the federal debt ceiling by
maneuvering some funds the government manages for federal retirees,
congressional officials and lobbyists said.</LD>
<LD>   The move is legal and was used by Robert E. Rubin, President
Clinton's Treasury secretary, to avoid an unprecedented federal
default during a 1995 budget fight with Congress.</LD>
<LD>   If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, O'Neill can shift
money in retirement funds the Treasury Department invests for federal
retirees into non-interest-bearing accounts.</LD>
<TE>   By shifting that money, it is no longer considered to count
against the federal borrowing limit. That frees up room for the
Treasury to borrow more money to keep the government running and
paying its bills.</TE>
<TE>   The money--along with all lost interest--eventually would be put
back into interest-bearing instruments.</TE>

service for commuters in U.S. cities with traffic congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Terms weren't disclosed. Honda supplies autos to closely held
Mobility, which runs the service under the Flexcar name from outlets
near commuter rail and bus stations in Washington, D.C.; Seattle; and
Portland, Ore., Honda spokesman Art Garner said.</LD>
<LD>   Members use the fee-based service to reserve cars and trucks by
the hour. Flexcar serves more than 4,000 commuters in the three
cities, with a 110-auto fleet. Honda's investment will help the
business expand to as many as 30 metro areas in five years, Flexcar
Chief Executive Neil Peterson said.</LD>
<TE>   Flexcar fees range from $35 for five hours to $525 for 100 hours,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Woes Grow; Probe Widens</HD>
<DH>Sector: Barrage of bad news on earnings and accounting
takes a toll on equipment makers and service providers, reversing
recent upward move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The telecom recovery that appeared to be underway vaporized Tuesday
after dismal forecasts from equipment manufacturer Lucent
Technologies Inc. and cell phone maker Nokia sent stocks throughout
the sector sliding.</LD>
<LD>   Concerns about accounting practices added to the skittishness, as
No. 2 long-distance provider WorldCom Inc. said it had been asked to
turn over financial documents to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and congressional investigators requested information
about bookkeeping at Global Crossing Ltd. The combined effect was to
force investors and analysts to reconsider whether the long-suffering
sector had indeed hit bottom, or whether it could drop even further.</LD>
<LD>   With capital spending down 20% to 30% this year compared with
2001, equipment manufacturers can expect things to get worse before
they get better, said John Gonsalves, a vice president with Adventis,
a management consulting firm in Boston that focuses on the
communications sector. Demand won't pick up until the second half of
the year, and a real recovery is unlikely until 2003, when a new
round of corporate budgeting takes effect, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be a long road to recovery," said Bill Wyman, an
analyst with the Precursor Group research firm in Washington.
"Telecom right now is decoupling from the rest of the" economy.</TE>
<TE>   The clearest sign of that came from Lucent, which said it wouldn't
return to profitability until fiscal 2003. Three weeks ago, the
Murray Hill, N.J.-based firm predicted that it would move into the
black in the current fiscal year, which ends in September. Lucent,
which has shed tens of thousands of jobs, also cut its quarterly
revenue forecast by one-third. As a result, the company's shares
dropped nearly 10% on Tuesday, losing 61 cents to close at $5.65 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom was an even bigger loser, dropping 12% after disclosing
that the SEC requested documents concerning a loan to Chief Executive
Bernard Ebbers and other financial practices. Ebbers told attendees
at a Merrill Lynch investors conference that his company was in full
compliance with SEC regulations. Still, WorldCom shares closed at
$7.93, down $1.08, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel Networks Corp. suffered a 6% loss after Moody's Investors
Service cut the credit ratings for the world's largest telecom
equipment maker to one notch above "junk" status and signaled it
could cut the ratings further. Shares of the Brampton, Canada-based
firm lost 36 cents to close at $5.65 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, cell phone giant Nokia lowered its sales outlook for
the first three months of the year and saw its shares drop 6%,
despite forecasts that it could beat its profit target for the
quarter. Nokia fell $1.41 to $22.09 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Other casualties of the day included networking equipment makers
Cisco Systems Inc., Ciena Corp. and Alcatel and cell phone makers
Ericsson and Siemens.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom firms could accelerate their own recovery by introducing
products and services--such as streaming media, videoconferencing and
distance learning--that would eat up much of the broadband capacity
that has created the current glut, Gonsalves said. New products would
entice businesses and consumers to boost spending, which in turn
would drive sales of new infrastructure equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Service providers need to take the initiative to [create]
applications that would drive bandwidth demand," he said. "The onus
is on them to come up with new stuff."</TE>

<HD>Hewlett Intensifies Criticism of Fiorina in Conference Call</HD>
<DH>Tech: Dissident HP director says CEO has made Compaq merger
a referendum on herself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In his most pointed remarks to date, dissident Hewlett-Packard Co.
director Walter Hewlett used a conference call with investors Tuesday
to increase his criticism of HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and
reiterate his prediction that she'll lose her job if shareholders
reject HP's acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "She has made this merger a referendum on herself," Hewlett said
in his first conference call for all HP investors and the public.</LD>
<LD>   If the $22-billion merger dies and Fiorina goes, Hewlett said he
expected to be named to a board committee seeking a successor. He
predicted the committee would find a technology firm CEO.</LD>
<TE>   "This time around, we do not want someone learning on the job,"
Hewlett said. He added that most senior managers probably would stay
at HP.</TE>
<TE>   The escalating rhetoric is a sign of how close the Tuesday vote is
expected to be.</TE>
<TE>   Each day is marked by new full-page newspaper ads touting the
endorsement or opposition of another expert or investor.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional Shareholder Services last week backed the deal.
Since then, two large investors, the California Public Employees'
Retirement System and Wells Fargo Co., have opposed it, though HP
said it had most of the largest 20 holders in its camp.</TE>
<TE>   HP took umbrage at Hewlett's latest remarks, having termed his
calls for Fiorina's post-vote departure "baseless and irresponsible."</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike many of our competitors, HP has remained profitable under
Carly Fiorina's leadership during this economic downturn," HP
spokeswoman Rebecca Robboy said.</TE>
<TE>   "The HP board, with the exception of Mr. Hewlett, is unequivocal
in their support of Carly."</TE>
<TE>   On the call, Hewlett repeated his core argument that HP is paying
too much for Compaq and is essentially trading a stake in its
profitable printing business for a bigger piece of the unprofitable
and slower-growing PC business.</TE>
<TE>   "Scale alone does not lead to profitability," said Hewlett, who as
the eldest son of HP's co-founder partially controls a large chunk of
the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   "If scale was the answer, [No. 3] HP would be less profitable than
[No. 2] Compaq" in personal computers, whereas the reverse is true.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett said the combined company, in winning a No. 1 or No. 2
position in all manner of computer markets, would wind up trying to
be all things to all customers, from a supplier of commodity PCs to a
high-end systems integrator.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a chef trying to simultaneously compete with McDonald's
and Le Cirque," he said. "It can't out-Dell Dell and out-IBM IBM at
the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina said in a conference call for big investors Monday that HP
had considered and rejected a wide range of alternatives, including
shutting down its PC business.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided against it in part because 25% of the company's
printing products are sold bundled with HP computers.</TE>

<HD>Dow Continues Winning Ways</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Blue chips recover from early dip; tech hit by
lower sales forecasts. Mexican index rises to 20-month high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street struggled to a mixed finish Tuesday, with blue-chip
indexes little changed while the technology sector suffered renewed
selling.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury bond market was relatively calm after the surge in
yields in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican stock market continued to rocket, with the key index
reaching a 20-month high.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, stocks opened sharply lower, then pared their
losses as buyers returned.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from a 100-point drop
at the opening to close up 21.11 points, or 0.2%, at 10,632.35, the
highest since June.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended down 2.68 points or
0.2%, at 1,165.58.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite sank 32.37 points, or 1.7%, to
1,897.12, though it closed up from its session low of 1,879.</TE>
<TE>   Weak sales predictions and news of more accounting investigations
in the telecom sector weighed on Nasdaq. Lucent Technologies slid 61
cents, nearly 10%, to $5.65 after lowering its revenue and profit
outlook. Cellular phone maker Nokia fell $1.41, or 6%, to $22.09
after it also warned of weaker sales.</TE>
<TE>   Those warnings "are reminding investors that the tech recovery is
going to lag the economic recovery because business spending will
continue to lag consumer spending," said John Forelli, money manager
at Independence Investment.</TE>
<TE>   Strong indications that the economy is reviving have lifted
blue-chip stocks in recent weeks. The tech sector had lagged behind
until last week, when Nasdaq soared 7%. Tuesday's news put a dent in
that rally.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the Dow is up 6.1% while the Nasdaq index is
down 2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, long-term yields stabilized for a second day
after jumping last week on expectations that a stronger economy will
mean higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury note yield eased to
5.31% from 5.32% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico City, the IPC share index zoomed 116.66 points, or 1.6%,
to 7,278.06, highest since July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been eager buyers in the Mexican market this year
on hopes that a U.S. economic revival also would pull up the Mexican
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The IPC index has risen 14.2% since Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow was boosted by IBM, which surged $3.26 to $108.50.
Analysts said issues raised in recent weeks about the company's
accounting methods were put to rest after the firm's expanded
financial disclosure in its 2001 annual report appeared to contain no
damaging information.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft tumbled $1.80 to $62.54 after brokerage Goldman
Sachs said the company's sales performance in the next fiscal year
would be lower than many analysts predicted.</TE>
<TE>   * Among other tech giants, Cisco Systems fell 65 cents to $16.77,
Dell Computer lost 71 cents to $28, Adobe Systems fell $2.22 to
$38.12 and Broadcom was off $2.15 to $41.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue chips, appliance giants Maytag and Whirlpool rallied
after Maytag raised earnings estimates, saying sales have been better
than expected. Both companies have benefited from strong home sales.</TE>
<TE>   Maytag leaped $4.63 to $45.30. Whirlpool gained $2.83 to $79.66.</TE>
<TE>   * Many home builders also advanced. KB Home gained 53 cents to
$45.27; William Lyon Homes jumped $2.13 to $21.15.</TE>
<TE>   * Some consumer-product stocks were strong. Procter &amp; Gamble
gained $1.18 to $85.28, Colgate Palmolive rose $1.17 to $55.27 and
Avon was up 81 cents to $52.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Anteon International shares rose $2.05 to $20.05 in their debut
on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fairfax, Va.-based company, a
provider of information services to the Pentagon, priced its initial
public offering at $18 a share Monday. The stock's ticker symbol is

<LD>Argentina plans to start closing the weakest of the nation's 87 banks
as early as next month and merge others as the government prepares to
lift restrictions on withdrawals and money transfers.</LD>
<LD>   A new state agency will begin assessing which banks to let fail
after the April 15 deadline for depositors to decide whether to
convert frozen savings into new government bonds, Finance Secretary
Lisandro Barry said.</LD>
<LD>   Banks in Argentina face tens of billions of dollars of losses
because of the government's default on $95 billion of bonds and
devaluation of the peso.</LD>
<TE>   It is too early to forecast how many banks may collapse. The
central bank already has backed a plan to bail out the nation's
biggest publicly traded bank, Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires.</TE>

<LD>Compuware Corp. filed a lawsuit claiming that IBM  Corp. is stealing
Compuware's software and forcing customers to buy IBM products.
Compuware, which makes software for managing mainframe computers,
accused IBM of copyright infringement and violations of federal
antitrust laws. IBM is stealing Compuware's copyrighted software
products for IBM's File Manager and Fault Analyzer programs, and
including a user manual with "numerous passages that are nearly
verbatim copies of Compuware manuals," the suit contends. Compuware

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to resolve its antitrust woes in Europe, Microsoft Corp. is
proposing concessions that go beyond those agreed to in the United
States to help rivals ensure their equipment can operate with its
dominant Windows software.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft's chief European attorney, John Frank, said the two new
measures are in addition to steps included in the software giant's
proposed settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft opponents attacked the announcement as a "public
relations exercise" that fell short of addressing anti-competitive
charges.</LD>
<TE>   The latest move is more evidence of Microsoft's switch to a more
conciliatory tone in recent months as it strives to settle the EU
case and avoid a hefty penalty, outside lawyers said. Last December
Microsoft waived its right to a hearing, saying it wanted to focus on
a reaching a settlement.</TE>

<LD>EarthLink Inc. reached agreement with AT&amp;T Corp. to sell high-speed
Internet access through the biggest U.S. cable company's network,
boosting EarthLink's access to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Internet providers such as EarthLink are trying to forge
agreements with cable operators to expand their high-speed Web
offerings as growth slows with customers who connect through regular
phone lines. High-speed access typically costs twice as much as
slower dial-up service, and consumers often spend more time and money
online when connected at faster speeds.</LD>
<LD>   More than 875,000 new customers signed up for cable-modem service
during the last three months of 2001, up from 6.4 million subscribers
at the end of the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   EarthLink plans to offer high-speed access over AT&amp;T cable lines
in Seattle and Boston this year, with more cities next year.</TE>
<TE>   EarthLink rose 89 cents to $10.58 on Nasdaq. AT&amp;T climbed 7 cents
to $16.14 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CMGI Inc., an Internet venture firm that owns Internet-search service
AltaVista Co., had a fiscal second-quarter profit on a gain from
retiring $220 million in loans from Compaq Computer Corp. Net income
was $15.2 million, or 20 cents a share, in the period ended Jan. 31,
the company said, primarily because of a $133-million gain from
ending loans stemming from its 1999 purchase of AltaVista from
Compaq. In the year-earlier quarter, CMGI had a loss of $2.54
billion, or $7.79 a share.</LD>

<HD>Tricon to Buy A&amp;W and Long John Silver's Chains</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The company, which has focused on multiple
branding, also says it will change its name to Yum! Brands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fast-food restaurant giant Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., building
on its successful strategy of offering customers a variety of menu
items under one roof, said Tuesday it agreed to acquire the A&amp;W and
Long John Silver's chains.</LD>
<LD>   Tricon, the Louisville, Ky., parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza
Hut, agreed to buy the two chains from closely held Yorkshire Global
Restaurants for $270 million in cash, and would assume $50 million in
debt. Tricon previously had signed a deal that added A&amp;W's root beer
floats and Long John Silver's fish platters to menus at some of
Tricon's restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   More than any other restaurant company, Tricon has embraced
multi-branding. The chain now operates 1,500 combination restaurants
and generates $1.5billion in annual sales from Taco Bell, KFC and
Pizza Hut combinations. The addition of Long John Silver's and A&amp;W's
fare should boost sales and profit, said Tony Howard, an analyst with
Hilliard Lyons.</LD>
<TE>   Tricon's stock, however, fell $1.91 a share to $55.60 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;W, billed as the nation's oldest fast-food chain, was founded in
1919 and has 970 restaurants. Long John Silver's, founded in 1969,
has 1,225 outlets and is the nation's largest fast-food seafood
chain. Together, the chains generated sales of nearly $1.1 billion
last year.</TE>
<TE>   With the fast-food market becoming evermore competitive, burger,
chicken and pizza chains are looking for new ways to grow, said Tim
Carlin, a senior associate at Technomic Inc., a restaurant research
and consulting firm near Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's Corp. snapped up Boston Market and burrito-maker
Chipotle to expand into the fast-growing quick-casual market.
Similarly, CKE Restaurants Inc. has entered the booming sector with
its purchase of the La Salsa Mexican-food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Tricon, which also announced Tuesday it would change its name to
Yum! Brands Inc. to reflect its growing stable of brands, has opted
to focus on multiple branding. Chief Executive David Novak said
multi-branding has proven popular with Tricon customers since its
introduction seven years ago, and has bolstered its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   When single-concept restaurants are converted into multi-brand
units, sales jump 20% to 30% and profit grows 25% to 40%, Novak said,
helping Tricon restaurants close the gap between industry leader
McDonald's. Current average unit volumes at Tricon stores in the U.S.
are about 60% of those at McDonald's restaurants, which offer
customers more meal choices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of Long John Silver's and A&amp;W, Tricon expects to
have 5,700 restaurants offering at least two brands within the next
five years, he said. Tricon operates more than 30,000 restaurants
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Tricon also is looking to acquire smaller, emerging brands to
extend the reach of its Pizza Hut brand, Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a strong fourth quarter, when earnings surged a
better-than-expected 28%, the company also said it expects
first-quarter operating profit to be at the "high end" of its
previously announced estimates of 74 cents to 78 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Tricon also expects the deal to boost its overseas expansion for
Taco Bell, Novak said. A Taco Bell and Long John Silver's union could
be particularly fruitful in Latin America and Asia, where Tricon
already has a strong presence, Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   But Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in
Los Angeles, said Tricon's acquisition and increased emphasis on
multi-branding raises some concerns. "Running one restaurant business
effectively is a huge challenge in itself, and now they have five of
them,'' he said.</TE>

<HD>Canal Plus Sues NDS Group</HD>
<DH>Media: In a rare move, Vivendi unit alleges News
Corp.-controlled rival conspired to open up the firm's digital TV
service to piracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's Canal Plus Group on Tuesday accused a competitor
controlled by News Corp. of sabotaging a security system for its
digital TV service, in a rare lawsuit that exposes the fierce
rivalries between media giants.</LD>
<LD>   In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Canal
Plus alleges that NDS Group conspired to illegally crack its digital
TV "smart card" and then provided the code to a Web site frequented
by counterfeiters.</LD>
<LD>   NDS, based in Britain, is the leading maker of security software
for digital TV and is a rival to Canal's technology division based in
Cupertino, Calif. The suit seeks more than $1 billion in damages.</LD>
<TE>   "We will not stand by and let such illegal activities, which shake
the foundation of the digital TV business, go unpunished," said
Francois Carayol, Canal Plus Technologies chief executive. Canal Plus
is the European television and film division of Vivendi Universal,
Europe's largest media company.</TE>
<TE>   NDS called the claims "outrageous and baseless" and said it plans
to file a counterclaim. Group President Abe Peled denied that his
company had any involvement in piracy and said Canal Plus had only
itself to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "This lawsuit is a blatant attempt by Canal Plus both to deflect
criticism of its new-generation card, which is not believed to be
state of the art, and to shift blame for its inadequate technology
and its past losses," Peled said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also contends that Canal was trying to lure away the
very employee it accuses of cracking the security system.</TE>
<TE>   The  lawsuit is likely to exacerbate the acrimony between
flamboyant Vivendi CEO Jean-Marie Messier and News Corp.  Chairman
Rupert Murdoch, whose companies are competing for dominance of the
pay-television market in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are out to eat each other's lunch so they're always
looking at ways to get a competitive advantage," said George Nichols,
a media analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also comes amid a fierce push by Hollywood studios to
fight piracy of movies from the Internet and digital TV.
Entertainment giants, including News Corp.'s Fox, have aggressively
lobbied in Washington for copyright protection technology.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Hollywood studios have presented a united front in
combating piracy and have not pointed the finger at one another.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a certain poetic justice here," said Gary Klein, vice
president of the Consumer Electronics Assn. in Arlington, Va. "You
have a content company that recently accused the consumer electronics
industry of fostering piracy now being accused of piracy."</TE>
<TE>   The seriousness of the allegations surprised many analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Piracy is something you expect from hackers in their bedrooms and
not from corporations," Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus' lawsuit centers on so-called smart cards, which play a
crucial role for most satellite and overseas cable TV companies,
acting as the key that opens the electronic locks on programming.
Subscribers need a special set-top receiver to tune in the
programming, and the receiver cannot unscramble the shows without a
smart card.</TE>
<TE>   TV pirates try to defeat the system by creating fake smart cards
with copies of the software keys needed to unscramble programming. If
they succeed, they enable  users to watch pay-per-view movies and
other premium programming for free.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every scrambling system has been hacked, industry
executives say, forcing satellite and cable operators to fight back
with electronic countermeasures or new smart cards.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus' technology is used by 12.5 million customers, mostly
in Europe. NDS,  80%-owned by News Corp., has about 27.3 million
users.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus claims that NDS used top engineers at a laboratory in
Israel to crack the Canal Plus smart card and then provided the
security code in 1999 to a Web site used by counterfeiters. Canal
Plus contends that the action encouraged the illegal copying of its
smart card and has hindered the company's efforts to expand its
business in Europe and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The company alleges violations of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, copyright laws and California laws on
unfair business practices.  Canal offered no evidence to support its
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention is to provide that evidence in the course of the
lawsuit," Carayol said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jon Healey contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>It's Simple Things That Stir the Soul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>GUTAY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Everyday things can be beautiful. We owe ourselves that much, at
least.</LD>
<LD>   I'm holding in my hand the humblest of household objects. But
there's no dime-store ordinariness here. In this implement, function
fuses with sculpture. It is an encounter between the artistry of
nature and the artistry of a human.</LD>
<LD>   Sensate, tactile, beautiful, it is a wooden spoon.</LD>
<TE>   It is the work of a man who has spent 30 years carving unique,
whimsical and exuberantly purposeful kitchen utensils from hardwoods
in the arid, windblown mountains east of San Diego. Just right for,
say, stirring that all-day pot of chili bubbling on the stove top, or
maybe swirling the pasta water.</TE>
<TE>   William Chappelow is a pioneer in a trend that has taken deep root
in the U.S. The artisan is back with us, making our lives more
pleasant and expressive.</TE>
<TE>   Grasp one of Bill's gracefully elongated cocobolo spoons. Or one
of his tiny, hatchet-like butter knives carved from osage orange. Or
his "left-handed elk-burger with bell pepper and extra garlic stir
fryer" shaped from the bent limb of a lemon tree. An old, dormant
node reactivates in the primordial memory.</TE>
<TE>   Since few of us carry clubs anymore, the wooden spoon and its
kitchen work-tool cousins may be the oldest and most widely shared
implements of human existence.</TE>
<TE>   I've come here to this unpretentious, stone-walled gallery--where
the spoon and the spatula and spurtle and stirrer are celebrated--to
remind myself that America is not as uniform, as single-minded, as
bland, as hectically efficient, as coldly without soul as so often
portrayed.</TE>
<TE>   We Americans live in duality.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the things in life, and some of the best of things, are
industrially produced and mass-marketed. But not all things. Growth
mania, the runaway assaults of marketing, the obsession with mergers
and the drone of macroeconomic news account for neither the vigor nor
the importance of resurgent artisanship in our culture. Two trends
pull in opposite directions, but one of them gets forgotten. Almost
any technology gizmo that some knucklehead can dream up is sure to
draw breathless news, although few of them prove half as useful as a
figured walnut mayo paddle with "hand-feel."</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, there were only a handful of craftsmen who could
make you a pair of custom cowboy boots in traditional fashion. Today
there are schools to teach the craft. Quilting, long a hobby, now
achieves the level of art. Shade-tree cheese makers and hot-sauce
bottlers abound. Not long ago, I met a man who traveled America
selling handmade brooms so artful that you wanted to grab one and
sweep. An old friend makes and sells deeply mysterious bookends from
fossilized whalebone he finds on secret beaches. When an oak tree
blew over in the yard 30 years ago and Bill Chappelow withdrew his
first spoon from it, he knew of no professional kitchen utensil
makers anywhere. Today, he can count perhaps two dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there are the many hapless people with bad taste or bad luck
who are going broke in their booths at the crafts fairs. But our
growing hunger for something handmade rather than machine-produced
has meant all the success that true artisans like Chappelow can
handle, and then some. At one time, his utensils appeared in 40
galleries and 1,000 more wanted his work.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, I had five or six part-time employees. To meet the
demand, I calculated that I'd have to hire 60 people," the easy-going
Chappelow recalls. "In contemplating that, I made a conscious
decision to do just the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Entrepreneurs, we can remind ourselves, are not all out to conquer
the world. A good many have a different purpose in life. Today,
Chappelow is down to just three galleries and two employees. Most of
his work is sold from his shop on a two-lane road to nowhere in
particular, where he can offer each visitor a natural history lesson
on wood and conservation and sometimes an informal wine tasting.</TE>
<TE>   His advertising consists of leaving brochures at a few B&amp;Bs and
tourist spots when he heads out for a hike. And he's cutting back on
that too.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Sept. 11, business has soared. Right now, he cannot
keep the display walls filled.</TE>
<TE>   People trickle in all day long. They rub their hands over his wood
creations and buy one or two, and many aren't sure why, says
Chappelow.</TE>
<TE>   I'm guessing it has to do with that pot of chili ready for the
stove back home, and those essentials that come without circuitry or
garish logos or celebrity endorsements. The simple things, made
beautiful to exalt the everyday.</TE>

<LD>Black leaders in South-Central Los Angeles courting white homeowner
and business leaders from the harbor area? What brings these unusual
partners together?</LD>
<LD>   Both groups, it seems, have it in for Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   In South-Central, Hahn's decision not to support Bernard C. Parks
for a second term as police chief is seen as a slap in the face of a
loyal constituency. Harbor residents fume that little is being done
to address concerns over the environmental impact of port operations.</LD>
<TE>   That these unusual political alliances are forming suggests one
inescapable conclusion: There is a vacuum of power in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, L.A. politics was a relatively quiet affair, run from
behind the scenes by powerful downtown Anglo business interests.</TE>
<TE>   As political scientist Raphael J. Sonenshein has argued, it wasn't
until Tom Bradley was elected mayor in 1973 that a fundamental shift
occurred in L.A. politics. The new order was an alliance of Westside
Jews and South-Central blacks behind a liberal philosophy and their
shared history of exclusion from power.</TE>
<TE>   Since the demise of the 20-year Bradley coalition, however,
efforts to form a new, stable ruling coalition in Los Angeles have
failed spectacularly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Richard Riordan was elected mayor by a coalition of San
Fernando Valley conservatives and Latinos. Absent a viable
challenger, Riordan repeated the feat in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But although he assembled a successful electoral coalition,
Riordan never created a stable governing coalition.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, neither the Valley nor Latinos were central
players in Riordan's administration. By the end of his tenure,
neither was particularly enamored of Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer's Hahn versus Antonio Villaraigosa mayoral contest
produced another political odd couple: West Valley conservatives
aligned with South-Central blacks to elect Hahn. Yet it didn't take
long for this coalition to fall apart. The issue of police reform--in
particular Parks--exposed the inherent weakness of the partnership.
Some observers think the mayor wants to expand his political base by
appointing a Latino police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Secession movements are another manifestation of the lack of
consensus in L.A. politics, and they underscore the heightened
potential for bizarre coalitions. Both Valley and harbor
secessionists have begun reaching out to black leaders in hopes of
creating pro-secession alliances. The implicit pitch: Just think how
much more influence you'd have in a smaller city, where you wouldn't
have to deal with us.</TE>
<TE>   What do these strange alliances say about politics in Los Angeles?
They might suggest that multiethnic democracy is alive and well;
because no one interest can dominate the agenda, groups must build
cross-community bridges if they want to get things done. Or they
might mean that Los Angeles has become something of a political Tower
of Babel--a chaotic and destructive place pitting disparate
communities against one another for services and influence.</TE>
<TE>   It is this latter interpretation that secessionists seek to
exploit. At base, secession is an argument to narrow the diversity of
interests in the political arena. It presupposes that communities
will be better able to control their destiny with fewer competing
interests.</TE>
<TE>   The implications of secession go beyond the usual discussion of
fiscal or service-related matters. If and when a measure is placed on
the ballot, the vote will be a referendum on whether and how well
democracy can function in an arena of diversity.</TE>

<LD>During the Cold War, peace was supported by the doctrine of "mutual
assured destruction," which simply meant that each side maintained
second strike capability, thereby deterring nuclear war. The
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and other treaties limiting the use of
offensive nuclear forces were the underpinning of this doctrine. They
were also the basis for ending the nuclear arms race.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Bush administration has moved to a new nuclear doctrine
described by one commentator as "unilateral assured destruction."</LD>
<LD>   Should the recently leaked Nuclear Posture Review, or NPR, become
official policy, we can expect nuclear weapons to spread around the
world.</LD>
<TE>   We will live in a far more dangerous world, and the United States
will be much less secure.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports describing the NPR, Russia is still a
possible target, but potentially by offensive forces rather than
second-strike nuclear forces. China also could be a target, with a
"military confrontation over the status of Taiwan" a possible
rationale for a nuclear strike.</TE>
<TE>   The NPR goes even further. It explicitly lists Libya, Syria, Iraq,
Iran and North Korea as potential targets for U.S. nuclear forces,
putting aside the ambiguity employed in previous reports. One
thing--perhaps the only thing--that these five states have in common,
however, is that all are nonnuclear parties to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.</TE>
<TE>   For 30 years, this treaty has kept nuclear weapons from spreading
all over the world, a development that would be devastating to U.S.
security.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, however, that in 1978, to bolster the treaty, the
United States, Britain and the Soviet Union formally pledged never to
use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries that were parties to
the treaty except in the case of an attack in alliance with a nuclear
weapon state. (No exception was made for responding to chemical or
biological attacks.)</TE>
<TE>   This pledge, joined by France and China, was reiterated in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   And in what could be the most reasonable request in the history of
international relations, in exchange for agreeing to never acquire
nuclear weapons, 182 nonnuclear nations asked that the five nuclear
weapons states promise never to attack them with such weapons. This
was done in April 1995 in connection with a U.N. Security Council
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pentagon plan undermines the credibility of that pledge,
which underpins the nonproliferation treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the basic implication of the NPR--that the U.S. reserves
the right to target any nation with nuclear weapons whenever it
chooses to do so--is itself likely to increase the risk of the
nuclear weapons proliferation. If a country believes it's falling out
of favor with Washington, what is the first thing it is likely to do?
A quote attributed to Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes
provides some insight: "Before one challenges the United States, one
must first acquire nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the NPR also appears to set forth a 40-year plan for
developing and acquiring new nuclear weapons. It reportedly calls for
new air, sea and land launch platforms to be developed and deployed
in 2020, 2030 and 2040, and it calls for new low-yield and
variable-yield warheads that probably would require nuclear testing.
Maintaining a permanent rationale for a robust U.S. nuclear arsenal
and a resumption of nuclear testing flies in the face of vital U.S.
commitments.</TE>
<TE>   These matters are far too important for the administration to
decide on its own. There must be a full public debate, in Congress,
on the future of our nuclear deterrent and the nuclear
nonproliferation regime.</TE>

<HD>A Beautiful Man Is Besmirched by Enquiring Minds</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week I was invited to a colleague's class at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism to talk about my 1998
biography of mathematical genius John Nash, "A Beautiful Mind." The
class is called "Writing About Ideas," but not a single student asked
me about Nash's Nobel Prize-winning work. What they most wanted to
hear was tabloid fare. That brought home just how far from reality
the discussion about Nash has gone.</LD>
<LD>   As we move closer to Oscar night on March 24, some journalists
have taken material they claim is in the book on which the film is
based, distorted it and invented "facts" about Nash and his wife,
Alicia. Mainstream news organizations have stated everything from the
"fact" that Nash was gay and an adulterer to the "fact" that he was a
bad father and a bigot--all of which are untrue.</LD>
<LD>   I have been an economics reporter for almost 20 years. I spent 2
1/2 years on leave from the New York Times, interviewing hundreds of
people who knew Nash and then writing about his life as carefully and
completely as I knew how. Now, I'd like to correct the record.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to the Times of London's references to Nash's "numerous
homosexual liaisons," Nash is not gay. While he had intense emotional
relationships with other men in his 20s, no one I interviewed
claimed, much less provided evidence, that Nash ever had sex with
another man. True, Nash was arrested in a police trap in a men's room
in Santa Monica in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy era. Rand
Corp., where he was working, stripped him of his security clearance
and fired him, ignoring Nash's complete denial and saying it didn't
matter whether the police were telling the truth or not. The
charge--"indecent exposure"--was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Associated Press and the Hollywood Reporter have alluded
to "Nash's adultery." The book makes clear that his affair with the
mother of his older son was over by the time he married Alicia Larde.
Entertainment Weekly claimed that Nash and his wife were "separated
for nearly 40 years." The New York Times implied that as well.
Actually, they were divorced in 1963, but by the time they remarried
last June, they had been living together for 38 years, many of which
were years of poverty and illness.</TE>
<TE>   The Times of London suggested that their decision to remarry was
made "for cynical movie-marketing purposes." In the epilogue of the
new paperback edition, I quote the Nashes on their wedding day. "The
divorce shouldn't have happened; we saw this as a kind of retraction
of that," John Nash said. "After all, we've been together most of our
lives," Alicia Nash said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, moreover, Nash has cared for his younger son, who has
suffered from schizophrenia. Indeed, Nash's reason for going forward
with the movie was to be able to provide for Alicia and his two adult
sons.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Post, quoting a letter Nash wrote in 1967, calls Nash
a "rabid anti-Semite." Here are the facts: In his 20s, Nash's most
ardent champions in the mathematics community were Norbert Wiener,
Solomon Lefschetz and Norman Levinson, all victims of anti-Semitism
in American universities in the 1930s and '40s. In recent years, his
most prominent supporter has been Ariel Rubinstein at Tel Aviv
University, winner of the Israel Prize. The letter the Post quotes
was written eight years after Nash was diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia, when he not only felt himself threatened by Jews and
the state of Israel but also believed himself to be Job, a slave in
chains, the emperor of Antarctica and a messiah living, not in his
mother's home in Roanoke, Va., but in hell, refugee camps, bomb
shelters and prisons. These were signs of paranoid delusions.</TE>
<TE>   As I explained to the students at Columbia, Nash is no more
perfect than you or I. The point of "A Beautiful Mind" was not, as
Entertainment Weekly concluded, "that what was beautiful about John
Nash was the mind rather than the man," but rather the opposite. As
an academic reviewer of the book pointed out in 1998, before the
current intense media focus on the film, "Nasar reminds the reader
again and again ... that Nash was a majestic person despite his
flaws."</TE>

<HD>LAUSD Flunks Good Sense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motivated, perhaps, by ongoing outcry that Los Angeles' public
schools are too often an insult to the idea of serious education, the
teachers at Pacific Palisades Charter High School want to flunk
students who don't show up for class. In their grade books, six
unexcused absences in one semester rate an F.</LD>
<LD>   So what does the Los Angeles Unified School District do upon
hearing that some of its teachers take their job so seriously as to
impose this sensible standard? It slaps them down, of course, citing
that bane of all innovation in public education, "district
policy"--which in this case allows students who miss class to make up
the work and pass.</LD>
<LD>   This approach makes sense for students who suffer from chronic
illnesses. But if kids can routinely ditch class without a legitimate
excuse and without academic consequences, why not let them "phone it
in"? The LAUSD's policy suggests that nothing valuable is going on in
the classroom, and it doesn't matter if a student attends class or
not as long as the assignment gets done. Bad thinking. Robert
Balfanz, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, has found that
simply getting students to show up engages them more fully in their
education and increases their chances of graduating.</LD>
<TE>   Responsible parents make sure that their kids are seated at a desk
each school day unless they're too sick. They use thermometers to
flush out fakers. Others will let their  youngsters skip  classes
when the surf's up and then cook up excuses for their darlings.
Neither teachers nor other students should have to put up with the
disruption such mollycoddling causes. All the standardized testing,
teacher training and textbook investment mean nothing if students
don't have to show up for class.</TE>
<TE>   Palisades is a charter school and can make its own rules, but they
must be approved by the Los Angeles school board because the campus
remains a part of the LAUSD system. The principal and teachers
believed that their no-nonsense attendance policy had been approved
in their application for charter status. District administrators say
it wasn't, and add that the school can fix that by submitting an
amendment that would have to be approved by the school board.
Meanwhile, Palisades teachers who flunk students for missing too many
classes face discipline.</TE>
<TE>   This mess, first reported by Times staff writer Solomon Moore,
should encourage the Palisades leadership to break from the LAUSD,
becoming an independent charter school,   freed  from district and
state regulations in exchange for proving that its students are
receiving a good education.</TE>
<TE>   At the Accelerated School in South-Central Los Angeles, for
example, students who are tardy or absent 17 times, roughly one-tenth
of the school year, are not invited back. They have a choice: Line up
with 1,200 other students waiting for admission or go to another
school.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study on low-income students released Monday by Cal
State L.A., independent charter schools get better results than their
bureaucracy-constrained counterparts. Isn't that the point of
education?</TE>
<TE>   Rules with teeth, like those at Pacific Palisades, are key to a
school's success. Since the LAUSD feels compelled to butt in, it
should promptly change district policy and demand that all schools
crack down on ditchers.</TE>

<LD>Mexico's drug gangs have become staggeringly violent, even
slaughtering children if they get in the way of their criminal trade.
President Bush applauded the news last week that Mexican authorities
had beheaded that nation's most brutal drug cartel. Now let's hope he
recognizes that the body count on both sides of the border will
quickly rebound unless the United States gets equally tough in
attacking the demand for the products that cause such mayhem to
flourish.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprisingly smooth operation in Puebla, near Mexico City,
soldiers captured Benjamin Arellano Felix, the reputed brain of the
infamous organization bearing the family name. Police say that a
month earlier they killed one of his younger brothers, Ramon, the
cartel's top enforcer (DNA tests are expected to confirm the dead
man's identity). As a result, a fearsome drug empire, which spread to
at least 15 Mexican states and across the border by air, sea, land
and even underground tunnels, is writhing like a rattlesnake that's
been whacked with a machete.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, narcotics trafficking operations are like serpents
with magical powers of regeneration. Demand keeps the beasts alive.
Yet in the United States, only four cents of every dollar spent
fighting drugs goes to prevention and treatment. Approximately 5
million people consume an estimated 75% of all the heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines that come from abroad. According to experts, these
hard-core users are disproportionately poor and unemployed and
account for most of the crime, child abuse, overdose deaths and other
most serious consequences of drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Interning addicts in residential rehabilitation programs is just
one way to help break the supply-and-demand connection--and a
relatively cheap adjunct to fighting Mexican drug lords while
incarcerating U.S. addicts.</TE>
<TE>   As important as it is, the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix just
adds another prisoner to a long list of drug lords imprisoned since
police captured Rafael Caro Quintero in 1985. In fact, Benjamin is
now jailed alongside his brother Francisco, captured in 1993. If the
United States really wants to win the war on drugs it must hit the
cartels where it hurts, cutting the heart out of the profit motive.</TE>

<LD>Sept. 11 blew to bits any illusions Americans might have harbored
that the danger of devastating attacks on this nation ended with the
Cold War. The Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review, disclosed this past
weekend in The Times, should give pause to any enemy who harbors
illusions that post-Cold War retaliation against such attacks would
automatically preclude the use of nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Good. Hard though nuclear counterattack would be to deliver, the
free world will be safer if terrorists and rogue states understand
that if they kill millions with smallpox or anthrax they may face the
United States' ultimate weapon. That said, there are aspects of the
nuclear plan that Bush should publicly disavow--or Congress
aggressively challenge: the apparent lowering of the threshold for
using nuclear weapons and the blurring of lines between nuclear and
conventional weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Nuclear weapons are not just new and improved versions of
conventional armaments. They are different in kind from the weapons
used on Dresden, Pearl Harbor and Tora Bora. They are so powerful, so
awesome, that they have been wielded only twice, in August of 1945.</LD>
<TE>   The Pentagon's proposed policy suggests new uses for new types of
nuclear weapons: "bunker-busters" that can penetrate deep underground
to destroy the hide-outs of dictators or storerooms of chemical and
biological agents, while releasing relatively low levels of radiation
and thereby reducing damage in the region. Developing such weapons
would be a dangerous, unacceptable step toward the nuclear brink.
Testing such weapons would be dreadful for the world's health and
political balance. The United States has an overwhelming superiority
in conventional weapons; in addition it still maintains many
thousands of nuclear weapons to deter foes and reassure allies. It
has no need for new versions.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon review understandably puts North Korea, Iraq, Iran,
Syria and Libya on a list of real or potential foes. The list
includes Russia and China, despite their improved relations with
Washington since the launching of the war on terror. The report
suggests that nuclear weapons could be used in the event of
"surprising military developments," a term so vague as to imply a
launch-at-will concept rather than the proper policy: as the last
resort of a nation faced with annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have defended the Pentagon proposals
as prudent military planning. It is true that planning is necessary,
but merging nuclear and nonnuclear systems as part of the planning
could encourage other nations to step up development of their own
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, J. Robert Oppenheimer watched the detonation of America's
first atomic weapon, which he helped build, and recalled the lines
from the Hindu epic Bhagavad-Gita: "Now I have become Death,
destroyer of worlds." His horror is worth remembering.</TE>

<HD>Aftermath of 9/11: Airport Searches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was incensed by your two front-page articles: "U.S. Gets Back to
Normal" and "Public's Anger Simmers Over Airport Searches" (March
11).</LD>
<LD>   It has been six months since the attacks and the U.S. is not back
to normal. Let's remember that we are thousands of miles away from
ground zero and the Pentagon. We are thousands of miles away from the
suburbs of New York, where American flags are displayed proudly on
almost every door and car in towns where at least one person died on
Sept. 11. We are thousands of miles away from a gaping hole in the
New York City skyline. We are thousands of miles away from watching
New Yorkers jump at the sound of an ambulance siren. Out of sight,
out of mind. But we are not back to normal.</LD>
<LD>   Airport security checks are without a doubt time-consuming and
somewhat invasive, but they are a necessary component of security, no
matter what your age or status. I saw a well-known celebrity pulled
aside in Minneapolis last week. He watched the security staff search
his bags with patience and understanding. Nothing exempts any of us
from a security check. If you don't agree, do us all a favor and stay
home.</LD>

<TE>   I acknowledge that there may be airport security employees stupid
enough to believe that a Medal of Honor (shaped like a star) carried
by the retired general who earned it could be used as a weapon. But
what is the rationale for calling me aside (time after time) to
examine my briefcase and wallet because I carry coins?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I have quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies in the change
compartment of my wallet, inside my briefcase. Each time the security
employee, after sticking a gloved finger through my change
compartment, observes, "You have coins here." I respond brightly,
"Yes, that's my wallet." This occurs even when I take out most of the
coins before heading for the airport. What makes U.S. coins suspect?</TE>

<TE>   The Horrigans and others like them need to chill out. So what if
their 3-year-old was searched? It is not out of the realm of
possibility to put something on a child to get through security.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Burbank Airport I had removed all my metal
objects--jewelry, watch, etc.--or so I thought. I set off the first
sensor. Then I was body-scanned with the wand.</TE>
<TE>   The underwire on my bra was the culprit. My first thought was that
a partial strip search was imminent but, most important, did I have
on presentable underwear? There was no strip search. Note to self:
Wear bras without underwires (you can look perky later) and never,
never wear scruffy underwear through security.</TE>
<TE>   Quit complaining--we need the security, and if you get searched,
it makes a good story.</TE>

<HD>Averting a Crisis in Social Security</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Social Security is a system in crisis. While today there are enough
taxes coming in to pay current benefits, a little more than a decade
from now that won't be the case.</LD>
<LD>   The only way to save Social Security for generations to come, and
give all Americans a better deal on their payroll tax dollar, is to
enact individually owned and controlled personal retirement accounts.
Current retirees have put decades of trust in Social Security, and
any reform should not affect them. However, younger workers need the
power of compound interest that only private capital markets can
provide.</LD>
<LD>   Some politicians try to scare seniors by saying that PRAs will
mean a cut in benefits; nothing could be further from the truth. PRAs
ensure that Social Security will be around for decades to come and
that the draconian payroll tax hikes or benefits cuts that will be
needed without reform can be averted.</LD>

that what our president says he's doing seems to count for far more
than what he actually does.</LD>
<LD>   But, of course, the architects of both the administration's
strategy and that of the Enron Corp. are one and the same--savvy
public relations folks capitalizing on the old magician's sleight of

<HD>Seizure of Farms in Mugabe's Zimbabwe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Resettled and Happy in Zimbabwe," March 9: Ann Simmons and The
Times produced a dainty piece of propaganda for the Mugabe thugocracy
of Zimbabwe.</LD>
<LD>   We are apparently expected to glow with satisfaction on reading of
the happy and prosperous black farmers who have seized the land and
the success of the white farmers. Simmons even interviewed one of
these happy new owners. One hopes for at least a few successes in the
unfolding tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Land "reform" is not new to Zimbabwe. Farms have been taken from
white farmers in the past for "redistribution" to the black
population. Many of those previously prosperous farms are now
comparative wastelands. The international aid community knows that
famine is pending in Zimbabwe, and it is preparing to ask the West
for food for yet another failed African state. In other words, having
murdered or ejected the successful white farmers, Zimbabwe will now
come to the white farmers of Europe, Canada and the U.S. to replace
what has been brutally destroyed. It should be turned down.</LD>
<TE>   Rachelle Young</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article was nothing more than a celebration of ethnic
cleansing. It examined Zimbabwe's resettlement program, in which
white Zimbabweans have had their land and property forcibly
confiscated because of the color of their skin. Those who resist are
beaten and, in some cases, killed.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons concentrated on how happy many black Zimbabweans are with
dictator Robert Mugabe's resettlement scheme. She managed to write
her entire article without quoting anyone who questions the morality
of seizing land because of skin color.</TE>
<TE>   What Mugabe is doing is no different than what Slobodan Milosevic
did when he tried to cleanse Serbian territory of Muslims, who, he
claimed, were the descendants of foreign invaders who had stolen
Serbian land. Milosevic is justifiably on trial for the crime of
ethnic cleansing. Imagine an article in The Times in which Christian
Serbs were interviewed about how happy they were that the Muslims
were gone, with no Muslims quoted for balance.</TE>
<TE>   If ethnic cleansing is a crime, it should be a crime no matter the
skin color of the perpetrators. The press should not play racial
favorites. A crime is a crime.</TE>

<LD>Re "School Board Poised to Revive Abandoned Belmont Project," March
11: It seems that while LAUSD Supt. Roy Romer is trying his best to
convince us that Belmont is safe for everyone, I would feel a lot
more confident and willing to go along with his ideas if they would
move the board meetings and offices to the new high school site.</LD>
<LD>   Think of all the money that would be saved if the offices were
moved there. Action speaks volumes, and if it's safe enough for kids
and teachers, surely it's safe enough for the administrative offices
of our school system.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Let the School Bell Ring at the Belmont Complex," Voices,
March 9: I'm confused. According to Rafael Gonzalez, the Belmont
controversy is about students needing classrooms. But I thought the
controversy was about toxic hazards and possible criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont community is no more overcrowded than many other of
the LAUSD's inner-city neighborhoods. To say we should finish Belmont
because the area is overcrowded is to confuse the priority of issues.
Yes, these kids need a new school, but such a need is not unique in
this city and is certainly no justification for risking public
health.</TE>

<LD>Re "Suicide Bomber Kills 12 at Busy Jerusalem Cafe," March 10: After
summarizing the violence in that part of the world, The Times stated
that the Palestinian attacks were in revenge for the ongoing Israeli
military offensive. In reality, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak offered Yasser Arafat 97% of what he was asking for. When that
offer was refused, the wave of Palestinian terror began and has been
constantly increasing, the victims being innocent civilians. Israel's
retaliation has been in response to the escalating terrorism. I am
not condoning the violence on either side. I am asking for an
accurate recounting of the recent history in that war-torn region.</LD>

<TE>   Overrunning another country from impregnable bases in tanks,
crushing houses, Apache copters killing car-crammed children with

the same ugly name, terrorism, or not use it at all. Parallax, seeing

<TE>   The photo of an Israeli soldier herding Palestinians with "U.S."

wealth and arms that is allowing this occupation and madness to
continue. It makes no sense to be sending one-third of all our
foreign aid to the Middle East so that Israel can bomb schools and
civilians. Think how different today would be if for the past 35
years our aid had been used to build schools and hospitals instead of
settlements and bypass roads. Enough is enough. If Israelis want to
continue this madness, let them do it on their dime, not ours.</TE>

<LD>Is Zev Yaroslavsky the only county supervisor with an ounce of
integrity ("Board Secretly Urged Killing Ballot Item," March 8)? Who
elected these people and who has oversight of them? Taking money away

supervisors didn't even have the guts to fight fairly--they had to

Supervisor Gloria Molina and company should resign en masse

<HD>James Tobin, 84; Leading Economist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Tobin, a leading American economist who was awarded the 1981
Nobel Prize in economics for his work on the portfolio selection
theory, which analyzed changes in financial markets and their impact
on the spending and investing habits of individuals and businesses,
has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Tobin, who once summed up his theory as, "Don't put your eggs in
one basket," died Monday at a hospital in New Haven, Conn., of
complications from a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   The Sterling Professor Emeritus of Economics at Yale, Tobin also
served on President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors.</LD>
<TE>   But his greatest legacy may be his focus on how economic policies
affected people's lives. He believed that the government could use
fiscal and monetary measures to benefit society.</TE>
<TE>   He was described by fellow Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson as "the
archetype of a late-20th century American scholar."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Champaign, Ill., Tobin was a child of the Depression. His
mother was a social worker and his father a sports information
director for the University of Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   After winning an academic scholarship to Harvard in 1935, Tobin
began studying economics. As an undergraduate student, he was
introduced to the theories of the British economist John Maynard
Keynes, whose then newly published book "The General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money," advocating governmental intervention
in the economy, would become a major influence on Tobin's work.</TE>
<TE>   He later explained how he became interested in economics.</TE>
<TE>   "Economics has the virtue that it combines two things. One is that
it's an intellectually challenging subject to work in, particularly
for people who have mathematical, quantitative aptitudes, talents and
interests," Tobin told a reporter. "Second, it has a lot of social
relevance and real world importance. That combination was
particularly appealing for someone like me in the late 1930s."</TE>
<TE>   Tobin earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Harvard, leaving
in 1940 for government service, first in the Office of Price
Administration in Washington, D.C., and then the Civilian Supply and
War Production Board.</TE>
<TE>   After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the Navy and met
novelist Herman Wouk at the Navy officers training program at
Columbia University. In his book "The Caine Mutiny," Wouk
immortalized his friend as the character Tobit, a midshipman with "a
mind like a sponge ... ahead of the field by a spacious percentage."</TE>
<TE>   After serving four years on the destroyer Kearny in the Atlantic
and Mediterranean, Tobin ended his naval duty as executive officer of
the ship.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin returned to Harvard after the war, earning his doctorate in
1947, and stayed on as a junior fellow.</TE>
<TE>   He left in 1950 to join the Yale faculty as an associate professor
of economics. He was promoted to full professor in 1955 and was named
the Sterling Professor of Economics in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin's early work came to the attention of President-elect
Kennedy. When selected for the Council of Economic Advisors, Tobin
initially resisted, calling himself "an ivory tower economist."</TE>
<TE>   "That's all right, professor," Kennedy was said to have replied,
"I am what you call an ivory tower president."</TE>
<TE>   A report Tobin wrote with two members of the council would be the
subject of public debate for decades. Council members recommended
goals of full employment, greater competition, stiffer enforcement of
antitrust legislation and more investment in science and technology
education and training.</TE>
<TE>   After a year and a half in the Kennedy administration, Tobin
returned to Yale.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he espoused the "negative income tax" as a method to
achieve income redistribution while maintaining incentives to work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, he joined Sen. George S. McGovern's campaign for the
presidency as an advisor on economic reform.</TE>
<TE>   That year, Tobin and Bill Nordhaus constructed a Measure of
Economic Welfare for the American economy, which adjusted the
conventional measurement of the gross national product. Tobin also
introduced "Tobin's q" as a way to predict whether capital investment
would increase or decrease.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Tobin was harshly critical of the supply-side theory
of economics then in vogue, saying that it consisted of "half-baked
proposals."</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, the Royal Swedish Academy of Science presented him with a
Nobel Prize, citing his "creative and extensive work on the analysis
of financial markets and their relations to expenditure decisions,
employment, production and prices."</TE>
<TE>   The academy noted, "Unlike many other theorists in the field,
Tobin does not confine his analysis solely to money, but considers
the entire range of assets and debts.... Few economic researchers of
today could be said to have gained so many followers or asserted such
influence on contemporary research."</TE>
<TE>   Tobin, who retired in 1988, was the author of dozens of books and
hundreds of articles.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, four children and three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Irene Worth, 85; Actress Was 3-Time Tony Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irene Worth, one of the great leading ladies of the English-speaking
stage and a three-time Tony Award winner, died Sunday in New York at
the age of 85.</LD>
<LD>   The actress suffered a stroke Friday while at a Manhattan post
office and died at Roosevelt Hospital, according to her sister, Carol
Johnson of Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Worth won her best actress Tony awards for creating the title role
in Edward Albee's "Tiny Alice" in 1965 and as Alexandra del Lago in a
revival of Tennessee Williams' "Sweet Bird of Youth" in 1976. She
received the Tony for best featured actress in 1991 for playing the
bitter German immigrant Grandma Kurnitz in the premiere of Neil
Simon's "Lost in Yonkers."</LD>
<TE>   Originally named Harriet Abrams, Worth grew up in California. But
she became a stage star in England, arriving during World War II and
living there for more than three decades, playing great classical
roles on the West End and with such companies as the Old Vic, the
Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. She portrayed
Celia Coplestone in the original staging of "The Cocktail Party,"
T.S. Eliot's primary claim to theatrical fame, in Edinburgh in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and '60s, Worth often crossed the Atlantic to appear
in New York productions. After seeing her in Lillian Hellman's "Toys
in the Attic" in 1960, critic Walter Kerr wrote in the now defunct
New York Herald Tribune that Worth is "an actress to be studied by
all other actresses who would themselves like to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   Director and actor Austin Pendleton told the Washington Post in
1981 that Worth is "one of the three or four great actors in the
English-speaking world. The thing that amazes me about her, to a
greater degree than any other actor, is that she has a powerful
intellect and knows how to make that work for her emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   Her range was wide. She appeared in groundbreaking productions
that were staged by such visionary directors as Peter Brook (Goneril
in "King Lear" in 1962 and Jocasta in "Oedipus" in 1968) and Andrei
Serban (Andreyevna in "The Cherry Orchard" in 1977). She played
Winnie in Samuel Beckett's two-actor "Happy Days" in New York in
1979. But she also was at home in the more traditional environs of
the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Canada, where she starred in
the first season in 1953 and returned in 1959 and 1970.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared in film and television sporadically, winning a
British Film Academy award for "Orders to Kill" in 1958. She
re-created two of her most noted stage roles, Goneril in Brook's
"King Lear" and Grandma Kurnitz in "Lost in Yonkers," in their screen
versions.</TE>
<TE>   But she seldom ventured far from a stage and never moved back to
California to seek Hollywood fame.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet Abrams was born in Fairbury, Neb., in 1916, the daughter
of teachers in nearby Jansen, Neb. Her parents were Mennonites. Her
father was superintendent of the county school system.</TE>
<TE>   In 1920, the family moved to Reedley, Calif., home of a large
Mennonite community in the San Joaquin Valley. Her brother, Luke
Evans of Los Angeles, remembers his sister reciting lines from "Romeo
and Juliet" while she washed the dishes at the age of 12.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to San Luis Obispo in 1928 and to Saticoy, near
Ventura, in 1930, leaving the Mennonite culture behind and joining
mainstream Protestant churches.</TE>
<TE>   Young Harriet started her secondary education at San Luis Obispo
and Ventura high schools, but spent her last two years at Newport
Harbor High School after her family moved to Costa Mesa, where her
father took a superintendent job in 1931. She was president of the
girls' glee club and appeared in "The Mikado" during her senior year,
1933.</TE>
<TE>   She attended Santa Ana Junior College (now Santa Ana College) for
two years and then transferred to UCLA, continuing to appear in
student plays, including "A Bill of Divorcement," "The Children's
Hour" and "Ethan Frome" at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   During her college years, she obtained a small role in a Hollywood
movie, appearing as a courtroom witness with only one line, said her
brother. An RKO director, Alfred Santell, urged her to pursue an
acting career. But her mother was opposed to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   After the would-be actress graduated with an education degree in
1937, she began teaching kindergarten in Santa Ana. "But she became
so fed up with doing what she didn't want to do, she became
physically ill," said her brother.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to New York in 1942, using the stage name Irene
(pronounced I-ree-nee) Worth--which was on a list that had earlier
been submitted to her by a studio executive. She got a job in a road
tour of "Escape Me Never!" A year later she made her Broadway debut
in "The Two Mrs. Carrolls," starring Elisabeth Bergner and Victor
Jory. Worth later credited Bergner with urging her to go to England
for classical training. She studied there with Elsie Fogerty,
beginning in 1944, and made her London debut in "The Time of Your
Life" in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   After decades in London, Worth's accent often sounded English. In
Neil Simon's 1999 memoir "The Play Goes On," he recalled that after
she was cast in "Lost in Yonkers" without an audition, he and
director Gene Saks became concerned that she might not be able to
pull off Grandma Kurnitz's German accent.</TE>
<TE>   They met with Worth for lunch in London and broached the subject
indirectly. But the actress caught on, wrote Simon, and "she looked
at us with a cold, chilling stare" and informed them that she hadn't
auditioned in 42 years. The two men quickly dropped the subject.</TE>
<TE>   She then asked the waiter to bring the dessert cart. When he
wheeled it to the table, she started deliberating out loud--in a
German accent: "Should I haff ze strudel, or perhaps ze apple tart?
Nein. I sink ze chocolate tart looks best, yah? Danke schoen."</TE>
<TE>   "She never looked at us or smiled," Simon wrote. "She was smarter
than all of us. We had our Grandma Kurnitz."</TE>
<TE>   Worth, who never married, is survived by her two siblings.</TE>

<HD>John Challens, 86; Created Firing Circuits for British Atom
Bomb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>John Challens, the scientist who created the electrical firing
circuits that detonated Britain's first atomic bomb, has died at 86,
his family said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Challens collapsed while playing golf in his hometown of
Basingstoke on March 1 and died soon after of a heart-related
illness, his son Bob Challens said.</LD>
<LD>   Challens was one of a group of scientists who worked in secret at
the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, now the
Atomic Weapons Establishment, created in 1950 by Britain's then-Labor
government to develop a nuclear deterrent.</LD>
<TE>   Britain had been forced to go it alone after the United States
stopped all collaboration in the atomic field, limiting Britain's
access to nuclear weapons material and to the knowledge needed to
produce the weapons.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 3, 1952, in the Monte Bello Islands off the northwest
coast of Australia, Challens and another scientist made the final
checks on the bomb, which had been loaded aboard the frigate Plym.
The device was detonated by the electronic firing circuits that he
had invented.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Peterborough in eastern England on May 15, 1915, Challens
studied at University College in Nottingham before joining the War
Office in the 1930s to research the physics of heavy guns.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, he worked on missile guidance systems at the rocket
development establishment at Aberporth in western Wales, and after
World War II he joined the British team that investigated Germany's
V1 and V2 buzz bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Challens was recruited to work on Britain's atomic
project by William Penney, who had worked on the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Challens took part in British nuclear tests in
Australia and later invented an electronic initiator to replace
polonium as a firing agent.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, he became head of development at the Atomic Weapons
Research Establishment, producing new warheads for the Royal Air
Force and Royal Navy. He became deputy director of the agency in
1972, and later helped to modify the Polaris submarine's nuclear
missile system so that it could penetrate Soviet defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Challens is survived by his second wife, Norma, and two sons by
his first marriage.</TE>

<HD>Spyros Kyprianou, 69; Led a Divided Cyprus for 11 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NICOSIA, Cyprus</DL>
<LD>Former President Spyros Kyprianou, a leader of hard-line Greek
Cypriots opposed to the war-divided island's breakaway Turkish state,
died Tuesday at a Nicosia hospital. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Kyprianou, who was hospitalized Saturday, died of pelvic cancer.
He was president for 11 years until 1988 and remained a powerful
voice opposed to concessions to the Turkish Cypriot minority.</LD>
<LD>   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in July
1974 and seized the northern third of the island. The invasion was
prompted by a Greek-backed coup on the island by supporters of union
with Greece.</LD>
<TE>   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf R. Denktash offered his condolences to
Kyprianou's family Tuesday, but made a passing swipe at his old
political foe, saying: "He defended a cause that he believed in, but
it was a cause that did no good to Cyprus."</TE>
<TE>   Kyprianou was born in Limassol, a port and commercial center and
the second-largest town in Cyprus, one of nine children of a
prosperous businessman.</TE>
<TE>   He studied economics and commerce at the City of London College
and law at Gray's Inn before returning to Cyprus, where he became the
protege of the island's first post-independence president, Archbishop
Makarios.</TE>
<TE>   Makarios chose the 28-year-old former law student as foreign
minister when the island gained independence from Britain in 1960.
But Kyprianou was forced to resign in 1972 after a disagreement with
the then-ruling Greek junta.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1974, national guard troops, led by officers from mainland
Greece, launched a coup that toppled Makarios and set up a government
aimed at joining Greece. Within days, Turkey--opposed to any
union--sent troops to invade in a bid to remove the new government.</TE>
<TE>   The next month, the junta ruling Greece fell, replaced by a
democratic government, and the Cyprus coup collapsed. Makarios was
restored, and the Turkish military held 37% of the island.</TE>
<TE>   Makarios called back Kyprianou, who had opposed the coup and
resisted Greek mainland influence on the island. Kyprianou was named
an advisor and a member of the Cypriot delegation to the United
Nations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976 elections, Kyprianou became president of the Cypriot
parliament, and when Makarios died in 1977, he was elected to serve
the last few months of the archbishop's five-year presidential term.
Kyprianou was reelected unopposed in January 1978.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1979, Kyprianou and Denktash agreed on a 10-point agenda
for a peace settlement based on Cyprus' becoming a two-zone federal
state. But talks to negotiate the details broke down.</TE>
<TE>   Kyprianou was reelected to another five-year term in February
1983. In November of that year, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Only Turkey recognized the
breakaway entity.</TE>
<TE>   Kyprianou and Denktash met in January 1985, but no progress was
made, and three years later Kyprianou lost in presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   Kyprianou is survived by his wife and two sons.</TE>
<TE>   A state funeral will be held in Nicosia, on Thursday.</TE>

<LD>John A. Blume, 92, considered the "Father of Earthquake Engineering"
for his pioneering advances in designing quake-safe buildings, died
March 1 at his home in Hillsborough, Calif. No specific cause of
death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Blume, born in the small town of Gonzales, Calif., grew up
observing problems with structures in the quake-prone state. His
father, a construction worker, helped rebuild such San Francisco
landmarks as the Palace Hotel and City Hall after the devastating
1906 earthquake and fire.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating from Stanford University, Blume worked as a
construction engineer on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the
mid-1930s. He founded his own civil engineering firm based in San
Francisco in 1945, and nearly two decades later returned to Stanford
to earn his doctorate. He founded the John A. Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center at Stanford in 1974 and worked to make the
university a leading institution in earthquake engineering.</LD>

<LD>Laura Cameron Fraser, 70, the first woman to be ordained as an
Episcopal priest in the Pacific Northwest, died March 2 of a stroke
at her home in East Wenatchee, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   She was ordained Feb. 3, 1977, before a capacity crowd at Epiphany
Parish in Olympia. Her elevation to the priesthood was controversial,
provoking 26 of Washington's Episcopal clergy and laypeople who
opposed the ordination of women to hold an opposition prayer service.</LD>
<LD>   After spending several years as rector of a church in Issaquah,
Wash., she was engulfed by controversy again when she publicly
acknowledged her belief in channeling, a process thought by some to
bring the living into contact with spirits.</LD>
<TE>   The local bishop ordered her to repudiate her belief in
channeling. Fraser refused and left the church.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, she helped establish the Foundation for Inner
Enlightenment and Spiritual Freedom, which provided counseling,
spiritual development classes and experimental worship services.</TE>

<LD>The number of people without health insurance in California fell to
6.2 million last year, a drop of about 375,000 from 1998, the UCLA
Center for Health Policy Research said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers attributed the decline to the strong economy and low
unemployment in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   E. Richard Brown, director of the UCLA center, said the current
recession may have erased those gains, but it's too early to tell.
Also, the rising cost of health care "will dampen the positive trend
that we've seen," he said.</LD>

leader Malcolm X.</LD>
<LD>   Butterfields will not go ahead with the March 20 sale because it

<LD>   Gary Lee Morris, 60, who had operated a construction business

Monday that he hid thousands of dollars in several bank accounts and
faked his accounting records for tax years 1994 and 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Morris, who was released from custody on his promise to return to
court, concealed the money to keep Bankruptcy Court from seizing it,
prosecutors said.</LD>

prospective athletes.</LD>
<LD>   "Notre Dame High School has committed to ensure that another
occurrence of this type will not take place," Jim Staunton, Southern
Section commissioner, said Tuesday in a press release. "It is the
feeling of the section that the administration and the diocese has
built-in safeguards that are satisfactory."</LD>
<LD>   As part of the control measures instituted by the diocese and
school officials, football Coach and Athletic Director Hal Pfeiffer
will be fired.</LD>
<TE>   Pfeiffer, who had been placed on paid administrative leave during
the investigation, was videotaped during a meeting in February with a
group of parents from other schools.</TE>
<TE>   He allegedly offered to help find ways to pay the cost of tuition
if the parents had their sons enroll at Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Tuesday by the diocese, the following
safeguards will be implemented:</TE>
<TE>   * A new football coaching staff will be in place for the upcoming
season.</TE>
<TE>   * No person can serve as athletic director and coach concurrently.</TE>
<TE>   * No parents can serve as walk-on coaches for the football team.</TE>
<TE>   * A representative of the school administration will be assigned
to the athletic booster club.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bellinger Knows About Winning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>Phoenix</DL>
<LD>PHOENIX--We're all still waiting for that first World Series
championship parade in Anaheim, but for now the Angels can gather
round Clay Bellinger's locker and listen.</LD>
<LD>   "Here in Arizona, guys will tell you they were in a World Series
parade last year, but that's not the same as a parade in New York,"
Bellinger said Tuesday. "Three-and-a-half million people, there's
people throwing things out of buildings 30 stories up, stuff you
can't describe unless you're there. It's unbelievable."</LD>
<LD>   Bellinger, 33, trying to beat out Jeff DaVanon, Jose Nieves and
Jamie Burke for the Angels' last bench spot, was a utility player for
the New York Yankees the last three seasons. When center fielder
Bernie Williams caught the final out of the 2000 World Series,
Bellinger was in left field.</LD>
<TE>   When the Yankees released him, Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman
called, looking for someone who could play anywhere, play sparingly
and be happy about it. That description fit Bellinger perfectly. He
played every position except pitcher and catcher for the Yankees, he
endured six triple-A seasons and he is enormously proud of his two
World Series championship rings, no matter how limited his
contributions to winning them.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't give rings to nine guys," he said. "You give rings to
25 guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every day, David Eckstein works out with the Angels. Every night,
Eckstein goes home, where he can hear his roommate tell him how the
Oakland Athletics can whip the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein is sharing a Scottsdale, Ariz., apartment this spring
with Mark Ellis, who is trying to make the Oakland roster as a
utility infielder. They were teammates at the University of
Florida--Eckstein was the second baseman, Ellis the shortstop--and
beneath all the kidding Ellis takes heart in the example set by his
roommate. Eckstein wasn't supposed to make the Angel roster last
spring, got his chance when Adam Kennedy got hurt, and hasn't seen
the minor leagues since.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone always doubted him," Ellis said. "No one even thought he
would be drafted. Now he's a starting shortstop in the big leagues."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz pitched four shutout innings and struck out four in a
4-3 loss to Oakland. "Everybody says, 'Spring training, I don't
care.' I care," Ortiz said. "I don't like people hitting home runs
off me." ... Matt Wise, who lost his spot in the starting rotation
when the Angels acquired Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele in December,
made his first relief appearance of the spring. The Angels will give
Wise a shot at a bullpen job but figure to return him to triple-A
Salt Lake City as a starter....Nathan Haynes, the top-ranked outfield
prospect in the organization, is expected to sit out the next four
months following surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left thumb.
Haynes was injured when he slipped running the bases in an exhibition
game last week.</TE>

<HD>Rivera Released After Accusations of Theft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A baseball player's locker is a sacred place--one private place in
his very public world. Ruben Rivera learned that invading that
sanctum can be a very serious offense.</LD>
<LD>   Once one of the most promising prospects in baseball, Rivera was
put on unconditional release waivers by the New York Yankees after
being accused of taking a bat and glove from teammate Derek Jeter's
locker.</LD>
<LD>   "That type of thing is a shock," Manager Joe Torre said Tuesday.
"It's sad. It's unfortunate."</LD>
<TE>   None of the Yankee players or officials would publicly say why
Rivera was cut. But a baseball lawyer familiar with the decision,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rivera took the equipment
from Jeter's locker and sold it to a sports memorabilia agent.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera later returned the glove and bat, which he reportedly sold
for $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   He signed a $1-million, one-year guaranteed contract with the
Yankees last month, but the team negotiated a $200,000 settlement
Monday, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera refused to comment on Monday night before leaving the team
and his agents also declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball management is putting restrictions on the debt teams can
take on, a move that could provoke an angry response from the
players' union or even force trades of high-salaried stars.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig, in a March 7 letter sent to teams, said
they have until June to get in compliance with the rules, which say a
team can't have debt higher than 40% of its asset value.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason it wasn't enforced for a while was the economic
fallout from the 1995 strike," Selig said Tuesday night. "I wrote
this rule in 1975. I'm the father of the rule. The clubs have known
for a long time that I was going to enforce it."</TE>
<TE>   The union is concerned that restrictions on debt could lower the
amount of money teams have to spend on player salaries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub President Andy MacPhail was selected by Selig to join
management's labor bargaining committee.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said he will add another team official to the negotiating
committee within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   McPhail's father, former American League president Lee MacPhail,
was the owners' chief negotiator during the 1995 labor talks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Jeff Shaw has decided to stay retired rather than
sign a contract with the Cubs, who had been looking to replace
injured closer Tom Gordon.... Left-hander Rick Ankiel won't pitch in
a game again until at least next week because of elbow tendinitis,
jeopardizing his chances of making the St. Louis Cardinals'
opening-day roster.... Former Dodger Tommy John was hired by the
Montreal Expos to be the pitching coach at double-A Harrisburg. Expo
General Manager Omar Minaya also made his first trade, acquiring
third baseman Chris Truby from the Houston Astros for infielder Geoff
Blum.... The San Diego Padres purchased outfielder Ron Gant's
contract and added him to the 40-man roster.... Left-hander reliever
Chuck McElroy, 34, was released by the Astros.</TE>

<HD>Kresse Retires From Charleston</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Kresse, 560-143 in 23 seasons as basketball coach at the College
of Charleston, announced his retirement Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Kresse, who has two years remaining on a 10-year contract, will
become an assistant to college President Lee Higdon.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew that my father was a butcher all his life, and I did not
want to be a coach for all my days," Kresse said. "I wanted to try to
do something else that would be beneficial for the college and
exciting for me."</LD>
<TE>   Kresse, 58, is a native of New York who won a national
championship when the College of Charleston was an NAIA school in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   The college moved to NCAA Division I in the early 1990s and, since
then, Kresse's teams have gone to the NCAA tournament four times and
the NIT twice.</TE>
<TE>   His teams have won 20 or more games in each of the last nine
seasons and, during the 1998-99 season, the Cougars became the first
team to go undefeated in the Southern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Charleston was 21-9, but the Cougars were only 9-7 in
league play and, for a third consecutive season, did not receive an
invitation to a postseason tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh point guard Brandin Knight didn't practice Tuesday as
the Panthers began preparing for Friday's NCAA first-round tournament
game against Central Connecticut State.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is listed as day-to-day after straining his right
quadriceps during Pitt's 74-65 double-overtime loss Saturday to
Connecticut in the Big East Conference championship game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Wiel resigned as Middle Tennessee's coach after a 14-15
season and 84-90 mark in six seasons at the school.</TE>

(21-11) used an 18-1 run to pull away for a 98-92 victory over South
Florida (19-13) in an opening-round game at Muncie, Ind. Theron Smith
had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Cardinals.... Jameer Nelson
shot 11 for 12 from the free-throw line in the last four minutes and
finished with 28 points to lead Saint Joseph's (19-11) to a 73-64
opening-round victory over George Mason (19-10) at Fairfax, Va....
Pete Conway made six three-point baskets and scored a career-high 23
points as Montana State (20-8) held on for a 77-69 opening-round
victory over Utah State (23-8) at Logan, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Reece Gaines banked in a jumper with 5.3 seconds left and scored
23 points to send Louisville (19-12) to a 66-65 first-round victory
over Princeton (16-12) at Louisville, Ky.... Dalron Johnson scored 26
points and Marcus Banks had 23 to lead Nevada Las Vegas (21-10) to a

<LD>John McGrath in the Tacoma News Tribune: "Best Reason To Be Thankful
That Bob Gibson and Nolan Ryan No Longer Are Pitching: Giants
outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, a Japanese import who wears a bright red
glove and adorns both arms with orange wristbands, would have been a
beanball target by the feisty old-schoolers.</LD>
<LD>   "They were known to dust batters who approached the plate with
their jerseys improperly tucked inside their pants."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Which are the two teams with 13 or more losses to
advance to the men's Final Four?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stick to jeans: New Astro Manager Jimy Williams upstaged General
Manager Gerry Hunsicker by wearing a tuxedo to the Houston baseball
writers dinner, which is not a black-tie affair.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hunsicker: "I wasn't that upset because the tux looked like
Jimy had slept in it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ugh! From Bud Geracie of the San Jose Mercury News: "Another
scantily clad, voluptuous body adorns the cover of Sports Illustrated
this week, except this time it's Charles Barkley."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unusual punishment: Billy Donovan's Florida team, once ranked No.
2 in the nation, did not finish well. The Gators were eliminated
early from the Southeastern Conference tournament. But rather than
quickly heading home, the Gators had to stick around for another day
to watch fast-finishing Mississippi State play.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to realize," Donovan said, "that if they play next
week [in the NCAA tournament] like they did [Friday] night, this is
what they'll be doing--sitting in the stands and watching."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He won't change: Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas Morning News wrote
this verse on the Minnesota Vikings' new coach: "So Mike Tice issues
a promise/Randy Moss, no more dogtrots/Perhaps new coach should
research/A leopard and its spots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get it? Peter Vecsey in the New York Post: "Hershey [Pa.] kisses
to the 40th anniversary [March 2] of Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point
game. To commemorate, all home teams were instructed to let the first
20,000 women in free."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atta boy, Del: Jim Armstrong of the Denver Post said that during a
recent Maverick-Nugget game, Dallas owner Mark Cuban was screaming at
Don Nelson's assistant, Del Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "Del! Del!" yelled Cuban. "Tell them to foul Donnell [Harvey]!"</TE>
<TE>   Replied Harris: "Go out there and foul him yourself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Armstrong: "So Giant second baseman Jeff Kent sustained a
broken wrist while washing his truck. At least he wasn't doing
something really dangerous like, say, brushing his teeth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1964, UCLA defeated Seattle, 95-90,
in a first-round NCAA West Regional game in Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins went on to win their first NCAA championship by
defeating Duke, 98-83, in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: North Carolina and Wisconsin had 22-13 records at

<LD>At one point, they had a 3-14 road record, but the Clippers got their
act together at the right time. In their last 16 games away from
Staples Center, they are a creditable 9-7.</LD>
<LD>   "We were horrible to start with on the road," Coach Alvin Gentry
said after the Clippers' victory Monday over the Minnesota
Timberwolves had given them a 3-1 mark on their four-game trip. "I
knew we could turn it around. It was all a matter of gaining
confidence."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers' four longest trips this season were after Jan. 1,
during a period when they played 25 of 35 on the road. They finished
that stretch with an 18-17 record.</LD>
<TE>   After going 1-5 on a six-game trip, the Clippers improved to 3-4
on a seven-game trip and then 3-2 on a five-game trek before their
big breakthrough on their just-completed journey.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry's Final Four picks: Kansas, Cincinnati, Duke and "some
sleeper team." When it was pointed out that by picking Duke, Gentry
was passing over USC, he shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Henry," he said, referring to Trojan Coach Henry Bibby. "I
love what he's done for that program. He's given it so much
respectability. They played great in the tournament last year. But
Duke has too many players."</TE>

<HD>Game Against Expos Has a Far East Flavor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Canadian and U.S. national anthems were played before Tuesday's
exhibition game between the Dodgers and Montreal Expos in Holman
Stadium. They could have played the Japanese national anthem too.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the dozen Japanese players in the major leagues pitched
during a 4-4, 10-inning tie, Hideo Nomo and Kazuhisa Ishii for the
Dodgers and Tomo Ohka for the Expos.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo gave up one run and two hits in four innings and was
extremely efficient, throwing only 39 pitches. Ishii wasn't as sharp
as he was in his exhibition debut against Atlanta last Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The left-hander struggled to control his breaking ball and find
his rhythm in a three-inning, one-run, four-hit stint.</TE>
<TE>   Ohka, a right-hander, threw four shutout innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Ohka looked great, didn't he?" Dodger pitching Coach Jim Colborn
said. "He kind of trumped our Japanese cards a little."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo may not be the ace he was as a Dodger rookie in 1995, but
Colborn will take the hand Nomo dealt Tuesday any time. Nomo threw
first-pitch strikes to eight of 14 batters and induced 10 ground-ball
outs. Of his 39 pitches, 24 were strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been his goal this spring, get ahead of the hitters and
keep the ball down," Colborn said. "It's very pleasing when you see
all those ground-ball outs and a low pitch count. I had the
impression he was a deep-count pitcher, and that's how he got his
[American League-leading 220] strikeouts last year, but that hasn't
been the case this spring."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii had trouble with his nerves, and his control suffered. One
of his warm-up pitches sailed over catcher Paul LoDuca's mitt and hit
a nearby photographer in the side. Although Ishii struck out Orlando
Cabrera looking at a sharp slider to end the sixth, many of his
breaking balls missed the strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Being my first year here, I felt a little excited, I had a lot of
energy," Ishii said through an interpreter. "I wanted to shut down
guys quickly, but I know I can't do that every time. Each time out,
I'm learning to pitch at my own pace, to find my rhythm. LoDuca helps
because he knows my form and can tell me what needs to be corrected."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom hasn't started an exhibition in center field and
has played only five innings there, but Manager Jim Tracy said that
is no indication Grissom has fallen behind McKay Christensen, Dave
Roberts and Tom Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, Tracy has been impressed with Grissom's offensive
approach. Grissom singled in two at-bats Tuesday and is batting .381
(eight for 21) with a double, triple and two runs batted in. "I've
seen Marquis play center field since 1994, and I know how he plays,"
Tracy said. "He's been too good out there for too many years for me
to worry about how many innings I need to play him in center field."</TE>
<TE>   If Grissom wins the center-field job, it presents an interesting
question: Who bats leadoff? Tracy said LoDuca, Mark Grudzielanek and
young shortstop Cesar Izturis would be considered at some point.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm certainly not going to put Izturis in a position to where
we're asking him to take on more of a load at age 22 in the early
part of the season," Tracy said. "I think that's counterproductive to
the development of a young player and I won't do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, slowed because of a sore right hamstring, started
his first exhibition Tuesday, grounding out in his two at-bats. He
ran about three-quarter speed to first but looked good moving
laterally in the field. "They want me to ease into it for a while,"
Grudzielanek said. "This was a positive day. I didn't go backward at
all. I'll run hard [today] and come back and play Thursday." ... The
Dodgers made their first cuts, sending pitchers Victor Alvarez, Steve
Colyer, Carlos Garcia, Lindsay Gulin, Craig House, Danny Mota,
Ricardo Rodriguez and Rafael Roque, catcher Jose Diaz and outfielders
Luke Allen and Chin-Feng Chen to minor league camp.</TE>

<HD>Cullen Is Gearing Up for New Line of Work</HD>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since forward Matt Cullen returned to the lineup after being benched
for a short spell in January, he's been one off the team's best
players.</LD>
<LD>   Now Coach Bryan Murray is ready to throw another challenge at him.</LD>
<LD>   Cullen, who has played center at every level of his hockey career,
will open tonight's game against Pittsburgh at right wing. He will
skate on a line with center Andy McDonald and left wing Mike Leclerc.</LD>
<TE>   "I've played [on the wing] maybe for a game or two but nothing
more," said Cullen, second on the team in scoring with 16 goals and
40 points. "It's going to be a big change for me because I won't be
involved all of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing for me will be getting used to the timing on
breakouts. But other than that, it's great because I get a chance to
come into the offensive side on my weak side with an option to cut
in. It's easier for me to make a play on that side of the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Murray has been pleased with Cullen's game since he sat him down
and is hoping the 25-year-old former national high school player of
the year is ready to take the next step.</TE>
<TE>   With Steve Rucchin back in the lineup and playing well, Murray had
to find a way to maintain playing time for McDonald and Cullen.
That's one reason behind the move.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a stage for [Cullen] to go through," Murray said.
"Both Andy and Matt have been on a good string. Having them together
gives me a chance to play them more often and gives us a chance to
score more goals when they are on the ice."</TE>

<HD>Elliott's Goal Lifts Galaxy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: He scores in 32nd minute of 1-0 victory over Cruz
Azul of Mexican League.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Ruiz, the Galaxy's new striker from Guatemala, made his
Southern California debut Tuesday night, but the capacity crowd of
more than 10,000 that showed up at Cal State Fullerton's Titan
Stadium wasn't there to see him.</LD>
<LD>   Apart from a small pocket of Galaxy faithful, the crowd consisted
almost entirely of blue-clad fans of Mexican league power Cruz Azul,
but they went home disappointed after Los Angeles scored a 1-0
victory on a well-created and well-taken goal by Simon Elliott.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy, which finished second behind the San Jose Earthquakes
in the 2001 Major League Soccer season, is unbeaten in 11 tune-up
games as it prepares to open its seventh MLS campaign one week from
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Elliott's goal came in the 32nd minute of a game that frequently
threatened to escape the control of referee Richard Grady. Fouls were
frequent and by the final whistle Grady had issued yellow cards to
four players, including Galaxy defender Danny Califf and winger Chris
Albright.</TE>
<TE>   With 7:09 to play, Grady ejected Cruz Azul midfielder Victor
Gutierrez after his off-the-ball confrontation with Cobi Jones and
that red card ended Cruz Azul's chance of tying the score.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid paired Ruiz, who had scored five goals in
his first six games for Los Angeles, with Brian Mullan, and the two
forwards caused the Mexican team's defense numerous problems.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a neat bit of combination play by defender Adam Frye,
midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos and Elliott that brought the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Frye, playing at left back in place of injured newcomer Tyrone
Marshall, overlapped down the left wing and crossed the ball into the
penalty area, where it rebounded off a defender for Cienfuegos to
feed Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott's shot into the lower left corner of the net beat Adrian
Zermeno.</TE>
<TE>   Word from France on Tuesday was that Galaxy and U.S. national team
defender Greg Vanney will remain with Bastia in the French league.</TE>
<TE>   The French daily newspaper L'Equipe reported that Vanney had
agreed to a four-year contract with the club, which is based on the
Mediterranean island of Corsica.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy declined to confirm the story Tuesday night, saying
only that Vanney is on loan to Bastia and that, by Friday, the French
club must exercise its option to keep or return him.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, forward Eric Wynalda has failed to sign with MLS and
said he will not be playing for the Galaxy this season.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Quotable Wooden"</LD>
<LD>   Author: John Reger</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: TowleHouse Publishing, Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14.95</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden, the former UCLA basketball coach, is considered one
of the greatest in all of sports. He is also considered one of the
most quotable, and his quotes get a G-rating.</TE>
<TE>   This 6-inchx7-inch, 133-page hardcover book is a compilation of
Wooden's quotes.</TE>
<TE>   John Reger, a Southern California writer who has covered UCLA for
several publications, points out that although he is given author's
credit, the only words he wrote were for the preface. The rest are
all quotes, mostly from Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * "It's what you learn after you know it all that counts."</TE>
<TE>   * "Don't let making a living prevent you from making a life."</TE>
<TE>   * "The time to make friends is before you need them."</TE>
<TE>   * "If one of my players did a 360 dunk, he would be off the court
before his feet hit the floor."</TE>
<TE>   * "Discipline yourself and others won't have to."</TE>
<TE>   * "Sports do not build character. They reveal it."</TE>
<TE>   In the book's appendix, pages 107-133, is Wooden's game-by-game
coaching record at UCLA.</TE>

<LD>Despite plenty of ifs, ands and buts, the early-season losses
suffered by some of the top boys' tennis teams in Southern California
are notable.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine University (2-1), highly regarded by nearly everyone and
No. 1 in The Times' preseason rankings, lost, 10-8, to unranked Palos
Verdes Peninsula. The Trojans were without two of their top singles
players, Henry Mak and Jack Li.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, University Coach John Kessler gave a tip of his cap
to the Panthers and their top player, Virginia-bound senior Rylan
Rizza.</LD>
<TE>   "What an athlete," Kessler said of Rizza. "I was really impressed.
There's no doubt Peninsula wanted that match more than we did, and
they had enough talent to do it."</TE>
<TE>   University, the Southern Section Division II champion the past two
years, has plenty of talent too.</TE>
<TE>   The trick will be getting its top seven players--Aaron Yovan, Mak,
Li, Jeff Lawrence, Anson Hsu, Michael Haier and Matt Chou--all out on
the same day, what with conflicts with academic classes, junior
tournaments and personal training schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "When all seven are there, we're a great team," Kessler said. "But
that's when they're all there."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Servite (3-1), No. 2 in preseason rankings, fell to
unranked Placentia El Dorado. The Friars were without top singles
player Patrick Buchanan and top doubles player Tyrone Wang.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of matches involving Corona del Mar (5-0) demonstrate how
competitive the top teams are, particularly those in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Kings edged Los Alamitos (1-1), No. 4 in the preseason
rankings, by a 10-8 margin. They were also tested by No. 10 Fullerton
Troy before prevailing on games, 72-60. The Warriors (6-1) were
without their No. 2 doubles team of Eugene Lee and Neil Patel because
Lee was taking a college entrance exam.</TE>
<TE>   Top of the tournament: Malibu High senior Doug Stewart, the
defending Southern Section singles champion, defeated Peninsula's
Rizza, 6-3, 7-5, in Sunday's boys' 18 title match of the 21st South
Bay Junior tournament at Jack Kramer Tennis Club in Rolling Hills
Estates.</TE>
<TE>   University's Li was awarded third place when Yevgeny Supeko of
Ojai retired because of an injury trailing, 1-0, in the first set,
and Corona del Mar's Cameron Ball defeated Troy's Jeffrey Das, 6-2,
6-1, in the back-draw final.</TE>
<TE>   Best of the rest: The opening rounds of the inaugural
CIF/Wilson/SCTA First Serve Boys' Team Tennis Competition were
completed Saturday at Orange Coast College and Long Beach Recreation
Park.</TE>
<TE>   The two-weekend tournament has individual players going head
to-head in singles and doubles rather than using the round-robin
format typical of high school matches.</TE>
<TE>   Competition includes teams from 20 schools, with squads made up
strictly of players not among the top 150 in Southern California
Tennis Assn. age-group rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia and Bosco Tech are each 2-0 in the event and will play
one another in a final match in Long Beach on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   The team with the best record will be declared the site winner
under the round-robin format.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond Bar will play Garden Grove Bolsa Grande and Covina Charter
Oak will face Riverside King in semifinals on March 23 at Orange
Coast, where pool play was used. The final match is scheduled for 3
p.m. the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of geared to the kids who wouldn't otherwise be exposed
to the SCTA," said Darren Potkey, assistant manager of the SCTA
chapter of High Performance, the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s player
development program.</TE>
<TE>   All participants will receive an SCTA membership.</TE>

<HD>Pick Six Is Wager of Choice</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bettors who like to play the pick six are advised to bring a sizable
bankroll to the track today and arrive early.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is there a $205,959 carry-over in Santa Anita's pick six,
there is also a decent carry-over at Gulfstream Park and a more
modest one at Golden Gate Fields.</LD>
<LD>   When no one was able to isolate all six winners in the sequence
Monday at Gulfstream, more than $82,000 was carried into today. A
two-day carry-over at Golden Gate Fields means there is more than
$39,000 already up for grabs at the northern California track.</LD>
<TE>   Blessed with good weather and large fields, Santa Anita has had a
slew of carry-overs, and there certainly are no free spots in the
last six races on today's card, most of which are wide-open and short
on quality. The sequence begins with older, California-bred fillies
and mares running for a $10,000 claiming price and there are also two
maiden claimers.</TE>
<TE>   At Gulfstream Park, where the pick six is offered on races 4-9
today, those looking for a single might zero in on Siringas. An
Irish-bred filly trained by sharp trainer Christophe Clement and
ridden by Jerry Bailey, she will make her first start since a nose
loss on Oct. 26 at Belmont Park in the seventh, a turf race at 1 1/16
miles.</TE>
<TE>   An interesting shipper in the Golden Gate pick six is Artic
Explorer. A half-brother of Appeal The Call, the 3-year-old gelding
won at first asking at Santa Anita for trainer Cliff Sise, beating
next-out winner Benderosa. Artic Explorer will be ridden by Jason
Lumpkins and probably will be the favorite in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Invisible Ink, best known for finishing second in
the 2001 Kentucky Derby, will make his first start as a 4-year-old in
today's eighth at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  The jockeys' race at Santa Anita. Kent Desormeaux
tightened things considerably with a big week and trails Alex Solis,
55-52.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Mel Stute. The trainer is winless in 49 races at Santa
Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the seventh using Whoopddoo,
Comedy Class and Fort Donna.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/157. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $24.20/$926.80. Total money bet: $944.</TE>

<DH>After a Disappointing Junior Season, Kapono Still Has a Lot
on His Plate, Including a Decision About the NBA</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The place is sweltering and Jason Kapono is hard at work. Arms
flying, feet shuffling, he displays impeccable timing and just enough
quickness to keep from getting burned.</LD>
<LD>   There are no timeouts in this game, he reminds himself, wiping his
hands on an oil-splattered apron.</LD>
<LD>   A ticket's up for the party of eight at Table 6: two calamari
starters, four Caesar salads, four clam chowders, two steaks medium,
one rare with a char, another well done; two crab-stuffed Chilean sea
bass specials, a salmon filet on a bed of spinach and, oh, one order
of pot roast, don't overcook the carrots please.</LD>
<TE>   The thought of 40 minutes of basketball is like a cool breeze at
Club Med about now, Kapono says to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he comes back for more, five days a week for three summers,
slipping into his kitchen whites and tall chef's hat--he always did
have a thing for headgear--beginning another grueling shift as prep
cook at Phil Trani's Fine Food and Spirits in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Some athletes are pampered. Some take summer jobs rolling out the
balls at a rec center. Some even get paid for doing nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   There are no slackers in a full-tilt restaurant kitchen, though,
and Kapono has the stove blisters and knife nicks to prove it. He
might talk like a surfer and dress like a Dr. Seuss character in his
goofy hats and brightly colored pants, but UCLA's top scorer is
happiest working up a sweat amid chaos.</TE>
<TE>   He gets into a Zen-like state of mind, living in the moment and
loving it. It's the same way on the hardwood. Unable to jump the
highest or run the fastest, the 6-foot-8 junior forward is in
constant motion, setting screens, shaking a defender, touching the
leather and letting his trademark three-point shot fly.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a grounded guy, for all the stuff he's experienced, very
down-to-earth," said Jason Flowers, a former Bruin and Kapono's
closest friend. "He's very composed and mature for his age and
comfortable with who he is.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize how hard he works. I've told him, 'You work
more than any player I've been around.' The positive things he gets,
he deserves."</TE>
<TE>   And the negative? Kapono is stressed and unfulfilled these days,
perplexed at his team's uneven play, dissatisfied with his own
performance and acutely aware that the looming NCAA tournament is
UCLA's Last Chance Saloon.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you want to leave here tagged as a winner," he said.
"There are a lot of pro players who are great but they never won a
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Neither has Kapono, who tries not to think about whether to leave
UCLA for the NBA. Once the season is over, he'll do what he did after
his freshman and sophomore years and make two lists--call them the
pros and college.</TE>
<TE>   Then he'll follow his heart, which is currently under the 24-hour
watch of Ashley Cline, a UCLA sophomore from Danville, Calif. Kapono
met her two summers ago in the restaurant kitchen, where her brother
worked as well.</TE>
<TE>   On Valentine's Day, 2001, he made her dinner from scratch: halibut
stuffed with crab, chicken Parmesan with rice, broccoli and carrots.</TE>
<TE>   "She's my one true love," he said. "She's great for me. She likes
to hang around and watch games; she'll even go to watch a high school
game. Then vice versa, we hang out with her family, go shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Ashley has a vote on whether her boyfriend stays in school. So
does Kapono's occasionally outspoken father, Joe. Bruin Coach Steve
Lavin can weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   Will the cat in the hat come back? Ultimately, the choice is his
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "You only have a small chance of getting to the pros," Kapono
said. "There are only 330 roster spots that go to all the kids
playing basketball. So you have to choose what time is best for you.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I don't know, and I don't want to know. I'm not going
to worry about that, because if I do, it's going to creep into my
mind when I'm playing."</TE>
<TE>   And he understands that an unfettered mind allows him to get into
the spontaneous flow so important to a scorer. Lately, it has been
elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono has made three or fewer baskets in five of the last eight
games and his scoring average, 16.7 points, is the lowest it has been
all season. He's shooting a glittering 46.4% from three-point range
and 86.7% on free throws, but it has been increasingly difficult for
him to get open shots.</TE>
<TE>   Is he tiring? Does UCLA's new motion offense, with its absence of
screens and emphasis on athleticism, make it difficult for him to
shake a defender?</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't want to consider any of it. As they say at the
restaurant, if you can't stand the heat ...</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine; the team's fine," he said. "We've played our best ball
during times like this, when we are being counted out. It's just
about all of us playing well, up to the level we've shown at times,
and sustaining it."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's only winning streak--a nine-game surge in December and
early January--coincided with Kapono's playing point guard. Freshman
starter Cedric Bozeman was sidelined by a knee injury after the
Bruins' 2-2 start and Kapono seized the opportunity to display the
ballhandling skills he'd developed during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few shaky moments--seven turnovers against
Georgetown, one-for-eight three-point shooting against
Washington--but Kapono proved he is more than a one-dimensional
player and laid to rest any suspicions that he is a selfish gunner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a guy who is worried about his stats," he said. "I'm a
team player, I want scouts to know that."</TE>
<TE>   But he's also cognizant of his climb through the UCLA record book.
And that's one for the "college" side of the ledger, scribbled below
Ashley, a degree and a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono has scored at a remarkably consistent rate. He averaged 16
points and made 82 three-pointers as a freshman, averaged 17.2 points
and made 84 three-pointers as a sophomore. He is 84 for 181 from long
range this season and with 250 he has made 53 more three-pointers
than any other Bruin.</TE>
<TE>   He ranks 15th on the school's scoring list, and in one more season
would be almost certain to move up to No. 3, passing such former
players as Marques Johnson, Gail Goodrich, David Greenwood, Bill
Walton, Ed O'Bannon and Reggie Miller, and could challenge Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar at No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean that much now because I am still playing," Kapono
said. "You think of all the great players who have gone through this
program and you don't even think of yourself as part of that group.</TE>
<TE>   "But later on in life, sitting with the wife and kids and saying,
'I was one of the top five scorers,' that means a lot because this is
the greatest program ever. Our record book is a who's who of
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono sends signals about returning. Lavin recently spoke to the
team about next season's lineup during a bus ride to the airport and
left out Kapono, who quickly raised his hand and said, "What about
me, Coach?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's teasing me," Kapono said. "That's his way to get a read on
me, count me out and see how I react."</TE>
<TE>   In a rare moment, he'll catch himself dreaming of playing for the
Lakers, who could use a spot-up three-point shooter. Just the other
night, he and Ashley calculated there is a 7% chance of an NBA team
from California drafting him.</TE>
<TE>   The glamour and accompanying temptations of NBA life don't seem
important to him. Ashley says he has never taken a drink, and he
likes nothing more than spending a quiet evening with her or his
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "His relationship with his family is unique," Ashley said. "He
goes home every week and talks to his parents every day. He's always
wanted to settle down."</TE>
<TE>   And spend time in a kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a really good cook," Ashley said. "We've talked about, after
he retires from playing, whether it's overseas or here, he'd open a
restaurant, somewhere his family can hang out and visit."</TE>
<TE>   That's when the mantle of "UCLA's third-leading all-time scorer"
might bring value. But Kapono has learned what's most important.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like basketball is about winning," he said, "a restaurant is
about the food."</TE>

<HD>Rookie Bednar Gets Murray's Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jaroslav Bednar, the leading goal scorer in the Finnish Elite League
last season but a bust in 10 games with the Kings last fall, returned
to the lineup Monday night after spending most of the season in the
minors.</LD>
<LD>   The rookie right wing from the Czech Republic played well enough
in the Kings' 2-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks that he'll be
back in the lineup Thursday night against the St. Louis Blues, Coach
Andy Murray said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought he played with some bite in his game," Murray said of
Bednar, who had no shots on goal but a team-high five hits in 14
minutes 45 seconds. "He had three hits in his first shift on the ice,
made some good decisions with the puck."</LD>
<TE>   Bednar, 25, scored no goals and had only one assist last fall
before he was demoted to the Kings' American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H. He had 16 goals and 21 assists in 48 games with the
Monarchs before being recalled Monday when Kelly Buchberger was put
on the injured list because of a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized right from training camp, 'This guy's got the
ability,'" Murray said. "But there's a difference between having the
ability and knowing how to play the game. I don't think he knew how
to play the game here, the North American game--positional-wise, and
what's demanded physically."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though his won-loss percentage, goals-against average and save
percentage are better than those of No. 1 goaltender Felix Potvin,
Jamie Storr may have made his last start this season, Murray has
hinted several times recently.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough time for Jamie," the coach said of his backup
goaltender, who is 8-4-3 with a 2.05 goals-against average and .917
save percentage. "He's got every reason to come to me and say, 'Andy,
look at my numbers. Look at my save percentage. Look at my won-loss
record. How come I'm not playing?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I would simply tell him, 'Jamie, I think you're a great
goalie, but we're playing our No. 1 guy. That's why we have a No. 1
guy--to play in these games.'"</TE>

<HD>Off-Season Toe Surgery Is Likely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After limping through most of the season, Shaquille O'Neal said
Tuesday he probably would have off-season surgery to ease the pain in
his arthritic big toe, a procedure he was told would require a
three-month recovery period.</LD>
<LD>   "I want the pain to go away forever," he said.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal is expected to be examined by Dr. Robert Mohr, who more
than a month ago took over the treatment of O'Neal's ailment, no
later than Saturday. Mohr, chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical
Center, has called surgery a last resort and only recently prescribed
changes in O'Neal's shoes and orthotics.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal said he would wait at least 30 days after the season, a
period he said he would spend resting and considering other opinions.
The possibility of surgery, he said, is "over 80%."</TE>
<TE>   If the procedure were necessary, the club probably would encourage
him to have it immediately after the season, to allow him more
recovery time before next season.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, General Manager Mitch Kupchak said it was "premature"
to assume surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, he can continue to play at the level he's playing at
right now and address it in the off-season," Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the second procedure in two off-seasons for O'Neal,
who had surgery to correct a deformity in his small left toe on Aug.
29, and as a result experienced pain in the area for much of the
early season.</TE>
<TE>   He has been on the injured list twice since Christmas because of
the arthritis, which he estimates costs him six to eight points a
game and saps his mobility.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still a step slow," he said. "I have baby kangaroo springs
rather than adult kangaroo springs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are less adamant about resting O'Neal's toe before the
playoffs. Coach Phil Jackson also said that when the time for the
decision comes, he is as likely to gauge the teams behind the Lakers
in the West as those ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost one more game than Pacific Division and
conference-leading Sacramento and have two games left against the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Though Vlade Divac, who rivals Patrick Ewing in the field of cheap
predictions, said the Lakers would require home-court advantage to
get past the Kings, Jackson implied that Games 1 and 2 in Sacramento
do not frighten him. The Lakers won twice in Sacramento in last
season's playoffs, but those were Games 3 and 4, by which time the
Kings--and Chris Webber in particular--appeared to have lost their
zeal for the series.</TE>
<TE>   "One to five is not a very big slide in this conference," he said.
"You want home-court for a couple rounds [at least]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Jackson would love to see O'Neal shed some girth and
regain mobility in the next 21 games, and keeping him on the court
might be the best way--or the only way--to do that. O'Neal's
arthritic big toe limits his practice time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his conditioning is better. I think his tone is better,"
Jackson said. "Obviously, we've got to get him to lose some weight.
That goes without saying, simply because of the stress on his toe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson, vice president and part-owner of the Lakers, told
the New York Post that he would consider selling his interest in the
club in order to take a management position with the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   "What I don't see in the Knicks' organization is a basketball
guy," Johnson told the Post.</TE>

<HD>Other Lakers Create a Buzz</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal scores only nine points, but
everyone contributes to 107-66 rout of Hornets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal had just been saying that the Lakers were the Lakers
and not him, and not Kobe Bryant, but the rest of them, and all of
them.</LD>
<LD>   He's beginning to assume his toe will never be quite right, that
he's going to have to drag it through April and May and, he hopes,
June, and then have the surgery and be done with it.</LD>
<LD>   He can't be sure, because he'd have to get up on his tiptoes to
see that far ahead, and he hasn't been able to do that for months.
Anyway, as if to prove his point, O'Neal went out, had a uniquely
human game against the usually game Charlotte Hornets, and watched
his teammates carry the rout.</LD>
<TE>   They were 107-66 winners Tuesday night at Staples Center, where a
combination of Laker activity and Hornet ineptitude set a Laker
record for fewest points allowed. Twenty points back after the third
quarter, the Hornets distinguished themselves with a lifeless 12
points in the final 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson called his defense "good, though maybe
not as good as it appears on the stat sheet."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 23 points and six players scored as many or
more than O'Neal's nine points, including Rick Fox and Lindsey
Hunter, who had 12 each. O'Neal had been their leading scorer for
nine consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "He was struggling a little bit before the game," Jackson said,
"said he wasn't feeling good."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was three for nine from the field in 26 minutes, but had 10
rebounds. Bryant was poked in the eye in the third quarter, was
examined after the game and no damage was found. He, like O'Neal,
left without addressing reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of drama in the game brought unusual attention to Fox's
hairdo, which lacked the hair part.</TE>
<TE>   After months of tying it, bundling it, curling it, balling it and
dressing it up to make it manageable and presentable, Fox finally cut
it all off and saved himself the aggravation.</TE>
<TE>   "Celebrity couples in Hollywood have broken up for less," Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, shiny suited him for a night.</TE>
<TE>   Barely 24 hours before, a full-maned Fox sat beneath a basket at
the Laker practice facility and wondered where his game had been. He
believed his puffy and stiff knees explained some of it, but not all.
His shooting percentage (40.2) and three-point percentage (31.4) are
well below his career numbers (45.7 and 35.3, respectively) and his
expectations, and the second part is what mattered most.</TE>
<TE>   So, off came the hair before Tuesday's shoot-around, and on came
his game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more aerodynamic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He played 11 minutes in the first quarter, made four of five
field-goal attempts for eight points, had two assists and stuck to
Jamal Mashburn with a familiar determination. He made six of eight
attempts overall for his 12 points, and had a coolness about him.</TE>
<TE>   "It more or less signifies the time of year," said Fox, who
suffered a gash on his head, courtesy of Charlotte's Jamal Magloire.
"I look at myself in the mirror, it's definitely not a friendly
look."</TE>
<TE>   It all helped to drive the Lakers in the early minutes, when the
Hornets pushed the rout by missing a lot of open shots. These things
happen on the road in the NBA, but not often to the Hornets. They
were 18-14 away from the Hive, where they are dreadful and, often,
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's fourth field goal of the first quarter, with 1:02 remaining,
gave the Lakers a 24-14 lead. He drew his second personal foul 15
seconds later and watched Devean George play the entire second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles, where he played in his high school and
college, Baron Davis was not exempt from the shooting woes of the
Hornets. He missed four of five field-goal attempts in the first
half, and they missed 25 of 39. He missed all three of his
three-point attempts, and they missed all five.</TE>
<TE>   Davis finished with four points on one-of-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets took the Lakers to the final shot--Bryant's--nearly
three weeks ago in Charlotte, and the Lakers figured to have their
problems with the Hornet guards and sizable front line. This is no
dinky Eastern team, starting 7-footer Elden Campbell and 6-11 P.J.
Brown, and subbing 6-11 Magloire, a matchup issue in the last game.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately that amounted to little more than over-analysis. The
Lakers were too polished and too tight.</TE>

<HD>It's a Big Swiss Miss for Agassi</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Tournament's defending champion is dumped in the
first round by Kratochvil of Switzerland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>The roller-coaster world of men's professional tennis took a violent
dip Tuesday, with the hottest player in the game, Andre Agassi,
riding in the front car. The only injury was to Agassi, defending
champion in this event, now called the Pacific Life Open, who was
ousted in the first round by a 22-year-old Swiss player with
credentials known to dozens.</LD>
<LD>   When Michel Kratochvil, nicknamed Mischa, slapped a gutty backhand
winner down the line to finish off his second straight tiebreaker set
against Agassi, the celebration was probably deafening in
Ostermundigen, Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   Kratochvil's 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) win, the biggest for this
hard-hitting baseliner in his fourth full year on the main ATP tour,
brought an abrupt halt to the run of Las Vegas' finest.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi had bounced back from an early-season wrist injury to make
the final at San Jose two weeks ago, losing a highly competitive
match to No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt after having 21 break points and two
match points, and then win Sunday's final at Scottsdale, Ariz., the
50th tour title of his career.</TE>
<TE>   So a first-round draw against a European player with a
hard-to-pronounce name seemed to be another fastball down the middle
for the veteran Agassi, who has done a superb job of maintaining
fitness and motivation through an 18-year career that has included
seven Grand Slam titles. Almost nobody on the men's tour has been as
proficient as Agassi at grinding through these early matches against
lesser-ranked players. In this regard, he is a male Martina Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, the grinding wasn't enough against a player who gave
back everything sent his way, and more. Nor was the grinding as easy
as it once was, when the body was in its mid-20s, rather than its
current 31 years, 11 months.</TE>
<TE>   When he took the Stadium Court against Kratochvil, Agassi was
playing his 11th match in 15 days. When he lost, he became the first
defending champion to drop his first match the next year since Jim
Courier lost to Patrick Rafter in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Agassi echoed the refrain of most of the
once-invincibles of the pro tour.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are too good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also implied that upsets such as he suffered Tuesday were not
so surprising after all.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a whole lot separates us," Agassi said. "If they are playing
their game, and you're not playing yours, you can't expect to win."</TE>
<TE>   So the gradual changing of the guard continues in a sport that has
gotten used to its superstars and identifiable heroes:</TE>
<TE>   * Pete Sampras struggles to beat a kid in a red shirt Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   * Goran Ivanisevic can't go anymore because of a serving shoulder
held together by twine and has to withdraw Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   * Agassi goes out in straight sets a few hours later.</TE>
<TE>   * In the night match, Michael Chang loses, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3, against
Paradorn Srichapahn of Thailand, a qualifier who was favored to win.
Chang, a three-time winner here, hasn't won a match on the tour since
October of last year--when he beat Ivanisevic--and got into this
event only because tournament officials have a memory and a heart and
gave him a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   * Then, in the interviews after his big upset, Kratochvil talks
about the things that have inspired him when he was a child, trying
to decide whether to stick with tennis or hockey. He talks about
remembering the 1989 French Open, when Chang played his sensational
match against Ivan Lendl and went on to win his only Grand Slam
title. When the French was played in 1989, Kratochvil was  10.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Kratochvil is part of the new generation, players less
intimidated by the Samprases and Agassis and more confident of their
own ability to take over.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a pretty tight match," Kratochvil said. "I knew I was
playing my game, going for my shots, that I had a good chance....
Today I just took them."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi was seeded fourth here, and he wasn't the only seeded
player to lose, just the most prominent. No. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero of
Spain, most comfortable on clay and against another baseliner, got a
double dose of medium-fast hard courts at the Indian Wells Tennis
Garden and big serving Greg Rusedski of England. Rusedski won, 6-4,
6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Also falling was sixth-seeded Sebastien Grosjean of France, a 6-3,
4-6, 7-5 victim of countryman Fabrice Santoro, and 17th-seeded
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador to qualifier Karol Kucera of Slovakia,
6-2, 6-3. Unseeded Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, finalist
here when Chang won in '97, went out to Albert Costa of Spain, 6-1,
3-6, 6-3. Seeded players Tommy Haas of Germany (5), Roger Federer of
Switzerland (12) and Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic (13) advanced.</TE>
<TE>   There were just two matches played in the women's segment of the
Pacific Life Open, and Emmanuelle Gagliardi of Switzerland, unseeded,
and Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, seeded 18th, advanced to the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Gagliardi cruised past Anna Smashnova of Israel, 6-2, 6-1, and
became the lowest-ranked player, at No. 70, to reach the semifinals
of this tournament since Stephanie Rottier at No. 76 did it in 1993.
Hantuchova, who got everybody's attention by taking Venus Williams to
7-5 in the third set in the Australian Open, beat American Lisa
Raymond, seeded 12th, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Thomas isn't sure about his new nickname, but he's glad to get
the attention.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas scored 16 points, including six in the final 3:42, helping
the Houston Rockets to a 101-98 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics
on Tuesday at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Two of Thomas' final three baskets came by driving the lane, a
muscle play for which he is starting to become known. Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich calls Thomas his "Raging Bull."</LD>
<TE>   "It's always something," Thomas said when asked about the
nickname. "I'll take it, I guess, if he's going to give me more time
late in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Rocket guard Cuttino Mobley, who scored 38 points, definitely is a
Thomas fan.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny's a clutch player," Mobley said. "He doesn't get recognized
a lot, but we love and respect him. He does everything for us."</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics certainly recognized him when Thomas scored four
points and got two rebounds in a 13-0 run that turned the game around
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 98, Memphis 84--The Spurs won their 18th consecutive
game over the Grizzlies as Tim Duncan scored 23 points at San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio, which won its seventh in a row, had five players in
double figures. Duncan had 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 90, Phoenix 78--Reserve Jim Jackson scored 23 points at
Miami to lead a balanced offense and the Heat continued its pursuit
of a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, playing extra minutes because of an ankle injury to
Kendall Gill, helped spark the Heat to its eighth victory in the last
10 games. Miami, which was one game out of the final playoff spot in
the East before the game, is 21-7 since Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 104, New York 96--Inspired by the ejection of Dikembe
Mutombo, the 76ers rallied from a 20-point deficit in the third
quarter at New York and won their fourth consecutive.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 35 points and Eric Snow had 23, and
Philadelphia overcame the loss of its best defender and rebounder
after he was called for two flagrant fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 115, Golden State 101--Austin Croshere scored 19 points
and Jonathan Bender had 17 at Indianapolis, where the Pacers had
seven players in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers held the Warriors scoreless for more than five minutes
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 110, Chicago 81--Michael Redd scored 21 points and the
Bucks did not give up a field goal over a span of 9:40 in the second
half at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 86, Toronto 84--Kenyon Martin scored on a rebound with
less than a second to play at East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nets
ended a season-high four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The United States added center Raef LaFrentz of the Dallas
Mavericks, along with guard Andre Miller of the Cleveland Cavaliers
and forward Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics, to the squad that will
compete in the World Championships at Indianapolis this summer....
Toronto Raptor assistant Stan Albeck was discharged from a
rehabilitation program, less than three months after he had a stroke
in the locker room before a game.... Dee Brown came out of
retirement, leaving the Orlando Magic's front office and signing a
10-day contract with the team. The Magic hope the 33-year-old guard
can plug a hole on the perimeter created by Mike Miller's injury.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Raiders promoted offensive coordinator Bill Callahan to
head coach Tuesday night, three weeks after Jon Gruden left to coach
Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders will introduce Callahan during a news conference today
at their Alameda facility.</LD>
<LD>   Callahan spent four seasons as Gruden's offensive coordinator with
the Raiders and also worked with Gruden as Philadelphia's offensive
line coach from 1995-97.</LD>
<TE>   Gruden, who left with a year remaining on his contract with the
Raiders, received a five-year deal worth about $17.5 million from
Tampa Bay. As compensation, the Raiders received two first-round
draft picks, two second-rounders and $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle La'Roi Glover, who led the NFL in sacks in the
2000 season, has signed a $22-million, five-year contract with the
Dallas Cowboys. The deal includes a $6-million signing bonus</TE>
<TE>   Dale Carter, the four-time all-pro cornerback suspended one year
for violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy, signed a seven-year
contract with the New Orleans Saints. The Saints also signed
Minnesota wide receiver Jake Reed, who is Carter's brother, to a
one-year contract, and kicker John Carney.... The New England
Patriots signed wide receiver Donald Hayes from the Carolina
Panthers.... The Washington Redskins cut five-time Pro Bowl kick
returner Michael Bates to save money under the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Daron Rahlves, the world champion in the super-giant slalom,
dislocated his hip, a few days before he was scheduled to race in the
U.S. ski championships. Tina Chumas, a spokeswoman for the U.S. ski
team, said Rahlves was injured while free skiing.</TE>
<TE>   Waving a large American flag as he entered the finish area, Martin
Buser captured his fourth Iditarod and completed the 1,100-mile race
in record time. He and his dogs ended their trek from Anchorage to
Nome, Alaska, in eight days, 22 hours 46 minutes--the first musher to
do so in less than nine days.</TE>
<TE>   Cigar, a two-time winner of horse-of-the-year honors, heads the
list of eligibles for this year's Racing Hall of Fame ballot.
Inductees will be announced April 30, with induction ceremonies

<HD>Coyotes Still Win With Their Backup Plan, 3-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Esche made the most of a rare start for the Phoenix Coyotes.</LD>
<LD>   Esche, making an unscheduled start in place of Sean Burke, made 38
saves in his first start since Feb. 6 as the Coyotes defeated the
Chicago Blackhawks, 3-1, Tuesday night at Phoenix for their fifth
consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't lose your focus, but you practice all the time but
aren't battle-tested," Esche said. "You start to wonder if you're
part of it anymore."</LD>
<TE>   Esche had expected to spend his 11th consecutive game watching
from the bench, but got the nod a couple of hours before game time
when Burke arrived at the arena with flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Esche was pulled in the first period of his last start, also
against Chicago and also at home. But Tuesday, after an unsteady
start making 13 saves as his teammates opened a 2-0 lead, he settled
down to hold the Blackhawks to the lone goal as Chicago outshot the
Coyotes, 26-15.</TE>
<TE>   "We dodged a bullet," Phoenix Coach Bob Francis said. "Robert
stole one for us. It was coyote ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Briere and Brad May scored first-period goals, both on
breakaways, and Michal Handzus added an empty-net goal for the
Coyotes, who are unbeaten in regulation in their last nine games
(7-0-1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix pulled even with the idle Kings and St. Louis for fifth
place in the Western Conference with 75 points, and moved within five
points of the Pacific Division-leading San Jose Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 5, Washington 2--Sergei Zubov had a goal and two assists at
Washington as the Stars snapped a two-game losing streak with a
victory over the Capitals.</TE>
<TE>   Both Dallas and Washington are fighting for the final playoff spot
in the Western and Eastern Conference, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars entered the game with a two-point lead over Edmonton for
the eighth spot while Washington was three points behind New Jersey
and New York for the Eastern Conference's last slot.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Buffalo 0--Chris Osgood made 28 saves for
his fourth shutout in Michael Peca's return to Buffalo, as the
Islanders defeated the Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   Kip Miller, Dave Scatchard and Jason Blake scored for New York.</TE>
<TE>   Peca, the former Sabre captain traded to the Islanders last summer
after a season-long holdout, was held without a point and was booed
every time he touched the puck.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Atlanta 4--Dan Boyle scored with 11:55 left in
regulation at Atlanta and the Lightning rallied from a three-goal
deficit to tie the Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Cibak, Dave Andreychuk and Ben Clymer also had goals for
Tampa Bay, which scored twice in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Lubos Bartecko scored two goals for Atlanta, which ended a
three-game losing streak. Brian Pothier and Pascal Rheaume also
scored for the Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, Toronto 1--Gary Roberts scored with 2:05 remaining
in the third period at Toronto and Corey Schwab made 22 saves as the
Maple Leafs tied the Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   John LeClair scored for Philadelphia, which held a team meeting on
Monday after losing to Toronto on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 5, Nashville 0--Todd Bertuzzi had two goals and two
assists and Brendan Morrison had a goal and two assists as the
Canucks won at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver held the Predators to one first-period shot, matching
Nashville's record low set in 1999, also against the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver's Dan Cloutier stopped 23 shots for his sixth shutout of
the season and seventh of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Minnesota 3--Magnus Arvedson's goal 1:41 into overtime
lifted the Senators over the Wild at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Pascal Dupuis' rebound goal 2:26 into the third period tied the
game for the Wild, which saw its three-game winning streak end.</TE>
<TE>   Todd White had a goal and an assist for the Senators, who also got
goals from Chris Neil and Radek Bonk.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Rangers traded forwards Manny Malhotra and Barrett
Heisten to the Dallas Stars for forwards Martin Rucinsky and Roman
Lyashenko. Malhotra, 21, has seven goals and six assists in 56 games
with New York this season. Lyashenko was recalled from Utah of the
AHL earlier in the day after Dallas waived right wing Rob DiMaio.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Block Well</HD>
<DH>Suitt Stayed at Pepperdine and Became School-Record Holder
as Well as WCC Defensive Player of the Year</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cedric Suitt came to Pepperdine five years ago, a self-described
"mama's boy" who soon became homesick for his native Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   He will leave the Malibu campus a husband, father, scholar and one
of the best defensive players in the history of the school's men's
basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   That's a lot of growing up in five years, but the personable Suitt
has managed his remarkable makeover through patience, persistence and
perseverance.</LD>
<TE>   He laughs now about his nightly phone conversations with his
mother, Sylvia, during his freshman year:</TE>
<TE>   Cedric: "Man, I'm coming home."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia: "Are you sure you want to come home?"</TE>
<TE>   Cedric: "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia: "Well, OK, we'll talk about it tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   His mother's sign-off prompted Suitt to put off packing his bags.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd say that every day until my freshman year was over," he
says with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine is glad he stuck around. Suitt, a 6-foot-11 senior, is
a big reason the Waves (22-8) are in the NCAA tournament and playing
Wake Forest (20-12) in the first round of the Midwest Regional on
Thursday at Arco Arena in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   As the Waves' last line of defense, Suitt has been a tsunami of
swat this season, setting school records for blocked shots in a
career (178), season (92) and game (10). And those numbers don't take
into account the countless shots Suitt--it's pronounced Sue-it--has
altered.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make an argument that he's been the most valuable player
on our team," Coach Paul Westphal said. "We're able to press and
gamble a lot on defense and create the tempo we want, and actually be
a high-scoring team, because we know that [teams are] not going to
get very many layups when Cedric is in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just been a very valuable player as a leader and as a
defensive specialist. We never would have had the success we've had
without him."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Waves might not be in the NCAA tournament had it not
been for the last of Suitt's 10 blocked shots against San Diego on
Jan. 26. With the score tied in the closing seconds of regulation,
San Diego guard Andre Laws drove to the basket for what would have
been a game-winning layup.</TE>
<TE>   Except Suitt went up and cleanly swatted the ball out of bounds as
the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "My eyes just focused on [Laws]," Suitt recalled. "When he kept
coming, I said, 'Just don't call a foul,' because I knew I was going
to jump with him, regardless."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine went on to win in double overtime, 96-91. Had the Waves
lost, they wouldn't have tied Gonzaga for the West Coast Conference
regular-season title and their RPI certainly would have dropped
dangerously close to the cutoff point for gaining entry into the
65-team NCAA field.</TE>
<TE>   After someone handed Suitt the score sheet from the game, showing
he had set the school record and tied the conference mark for blocks
in a game, he took it home and put it in his scrapbook.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a moment to remember," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Suitt has experienced many memorable moments in the last 12
months. He graduated last spring with a bachelor's degree in public
relations, got married in May, became a father in August and started
graduate school last fall, all before the first jump ball of his most
successful basketball season.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he was named WCC defensive player of the year and
was among six players selected to the WCC all-academic team, the only
Wave so honored. He has a 3.3 grade-point average in communications,
working toward a master's degree.</TE>
<TE>   "The past fiscal year has been very wonderful for me," said Suitt,
who lives in a Calabasas apartment with his wife, Danielle, and
daughter, Nia.</TE>
<TE>   Suitt and Danielle, a Pepperdine junior and former cheerleader,
met at school and began dating despite a nearly 2-foot difference in
height. Suitt claims Danielle told him she was 5-3 when they met, but
a visit to the doctor's office revealed his bride to be 5-1, just as
he had suspected all along.</TE>
<TE>   That means Suitt has a long way to bend down for a kiss, but, he
said, "It's worth it. That's my best friend and the love of my
life.... It's wonderful to find someone who accepts me. I'm a big kid
at heart."</TE>
<TE>   Suitt said his family will most likely settle in Atlanta--Danielle
is from Nashville--and he'll try to play professional basketball
overseas if he isn't drafted by an NBA team.</TE>
<TE>   Being surrounded by women is nothing new for Suitt. He was raised
by Sylvia, a single mother, and his grandmother, Sarah Bernice Suitt,
who died when he was a senior at Atlanta's Mays High. Suitt said he
has never met his father, who left when Cedric was 2 months old.</TE>
<TE>   "The women in my life have always been significant," he said. "I
have a lot of love and compassion for all of them."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches have been his father figures.</TE>
<TE>   Suitt said he has benefited greatly on the basketball court from
the influence of Westphal, who took over the Pepperdine program this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Though Suitt was a contributor for the Waves under previous
coaches Lorenzo Romar and Jan van Breda Kolff, he didn't become a
regular starter until this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe I have always had the ability to block shots, but Coach
Westphal has given me the opportunity," Suitt said. "He's had
confidence in me. Even though the season started out a little bumpy,
and there were one or two games where I didn't have any blocks, he
kept on me and believed in me.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning of the season, I was getting in a lot of foul
trouble. He told me just don't try to block everything. Once I took
on that state of mind, I started playing a lot more minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Suitt said he began to hit his stride in the Waves' game against
West Virginia on Jan. 30 in the Fiesta Bowl Classic at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   After making life miserable in the first half for forward Chris
Moss, Suitt said West Virginia's leading scorer approached him during
warmups for the second half with a request:</TE>
<TE>   "Stop blocking all my shots," Moss said.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been no stopping Suitt, who took over Pepperdine's
68-47 victory over St. Mary's in a WCC tournament semifinal March 3
by recording eight of the Waves' school-record 14 blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   "He's come up real big in some crucial games at crucial times,"
said Wave forward Boomer Brazzle. "It's a luxury to have a big shot
blocker like that who can protect the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success, Suitt still struggles at times. He has a
tendency to pick up early fouls, and his offensive game has been
nearly nonexistent. He averages only 3.1 points, compared to his 3.3
blocked shots, and his career high is eight points.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a big offensive game deep down in me somewhere," he said.
"After I got out of high school, I kind of buried it."</TE>
<TE>   If Suitt can unearth it for Pepperdine's game Thursday, you know
he'll find a place for the score sheet in his rapidly expanding
scrapbook.</TE>

<HD>Being a Dad Is Murray's Passion</HD>

<LD>The Kings are off, but their coach is on.</LD>
<LD>   Standing behind the boards at the HealthSouth Training Center, he
holds a stopwatch and barks at the three hockey players sprinting in
front of him.</LD>
<LD>   "Big strides! Big strides!"</LD>
<TE>   "Go! Go! Go!"</TE>
<TE>   One player has shoulder-length hair streaming out the back of the
helmet and you wonder, how can this person play for Andy Murray?</TE>
<TE>   Then you realize, it is his 13-year-old daughter, Sarah.</TE>
<TE>   The other two players are his sons, Brady, 17, and Jordy, 12.</TE>
<TE>   The children are in town for two weeks on spring break.</TE>
<TE>   Being their dad, as he is doing Tuesday in an otherwise empty
rink, is Murray's greatest strength.</TE>
<TE>   It is also what nearly killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Being a dad is the reason that, for the three years Murray has
been the Kings' coach, his family has stayed in familiar surroundings
in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Being a dad is why he is a tumultuous traveler, rushing to the
airport at the drop of a puck, routinely taking a three-hour flight
to watch two hours of a youth hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   Being a dad is why, last month, after arriving home on a red-eye
flight less than 24 hours earlier, he left his driveway in icy
weather at 4 a.m. and his truck later wound up skidding and tumbling
into a ditch.</TE>
<TE>   "When he told me he was going to try to make my game at 8 in the
morning, it made me think," says Brady, who was playing for his prep
school team in a tournament four hours away. "He had just gotten
home, and the weather was bad...."</TE>
<TE>   He shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   "My Dad sacrifices everything for us."</TE>
<TE>   Every devoted father carries scars. Andy Murray's are now real.</TE>
<TE>   On one of his first days back in town since the Feb. 15 accident,
you can't see the effects of the four broken ribs, the separated left
shoulder and the fractured left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   But you can see the faint red scar on his forehead from the 28
stitches.</TE>
<TE>   You can see the bright red scar on his right wrist from where he
punched out the truck's window.</TE>
<TE>   You can see the lost weight and even paler-than-normal complexion.</TE>
<TE>   He is considered one of the most driven coaches in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, because of the severity of his concussion, he is not allowed
to drive a car.</TE>
<TE>   He is considered one of the best strategists in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, because a hard fall could be fatal, he is not allowed to even
step on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   He says he still has occasional instances of fogginess. It is
clear he is still in almost constant pain.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, he raised his left arm to open a trunk and nearly
passed out.</TE>
<TE>   "This does give you a sense of mortality," he says. "But it
doesn't make me want to change anything. There were lots of parents
driving to the game in that early morning, and they all made it
fine."</TE>
<TE>   But there was surely only one parent whose accident could have
evoked this reaction from his son's teammates:</TE>
<TE>   "When they heard about the crash, they all said, 'Man, we're
surprised your dad didn't crawl up to the highway and hitchhike to
the game,'" Brady recalls, shaking his head. "My dad, he's a
die-hard."</TE>
<TE>   Almost literally.</TE>
<TE>   You want a really compelling story?</TE>
<TE>   Here's what would have happened to Andy Murray if his truck had
not crashed.</TE>
<TE>   He would have driven from Faribeault, Minn., to Madison, Wis., for
Brady's Friday morning game.</TE>
<TE>   Then he would have driven to Chicago for Jordy's tournament
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Then he would have returned to Faribeault to watch Sarah play
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, less than three days after coaching the Kings into
the middle of the playoff race before the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, he returned home from the crash in time to watch
Sarah's game.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the last game he would watch for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he began suffering from post-concussion syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   He was dizzy, vomiting, couldn't focus, couldn't think.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd had one thought for 10 seconds, then my mind would shift to
another thought," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He desperately wanted to close this eyes. But when he did, the
nausea would overwhelm him, so he couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get much sleep," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He tried watching the tape of a King loss to Columbus. He couldn't
focus long to finish it.</TE>
<TE>   He was stuck into an MRI machine for the first time. He felt
helpless for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me a new appreciation for the problems of players with
head injuries," he says. "You could never imagine."</TE>
<TE>   When his head finally cleared, he joined the Kings in Nashville
with a new emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about just watching the first game from the press box;
I was scared I would screw it up," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he stayed downstairs with the team. And of course,
Nashville being Nashville and Murray being Murray, the Kings won.</TE>
<TE>   If it hadn't been for a last-minute ricochet in Denver, they would
have been unbeaten in three games since his return.</TE>
<TE>   "This just shows I have good assistants," he says of Dave Tippett,
Mark Hardy and Ray Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   He just hopes he won't have to rely on any of them to do his job.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that his head problems are history.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctors say I'll be fine, that what I'm going through is
normal for this sort of injury," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While the rest of his life remains distinctly abnormal for a dad.</TE>
<TE>   He phones home three times a day. He flies home whenever possible,
even if just for the night.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, that night was spent on the floor of a Las
Vegas airport after his late connection was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   A King fan walked past and saw this lump on the ground and was
stunned to realize that it was the head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Andy "Red Eye" Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an ideal situation," he acknowledges. "Families
should not operate like this. But we've moved around enough. My kids
are comfortable. I don't want to change that."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Ruth, however is starting to have second thoughts. "It
sure does change the way I think now," she says. "Things can change
in a few seconds. We should really be together."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the summers, Murray says he spends more time with his
children than most fathers, and he's right.</TE>
<TE>   And Brady acknowledges that, having attended "at least six
schools" before his current junior year in high school, it is nice to
stay in one place.</TE>
<TE>   But for a few frightening moments last month, the only place that
mattered was a patch on a frozen Wisconsin highway, miles to go
before Andy Murray would sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "My father puts it all on the line for us," Brady says.</TE>
<TE>   Making some wonder if it was only a matter of time before he went
skidding across it.</TE>

<HD>Siena Finds Another Path</HD>
<DH>NCAA tournament: Saints, with losing record, defeat Alcorn
State in play-in game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DAYTON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The team that couldn't win during the regular season has figured it
out at tournament time.</LD>
<LD>   Siena became only the second team to win an NCAA tournament game
with a losing record, defeating Alcorn State, 81-77, Tuesday night in
a play-in game that provided a fitting start.</LD>
<LD>   Prosper Karangwa scored a career-high 31 points and Dwayne
Archbold made two free throws in the closing seconds--the type of
clutch performance that the Saints (17-18) rarely managed in the
regular season.</LD>
<TE>   "A week ago, we were left for dead," Coach Rob Lanier said. "It's
quite a contrast."</TE>
<TE>   Siena joined the 64-team bracket and won a trip to Washington to
play Maryland--the East's No. 1-seeded team--on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints also became the first team in 47 years to win an NCAA
tournament game with a losing record.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley is the team sharing the distinction--it won two in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Siena lost its last three regular-season games, leaving only one
path to the NCAA tournament. It won four Metro Atlantic Conference
tournament games on its home court to get the automatic bid.</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn State (21-10) had been unbeaten in play-in games in Dayton,
winning two in the 1980s under Coach Davey Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves spent a sleepless night getting to Dayton for this one,
then faced elimination at the end of a back-and-forth game that found
them at less than their best.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the last game for Whitney, a former Negro
League shortstop completing his 26th year at the Mississippi school.
Whitney, 72, hasn't decided whether to return for another season.</TE>
<TE>   Siena is only the 16th team in NCAA history to make the tournament
with a losing record and the first since Florida A&amp;M in 1999. Siena
had won only one other NCAA tournament game, defeating Stanford,
80-78, when it was seeded No. 14 in 1989. That was the year that
Siena changed nicknames, from Indians to Saints, and had to play
several home games in an empty gym because of a measles outbreak on
campus.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Trainer of Tiznow ends relationship with
stable after he is no longer allowed to work with Tizbud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Robbins, who trained Tiznow to do what no other horse has
done--win consecutive Breeders' Cup Classics--won't be training
Tiznow's brother, or any other horses from the same stable.</LD>
<LD>   Robbins said Tuesday that Tizbud, an unraced 3-year-old with the
same parents as Tiznow, sire Cee's Tizzy and broodmare Cee's Song,
has been moved to the barn of John Sadler, another trainer at Santa
Anita. As a result, Robbins told Mike Cooper, the managing partner of
the Tiznow stable, that he no longer wanted to train any of Cooper's
horses. Three of them, two unraced and the mare Cee's Elegance, will
be trained by Doug O'Neill at Hollywood Park, Robbins said.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper couldn't be reached for comment, but in the Daily Racing
Form he was quoted as having said, "Nothing is forever. I just
thought that this is what's best for Tizbud."</LD>
<TE>   Robbins said he was told that he was losing Tizbud in a letter
from Cooper two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that it was no reflection on my skills as a trainer,"
Robbins said, "and that he wanted to try the horse with a
higher-profile stable."</TE>
<TE>   The split between Cooper and Robbins is a bitter reflection of the
frequent tension between owners and trainers. Owners pay the bills,
and many of them expect to have a substantial say. Trainers usually
figure they know their horses better than the owners do. In the
Cooper-Robbins relationship, friction mounted last year after
repeated disagreements about Tiznow's racing schedule. In September,
Robbins said, he received a letter from Cooper that said that
Robbins' tenure was in jeopardy unless he consulted more with Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Tiznow, in his first race in six months, had just
finished third in the Woodward at Belmont Park. The options for a
final prep race for the Breeders' Cup were the Goodwood Handicap at
Santa Anita and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont, where the
Breeders' Cup was also going to be run. Robbins preferred the
Goodwood, which would save Tiznow an extra cross-country trip to New
York. He prevailed and the colt ran third in the Santa Anita race. In
2000, when Tiznow was voted horse of the year, Robbins had used a
victory in the Goodwood as a prep for the horse's first Breeders' Cup
win, at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Cecilia Straub-Rubens, who had bred Tiznow, raced the
horse with Cooper, a longtime friend and executive in her late
husband's beer distributorship. Weak with cancer, Straub-Rubens
watched Tiznow win at Churchill Downs, then three days later, died,
at 83, in a California hospital. Cooper raced Tiznow last year in a
partnership that included Straub-Rubens' two children.</TE>
<TE>   According to Robbins, the tension between him and Cooper went back
to last summer at Del Mar, where Tiznow, a horse struggling with back
problems, was attempting a comeback. He had won the Santa Anita
Handicap in March but hadn't raced since.</TE>
<TE>   "Right after Tiznow's fourth workout since coming back, [Cooper]
was telling Scott McClellan [jockey Chris McCarron's agent] that we
were running in the Pacific Classic [Aug. 19]," Robbins said. "Chris
and I had to sit down with [Cooper] for 45 minutes to explain to him
how the horse couldn't make that race. There would have been time for
only one more workout, and we would have been asking him to run a
mile and a quarter off just that. We didn't run, but I think it was
all downhill after that."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper told the Racing Form that friction between him and Robbins
was unrelated to the trainer's losing Tizbud.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins said he had called Cooper after getting the owner's second
letter. According to Robbins, Cooper suggested that they sit down and
talk.</TE>
<TE>   "The time to do that," Robbins said he told Cooper, "was before
you sent the letter."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his second Breeders' Cup win, Tiznow finished second to
Point Given, the preeminent 3-year-old, in the 2001 horse-of-the-year
voting, but Tiznow still won an Eclipse Award as the best older male
horse. Retired to stud after his second Breeders' Cup win, Tiznow
finished out of the money in only one of 15 starts, winning eight
times, and earned $6.4 million, which puts him eighth on the earnings
list of North American horses.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins, 56, said that he has seven horses in training. His stable
hasn't grown--and in fact might be smaller--since Tiznow's first
Breeders' Cup win. A recent chance to train a large draft of horses
for Stan Fulton, the owner of Sunland Park in New Mexico, quickly
soured and Robbins said that he and Fulton are no longer in business
together.</TE>

<HD>Sampson Has Taken Tribe-and-True Path</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Oklahoma basketball Coach Kelvin Sampson is a native son from another
state.</LD>
<LD>   Not many across the country know that Sampson, the onetime
Washington State coach who has guided the Sooners to No. 3 in the
nation, is a Lumbee Indian from North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   But in Oklahoma, where license plates are emblazoned with a
ceremonial shield and the words "Native America," precisely which
tribe he hails from is only a detail.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma was the destination on the Cherokees' infamous Trail of
Tears, the forced march across the country in the 1830s during which
thousands died as the U.S. government sought to remove them from
their homeland in the Southeast.</TE>
<TE>   The Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, Seminole, Cheyenne, Apache and
Pawnee are only a sampling of the many other tribes that call
Oklahoma home.</TE>
<TE>   In Sampson, they have a brother.</TE>
<TE>   "When they say he is Indian or Native American, the tribe doesn't
really matter," said Sydna Yellowfish, who organized a National
Indian Education Assn. youth meeting where Sampson spoke to some 500
Native American youngsters a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like the young lady in the Olympics, Naomi Lang,"
Yellowfish said, referring to the U.S. ice dancer. "It doesn't matter
which tribe. [Sampson is] just very inspirational."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's Lumbee Indians hold a small but remarkable place in
modern North Carolina history.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, several Lumbee men made national news when they broke up
a Ku Klux Klan rally near Maxton, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's father, John "Ned" Sampson, was among those pictured on
the several pages Life magazine devoted to the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my father tell my son the story," Sampson said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were going to have a big cross-burning or whatever, and the
Indian guys decided to protect their turf and say, 'We're not going
to allow this.'</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody in my father's group shot a light out, and the gunfire
started. People were running all different directions. Indian guys
were jumping under cars and people were throwing rocks and bottles."</TE>
<TE>   About 350 Lumbee men broke up the gathering when they stormed
about 100 Klansmen, only one of them hooded at the time. Though a
couple of men were grazed by shotgun pellets, no one was killed--and
that rally was never held.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson's career has taken him far from his boyhood home in
Pembroke, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a high school basketball coach, he grew up wanting to
be like two men. One was his father. The other was Dean Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson, 46, played basketball at what was then Pembroke
State--now North Carolina Pembroke--and began his coaching career as
a graduate assistant at Michigan State. Two years later, he became
the coach at Montana Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after that, at only 31, he was named coach at
Washington State, the most notoriously difficult job in the Pacific
10.</TE>
<TE>   The only coaches who've won 20 games in a season at Washington
State since 1949 are George Raveling and Sampson.</TE>
<TE>   Each did it twice, Raveling in 1980 and '83 and Sampson in '92 and
'94, the Cougars' last NCAA tournament appearance and his last year
in Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   "We really, really had it going," said Sampson, who would have had
Mark Hendrickson and Isaac Fontaine back from that team. "I didn't
want to leave so bad. I really wanted to stay. Oklahoma was looking
for a coach, and I dreaded their calls."</TE>
<TE>   He dreaded the media's more.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the wrong people chasing Osama bin Laden," said Sampson,
who was in the stands at a Seattle Mariner game when a TV crew
tracked him down. "It ought to be athletic directors and reporters.
They'll find you."</TE>
<TE>   But despite his reluctance, it was, after all, Oklahoma--a team
that had played for the national championship in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson finally took the job.</TE>
<TE>   He has thrived, taking Oklahoma to the NCAA tournament every year,
and reaching the Sweet 16 in 1999 with a team led by Eduardo Najera.</TE>
<TE>   But March has not been the Sooners' finest month. They were upset
in the first round last season by Indiana State and have lost in the
first round five of Sampson's seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   This year could be different. Oklahoma (27-4) beat Maryland by 16
early in the season and upset top-ranked Kansas on Sunday, winning
the Big 12 tournament title--a feat many thought would earn them a
No. 1 seeding.</TE>
<TE>   But the NCAA tournament committee admitted it had designated
Oklahoma as No. 2 in the West even before the Big 12 game ended.
Cincinnati was given the No. 1, and the second-seeded Sooners open
Friday in Dallas against Illinois Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   With a team led by Hollis Price, an ebullient and resilient guard
who overcame a gruesome arm injury suffered in the first-round loss
to Indiana State last season--a chip of an opponent's tooth was found
in his elbow--Oklahoma might not face a serious challenge until the
regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   That game could be against Arizona or Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   An Arizona matchup would bring great speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson has resisted annual overtures from other schools.</TE>
<TE>   But Lute Olson is 67, and Arizona's athletic director is Jim
Livengood--the athletic director at Washington State when Sampson was
there.</TE>
<TE>   How much longer Olson will coach remains to be seen, but when he
retires, Sampson would seem to be a fine choice, given his knowledge
of the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "I was comfortable in Pullman, I really was," he said. "I liked
coaching in an underdog situation. I liked the fact that we weren't
supposed to win. I liked beating UCLA and Stanford. We never did beat
Arizona, though."</TE>
<TE>   If Sampson ends up in Tucson, he will find another Native American
community that will identify with him.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Robeson County, N.C.--at that time said to be a
stronghold of the Klan--Sampson was part of a society he calls
"tri-racial: black, white and Indian."</TE>
<TE>   Water fountains were marked "White," "Colored" and "Other."</TE>
<TE>   He drank out of the one marked "Colored" because he never
considered himself "Other."</TE>
<TE>   "You could divide it if you want, but really it was two
sides--white and minority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson says he had a normal childhood, but he remembers a family
Christmas shopping trip to Fayetteville when his parents saw what
appeared to be a bonfire ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge rally, and they were burning a cross," Sampson
said. "My parents were contemplating whether to put us in the trunk."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only African Americans who had learned to fear the Klan.</TE>
<TE>   "We sure weren't going to say we were Lumbee," Sampson said. "Then
they'd say, 'Weren't you the guys who shot at us?'"</TE>
<TE>   Even in Oklahoma, Sampson's roots aren't widely known.</TE>
<TE>   But every year, he speaks to groups of Native American high school
students before Oklahoma football games during their visits to campus
as prospective students.</TE>
<TE>   He has visited the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe in Concho, Okla., among
other groups, and once was named the American Indian Exposition's
Outstanding Indian of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   There are more requests than Sampson can fulfill.</TE>
<TE>   But he understands.</TE>
<TE>   "God put me here," he said.</TE>

<LD>I make my living being a sports expert, so when it came time for
someone to win the NCAA tournament office pool a year ago, it really
shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone here who emerged on top.</LD>

won't be eating at Tom &amp; Aida's house any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   I'm telling you, if someone had asked, I would have told them the
Diamondbacks were going to win the World Series, the Grand Rapids
Rampage would take the Arena Bowl, and Walter Ray Williams Jr. would
roll his way to the PBA National Championship in Toledo.</LD>
<TE>   That's just what I do, so you can see how unfair it would be for
me to enter the office pool again--competing with people here, who
really don't know very much.</TE>
<TE>   I look at Vic sitting at his desk here on company time, appearing
clueless while filling out his bracket, and I realize this is his
only shot at a raise this year.</TE>
<TE>   I sit next to Alan, who writes Olympic stories no one ever reads,
and when he talks I notice no one ever listens. He has a loud voice,
however, and the other day I heard him tell himself he won the office
pool once, and it bothered me all day trying to remember when I must
have filled out that bracket for him.</TE>
<TE>   I can only imagine the guesswork that must be going on for those
working in our Southern California Living section--those poor people,
who'd like to be as smart as a Page 2 columnist just for a day, in
order to have a shot to win an office pool.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I've decided to help and provide the kind of expertise
you've come to expect here. Now if someone mentions previous
predictions that supposedly ran here that maybe had Denver winning
the Super Bowl this year, Jacksonville last year and UCLA playing
Texas in the Rose Bowl, all I can tell you is ... I plead ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SOUTH: Winthrop starts the year with Lander; ends with Duke;
"Cornbread'' Maxwell led Charlotte to '77 Final Four--Maxwell has no
more eligibility so Irish win; Rick Majerus and Bill Dwyre were both
born in Sheboygan--too much for Majerus to overcome so Indiana wins;
Wilmington 0-21 lifetime against ranked opponents, 0-22 after playing
USC; Penn is Ivy League team, Cal isn't--Cal wins; Central
Connecticut has same nickname as Duke--that's all; Kent State has
higher Sagarin rating than USC, who could beat OSU; Florida Atlantic
Coach Sidney Green is 58-112 overall, and you have problems with
Steve Lavin?</TE>
<TE>   Dwyre went to Notre Dame--too much for Irish to overcome against
Duke; In the last 29 games that Hoosiers have scored 75 or more
points they're unbeaten--USC has given up more than 75 in last
three--Indiana wins; Pitt romps in home game; Kent State runs
Cinderella winning streak to 20.</TE>
<TE>   Duke and Pitt eventually meet with Duke advancing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE WEST: Boston has a fine law school. Cincinnati has a fine
basketball team. BU's only chance is to sue the Bearcats; Ole Miss
can't stop Dan Gadzuric--question is does UCLA stop him? Missouri
shows me nothing; "Let's Dance Again" T-shirts to commemorate
Davidson's invite available--Ohio State, though will be doing the
slam dancing; How can team known as the Pokes keep up with Zags?
Gauchos were seeded third in Big West, Arizona third seed in NCAA.
Enough said; Hawaii unleashes amazing three-point attack; It's RIP
for Illinois Chicago with RPI of 124.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati's Bob Huggins could be coaching Clippers; instead he's
beating UCLA; Miami might beat Ohio State in football, but not
basketball; Gonzaga makes a point; Hawaii loses to Oklahoma--has to
go home to Hawaii, which makes Hawaii bigger winner than Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State and Oklahoma eventually meet with Oklahoma advancing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MIDWEST: Holy Cross is 2-12 when trailing at half--what's its
record when losing by 20 after three minutes? I've seen Stanford
play--take Western Kentucky; Creighton is located in Nebraska--go
with Florida; If Tony Gwynn still played for San Diego State,
Illinois would be concerned; Boston College doesn't belong in
tournament--Texas demonstrates why; Ditto for McNeese State;
Pepperdine just has to avoid playing Gonzaga; Montana just happy to
get out of Montana for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas wonders when it will play someone tough; Illinois wins in
Chicago; Mississippi's mascot is named "Bully," and Texas learns why;
Oregon watches USC and UCLA tape and doesn't let Pepperdine pull a
fast one.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas and Oregon eventually meet with Kansas advancing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE EAST: The only thing standing between Siena and a .500 record
is Maryland; editor Mike Kupper is Dwyre's friend and he likes
Wisconsin to go to Final Four--take St. John's in first round; Isn't
Tulsa close to Nebraska? Take Marquette; I knew a girl who went to
Valparaiso--she was cold--I worry its shooters might be the same way;
Given Bobby Knight's NCAA record, Texas Tech would be better off with
Brian Dennehy coaching; Is UCLA now a step up or down for Georgia's
Jim Harrick? Michigan State's my sleeper; Hampton beat North Carolina
and thought it was big, not knowing that would be as big as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland dines on cupcakes; Marquette has won 19 of 26 by 10 or
more points and whomps Kentucky; Georgia ends SIU's "we beat Knight
party;'' My sleeper catches Connecticut napping.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland and Georgia eventually meet with Maryland advancing.</TE>
<TE>   That means Kansas beats Maryland, and Oklahoma defeats Duke with
the Jayhawks winning it all, giving Lavin the chance to tell everyone
during the off-season he figured out a way to beat the national
champions.</TE>

<HD>Strawberry Jailed in Florida</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OCALA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Darryl Strawberry was jailed Tuesday, his 40th birthday, for breaking
a rule at the drug-treatment center where he had been serving two
years of house arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Florida Department of Corrections officials did not provide
details. The eight-time major league All-Star did not leave the
program or test positive for drugs, said Joe Papy, supervisor of
probation services in Tampa.</LD>
<LD>   Strawberry was being held without bond in the Marion County Jail
and was kicked out of the drug-treatment program at Phoenix House, a
residential facility about 80 miles north of Tampa. He was scheduled
to appear this morning at the Marion County Judicial Center.</LD>
<TE>   As deputies were escorting him to the jail, Strawberry said he was
confused by his arrest, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.</TE>
<TE>   "They just said I was discharged from the program," Strawberry
said outside the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry said he had not been accused of fighting or other
infractions at the center.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry was sentenced in May to two years of house arrest at
the center following a four-day, cross-state drug binge.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry faces up to 18 months in prison for violating his
probation, which he has violated five times.</TE>

<LD>A look at the top 10 boys' tennis teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Irvine University (2-1, SS-Div. II)</LD>
<LD>   Consensus is the Trojans are still the best, despite early loss to
Peninsula. (No. 1 last week)</LD>
<TE>   2. Corona del Mar (5-0, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Despite tough schedule, the balls bounce the Sea Kings' way.
Brothers Cameron and Carsten Ball are a combined 16-5 in singles. (3)</TE>
<TE>   3. Los Alamitos (1-1, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McQuaid beat the Ball brothers but lost to his
junior-circuit doubles partner, Garrett Snyder, in loss to Corona del
Mar. (4)</TE>
<TE>   4. Troy (6-1, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Twins Edward and Edwin Mendoza do the job in doubles for Warriors,
who won Glendora tournament last week. (10)</TE>
<TE>   5. Harvard-Westlake (3-0, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen Josh Lederman, Sam Wagner and Bret Thacher have played
well for Wolverines, who lead Mission League. (5)</TE>
<TE>   6. Woodbridge (4-1, SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   Erik Oijala didn't play against Servite, and Warriors missed a
victory on points in tiebreaker of an outstanding match (6).</TE>
<TE>   7. Westlake (4-0, SS-Div. III)</TE>

<HD>Tyson Finds a Place to Fight</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Former two-time heavyweight champion receives a
license for possible title bout in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The members of the D.C. Boxing and Wrestling Commission were not
about to be swayed, not by the ruling of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, not by the opposition of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), not
by the protestations of women's groups across the country, not by the
outrage of Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, and not even by the past actions
of Mike Tyson himself.</LD>
<LD>   In a hearing Tuesday night at Ashburn, Va., the three
commissioners voted unanimously to give the former two-time
heavyweight champion a boxing license.</LD>
<LD>   Whether he uses it for a proposed title match against champion
Lennox Lewis on June 8 at MCI Center remains to be seen. Michigan and
Tennessee also are viable contenders for the fight.</LD>
<TE>   While Detroit and Memphis, the proposed sites, are negotiating for
a site fee between $12 million and $13 million, which was the amount
pledged by Las Vegas' MGM Grand hotel when it was the proposed site,
there would be no site fee at the MCI Center.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center officials had expressed an interest in the match,
but, with a gubernatorial campaign going on, creating an uncertain
political climate, Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, has backed off
from his early enthusiasm about bringing the fight to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Also still to be determined is Lewis' willingness to go along with
such a match. Said Lewis last month: "I want to make clear, as I have
already told the Tyson camp, that Mike Tyson must get some
psychiatric help before we go forward in June."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis alleges Tyson bit him in the thigh at the bottom of a pileup
in January when a news conference to announce the fight at a New York
City hotel turned into a brawl after Tyson took a swing at a Lewis
bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada commission subsequently denied Tyson's bid for a
license to hold the match at Las Vegas. In turning him down, the
Nevada commissioners cited Tyson's failure to get his life in order
since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in a 1997 title fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the application. That's what it is," Michael Brown,
vice chairman of the Washington commission, said after Tuesday's
vote. "It's an application for a boxing license, nothing more,
nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be frivolous for us to stand up here and not be
concerned about Mr. Tyson's past."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mayor Anthony A. Williams has promised "a safe
environment" if the fight is held in his city.</TE>
<TE>   McCain has publicly objected to the fight being held in
Washington. Various women's groups have opposed Tyson, who was
convicted of rape a decade ago and served three years in prison. When
it appeared the fight might be headed for Georgia, Barnes called
Tyson "a sexual predator."</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada denial came after a hearing that portrayed Tyson
negatively, but Tuesday night's vote came in a much more favorable
setting. Sixty speakers in the two-hour session supported Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to be licensed in Washington D.C.," Tyson, who was
not present, said in a statement. "I applaud their decision and will
give the fight fans in the District the fight they deserve--the
chance to see me knock out Lennox Lewis in June."</TE>
<TE>   Tyson was interviewed by the commissioners last week and submitted
to medical and psychiatric tests.</TE>

<HD>Right Offensive Mix Is the Latest Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Commotion over motion is taking up a lot of UCLA practice time this
week.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins plan to use the 1-4 high-post offense they employed
most of the last three seasons and the four-out, one-in motion scheme
utilized the last three weeks in the first-round NCAA tournament game
against Mississippi on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll use a mixture," said assistant Jim Saia, the architect of
the 1-4. "When the 1-4 stalls, we can go to motion. Our veterans know
the 1-4 like clockwork, so we can spend time in practice on the
motion."</LD>
<TE>   The primary difference is that in the 1-4, center Dan Gadzuric
operates farther from the basket. The motion, which has Gadzuric
underneath the basket and the other four players on the perimeter,
allows the 6-foot-11 senior to go one-on-one in the paint and to be
in position for offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The motion is also unstructured, allowing the perimeter players to
set screens and make decisions unburdened by a script of set plays. A
drawback is that UCLA's top shooters--Jason Kapono, Billy Knight and
Matt Barnes--have trouble shaking their defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback is that freshmen point guard Cedric Bozeman and
Ryan Walcott lack the experience to make correct decisions every time
down the floor in the unstructured motion. They combined for 11
turnovers in the Pacific 10 tournament loss to California last week.</TE>
<TE>   "When we run two or three different offenses, it is more difficult
for freshman point guards," Saia said. "Cedric has been through so
much this season. His mind is in a whirlwind."</TE>
<TE>   Saia said he is not upset that Coach Steve Lavin went away from
the 1-4 so late in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When the 1-4 is run correctly, it's proven to be a great offense
for our players," Saia said. "But there are valid reasons to go with
the motion too. Going into the tournament it's a plus to have both
because [Mississippi] has to spend time preparing for both."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kapono, Gadzuric, Barnes and Knight were each selected most
valuable player at the Bruin awards dinner Monday, the first time in
memory four players shared the honor. Last season Kapono, Gadzuric
and Earl Watson were tri-MVPs.</TE>
<TE>   The same share-alike theme applied to the freshman of the year
award--Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson were honored.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Walcott was most improved player, T.J. Cummings took the
sixth-man award, Rico Hines was the outstanding defensive player and
Josiah Johnson was honored for academic achievement.</TE>

<DH>Trojans Take Nothing for Granted  After Season of
Buzzer-Beating Losses</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>USC lost four games on four improbable last-second shots this year.</LD>
<LD>   It takes four wins in the NCAA tournament for a team to advance to
the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   Paging Ms. Karma.</LD>
<TE>   "In the regular season, we thought we saw some crazy things," USC
senior forward Sam Clancy said. "But wait until we get into the
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The 18th-ranked Trojans' run begins Thursday against North
Carolina Wilmington in a South Regional game at Sacramento. And while
fourth-seeded USC is expected to handle the 13th-seeded Seahawks, the
Trojans insist that they are not looking past them and deeper into
their bracket.</TE>
<TE>   All USC has to do to stay grounded is remember that rash of
buzzer-beating losses this season. Plus, USC has been burned in the
NCAA tournament before by a last-second three-point prayer.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby, who often wears a cap with a Final Four
symbol sewed into it, said earlier this year that the nature of the
losses would only make the Trojans stronger for a possible postseason
sprint, that they built character.</TE>
<TE>   But even he had his fill of grief after Oregon's Frederick Jones
made a runner in the lane with one second on the clock, giving the
Ducks a come-from-behind 67-65 victory on Feb. 28 at the Sports
Arena. The loss knocked USC out of the regular-season Pacific 10
Conference title chase.</TE>
<TE>   "How much character do I want?" Bibby said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward David Bluthenthal began the Pac-10 tournament
saying that winning the three-day affair would ease the last-second
blues for the Trojans, who finished in a four-way tie for second
place.</TE>
<TE>   But after running out of gas in the second half of the
championship game Saturday against Arizona, the tune was the same.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a sting," Bluthenthal said. "We didn't win the
tournament. So once again we finished second in the Pac-10 and that's
a tough thing considering [the missed opportunities]."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was the first team to break USC's heart at the buzzer.
Craig Lewis banked in a three-pointer from 25 feet with 2.5 seconds
to play to give the Waves a 78-77 victory at the Forum on Dec. 6. USC
had led by 11 with 8:02 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Then California pulled it off twice in one night on Jan. 24. Brian
Wethers sank a three-pointer from the corner at the Sports Arena to
send the game into overtime before Shantay Legans beat the Trojans,
92-91, with a 26-footer from the left wing with three seconds
remaining in overtime. USC had led by 10 in the second half and by
four with 37 seconds remaining in the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Billy Knight was next to stick it to the Trojans on Feb. 6.
After a mad scramble for the ball under the basket, Knight found
nothing but net from the right wing as the Pauley Pavilion buzzer
sounded. The three-pointer gave the Bruins a 67-65 victory after USC
had led by nine late in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Jones' winner that clinched at least a share of the
league title for the Ducks in a game the Trojans had led by 11 with
11 minutes to go.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I stopped thinking about those last-second
shots," senior point guard Brandon Granville said. "I haven't been
thinking about those since the last one, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   But those shots have caused USC fans to relive the Trojans'
painful exit from the 1992 NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Harold Miner, USC was ranked eighth in the nation and
seeded second in the Midwest Region. After thumping Northeast
Louisiana, 84-54, USC was seemingly headed to the Sweet 16, with a
two-point lead over Georgia Tech with less than one second remaining.</TE>
<TE>   James Forrest, though, tossed in a three-pointer from 30 feet to
send the Trojans home.</TE>
<TE>   No one doubts that a sustained USC run over the next few weeks
would make accepting the Trojans' recent history of bad luck at the
buzzer more palatable. Just being seeded fourth, USC's highest NCAA
placing in 10 years, calmed Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're gone," he said of the memories of losing so many games at
the buzzer. "They finally left and I don't feel them at all. It's a
new season and we got a good seed."</TE>

<HD>Clancy Is Second Team All-American</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Once again, Sam Clancy found out about an honor that he was to
receive by hearing of it first from a relative.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Clancy's sister, Samantha, called him on his cell phone
to congratulate her big brother on being named the Pacific 10
Conference player of the year minutes before the league announced it
at a banquet.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday, as the USC senior forward disembarked from the plane at
the Sacramento airport, Clancy's mother, Anetta Harris, called him on
his cell phone.</LD>
<TE>   She told Clancy that he had been named second-team All-American by
the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister actually called my mom and told her first," said
Clancy, in Sacramento with USC preparing for the Trojans' first-round
NCAA tournament game against North Carolina Wilmington on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an Internet junkie."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but Clancy is racking up the awards.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7, 240-pound senior is USC's first All-American in 10
years, joining Harold Miner, who was named as a junior in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy has also been named a second-team All-American by the
United States Basketball Writers Assn. and a third-team All-American
by the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches.</TE>
<TE>   But the AP team is the most prestigious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice that once again people are recognizing me and my
accomplishments," said Clancy, averaging 19.0 points and 9.5
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was asking me if I get a plaque for it. I think so."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby said Clancy deserves any hardware.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a great year," Bibby said. "Like I said before, he's
carried this team all year."</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Wilmington feels USC's pain when it comes to
last-second losses.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the Seahawks' losses this season came during the game's
final possession, including Wake Forest's Darius Songalia's basket
with two seconds remaining to give the Demon Deacons a 79-78 win in
the preseason National Invitation Tournament.</TE>
<TE>   USC, which has played in 11 NCAA tournaments, is in its second
consecutive tournament for the second time since 1991-92. The only
other time the Trojans had played in back-to-back NCAA tournaments
was in 1960-61.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Wilmington is playing in its second NCAA
tournament.</TE>

<LD>Steve Klosterman might be considered a rarity these days, a transfer
without turmoil, a school-swapper who didn't leave behind a trail of
miffed teammates and scarlet-cheeked coaches.</LD>
<LD>   His high-profile move to Huntington Beach Marina High was picked
up by the transfer radar and didn't sound any alarms.</LD>
<LD>   He left Bellflower St. John Bosco after a successful sophomore
season for two reasons: He didn't like that the school was all boys
and he had friends at Marina with whom he played volleyball during
club season.</LD>
<TE>   One of only two sophomores on the All-Southern Section team last
season, the 6-foot-6 opposite hitter has quickly adapted to his new
school.</TE>
<TE>   "At Marina, everyone knows everyone ... and there's girls too," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Marina has adapted to him as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings defeated highly touted La Costa Canyon in a four-game
match March 5 and threw a scare into Manhattan Beach Mira Costa on
Tuesday, losing in four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings (6-2) haven't completely jelled--they were only
average at the San Diego tournament Saturday--but they appear to be
on their way to a surprise season.</TE>
<TE>   "What you usually think is, this is too good to be true," Marina
Athletic Director Paul Renfrow said. "Sometimes we benefit from
[transfers] and sometimes we don't. This one's been kind of nice.
Steve's a good kid and he's fitting in well here."</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco hasn't collapsed without Klosterman. With 6-6
middle blocker Kevin Cape, who has signed with Long Beach State, and
hard-hitting outside hitter Paul Spittle, the Braves won the Redondo
tournament and defeated Cerritos Valley Christian and Lakewood in
nonleague matches.</TE>
<TE>   "In some respects, you wonder what it would be like with him on
the team," St. John Bosco Coach Randy Totorp said. "You never like to
lose somebody with that kind of potential, but I think he is enjoying
himself more now.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a spur of the moment decision. Steven and the school
and I talked about it a lot. Overall, he wasn't completely happy. At
the same time, there was another school where he had great friends.
It really ended up being a good thing for him and based on the
results this year, it's turned out not to be a bad thing for us
either."</TE>
<TE>   Although Marina lost to Mira Costa, 15-11, 14-16, 17-15, 15-12, it
was the type of match Klosterman hopes to get used to at Marina.</TE>
<TE>   "They beat us this time, but maybe we'll see them down the road in
the playoffs," he said. "It was a fun one."</TE>
<TE>   Strong switch: By George, the position change has worked.</TE>
<TE>   Paul George, a setter last season at Chatsworth, has moved
seamlessly to opposite hitter, where he has excelled for the
Chancellors (2-0).</TE>
<TE>   George, a 6-5 senior, had 21 kills in a sweep of Monroe on Monday
and has the Chancellors looking like legitimate contenders for their
first City Section title since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul's too big and too dominant not to let him hit," Chatsworth
Coach Greg Saltzberg said. "And he still has the best hands [for
setting] on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Mustang might: Mira Costa (3-0) defeated Loyola and Marina in four
games, but Coach Mike Cook isn't quite satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still concerned about us," he said. "Our young kids have to
get a little bit older. They've got to keep getting better so we can
win the brass ring at the end of May."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Might Want to Take a Gambill</HD>
<DH>Tennis: American's strong play has put him in contention
for spot on Davis Cup team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Jan-Michael Gambill 1, James Blake 1.</LD>
<LD>   On the surface, it might have looked like a Davis Cup playoff
between closely matched opponents. Gambill evened his record against
Blake, winning, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, in the first round of the Pacific Life
Open Tuesday night at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</LD>
<LD>   But with Pete Sampras and Andy Roddick willing to play on grass
against Spain next month in the quarterfinals, U.S. Davis Cup captain
Patrick McEnroe is turning his attention to the doubles. Blake helped
himself by playing with Todd Martin in San Jose and Memphis, Tenn.,
and Mardy Fish here. Fish and Blake won a rare doubles point against
Slovakia in the first round in February.</LD>
<TE>   Gambill, who appeared out of the picture, has put himself back in
contention for consideration. He started 2002 by going 0-3, then went
to Hawaii to clear his psyche. After the break, he lost only three of
13 matches, reaching the semifinals in three consecutive tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I'm not really concerned about Davis Cup
right now," Gambill said. "I really have to focus on myself and
keeping myself healthy and healed up. I'm certainly not worrying
about it. What I'm excited about is that I'm injury-free now. Having
four months of injuries is very difficult, very hard on my psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing I could have finished last year top 15--if I just had a
couple of good results--was very difficult for me to deal with. I'm
just excited to be on the court. I'm really enjoying myself out
there, fighting as hard as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Gambill turned it around against Blake, a wild-card entrant,
despite losing the first set and needing treatment before the second
set on his sore right shoulder, a persistent problem, which caused
him to miss five weeks after the U.S. Open last year. The desert has
been a place for Gambill to excel, considering he reached the
quarterfinals at Indian Wells last year, defeating top-seeded Gustavo
Kuerten in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a game plan out there," said Gambill, who will play Jiri
Novak of the Czech Republic in the second round. "I stuck to it the
whole match. A lot of times I'll go out in my matches, serve big, hit
big groundstrokes, hope the guy hits shorts balls I can come in
on.... You know, he started making errors when I was attacking his
serve."</TE>
<TE>   Blake defeated Gambill a couple of weeks ago on his way to the
final in Memphis, winning, 6-4, 7-6 (8). Here, Blake felt he relaxed
too much after the first set, attempting to hit winners too early in
the point.</TE>
<TE>   "He obviously improved to put more pressure on me," Blake said. "I
didn't respond with my same game plan. I changed and tried to do too
much. The guys out here are too good to do that against."</TE>

<LD>Two of Orange County's top arts philanthropists Tuesday announced
their resignations from the Orange County Performing Arts Center's
board of directors, refusing to serve with fellow board members who
are suing their company in an unrelated dispute over high-tech
investments gone bad.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing their resignations, Henry Samueli and Henry T.
Nicholas III, the co-founders and top executives of Broadcom,
emphasized their continuing moral and financial support of the Costa
Mesa arts center. They said they hope it is not hurt by the business
dispute among some of its directors.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which the Broadcom executives dismissed as frivolous,
contends that Broadcom inflated sales and earnings by improperly
accounting for certain expenses.</LD>
<TE>   The stronger results boosted Broadcom's stock price, which allowed
Nicholas, Samueli and William J. Reuhle, chief financial officer, to
sell at least $80million in stock options before the company's shares
fell drastically last fall, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Among those suing Broadcom and its co-founders is Thomas T.
Tierney, who is in line to become chairman and chief executive of the
arts center in July. Tierney's office has referred all questions to
lawyers, who did not return calls for comment Monday or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Samueli said in an interview, "I and my partner cannot sit on a
board in which the incoming chairman and several members have filed
what we feel is a frivolous lawsuit.... That's something we can't
stomach. There's an integrity issue here. I have to have full
confidence in the people across the table."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, in a separate interview, said, "I would have no problem
sitting across the [table] from someone who sued me if there was an
honest difference of opinion. But I believe we haven't done anything
wrong, and they're trying to extort some kind of settlement."</TE>

<LD>Two of Orange County's top arts philanthropists Tuesday announced
their resignations from the Orange County Performing Arts Center's
board of directors, refusing to serve with fellow board members who
are suing their company in an unrelated dispute over high-tech
investments gone bad.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing their resignations, Henry Samueli and Henry T.
Nicholas III, the founders and top executives of Broadcom, emphasized
their continuing moral and financial support of the Costa Mesa arts
center. They said they hope it is not hurt by the business dispute
among some of its directors.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which the Broadcom executives dismissed as frivolous,
contends that Broadcom inflated sales and earnings by improperly
accounting for certain expenses. The stronger results boosted
Broadcom's stock price, which allowed Nicholas, Samueli and William
J. Reuhle, chief financial officer, to sell at least  $80 million in
stock options before the company's shares fell drastically last fall,
according to the suit.</LD>
<TE>   Among those suing Broadcom and its co-founders is Thomas T.
Tierney, who is in line to become chairman and chief executive of the
arts  center in July. Tierney's office has referred all questions to
lawyers, who did not return calls for comment Monday or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Samueli said in an interview, "I and my partner cannot sit on a
board in which the incoming chairman and several members have filed
what we feel is a frivolous lawsuit.... That's something we can't
stomach. There's an integrity issue here. I have to have full
confidence in the people across the table."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, in a separate interview, said, "I would have no problem
sitting across the [table] from someone who sued me if there was an
honest difference of opinion. But I believe we haven't done anything
wrong, and they're trying to extort some kind of settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Roger T. Kirwan, the center's chairman, said  the outside legal
dispute between board members does not mean there is a schism on the
board itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Differences of a personal nature have spilled over into an
unfortunate and ugly-looking lawsuit, but it has nothing to do with
the Performing Arts Center," Kirwan said. "We just happen to be the
focal point because [key opposing litigants] happen to be members."</TE>
<TE>   Other center board members suing Broadcom are Robert J. Follman,
the board's vice chairman for development; Benjamin R. Du, its vice
chairman for donor relations; and Thomas E. Tucker. None could be
reached for comment Tuesday. Lawrence M. Higby, the board's
secretary, also is listed as a plaintiff. But he said Monday that he
has asked lawyers to withdraw his name from the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The defection of Nicholas and Samueli from the center's board
coincides with a lull in its $200-million campaign to build a new
2,000-seat concert hall and a 500-seat theater next to the existing
3,000-capacity Segerstrom Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The center has raised $96 million since the campaign began in
1999, but only $1.8 million in the last five months, a period of
post-Sept. 11 anxiety and  a national recession. Center officials say
such lulls are commonplace in large fund-raising drives; they still
believe the money can be raised and construction begun in time for
the planned 2005 opening of the new halls.</TE>
<TE>   Samueli and his wife, Susan, contributed $10million to the
expansion campaign about three years ago--the second-largest gift
after $40million donated by Henry T. Segerstrom, the Costa Mesa
shopping center mogul who has been the center's leading donor. An
outdoor plaza connecting the new wing to the existing center is to be
named Samueli Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas anonymously donated $3.9 million to the center around the
same time but announced this gift Tuesday to underscore his support
for the center, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Broadcom partners said they decided to resign from the board
immediately after learning of the suit, which was filed Feb. 13 in
Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   They said they had hoped to resign quietly to avoid public
disharmony that might be uncomfortable for the performing arts
center. That plan changed with a report about the lawsuit in
Tuesday's edition of The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want this to turn into a messy situation [for the
center]," Samueli said when asked whether he and his partner had
considered staying on the board despite the suit against them.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, with the publicity, it will."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas and Samueli both said they felt blindsided by the suit.
"I actually considered Tom Tierney and the others my friends,"
Samueli said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been in my home; I've been in their home. I'm quite
disappointed. I had no idea it was coming, and neither did
[Nicholas]."</TE>
<TE>   Samueli had been on the board since December 1998 and Nicholas
since July 1999, according to a center spokesman. Tierney has been a
board member since 1986, the year the center opened.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas R. Kendrick, who was the center's president from 1985 to
1993 and remains on the board, said he could not recall any previous
instance of a lawsuit between board members.</TE>
<TE>   Kirwan, the center chairman, said he regrets the departure of the
Broadcom partners while welcoming their pledges of continued support.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks the resignations will defuse the  potential for division
within the center's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "By them stepping aside, there should be nobody in that room with
animosity."</TE>
<TE>   Kirwan said the resignations should settle the matter as far as
the center is concerned; all that's left for the 49 remaining board
members to do, he said, is "to acknowledge and thank them for their
service."</TE>
<TE>   However, Mark Chapin Johnson, who preceded Kirwan as chairman and
now chairs the center's capital campaign, thinks the matter calls for
some "soul searching" by the board.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have an event of this magnitude that involves people of
this visibility and generosity leaving your board and not have some
discussions about it."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the performing arts center have talked about the
importance of cultivating the high-tech industry for support;
historically, the center has gotten the bulk of its donations from
real estate and old-economy business interests.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that high-tech executives Mark S. Howlett and Nick
Shahrestany are still on the center's board, but the resignations of
Samueli and Nicholas "sure won't help" with high-tech outreach.</TE>
<TE>   "It will certainly require some work and cultivation on our part
as board members to offset and overcome" possible fallout in
high-tech circles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas and Samueli said they would be glad to continue helping
the center cultivate donors in the high-tech sector.</TE>

<HD>2 Girls Killed as Car Jumps Curb at School</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: The Anaheim students were waiting to be picked up
when a driver may have hit the gas instead of the brake, pinning them
to a wall.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two young girls were killed outside an Anaheim school Tuesday
afternoon when a car jumped a curb in the driveway and crushed them
against a wall.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred in a congested pick-up and drop-off zone in
front of Centralia Elementary School as about 300 students were
leaving for the day. Second-grader Bianca Perez, 7, of Buena Park
died instantly; Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, a first-grader from Anaheim,
died later at a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Nidia's mother and 3-year-old brother, Samir, had walked to school
to pick her up and were standing just a few steps away when she was
hit. Nidia had crouched down to pick up her backpack when the car
lurched forward and struck the girls. Her brother was a witness, said
Nidia's father, Armando Curiel, 27.</LD>
<TE>   "He saw everything," Curiel said Tuesday evening, sobbing as
friends tried to comfort him outside the small mobile home they share
with another family. "He saw the blood. He saw his sister die."</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's mother was inconsolable Tuesday night, her husband said.
As Curiel spoke, Samir walked from one adult to another, saying, "The
car hit her. The car hit her."</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's schoolmate Bianca had just started at Centralia last week,
said her uncle Luis Herrera, who arrived to pick up his two daughters
and niece Tuesday just after the accident. Both daughters, Stephanie
and Melissa, ages 7 and 6, were next to Bianca, he said, but saw the
car coming in time to scramble out of the way, yelling for their
cousin to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Maria Juarez, 50, of Anaheim, told police she was
picking up a relative when she lost control of her car, perhaps
accelerating instead of hitting the brakes, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez had backed into an unauthorized red zone where trash
receptacles are stored, police said, and was exiting that temporary
parking spot at 2:23 p.m. when her red Dodge crashed. Drugs and
alcohol were not a factor, and Juarez was not arrested or cited,
though police planned to talk to her again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still piecing everything together," Sgt. Rick Martinez
said. "This is a very safe and well-monitored campus. We haven't had
any problems. At this point, this is just a very tragic accident."</TE>
<TE>   Breanna Torrence, 8, who witnessed the accident, said the girls
were "just talking" while near the curb.</TE>
<TE>   The driver "ran into the two girls and bumped their heads into the
wall," Breanna said.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 children saw the accident, police said. School officials
called their parents, and the children spoke to crisis counselors
before leaving campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared," Breanna said. "I just ran. I won't see them
again....They were nice. We play at recess. I think it was sad. My
friend thought it was sad too. We both started crying."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Heather Rodriguez said her daughter also witnessed the
accident. As she was leaving the school Tuesday evening, she hugged
her 8-year-old daughter, Kristine, and said tearfully, "I'm having a
hard time dealing with this. I'm broken up a lot. She doesn't realize
what happened to the girls. It's going to be a lot to deal with in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the school, teachers and parents hugged each other, some
crying, others dazed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most tragic and heartbreaking event that can happen
in a school district," said Bobbi Mahler, superintendent of the small
Centralia School District, which covers parts of Anaheim, Buena Park
and La Palma.</TE>
<TE>   She fought back tears as she spoke: "These children were doing
what they were supposed to be doing. The car jumped the curb and ran
into the building."</TE>
<TE>   Armando Curiel said he rushed from the Diamond Bar construction
site where he was working to the hospital after a friend phoned him
about the crash.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, the family had returned to their home, just a couple
of blocks from the school.</TE>
<TE>   He stood outside their home and spoke lovingly of his daughter,
stopping often when overcome by grief.</TE>
<TE>   Her Christmas present, a purple Huffy bicycle, was parked nearby.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, with short black hair and big round cheeks, loved
cooking scrambled eggs and studying. Though she moved to the United
States from Mexico just over a year ago, she quickly picked up
English.</TE>
<TE>   "When she got to school, she spoke no English, but she learned
really fast," Curiel said. "She helped the other kids who didn't
speak English well with their homework."</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of dreams that have been halted by this accident,"
he said. "Her biggest dream was to go to Disneyland, and I never got
to take her."</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been no other serious accidents at the school,
several parents questioned the safety and design of the L-shaped
drop-off zone, a small, two-lane area that they said is often
congested, chaotic and inadequately monitored by school personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a problem in this school and it is called traffic,"
said Greta Dixon, 67, who was picking up her granddaughter Tuesday
afternoon. "They don't slow down for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Tammy Syphax, 42, agreed: "This driveway is not wide at
all. It's just frustrating. I've had a couple of arguments with
parents double-parking. I think it is the only thing screwed up--this
parking lot. This school is a very good school. This staff works
really hard."</TE>
<TE>   Another parent, Claudia Hernandez, 31, said parents often drive
too quickly through the lot, while others drive in the wrong
direction when trying to maneuver around parked cars.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always a lot of cars," Hernandez said. "They come
through both ways, and it is hard for them to come out."</TE>
<TE>   Mahler said the school has not received any specific traffic
complaints but emphasized that children are constantly reminded to
stay on the sidewalk and be careful not to dart out into traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We want parents to know that safety is and remains our No. 1
priority," Mahler said.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about parking-lot procedures probably on a daily basis. I
think we have to continue doing what we have been doing, which is
educating people regarding safety."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said they plan to meet today to discuss ways to
improve safety.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic and close calls have been problems at many schools in
Orange County, where overcrowding on campuses also means that school
driveways are accommodating many more cars than they were designed to
handle.</TE>
<TE>   A similar accident occurred Jan. 30 at a private elementary school
in Eagle Rock when a 65-year-old woman accidentally drove into a row
of students waiting for their rides. Fifteen children and three
teachers were injured, four of them severely.</TE>

<HD>Citing Higher Costs, O.C. Board Raises Parking, Other
Airport Fees</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Squeezed by higher costs and fewer passengers since Sept. 11, John
Wayne Airport will boost parking fees to $17 a day, up from $11, and
raise hangar and aircraft storage fees, starting April 1.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County supervisors approved the changes Tuesday, citing
higher insurance, security and operating costs.</LD>
<LD>   "The public-safety costs at our airport have gone up dramatically,
and it's our job to cover that," Supervisor Todd Spitzer said.
"Airports will never be the same again."</LD>
<TE>   John Wayne Director Alan Murphy said the airport is facing a
$3-million loss for the fiscal year ending June 30, but he and other
officials project that the rate increases will put the facility back
in the black next year.</TE>
<TE>   Airports nationwide have raised fees to deal with added security
and other costs since the attacks. Recently, parking fees at Los
Angeles International Airport rose to $30 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson challenged Murphy, asking whether planning
costs for an airport at the closed El Toro Marine base were the
reason for the projected loss. About $11.8 million in John Wayne
funds was earmarked for El Toro airport planning for fiscal 2001-02.
That funding is to end with last week's voter approval of Measure W,
which changed zoning at the former base from airport to park.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said the costs of El Toro planning were not the only reason
for the rate increases. Passenger travel dropped 15% after Sept. 11,
he said, and is still down 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "We also had higher insurance costs because of 9/11," he said. "I
don't think we would have been asking for funds other than because of
Sept. 11."</TE>

<LD>Candidates seeking to unseat an Orange County judge accused of child
molestation were sent notices late Tuesday from Ronald C. Kline's
attorney stating that his client wants to remove his name from the
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The fax to the 11 write-in candidates asked whether they would
approve or oppose a legal motion by Kline to pull out of the November
election. The fax from attorney Paul Meyer states that Kline will
take the issue to court Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The write-in candidates challenged Kline after he was charged with
child molestation and possession of child pornography. Because Kline
was not charged until after the filing deadline for the March 5
election, Kline's name was the only one on the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Kline received only 33% of the vote and is to face the top
voter-getter among the write-ins in the November election.</TE>
<TE>   The county registrar's office has spent the past week
hand-counting the ballots to determine which of the challengers would
face Kline. Election officials said they hope to announce a
preliminary result today.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Registrar Rosalyn
Lever said she was unaware of Kline's intention to pull out but
believed that, if he did so, the two top write-in candidates would
face each other in November.</TE>
<TE>   One of the write-ins to receive the fax, Dana Point attorney John
Adams, said Tuesday he did not know whether he would support Kline's
request because the ballot then would not reflect the will of some
voters.</TE>

<HD>Union Pacific Blamed for Delays</HD>
<DH>Transit: Metrolink operators say the railroad has breached
an agreement to keep the Riverside-L.A. route clear during rush hour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a strongly worded letter, the operators of Metrolink train service
between Riverside and Los Angeles blame Union Pacific railroad for
the commuter rail's repeated and lengthy delays.</LD>
<LD>   Metrolink Chief Executive David Solow accused Union Pacific of
demonstrating an inability or "unwillingness" to adhere to a
10-year-old contract that would improve on-time performance for the
passenger trains.</LD>
<LD>   "There are frequent examples of situations where Metrolink trains
are delayed for over 30 minutes, sometimes more than one hour," Solow
said in a letter delivered late last week.</LD>
<TE>   He blamed poor oversight and dispatching by Union Pacific, the
freight rail company that owns and manages the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials acknowledged the delays Tuesday and said they
are working to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we'll have a solution soon," spokesman Mike Furtney said.
"All we would ask is that they would be patient."</TE>
<TE>   The line, with trains 12 times daily, runs on time about 86% of
the time, according to Metrolink. The agency calls that level of
service unacceptable, particularly because it has 95% on-time
performance on its other trains, spokeswoman Sharon Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part is the size of the delays," Gavin said. "People
aren't just five minutes late, they are too often way late."</TE>
<TE>   But regular riders on the line couldn't care less about the
dispute, they just want an end to the logjam.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers aboard the 4:15 p.m. train leaving Los Angeles for
Riverside County on Tuesday talked about being constantly late for
work, about missing doctor appointments and birthday parties for
children while they sat, motionless, on Metrolink's gleaming
silver-and-blue trains.</TE>
<TE>   Some also complained pointedly that Metrolink was low-balling its
estimate on how often the trains are late.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-six percent?" asked Mary Bretthaver of Ontario. "Who are
they kidding? They are significantly late about half the time."</TE>
<TE>   A chorus of riders chimed in to agree.</TE>
<TE>   Added Sherman Breaux, a computer programmer who takes the train to
Riverside: "There are times you've got to wonder if this is all worth
it."</TE>
<TE>   Breaux, who like most other regular riders spends more than $150
on a monthly Metrolink pass subsidized by his employer, said he is
constantly tardy. Sometimes the delays are extreme.</TE>
<TE>   His trip, when running smoothly, should take just over one hour.
On a recent evening, Breaux said, it took him nearly five hours to
reach his home in Moreno Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink trains crisscross much of the Southland with a 416-mile
network connecting downtown Los Angeles with cities as far-flung as
Oceanside, Oxnard and Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   As is the case for commuter rail companies through much of the
country, Metrolink often must share crowded tracks with freight
trains.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the agency's trains run on rails controlled by
freight companies such as Union Pacific. The arrangement contributes
to delays that continually hamper passenger rail.</TE>
<TE>   Dispatchers, employed by the freight lines, must constantly decide
which trains should be allowed to run and which should be forced to
wait.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink and Union Pacific entered into a 1992 agreement giving
the commuter agency's trains priority during rush hour, in exchange
for its financing of $71 million in track improvements, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   That means Union Pacific dispatchers, watching over routes from
their centers in San Bernardino and Omaha, should give the commuter
trains the right of way, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Furtney agreed that is not happening enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure that everyone understands ... Metrolink
gets the priority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company, he said, is preparing an "action plan" to pound home
the rules with dispatchers on the Riverside county line.</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, that some of the delays appear to have been
caused by a recent order from the Federal Railroad Administration
that trains in the Riverside area be slowed until problems with some
of the rails are fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said his company's goal is to get Riverside's
on-time performance to about 95%.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin, however, said Metrolink has been haggling with Union
Pacific for at least nine years over the delays. "We've been through
this before," she said. "Now we want lasting results."</TE>
<TE>   In February, the delays in Riverside became so acute that
Metrolink decided to give its riders 25% discounts on their tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin said Metrolink may be forced to call in an outside
arbitrator, allowed for in a contract between the two sides, to solve
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink Riverside line carries about 4,500 passengers a day,
Gavin said.</TE>

<HD>Simple Suggestions for Mahony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Across the land, the Catholic Church is being forced to come clean
about the sins of the fathers, and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
appears to be falling into line. But the million-dollar word there is
"appears."</LD>
<LD>   As reported in The Times, Cardinal Roger Mahony recently dismissed
as many as a dozen priests for allegations of sexual abuse. But local
authorities said they hadn't gotten any calls from church officials
regarding those allegations.</LD>
<LD>   A reasonable person might ask, What gives? Does the church
consider itself to be above the law?</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, the archdiocese sent priests into pulpits to read a
statement from Mahony. My hat is off to the author, whether it was
Mahony himself, a team of lawyers or a high-priced flack, because it
was a beautiful piece of work.</TE>
<TE>   "Some press reports have implied that the archdiocese has not
passed along information on suspicions of child abuse to the proper
authorities," said the statement, which went on and on about Mahony's
knowledge of the legal requirements to report sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But despite assurances that the archdiocese will not tolerate
abuse, the statement brilliantly steered clear of saying whether
anyone actually did call the police. We have the appearance of the
diocese coming clean, but it was such a quick dunk, I'm not sure we
can call it a baptism.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains: Did they call police? And if not, why not?</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to give you the church's answers, which would be the fair
thing to do, if not the Christian thing. But no answers are
forthcoming. Archdiocesan officials did not return my calls. It's
possible they were busy siccing the cops on someone, but if so, why
not admit that they're finally playing hardball?</TE>
<TE>   You'd think they'd have learned the cost of silence and denial by
now, given the horrific pedophilia scandal in Boston, the humiliating
resignation of a bishop in Florida and a payout to victims nationwide
in the neighborhood of $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Look, the new cathedral is set to open in Los Angeles this
September. Wouldn't it be smart to clean out the closet now? I know
that if I'd donated hard-earned cash to the $200- million Rog Mahal,
I'd like to be certain it was spent on kneelers and prayer books
rather than molestation settlements.</TE>
<TE>   While holding out faith that the archdiocese would return my
calls, I talked to prosecutors George Palmer and Irene Wakabayashi in
the L.A. County district attorney's office, and here's the way I
figure it:</TE>
<TE>   There are so many loopholes in child abuse laws, it wouldn't be
hard for the Catholic Church or another institution to hide behind a
technicality and legally avoid calling the police in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   If a claim of sex abuse is made during confession, for instance,
the priest can keep it quiet because of clergy privilege. If the
alleged crime occurred before 1987 but was reported afterward, the
church doesn't have to call the police because clergy, for reasons
only the devil knows, essentially got a waiver prior to 1987.</TE>
<TE>   If an adult walks into a church today and tells a priest he was
molested as a boy, the priest doesn't have to call the police, even
if the abusive priest is still on the job. The law presumes the adult
can call the police himself.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the clergy only has to call the police, prosecutors
told me, if a minor makes a complaint. But is there anyone out there
who thinks a sexually abused child is going to march into the rectory
or the principal's office and file a complaint?</TE>
<TE>   It's as if the pope himself wrote these laws.</TE>
<TE>   But let's forget about legal requirements for a moment and talk
about a higher authority. Isn't there a moral obligation for the
church to report anything and everything that might root out
molesters before they abuse again?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there is, but they don't do anything unless they're
made to do it," says Mary Grant, who, as a teenager, was abused by an
Orange County priest in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The priest was not canned despite a diocesan cash settlement with
Grant. Only last year, after the priest confessed to me that he had
had several relationships with consenting women, was he dumped as
pastor of his church. He has since been sued for another alleged
molestation that goes back to the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Mahony established a policy designed, in his words, "to
do all that is humanly possible to prevent sexual abuse.... "</TE>
<TE>   In his Sunday statement, he invoked that policy and vowed that his
church "will not knowingly assign or retain a priest, deacon,
religious, or layperson ... when such an individual is determined to
have previously engaged in the sexual abuse of a minor."</TE>
<TE>   Well, given that the policy goes back 14 years, how is it that as
many as a dozen accused molesters were still on the payroll? Did
Mahony just now hear about them? And by the way, what exactly did
these priests do?</TE>
<TE>   The church has acknowledged six molestation complaints in the past
five years alone, but it's anyone's guess what, if anything, became
of those priests.</TE>
<TE>   Are they still hearing confessions?</TE>
<TE>   Some people in the church argue that Mahony has done more to crack
down on bad priests than his predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure how flattering a distinction that is, but there's a
simple way to restore some of the faith the church has burned.</TE>
<TE>   First, he can level with parishioners and the public about what he
knows and what he's doing about it. Second, he can invite the police
in and let them root through the files.</TE>
<TE>   In my Catholic school days, I was taught there are no secrets on
Judgment Day.</TE>

<HD>Community's Healing Begins Only After the Silence Is Broken</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the silence that strikes you.</LD>
<LD>   Not that Orange County at any time of day ever sounds like
Manhattan, but stroll around Rancho Santa Margarita on a weekday
afternoon and see if you're not taken by the soundlessness of the
place. You can drive up and down block after block in the city and,
literally, not hear anything.</LD>
<LD>   It's not as though this is a burg of 500 people. More than 47,000
live here. You wonder how that many people can make so little noise.
By contrast, neighbors Lake Forest and Mission Viejo sound positively
raucous.</LD>
<TE>   This is no insult to Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   It's that very quiet and serenity that help identify this
2-year-old city, a community laid out and designed for comfort, a
poster city for the good life in America.</TE>
<TE>   The city keeps pools heated year-round. A Sheriff's Department
spokesman refers to it as virtually "problem-free and crime-free."</TE>
<TE>   From some vantage points, you can see people on horseback. A
merchant jokes that the city of 40,000-plus has five Starbucks. One
small strip mall features two pet-care centers.</TE>
<TE>   Walk around this idyllic community built in the foothills and
backed by the Cleveland National Forest and all the suburban
stereotypes leap to mind.</TE>
<TE>   The town is peaceful and boring, and that's the way the residents
like it, thank you very much.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes the psychic pain rippling through part of
Rancho Santa Margarita all the more incongruous.</TE>
<TE>   The pain--and that is the correct word--stems from the recent
disclosures of sexual misconduct by a popular priest and by a former
high school principal.</TE>
<TE>   Both men--priest Michael Pecharich and principal Msgr. Michael
Harris--were more than figureheads in the community.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Solano Church and Santa Margarita High School, both
on the same plot of ground just down the road from the entrance to
upscale Coto de Caza, are centers of educational, cultural and
spiritual life in town.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Pecharich, the founding pastor at San
Francisco Solano, announced the end of his 12-year service. Harris,
the first principal at Santa Margarita, left several years ago and
was the central figure in a $5.2-million lawsuit settled by the Los
Angeles and Orange dioceses last year.</TE>
<TE>   One of San Francisco Solano's parishioners recently left me a
phone message.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only imagine the pain and fear and the healing process
that we're all experiencing at this time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of soul-searching and questions. As a devout Roman
Catholic, it's very difficult to pick up the paper. Not only after
what we've suffered here, but to see what's happening across the
country. It's devastating."</TE>
<TE>   It would be convenient to say that the privacy and semi-isolation
that mark Rancho Santa Margarita--not to mention its image as a
sanctuary from the larger society's problems--fostered the secrecy
over misdeeds at the local church and school.</TE>
<TE>   Convenient, but not accurate. Churches across the country have
come forward to reveal similar hushed-up situations.</TE>
<TE>   Nor am I suggesting that the revelations that have rocked
America's Catholics go down any smoother in bustling urban centers
like Boston than they do in tranquil communities like Rancho Santa
Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I'm noting the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that people are saying, 'This is Rancho Santa Margarita
and it couldn't happen here,'" a merchant tells me. "It's an awful
thing, but it's not being seen in terms of, 'We deserve better.' It's
our children who deserve better than that."</TE>
<TE>   The merchant, who didn't want to be identified, says the story
isn't the overlay of such awful allegations against the backdrop of a
tranquil community.</TE>
<TE>   "The story is that it's being flushed out by the church," he says.
"Our community is not above any other."</TE>

<HD>2 Girls Killed When Car Jumps Curb at O.C. School</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: The first- and second-graders were waiting to be
picked up when they were pinned against a wall by a driver who
reportedly hit the gas instead of the brakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI, DAVID HALDANE and KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two young girls were killed outside an Anaheim school Tuesday
afternoon when a car jumped a curb in the driveway and crushed them
against a wall.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred in a congested pick-up and drop-off zone in
front of Centralia Elementary School as about 300 students were
leaving for the day. Second-grader Bianca Perez, 7, of Buena Park
died instantly; Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, a first-grader from Anaheim,
was declared dead at West Anaheim Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Nidia's mother and 3-year-old brother, Samir, had walked to school
to pick her up and were standing just a few steps away when she was
hit.</LD>
<TE>   Nidia had crouched down to pick up her backpack when the car
lurched forward and struck the girls.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother was a witness, said Nidia's father, Armando Curiel,
27.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw everything," Curiel said Tuesday evening, sobbing as
friends tried to comfort him outside the small Anaheim mobile home
they share with another family. "He saw the blood. He saw his sister
die."</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's mother was inconsolable Tuesday night, her husband said.
As Curiel spoke, Samir walked from one adult to another, saying, "The
car hit her. The car hit her."</TE>
<TE>   Nidia's schoolmate Bianca had just started at Centralia last week,
said her uncle Luis Herrera, who arrived to pick up his two daughters
and niece Tuesday just after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Both daughters, Stephanie and Melissa, ages 7 and 6, were next to
Bianca, he said, but saw the car coming in time to scramble out of
the way, yelling for their cousin to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera recognized his niece's outfit--blue jeans and a white
T-shirt--and her pink Powerpuff Girls backpack. When he asked a
teacher what had happened, she said, "Don't look."</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Maria Juarez, 50, of Anaheim, told police she was
picking up a relative when she lost control of her car, perhaps
accelerating instead of hitting the brakes, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez had backed into an unauthorized red zone where trash
receptacles are stored, police said, and was exiting that temporary
parking spot at 2:23 p.m. when her red Dodge crashed. Drugs and
alcohol were not a factor, and Juarez was not arrested or cited,
though police planned to talk to her again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still piecing everything together," Sgt. Rick Martinez
said. "This is a very safe and well-monitored campus. We haven't had
any problems. At this point, this is just a very tragic accident."</TE>
<TE>   Breanna Torrence, 8, who witnessed the accident, said the girls
were "just talking" near the curb.</TE>
<TE>   The driver "ran into the two girls and bumped their heads into the
wall," Breanna said.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 children saw the accident, police said. School officials
called their parents, and the children spoke to crisis counselors
before leaving campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared," Breanna said. "I just ran. I won't see them
again.... They were nice. We play at recess. I think it was sad. My
friend thought it was sad too. We both started crying."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Heather Rodriguez said her daughter also witnessed the
accident. As she was leaving the school Tuesday evening, she hugged
her 8-year-old daughter, Kristine, and said tearfully, "I'm having a
hard time dealing with this. I'm broken up a lot. She doesn't realize
what happened to the girls. It's going to be a lot to deal with in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the school, teachers and parents hugged each other, some
crying, others dazed.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, several parents had set up a memorial to the two girls
with teddy bears, candles and a Spanish book of Scriptures. Behind
it, a wall of the school was dented from the crash, just under a sign
saying "Office."</TE>
<TE>   Janice Gregory was there with her two children lighting candles.
Their thoughts were with both the young girls and the driver. "Pray
for her as well," Gregory said. "It has to be the most horrible thing
to have to live with for the rest of your life."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most tragic and heartbreaking event that can happen
in a school district," said Bobbi Mahler, superintendent of the small
Centralia School District, which covers parts of Anaheim, Buena Park
and La Palma.</TE>
<TE>   She fought back tears as she spoke: "These children were doing
what they were supposed to be doing. The car jumped the curb and ran
into the building."</TE>
<TE>   Armando Curiel said he rushed from the Diamond Bar construction
site where he was working to the hospital after a friend phoned him
about the crash. By evening, the family had returned to their home,
just a couple of blocks from the school.</TE>
<TE>   He stood outside their home and spoke lovingly of his daughter,
stopping often when overcome by grief. Her Christmas present, a
purple Huffy bicycle, was parked nearby.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, with short black hair and big round cheeks, loved
cooking scrambled eggs and studying. Though she moved to the United
States from Mexico just over a year ago, she quickly picked up
English.</TE>
<TE>   "When she got to school, she spoke no English, but she learned
really fast," Curiel said. "She helped the other kids who didn't
speak English well with their homework.... We have a lot of dreams
that have been halted by this accident. Her biggest dream was to go
to Disneyland, and I never got to take her."</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been no other serious accidents at the school,
several parents questioned the safety and design of the L-shaped
drop-off zone, a small, two-lane area that they said is often
congested, chaotic and inadequately monitored by school personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a problem in this school and it is called traffic,"
said Greta Dixon, 67, who was picking up her granddaughter Tuesday
afternoon. "They don't slow down for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Tammy Syphax, 42, agreed: "This driveway is not wide at
all. It's just frustrating. I've had a couple of arguments with
parents double-parking. I think it is the only thing screwed up--this
parking lot. This school is a very good school. This staff works
really hard."</TE>
<TE>   Another parent, Claudia Hernandez, 31, said parents often drive
too quickly through the lot, while others drive in the wrong
direction when trying to maneuver around parked cars.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always a lot of cars," Hernandez said. "They come
through both ways, and it is hard for them to come out."</TE>
<TE>   Mahler said the school has not received any specific traffic
complaints but emphasized that children are constantly reminded to
stay on the sidewalk and be careful not to dart out into traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We want parents to know that safety is and remains our No. 1
priority," Mahler said.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about parking-lot procedures probably on a daily basis. I
think we have to continue doing what we have been doing, which is
educating people regarding safety."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said they plan to meet today to discuss ways to
improve safety.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic and close calls have been problems at many schools in
Orange County, where overcrowding on campuses also means that school
driveways are accommodating many more cars than they were designed to
handle.</TE>
<TE>   A similar accident occurred Jan. 30 at a private elementary school
in Eagle Rock when a 65-year-old woman accidentally drove into a row
of students waiting for their rides. Fifteen children and three
teachers were injured, four of them severely.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about safety already had led Nidia's family to forbid her
from riding her new bike to school, despite her pleas that many other
children were allowed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'Because we don't want you to have an accident or to
get run over,'" her uncle Jaciel Lugo said.</TE>
<TE>   Lugo comforted his sister, Sua Curiel, at the hospital Tuesday
afternoon as she recalled her last conversation with her daughter.
That morning, she had helped dress Nidia even though Nidia usually
dressed herself. When they were done, Nidia said, "Thank you, Mom.
God bless you."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, surprised, replied, "God bless you too." And when
Nidia said goodbye for the day, she said, "Take care of yourself,
Mom."</TE>

<HD>Cocaine Ring Is Blamed in Slaying of Venice Activist</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two murder suspects now in custody are among those
named in federal indictment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A violent cocaine ring that stretched from the Venice Shoreline Crips
to associates in Atlanta and Baltimore was responsible for the
killing of Venice community activist James Richards almost 17 months
ago, according to Los Angeles police and a federal indictment
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Two murder suspects are in custody on charges related to the
killing. A total of 22 people have been indicted on federal
narcotics-related charges connected to the investigation of the case.</LD>
<LD>   Richards, 55, was shot in front of his home in the Oakwood section
of Venice in the early morning hours of Oct. 18, 2000. His death was
quickly labeled an assassination by people close to the case.</LD>
<TE>   The federal indictment supports that assessment, saying the
conspirators killed Richards because they believed he ''was reporting
their narcotics activities to law enforcement.''</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that Maurice Brown, a suspect in the case
who is in federal custody, and his associates were involved in a
national cocaine distribution ring using a music company as a cover
for some of their operations. The conspirators traveled by plane and
strapped cocaine to their legs, the indictment alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment chronicles telephone calls between the alleged
members of the conspiracy in which they discussed killing people who
they believed were cooperating with law enforcement. It also says
that the conspirators chatted about putting plastic on the floor of
the music company's offices to make sure bloodstains would not ruin
things.</TE>
<TE>   Richards was the publisher of Neighborhood News, an online
newsletter that dealt with the area's crime problems, and was known
for listening assiduously to police scanners, sometimes arriving on
crime scenes before police.</TE>
<TE>   A member of several police-affiliated community groups and a
Neighborhood Watch block captain, Richards was said to sometimes go
so far as to take photographs of drug deals as they were happening.
Shortly before his death, officers had warned him to "lie low,"
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Richards' methods were sometimes controversial, but his death
provoked a strong community reaction. The murder was investigated by
the Los Angeles Police Department and a multi-agency task force that
has been examining drug dealing in the neighborhood. The task force
included investigators from the Drug Enforcement Administration,
Internal Revenue Service and Los Angeles Port Police.</TE>
<TE>   So far in the case, Los Angeles police have arrested one of the
suspected killers. Byron Lopez was arrested Feb. 26 on suspicion of
teaming with rival gang members to kill Richards. Lopez is also being
held on suspicion of murdering Juan Martinez, 21, in the 3300 block
of Beethoven Street in the Venice area about two months after
Richards was killed, LAPD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-year-old man was charged with two counts of murder and one
count involving possession of a firearm by a felon on Feb. 28, said
Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney. His arraignment has been continued to March 25.</TE>
<TE>   The second suspect, Brown, was identified in an indictment issued
in September as among several people who shot Richards, according to
federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, whose age was not disclosed, is also facing a number of
narcotics and weapons charges in connection with the conspiracy case.</TE>
<TE>   The case is scheduled to go to trial in April, said Thom Mrozek,
spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A third suspect in Richards' murder, Antwon Jones, is dead, the
LAPD said--killed last April in an unrelated gang assault in West Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they would announce  Brown's arrest at a news
conference today.</TE>

<HD>Health Aides Protest County's Secret Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home health-care aides and their elderly and infirm clients Tuesday
protested a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' secret vote to
kill an initiative that would raise the low-paid aides' wages.</LD>
<LD>   The aides, who contend the issue has put the integrity of the
board in question, are demanding that the board release all documents
and minutes of other closed sessions related to the initiative for
the last six months.</LD>
<LD>   "The integrity of this board is unequivocally in question today,"
said Tyrone Freeman, president of Service Employees International
Union Local 434B, which represents the workers. "If they refuse [to
provide the documents], we have to raise the question of their
conduct. What are they trying to hide?"</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors were divided in their reactions to the request. Gloria
Molina said through an aide that the group should be allowed access
to all documents related to its initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Don Knabe and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke both said the county counsel
would decide whether the documents are public record but said they
believe the documents are not public because state law allows
discussion in private of personnel matters and pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Zev Yaroslavsky said that he did not want to set a precedent of
releasing what he too believes are privileged documents but that he
would be open to having a third party, such as a retired judge,
review the documents for any signs of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the board has to bend over backward to prove itself now,"
Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   December Session Started Brouhaha</TE>
<TE>   The controversy involves a Dec. 18 closed session in which the
board voted 4 to 1 to instruct County Counsel Lloyd Pellman to ignore
his legal requirement to prepare a ballot title and summary for the
initiative, which would increase the health aides' salaries from
$6.75 to $11.50 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Without the title and summary, proponents of the initiative could
not begin to gather signatures to qualify it for the November ballot,
stopping the proposal in its tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The decision, opposed by Yaroslavsky, was not subsequently
announced to the audience attending that day's Board of Supervisors
meeting, as is usually required by law. County Counsel Pellman--who
made the original suggestion to avoid certifying the
measure--eventually reversed himself and did the required work.</TE>
<TE>   Even in that reversal, the workers and Molina contend, Pellman
violated open meeting laws. Documents show that he telephoned a
majority of the board without posting a notice of a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Knabe assert that Pellman did not include them in the
phone calls, so they did not know about his actions to reverse
himself until after they were taken.</TE>
<TE>   Union official Freeman said the fact that the measure was only
momentarily sabotaged does not lessen the misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "If a bank robber goes to the bank and holds it up--whether or not
he takes the money, it is still a bank robbery and he's still
prosecuted to the full extent of the law," he said. "This Board of
Supervisors has violated the law. They ought to be prosecuted to the
full extent of the law, just like that bank robber."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing the initiative's proponents complained last
week to the district attorney's office that the board violated open
meeting laws in the Dec. 18 meeting, during the serial telephone
calls and subsequent closed-door meetings to discuss what happened.</TE>
<TE>   A prosecutor in the Public Integrity Division is reviewing the
complaint to determine whether an investigation is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman denies that the board violated any open meeting laws.</TE>
<TE>   The board's actions were revealed last week when the county
refused a public records request by The Times but included the
documents sought with the denial letter. The county later said the
documents were released by mistake and asked for their return.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to us that a cover-up of the secret meetings would have
happened and the public would never have known how the board reached
its conclusion about an important issue that should have been debated
in the open if the Times reporter had not accidentally been given the
critical documents," Karen Ocamb of the Los Angeles Press Club told
supervisors during public comment Tuesday. "We of course look forward
to a full explanation of how these secret meetings came about and
whether this is an isolated incident or a pattern."</TE>
<TE>   Her group is requesting that the board review its open-government
ordinances to allow broader access to documents and discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity Has Helped Cause, Supporters Say</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the initiative said recent publicity about the
board's hostility to the measure has familiarized the public with the
issue and made it easier to gather signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the board's meeting room Tuesday, they set up poster-sized
photographs of home health aides and their clients and enlargements
of the notorious documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in L.A. County all my life and I'm appalled that five
of our representatives would try to do such a dastardly deed as not
even letting it go to the voters," said proponent Hugh Hallenberg
from his wheelchair. "I call on the Board of Supervisors to stop
trying to squash us before we've even had an opportunity to circulate
our initiative."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable for them to have secret meetings and
undermine democracy," said Julia Scoville of the Gray Panthers of
Long Beach. "Most of our members are seniors. Their biggest concern
is, as they age and become more and more disabled, that they can't
remain in their own homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the Board of Supervisors and their families will one
day be in the same situation," she added, "and would like to have
competent care."</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Father Receives 15 Years to Life for Fatally
Shaking Baby</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 26-year-old Simi Valley father who admitted shaking his infant son
to death was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years to life in prison after a
judge refused to allow him to take back his guilty plea.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney representing Brian Trelatsky argued that his client
did not know what he was doing when he pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder two months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer accused a public defender of failing to properly advise
Trelatsky of the consequences of the plea--namely that he could be
held in prison for the rest of his life.</LD>
<TE>   But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley rejected that
argument, praising the public defender for his thoroughness and
concluding that there was no evidence to suggest Trelatsky was poorly
advised.</TE>
<TE>   Riley then imposed the sentence negotiated two months ago in the
death of Trelatsky's 10-week-old son, Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters and police responding to a 911 call on March 28,
2000, found the child in cardiac arrest, lying on a coffee table in
the family's Simi Valley mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   The child died the next day. An autopsy showed that Tyler died
from trauma from an impact, shaking, or a combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky was arrested six months later and charged with child
abuse causing death, which carries a prison sentence of 25 years to
life.</TE>
<TE>   In January, he offered to plead guilty to a lesser charge on the
eve of trial, and prosecutors accepted.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, dressed in a blue jail uniform, said nothing during
Tuesday's sentencing hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona told the judge that the
case has devastated the family. The emotional fallout was evident in
court as the defendant's wife Catherine Trelatsky wept in the back of
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have done their best to represent Tyler during these
proceedings," Corona said. "We cannot bring Tyler back. What we can
do is make Brian Trelatsky accountable."</TE>

<LD>A 26-year-old Simi Valley father who admitted shaking his infant son
to death was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years to life in prison after a

the family's Simi Valley mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   The infant was taken to Simi Valley Hospital for initial
treatment, then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where doctors determined that he
had retinal hemorrhaging and brain swelling--symptoms consistent with
shaken-baby syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The child died the next day. An autopsy showed that Tyler died
from trauma from an impact, shaking, or a combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky was arrested six months later and charged with child

<TE>   Prosecutors argued at a preliminary hearing last year that
Trelatsky was to blame for the death because he was Tyler's sole
caregiver when the boy stopped breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's wife, Catherine Trelatsky, confirmed that her
husband and their 3-year-old son, Scottie, were the only people with
the baby between 7 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., when paramedics were summoned.</TE>
<TE>   But she also hinted that the older son could have caused the
injuries. She said the boy was jealous and sometimes hit the infant.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Trelatsky described her husband as a loving father--a
stay-at-home dad who roamed their neighborhood so much with his
children that he became known as "the man who walks the baby."</TE>
<TE>   In January, he offered to plead guilty to a lesser charge on the
eve of trial, and prosecutors accepted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the prison sentence, Trelatsky must pay for
counseling for Scottie, who, prosecutors say, witnessed the fatal
shaking.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, dressed in a blue jail uniform, said nothing during
Tuesday's sentencing hearing. His attorney, E.J. Montanez, gave no
closing remarks.</TE>
<TE>   But Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona told the judge that the
case has devastated the family. The emotional fallout was evident in
court as the defendant's wife wept in the back of the
courtroomalongside her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have done their best to represent Tyler during these
proceedings," Corona said. "We cannot bring Tyler back. What we can
do is make Brian Trelatsky accountable."</TE>

<HD>Unrelated Shootings Leave at Least 9 Dead</HD>
<DH>Violence: Several innocent bystanders are among victims of
eight attacks in 14 hours.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At least nine people, including several innocent bystanders, were
killed in a series of unrelated shootings in the Los Angeles area
that began Monday evening, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police on Tuesday said the roughly 14 hours of violence was far
from routine.</LD>
<LD>   "It is unusual to see this many homicides in one day, period,"
said LAPD Officer Jason Lee, a department spokesman. "It's a cause
for concern. We're going to use our gang and narcotics units and all
our resources to find out why these killings are occurring, and what
we have to do."</LD>
<TE>   In one case, a San Bernardino woman and a Los Angeles man were
fatally shot by unknown assailants about 7 p.m. Monday as they stood
talking on a street corner.</TE>
<TE>   Ruby Ceasar, 54, died at the scene of the shooting at South
Figueroa and West 84th streets, and Derrick Brooks, 41, died at a
hospital from a gunshot wound to the head, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "They just happened to be in the area ... and got caught in the
cross-fire," said LAPD homicide Det. Rudy Lemos. .</TE>
<TE>   Three other men were wounded by the gunmen, who were riding in a
white vehicle, police said. One unidentified victim who survived was
shot a few blocks away as he rode a bicycle, Lemos said.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour later, a 20-year-old reputed gang member, Ruben
Atilano, was fatally shot while warming up his car in front of his
home in the 500 block of Brittania Street in Boyle Heights, said LAPD
Det. Scott Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the gunman apparently shot him and then ran away.</TE>
<TE>   In Carson, sheriff's deputies responding to a report of gunshots
about 8:20 p.m. found the body of a 47-year-old man behind Notrica's
Supermarket in the 20200 block of South Avalon Boulevard. The Compton
man, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, had
been shot several times, police said.</TE>
<TE>   About two hours later, separate drive-by shootings claimed the
lives of two young men, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Leo B. Payne III, 25, was shot while in the parking lot of a
7-Eleven in Inglewood, at Centinela and Eucalyptus avenues, said
Inglewood Police Sgt. John Knapp.</TE>
<TE>   Payne, whose relatives said was on his way home from work, was
"quiet, meek, just as polite and humble as anyone you want to meet,"
said his aunt, Sabreen Abdulrahman.</TE>
<TE>   Payne had recently moved to Inglewood from Alaska, where he worked
on a fishing boat, because he wanted to be near his family after
Abdulrahman's son was killed in September, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdulrahman recalled a phone conversation she had with Payne after
her son's death. "He just talked about him and my son, and how close
they were when they were young," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said another man, whose name was not released, was wounded
by the gunfire at the 7-Eleven parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   In another shooting, in South Los Angeles, Javier Ibarra, 18, was
killed while crossing the street in the 1700 block of West 96th
Street. Police said they had no motive for the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Another shooting early Tuesday morning just west of downtown left
a man dead, and another man wounded.</TE>
<TE>   In what police described as a "running gun battle that went on for
several blocks," two armed men followed two men on foot beginning at
Olympic Boulevard and Hoover Street about 3 a.m., and then continued
their chase in a car, said LAPD Det. John Motto.</TE>
<TE>   Police said one of the men being chased was wounded and the other
one escaped. A neighborhood dog was fatally shot, police said. But
the gunmen were believed to have fatally shot another man at Pico
Boulevard and Hoover Street, Motto said. "It was quite a complicated
mess this morning," Motto said.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later in Compton, sheriff's deputies found the body
of a middle-aged man on the sidewalk after responding to calls that
shots were fired in 500 block of Matthisen Street.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified victim was shot twice in the upper body, said
Deputy William Spear.</TE>
<TE>   Then in Southeast Los Angeles, a 25-year-old man was fatally shot
in the head about 9 a.m. while sitting in his blue, Chevy Caprice
classic in the 140 block of West 111th Place, police said.</TE>
<TE>   His name was withheld pending notification of his family.</TE>

<HD>Whispering Hills Draws an Outcry</HD>
<DH>Environment: Citizens group urges San Juan Capistrano
planners to reject the proposed development. Decision is deferred
until April 9.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Nielsen watched as the character of historic San Juan Capistrano
changed before his eyes. He saw chain restaurants, plans for big
freeway interchanges and one planned community after another.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, when he heard about Whispering Hills--a 356-home tract
planned in the foothills that rise on the east side of town--he
decided he had seen enough. Nielsen and others formed Citizens
Against Uncontrolled San Juan Expansion, advocates for stopping or
slowing growth in the canyons and hills near town.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday night, the citizens' group took its fight against
Whispering Hills to City Hall, urging planning commissioners to
reject both versions of the plans that have been submitted.
Commissioners took no action but set a vote on the issue for April 9.</LD>
<TE>   One development scenario calls for a 356-home community off Ortega
Highway. A second calls much a smaller tract--no more than 193
homes--and a new high school.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen's group thinks the developer, Dennis Gage of Whispering
Hills LLC, is using the promise of a new high school--the city has
gone without one for decades--as a "lever" to get the controversial
housing project approved.</TE>
<TE>   "People say you can't be against the development without being
against the high school," said Nielsen, a software executive who has
lived in San Juan for 13 years. "That's not true. I don't know of
anyone who's anti-high school. But do we teach our kids that the ends
justify the means or do we look at it holistically?"</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schwartze, a consultant on the Whispering Hills project, said
the environmental group has been "shameless" in its attempts to block
development.  He denied that the school was added just to sweeten the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're home builders, the school came to us," Schwartze said
"We're trying to accommodate them."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, Nielsen urged city officials to consider a
scaled-down version--103 homes and a high school--that would spare
one of the two canyons that would be impacted by Whispering Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Doomey, associate superintendent with Capistrano Unified
School District, said as long as the plan includes a high school,
he'll be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "By 2005, San Juan Capistrano will have 1,600 kids that need to be
served," Doomey said. "This school is the linchpin of our strategy to
ease overcrowding in our schools."</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen contends that the Whispering Hills project would have been
doomed without the high school as an incentive to win city approval.</TE>
<TE>   In its response last month to environmental documents prepared for
both versions of Whispering Hills, the environmental group said the
development would worsen traffic, destroy pristine back country and
endanger wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "The intensity of this development impacts our quality of life and
the character of San Juan," Nielsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartze said the fact that Nielsen's group is offering an
alternative development scheme undermines their very argument.</TE>
<TE>   "They say 'You're going to destroy the biology, the geology' and
then they say if you can reduce units, that's all fine,'" Schwartze
said. "It's just a shameless approach."</TE>
<TE>   Once everyone has a say, Doomey believes all sides will be happy
with the end result.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous opportunity for all parties to be successful
here," Doomey said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll have a well-thought-out plan that ends with a new
high school."</TE>

<HD>Dentist Won't Be Retried on Final 3 Counts</HD>
<DH>Courts: After acquittal on 60 charges related to alleged
over-sedation of patients, prosecutors will ask judge to dismiss the
counts on which a jury deadlocked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office will not retry a
Pasadena pediatric dentist after a jury acquitted her last week of 60
of 63 criminal charges related to allegations that she over-sedated
her patients.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors on Tuesday said that they will ask Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito to dismiss the three charges--one of
conspiracy and two of child endangerment--on which jurors declared
themselves hopelessly deadlocked.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement brought to an end a criminal investigation
against Drueciel Ford, 50, that lasted more than two years and
involved more than 30 children, including a 15-year-old girl who
suffered brain damage.</LD>
<TE>   During the four-month trial, prosecutors characterized Ford's
practice as a production line where the overuse of an oral sedative,
chloral hydrate, caused patients to leave in a rag-doll state and
caused Melissa McGrath to suffer brain damage after a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's attorneys, however, portrayed her as a caring dentist
victimized by a "medical misadventure" involving one patient and a
prosecutor who believed sleepy children amounted to child
endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors' announcement came on the heels of a news
conference by a group of prominent African Americans who urged Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley to drop the charges against Ford, a well-known
African American professional.</TE>
<TE>   They warned that doing anything else would be perceived as
prejudicial treatment of a "person of color." If prosecutors decided
to try her again, some said, they would seek a federal probe.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said the news conference was unnecessary because
the decision to drop the charges was made at the district attorney's
executive staff meeting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On March 5, jurors found Ford not guilty of 60 criminal charges,
which ranged from criminal endangerment to allowing assistants to
practice dentistry without a license. They deadlocked on the
conspiracy count and one endangerment count, with 10 favoring
acquittal. They also deadlocked on another endangerment charge, with
11 voting to acquit.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's attorney, Robert H. McNeill, said he was delighted to hear
Cooley had taken "the correct and appropriate action."</TE>
<TE>   "We regret that Dr. Ford had to go through all this suffering,
harassment and financial hardship that left her business closed since
February 2000, and forced her to spend untold thousands of dollars on
this case and getting her children back from foster care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford still faces two civil lawsuits and potential action by the
state Dental Board, which suspended her license pending the outcome
of the criminal case, McNeill said. Authorities also took away her
four children because of the child endangerment allegations, he said.
The children remain in foster care.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said he hoped that Cooley would keep a tight rein on his
prosecutors and not allow them to pursue cases without merit. Deputy
Dist. Atty. Albert MacKenzie, who prosecuted the case, told a
newspaper last week that he would recommend at a minimum retrying the
conspiracy count. That comment, McNeill said, prompted the news
conference outside the downtown criminal courts building Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the woman go back to her family; anything less than that is
malicious and a miscarriage of justice," said Danny Bakewell,
president of the Brotherhood Crusade and a defense witness at the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   After the announcement, Bakewell said, "We certainly do have a
responsive district attorney for the first time in a long time. This
is a man who is not afraid to step up and take the hard decisions."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday before the announcement, Ford said her
prayers go out to McGrath's family, and that she had faith in the
jury system.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said she has paid dearly with her children thrust into foster
care while the criminal case was ongoing. "I don't get to see them,"
she said. "My little boy, every time he sees a police car, he says,
'Mommy are they going to take you to jail?'"</TE>

<HD>Residents Battle to Preserve Former Market</HD>
<DH>Land use: Some want to save former supermarket building as
an important link to the community's past. Others say it is not
historic and fear scaring off drugstore developer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Betty Tyndall fondly remembers her afternoon strolls to the local
Shopping Bag market in Eagle Rock. With some of her six sons in tow,
she'd walk a few blocks along Colorado Boulevard to the store, which
even then, in the 1950s, had a small-town feel that was hard to find
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "That would be our afternoon walk--to the store," said Tyndall,
now a 75-year-old grandmother. "You knew everyone in the store--the
checkers, Sam, the store's manager. I remember Sam because he was
from my husband's hometown--New Castle, Pa."</LD>
<LD>   Tyndall, who moved to Eagle Rock as a new bride in 1948, said the
market's selection of fresh meat, poultry and produce made it the
place to buy groceries in the area.</LD>
<TE>   Like-minded residents and others who share Tyndall's memories want
to save the old store. They say the building, the onetime flagship of
38 markets that flourished under the Shopping Bag banner in the
Southland from the mid-1930s to 1961, is worth preserving.</TE>
<TE>   They have collected about 1,800 signatures in a bid to prevent its
demise.</TE>
<TE>   Walgreens, the Deerfield, Ill., company that operates more than
3,600 drugstores nationwide, wants to tear down the old building to
make way for a new 14,000-square-foot outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Zoning Plan Envisions Small-Town Atmosphere</TE>
<TE>   That has set off a sometimes prickly debate in Eagle Rock.</TE>
<TE>   On one side are leaders of a local residents group, the Eagle Rock
Assn., and others who argue that the old store, built in 1951, is an
important link to the community's past.</TE>
<TE>   They say its preservation would help foster the small-town
atmosphere of the northeast Los Angeles community--an atmosphere
envisioned in the specific zoning plan for the business district and
its premier intersection of Colorado and Eagle Rock boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be important to anyone else, but it's important to
us," said Joanne Turner, president of the residents association.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment isn't unanimous, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear that the residents association may scare off Walgreens
with its aggressive campaign for "adaptive reuse" of the Shopping Bag
building, which has been vacant since an automotive paint and body
shop moved out last year. Since then, the building has fallen into
disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   A Walgreens spokesman said the company has rejected the reuse idea
as unworkable. And some in Eagle Rock agree.</TE>
<TE>   George Shapiro, a chiropractor and president of the Eagle Rock
Chamber of Commerce, said, "We support preservation. But the thing
is, the chamber is pro-business. As long as Walgreens conforms to
legally conducting a [viable] business, we have to support them."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if it's Walgreens, whatever," said Ray Patel,
owner of a Colorado Boulevard motel a few blocks from the proposed
Walgreens site. "We just want positive growth in Eagle Rock."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the debate has gotten nasty. Two locals favoring
preservation of the old store were asked to leave a recent
chamber-sponsored farmers market because they were seen seeking
signatures in support of their position.</TE>
<TE>   The Walgreens project was initially approved by the Los Angeles
Planning Department, but the approval later was pulled back when it
was pointed out that the project didn't conform with the area's
specific plan.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the "big box" approach of a drugstore on a large parking
lot was out of step with the small-town, pedestrian-friendly features
of the specific plan. Also, two smaller storefront buildings included
in the project didn't comply with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the project's developer, FCD Realty &amp; Development
of Los Angeles, and city planners have been meeting to iron out the
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an embarrassed Councilman Nick Pacheco has had to face
angry constituents who were initially upset that they were unaware of
the project and later became more enraged when he decided to support
demolition of the old building.</TE>
<TE>   "From my viewpoint, [a new Walgreens] is really the best use for
that space for the community," Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   That has added some heat to a growing argument over what is
historic and what isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Eagle Rock Assn. and area preservationists argue
that the building is historic because its 1950s motif harks back to
earlier times when storefront businesses were the mainstays of Eagle
Rock's commercial district. The small-town ingredient is an important
feature of the area's specific plan.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Rock Residents Founded Supermarket</TE>
<TE>   They say it's important to note that the Shopping Bag chain was
established by two Eagle Rock residents, W.R. Hayden and W.D. Rorex.</TE>
<TE>   Also, members of the Eagle Rock Assn. say their organization was
established because of the preservation bent espoused by some of its
founders. In 1986, activist Kathleen Aberman climbed atop a treasured
old building on Colorado Boulevard and tried to prevent the brick
storefront from being demolished to make way for a mini-mall.</TE>
<TE>   She was promptly hauled off to jail, but her actions helped spark
the formation of the Eagle Rock Assn. and its commitment to
preserving what it thinks is significant to the community.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, didn't impress members of the Los Angeles Cultural
Affairs Commission, which is empowered to declare buildings, parks
and even trees as historic within the city. Last year, the panel
rejected an application supported by the Eagle Rock Assn. to extend
historic status to the Shopping Bag building.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Kay Beckham said the panel toured the
building, but was not impressed. "There was nothing historic in its
history," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That setback hasn't deterred preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Garsten, a local activist who was a leading proponent of
preserving the old Van de Kamp's bakery in nearby Glassell Park, said
the Cultural Affairs Commission isn't always right.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the bakery, he said, the commission erred when it
supported a proposal to demolish the bakery, with its
16th-century-style Dutch facade. The site was to be cleared for a
big-box home improvement store and a Burger King. But since the
commission had granted the building historic status years before, it
had to be consulted on the proposed demolition. It agreed to let the
building be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   After several hearings in 2000, the Planning Commission rejected
the demolition project. Los Angeles Community College District
officials, however, later got city approval to preserve the historic
facade as part of a plan to build a satellite campus for Los Angeles
City College.</TE>
<TE>   In the Van de Kamp dispute, the Cultural Affairs Commission "was
oblivious to the community's sentiments," Garsten said.</TE>
<TE>   Walgreens Willing to Be Flexible</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Walgreens said it is willing to preserve a historic
structure if it can also meet its obligations to its customers.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Walgreens last year agreed to preserve a landmark
Firestone store slated for demolition in Miami's Little Havana
district. Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the company agreed
to reuse the structure, built in 1929, because it was listed by the
Dade Heritage Trust as an endangered place.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the company agrees to preserve historic buildings if they
are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, Polzin said.
As is turns out, the Miami building wasn't listed in the registry,
Polzin said.</TE>
<TE>   In Eagle Rock, he said, Walgreens looked at using the old Shopping
Bag building but decided against it.</TE>
<TE>   "We determined that it wouldn't work," Polzin said, explaining,
for example, that the narrow alley next to the old building would
make deliveries difficult if not impossible. He also said the store
is too close to the street.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what it takes to have a successful business," Polzin
said. "In the last 10 years, we've opened 2,700 new locations. Only
two [both in California] have closed because of poor sales."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't stop the folks fighting the proposed demolition, such
as Tyndall, who said, "I can't see why they can't save it."</TE>

<HD>New Limits on Political Spending Proposed</HD>
<DH>Elections: City ethics panel seeks to restrict independent
efforts on behalf of candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid concerns over the influence of unregulated political spending,
the Los Angeles Ethics Commission on Tuesday advanced a package of
reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners targeted money spent on behalf of a city
candidate--but not in coordination with him or her--that now largely
elude rules limiting spending and contributions.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, those "independent expenditure campaigns" hit a record
$3.2 million, compared with $36.4 million spent by candidates and
regulated by contribution limits, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The aim of the whole package of reforms is to make sure
independent spending doesn't drown out the voices of those candidates
who agree to participate in the matching-funds program and who agree
to spending limits," commission President Miriam Krinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many cities, Los Angeles tries to control the effect of money
on elections by providing matching funds to candidates who agree to
limit spending. Participating candidates are limited to $330,000 in a
City Council race and agree to accept no contributions exceeding
$500. The spending caps for both candidates in a race are lifted if
independent expenditures exceeding proscribed limits are made on
behalf of a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics commissioners directed their staff Tuesday to draft the
following provisions:</TE>
<TE>   * Lift the spending limit only for candidates whose opponents
benefit from independent expenditures. Lifting the limits for both
candidates "really made a mockery of the rules," former Councilman
Mike Feuer told the commission.</TE>
<TE>   * Political parties and unions that spend more than $1,000
communicating with members in support of a candidate must report it
to the Ethics Commission within 24 hours. Now, no reporting is
required.</TE>
<TE>   * Public matching funds would be provided faster for those whose
opponents benefit from independent campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   * Unions and corporations would be prohibited from making
independent expenditures. Instead, they would be required to form a
political action committee.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission asked for more legal analysis on a proposal to
require elected officials to abstain from voting on issues involving
entities that helped them with independent expenditures. Assistant
City Atty. Tony Alperin told the panel the proposal is probably
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   To address the advantage wealthy candidates have in funding their
campaigns, the panel agreed to consider prohibiting candidates from
using contributions after election day to repay loans they made to
their campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "Imposing this restriction would eliminate the appearance of
corruption or any perception that newly elected officials would be
repaying themselves with funds from those that seek to influence
them," said Ian Filep, the commission's policy director.</TE>

<HD>Arrest Warrant Briefly Issued for Official in Juvenile Sex
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An arrest warrant was issued and later withdrawn Tuesday for a Los
Angeles deputy city attorney after he belatedly turned up in a
downtown courtroom on charges that he attempted to lure a boy over
the Internet to meet him for sex.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Tuesday that Richard Bruce Coplen, 49, could face
additional charges related to allegations that he had sex with a boy
last December.</LD>
<LD>   Coplen, a veteran of the city attorney's office, is charged with
attempted oral copulation of a minor and attempted sexual penetration
of a minor. On Tuesday his arraignment was postponed until April 30.</LD>
<TE>   After Coplen failed to show for his 8:30 a.m. arraignment, a Los
Angeles Superior Court judge issued a warrant for his arrest. The
judge withdrew the warrant when Coplen appeared later in the morning;
he is free on $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Coplen was arrested last week in Duarte as he was going to meet a
15-year-old boy he allegedly had sex with previously. Coplen did not
know that police detectives had assumed the boy's online identity.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives say Coplen had sex with the teenager in December after
sending him a message over the Web offering to pay him $150,000. That
alleged encounter took place at Coplen's Highland Park home after he
picked up the boy at a park, police said. Coplen paid the boy a much
smaller sum, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina Fleming said "evidentiary issues" led
to a decision not to file charges in that incident. But she said the
encounter is still being investigated, and charges could be filed in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   After Coplen's arrest, police served a search warrant on his home
and seized two computers.</TE>
<TE>   Coplen, who once headed the city attorney's gang unit and helped
create Los Angeles' smoking ordinance, has been put on paid
administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   Police have asked other potential victims to call Det. Dale
Barraclough at (213) 485-2883 during work hours or (213) 485-2504 in
the evenings and on weekends.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes the long arm of the law needs an attachment. The Laguna
News-Post reported that "a police officer used magnets to help a
person retrieve her keys from a drain gate in front of Banana
Republic."</LD>
<LD>   Where do Dionne Warwick's pronouncements go? Laura Moreno of
Tustin found a company that evidently collects premonitions (see
photo).</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Roof! Roof! "These dogs are professionals," Joel Davis observed of
one L.A. company's warning (see photo). "Don't let your pets try this
at home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A pooch under someone else's roof: Lee-Ann Christian was on her
way to work in L.A. when she saw a sign that said: "Wht. Pitt Bull
3/11 FOUND 3/11 Grn Eyes, Brn, Spot Ctr. Back, Friendly Male, Call
..."</TE>
<TE>   She drove a few more blocks and saw another sign that read: "Lost
Dog, 3-11-01 third and gardener [streets], white pitbull with lg
Brown spot on his back and a lot of little brown spots as well. Call
..."</TE>
<TE>   The match was made. I admire the courage of anyone who would take
in a wandering Pitt Bull or pitbull.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Which reminds me: Carl Green of Lomita sent along a label from a
lamb's wool squeak toy for dogs. It said: "This product is not
intended for consumption."</TE>
<TE>   Observed Green: "I'm afraid that very few dogs are literate enough
to read the warning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still another shaggy creature story: I've mentioned how viewers
find some TV news folks irritating for the most interesting reasons.</TE>
<TE>   One complained to the media Web site ronfineman.com about an
anchor who blinks her eyes "upwards of 30 to 45 times per minute." A
second viewer asserted that another newswoman's "right eye slams shut
during her broadcasts."</TE>
<TE>   And still another declared that sports anchor Bill Weir of KABC-TV
(Channel 7) "doesn't comb his hair, doesn't smile, and looks like he
hasn't slept in days."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Getting to the roots of the problem: I thought it only fair to
wake up Weir for a comment (see photo of him in his more well-groomed
period).</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to that cruel and slanderous comment, Victor, my toupee
craftsman, has not stopped weeping all morning," Weir replied. "He'll
have you know that he uses only the finest goat hair and spends hours
combing it out on a little Styrofoam head in my office.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's Dallas Raines' fault. He insists on rubbing balloons
on my scalp before each show in order to generate enough static
electricity to power the [station's] Live Doppler 7000."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nightmarish flashbacks: With baseball getting underway, I can't
help but remember a couple of years ago when the season was drawing
to an end and the Dodgers and Angels were foundering as usual.</TE>
<TE>   During a station promo, Weir said: "Dodgers and Angels highlights
at 11. Please watch anyway."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A colleague noticed a gentleman at the corner of 5th
and Figueroa streets holding a large yellow sign that read, "Homeless

<HD>Registrar Apologizes for Election Day Problems</HD>
<DH>Voting: County official takes responsibility for snafus at
polls but also cites budget constraints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Complicated voting rules, an unusually early primary and a rash of
last-minute cancellations by poll workers combined to make last
week's election one of the worst-run in Los Angeles County history,
the registrar-recorder told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of poll workers failed to show up, causing about 150 of
the county's 4,845 polling locations not to open on time for the
primary at 7 a.m. Half of them had not yet been set up by 8 a.m.,
Conny McCormack said.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like to begin today by offering all of you and the voters
of Los Angeles ... an apology," she said during her preliminary
report on the problems. "The registrar-recorder let you down. I take
full responsibility for this."</LD>
<TE>   But she also said the county has refused for years to increase her
department's budget to hire more permanent staff and allow increases
in poll worker pay--criteria recommended by a 16-month-old audit of
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about last Tuesday's election flooded county officials
even before the voting was over, and have been the source of
particular concern given the close outcomes in two city of Los
Angeles races: the 2nd City Council District election and the city's
police bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   In the council race, an updated vote tally released Tuesday showed
Wendy Greuel leading Tony Cardenas by 299 votes, with at least 705
provisional ballots left to be counted.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q, the police bond measure, was about 430 votes over
the two-thirds majority needed for passage, with potentially
thousands of provisional ballots outstanding. Steven Afriat, campaign
manager for the measure, predicted that it would pass based on his
estimate of about 5,000 ballots left to be counted.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's election problems, McCormack said, began with the
short period--just two months--available to readjust polling places
to account for changes caused by redistricting after the census. The
county also had to find polling sites to take the place of about 200
schools, which had housed polls for June elections but declined to do
so this month because school was in session or construction was
occurring on the campuses, she said.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said her staff, scurrying to find polling places, spent
less time on poll-worker recruitment and neglected to place customary
confirmation calls to workers to ensure that they were going to show
up.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, she said, 50 to 75 supervising poll workers--those who
set up the polls and supplies, collect the completed ballots and
deliver them at the end of the day--change their minds in the days
before the election. Her department routinely hires 200 backup
workers to fill in those gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, 236 supervising workers called to cancel, she said,
sending the department scrambling to fill the slots. Already
straining, the department was not prepared to deal with the absence
of dozens more poll workers who simply didn't show up last Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It ended up being a cycle of one thing behind another. This is a
management problem for which I am taking full responsibility," she
said. "There's no excuse for that. We should have recognized it
earlier ... [but] we got behind to the point where we could not catch
up."</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said many of the prospective workers changed their minds
after receiving training on the rules governing which voters got
which ballots. In this year's election, for the first time in
California, members of the established political parties could vote
only in their own party primaries, but voters who did not affiliate
with a party could cast ballots in any primary they chose.</TE>
<TE>   "When they finished training classes, poll workers were very
scared about getting out the wrong ballot," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others contacted said they just forgot or got better job offers,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a deluge of calls to the registrar-recorder's
office on election day--from voters whose polling places were moved
and from workers complaining that supervising workers did not show up
with the ballots and polls. The department did not have a proper way
to deal with the calls either, McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the election, complaints have come in from across the county
about voting problems, and supervisors heard directly about more
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting, Montebello resident Anna Arriola complained
that voters in her area were particularly hampered, with many polling
places opening late and with not enough staff or supplies. Some did
not even have a register of voters to consult, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people signed on a piece of paper and were given ballots,"
she said. "If you just give a ballot to anyone who comes in, are
these ballots going to be counted?"</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors did not chastise McCormack, but rather confined
their comments to clarifying questions and suggestions about how the
department could find more poll workers, including tapping into AARP
and the ranks of county workers--even the supervisors' own staff.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack will report back to the board in three weeks with
recommendations on how to avoid the irregularities in the future.</TE>
<TE>   She said the county has denied her requests for additional workers
since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Her budget is slated to be cut by $3.8 million next year.</TE>

<HD>Woman Dies in Mobile Home Fire</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 39-year-old Santa Paula woman died early Tuesday after fire
engulfed her mobile home.</LD>
<LD>   Rhonda Gayle Yount was found inside the home on Ferris Drive near
Telegraph Road after the fire was put out about 6:15 a.m., said Sandi
Wells, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Yount's cat also died in the fire, which was ruled accidental.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have not determined the cause of the blaze, but said
Yount was a smoker. She died from inhaling smoke and carbon monoxide,
said Craig Stevens, senior deputy medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   Two mobile homes and one home that were fewer than 10 feet from
Yount's residence escaped damage and no other injuries were reported.
The blaze caused about $9,000 in property damage, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just incredible that they are so close, but the firefighters
were able to keep [the fire] contained to just this one," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Yount's neighbors, who declined to give his name, said he
smelled smoke as he was getting ready for work before 6 a.m. When he
went outside, he could see fire through the front windows of the
mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   He said he forced the door open and saw Yount in the corner of the
bathroom, but the flames made it impossible to reach her.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just too hot," he said. "The whole thing was engulfed."</TE>
<TE>   He placed a wooden ladder against one of the windows, but Yount
would not climb down it, the neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   Two passers-by also urged her to grab the ladder, and one of them
punched his hand through a window.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she was too scared," the neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor, who has lived next door to Yount for about three
years, described her as a kind woman who loved taking care of her
cat. She is survived by a brother in Fillmore, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Yount was the third person to die in a structure fire in Ventura
County since January 2001, when a 77-year-old woman was killed in a
blaze in her mobile home in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   In December, an elderly woman suffered burns in a house fire in
Simi Valley and later died from the injuries.</TE>

<HD>Students Have a Field Day at Farm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was career day Tuesday at Faulkner Farm near Santa Paula, and the
lessons centered on the importance of Ventura County agriculture and
the job opportunities available within the county's oldest and most
prominent industry.</LD>
<LD>   But leave it to the bugs to steal the show.</LD>
<LD>   While nearly 100 high school students learned much about the
plight and promise of agriculture, they reveled in details of a
clandestine war waged by farmers in which beneficial insects are set
loose to search out and destroy crop-munching pests.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to make the connection anyway possible," said Bruce
Freeman, education program coordinator for the UC Hansen Trust. "We
want to do whatever we can to show these kids what agriculture is all
about."</TE>
<TE>   The visit was co-sponsored by the trust and the Ventura County
superintendent of schools.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of the superintendent's Future Connections program,
launched last school year to expose high school students to career
opportunities in everything from health and human services to
hospitality and tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The career exploration program in agriculture was the fourth
Future Connections session held since September. Students were bused
to the 27-acre farm from high schools in Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo
and Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to show these students the breadth and depth of
agriculture--it's more than just the rows of crops they see every
day," said John Tarkany of the superintendent of schools office. "And
we wanted to show students [interested in farm-related careers] how
to get from here to there."</TE>
<TE>   It is the kind of program especially important to the people who
oversee the Hansen Trust, established by Thelma Hansen in 1992 to
ensure that farming in Ventura County would continue to hold its own
against suburban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   The trust, administered by the University of California's
agriculture division, is being used to create a learning center at
the century-old Faulkner Farm aimed at teaching the public,
especially young people, the significance of agriculture and its
value to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, farmers, entomologists and other
agriculture-related professionals were recruited to share their
stories Tuesday, telling of careers in everything from plant science
to pest detection.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-generation farmer Edgar Terry, president of the Ventura
County Farm Bureau, said he was pleased to see so much interest in
the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed that anyone in high school was interested in working
in agriculture anymore," Terry told the youngsters during the morning
session. "It's really gratifying."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there are students such as Brian Watson, 16, a junior
enrolled in the agriculture program at Camarillo High School, who
hopes to train as a crop-duster.</TE>
<TE>   And classmate Emily Padgett, 17, who wants to pursue a career in
veterinary medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are students such as Ventura High School sophomore
Mercedes Gonzalez, 16, who is enrolled in her school's floral design
class but is unsure whether agriculture is in her future.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to learn more about plants, and the hands-on stuff was
really fun," she said, emerging from a session in which she learned
about the delicate ecosystem present in a patch of beans, in the
shadow of the stately 18-room Queen Anne Victorian mansion that
dominates the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I like being outdoors," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I would really like living here."</TE>

<HD>Tolerance Is Stressed, Educators Insist</HD>
<DH>Schools: In the wake of three students' alleged involvement
in a hate crime, officials defend their teaching methods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach school officials bristled Tuesday at suggestions
they were not doing enough to prevent students from committing hate
crimes, a charge that came after three teenagers were accused of
beating a Filipino American man.</LD>
<LD>   The Ocean View School District, whose schools the youths
reportedly attended, offers programs on an almost daily basis that
teach tolerance and respect for diversity, said Supt. James R.
Tarwater.</LD>
<LD>   "We work on cultural diversity from kindergarten all the way
through," he said.</LD>
<TE>   But even with programs such as character education and Project
Wisdom, which includes weekly readings and daily quotes about
diversity and tolerance, "we always have some that we can't reach for
various reasons," Tarwater said. "And when you're offering some
counseling ... you can't force a parent to get involved with that if
they don't want to."</TE>
<TE>   The three youths arrested Saturday allegedly confronted Aris
Gaddvang in the rear parking lot of a 99 Cents Only store in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gaddvang, the store manager, was unloading merchandise when the
boys allegedly shouted racial slurs and "White power" before beating
him with metal pipes.</TE>
<TE>   The three were arrested nearby and taken to Orange County Juvenile
Hall on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon, criminal
threats and interfering with an individual's civil rights. Because
they are juveniles, officials would not release information on
whether they have been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Two Local Officials Respond to Incident</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook and Rusty Kennedy,
director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, responded
to the incident, saying schools could do a better job of teaching
respect for diversity.</TE>
<TE>   But Tarwater and the principal of a middle school in the district
challenged that assertion. They said district students have daily
instruction and guidance in tolerance and respect for others.</TE>
<TE>   They added that whenever a student or group of students is
involved in incidents that suggest prejudice, the district and school
react swiftly with discipline, counseling and intervention efforts
that include the parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't ignore it, and we're disappointed any time students
we've worked with in the past take a wrong turn. But given what I've
done, I can't beat myself up for a kid who goes the wrong way," said
Cameron Malotte, principal of Spring View Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "The overwhelming majority of our kids are wonderful, productive,
responsible citizens, and when you have some kids who do something
wrong and then people focus on the schools, I just don't think it's
fair," Malotte said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarwater said the youths are no longer enrolled in the district.</TE>

<HD>County Ordinance Makes It Illegal to Watch Street Races</HD>
<DH>Crime: Even observing preparations for racing is banned by
new law. Twelve have died in past year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS HABERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With deaths from illegal drag racing mounting, the Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday made it a misdemeanor to even watch
preparations for the street races in unincorporated Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, which was approved unanimously and takes effect in
30 days, spectators may be fined as much as $500 and sentenced to as
long as six months in jail.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance was modeled on similar bans passed in Los Angeles
and Ontario a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have connected the deaths of at least 12 people to
hot-rodding in the county over the past year. In 1999, eight young
people died in accidents linked to drag racing or intentional
speeding in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys alone.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, 17-year-old Korra Colnot of San Dimas died in a street
race in Ontario. In September, a 17-year-old Riverside youth was
killed and five young men were injured in a single-car crash during a
race near Ontario International Airport, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Ontario passed an ordinance allowing police to
ticket and even arrest spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the new laws fear that they will only push illegal
street racers and their fans elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, support for such laws is spreading. Agreeing to a
recommendation from Ontario Police Chief Lloyd Scharf, state Sen.
Nell Soto (D-Pomona) has introduced a bill that would make it a
misdemeanor statewide to attend an illegal race.</TE>
<TE>   Under SB 2087, anyone within 150 feet of an illegal race or 150
feet of preparations for it may face up to 90 days in jail and a $500
fine.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, however, are taking a hard look at San Diego, which
under a state-funded program called RaceLegal.com hosts drag racing
on two parallel eighth-mile tracks in the parking lot of Qualcomm
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   But Jack Dolan, director of RaceLegal, said he believes
anti-spectator laws work.</TE>
<TE>   "The big adventure in street racing is showing off in front of
your friends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it helps to have legal racing venues as an alternative to
street racing, Dolan said. And, he added, officials have to realize
that nothing will work to thwart hard-core street racers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A large percentage of the draw and the fun is getting chased by
the cops. We can't stop street racing any more than a stop sign stops
a car."</TE>

<HD>Officer Who Spoke Ill of Perez Is Censured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire
Division was reprimanded Tuesday for questioning the credibility of
disgraced former Officer Rafael Perez during a misconduct hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Joe Curreri received an official reprimand but no suspension
for making what was found to be an inappropriate comment during a
June 2000 Board of Rights hearing in which Perez was a witness.</LD>
<LD>   At that hearing about another officer's alleged misconduct,
Curreri, who was acting as a judge, said about Perez: "I would not
believe him if he said all this happened or none of it happened." In
that hearing, the accused officer was found not guilty despite
testimony against him from Perez.</LD>
<TE>   Perez was a central figure in the Rampart police corruption
scandal, and he provided information against fellow officers in
return for a lighter sentence for stealing drugs from evidence
lockers.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Rights hearing Tuesday, which included two LAPD
captains and a civilian, found that Curreri's comments were
"prejudicial."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good day for the public and the LAPD," Deputy City
Atty. Ted Smith said. "This is not about Curreri and his character.
But this ensures Board of Rights hearings from now on will be fair
and impartial."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the LAPD was also pleased with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to send a message that the Board of Rights process
applies to every employee regardless of rank," LAPD spokesman Lt.
Horace Frank said. "It must be fair and objective."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing Tuesday was packed with supporters for Curreri who
were deeply disappointed with the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't believe what Joe said amounted to misconduct," said
LAPD Capt. Dick Bonneau of the Southeast Division.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks signed the complaint against Curreri
in 2000. Curreri--who had an unblemished record in 27 years with the
LAPD--appealed, and the decision on his suspension was delayed until
his public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Several supporters said Curreri's statements about Perez expressed
what many among the department brass had already said.</TE>
<TE>   "Curreri was questioning the credibility of Perez's testimony
without corroboration, something everyone from the chief of police to
the district attorney's office has done," LAPD Capt. Jim Tatreau
said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks himself has had difficulty vouching for Perez as a witness.
In 2000, after three Rampart officers' criminal convictions were
overturned by a judge, the chief suggested that testimony by Perez
required corroboration.</TE>
<TE>   "We've said all along that Perez has to be corroborated by
physical evidence," Parks said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Lt. Don Mulrenin, who represented Curreri before the panel,
was unhappy with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that someone makes a comment on a Board of
Rights and he gets punished for it," Mulrenin said.</TE>

<HD>Living-Wage Proposal Is Rejected 5-2 in Ventura</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Ventura has turned down a living-wage proposal that would
have required companies doing business with the city to pay their
employees at least $9 an hour.</LD>
<LD>   After impassioned presentations from living-wage advocates, the
City Council on Monday night turned down the proposed ordinance on a
5-2 vote. Councilmen Brian Brennan and Carl Morehouse supported the
measure.</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind living-wage laws is to reduce poverty by mandating
pay for government workers and contractors that is higher than the
state minimum wage. Ventura County approved a living-wage law last
year.</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura council, however, balked at passing the cost on to the
city's residents. According to one city estimate, the city would
spend $400,000 to $800,000 to meet the ordinance's requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "Why enact an ordinance that artificially inflates the cost of
services to our residents?" asked Councilman Jim Friedman.</TE>
<TE>   All of Ventura's 645 full-time employees make more than the
living-wage already, according to city officials. Part-timers do not
necessarily make that much, but Friedman doubted that the measure
would help them. "They work an average of 350 hours a year," he said.
"An extra dollar or two an hour wouldn't change their lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   The living wage would be $9 an hour with health insurance benefits
and $11.25 an hour without them.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents contended the proposal made both moral and economic
sense, saying increased wages would reduce the likelihood that
workers on the brink of poverty would end up applying for welfare
benefits.</TE>

<HD>Remembrance of Teacher Takes Root</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Orange school plants a tree in memory of Jaris
'Bebe' Parker, who was revered by parents, students.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Four dozen kindergartners wearing blue headbands with paper ducks
stapled on them sang Tuesday in Orange for their teacher who died
unexpectedly last month.</LD>
<LD>   The students wore the headbands at a memorial service in which
they sang "The Little White Duck," a favorite of Jaris "Bebe" Parker,
a beloved veteran kindergarten teacher who died Feb. 17 after working
at Esplanade Elementary School 11 years. About 500 people--students,
teachers and parents--attended the event.</LD>
<LD>   Parker, who spoke six languages, including Spanish, made the
largely Spanish-speaking student body feel at home in her class,
parents and teachers said.</LD>
<TE>   She was remembered as an energetic teacher who not only taught but
also developed curriculum and prepared children for the challenges of
their first year at the elementary school. She became a teacher after
stints as an executive secretary, a seamstress and a graduate
student.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, administrators and students helped plant a magnolia tree
at the school Tuesday morning as part of the memorial. The tree was
donated by the Orange Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "As we watch this beautiful magnolia grow, we will be reminded of
the beauty she saw in each one of you," Principal Bertie Anderson
told the students.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, 46, collapsed while gardening at her North Tustin Hills
home Feb. 17. She is survived by her husband, Mitchell, and three
children, Rachel, 19; Leah, 17; and Stephen, 13.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel and Leah played a piano duet, "On Eagle's Wings," during
the ceremony. Parker's children and widower alternately clapped,
laughed and held back tears as they heard praise for the fallen
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very religious. She thought God had put her here to do
this job," said Mitchell Parker, who owns a Costa Mesa company that
builds sailboats. "She was the most satisfied person I know,
career-wise. She never thought of leaving this job."</TE>
<TE>   Parker recently began work on her national certification, the
highest honor for a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Parents asked the school to organize the memorial because "they
just loved her," Anderson said. In addition, parents organized a Mass
at La Purisima Catholic Church in Orange on Feb. 24 attended by about
350 people.</TE>
<TE>   About three dozen mothers with toddlers in tow were in the
audience Tuesday, even though they understood little of the
English-language ceremony. About 88% of Esplanade's 525 students are
Latino, and 65% are learning English. Only six of 24 teachers speak
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Parents said they felt at ease talking to Parker about their
children's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Ariceli Flores, a mother of four, said it wasn't just Parker's
knowledge of Spanish that was important: "I just felt comfortable
talking with her. She made us feel at home at our school."</TE>

<HD>Perrodin Urges Probe of Garbage Contract</HD>
<DH>Compton: Mayor alleges that the winning firm gave trips to
two council members. The $7-million deal was approved during his
predecessor's term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ripping his predecessor's administration as fraught with corruption
and nepotism, Compton Mayor Eric Perrodin on Tuesday called for an
investigation into a $7-million trash contract approved under former
Mayor Omar Bradley.</LD>
<LD>   "It's terrible here," Perrodin said at a news conference in a
mayor's office that has changed hands three times in eight months.</LD>
<LD>   After comparing Compton to Chicago, a city notorious for political
corruption, Perrodin said he believed that law enforcement had turned
a blind eye to wrongdoing by Compton's elected officials because it
did not wish to create the impression of persecuting a "majority
black" city.</LD>
<TE>   "If this stuff was going on in a city that's Caucasian, there
would have been a lot of indictments already," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 2000 census, Compton's population is 53% to 57%
Latino and the black population is 40% to 41%.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin spoke to reporters minutes before leaving for a City
Council meeting. He said he was making the comments because he has
gotten no help from council members who support Bradley. "The only
thing I can do is let the citizens know what's going on," he said
before airing numerous complaints and accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley was said to be meeting with attorneys and was unavailable
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The trash deal smells," Perrodin said, deriding the City
Council's January 2001 approval of a 15-year, no-bid contract to Hub
City Disposal, a company run by Michael V. Aloyan. Aloyan testified
in 1996 that he gave bribes to two former City Council members who
were later convicted of extortion and sent to federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin said Aloyan sent Bradley and former Councilwoman Marcine
Shaw and their families on trips to China and Africa. He did not
provide documentation Tuesday to back the allegations. "[Bradley's]
brother chairs the company's board of directors, and Shaw's son sits
on the board. It seems like a quid pro quo," Perrodin said.</TE>
<TE>   Aloyan hung up on a reporter when asked during a phone
conversation whether he paid for trips by Bradley and Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin also criticized the council's approval of a claim by
Bradley that would pay him $840,000 in legal fees and $43,000 in back
pay. The council, still controlled by Bradley supporters, approved
the claim the same day Perrodin was reinstalled.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley incurred the fees during his legal challenge to the June
election that unseated him. Bradley returned to office briefly last
month after a judge ruled in his favor, but the state's 2nd District
Court of Appeal reinstated Perrodin, pending the outcome of his
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin, a deputy district attorney, criticized the hiring
practices of Bradley's administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen so many ex-convicts," he said, adding that he
dislikes coming to City Hall because "I could be walking down a
corridor and end up with a knife in my back."</TE>
<TE>   He also questioned what he said were excessive payments to Frank
Wheaton, a city spokesman during Bradley's two terms who was rehired
during Bradley's brief return to office.</TE>
<TE>   Wheaton, whose salary is $75,000, said that any payments by the
city above that amount were for services "above and beyond the call
of duty," and were approved by the council.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to defend my work," Wheaton said.</TE>

<HD>Palmdale Man Is Held in Stabbing</HD>
<DH>Crime: He allegedly inflicted 50 wounds with a box cutter
on his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ex-boyfriend of a Palmdale woman was arrested on suspicion of
assault Tuesday for allegedly stabbing her current boyfriend 50 times
with a box cutter, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Odean Taylor, 31, of Palmdale was booked on assault charges in the
attack, which occurred in the 4100 block of East Avenue R, said
Deputy David Miklos of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in
Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   A neighbor called the Sheriff's Department just before 6 a.m. to
report a fight, but when deputies arrived a few minutes later, no one
was home, Miklos said.</LD>
<TE>   Then the station received a call from Antelope Valley Hospital in
Lancaster, informing authorities that Nikolas Nerves, 50, of Los
Angeles was being treated for 50 stab wounds inflicted by a box
cutter.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves, who was taken to the hospital by his girlfriend, had 35
wounds on his back and the rest on his face, upper torso and arms,
Miklos said.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, sheriff's deputies received a call from
Taylor, who said Nerves had stabbed him in the arm.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon, authorities pieced together how the three calls
may have been connected. They believe that Taylor went that morning
to the house of his ex-girlfriend, whom deputies did not identify,
and instigated a fight with Nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "The old boyfriend comes over to visit the girl," Miklos said. "I
think he started getting hostile toward her. The new boyfriend
intervenes. The next thing you know, out comes the box cutter."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies arrested Taylor at his home. He was treated for minor
injuries at the hospital and then booked into custody, Miklos said.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves was treated at the hospital and released.</TE>

<HD>Plan Now to Slow Sprawl, Panels Told</HD>
<DH>Growth: Residents urge county leaders during a three-hour
hearing to make the tough decisions that will preserve the area's
semirural feel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of Ventura County residents pleaded with the Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday to avoid the path to urbanization taken by
other counties by making tough planning decisions now.</LD>
<LD>   That means changing the way the county draws up its long-term
blueprint for growth, speaker after speaker told supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Tough decisions on when roads will be widened, whether more mass
transit should be encouraged and how many more housing units will be
planned should all be decided by the county and its 10 cities,
residents said.</LD>
<TE>   "It is time for all of us to find our vision for Ventura County
and to make decisions that depart from the past," said Curtis Stiles,
a Ventura landscape architect.</TE>
<TE>   The three-hour hearing came during a workshop held by supervisors
and the Ventura County Planning Commission to hear public views on a
proposed update of the county's General Plan, a document that will
guide county growth over the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   General plans typically are updated every 10 years, but Ventura
County's has not changed in 14.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors ordered a review last year but directed the staff to
focus mainly on traffic and noise.</TE>
<TE>   But during the hearing, several speakers urged supervisors to
expand the review to include how growth decisions will affect air
quality, agricultural resources, wildlife and even scenic vistas.</TE>
<TE>   One concern is whether the county plan should call for the
widening of some roads from two lanes to four or find other ways to
deal with transportation problems brought on by population growth.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett said it may be possible to absorb
population increases and sustain the county's semirural feel--but
only if some tough choices are made.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the board could insist that all road-widening
proposals first be approved by supervisors, Bennett said, or
encourage more mass transit.</TE>
<TE>   But the important step is deciding that the county wants to try a
different way, the Ventura supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   County voters took the first steps toward controlling growth when
they approved the SOAR laws in 1998, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite being next to one of the biggest metropolises in the
world, we want to stay semirural," said Bennett, a coauthor of the
SOAR initiatives. "My bias is to work every option before expanding
our roads."</TE>
<TE>   Several farmers also spoke, urging supervisors to consider changes
needed to keep the county's agricultural industry economically
healthy.</TE>
<TE>   One way would be to change a county regulation that limits
construction of work buildings to 5% of their farmland.</TE>
<TE>   With changing consumer demands, many farmers need more processing
plants and other buildings, farmers said. Supervisors should change
the limit to 10%, several speakers said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels said she supported the farmers' views.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want agriculture, which we do, we've got to be flexible
enough to let the industry remain viable," Mikels said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed to delay any decisions until the Planning
Commission has a chance to hold its own meeting on the issue. County
staff will also report back on how much a more comprehensive review
would cost and how long it would take.</TE>
<TE>   A delay makes sense if, in the end, the General Plan reflects the
collective view of residents and county decision makers, said board
Chairman John Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can do this in an isolated way," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 10 cities. We have water districts. We have school
districts. And everyone is in a controversy."</TE>

<DH>Education: A school's science teachers plan to reintroduce
dissection of fetal pigs and cats, but some students say it's useless
and inhumane to animals.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a decade of limiting dissections in science classes
to cow eyes, chicken wings and other parts that could be bought at a
grocery store, the tony Brentwood School is bringing back the
practice whole hog.</LD>
<LD>   Make that, more precisely, whole fetal pig. And whole cat.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to boost interest in medical careers, the school has
decided to encourage science students to dissect fetal pigs and cats
so that they can gain what Brentwood science teachers view as vital
hands-on experience.</LD>
<TE>   Though dissection fell out of favor for a time, it is making a
comeback in public and private schools and is widely practiced. But
at Brentwood, the decision to resume whole-animal dissection has
angered some students, who call it cruel and unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of animals a year are killed for this purpose," said
Andrew Oberstein, 14, a ninth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Given the array of software programs that can teach about animal
innards without requiring students to wield scalpels, Oberstein said,
"keeping dissection is like being stuck in the Middle Ages."</TE>
<TE>   Since fall, Oberstein and a classmate, Lindsay Weber, have waged
an impassioned campaign to get Brentwood's new head of school,
Michael D. Pratt, to rethink his decree. They recently organized a
"teach-in" at the private New Roads School in Santa Monica to discuss
the issue and rally support for their cause.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Pratt has listened politely to the students' concerns but
has refused to budge. Dissections have not yet resumed, but teachers
said they could begin any time.</TE>
<TE>   "This has historically been an important issue for the school,"
Pratt said in an interview at Brentwood, a campus with 673 students
in seventh through 12th grades. A recent alumni survey, he said,
indicated that a high percentage of former students viewed the
absence of dissection as a deficiency in their preparation for
college.</TE>
<TE>   When Pratt took over last summer as head of school, science
teachers began lobbying to reinstate the practice his predecessor,
Hunter Temple, had banned about 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a historian, Pratt said he dissected just one organism
in his life--an earthworm--in 10th-grade biology. He described
himself as an animal lover who regularly gives his dachshund the run
of his office.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no personal stake in the issue," Pratt said. Generally,
Pratt said, academic departments within schools should make decisions
about curricula. He intervened on this issue, he said, because of the
ethical dimension.</TE>
<TE>   He said he dutifully read arguments on both sides and listened to
faculty and students in private and school meetings. His decision, he
said, was "based on the gestalt of the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Teri Redman, who teaches ninth-grade biology, said she has tried
for years to instruct students about dissection using software
simulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the same at all," she said. One program, Operation Frog,
showed an animated heart beating. "It was all really neat," she said,
"but just a completely different experience."</TE>
<TE>   Questioned in their classroom, Redman's students were divided in
their opinions. One opponent said her father, a neurologist, told her
that practicing dissection didn't particularly influence his decision
to become a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Others said dissection would be a good learning experience as long
as they could be certain the animals had not been abused.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming we enter college, we don't want to be at a disadvantage
with our peers," said student Teddy Kim. "In a general sense, all
people should agree the human race is superior to all other forms of
life." Dissection can be used, he added, "to promote the health and
well-being of the human race."</TE>
<TE>   Cay Enns, a Brentwood graduate who teaches science and philosophy
at the school, said she is excited about the shift.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love cutting into a sheep's brain," she said. In its
basic structure, a sheep's brain is almost "identical to a human
brain."</TE>
<TE>   "When I dissected, it made me want to be a surgeon," she added.
"It's a tactile thing. You can't replace it."</TE>
<TE>   The Brentwood science department has assured students that it will
buy only animals or animal parts that are byproducts of the meat
industry or euthanized by the Humane Society. All purchases will be
made from supply houses supervised by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. Fetal pigs will be used in ninth-grade biology, with
cats reserved for advanced science classes.</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey by the Brentwood teachers found that most other
independent schools in the area encourage whole-animal dissection. A
few schools steer clear, however.</TE>
<TE>   At Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, the
science department head uses only animal parts in his anatomy and
physiology classes. And he gets grief even for that from an animal
rights club on campus. He said he sees the students' point.</TE>
<TE>   "Biology is the study of life," teacher Michael Sommers said.
"It's kind of incongruous to say, 'Let's kill this and dissect it.'"</TE>
<TE>   California's education code, which governs public schools, states
that any pupils who have a moral objection to dissection may choose
not to participate without fear of having their grades suffer, said
Phil Lafontaine, a consultant with the California Department of
Education.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mantra is that the kid has the right [to opt out] and the
school district should have an alternative available, rather than
leave the teacher hanging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Grasso, the science department chairman at Brentwood, said no
student will be forced to dissect.</TE>
<TE>   Such assurances do not sway Oberstein and Weber. At the
teach-in--which attracted about 50 adults and students--Weber
recalled how her dream of becoming a doctor almost died when her
sixth-grade class dissected frogs. When the teacher went out for
coffee, she said, pupils began slashing off frog limbs and throwing
them at one another.</TE>
<TE>   "The memory has haunted me ever since," she said. She still plans
to pursue a career in medicine, she said, adding: "I hope to be up
here talking about how I became a doctor without having to dissect."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry W. Vlasak, a trauma surgeon and advisor to the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine, a health advocacy organization,
said he went through college and medical school without dissecting
any animals.</TE>
<TE>   "No surgeon in this country learns how to be a surgeon by
dissecting animals," he told the teach-in participants. "We learn
everything we need on humans."</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case in such highly charged debates, few people
changed their views about dissection at the teach-in.</TE>
<TE>   But it pleased Oberstein that Redman, his teacher, was so
impressed by some of the 3-D software that she plans to set up a
demonstration for Brentwood's science faculty. Oberstein hopes that
software programs could enable the school to use fewer animals.</TE>

<HD>2nd Suit Filed Over Air From S.F.Bay Area Smog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For the second time in a month, the state Air Resources Board has
been sued by a Central Valley air quality district over pollution
blown in on winds from the San Francisco Bay Area.</LD>
<LD>   The local air district for Sacramento County asks in its lawsuit
that the state air board push for tougher auto smog inspections in
the Bay Area.</LD>
<LD>   That suit, filed Monday in Sacramento Superior Court, follows a
virtually identical legal challenge launched Feb. 20 by the San
Joaquin Valley air district asking that Bay Area motorists
participate in the Smog Check II program.</LD>
<TE>   "The major point of our lawsuit is fairness and equity," said
Kerry Shearer, a spokesman for the Sacramento Metropolitan Air
Quality Management District.</TE>
<TE>   Though cars in Sacramento and the San Joaquin Valley have to pass
the tougher standards of Smog Check II, motorists in the Bay Area do
not. It is the only metropolitan area in the state that hasn't been
required to participate in the program.</TE>
<TE>   The result, according to Central Valley air regulators, is a huge
amount of bad air blown in on winds during the summer months, adding
to the pollution problems of a region facing harsh consequences from
federal regulators if it doesn't clean up its air by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   How much pollution is carried into the valley remains a question.
A study in the early 1990s found that a quarter of the pollution came
from the Bay Area, but state regulators say those conclusions
represented a brief, bad smog cycle unrepresentative of normal
events.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1 million cars in the Sacramento area, "there's
plenty of home-grown smog to put them over the health base
standards," said Gennet Paauwe, a California Air Resources Board
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento County, the big problem is ozone, an invisible
pollutant that can cause breathing difficulties and long-term health
effects. The area has reduced the number of bad air days in recent
years, but has a way to go to exceed federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in 1984, Sacramento had 23 days that exceeded federal
air quality standards. Last year, just three days violated the
limits, Shearer said.</TE>
<TE>   The region has until 2005 to meet the federal standard of no more
than one bad air day a year on average. If not, federal highway
funding could be jeopardized and tougher limits on business could be
enacted that could hinder economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators in the San Joaquin Valley face a similar deadline and
even tougher problems.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from ozone, the southern half of the Central Valley has
difficulties meeting air particulate standards because of diesel
fumes, dust kicked up by agriculture and other pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, air regulators say the valley's air is sullied not only
by pollution from the Bay Area, but also by bad air blowing in from
Sacramento to the north.</TE>
<TE>   A review last year by the state air board determined that
migrating pollution pouring into the northern San Joaquin Valley
represented an "overwhelming" factor on bad air days in Stockton,
Modesto and Merced.</TE>

<HD>Davis Names Feinstein's Billionaire Husband to the UC Board
of Regents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday named investment advisor Richard C. Blum,
a billionaire San Francisco investor married to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, as a member of the University of California Board of
Regents.</LD>
<LD>   Blum, 66, is chairman of Blum Capital Partners L.P., a member of
the advisory board of the business school at UC Berkeley, and a major
political donor to Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Blum and his companies have contributed more than $75,000 to Davis
over the past two years, including $15,000 in October.</LD>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Alex Traverso said neither Blum's political
donations nor his marriage to Feinstein would "have anything to do
with the job he is going to do as a regent."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a coveted appointment," Traverso said. "Richard is a good
appointment. His involvement at UC Berkeley and on the board of the
UC business school has been very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   But Republican political consultant Sean Walsh, who worked for
Davis' predecessor, Pete Wilson, said Blum's appointment, which
requires state Senate confirmation, "deserves a great deal of
scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   "Blum is a businessman used to making deals, and Gray Davis is a
governor who prides himself on pay-to-play government," he added. "I
would like to know what Dick Blum is getting from this deal."</TE>
<TE>   Blum's financial entanglements have at times proved nettlesome for
his wife. Critics have questioned whether his business portfolio
represents a conflict of interest for Feinstein. For example,
Feinstein is a vocal proponent of increased China trade, while Blum
has had extensive investments there. In 1997, Blum vowed to turn over
any profits from his China investments to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, there has been bad blood between Feinstein and
Davis, who compared her to wealthy tax evader Leona Helmsley in the
1992 U.S. Senate race--which Feinstein won.</TE>
<TE>   "I can easily imagine the young activists at UC Berkeley
demonstrating and staging sit-ins at regents meetings over Blum's
investments and relations with oppressive foreign governments," Walsh
said.</TE>

<HD>Experts Say Girl's Blood Found on Suspect's RV, Coat</HD>
<DH>Courts: Danielle van Dam's fingerprints were also
discovered, forensic specialists testify.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Danielle van Dam's blood was found on murder suspect David
Westerfield's jacket and recreational vehicle, and the 7-year-old's
fingerprints were found near the bed in that vehicle, police forensic
specialists testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Danielle van Dam
made those prints," fingerprint expert Jeffrey Graham testified as
Westerfield sat impassively in the courtroom of Superior Court Judge
H. Ronald Domnitz.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield is accused of kidnapping as well as murdering the
girl, whose family lives two doors from him. The child's body was
found Feb. 27 in a rural area, 25 days after she disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   The testimony came on the second day of a preliminary hearing to
determine whether there is enough evidence to try Westerfield for the
crimes. He is also charged with misdemeanor possession of child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Police testified that Westerfield's computer contained "highly
organized" files of pornographic pictures downloaded from Web sites,
including about 100 depicting young girls.</TE>
<TE>   A cartoon in one of the files showed a young girl begging not to
be raped, police Det. James Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Another file contained pictures of the bikini-clad teenage
daughter of Westerfield's girlfriend, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's name is Danielle, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said the pornography is significant
because it suggests a motive for the crime: that Westerfield, 50, a
self-employed engineer, had sexual fantasies about young girls.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Robert Boyce protested that police could not
prove that Westerfield downloaded the pictures, and suggested instead
that his 18-year-old son or someone else may have done so.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce, in cross-examining Watkins, said there also is no proof
that the females in the pictures are not 18 years old, which would
make the pornography protected under the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people look older than others at different ages, don't
they?" Boyce asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Some look younger too," Watkins responded.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives testified that Westerfield took his jacket and also
comforters and comforter covers from the recreational vehicle to a
dry-cleaning business two days after Danielle van Dam was discovered
missing from her home in the Sabre Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Police Det. James Hergenroeather said a clerk at the business told
him that Westerfield appeared upset as he brought the items in for
cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Annette Peer, the Police Department's DNA expert, testified that
the blood on the right shoulder of Westerfield's jacket and on the
carpet of the recreational vehicle was Danielle's.</TE>
<TE>   During a cross-examination by Westerfield's attorneys, the police
forensic specialists conceded it was not possible to determine when
the blood and fingerprints were left on the jacket and recreational
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said Westerfield told them Danielle and her mother,
Brenda, came to his home selling Girl Scout cookies in the days
before her Feb. 2 disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle and one of her brothers ran around his home without
supervision, Westerfield told Det. Johnny Keene, according to Keene's
testimony Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing is scheduled to resume Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Bill Designed to Force Draft Registration</HD>
<DH>Senate: The proposal would deny driver's licenses to
California's 18-year-old men who do not consent to Selective Service
sign-up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's draft-age men, among the nation's worst at registering
with the Selective Service, could be denied driver's licenses for
failing to sign up under a bill moving through the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Despite objections that it would quash dissent to the draft and
might be used to "flush out" illegal immigrants, the bill passed the
Senate Governmental Organization Committee on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The little-noticed bill would have the effect of automatically
registering California men ages 18 to 26 with the Selective Service
System when they are issued their first driver's license or state
identification card. Their names, addresses and Social Security
numbers would be forwarded electronically to a federal databank,
where they would be presumed to have registered. Those who fail to
give their consent would be denied driver's licenses.</LD>
<TE>   Driver's license applicants ages 15 to 17, too young to register,
would be presumed to have given their consent when they turn 18.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's sometimes emotional hearing, Sen. Mike Machado
(D-Linden), who served in the Vietnam War, denounced the bill as an
assault on the constitutional right of young men to dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Another lawmaker, Sen. Nell Soto (D-Pomona), suggested that the
bill actually was intended to "flush out" illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   But a third member, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), endorsed the plan
as a sensible and cost-efficient way to induce young men to register
for the Selective Service. The draft was abolished in 1973, but since
1980, federal law has required men ages 18 to 26 to register in case
the draft is reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   If they do not sign up, they can be prosecuted as felons, an
unlikely possibility these days. More likely sanctions include loss
of federal student loans, denial of federal job-training benefits and
loss of ability to work for the federal government or in some state
government jobs.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 46 nationally, California is among the worst states for
compliance, proponents of the bill said. Selective Service records
showed that at least 16,000 California men who had turned 27 had
failed to register with the draft during the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   The bill (SB1276) by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), a
sleeper that has stirred virtually no attention from defenders of
civil liberties, was narrowly approved by the 13-member committee on
a bipartisan 7-2 vote.</TE>
<TE>   It was sent to the Transportation Committee for another hearing.
If successful, it would be heard by the Appropriations Committee and
the full Senate. Its fate in the Senate is uncertain, but similar
legislation has perished in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "Registration is the law. I think it should be made simple and
seamless for our young men and not be punitive," Speier told the
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by the Selective Service System and supported by
veterans organizations, the bill was based on laws already in effect
in 15 other states with poor Selective Service compliance records.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all have improved significantly by linking registration
to approval of a driver's license, testified Justo Gonzalez Jr. of
Denver, western regional director of Selective Service.</TE>
<TE>   Speier and Selective Service officials testified that many
draft-age men fail to register because they are unaware of the
requirement and may, unknowingly, be subjecting themselves to severe
consequences, such as being rejected for a U.S. government job or
loss of student aid.</TE>
<TE>   They said the message isn't getting through to young men in
California through high school counseling and "reminders" that are
mailed to nonregistrants, whose names and addresses currently are
provided to the Selective Service System twice a year by the state
Department of Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Markarian, California director of the Selective Service
System, said he believes many young men ignore such warnings because
they are of a generation that does not want to accept "personal
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, he said, only 83% of eligible registrants born
in 1981 had signed up.</TE>
<TE>   But Machado, a Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, charged that
linking issuance of a driver's license to registration poured ice
water on a young man's right to choose to refuse to sign and face the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Young people have the right to make a choice," Machado said. He
asserted that "our Constitution allows for dissent and protest....
This bill fundamentally attacks the premise upon which this nation
was founded."</TE>
<TE>   Further, said Machado, who voted against it, the bill sought to
make the state instead of the U.S. government the enforcer of the
Selective Service law. "You are coming to the state when the federal
government doesn't enforce its own law," Machado told Markarian and
Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Speier rejected the notion that the bill was anti-immigrant. She
said it would apply to draft-age legal immigrants who had been in
this country for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also was opposed by the Friends Committee on Legislation,
which represents conscientious objectors and various faiths,
including Quakers, Mennonites and Jehovah's Witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   But Dunn defended the bill as a "simple, pragmatic way at the
least cost to the taxpayer to get young men registered for the
draft." Two other Democrats and four Republicans agreed and voted for
the bill.</TE>

<HD>Attorneys Seek to Block Book About Lindh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO --Lawyers for accused U.S. Taliban fighter John Walker
Lindh, who is facing trial on charges of conspiring to kill Americans
abroad, took action Tuesday to stop publication of an instant book
about his life.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco attorney George Harris wrote to University Press, a
small California publishing house, telling them that the forthcoming
book--thought to be the first about the 21-year-old captured in
Afghanistan--is "grossly and outrageously false and defamatory."</LD>
<LD>   The letter, a copy of which was forwarded to Reuters by the
publishers, warns that "publication would be at your peril."</LD>
<TE>   The book, called "John Walker Lindh; American Taliban," is due to
be published March 14 and is already listed on the Amazon.com Web
site and other online book stores.</TE>
<TE>   Rhawn Joseph, the owner of San Jose-based University Press, said
the book was written to answer the question millions of Americans
have been asking since Lindh's capture last November: how a boy from
middle-class Marin County ended up fighting for the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph said the book was based on investigative reporting in
California and other states but the two authors had not traveled
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going forward with publication," Joseph told Reuters,
adding that University Press had made "repeated attempts" to work
with the family and Lindh's lawyers.</TE>

<HD>Owner in Mauling Case Denies Dogs Were Aggressive</HD>
<DH>Courts:  Marjorie Knoller testifies that the animals' fatal
attack on neighbor Diane Whipple was unexpected, 'a totally bizarre
event.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco attorney on trial for murder in the dog mauling of
her neighbor denied Tuesday that her Presa Canario dogs were
aggressive, despite earlier testimony by nearly 30 witnesses that the
dogs had lunged at or charged others.</LD>
<LD>   Defendant Marjorie Knoller testified that she could not have known
her dogs would do something so "disgusting and gruesome" as attack
Diane Whipple.</LD>
<LD>   "How can you anticipate something like that?" she said. "It's a
totally bizarre event."</LD>
<TE>   During three hours of questioning, Assistant Dist. Atty. James
Hammer attacked Knoller's credibility, accusing her of changing her
story. He also questioned the sincerity of her tearful testimony
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you," Hammer asked, "expressed sorrow either to Diane
Whipple's mother or to her partner, Sharon Smith?"</TE>
<TE>   Knoller responded, "Personally, no."</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, a 33-year-old college lacrosse coach, died from loss of
blood and asphyxiation after the dogs attacked her in the hallway
outside her San Francisco apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, who lived two doors down from Whipple, was indicted
by a grand jury on charges of second-degree murder, involuntary
manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog. Her husband, Noel, 60,
faces the latter two charges.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, Bane and Hera, have been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have argued Knoller and Noel knew the dogs were
dangerous but did nothing to prevent an attack. Defense attorneys
maintain their clients were responsible dog owners, and that the
attack was unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer confronted Knoller with the testimony of witnesses who
described terrifying incidents with Bane and Hera.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, Knoller said the witnesses were not telling the
truth: That never happened. He was wrong. That is false. She even
said her husband was inaccurate when he wrote in a letter that the
dogs had pulled her down the hallway and forced her to let go of them
or risk losing her footing.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs never showed aggression before Jan. 26, except once when
Bane bit Noel's finger, Knoller said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just sweet, friendly dogs?" Hammer asked.</TE>
<TE>   "In my presence, yes," she responded.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller also testified that she was never warned about the dogs'
nature. She said their previous owner, who testified that Hera had
killed her farm animals, never told her that.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Hammer's questions about a veterinarian's letter
saying that the dogs would be a liability, Knoller said she believed
the dogs would be fine with the proper training and discipline.</TE>
<TE>   But she acknowledged that she recognized that anything was
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time you brought Bane and Hera into San Francisco, did you
have any doubt in your mind that large dogs could maul someone
terribly or kill them?" Hammer asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Any dog can do that," she answered.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer also challenged Knoller's assertion that she desperately
tried to protect Whipple from the dogs by throwing her body on top of
the victim. He questioned why she only had a few minor cuts "after 10
or 12 minutes of the vicious mauling of Diane Whipple," while the
victim was so badly bitten that her clothes were shredded.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to trying to shield Whipple, Knoller said, she put
pressure on Whipple's neck to slow the bleeding, she said. "There was
blood all over," she testified. "I knew that obviously it was a grave
injury."</TE>
<TE>   Knoller said she left a dying Whipple in the hallway while she put
the dogs in her apartment. Then she walked passed Whipple to look for
her keys.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer questioned Knoller about an earlier witness who connected
her to an attack dog breeding ring run from inside Pelican Bay State
Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller admitted that she adopted prison inmate Paul Schneider,
knowing he was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and had stabbed an
attorney. But she said she did not participate in the breeding ring,
even after Hammer confronted her with business fliers found in her
apartment.</TE>

<HD>UC Board Discusses SAT Fate</HD>
<DH>Regents: Concerns are raised about proposals to stop using
the test in admissions and to develop a new exam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Regents of the University of California launched their first formal
discussion Tuesday of a proposal that the university drop the SAT
test as an admissions requirement, and several immediately expressed
serious concerns.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than a year ago, UC President Richard C. Atkinson
shook the higher education community nationwide by challenging the
value of the venerable test and calling on the university to stop
requiring it for admission.</LD>
<LD>   In January, a key faculty committee agreed, recommending that the
university drop the SAT in favor of developing an exam more aligned
with high school coursework.</LD>
<TE>   The regents are not scheduled to vote on the faculty proposal
until July at the earliest, but Tuesday's half-day "informational"
session offered a glimpse into their thinking on the issue. Although
many expressed initial support, especially for the idea of linking an
admissions test to California's curriculum, others worried about the
cost and potential upheaval involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We are about to embark on a very disruptive, very costly and very
complex process, one in which we are not certain what the outcome
will be," said Regent George Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   He asked the university's administration and regents to consider
possible alternatives, such as continuing to use the SAT but
de-emphasizing it relative to other exams, including the SAT II
achievement tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Why put the system, the students and the state through this,
unless it can be clearly demonstrated" that the benefit is
worthwhile, Marcus asked.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson has argued that the SAT is unfair to many students and
fails to measure how much they learned in high school. Instead,
he--and the influential faculty committee governing admissions--have
said that they want a "core" achievement test closely aligned with
California state standards for elementary and high school education.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Atkinson said a new test would not necessarily involve
starting from scratch but could combine elements of various
admissions exams now used at UC and other colleges, including the
ACT, the SAT and the SAT II. Any new test is likely to take effect no
earlier than for the class entering the university in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Marcus, other regents expressed concerns about the
proposed test, including whether, as suggested, it could be
formulated in such a way that a score equivalent to either the SAT or
ACT could be derived from it. That would be important for California
students applying to colleges elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But several voiced support.</TE>

<HD>State Is Taking Advantage of Ghost Jobs on Payroll, Audit
Finds</HD>
<DH>Finances: Agencies shuttle workers among vacancies to keep
unused salaries for other purposes, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State agencies are exploiting loopholes to keep so-called ghost
employees on the government payroll and are spending the unused
salaries, a new audit suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Republican lawmakers said Tuesday that the report by the Bureau of
State Audits vindicates their contention that "phantom jobs" continue
to haunt state payrolls. For several years, GOP lawmakers have been
pushing for such jobs to be eliminated and for hundreds of millions
of dollars in unspent salaries to be redirected to the general fund.</LD>
<LD>   In one finding of the state audit, a review of five large agencies
in the 2000-01 fiscal year, vacancies beyond normal attrition totaled
2,400 jobs with combined salaries of $116 million.</LD>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said he
may sponsor legislation to ensure that state agencies receive salary
money, even for budgeted positions, only when the positions are
filled.</TE>
<TE>   "It conforms with what we've been saying, that the Davis
administration was playing a shell game with vacant positions to
create a bureaucratic slush fund," Brulte said. "Frankly, I find it
offensive."</TE>
<TE>   Finance Director Tim Gage said the Davis administration has
eliminated 6,600 vacant positions and cut 5% from agencies' salary
allocations to account for unfilled jobs. Most of the unspent money
is used for overtime or temporary workers to staff the unfilled
spots, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is overtime for the correctional officers who supervise our
prisons, and for contract nurses who provide health care to children
and services to the mentally ill," Gage said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The audit said that existing laws fail to address the reasons that
certain positions remain empty for long periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the audit said, unspent salaries are used for
authorized purposes that have not been fully funded, including
covering salaries for hard-to-fill jobs and giving overtime and merit
pay to some employees.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of keeping phantom employees dates to the recession
of the early 1990s, when agency officials began using unspent
salaries to help balance their diminished budgets.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, lawmakers made it tougher for agency officials to avoid
eliminating positions as they empty, but departments have continued
to circumvent the law and preserve the vacant slots, according to the
audit.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of 50 large state departments found that agencies held
open vacant slots by moving employees among positions to make them
appear filled. The number of employee transfers rose 53% the year
after the Legislature cut the amount of time a position could remain
vacant before being abolished, from nine months to six.</TE>
<TE>   An audit of five specific departments found that the Department of
Industrial Relations, for example, moved one employee 10 times within
16 months to save six empty positions from elimination.</TE>
<TE>   The same study found that at least 89% of the transactions from
July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2001, were performed to save vacant
positions, according to the audit. Not only did staff acknowledge in
many cases that they were shifting employees among positions to
preserve vacant slots, but they also acknowledged spending
significant time and resources on the task.</TE>
<TE>   The Employment Development Department reported spending 1,840
hours--the equivalent of one employee--during the last fiscal year to
monitor and preserve empty positions.</TE>
<TE>   State Auditor Elaine M. Howle recommended that the Department of
Finance issue an explicit policy prohibiting agencies from shifting
employees among positions to preserve vacant slots and also directing
agencies to track and annually report the uses of unspent salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Finance officials have yet to establish an ongoing monitoring
program, the audit concluded, nor does a method exist to provide the
Legislature with an up-to-date, reliable count of vacancies.</TE>

<LD>A Rancho Cucamonga couple were ordered Tuesday to stand trial for
failing to get medical attention that could have saved the life of
their 11-month-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Richard and Agnes Wiebe were charged with involuntary manslaughter
after their daughter, Julia, died of meningitis in July. The couple
told authorities their religious beliefs prevented them from using
modern medicine and that they instead relied on prayer. They also
said they did not realize the seriousness of the child's illness.</LD>
<LD>   Both appeared in a Rancho Cucamonga courtroom Tuesday for the
conclusion of a preliminary hearing in the case.</LD>
<TE>   During the hearing, which lasted several days, a forensic examiner
said the baby suffered through high fevers, vomiting and seizures for
three days before dying on July 6. Antibiotics would have probably
cured Julia Wiebe, the examiner said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the hearing, members of the couple's Upland church, the
Church of God Restoration, filled the courtroom in a sign of support.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ordered the Wiebes to return to court March 19 to enter a
plea. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges at an earlier court date
and have remained free on bail.</TE>

<HD>Board Votes to Complete Belmont</HD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education resurrected the Belmont Learning
Complex on Tuesday, deciding to complete the half-built high school near
downtown that it had abandoned two years ago over fears of toxic gases
beneath the site.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted 6 to 1 to begin negotiations with a coalition of
Latino education advocates seeking to solve the environmental problems
and open the campus within three years to about 4,600 students.</LD>
<LD>   The new school, located atop an old oil field visible from the Harbor
Freeway, will get about 2,500 downtown area students off buses and allow
the existing nearby Belmont High to remain a separate high school.</LD>
<TE>   "In delivering this project correctly and safely, we'll heal some
things in this community that need healing," said Los Angeles schools
Supt. Roy Romer, architect of the revival.</TE>
<TE>   The school board must still approve a contract within three months
with the Alliance for a Better Community, the group chosen over one other
bidder. The district will seek a cap on costs and more details about the
complicated system of gas venting and polyethylene soil liners the plan
proposes to ease health worries.</TE>
<TE>   The campus already has cost $154 million and another $20 million in
litigation and other fees. Finishing the job will run as much as $87
million from bond proceeds and revenues that the district receives from
new construction throughout its territory, officials said. Privately,
school board members acknowledge that the final additional tab could
exceed $120 million, easily making Belmont the most expensive public high
school in California history.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing the Belmont campus has symbolic importance for a school
district trying hard to rehabilitate its image from a bungling
bureaucracy to one deserving public trust. Tuesday's vote comes as L.A.
Unified prepares to ask voters to approve in November more than $1
billion in bonds to build 85 additional schools in the sprawling
district.</TE>
<TE>   School board members cast their votes in an overflowing boardroom at
Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters after a speechmaking
marathon that featured a parade of Belmont supporters and a few
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Belmont students, parents and elected officials, including Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn, urged the board to finish the project that has
slogged through a decade of scandals, litigation and political upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a high school in this area without delay," Hahn told the
board, adding that he has had concerns about environmental and legal
issues surrounding the project. "We need to build a school that not only
meets expectations but exceeds expectations. We're going to be watched on
this."</TE>
<TE>   The school board abandoned Belmont in January 2000 amid concerns about
the extent of methane and hydrogen sulfide vapors in the ground of the
34-acre campus. It then sat idle, a prominent eyesore partly swathed in
plastic, as other downtown landmarks, such as the Disney Concert Hall and
Our Lady of the Angels Roman Catholic Cathedral, progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young and board members Jose Huizar, Mike
Lansing, Marlene Canter, David Tokofsky and Genethia Hayes voted to
complete Belmont. Julie Korenstein voted no, citing concerns about
whether the environmental mitigation can work.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein cautioned Romer not to "skimp on any environmental
mitigation."</TE>
<TE>   "Please be very cautious, very careful," she said. "I continue to have
very, very serious reservations about the project."</TE>
<TE>   Young, who voted to stop the project two years ago, said she changed
her mind because the district has assembled capable managers to oversee
it and relied on noted outside experts for advice on financing, insurance
and environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel confident that . . . we will be able to build a school that is
safe and that will be safe in the future," Young said. "That is a very
big change from two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   School board members clearly were nervous about the decision, which
caught them between their growing Latino constituency pushing for the
school and continuing worries about funding and students' health. They
approved a flurry of last-minute amendments to cap the price in
negotiations with Alliance for a Better Community and its partner, Matt
Construction, to create independent oversight of the design, construction
and operation of the school, and to require further analysis of the risk
of litigation and hazards.</TE>
<TE>   A few critics at the meeting questioned whether the gases would seep
up and around the proposed soil liners. Others expressed concerns that
the gas venting system could become clogged with soil and other debris.
But organized opposition to the plan softened in the last year when such
highly visible critics as state Sen. Tom Hayden and Assemblyman Scott
Wildman left office.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming sentiment in the board room was that building Belmont
is necessary--and possible.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Maria Rodriguez, who attended Belmont's groundbreaking ceremony
in 1997 and still has her hard hat and shovel from it, was elated. "It's
about time," she said after the vote. Rodriguez had expected her daughter
to attend the new Belmont, but the junior will have graduated by the time
the campus opens. Even so, the mother is happy for the families who will
benefit. "We've waited long enough," she said. "I knew it was going to be
completed, so I never got rid of [the hat and shovel]."</TE>
<TE>   About 100 current Belmont parents and students marched a mile from the
existing school to the meeting and milled in the halls, awaiting the
vote. "I'm very happy because we accomplished what many of us have been
working for for a long time," said parent Mirna Velasquez. "This is a
victory for our community."</TE>
<TE>   Belmont also is a success for Latino grass-roots organizations that
saw the school as a test of the district's respect.</TE>
<TE>   Romer led the charge on Belmont, pulling together experts to review
three bids that were submitted by private development teams, including
Alliance for a Better Community. One was disqualified and the remaining
one claimed it lost because of the winner's political muscle. The
alliance is headed by Ed Avila, former chief of the Los Angeles Community
Redevelopment Agency. It includes the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund and the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials insisted that the alliance was the most
qualified bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Huizar, the board's vice president, lobbied members of the Los Angeles
City Council, who unanimously approved a motion last week urging
completion of the school. Huizar co-wrote the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a victory for a community populated by mostly immigrants,"
he said. "Many came here for their children's education and if we are not
providing that, we are not fulfilling our obligation."</TE>

<HD>Assaults in a Cloak of Faith</HD>
<DH>* Fake spiritual healers in immigrant communities prey on women and
girls in hundreds of sexual attacks, police say.</DH>

<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esmeralda was curious about the man who was known for his ability
to see into the future.</LD>
<LD>   She was 15 when she went to visit him at his house in southwest Los
Angeles. She says the first thing he asked was whether she was a virgin.
Her answer was yes.</LD>
<LD>   He then told her about the terrible vision he had involving her
father: He was a victim of witchcraft and would die soon.</LD>
<TE>   Esmeralda says the man made her believe her father could be saved if
she sacrificed her virginity to St. Martin Caballero, the patron saint
used in luck charms. The saint, the man said, would be embodied in him.</TE>
<TE>   Now Esmeralda is among seven women and girls who claim they trusted
Carlos Hugo Catalan, 51, as a faith healer, but instead were sexually
assaulted by him.</TE>
<TE>   Catalan late last month pleaded no contest to five counts of unlawful
sexual intercourse by fraud or fear and two counts of sexual intercourse
with a minor. He was sentenced to 10 years in state prison and ordered to
register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say a case like Catalan's, in which so many of the victims
make public accusations, is extremely unusual. Police and prosecutors
believe hundreds of women and girls are being sexually abused while
seeking religious healing in Los Angeles and elsewhere, though relatively
few cases make it to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, sex-related cases with ties to faith healing,
in which people believe a cure is accomplished through religious faith
and prayer, have been publicized in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, New
Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Wisconsin, as well as Canada and England.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a Houston man was sentenced to 20 years in prison for
convincing a 16-year-old girl to have sex with him to rid herself of a
curse. Last year, a man was convicted of sexually assaulting a Toronto
woman who believed bad spirits had poisoned her marriage. Also last year,
a New Jersey man was charged with raping a Maryland woman who turned to
him while seeking a cure for her leg pain. He allegedly told the woman
her family would die if she revealed they had sex.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Cardenas, also known as Oswaldo Cardonas, was sentenced to 108
years in prison for robbing, raping and sexually assaulting members of
four families in Compton while a faith healer more than 10 years ago. His
victims ranged in age from 9 to 65.</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors say the common denominator in the cases is a
faith healer who befriends women and then makes up frightening tales that
eventually lead to fraud and sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, police say abuse by faith healers is especially common
in neighborhoods with large numbers of new immigrants, many of them
Latinos who refer to healers as santeros or curanderos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a crime in which there are [many] more victims than are
reported," said LAPD Det. Karen Zuniga, who has investigated four cases
of rape involving faith healing during the last nine months in the
Rampart Division's eight square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Ysamur Flores Pena, a visiting professor at UCLA who teaches about
Santeria, a religion that worships West African deities along with
Catholic saints, said it is difficult for believers to verify the
integrity of those they turn to for healing.</TE>
<TE>   "They go to these city slickers thinking about the experience that
they have had in their home countries, which has nothing to do with sex
or any other deviance," Flores Pena said. "Then they submit themselves to
these treatments, thinking that they are the same as the ones from their
countries, and that's when the problems begin."</TE>
<TE>The Quest for Divine Intervention</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every religion has a tradition of seeking help from a divine
power to cure illness.</TE>
<TE>   In Christianity, the belief in faith healing stems from Jesus'
miraculous ability to cure the sick and even raise the dead. Individuals
in various Christian denominations have received attention over the years
for their apparent healing abilities. In ancient times, temples to the
Greek god of medicine, Asclepius, were often erected near natural springs
believed to have healing power.</TE>
<TE>   Police say some families who turn to faith healers are such firm
believers or are so desperate for a solution to their problems that they
are willing to spend hundreds, and even thousands, of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Areles Flores said her Botanica El Sol in Los Angeles has become a
refuge for women who have been abused by faith healers. She said most of
them are afraid to report fraud or sexual abuse. Some tell her they fear
they might fall victim to an evil spell. "I try to tell them that there
is no way that a spirit would do anything to hurt them," Flores said. "In
the end, I don't think that Satan could ever be more powerful than God."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. David Cedeno investigated the Cardenas and Catalan cases. He
said some faith healers build trust gradually and ultimately claim that
they have supernatural powers. He said people who went to Cardenas
believed he was omnipotent and could walk through walls.</TE>
<TE>   Abusive faith healers "condition their victims in a period of time,"
Cedeno said. "When they earn their trust they become more aggressive in
their requests, and that's when the sexual assault happens."</TE>
<TE>   Cedeno said the Los Angeles Police Department, which recorded more
than 1,200 rape cases in 2001, does not separate those allegedly
committed as part of religious rituals.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities said many victims are so convinced that
faith healers have supernatural powers that they do not resist sexual
contact. In some cases, their faith is so strong that they return even
after they begin questioning whether the contact is improper, authorities
said. "Everything is done in a way that is very smooth," Zuniga said.
"That's why they don't realize what happened until they come out and had
a couple of hours to think: 'My breasts have been groped and someone put
their hands down my pants.' After playing it back in their minds, they
realize they have been sexually assaulted."</TE>
<TE>Prosecution Can Be Difficult</TE>
<TE>   Even when victims muster the courage to file complaints, prosecution
can be difficult. Authorities must be able to explain in court how anyone
could be so naive that they can be convinced that a sexual act was
necessary in a religious or healing ceremony. Those familiar with faith
healers said sex has nothing to do with the traditional practices.</TE>
<TE>   Flores Pena has practiced Santeria for 20 years, and said that people
should be skeptical of any requests to disrobe.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have to take off any part of their clothes because the
cleansing does not require nudity," he said. "Sometimes I wonder, where
is the common sense of these people? But I think that their desperation
does not allow them to think sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said unscrupulous faith healers can easily identify
potential victims.</TE>
<TE>   "They profile these women, and if they seem vulnerable, they try to
prey on them," Zuniga said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Loftfield alleges that
profiling victims was one of Catalan's main skills.</TE>
<TE>   He was known to use Tarot cards to tell people about their future,
pray with those seeking help and pretend to undergo spiritual
transformations, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Catalan denied any wrongdoing for more than two years after his arrest
in January 2000. A trial in Los Angeles Superior Court last year ended in
a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   During that trial, Catalan's neighbor Margaret Carlos testified that
he helped her pray for her oldest son, Armando, who had joined a gang.</TE>
<TE>   When her other son, Alex, began hanging around with gang members,
Carlos testified, Catalan warned her that the teenager would be killed.
The only way to keep gang members from killing Alex was for Carlos to
have sex with Catalan after the spirit of St. Martin Caballero had taken
over his body, she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Loftfield said Catalan used the fears about Alex to encourage Carlos
to leave her two daughters, ages 16 and 10, at his house for prayers.
Catalan told the girls they could save their brother by making a sexual
sacrifice to the saint, Loftfield said.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyer Thomas Moore and Catalan's relatives said that
Catalan was a friend of the family who never abused anyone. In the end,
Catalan entered the plea because he faced up to life in prison if
convicted, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Catalan's daughter Leticia, 18, said she remains certain the
accusations are false.</TE>
<TE>   "My father is loving, very caring," Leticia Catalan said before the
plea. "He is everything you would want in a father."</TE>
<TE>   Esmeralda saw a different Catalan. During the trial, she testified
that Catalan said only he embodied St. Martin Caballero. She said Catalan
warned her that if she told anybody she was giving up her virginity to
the saint, her sacrifice would lose its value.</TE>
<TE>   "I would see my dad, and he was sick at that time. So I was, like,
maybe it's true, so maybe I do have to do that, even though I don't want
to," Esmeralda said. "If it was in my hands to save my dad, I was going
to do it."</TE>

<HD>'Chilling' Postscript to Saldivar Case Revealed</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Self-described "Angel of Death" Efren Saldivar gave a second "much
more chilling" confession to Glendale police last year, law enforcement
officials disclosed Tuesday after the former respiratory therapist
pleaded guilty to six murder counts under a plea bargain that will spare
him the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Saldivar, who initially confessed in 1998, reportedly said in the
second confession that he used paralyzing drugs to kill 60 hospital
patients by 1994 and "lost count" after that, though he kept killing for
at least three more years. He also was said to have compared killing to
shoplifting a piece of gum, commenting that once you've done it "you
don't think about it for the rest of the day, or ever."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance Ito scheduled sentencing for
April 17, when the former Tujunga resident will receive six terms of life
in prison without parole for his killing spree at Glendale Adventist
Medical Center.   During the 20-minute plea proceedings Tuesday, Saldivar
also waived his right to appeal his conviction or sentence.</LD>
<TE>   "You will spend the rest of your life in prison and you will
eventually die in prison," Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert MacKenzie told
Saldivar, 32, who bowed his head and said "guilty" to the six murder
counts and another for attempted murder in a barely audible voice.</TE>
<TE>   After the plea, Saldivar's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Verah
Bradford, said that he had chosen to admit his guilt "not to avoid
punishment but rather to accept responsibility and importantly to bring
closure to the family members of the decedents and, of course, finally
now, in his mind, make peace with God."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said his office decided
not to fight for a death sentence in order to avert a costly trial,
including "protracted litigation" over testing procedures used to detect
the muscle relaxer Pavulon in the exhumed bodies of the elderly patients
who died in 1996 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley and other officials on the case said they do not expect to ever
know Saldivar's full death toll.</TE>
<TE>   In his unexpected 1998 confession, Saldivar estimated that he had
given "40-something" lethal injections during his nine years as a
graveyard shift respiratory therapist. He quickly recanted the
confession, however, and maintained for three years that he had
fabricated the stories of killing patients because he was depressed and
wanted to die himself.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Cooley and Glendale Police Chief Russell Siverling
revealed that Saldivar had confessed once again on Jan. 9, 2001, after he
was arrested on his way to a construction job in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Siverling said the respiratory therapist was far more callous than in
his first confession, in which he insisted that he killed patients to end
their suffering. The second time, Saldivar said that simple "laziness"
motivated some of his killing, along with annoyance at "patients [who]
were crying out in some loud fashion, or noisy," the police chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't believe is that the title 'Angel of Death' is
appropriate," Siverling added. "He was not that kind of mercy killer.
These patients did not ask to be killed and their families did not ask
that they be killed."</TE>
<TE>   But Saldivar provided no patient names or other details that would
have enabled the prosecution team to pursue additional counts or
accurately calculate the number of victims, MacKenzie said at the
post-plea news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Saldivar has told so many different stories. 'I killed people.'
'I didn't kill people.' I don't think we'll ever know," the prosecutor
said.</TE>
<TE>   By entering guilty pleas, MacKenzie added, "I think he expressed
remorse today."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors agreed to drop one secondary
count charging Saldivar with illegal possession of a sedative, Versed,
found during a search of his home.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said the decision not to seek the death penalty was based in
part on "the uncertainties of proffering new scientific protocols,"
specifically the testing system developed by Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory to search for Pavulon and other drugs in tissue taken from
bodies that had been buried for several years. He also cited the risks of
relying on Saldivar's "ambiguous self-serving admissions."</TE>
<TE>   Even without the death penalty, he said, Saldivar's sentence "will
serve as a deterrent to others who might harbor the misguided belief that
such conduct in a hospital setting is either ethical or legal."</TE>
<TE>   None of the families of Saldivar's victims attended the downtown Los
Angeles court hearing Tuesday. But several relatives told the Times that
they approved of the plea agreement, even though it precludes the
possibility that Saldivar would be sent to the state's death chamber,
where he would have been injected with the same drug, Pavulon, that he
used on his victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid since he recanted his [1998] confession that somehow he
might get a sentence where he could be out on the street again in a few
years or maybe he'd get an insanity plea or something," said Vickie
Lowery, the great-niece of Myrtle Brower, 84, who died at Glendale
Adventist on Aug. 2, 1997. "My fear was he'd just do this again. I'm
pro-death [penalty], so my feelings are he should be put to sleep. But
this is the next best thing. "Now I know Myrtle's been taken care of,"
said Lowery, 53, of Van Nuys. "Maybe now I can put all the boxes of files
and records away. I kept everything of hers because I didn't know what
the police might want from me in court. I can kind of let go of it all
and get on with my life."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Schlegel, whose 77-year-old mother, Eleanora, died on Jan. 2,
1997, said he was relieved not to have to testify at a trial.</TE>
<TE>   "If he pleads out, that certainly saves us all of the frustrations of
some other trials," Schlegel said. "That would be a better outcome than
some other trials here. With a trial, it's going to get more emotional. I
don't mind being spared that."</TE>
<TE>   Hearing that Saldivar had now admitted killing Schlegel's mother was
so disturbing, he said, "I almost think it would have been best never to
have known anything."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar also pleaded guilty to killing Salbi Asatryan, 75; Jose
Alfaro, 82; Luina Schidlowski, 87; and Balbino Castro, 87, between
December 1996 and August 1997. He also admitted injecting a potentially
lethal drug into the intravenous line of Jean Coyle, now 64, who was
revived and lives in a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Adventist Medical Center released a statement Tuesday
offering prayers "for all who have been affected by these circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   "We are relieved that this four-year search for the truth seems to be
at an end," the statement said. "For the hospital, as well as the
families, these past four years have been painful."</TE>
<TE>   Had the case gone to trial, the defense was expected to challenge the
validity of Saldivar's statements and the lab findings, while emphasizing
how little direct evidence linked him to the specific victims. According
to court records, no hospital employee saw him inject any of them. In
only one case was there a witness, a nurse, who placed Saldivarin a
victim's room shortly before death.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans of hospital "Angel of Death" investigations elsewhere say
that such facts make these cases among the most difficult serial murders
to prove. In contrast to shootings where it is obvious that the victim
did not die of natural causes, there often is little reason to be
suspicious of the death of sick, elderly hospital patients. What evidence
there is often gets buried with the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Glendale police task force have acknowledged that there
was a lot of guesswork involved when they picked 20 bodies to exhume from
among the more than 1,000 patients who died while Saldivar was on duty.</TE>
<TE>   And Chief Siverling said his detectives may never have been able to
make a case had Saldivar not used Pavulon and only injected another
paralyzing drug, succinylcholine chloride, which degrades more rapidly in
body tissue. Co-workers said they noticed vials of that drug in
Saldivar's locker, but lab tests failed to find any in exhumed bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "To find the truth is difficult in a case of this complexity,"
Siverling said.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the police task force, Sgt. John McKillop, has said that
Saldivar "may have done hundreds" of killings, which would place him high
on any list of serial killers--lists already replete with hospital
poisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In such cases, there often is a gap between the murders proved in
court and totals suggested by provocative confessions or statistical
studies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987 and 1988, nursing aide Donald Harvey pleaded guilty to 37
murders in Ohio and Kentucky, but confessed to poisoning 58 people over a
16-year period while holding various hospital jobs.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Dr. Michael Swango pleaded guilty to three killings on
Long Island and one in Ohio, and was believed by the FBI to have taken up
to 60 lives on two continents.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago in Great Britain, Dr. Harold Shipman, a small-town
physician known for visiting elderly patients in their homes, was
convicted of injecting 15 women with fatal doses of heroin.</TE>
<TE>   A later study concluded that he had 297 more patient deaths than
similar practices over a 24-year period. McKillop said he and his
detectives would have tied more killings to Saldivar if funds had been
unlimited. The biggest frustration was leaving so many families uncertain
whether their loved ones had died naturally, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate goal would be to just keep working it until you have all
the answers. But you are doing a murder investigation and you've got to
balance the desire to have all the answers with realistic goals,"
McKillop said.</TE>
<TE>   The realistic goal had been achieved with Tuesday's murder conviction,
he said, but "there are victims that are unspoken for."</TE>

<TE>SALDIVAR CASE TIMETABLE</TE>
<TE>   Feb 16, 1998 Glendale Adventist Medical Center receives a phone tip
that an unnamed respiratory care therapist "helped a patient die fast."
Hospital officials determine that the tipster is referring to Efren
Saldivar, who had been investigated internally a year earlier after a
coworker reported rumors he had a "magic syringe."</TE>
<TE>   March 2 Glendale police asked to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   March 11 Saldivar voluntarily comes to police headquarters to answer
questions and winds up confessing that he killed "40-something" patients
by injecting paralyzing muscle relaxers into their intravenous lines.
Saldivar, then 28, is arrested on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   March 13 Saldivar is released after a prosecutor says authorities need
independent evidence to corroborate his confession.</TE>
<TE>   March 30 Glendale police disclose that they have formed a task force
to investigate deaths at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   April 9-10 Saldivar appears on two television newsmagizines and
declares, "I lied." He says he concocted his "Angel of Death" story
because he was pressured by police and was so depressed he wanted to die.</TE>
<TE>   April 28, 1999 Police announce that after an exhaustive review of
hospital records, they are ready to exhume 20 bodies of former Glendale
Adventist patients.</TE>
<TE>   May 19, 2000 With the investigation past the two-year mark, an
attorney for Saldivar asks a Superior Court judge to compel police to
release their evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 9, 2001 Saldivar is rearrested while driving to a construction
job in the San Fernando Valley and ordered held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 10 Authorities reveal that tests conducted at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory found Pavulon in tissue from at least six bodies,
providing the basis for six murder counts that could result in the former
respiratory therapist receiving the death penalty. Saldivar also is
charged with possession of a sedative, Versed, found in his home.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 2 Saldivar pleads not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 17 A Los Angeles County grand jury indicts him on the six murder
counts, one for possession of the Versed and a new count of attempted
murder, for allegedly injecting a patient who survived.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 5 Saldivar, now 32, again pleads not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   March 12 Saldivar pleads guilty before Judge Lance Ito to the six
murder counts and one attempted murder count under a plea bargain sparing
him the death penalty. He agrees to a sentence of life in prison without
parole.</TE>

<HD>Jury Rejects Insanity Claim, Convicts Mother of Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: Andrea Yates could face death for drowning her five children
in Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>A jury took less than four hours Tuesday to find housewife Andrea
Pia Yates guilty of capital murder for drowning her children in the
family bathtub on a sunny summer morning.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old mother, who said she was insane at the time, could be
executed for systematically putting her five children to death in a tub
of water. A second round of testimony is to begin Thursday to decide
Yates' punishment.</LD>
<LD>   After a stunningly fast review of weeks of complex psychiatric
testimony, the panel of four men and eight women rejected Yates' insanity
claims. From the time Judge Belinda Hill uttered the first "guilty," the
hushed rows of witnesses, family members and friends sat motionless with
shock. Even when court was dismissed and the audience filed out, somber
silence filled the room and the corridors beyond.</LD>
<TE>   Yates turned to look at her mother and brother, and choked back a sob.
She did not glance in the direction of her husband, who testified in her
defense. When the verdict was read, Russell "Rusty" Yates gasped and
dropped his head into his hands. He stayed hunched in his plastic chair,
stared at the floor between his knees and shook his head from side to
side.</TE>
<TE>   The jury spent Tuesday morning listening to angry prosecutors argue in
fiery inflections that Yates must be punished. She plotted the deaths
meticulously, carried them out mercilessly and showed clear signs of
understanding what she'd done, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "The children had become a hindrance, and she wanted them gone,"
prosecutor Kaylynn Williford said, pacing before the jury. "She made the
choice knowing it was a sin in the eyes of God and a crime in eyes of the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Yates waited until her husband left for work last June, then filled
the bathtub and drowned her children. Months later, she told a state
psychiatrist "it was a bad idea" and pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity. For years, the former nurse and high school valedictorian had
struggled through hospitalizations, suicide attempts and bouts of
depression. Her lawyers had hoped the Yates case would go down as a
landmark in women's mental health.</TE>
<TE>   But an insanity plea is difficult to pull off in Texas, where the
definition is narrow. Yates needed to convince the jury she couldn't tell
right from wrong when she killed the children--even though she told
detectives she understood what she'd done and deserved to be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the Texas definition of insanity," said Gerald
Treece, associate dean of South Texas College of Law, "is a person can be
totally psychotic and still in that world they know right from wrong."</TE>
<TE>   After deliberating for two hours, the Yates jury asked a single
question: What is the definition of insanity? Soon thereafter, they had a
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me we are still back in the days of the Salem witch
trials," said defense lawyer George Parnham, who listened to the verdict
with one arm wrapped around a slumped Yates. Her lawyers had called her a
loving but sick woman and implored the jury to spare Yates from execution
or prison.</TE>
<TE>   "If this woman doesn't meet the standard for insanity, nobody does,"
Parnham said in his subdued closing argument. "We might as well wipe it
off the books."</TE>
<TE>Yates Tried for Only 3 Killings</TE>
<TE>   Yates stood trial for just three of the killings, a decision that
leaves prosecutors the possibility of bringing her back to court in the
deaths of Paul, 3, and Luke, 2, if they think her punishment is too
light. She has been found guilty of murdering Noah, 7, and John, 5, and
in the drowning death she described as the easiest of the five,
6-month-old Mary. She was charged with one count of multiple murder and
one count of killing a child younger than 6. Both are capital crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ludicrous--this woman shouldn't even be standing trial," said
Cyndie Aquilina, a jury expert for the defense. "You can look at her eyes
in the mug shot. That woman was on another planet."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers described a woman who scratched "666"--the sign of
Satan--into her scalp and had hallucinations of cartoon characters
talking to her from the television screen. In her psychosis, they said,
Yates had come to believe that her children were tainted and bound to go
to hell if they grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "She was doing the only thing in the world she thought would save her
children from hellfire and damnation," defense lawyer Wendell Odom told
the jury.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors insisted Yates knew she had committed a terrible
crime. Worried about making a bloody mess, she had decided against
stabbing the children, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Yates held her flailing children underwater so firmly that John's dead
fist still clutched a clump of her hair, prosecutors reminded the jury.</TE>
<TE>Husband Depicted as Domineering</TE>
<TE>   Yates was a despondent wife who was domineered by a zealously
religious Rusty Yates, prosecutors argued. Andrea Yates was haunted by
guilt because she was too busy to care for her father, who died of
Alzheimer's a few months before the children's deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe she wanted to punish her husband for what she'd been through,"
Williford said. "Maybe she wanted to punish her children for taking her
away from her father. . . . She was overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday morning, as lawyers made their closing arguments, Rusty Yates
bounced his legs nervously. He shook his head and heaved sighs during
prosecutors' arguments, jotted notes on a tiny pad and muttered to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of factual errors," he said afterward. "Anyone who
has a mental illness and watched that would be offended."</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates wept quietly when Williford described the deep bruises on
the children's bodies from their struggle against their mother.</TE>
<TE>   Williford's characterization was relentless: Yates locked the back
door and hid the bodies of the first drowning victims lest their older
brothers have a chance to escape, she said. Yates later spread the bodies
over the bed she shared with her husband and phoned police. When the
first officer arrived, she answered the door and said, "I killed my
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have asked for the death penalty, but Yates can only be
sent to death row if the jury votes unanimously in favor of execution.</TE>
<TE>   When they decide, jurors will be asked whether Yates poses a
continuing threat to society and whether there are mitigating factors
against her execution.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just her children; they're not her possessions,"
prosecutor Joseph Owmby said. "They belong to us. This will stab your
heart every time you see a child laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Roger Clinton Said to Be Deeply Tied to Pardons</HD>
<DH>Politics: House reform panel says ex-president encouraged his
brother.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With President Clinton's encouragement, his half brother, Roger,
collected hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby on behalf of as many
as 13 people seeking presidential pardons and other favors, a key
congressional panel has found.</LD>
<LD>   This characterization goes far beyond what Roger Clinton has
acknowledged about his activities in seeking presidential pardons and
suggests that he was much more deeply involved than previously known.</LD>
<LD>   The new revelations about the Clinton brothers are contained in the
final report by the House Government Reform Committee, which for the last
year has been investigating the pardon scandals. The report was obtained
Tuesday by The Times.</LD>
<TE>   The probe concluded that the former president and his administration
repeatedly failed to properly check the backgrounds of people seeking
pardons and sentence commutations. It also said the Clinton White House
permitted a culture that provided easy opportunities for relatives and
close associates of the president to make money on the side by lobbying
for clemency and other presidential favors for convicted felons.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton team was besieged by requests for pardons and other
favors. Some of those requests bypassed the normal Justice Department
review system and instead went directly to the Oval Office, often at the
urging of those who had the president's ear.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Clinton made some very bad decisions when he gave away pardons,"
said one official close to the committee's investigation. "His
administration very seldom did real background checks on many of those
seeking pardon."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clinton could not be reached for comment. Bill Clinton has
denied that pardons were for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is expected to publicly release its report and vote on
the findings Thursday. It carries no legal weight.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee is headed by Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), a longtime
Clinton adversary. Clinton White House officials have decried the review
as nothing more than a partisan attempt to hound the Clinton
administration long after it has left the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's report also provides new details about the prison
commutation granted to convicted cocaine dealer Carlos Vignali of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators found that the president's brother-in-law
Hugh Rodham repeatedly misled the White House in seeking a commutation
for Vignali and suggested that former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
was also behind the commutation.</TE>
<TE>Rodham Misstated on Fee Return, Probe Finds</TE>
<TE>   In addition, investigators have concluded that Rodham, despite his
public statements to the contrary, has returned less than one-fourth of
the $204,000 fee that he said he had given back to the Vignali family.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also determined that President Clinton granted a pardon
to fugitive financier Marc Rich only after his sponsor, former White
House Counsel Jack Quinn, went around the Justice Department. Quinn
apparently did so on the advice of then-Deputy Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder
Jr., who was hoping to be elevated to attorney general if Al Gore was
elected president, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the committee said it found one e-mail from Holder to
Quinn, written during the 2000 presidential recount, telling him to "go
straight to wh [White House]" and that the "time is good" for a Rich
pardon.</TE>
<TE>   Holder has said that he learned of the Rich pardon just as Clinton was
about to leave office and had hoped that prosecutors in New York, where
Rich was convicted, were being allowed to give their recommendation
against the pardon.</TE>
<TE>   While strongly suggesting that laws were broken and that more FBI and
Justice Department investigation is needed, the committee stopped short
of alleging criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   However, the panel did note that a federal grand jury in New York has
been investigating the scandal for a year, implying that criminal charges
could eventually result.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clinton, in an interview last year with The Times, insisted that
he asked his brother to pardon only six of his closest friends, none of
whom received pardons, and that he never asked for or received
compensation for those efforts. But the House committee has found a
completely different picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger Clinton engaged in a systematic effort to trade on his
brother's name," the report said, and that most of those efforts involved
pardons.</TE>
<TE>Use of Connections Reportedly Encouraged</TE>
<TE>   "President Clinton encouraged Roger Clinton to capitalize on their
relationship," the report said. "At the beginning of his second term,
President Clinton instructed Roger Clinton to use his connections to the
administration to gain financial advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The report quotes George Locke, a former Arkansas state senator and
close associate of Roger Clinton, as saying "that Bill Clinton had
instructed him that since this was his last term in office, Roger should
find a way to make a living and use his relationship with the president
to his advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Locke has refused to publicly discuss his relationship with the
Clintons after the pardon scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The committee describes Roger Clinton as so eager to make money from
pardons that he even approached Rita Lavelle, a former Reagan
administration Environmental Protection Agency official.</TE>
<TE>   Lavelle had been convicted of perjury in the 1980s, and she told the
committee that she was approached by a Roger Clinton intermediary who
asked for $30,000 for Roger to hand-carry her pardon petition to the
president. She said she could not afford to pay that, but that Roger
"agreed to deliver the petition anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the last night of the Clinton presidency, Roger asked her,
"Do you have $100,000 to get this through?" Being bankrupt, she laughed
and said no. Her pardon request was not granted.</TE>
<TE>   In the Vignali case, the committee found that Hugh Rodham repeatedly
"provided false and misleading information" to the White House about the
Los Angeles man's criminal history and advised the administration that
the commutation for Vignali was "very important" to his sister,
then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Now-Sen. Clinton (D-N.Y.) has denied any knowledge of her brother's
work on behalf of Vignali.</TE>
<TE>   The report adds that Hugh Rodman repaid only $50,000 of his $204,000
fee from the Vignali family and "has no plans to return the remaining
$154,000."</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Rodham has repeatedly refused to discuss his work on behalf of
the Vignalis.</TE>
<TE>   Holder, the deputy attorney general in the Clinton White House, has
denied that his desire to be attorney general had anything to do with his
involvement in the Rich pardon.</TE>
<TE>   But, the report says, this incentive "provides a much clearer and more
believable motivation than any offered by Holder to date."</TE>
<TE>   The report also explores Roger Clinton's relationships with foreign
governments. It says Roger received "substantial sums of money" from
foreign governments and that he tried to pass some of the money on to his
brother, only to be repeatedly told the president could not accept it.</TE>
<TE>'Unexplained' Checks Said to Be Received</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clinton received at least $335,000 in "unexplained" blank
travelers' checks from Taiwan, South Korea and Venezuela, the report
says, and he also was paid $30,000 by a company to lobby his brother to
loosen U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The committee said Roger "participated in a plot to obtain a
$35,000-per-month contract" from an Alabama airport promoter in exchange
for urging then-Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to speak at a
company gathering.</TE>
<TE>   The report also describes other Roger Clinton ventures, such as his
previously reported receipt of $50,000 from an alleged organized crime
family to win clemency for convicted drug dealer Rosario Gambino and a
"substantial portion" of $225,000 put up by a Texas family to help
Garland Lincecum be released from prison on fraud charges.</TE>

<HD>Illegal Immigrants Aided on Residency Bid in House Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The House approved legislation Tuesday that would allow thousands
of foreigners to seek legal residency in the United States, even though
they are in the country illegally.</LD>
<LD>   The 275-137 vote handed President Bush, an advocate of the measure, a
victory he can tout as a sign of U.S. goodwill toward immigrants when he
travels to Latin America next week. It also was a defeat for lawmakers,
mostly Republicans, who favor restricting immigration.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, considered under rules that required a two-thirds
majority for passage, cleared the House by the barest of margins. A
one-vote switch would have defeated it. The measure now heads to the
Senate, which has already given broad bipartisan approval to similar
legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Bush praised the House action, saying it would help keep families
together and make America a "more welcoming society." He urged the Senate
to pass the measure quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the House bill would allow thousands of potential
immigrants--most of whom entered the country illegally or overstayed
visas--to remain with their families while they complete paperwork to
obtain a precious green card entitling them to settle in the United
States. To do so, applicants would have to pay a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Without the exemption, the immigrants would be forced to return to
their native countries to file an application. Once there, they could be
barred from reentry for up to 10 years--a major disincentive to many of
those who would otherwise make a bid to become legal residents.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a similar four-month program drew 400,000 applicants.
Wedding chapels in cities across the country, including Los Angeles, were
thronged by people hoping to emerge from the migrant underground by
marrying a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates estimate 200,000 or more people could step forward
under a renewal of the program, many from Southern California. But others
say the numbers this time could be much smaller, in the tens of
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   The window of opportunity opened by the measure would be narrow. The
provision would apply only to foreigners who had obtained a qualifying
sponsor--through employment with a U.S. company, for example, or
marriage--before Aug. 15, 2001. They would have until Nov. 30 of this
year to apply for an adjustment of their immigration status.</TE>
<TE>   Then the measure would end.</TE>
<TE>   A leading House Republican who backed the measure, Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, noted that its provisions would "not
become a permanent part of our immigration law, and [illegal immigrants]
should not base their future actions on the assumption that it will be."</TE>
<TE>   Assessments of the measure's effect varied sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we talk about unification of families, there's always
going to be high demand," said Ben Monterroso, Western regional director
of the Service Employees International Union, based in Los Angeles, which
supported the measure. "It's a step in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   But Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council of La Raza,
a Latino rights group, said: "It's an incredibly modest proposal which
doesn't ultimately help very many people. In some ways, it's more
symbolically important than substantively important."</TE>
<TE>   Some immigration lawyers said they worry that the measure would be
misunderstood by people who believe, erroneously, that Congress is moving
toward a general amnesty for illegal immigrants. Some also fear that
swindlers will profit from people who think they could be eligible for
the bill's provisions but are not. Anyone seeking to get married this
year, for example, to gain sponsorship for a green card would not
qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "People will lose a lot of money from fraud," said Judy Golub of the
American Assn. of Immigration Lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was packaged in the House with another measure to authorize
$300 million to beef up border security and improve the tracking of
foreign visitors, a response to the security failures exposed by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the House debate centered on the temporary exceptions to
immigration rules.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who largely supported the measure, lamented that the
program, known in immigration law as 245(i), would not be made permanent.
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) charged that the
legislation "fails to adequately recognize the importance of this
provision in reuniting immigrant families."</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt said Bush was "unable to convince congressional Republicans
to work with him in securing a more meaningful extension."</TE>
<TE>   Republican opponents said the bill went much too far, and their
arguments almost defeated it. On Tuesday, they mustered nearly 100 more
votes against the bill than they had when an earlier version passed the
House in a preliminary 336-43 vote last May.</TE>
<TE>   The narrower margin was a sign of heightened sensitivity of
immigration politics since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) called the bill "insulting
to all of the immigrants who obey our laws and are standing in lines
throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   And Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.) said the message of the bill
was: "Sneak in under the radar, stay here long enough, don't worry, we'll
get you amnesty."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates vigorously denied that the bill would grant amnesty. They
said it was limited to applicants who could show eligibility for a green
card.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent senators cheered the House action. The Senate approved a
similar bill without dissent in September.</TE>

<HD>Israel Invades Ramallah in Show of Might</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Operations in West Bank and Gaza reach highest pitch since
1967 war. U.N. Security Council endorses Palestinian statehood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli army took control of the West Bank city of Ramallah in
a massive display of force Tuesday, battling gunmen, digging trenches
across roads, searching homes and detaining hundreds of men in the nerve
center of the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<LD>   The siege of Ramallah and continued attacks in the Gaza Strip
represent Israel's largest military offensive in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since capturing the territories in the 1967 Middle East War. The
campaign follows a string of Palestinian suicide attacks on Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's invasion of Ramallah and overnight incursion into Gaza's
Jabaliya refugee camp were part of a 13-day-old, wide-scale hunt for
Palestinian gunmen in towns, villages and refugee camps. Thirty-five
Palestinians were killed in a 24-hour period ending Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   The army said it means to crush militias that are targeting Israelis,
but even as tanks patrolled Ramallah's streets, two gunmen opened fire on
Israeli motorists near the country's border with Lebanon, killing six
people and wounding seven before being slain by security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army chief of staff, told a committee of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament, that 20,000 troops were deployed in the
West Bank and Gaza and that the army has just called up 1,000 reservists
who live in Jewish settlements to guard their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the bloodletting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged
both sides to "lead your peoples away from disaster." In an especially
harsh criticism of Israel, he called on the Jewish state to end its
"illegal occupation" of Palestinian land and halt "the bombing of
civilian areas, the assassinations, the unnecessary use of lethal force,
the demolitions and the daily humiliation of ordinary Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   He also told the Palestinians that they were doing irreparable harm to
their own cause by failing to stop acts of terror, especially suicide
bombings, which he termed "morally repugnant."</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council approved, 14-0, a U.S.-drafted
resolution that for the first time endorses a Palestinian state. Syria
abstained from voting on the measure, which also calls for a cease-fire
and resumed negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution in part cites "a vision of a region where two states,
Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side within secure and recognized
borders."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, more than 100 tanks rolled into Ramallah, neighboring Al
Birah and the nearby village of Beitunia late Monday night, just three
days before U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni is due here to try again to
secure a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Troops and tanks stayed out of downtown Ramallah and didn't enter the
headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, although
they came close. They entered most other neighborhoods and the Al Amari
refugee camp in southern Ramallah, where hundreds of men were rounded up
for interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers issued calls on bullhorns for men and boys in Al
Amari to surrender. Residents said few complied. The Palestinian
Authority urged inhabitants to resist the troops, and Palestinians
reported that at least three policemen and two militia fighters were shot
dead in sporadic fighting with soldiers that raged through deserted
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tense," said Khaled Helou, a physician who lives in Al
Amari. "Everyone is waiting for something worse to happen. We're getting
ready for something big."</TE>
<TE>   Army bulldozers broke Ramallah's main water lines when they dug a
trench down the main road, and water gushed from the underground pipes
for hours. Soldiers took over an apartment building in Al Amari and
demolished a home belonging to a female suicide bomber who killed herself
and an elderly Israeli in January.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the shooting raged around Ramallah's hospital, where tanks
took up position early in the day. Younis Khatib, director of the
Palestine Red Crescent Society, said tanks fired on an approaching
ambulance. The tanks pulled back in midafternoon but returned by dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian gunmen of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade shot dead a
suspected collaborator and strung him by his feet from a metal sculpture
in Ramallah's main square. Gunmen accused him of having betrayed three
members of the militia to the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Army Col. Gal Hirsh said the Ramallah invasion was meant to "put a
wall between the terrorists and Israeli citizens."</TE>
<TE>   But as Hirsh briefed reporters in Jerusalem, two Palestinian gunmen
took up position on a slope above a road in northern Israel and opened
fire on passing motorists. Three women, the teenage daughter of one of
them, and a police officer were among the six shot dead. Seven others
were injured. The gunmen reportedly wore Israeli army uniforms and were
armed with Kalashnikov rifles.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a boom, and my front windshield took a shot," bus driver
Mousa Ayoub said. "I stepped on the gas and heard shooting from both
directions. It is a miracle I was saved."</TE>
<TE>   The attack occurred on the road between Kibbutz Metsuba and the town
of Shlomi, just inside the border with Lebanon, in northwestern Israel.
Large numbers of soldiers and police were deployed to Kibbutz Metsuba, a
sleepy communal farm with 550 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Moran Sivan, 28, a postal worker, said she was alone in her kibbutz
home when she heard gunfire. "I ran up to the dining hall," she said in a
telephone interview, "and I saw the bus, and I saw the driver. You could
see where the bullets hit the bus."</TE>
<TE>   Sivan said she and other kibbutz members were in a state of shock. "No
one ever thought this would reach us," Sivan said. "We felt pretty safe
until now" from the suicide attacks that have been mostly focused on
cities inside pre-1967 Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military intelligence has for months charged that the Lebanese
Shiite militia Hezbollah is trying to open a second front on the border
to help Palestinians who have been battling Israel since September 2000.
Hezbollah periodically shells the Shabaa Farms area that Israel seized
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War. Hezbollah claims the area belongs
to Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reports of the shooting attack on Route 70 said the gunmen
were believed to have infiltrated from Lebanon. As the drama unfolded,
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres phoned Annan to ask that he appeal
to Syria and Lebanon to rein in Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, Israeli security forces said that they had no evidence
there had been an incursion from Lebanon and that they suspected the
gunmen were Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have vowed to carry out attacks inside Israel to avenge
the deaths of scores of gunmen and civilians killed during the army's
raids in the first days of this month.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Israeli armor and infantry pulled out of
Jabaliya after 18 Palestinians were killed in two hours. Later,
helicopter gunships shelled a welding factory in Khan Yunis, killing four
workers. The army alleged the factory was producing weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsh said the army had "no choice" but to pursue militants into the
heart of refugee camps and even Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last few weeks, we have been under massive, unprecedented
terrorist attack," Hirsh said. "We could not stand it anymore, and we
decided to act inside the Palestinian Authority areas."</TE>
<TE>   The army has arrested several dozen wanted men, destroyed 10 to 20
explosives laboratories and confiscated hundreds of weapons in the past
10 days, Hirsh said. In mass roundups of hundreds of Palestinian men and
boys in the refugee camps, the detainees were handcuffed, forced to strip
to their undershirts and blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsh apologized for soldiers who had penciled numbers on the hands of
some detainees, a practice he described as "a mistake" that was not army
policy.</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe Awaits Results of Election</HD>
<DH>Africa: Accusations of government misconduct fly as officials sift
through ballots. Final count is expected today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>As vote-counting in Zimbabwe's bitterly contested presidential
election got underway Tuesday, allegations of misconduct continued to
undermine the credibility of the poll.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition politicians, local election observers and foreign political
analysts charged that the government of longtime President Robert Mugabe
had used every trick in the book to try to maintain its grip on power,
indicating that no matter what the outcome, it would never concede
defeat.</LD>
<LD>   "With their investment in stealing the election, they can't possibly
let the opposition win," said John Prendergast, Africa program
co-director of the International Crisis Group, which monitored the vote.</LD>
<TE>   With 69% of districts reporting, Mugabe had about 55% of the votes to
42% for Morgan Tsvangirai, government officials said. The final tally was
expected sometime today.</TE>
<TE>   The election pitted Mugabe, this southern African nation's only leader
since its independence from Britain 22 years ago, against Tsvangirai, a
former trade unionist who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change, or MDC.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predicted that a victory for Mugabe would lead to an attempt
to eradicate any future serious challenge to his rule. They said a
low-intensity war against the opposition had already begun with the
harassment, assault and arrest of key MDC officials.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition party's secretary-general, Welshman Ncube, appeared in
a court here in the capital Tuesday, charged with high treason for
allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. He was later released on bail.
Tsvangirai and another opposition figure are also under investigation for
allegedly trying to kill the president.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have been arrested a long time ago," Information Minister
Jonathan Moyo said in an interview Tuesday. "It's just another example of
us bending over [backward] to accommodate [the opposition]. The plot is
real. They have questions to answer."</TE>
<TE>   Treason is a charge punishable by death. The MDC officials have denied
the assassination allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast said the government is likely to continue the intimidation
and arrest of high-ranking MDC officials in an attempt to weaken the
management structure of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "They will manufacture other charges," Prendergast said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, local civic groups condemned the election as fundamentally
flawed. The Norwegian Election Observation Mission, the largest group of
European monitors in Zimbabwe, echoed this sentiment, adding that the
poll failed to meet international standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Zimbabwe Election Support Network, a coalition of local
independent poll monitors, said that huge irregularities up to and during
the vote made a mockery of the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The group's criticism included flawed voter rolls; intimidation and
attacks on voters by police and ruling party militants; and the
assignment of polling stations in a way that government critics said
clearly favored Mugabe. Opposition officials said the reported turnouts
in pro-Mugabe areas didn't match the reports from their polling agents.
They also complained that MDC observers had been locked out of the
counting centers in Harare.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way these elections could be described as substantially
free and fair," said the local monitoring group's chairman, Reginald
Matchaba-Hove.</TE>
<TE>   Voting was originally scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, but a Harare
high court judge extended it into Monday after thousands of people were
left waiting Sunday night outside polling stations in the capital. On
Monday night, a judge rejected an opposition appeal to extend voting to a
fourth day.</TE>
<TE>   The government denied allegations of vote-rigging.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel very insulted that anybody in the world would think it
possible for us to compromise the integrity of the electoral process when
so many people are watching us," said Moyo, the information minister.</TE>
<TE>   Moyo said that everyone in line before polls closed Monday evening had
the opportunity to cast a ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's naive, simplistic and unreasonable to measure a free and fair
election by the length of a queue," Moyo said.</TE>
<TE>   Local and foreign observers and media watched as police, wielding
clubs and firing tear gas, forced thousands of Zimbabweans, many of whom
had waited three days to vote, to flee polling stations Monday night when
the government announced the election closed.</TE>
<TE>   Matchaba-Hove, the election monitoring official, warned that "a flawed
electoral process is a potential cause for conflict," and some observers
predicted an explosion of mass civil action that might involve a general
strike if Mugabe is declared the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwean Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri told state radio
Tuesday that the opposition will face the wrath of the law if it makes
trouble.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Takes Anti-Terror Message to Mideast</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Jordan's leadership sends clear signal of reluctance to
sign on to the Bush administration's efforts against Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan
</DL>
<LD>As he arrived Tuesday in the Middle East, Vice President Dick
Cheney stepped from the shelter of his high-security jet, through the
cordon of a kaffiyeh-clad honor guard and directly into what could be the
toughest mission of his tenure.</LD>
<LD>   Underlying his very public journey through the Middle East is very
private diplomacy. In the end, his efforts could help determine whether
President Bush gains the widespread international support he seeks to
carry his war against the Al Qaeda network beyond Afghanistan and deny
the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the Islamic world.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling far from the "secure, undisclosed location" to which he was
dispatched in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, he is the
highest-level--and most visible--U.S. official to venture to the Middle
East since the attacks.</LD>
<TE>   He began the job Tuesday night at Baraka Palace with Jordan's King
Abdullah II, the young monarch who is the beneficiary of U.S. support but
is nevertheless skeptical about Cheney's mission.</TE>
<TE>   The two men spent about two hours together, in a private meeting and
then with aides and at dinner, a White House official said. The official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cheney noted the role that
Jordan has played in Afghanistan, setting up the first hospital for the
U.S.-led coalition and helping remove land mines.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been a big help in Afghanistan. It's very positive to have an
Arab member of the coalition with troops on the ground," another Cheney
aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Such compliments aside, Abdullah "expressed hope for a solution to all
outstanding problems with Iraq through dialogue and peaceful means," the
king's office said in a palace statement--sending a clear, public signal
of reluctance to sign on to the Bush administration's efforts against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The statement also said Abdullah voiced Jordan's concern about "the
repercussions of any possible strike on Iraq and the dangers of that on
the stability and security of the region."</TE>
<TE>   In a rare measure, the vice president is flying aboard the aircraft
commonly used as Air Force One to transport the president. It offers
greater capacity, the vice president's aides said, for the expanded
delegation accompanying him. It also brings security, sophisticated
communications gear, convenience and the unmistakable imprimatur of the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   That could be useful in itself.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge facing Cheney is this: The United States wants to
eliminate the threat that the Bush administration says is posed by
chemical weapons and possibly other weapons of mass destruction in the
Iraqi arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   With the Jordanian prime minister, Ali abu Ragheb, at his side, Cheney
said on his arrival that he and the king would discuss the violence
tearing apart Israel and the Palestinian territories and the war in
Afghanistan, but also "the threat that weapons of mass destruction pose
to all of us." That was code for Iraq, and the weapons' potential reach
throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   But the would-be allies whom Cheney is courting recognize that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein remains popular among Palestinian and other Arab
populations, if not among Persian Gulf and Middle East elites, and any
attack would be certain to anger what is known as the "Arab street."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah met Sunday with a senior Iraqi official, Izzat Ibrahim. The
vice chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council told Abdullah
that "a strike on Iraq will be disastrous for Iraq and the region as a
whole and will threaten the security and stability of the Middle East," a
palace statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's 11-day, 12-nation trip, which began in London on Sunday and
will include nine Arab nations, Israel and Turkey, nearly circumnavigates
Iraq. It puts the vice president, whose only foreign travel during his
nearly 14 months in office has been to Canada, directly into a region
from which Al Qaeda has drawn its membership and to which it might try to
disperse.</TE>
<TE>   This is not unknown territory for the vice president.</TE>
<TE>   As chief executive officer of energy giant Halliburton Co., Cheney
worked long-standing contacts with Middle Eastern and Persian Gulf
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, as defense secretary in the first Bush administration, he
was the voice of impending military operations in the weeks and months
leading to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He traveled the same circuit he is
on now, just before the fighting broke out, to make certain that
political and military support was in place among the gulf emirs.</TE>
<TE>   But the world has changed since then.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole information revolution has taken place since the early
'90s, when public opinion wasn't a factor. Now, with some 21 Arabic TV
channels and all that information out there, the people make up their own
minds without respect to what their governments want them to think," said
Edward S. Walker, president of the Middle East Institute in Washington
and a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Cheney in unfamiliar political territory.</TE>
<TE>   Among the traditional roles of the vice president in the modern era is
that of carrying the president's message around the country--and catching
political flak for the president. Now he's doing it on an international
stage.</TE>
<TE>   On this trip, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was Ronald Reagan's
final White House chief of staff, "he isn't just the javelin thrower.
He's the javelin catcher as well."</TE>

<HD>Controversy Over S. Korea's C-List</HD>
<DH>Asia: Those named as Japan collaborators once made up Seoul's
elite. Publication has fueled political mudslinging in an election year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>The list of shame reads like a who's who of South Korean society.</LD>
<LD>   The former dean of a prestigious women's university helped recruit
Korean women who ended up as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during
World War II. The wartime publisher of Korea's largest newspaper ran
editorials urging youths to join the Japanese army. Church leaders
rallied congregations to donate gold jewelry for the war effort.</LD>
<LD>   Late last month, members of the South Korean National Assembly
released a list of 708 prominent people who are said to have collaborated
with the ironfisted Japanese occupation of the Korean peninsula between
1910 and 1945. Notwithstanding the passage of more than half a century
and the fact that all but one of the people named are dead, the list's
publication is stirring up emotions so raw that the events seem like they
happened yesterday.</LD>
<TE>   The timing of the publication is particularly awkward because in less
than three months Japan and South Korea will co-host the World Cup soccer
games, their largest joint effort since World War II. And with the
presidential election scheduled here in December, accusations that
various candidates are related to Japanese collaborators have become the
newest form of political mudslinging.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the subject is so sensitive in South Korea is that many
collaborators, their children and grandchildren became the core of the
nation's elite.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike France, where more than 10,000 people were executed after the
collapse of the Nazi-backed Vichy regime, efforts in this nation to
punish collaborators were nipped in the bud. Soon after the peninsula's
liberation at the end of the war, tensions flared between the U.S.- and
Soviet-administered sectors, leading to the creation of two nations in
1948 and the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. The struggle against communism
took precedence over settling old scores, and the U.S.-backed South
Korean government retained most of the bureaucrats from the wartime
period.</TE>
<TE>   "The money of the collaborators was not confiscated, and with this
money they and their descendants became the ruling class of the new,
liberated Korea," said Han Sang Bum, a law professor at Seoul's Dongguk
University who pushed for the release of the list. "People who would have
been shot or imprisoned in France became national heroes here."</TE>
<TE>   The list includes most of the famous poets, writers, composers and
artists of the early 20th century, people who are still revered by South
Korean schoolchildren. Beloved poet Mo Yun Suk wrote paeans to the
Japanese emperor. Painter Kim Eun Ho, considered the father of modern
Korean art, produced propaganda to support the war effort. And late
educator Helen Kim, head of Ewha Women's University, called on students
to join the Women's Patriot Service Corps, a ruse that led to thousands
being forced to become "comfort women," or prostitutes, for Japanese
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the list came on the eve of the March 1 celebration of
Independence Movement Day, a major South Korean holiday marking the
anniversary of an anti-Japanese uprising in 1919.</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup games are to begin May 30. Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi is to visit March 21. However, resentment still festers
here over a Japanese history textbook approved last year that South
Koreans believe glosses over the brutality of the occupation. Former
"comfort women" still demonstrate outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul,
the capital, seeking recompense for suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Those who prepared the list of collaborators insist that it has
nothing to do with Japan but rather is designed to help South Koreans
deal with their past.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will negatively influence the relationship with
Japan. This is a domestic issue," said Kim Hee Sun, an assemblywoman from
the ruling Millennium Democratic Party who spearheaded the release of the
list. "This is not to create divisions but for the sake of
reconciliation."</TE>
<TE>   Cho Moon Ki, 77, a former resistance fighter who has spent most of his
life on this issue, said he has given up on efforts to punish the
collaborators, almost all of whom are dead anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not trying to dig up the tombs of the deceased," Cho said.
"This is something we have to do for the next generation so that we can
restore our national pride and start out again right and clean."</TE>
<TE>   The publication of the list has not been popular in all quarters. Some
conservatives grumble that it might be better to leave skeletons in the
proverbial closet.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a danger that this will be used purely for political
purposes and turn into a witch hunt," said Lee Kang Doo, a leader of the
conservative opposition Grand National Party.</TE>
<TE>   He and others are upset with the procedure used to compile the list. A
semi-governmental agency known as the Rehabilitation Assn. prepared a
roster of 692 collaborators, but legislators who released the list added
16 names of prominent people who had been omitted because of their
contribution to Korean society. Others complain that the association
listed only the most prominent collaborators, leaving off civil service
workers and soldiers who served the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Just as U.S. politicians accuse their rivals of sexual peccadilloes,
accusations are flying fast and furious that the fathers of various
politicians were collaborators. The Confucian sense of family loyalty
makes such allegations far more shameful and politically damaging here
than in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither are on the list of 708, the late fathers of two
prospective candidates for the Dec. 19 presidential election face such
allegations. Former President Park Chung Hee, whose daughter Geun Hye is
likely to run, was a soldier in the Japanese army fighting the Korean
resistance. Front-runner Lee Hoi Chang's father was a prosecutor under
the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of collaborators is shrouded in partisan politics, with
leftists historically pressing for their prosecution and rightists
resisting. After World War II, North Korea vigorously prosecuted
collaborators with the Japanese and many fled south to escape.</TE>

<LD>As a light snow fell at dusk, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
showed up at the busy subway station on Pushkin Square here to place a
bouquet of red roses beneath a plaque marking the spot where a suitcase
bomb killed 13 and injured dozens Aug. 8, 2000. Powell bowed his head as
Russian TV cameras filmed the scene.</LD>
<LD>   The brief ceremony last December contrasted sharply with President
Clinton's visit here barely a month after the attack. Clinton never went
near the site. It was Powell's first stop on his maiden visit here as
secretary of State.</LD>
<LD>   "It's showing solidarity with the Russians," Powell said. "It's
showing that this kind of violence exists in many forms--not just in
America."</LD>
<TE>   The Pushkin Square tribute reflected a far-reaching consequence of the
Sept. 11 attacks--a transformation of relations between Russia and the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   At the dawn of the 21st century, the two countries are fighting the
same war. Half a century of superpower rivalry gave way to awkward
coexistence in the 1990s and has become a strategic partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is the Cold War over, the post-Cold War period is also
over," Powell said as relations between the countries warmed last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Russia quickly became one of America's most important allies in the
campaign against the Al Qaeda terrorist network. Moscow provided
political support and technical assistance for U.S. military operations
in Afghanistan and paved the way for an American military presence in the
former Soviet republics bordering the war zone.</TE>
<TE>   The new spirit also lent impetus to changes that were in motion before
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>Russia's New Stature Among NATO Nations</TE>
<TE>   With strong American backing, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
took the historic step in December of establishing formal cooperation
with Russia. The alliance and Russia will now meet regularly in a new
council to "pursue opportunities for joint action," according to a NATO
communique crafted largely by U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Moscow and Washington have agreed to a new framework for
strategic relations, including steep reductions in their nuclear
stockpiles. An agreement on arms reductions may be signed as early as
May, when President Bush is scheduled to visit Moscow for talks with
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries still have their differences. When Bush announced
tariffs on foreign steel imports last week, Russia retaliated by banning
imports of American poultry. And when Bush suggested that the U.S. might
extend the war on terrorism to Iraq, Putin declared that he saw no
justification for such a move.</TE>
<TE>   But such disputes now fit into a broader picture of U.S.-Russian
accommodation. The change is widely viewed as historic. "No Russian
leader since Peter the Great has cast his lot as much with the West as
Putin has," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The rapprochement is just one element in a broad realignment in U.S.
foreign policy sparked by Sept. 11. Overnight, priorities were redefined,
resources reallocated and troops redeployed. The war against terrorism
has taken precedence over all other foreign policy issues, even the
promotion of democracy and free markets.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, the former Texas governor who made just one foreign policy
speech during his presidential campaign, now finds himself prosecuting a
global war against terrorists from Somalia to the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "the most far-reaching geostrategic effect" of Sept. 11 is
likely to be the change in U.S.-Russian relations, said John L.
Helgerson, chairman of the National Intelligence Council, which provides
intelligence estimates to all branches of the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Helgerson said Russia's realignment is comparable to "the historic
post-World War II change, when Germany became solidly anchored into the
European and North Atlantic communities."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tensions that defined U.S.-Russian relations after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991--such as Kremlin worries over
American plans for a missile defense shield and Moscow's fears about NATO
expansion into Eastern Europe--have subsided.</TE>
<TE>   The new tone was set Sept. 11 when Putin phoned Bush to offer
condolences, using the hot line left over from the Cold War. It was the
first sympathy call Bush received from a foreign leader.</TE>
<TE>   The warming grew, in part, out of a pragmatic realization that the two
nations needed each other. The American interest in closer ties was
obvious: Better than any other nation, Russia knew the rough Afghan
terrain after its 1979-89 occupation of the nation. Moscow also had
influence in its former Central Asian republics, which have airfields and
military bases near the Afghan war front.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Russian leaders were pleased to see Washington giving
top priority to terrorism, a long-standing problem on many fronts in
Russia. After Sept. 11, the U.S. immediately eased pressure on Russia
over its suppression of the separatist rebellion in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   The new sense of common cause was evident at the NATO meeting in
Brussels in December, where the alliance and Russia agreed to create a
council for joint action on issues ranging from terrorism to missile
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov co-chaired a meeting with his
counterparts from NATO's 19 member countries around the same conference
table where Western military strategists plotted for decades against the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites.</TE>
<TE>   "We have turned an important corner in NATO-Russia relations," Ivanov
said. "What we are talking about is a mechanism that will enable us to
draft and adopt decisions together on the crucial issues of security that
will correspond to the spirit of the age."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Russian partnership is visible in Central Asia and its
predominantly Muslim countries of sweeping steppes, rugged mountains and
ancient trading centers along the old Silk Road. The Soviet empire's
southern flank until 1991, it is still a region Moscow considers
distinctly within its sphere of influence.</TE>
<TE>   Before the terrorist attacks, Central Asia was emerging as a source of
friction between Washington and Moscow. During talks in Powell's office
at the State Department last summer, Ivanov expressed concern about
heightened U.S. interest in a region that for decades was not even on the
American diplomatic horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "Igor was saying, 'I really don't like it when I see you guys doing
things,' " Powell recalled in an interview. "I said, 'What is it you're
bothered about?' He says, 'Well, we just know you're meddling around down
there and that's not good. That's our realm of influence.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 dispelled such worries.</TE>
<TE>   "Along comes this crisis, and within a few weeks the Russians are
comfortable about us being there," Powell said. "Now we've got bases in
Uzbekistan. We've got guys running around Tajikistan. We've got guys all
over the place, and all I have to do is call Igor and coordinate. He's
OK."</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Moscow in December, Powell brought up Central Asia
again to explore how Russia and the United States might expand their
collaboration beyond the war on terrorism. Ivanov outlined his
government's worries about instability in Central Asia--its concern that
illegal immigration, smuggling and drug trafficking could cause problems
in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Powell immediately saw an opportunity. "We can help you with those
problems more than you can help yourself," he told his Russian
counterpart. Among other things, he said, the United States could
encourage American investment to help create jobs and stabilize the new
independent states.</TE>
<TE>   Now Central Asia is an arena of cooperation between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not quite 'Let's tiptoe through the tulips together,' " Powell
said. "There will be tension. But if you had suggested this to a Russian
foreign minister a year ago, there would have been quite a different
response."</TE>
<TE>Putin Terms U.S. Plan for Georgia 'No Tragedy'</TE>
<TE>   The new spirit was evident in the Kremlin's reaction to a U.S. plan to
arm and train an anti-terrorist force in Georgia, a former Soviet
republic. When Russian politicians protested this month at what they saw
as American meddling, Putin quieted the uproar by pronouncing the U.S.
plan "no tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The scope of change in a mere six months has been clear in the most
contentious issue between the two nations: the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty crafted during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment he took office, Bush raised the possibility of
amending or withdrawing from the 1972 treaty, considered the cornerstone
of nuclear arms control. With equal determination, Putin insisted on
keeping it, pointing out that it had helped keep the peace between the
countries for a generation. The dispute created fears of a new arms race
that might expand to include China and India.</TE>
<TE>   But as Bush prepared to announce America's withdrawal from the treaty
in December, Putin felt sufficiently secure in his new relationship with
Washington that he lodged no serious protest.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Powell and Ivanov quietly choreographed the U.S. announcement
and the Russian reaction to minimize the appearance of discord.</TE>
<TE>   There is now a firm consensus among American conservatives and
liberals alike that the new bonds are genuine and enduring.</TE>
<TE>   "The hallmark of the 20th century was the great power rivalry," said
Richard Haass, chief of policy and planning for the State Department. "At
the beginning of the 21st century, we've ensured that it's now over."</TE>

<LD>Myanmar's ruling junta said that reconciliation talks with
pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi would not be derailed by
the discovery of a coup plot led by the cronies of an elderly former
dictator.</LD>
<LD>   The government says the conspiracy was masterminded by a son-in-law
and three grandsons of Ne Win, a military strongman who ruled Myanmar,
formerly Burma, for 26 years until his retirement in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The military has been holding reconciliation talks since October 2000
with Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy won elections in 1990
but was not allowed to take power.</LD>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The defiant alleged mastermind of the kidnapping and slaying of
Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl warned Tuesday that
Americans will suffer if he is sent to the United States, shouting to
bystanders after a court appearance that "America will be finished soon."</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh and co-defendant Sheikh Mohammed Adeel
appeared Tuesday before a judge who gave the government 10 more days to
continue its investigation before a trial date is set.</LD>
<LD>   Saeed's lawyer, Khawaja Naveed, said police have fabricated evidence
and asked the court to set a date for the trial or release his client.</LD>
<TE>   The United States also has expressed interest in trying the
British-born Islamic militant, but Pakistan says he must stand trial here
first.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, the Journal's South Asia correspondent, was kidnapped in
Karachi on Jan. 23 while researching links between Pakistani extremists
and Richard C. Reid, who was arrested in December with explosives in his
shoe on a flight between Paris and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a videotape received by the U.S. Consulate in Karachi
confirmed Pearl's death. His body has not been found, and some suspects
remain at large.</TE>

an armored personnel carrier accompanied by nine police vehicles.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Declares Coalition Victory in High Valley</HD>
<DH>Military: Local and U.S. troops have taken control at Shahi Kot,
general says. Forces are reportedly searching caves and collecting
bodies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A top commander of Afghan forces today declared a total victory in
the battle at Shahi Kot, saying Afghan and U.S. troops had occupied the
high mountain valley and were in full control on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "The valley is completely purged," said Gen. Abdul Wahab Joyendah,
military chief of staff for the Afghan zone that includes Shahi Kot.
"Just two high points on the snowcapped mountains on the other side of
Shahi Kot have remained unexplored," he said, citing a fresh report that
a senior officer brought from the front line this morning.</LD>
<LD>   Joyendah said Afghan troops had discovered documents in Arabic and
Chechen along with a number of weapons and that they were being handed
over to American forces.</LD>
<TE>   He also said the Americans were in the process of taking away an
unknown number of wounded Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters and removing
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Afghan forces are in the valley now, and they are searching and
cleansing the entire valley and its caves," Joyendah said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan forces entered the valley Tuesday and, according to Afghan and
U.S. officials, met with only small pockets of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, B-52 bombers and U.S. attack helicopters flew over the
valley seeking out Al Qaeda and Taliban targets, while on the ground the
more than 1,000 newly arrived Afghan troops began inching forward in
search of the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Hanan, a fighter at a checkpoint in the village of Lakdiwal in
eastern Afghanistan, said Tuesday that the Afghan troops had already
breached one front line and found several bodies and collapsed caves. The
five bodies appeared to include some foreign Al Qaeda fighters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least one gun battle took place, according to a radio transmission
overheard by reporters. But Al Qaeda and Taliban forces "appear to be in
smaller pockets than they were in the early days" of 11-day-old Operation
Anaconda, U.S. Army spokesman Maj. Bryan Hilferty said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Americans died in the first days of the attempt to dislodge the
holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   On the flat, dusty plain that leads to one of the entrances to the
Shahi Kot valley, trucks moved in the distance. In the morning haze,
giant Chinook helicopters could be spotted going to and fro, presumably
removing more U.S. troops from the battle area. At one point, they
appeared to be ferrying small vehicles into the valley.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty, speaking Tuesday at Bagram air base north of Kabul, the
capital, said about 2,000 troops were in the Shahi Kot valley, with
Afghans slightly outnumbering international coalition forces for the
first time in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it always was an 'Afghanized' operation," he said. "The ratio
might change, [but] I would tell you, [U.S. troops are] not pulling out."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr. said that
although some U.S. troops had been pulled out of the battle, others had
moved in, maintaining the number of American forces in the area at the
level that it had been for more than a week.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bombers and fighter jets had dropped more than 100 bombs in the
battle zone since Monday, Rosa said, bringing the total to more than
2,500 bombs since the fighting began March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Near the village of Lakdiwal, a Cobra attack helicopter circled
overhead and a Sea Stallion helicopter descended to the desert floor in a
cloud of brown dust late in the afternoon. Its crew got out and wrestled
some sort of heavy bulky object lying on the ground into its hold.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters were kept from solving the mystery by a seemingly mad Afghan
sentry in the employ of U.S. forces--a bearded martinet in black ski cap
who sometimes flailed a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in their
direction, and once cocked his rifle and pointed it toward them, all to
get the journalists to drop back 50 paces. After such off-and-on
exertions, he would drop down for a rest on a piece of dirty cardboard.</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, the capital of Paktia province, a spokesman for the shura,
or council, said that the newly arrived troops under Gen. Gul Hydar had
all been deployed along a hilltop ridge at the edge of the Shahi Kot
valley.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearby town of Zormat, a local elder had said Tuesday that
proposals were still being floated among Afghans to try to bring about a
cease-fire and allow the remaining Al Qaeda and Taliban supporters to
quietly leave the valley and go elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The town's deputy security chief, Ghulam Mohammed Farooqi, said Hydar
met with the Zormat shura Monday and told the council that if it wanted
to send out peace feelers to Mullah Saifur Rahman Mansour, the commander
believed to be leading the resistance in the mountains, Hydar would
guarantee the holdouts a 10-day halt in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that no decision had been made on whether to send a
peace mission to Rahman.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had repeatedly said that they would accept only an
unconditional surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Farooqi had invited reporters into a small meeting room to voice
bitterness at what he characterized as an unjustified arrest last week by
U.S. forces of his brother, Mohammed Naim Farooqi, who had been the chief
of security in Zormat, on suspicion of cooperating with the Taliban and
Al Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest has generated much ill will in Zormat, a town with strong
Taliban ties. Farooqi said emotions have been heightened by the
appointment of Afghan commander Abdul Matin as the new security chief in
the district as of Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fresh fears for the security of Western journalists
prompted several news organizations to leave Paktia on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Warlords to Report on Alleged Killings</HD>
<DH>Justice: Three Afghan chiefs are asked by Karzai government to
investigate claims that their troops massacred Pushtuns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Three powerful warlords have been asked to investigate claims that
their troops committed acts of "ethnic cleansing" against Pushtuns in
northern Afghanistan, a spokesman for the interim government said here
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. officials claim that attacks by other ethnic forces against
Pushtuns, who dominated the Taliban regime, have created waves of new
internal refugees since the Taliban was driven from power.</LD>
<LD>   In the northern village of Bargah, witnesses said, 37 Pushtuns were
dragged from their homes and slain late last year. Similar incidents,
including allegations of sexual assault, have been reported across
northern Afghanistan. Witnesses and U.N. officials describe the assaults
as acts of retaliation against Pushtuns who supported the Taliban regime.</LD>
<TE>   Government spokesman Yusuf Nuristani described the accounts as
"exaggerated and unsubstantiated" but said warlords commanding ethnic
Hazara, Uzbek and Tajik forces have been asked to investigate the claims.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there have been some minor incidents, but mostly these are
rumors," Nuristani said. But he said that interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai personally asked warlords Gens. Abdul Rashid Dostum, Ata Mohammed
and Haji Mohammed Mukhaqiq to look into the reported incidents. Dostum,
who serves as assistant defense minister in the interim government,
commands ethnic Uzbeks; Mohammed commands ethnic Tajiks; and Mukhaqiq
leads ethnic Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Nuristani said, three members of Karzai's government have
been asked to independently "assess and evaluate the reports."</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the ethnic groups stems from the brutal treatment
of other groups by the Taliban. In its sweep to power in the mid- and
late 1990s, the fundamentalist Sunni Muslim Taliban forces committed
massacres against other minorities, particularly the Shiite Muslim
Hazaras and the Uzbeks. Tajiks formed the bulk of the Northern Alliance,
the Taliban's main foe.</TE>
<TE>   If Karzai, a Pushtun, wants to succeed as Afghanistan's leader, he
must calm the simmering tensions with these groups. Karzai is viewed
warily by the three major northern ethnic groups but also finds himself
criticized by Pushtuns for having what they feel are too many non-Pushtun
northerners in his administration.</TE>

<HD>Danger, Death Fill a Gaza Strip Camp</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Refugees put up a fight as Israeli tanks roll in, leaving
18 Palestinians dead and dozens wounded.</DH>

<DL>JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip
</DL>
<LD>The inhabitants of this teeming refugee camp cowered as Israeli
tanks slammed through their rutted streets Tuesday. Most Palestinian
gunmen had fled ahead of the Israeli incursion, but Bajhat Skheleh and a
band of armed comrades put up a fight.</LD>
<LD>   Skheleh and the others were taking shots at tanks and armored vehicles
when suddenly a Palestinian car pulled up. The car carried three dead
men--including Skheleh's brother Mohammed. When Skheleh went to retrieve
abandoned weapons at another location, he found his other brother, Hani,
bleeding to death.</LD>
<LD>   In scarcely two hours, 18 Palestinians were killed and at least 45
wounded in a fierce overnight operation Monday and early Tuesday, part of
Israel's 13-day-old campaign to crush armed resistance in the crowded,
impoverished camps that are home to refugees from Israel's 1948 War of
Independence. Jabaliya is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the
world and has historically led the fight against Israeli occupation.</LD>
<TE>   With Tuesday's siege of the Al Amari camp in the newly reoccupied West
Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli forces will have raided eight camps, home
to about 200,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is waging against the
Palestinians is very much about the refugee camps, the sanctuary and
breeding ground of the resistance that he has sought to eliminate for
most of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight in Jabaliya, the tanks and troops roared up Saleh
Dardona Street, named for a man killed in the first intifada against
Israeli rule. That uprising lasted from 1987 to 1993. Soldiers laid
explosive charges inside the aluminum factory where Muslei Sultan says he
produces tea trays. The blast flattened the building, destroying Sultan's
business of 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers ordered families who lived in apartments above the factory to
evacuate before the explosion but gave them no time to collect any
belongings or clothing, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Up the road a short time later, soldiers similarly blew up a dozen or
so machines in a metalworks factory owned by Nabil Tannira.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, and in the demolition of other workshops, the Israeli
army said it was destroying factories used to produce rockets, mortars
and other weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, it's not clear what the raid on Jabaliya achieved. Unlike
the operations at other camps, there was no mass roundup of men nor
seizure of weapons. The tanks pulled out early Tuesday, almost as quickly
as they entered, without penetrating the center of the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those killed and wounded appeared to have been gunmen or
militants in the radical Islamic movement Hamas. Mourning tents popped up
all over Jabaliya, and funerals were held en masse, complete with men
firing automatic weapons and chanting for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   But civilians were also among the dead. Among the first to die were
Abdul Rahman Izzedeen, 54, and his son Walid, 36.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked out the window and saw three tanks," said the older man's
daughter-in-law Saleh. "I was so scared. They would shoot at anybody.
People were running all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   The elder Izzedeen, worried about his children and grandchildren,
climbed the stairs of his three-story house. His last words were to call
down to the family: "Gather up the children. Stay inside, be careful."</TE>
<TE>   Izzedeen then reached for the door leading to the roof to pull it
closed. Israeli soldiers who had taken up position on the upper floors of
a house two buildings over shot him, his family said. He fell, blood
gushing from his face and neck. Walid, rushing to help his father, was
then shot as well. Both died. It took several hours for an ambulance to
reach the home, the family said.</TE>
<TE>   The Izzedeens--Abdul Rahman left behind a wife and 11 children, and
Walid left behind a wife and eight children--had moved to their home on
the edge of the camp only a year ago. It allowed them to escape the worst
of the Jabaliya misery. The center of the camp--a warren-like collection
of cinder-block shacks, muddy alleyways and barefoot children--is an
awful place, even during times of peace.</TE>
<TE>   And worse in times of war. On Tuesday, residents of this camp that has
produced suicide bombers and shooters were seething at the destruction
wrought by the Israeli incursion. Outside the Izzedeens' home, in large
black block letters, the graffiti read: "Hey Jews, you cowards. We swear
we will answer your aggression. Just wait."</TE>

<HD>Journalists Come Under Fire at West Bank Hotel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces fired for 10 to 15 minutes from tank-mounted machine
guns on a hotel where journalists were photographing armor targeting the
Al Amari refugee camp early Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured in the shooting, which sprayed the glass-enclosed
stairwell and nearby rooms where about 40 journalists were working. An
ABC television camera left running on a tripod when the journalists took
cover was hit by seven bullets--one directly in the lens.</LD>
<LD>   The army said that the tanks were returning fire from a gunman
somewhere on the upper floors of the hotel and that troops were unaware
that journalists were working from the building. "It was dark," a
spokesperson said. An investigation was continuing, the army said.</LD>
<TE>   The reporters said there were no gunmen in the four-story New City
Inn, where about 40 television and photo journalists covering the army
assault on Al Amari were working from the upper floors.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a gunman, I would not stay in the building for one
minute," said ABC television news producer Nasser Atta, who has 13 years'
experience covering conflicts in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The journalists, working mostly for U.S. and European media outlets,
had chosen the hotel about 300 to 400 yards from the camp's perimeter
because it was well situated to observe the army assault without being
caught in the cross-fire, Atta said. All the rooms were occupied by
journalists except for four rented to a Swedish company, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The journalists recorded the assault on the camp undisturbed for about
40 minutes before two tanks turned and opened fire from machine guns
without warning about 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The firing stopped after the journalists contacted the army to inform
officials that they were in the hotel, Atta said. The army said it
apologized to the journalists for any damage to equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists in the hotel at the time were working for the U.S.
networks ABC and CNN, Italy's Rai Uno, Germany's ARD, the Qatar-based
satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera, Reuters, Agence France-Presse and
Associated Press.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Council Endorses a State for Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Security Council approved a resolution Tuesday night endorsing
a Palestinian state for the first time, supporting a U.S. measure that
also calls for an immediate cease-fire in the escalating
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<LD>   American U.N. Ambassador John D. Negroponte said Washington's surprise
move aimed to give momentum to the peace mission being launched this week
by its Middle East envoy Anthony C. Zinni.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution came hours after Syria tabled a Palestinian-backed
resolution. The U.S. measure won support from 14 of the 15 council
members, with Syria abstaining.</LD>
<TE>   The council has adopted a number of resolutions over the years calling
for Mideast peace, but none had referred to the contentious issue of a
Palestinian state. President Bush and other administration leaders
recently have called for a Palestinian state, as have other nations.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution also demanded an "immediate cessation of all acts of
violence, including all forms of terror, provocation, incitement and
destruction" and called on Israelis and Palestinians to work together
toward a cease-fire with the goal of resuming peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   In last-minute negotiations, U.S. officials added the sentence
"affirming a vision of a region where two states, Israel and Palestine,
live side-by-side within secure and recognized borders."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on behalf of Arab nations, Syrian U.N. Ambassador Mikhail
Wehbe labeled the measure "very weak," saying it doesn't deal with the
roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--"the question of the Israeli
occupation."</TE>
<TE>   Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinian U.N. observer, welcomed the council's
first reference to two states. Even though the Palestinians didn't
support everything in the text, he indicated that if he had a vote he
would have approved it.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Yehuda Lancry, said he could welcome a
"balanced" Security Council resolution on the Mideast, which he called "a
rare and remarkable" occurrence.</TE>

<HD>India Court Bars Prayer Vigil</HD>
<DH>Asia: Panel says Hindu service can't be allowed near site of razed
mosque until cases are settled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>India's Supreme Court today ruled against Hindu nationalist demands
to hold a symbolic prayer ceremony near the site of a razed 16th century
mosque.</LD>
<LD>   Standing by the court's 1994 decision, a three-judge panel ruled that
no religious ceremonies would be allowed near the disputed site until
several legal cases were settled.</LD>
<LD>   The panel asked the government to detail efforts to ensure that
religious riots would not break out if the ceremony were to go ahead.</LD>
<TE>   The mosque site was a partial cause of the religious violence that has
engulfed the western state of Gujarat in recent weeks. More than 600
people have been killed in religious violence that erupted Feb. 27 when
Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindus returning from a pilgrimage
to the holy site in the northern city of Ayodhya. Hindus went on a
revengeful rampage, destroying Muslim businesses and burning Muslims
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu priests and fundamentalists have insisted that no matter what
the court ruled, they intend to pray near the ruins of the Babri mosque
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Hindus said they would dedicate stones or pillars that will be
used in a temple they hope to build where the mosque once stood in
Ayodhya.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, thousands of Hindus were trying to head toward Ayodhya.
Hard-line Hindus--from the same ideological family as the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party--have vowed to take part in the prayer ceremony,
or puja, and show their support for the temple plans.</TE>
<TE>   "No court can stop us performing the puja. If it does, it will be
injustice against the Hindus," said Haresh Bhatt, from the hard-line
Vishwa Hindu Parishad in Gujarat.</TE>
<TE>   He said 1,000 people were leaving by train for Ayodhya on Tuesday and
dismissed police warnings that they would be arrested. "If we can't catch
the train tonight, there are other ways to go. But we will be in Ayodhya
by March 15," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslims see a prayer session as a prelude to the building of the
temple on the site of the mosque, which was razed by Hindu extremists in
1992, triggering nationwide riots in which at least 2,000 people were
killed. The Hindu hard-liners say the structure was built by Muslim
invaders on the birthplace of the Hindu god-king Ram.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is at the root of India's worst communal violence in a
decade, which began late last month when a Muslim mob attacked a train
carrying Hindu activists from Ayodhya, killing 58.</TE>
<TE>   That sparked reprisals in which the more than 600 people, mostly
Muslims, were killed in Gujarat. Thousands of Muslims are still staying
in relief camps, too frightened to go home.</TE>
<TE>   In Gujarat's commercial capital, Ahmadabad, about 500 armed police and
paramilitary soldiers guarded the railway station where Hindu devotees
have threatened to catch the Sabarmati Express--the same train torched in
February.</TE>
<TE>   One hard-liner said even if police arrested identifiable activists,
about 500 would go anyway as regular passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The train goes as far as Ayodhya, although authorities are now
diverting railway traffic to prevent passengers from getting off there or
in the neighboring town of Faizabad.</TE>
<TE>   In Calcutta, in eastern India, senior police official N.C. Ghosh said
police were checking trains, buses and railway stations to stop
activists, but he said it would be impossible to stop each and every
individual from getting through.</TE>
<TE>   Ajay Nandi of Vishwa Hindu Parishad told reporters in Calcutta that he
expected about 8,000 activists to go to Ayodhya from the region.</TE>
<TE>   In Bombay, Vishwa Hindu Parishad said it would hold its own prayer
ceremony Friday even if the Supreme Court ruled against it.</TE>
<TE>   Vyankatesh Abdev, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader in the western state of
Maharashtra, said Muslims need not fear the worst since the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad also wanted peace. But he warned Muslims of retaliation if they
tried to provoke Hindu volunteers heading for Ayodhya.</TE>

<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Although "spectacular gains" have been made against some
nutritional deficiencies, one-third of children in the developing world
are malnourished, according to a report released today.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the United Nations Children's Fund found that child
malnutrition in the developing world had fallen from 32% to 28%, or about
150 million children in all. But nearly half the children in South Asia
and nearly one-third in sub-Saharan Africa were malnourished, the report
said.</LD>
<LD>   "The familiar symbol of the visibly starving child misrepresents the
problem. In reality, most malnutrition is totally invisible," according
to the report, "Malnutrition: The News."</LD>
<TE>   Frequent illness, not a lack of food, is the major factor in
malnutrition, the report said. An overwhelming majority of malnourished
children live in homes with enough food, according to the study. Illness
can cause a lack of appetite, and vomiting and diarrhea deplete vital
nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of malnourished children develop the condition in
the first three years of life.</TE>

<HD>White House Will Ask Congress for Help on Colombia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will seek legislative changes to give it
more flexibility in helping the Colombian government fight rebels,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Congress has put limits on U.S. security assistance to Colombia in the
campaign against the drug trade, but the Colombian military's new
priority is an offensive against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has been hinting for weeks that it might ask
Congress to expand the scope of U.S. security assistance to Colombia to
include the campaign against the FARC, which Washington lists as a
terrorist organization.</LD>
<TE>   Powell said last week that a policy review was underway on whether the
United States could help beyond the drug war.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, speaking to a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, he said, "We do believe we should help this democracy that is
being threatened by narco-traffickers and terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, we will be sending up [to Congress], in the not too
distant future, language which would give us greater flexibility with
respect to the kind of support we can provide," he added.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official said he had not seen specific legislative
proposals. The administration might decide to include a proposal in a
request for extra appropriations money later this year, he added.</TE>
<TE>   After peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC broke
down last month, government forces started moving into the demilitarized
zone they had ceded to the rebels in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has promised to share more intelligence information
and speed up deliveries of military equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said, "They're not asking for U.S. troops, nor do I see U.S.
troops going to Colombia."</TE>
<TE>   In the past two years, the United States has given Colombia more than
$1 billion for the war against cocaine and heroin, but without making any
tangible impact on production.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said last week that the area of Colombia planted with
coca--the source of cocaine--grew by 24.7% in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Rebel Group 'Studying' Truce Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The rebel National Liberation Army said Tuesday that it was
studying a truce accord, but a powerful car bomb that killed seven people
showed other guerrillas intend to continue their attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The group, known by its Spanish initials ELN, said in a communique
from Havana that talks with the government had led to a truce proposal.
The truce would include international monitors.</LD>
<LD>   "We have started studying a truce accord, which would become a
tangible sign of peace for Colombians," said the Cuban-inspired rebel
force.</LD>
<TE>   "A truce is not a definitive peace accord. It is the first step, meant
to ease the development in negotiations to find a political solution," it
added.</TE>
<TE>   The government and the ELN, founded in the early 1960s by followers of
the Cuban revolution, have been meeting in Havana since December.
Political analysts say outgoing President Andres Pastrana needs to clinch
an accord with the 5,000-member rebel force to secure his legacy before
stepping down in August.</TE>
<TE>   But the obstacles ahead were underlined by a powerful car bomb that
killed three soldiers and four civilians in a small town bordering a
former FARC rebel safe haven. The FARC, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, is the country's main rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve others were injured in the blast, which the military blamed on
the FARC. A doctor in Puerto Lleras said three victims had been
hospitalized in serious condition. Local residents said the bomb exploded
outside an abandoned police station, laying waste to the area as it
sprayed passersby with shards of glass and rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "A loud explosion rang out; it shook the whole town. Then a huge
column of smoke billowed upward," said Delsy Jimenez, who works at Puerto
Lleras' mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident, the army said a FARC rebel was killed while
driving a car packed with explosives to a detonation site within the
former safe haven. The car exploded prematurely, killing the driver. No
one else was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana jettisoned 3-year-old peace talks with the 17,000-member FARC
on Feb. 20 after the Marxist-inspired rebels hijacked a commercial
airplane and kidnapped a senator.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Divide Over Nuclear Plan</HD>
<DH>Defense: The terrorism threat plays against concerns that new
bombing scenarios will make U.S. a rogue nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Several leading Senate Democrats voiced concern Tuesday with a
Pentagon plan that calls for the development of new breeds of nuclear
weapons and an expansion of the list of nations against whom such
warheads might be used.</LD>
<LD>   But as the administration continued to downplay the aggressive tone of
the so-called Nuclear Posture Review, there were also abundant signs that
many lawmakers from both parties are prepared to consider profound
changes to the nation's nuclear contingency plans.</LD>
<LD>   Many Republicans voiced support for the report and argued that its
central goal--the deterrence of strikes against the United States and its
allies--is consistent with the nation's long-standing nuclear policy. "I
do not believe it changes our basic U.S. approach," said Sen. Arlen
Specter (R-Pa.).</LD>
<TE>   And several high-ranking Democrats said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
made them more inclined to back a more aggressive nuclear posture.</TE>
<TE>Changed Environment in Washington</TE>
<TE>   "There are nations and groups adversarial to U.S. interests that have
gotten the mind set that the United States is a paper tiger," said Sen.
Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The
Pentagon's call for new weapons and a wider range of scenarios in which
to use them, he said, "sounds like a step in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Such receptive reactions to a report that many nuclear experts--and
some foreign leaders--have condemned underscores the extent to which the
terrorist attacks have altered the course of defense policy debate in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the last decade, policymakers have largely been
preoccupied with finding ways to reduce the size of the United States'
nuclear arsenal and with persuading other nations to combat the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Tuesday on the Hill, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
stressed that fighting the spread of nuclear weapons remains a paramount
goal. Noting that the number of U.S. nuclear warheads has shrunk by
two-thirds over the last decade, he said, "The philosophy of President
Bush, the philosophy of this administration, is to continue driving down
the number of nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   But the report calls for, among other things, the development of
"low-yield" nuclear weapons that could be used against smaller targets
such as underground bunkers or chemical weapon facilities. The report
also recommends adding such hostile nations as Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
Libya and Syria to the nation's nuclear targeting plans.</TE>
<TE>   Many members of both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), simply withheld judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle noted that the report's urging of the development of more
precise nuclear weapons contradicts earlier signals from the Pentagon.
But he offered no direct criticism of the report itself. "We need more
information before we come to any conclusions," he said.</TE>
<TE>Democrats See Diplomatic Setback</TE>
<TE>   But several prominent Democrats expressed dismay, saying the
Pentagon's proposal would put the United States on a rogue course likely
to erode the nation's diplomatic leverage and encourage other countries
to pursue or expand their own nuclear capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the plan could "reverse the direction of where arms
control has been going for decades," and he vowed to press the White
House for details on the extent to which it intends to pursue the
report's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said the United States risks being labeled "a rogue nation
going off and finding ways to use nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a prospective presidential candidate,
said the report undermines U.S. credibility as it pressures other
countries to resist developing nuclear weapons of their own. "It's very
disturbing. It reduces all our bona fides on the proliferation issue."</TE>
<TE>   Though the White House has a significant amount of discretion in
formulating nuclear contingency plans, several key elements of the report
would require cooperation from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The administration can modify existing weapon platforms, a Democratic
leadership aide said, but would need approval from Congress to develop
new varieties of weapons under the terms of a 1994 statute.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, Congress controls the Pentagon's purse strings. Asked
what leverage lawmakers have on administration nuclear policy, Levin
replied: "The leverage is funding."</TE>

<HD>Scandal Shaking Catholicism to Core</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Pedophilia crisis is spreading throughout the church after
a conviction in the Boston archdiocese.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>In the annals of clerical sexual abuse, the January conviction of
defrocked priest John J. Geoghan on a single charge of fondling a boy was
relatively minor. And yet the case has triggered concern and anger across
the country.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by media scrutiny and victims stepping forward, a scandal over
pedophilia in the priesthood is spreading through the Roman Catholic
Church. The crisis is gathering momentum each day and causing fear in the
church that its ancient wall of secrecy may tumble down.</LD>
<LD>   As never before, the Geoghan case documented that church officials
knew all along that child molesters were at work in the priesthood.</LD>
<TE>   The outrage "is at tidal wave proportions," said San Diego
psychiatrist A.W. Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk and an expert
on sexuality in the church. ". . . It is going to hit every major diocese
in the country. And it is not going to stop there. It is going to be
worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   Since January, the Boston archdiocese has given prosecutors the names
of close to 90 priests suspected of child abuse over 40 years. At least
84 other priests in 11 states also have been accused this year of sexual
misconduct with children. Of those, 21 have been removed from active
duty. In Southern California alone, as many as a dozen priests have been
ordered to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for clerical sexual abuse victims say their phones have been
jammed as the scandal spreads daily: to Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nebraska,
New Hampshire--not to mention Ireland, England and Spain. As late as
Friday, a bishop in Palm Beach, Fla., resigned after admitting he
molested a teenager 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Look what this has done," said attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who
represents 118 Geoghan victims. "There is a wide effect to all of this, a
very long-lasting effect."</TE>
<TE>   The potential damage to the church is enormous, from loss of faith to
vast financial settlements. Some Catholics say they are tired of
hypocrisy in their hierarchy; some dioceses say their insurance companies
have bailed out and they are running out of cash. In 20 years, it has
been estimated that the church already has paid out between $600 million
and $1.3 billion to sexual abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to paying victims, the Vatican says each diocese is on
its own. "It's up to each individual bishop to draw up his guidelines,
implement them and pay the bills," according to a U.S. priest who has
worked in the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Vatican quietly classified sexual abuse of minors by
priests as one of several "graver offenses" against church law.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone of Rome made a rare acknowledgment
in a January address on Vatican Radio:</TE>
<TE>   "There have emerged some cases of gravely illicit behavior on the part
of ordained ministers. We know these cases are given emphasis by the
media . . . and therefore provoke more scandal than in the past, when
information about this kind of behavior was considered confidential.
Therefore, the problem of scandal is a problem that worries the church."</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, the nation's fourth-largest archdiocese, spokesman Father
Christopher Coyne admitted late last week that the fast, far-reaching
spread of the crisis caught church officials by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody realized the extent of the problem, not just
here in Boston but in the United States," he said. "Before, we could just
say that each case was an isolated incident."</TE>
<TE>   Money from the church is no longer enough to silence the waves of
victims who are coming forward. Confidentiality agreements have fallen by
the wayside, as victims learned that, instead of being thrown out of the
church, their abusers often were reassigned--in effect given tacit
permission to repeat their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Faulting the Vatican's "moral passivity" on the issue, Jason Berry,
author of a best-seller about clerical pedophilia called "Lead Us Not
Into Temptation," said: "What you are left with is an American hierarchy
riddled with sexual secrecy that is now having to confront a long legal
policy of trying to secure silence with money. This is not the final
stage of the scandal, it is the early midpoint of a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fox, publisher of the National Catholic Reporter--an independent,
liberal Catholic newspaper--likened the problem to a sea monster whose
head just keeps popping up every day, somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to know how involved the Vatican is, but it is involved by
being aloof from the practical responses that are required in crises like
this," said Fox. "There seems to be an attitude in Rome that this too
shall pass."</TE>
<TE>   Sexual abuse in the church went largely ignored until 1984, when
Father Gilbert Gauthe was charged with raping scores of boys in a
Louisiana parish.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, a canon lawyer then working for the Vatican Embassy in
Washington drafted an internal report about pedophilia in the priesthood
called "The Manual." It warned of a growing problem that could escalate
if the church failed to establish a national policy.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-page document later served as evidence against the church in a
series of sexual abuse lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In all 50 states in 1984, the failure to report child sexual abuse was
a felony. But 22 states--among them Massachusetts--exempted clergy.
Cardinal Bernard F. Law was first informed of Geoghan's alleged abuse in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   By 1985, the National Catholic Reporter was writing about millions of
dollars in settlements to families of children molested by priests.
Noting that the problem exacerbated "old suspicions against the Catholic
Church and a celibate clergy," the journal also railed against a national
leadership that had no protocol for the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, local bishops continued to deal with child molestation
charges by insisting on confidentiality clauses in settlements that
ranged from a few thousand dollars to millions.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 1992 trial of Father James Porter in the archdiocese of
Fall River, Mass. In a case that received international attention, more
than 75 adult men and women accused Porter of molesting them as children.
But because of statutes of limitations, which vary from state to state,
he was convicted of abusing 28 children and sentenced to 18 to 20 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Porter trial was rife with shocking details, and if any case
should have enraged the public, "Porter should have done it," said
Roderick MacLeish Jr., the lawyer who represented most of Porter's
victims. "But people were not prepared to accept it."</TE>
<TE>   The church worked hard to portray Porter as an aberration, "and still
after Porter, people thought that was the exception, not the rule," said
MacLeish. In fact, "there were serial pedophiles in the archdiocese of
Boston for so many years. Of course, there is no magic in the water here.
It's everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The Geoghan case, said Sipe, opened the floodgates because "the system
is now cracked open. The focus is no longer on this bad guy who did these
bad things but the system in which he existed, which supported him and
covered up for him and forgave him without assuring that he had
reformed."</TE>
<TE>   As a crucial consequence, said Sipe, "the code of secrecy is being
broken."</TE>
<TE>   Sipe, whose three books include "Sex, Priests and Power," said secrecy
so deeply permeates church hierarchy that, upon ordination, a new
cardinal promises never to reveal anything "which could cause damage or
dishonor to the church."</TE>
<TE>   Although Law has four times postponed a scheduled deposition in the
Geoghan case, prosecutors were able to demonstrate that the now-defrocked
priest's pattern of pedophilia was known to leaders in the diocese. When
a Boston Globe investigative team won a court order in January to obtain
copies of the documents, the lid came off for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston area is more than 50% Catholic, "part of the East Coast
media," an area where "the lights are white-hot and everything is picked
up," said Fox, author of a book titled "Sexuality and Catholicism."</TE>
<TE>   Families were enraged, he said, because "the documents reveal a total
lack of compassion for the victim. The pattern here is treating these
children as inanimate objects."</TE>
<TE>   Disclosures of just how high the cover-up went also heightened the
response, Fox said: "The cardinal is the senior Catholic prelate in the
United States. So you can say, 'Where does the buck stop in this
hierarchical structure?' "</TE>
<TE>   At the Boston archdiocese, Coyne conceded, "what makes people crazy is
the fact that we knew this guy [Geoghan] had done these things to
children. By any common sense, we should have said, 'We can't put this
guy back into a parish.' "</TE>
<TE>   Many faithful Catholics feel betrayed, Coyne said. "You are dealing
with an institution that is not supposed to be about this stuff. It's
supposed to be about trust and spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   But Patrick McSorley, a 27-year-old electrician, said he has little
trust or spirituality left in his soul. The church was "a safe haven for
pedophiles" when he was molested by Geoghan at age 12, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be fully satisfied," he said, "until I know they're all
gone."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>In one of the biggest such settlements on record, the Archdiocese
of Boston has agreed to pay up to $30 million to 86 people who accused
now-defrocked priest John J. Geoghan of child molestation.</LD>
<LD>   "Accepting this money is not going to end the turmoil in their lives,"
said plaintiffs' attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who announced the
settlement at a news conference Tuesday. "They are not going to be buying
yachts and floating around the Bahamas. There's tremendous pain here."</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, which was reached Monday night, the victims and
their families will receive a total of $15 million to $30 million,
Garabedian said.</LD>
<TE>   "This settlement is an important step in reaching closure for these
victims who have long endured the damage done to them by John Geoghan,"
Cardinal Bernard F. Law said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese already has paid an estimated $15 million to 40 of
Geoghan's victims since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other settlements reached by the church in child
molestation cases, this one is not covered by a confidentiality clause.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan has been accused by more than 130 people of molesting them. He
is serving a nine- to 10-year prison sentence for groping a 10-year-old
boy in a swimming pool and faces another criminal trial in a case
involving a youngster.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs include 70 victims and 16 parents. The exact amounts
that most of the 86 will receive will be determined by arbitrators, based
on the harm each person suffered.</TE>

<LD>The remains of 11 firefighters and two civilians were pulled from
the rubble of the World Trade Center site in New York City as workers
continued in the last stages of the recovery effort, firefighters said.</LD>
<LD>   As of last week, 148 firefighters' bodies had been found and
positively identified through DNA testing--fewer than half of the 343 who
were killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, said Fire Department spokesman Pat
Cleary.</LD>

<LD>The Tarrant County medical examiner in Fort Worth said that a
homeless man who was struck by a car and lodged in the windshield
probably only lived for a few hours with a nearly amputated leg--not a
few days, as police had estimated.</LD>
<LD>   Police had said Gregory Glenn Biggs, 37, probably died two or three
days after his head was trapped in the windshield during the hit-and-run
accident.</LD>
<LD>   Chante J. Mallard, a 25-year-old nurse's aide, told police she hit a
man Oct. 26, then ignored his cries for help as she drove home with him
stuck to her car, according to an affidavit.</LD>

<HD>Priest Dies in N.Y. Church Shooting</HD>
<DH>Crime: An elderly parishioner is also killed. A suspect is arrested
after a seven-hour standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LYNBROOK, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>A man with a rifle opened fire Tuesday in a church in this suburban
community, slaying a priest during Mass as he stood on the altar and
killing an elderly parishioner as she worshiped in a pew.</LD>
<LD>   The suspected gunman fled into a house near Our Lady of Peace Church.
After a seven-hour standoff, a police SWAT team forced its way into the
building and subdued the man, who officers said lunged at them with a
knife.</LD>
<LD>   Father Lawrence Penzes, 50, was shot in the back just as he finished
his sermon and had turned to sit down. The bullet that killed Eileen
Tosner, 73, hit her in the face.</LD>
<TE>   About 40 people were attending the morning Mass when the attack began.
Worshipers who dived to the floor recalled hearing shots and a baby cry.
Some thought they were hearing firecrackers until they realized that
bullets were being fired.</TE>
<TE>   "I just threw myself on the floor. I saw Father Larry go down," said
Jean Maier, who was in a front row. " . . . When I finally got up, the
lady behind me was dead."</TE>
<TE>Clergyman Probably Died on the Altar</TE>
<TE>   Physicians said the clergyman was killed when the bullet that entered
his back pierced his heart.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very likely he died on the altar," said Dr. Dana Monaco, an
attending physician at nearby Mercy Medical Center, where the priest was
pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   Shock waves quickly swept through the normally quiet community on Long
Island's south shore. Parishioners in tears gathered outside the red
brick and gray concrete church, which was cordoned off by yellow police
tape.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious parents rushed to the church's school next door. As a
precaution, the school's doors were locked to keep students inside while
police sought to capture the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Peter Troy, 34, of Lynbrook, was charged Tuesday night
with two counts of second-degree murder and attempted murder, said Nassau
County police spokeswoman Joan Eames.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the man had moved into the area several months ago and
had acted strangely.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are investigating whether the suspected gunman could be
linked to an incident Monday night in the parking lot of the town hall
directly across from the church. Several windows of the car belonging to
Lynbrook's police chief were shattered by gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   After the slayings, detectives said, an off-duty police lieutenant and
a parishioner chased the suspected assailant, who fled the church. They
managed to wrestle the rifle away from him, but he eluded their grasp.
Police quickly traced the man to a nearby house with several apartments,
where he was later apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   "The sorrow we all share at this senseless act is beyond human
measure," said Bishop William Murphy of the Rockville Center diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hearts are one with all the parishioners of Our Lady of Peace
Church who have lost their good and faithful pastor as well as a devoted
parishioner and neighbor," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said Penzes, who was born in Brooklyn, was ordained
in 1972 and had been pastor at Our Lady of Peace since 1994. The church
has about 7,500 worshipers.</TE>
<TE>   Penzes was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force chaplains' corps and
was an activist priest who brought many improvements to the church,
including strengthening its finances.</TE>
<TE>'He Always Left You With a Phrase'</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners described Penzes as a quiet but dynamic priest who
concentrated on the physical and the spiritual needs of his parish.</TE>
<TE>   "It needed new windows, it got new roofing. He made the church look
like it would last another 50 years until the next generation," said John
Lucas, 70. "He was very good on homilies, very story-like. He would hold
your mind to his thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, you walked away with something," Lucas said. "He always
left you with a phrase in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Another parishioner, Russell Ruvolo, 80, described Penzes as "a very,
very good priest, quiet on the outside."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very respectable man," said Ruvolo, who stood in front of
the church watching police enter. "Nobody could hate him, but somebody
did."</TE>
<TE>   Edward Hughes, the custodian of the church's school, said Penzes would
drop into the school to talk with children and was "loved by his
parishioners."</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. James P. Kelly of St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Center said
Penzes had served in two other Long Island churches before coming to
Lynbrook and had a major influence on the parish.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Guerrero, who stood down the block from the church, which she
attended regularly, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a gentleman. He was one of the best priests I ever met," she
said. "He was a beautiful person. Everyone just loved him."</TE>

<HD>Tougher Fuel Rules Faltering in Senate</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Measure up for a vote faces trouble. The favored plan
in the search for a sweeping energy bill is more friendly to the
industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senate efforts to establish tougher fuel-economy standards for SUVs
and other vehicles sputtered Tuesday as lawmakers appeared headed toward
approving an industry-backed plan that critics say would produce little,
if any, gas savings.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, likely to be voted on today, would let the Department of
Transportation set the miles-per-gallon rules. Supporters say that would
allow science, rather than politics, determine the standards. But critics
charge that it would leave the decision to an agency susceptible to
pressure from Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading advocate of tougher standards,
said the alternative "basically does nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Opponents of the tougher standards, led by Democratic and Republican
lawmakers from vehicle-manufacturing states, expressed confidence that
they had the votes to pass their measure.</TE>
<TE>   The vote would represent a major defeat for environmentalists who have
sought to include tougher standards in a comprehensive energy bill now
being debated in the Senate. Instituting such standards, they say, is the
single most important step that lawmakers could take to cut U.S.
dependence on foreign oil and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide--a gas
linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate is handing our nation's energy security over to the auto
industry," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents contended that the tougher standards would force everyone
from farmers to soccer moms into smaller, lighter and less safe vehicles
that they don't want and that the move would cost the U.S. auto industry
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to tell a mom and dad in my home state they can't get
the SUV they want because Congress decided that would be a bad choice,"
said Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.). He predicted that if the tougher
rules went into effect, "we're going to be driving lots of golf carts."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a leading proponent of the tougher
standards, accused critics of scare tactics and of ignoring the national
security interests of reducing oil imports.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in America will have to drive a smaller car," Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate raged, senators' own SUVs filled the parking lot outside
the Capitol, a testament to the political difficulty of legislating
something as popular as the SUV.</TE>
<TE>   The fuel standard issue touched off the fiercest lobbying on the
energy legislation and underscored how energy policy is often shaped--not
solely by partisan differences but by home-state interests.</TE>
<TE>   Senators opened their debate Tuesday on the fuel-economy standards
after delaying a vote on one of the first Enron-inspired reforms--a
proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to bring the kind of energy
derivatives traded by Enron under greater government oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, McCain and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) have sought to
raise the standards for passenger vehicles to 36 mpg by 2015, the biggest
increase since the fuel-economy program was established in 1975 after the
Arab oil embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Car makers now must meet a "corporate average fuel economy," or CAFE,
standard of 27.5 mpg for cars and 20.7 mpg for light trucks--a category
that includes SUVs, minivans and pickups.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Bond pushed the alternative, which also
would direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set
standards based on such factors as how the tougher rules would affect
U.S. dependence on foreign oil, vehicle safety and auto industry jobs.
Their measure also calls for more generous tax incentives to encourage
consumers to buy fuel-efficient cars and more government funding for
research into fuel-efficient vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), whose state includes auto
manufacturing plants, said she supports the Levin-Bond measure. "I
believe in energy conservation, but I also believe in job conservation."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry disputed contentions that tougher standards would compromise
safety or hurt industry jobs.</TE>

<DL>JACKSON, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>Ignoring pleas from Britain, Georgia executed a dual
British-American citizen Tuesday night for raping and murdering a woman
17 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Before he was given a lethal injection, Tracy Lee Housel apologized
and told his friends and family, "Take care of yourselves. May God be
with you all."</LD>
<LD>   Housel, who was born in the British territory of Bermuda, admitted
picking up Jean Drew, 46, at an Atlanta truck stop in 1985, then raping
her and beating her to death.</LD>
<TE>   During his sentencing hearing, Housel also admitted beating a Texas
truck driver to death and stabbing an Iowa man.</TE>
<TE>   The execution drew intense media interest in Britain, which does not
have capital punishment. British Prime Minister Tony Blair had asked
Georgia's parole board to commute Housel's sentence to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Law Society, representing lawyers in England and Wales, also wrote
to the parole board, and members of the British Parliament called for
Housel's sentence to be commuted.</TE>
<TE>   Housel's lawyers argued that his first trial was unfair and his
court-appointed attorney inexperienced.</TE>

<HD>With Script Revised, Arts Backers Seek U.S. Funds</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>On leave from movie making and music recording for a two-day trip
to Washington, Hollywood actors and musicians headlined a congressional
breakfast Tuesday to push for increased federal funding for the arts and
art education.</LD>
<LD>   Actors William Baldwin, who is president of the nonprofit Creative
Coalition, and Hector Elizondo, rapper Chuck D and other artists spoke
with lawmakers about the importance of the arts to all Americans--and how
Sept. 11 underscored the power of the arts to heal.</LD>
<LD>   The visit was part of Arts Advocacy Day, hosted by Americans for the
Arts, an umbrella group of organizations that works to increase the
visibility of the arts. The organization also recognized Rep. Stephen
Horn (R-Long Beach) with its Government in the Arts Award for his role in
saving the National Endowment for the Arts from elimination.</LD>
<TE>   Horn, along with Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter (D-N.Y.), chairs the
bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus. Horn, who is retiring at the end of
the year, also helped lead the congressional effort that increased
funding for the NEA by $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   "He will leave a legacy that included nothing less than the
preservation of America's federal cultural agencies and broadened access
to the arts and humanities for every American," said Robert Lynch,
president of Americans for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Hollywood delegation noted that the atmosphere in
Congress had changed significantly from the days when NEA funding was
endangered by some conservative lawmakers who objected to art they said
was obscene or sacrilegious.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very successful the past few years in reversing a climate
that was not favorable to the arts," Baldwin said.</TE>
<TE>   The groups said they were encouraged by the Bush administration's 2003
budget. Despite constraints, Bush has requested a $117-million
appropriation for the NEA in his 2003 budget, compared to $115 million
approved by Congress last fiscal year, according to NEA figures.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said it is the responsibility of those in the entertainment
industry to use their access to the media and Congress to benefit the
arts.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in sort of a celebrity-crazed culture," he said. "Our mantra
is to use the voice given to us."</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Chuck D said the artists hope to convince Congress to help make
art education part of the core curriculum in public schools, on a par
with academics. More children, he said, need to know that art is not
simply the popular culture sold by corporations to meet their bottom
line.</TE>
<TE>   "If [kids] know about the arts and are introduced to them at a young
age, they can then basically deal all over the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The groups also cited research compiled by Americans for the Arts
indicating that art instruction is linked to increased academic
achievement and decreased criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrities said the federal government's involvement, while a
small portion of overall arts funding in the country, is necessary
because it provides leadership and stimulates growth in the arts
industry.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the celebrities spoke of the continuing need to bring
the country together after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Artistic expression helped heal communities," Elizondo said. "Can you
imagine where we would be without it?"</TE>

<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Six months after two terrorists died in the World Trade Center
attack, the Florida flight school where they trained has received their
student visa approval forms from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.</LD>
<LD>   Huffman Aviation received the paperwork Monday acknowledging the INS
approvals for Mohamed Atta, 33, of Egypt, and Marwan Al-Shehhi, 23, of
the United Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   Atta and Al-Shehhi trained at Huffman in Venice, Fla., in 2000 and
early 2001, and were aboard the separate flights that struck the World
Trade Center towers.</LD>
<TE>   The two initially entered the United States on visitor's visas but
applied for M-1 student visas, given to immigrants attending technical
schools in the U.S. Foreign students are generally allowed to study in
the United States as long as they apply for student visas, said Russ
Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration service.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Reveals Color-Coded Terror Warnings</HD>
<DH>Safety: The nation is now on yellow, the third of five alert
levels. It means there is a significant risk of attack without word of a
specific target.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The government unveiled a new color-coded alert system Tuesday that
officials hope will remove some of the confusion about the severity of a
terrorist threat.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Ridge, director of the White House Office of Homeland Security,
said the system of "graduated threat assessments" should provide the
public with clearer warnings about the danger of possible terrorist acts.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, the administration has struggled with how to give
citizens terrorism warnings that were more than just confusing, such as
last fall's advisory that terrorists might attack the Golden Gate and
other California bridges.</LD>
<TE>   The new color-coded warning system attempts to grade a terrorism
threat in much the same way that weather forecasters warn of storms, but
officials acknowledged their terrorist alerts will be far less
scientific.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis called Ridge's proposal "a practical,
common-sense approach that will keep the federal government, state
government and local law enforcement all on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   The nation is currently on yellow, or elevated alert, the third of
five security levels, meaning there is a significant risk of attack
without word of a specific target. What is left unclear is how citizens
should respond to such threats.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said the program was designed to motivate local and state
governments to develop plans that will guide the actions of residents.
But he added that "there is no prescription we can write out and give to
our communities."</TE>
<TE>   Community response will be determined at the local level, officials
said, but the new system will give the public a better appreciation of
the degree of the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of local law enforcement and public safety agencies were
being notified Tuesday about the system and why the country is on yellow
alert. Ridge said the Al Qaeda terrorist network is trying to reorganize
after defeats in Afghanistan and has trained thousands of devotees, some
of whom have likely slipped into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new plan, orange signifies a higher risk of attack, calling
for added precautions at public events and specific coordination with
military units or law enforcement agencies. The highest alert, red,
designates the most severe threat and requires such measures as the
closing of government and public facilities and assignment of emergency
response teams.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest category, green, and next-lowest, blue, designate a low or
general risk of attack requiring only that protective measures be
available and emergency teams are trained, officials explained.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said that "from the president's
point of view, it will be quite a while until the United States can get
down to the lowest level."</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be an issue that the United States is going to
wrestle with for quite some time--so long as there are terrorists who
still have a desire to strike us."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said that he has conferred with local officials around the
country in developing the new system and that his office will receive
comments over the next 45 days on how to improve it while it is in place.
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft will be responsible for implementing and
managing the system, according to a White House directive signed by
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Following the 45-day comment period, Ridge and Ashcroft will have 90
more days to refine the system before reporting to Bush on its
effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Ashcroft will be responsible for assessing all threats
and communicating the gravity of them to local and state law enforcement
agencies and to the public. Some sensitive information may be kept from
the public if it is necessary to make arrests, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge's staff said threats will be graded based on such questions as,
"How credible is the information we have received? Has it been
corroborated? How specific is it?"</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of reports are received daily that lack the credibility
needed for an alert to be issued, staff members said.</TE>
<TE>   They declined to give examples of how they would have color-coded past
terrorism alerts, such as a vague warning about danger to California
bridges and the possibility that other airline passengers might have
bombs concealed in their shoes after the arrest of one such traveler late
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the system is a "very good beginning" and took a measure of
credit, noting that he and his security advisor, George Vinson, suggested
a tiered warning system during a trip to Washington in December.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have one goal: that nothing happens to America, that no more
Americans are hurt, much less killed," Davis said. "We're not looking to
make a good case in court after a terror incident. We're looking to
prevent the incident from occurring in the first place."</TE>

of Homeland Security, with recommended government and private-sector

<HD>'Give Something Back,' Bush Tells Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>It was a setting eerily similar to the one Sept. 11, when President
Bush sat before a gaggle of children to better display his warm and fuzzy
side.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time no aide interrupted by whispering to the commander in
chief: "America is under attack."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, during a brief visit to Philadelphia on Tuesday to promote
his volunteerism program, Bush found himself singing and gesturing his
way through "Eensy Weensy Spider" with nine toddlers perched on their
mothers' laps at a shelter for women and children.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah. One of my favorites," the president said softly, as Khalil
Shearlds, head teacher of the People's Emergency Center, announced the
tune.</TE>
<TE>   Bush then joined in, albeit with somewhat less gusto than the rest of
the gang.</TE>
<TE>   He later addressed a gathering of volunteers at the Kimmel Center for
the Performing Arts and participated in a talk about good deeds.</TE>
<TE>   By helping others, both domestically and around the world, Bush said,
Americans will not only demonstrate their goodness but also "win hearts
and souls and minds" in the Muslim world, a world filled with people who,
he added, "don't understand that we share the same values."</TE>
<TE>   Bush launched the USA Freedom Corps in his State of the Union speech
in January as a way to foster volunteerism. At the same time, the
president challenged Americans to give at least two years of their
lives--the equivalent of 4,000 hours--to the service of others.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the program's Web site has been visited more than 6.5
million times, and tens of thousands of Americans have expressed an
interest in answering the president's call, according to John Bridgeland,
director of USA Freedom Corps. The program serves as the umbrella group
for the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps, all existing agencies,
and the new Citizen Corps, which Bush created to give citizens a more
direct role in domestic security.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Citizen Corps, the Department of Health and Human Services
is developing medical reserve teams that could respond to terrorist
attacks, and the Justice Department is helping form "operation tips," a
type of super-neighborhood watch program that would, among other things,
encourage transportation workers--such as truckers, letter carriers and
ship captains--to report suspicious activities through a toll-free
hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeland, in a briefing to reporters, said 18,000 people have
requested applications to join the Peace Corps, a 54% increase over the
same period a year earlier; applications to Ameri-Corps are up by nearly
half; calls to the Senior Corps' toll-free number are up nearly 200% and
almost 20,000 people have signed up to participate in Citizen Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Citing some of the same statistics, Bush told his audience in
Philadelphia: "In other words, Americans have been asked to respond, and
they are."</TE>
<TE>   He also portrayed doing good as a direct, civilian response that
matches the military effort in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe out of this evil will come incredible good," he said. " . .
. If you're interested in fighting evil, love a neighbor. If you're
interested in doing something for your country, help somebody in need;
write a check, give your time, volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that in order to live in a free society, you need to give
something back. All of us owe something to America. And one way to
provide that is either through the military or through loving somebody
and showing it through actual deeds. . . . It is a part of a complete
life."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's visit to Pennsylvania was his 10th since the disputed 2000
presidential election. Pennsylvania is a key battleground state in most
presidential elections; in 2000, it narrowly went to Democrat Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Washington, he attended an evening fund-raiser
expected to bring in $400,000 for the political action committee headed
by House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Wins Democrat Nomination for Texas Governor in a Latino
First</HD>
<DH>Politics: Businessman defeats another Mexican American for the
historic bid. The Senate race has no clear winner to vie for Phil Gramm's
seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Businessman Tony Sanchez won the Democratic primary for governor in
Texas on Tuesday, making history as the first Latino nominated for the
state's highest office by a major party.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, who spent heavily from his personal fortune, easily defeated
his main opponent, former state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales, and two
non-Latino candidates.</LD>
<LD>   With 65% of precincts reporting, Sanchez had 429,382 votes, or 59%.
Morales had 247,594, or 34%.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez now will face Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who succeeded to the
governorship when George W. Bush left Texas to become president.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great privilege to be entrusted with your hopes and dreams as
we chart a new course for the new century," Sanchez told jubilant
supporters at an Austin hotel. The father of four added: "If my boys
wouldn't tease me, I might start crying."</TE>
<TE>   Texas experts generally give Perry a slight edge in the November
election. But with Sanchez on the ballot, most expect a competitive
general election campaign, given his ability to bankroll an aggressive
campaign and his strong appeal to Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "I would make Perry the favorite in this race, but not by much," said
Richard Murray, a political scientist and pollster at the University of
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Democrats also voted on their nominee to face Republican state
Atty. Gen. John Cornyn for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by
Republican Phil Gramm. Cornyn faced only token opposition in the GOP
primary.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic race was a nail-biter, and it appeared no outright
winner would emerge. The top three contenders were Ron Kirk, the African
American former mayor of Dallas; Latino schoolteacher Victor Morales, the
party's low-budget 1996 nominee against Gramm; and Rep. Ken Bentsen, the
nephew of former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   With about half the state's precincts reporting, Victor Morales and
Kirk each had 32%, while Bentsen had 28%. With none of the trio likely to
end up with more than 50% of the vote, the two top finishers are to meet
in a runoff April 9.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk was the favorite of many party leaders before the race began. But
some believe he failed to perform up to expectations during the campaign,
while Bentsen ran better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Cornyn is favored against whoever wins, in part because his Democratic
foe won't have as much money to spend as Sanchez, who is funding his
gubernatorial campaign largely from a family fortune estimated at $600
million.</TE>
<TE>   In the primary, Sanchez spent more than $2 million a week, mostly on
television ads. It's likely his total for the contest exceeded $20
million and approached the most ever spent in a Texas gubernatorial race
here through the general election and primary combined. Dan Morales had
spent only $561,000 through March 1, the latest date for which figures
are available.</TE>
<TE>   The contest between two viable Latino candidates symbolized the
growing importance of Mexican American voters in Texas, particularly to
the Democratic Party. Despite inroads by Bush as governor, most Texas
Latinos still vote Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos constitute about one-third of the population in both Texas and
California. But Texas Democrats are much more dependent on Latino votes
than their California counterparts because white voters in the Lone Star
State vote more heavily Republican. As a result, to win statewide races
in Texas, Democrats usually need Latinos to constitute a larger share of
the overall electorate than in California.</TE>
<TE>   "In Texas, you don't have the labor presence and environmental
[issues] that make white people vote Democrat [as in California]," says
Antonio Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a
think tank that studies Latino politics. "So in Texas you have to rely
more on Latino votes to win."</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gonzalez said, Democrats can routinely win if Latinos
constitute 15% of the statewide vote. In Texas, he calculates, Democrats
need to push the Latino share of the vote to as high as 20%--the goal the
party has established for this fall. That would require the highest
Latino turnout ever in a Texas gubernatorial election.</TE>
<TE>   The race between Sanchez and Dan Morales was unexpectedly bitter.
Morales relentlessly attacked Sanchez over his business dealings,
particularly the failure of a family-owned savings and loan in the 1980s.
Sanchez fired back with ads noting that a federal grand jury was
investigating Morales for his role in steering to a friend several
hundred million dollars in consulting fees from the settlement of a state
lawsuit against the tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the campaign's final days, the candidates clashed sharply over the
proper role of the Spanish language in Texas life. After agreeing to
debate Sanchez once in Spanish and once in English, Morales denounced the
Spanish-only debate and accused his rival of trying to divide the state
"by race, by ethnicity and by language." Sanchez said that debating in
Spanish was an appropriate way to bring "more people into the [political]
process."</TE>
<TE>   A final round of accusations surfaced Tuesday. Morales' campaign
reacted angrily when party officials abruptly closed about 50 of 325
polling places in the San Antonio area after a number of election judges
informed the party Monday night they could not monitor the sites.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Moore, Morales' communications director, complained that most of
the closed sites were on the west side of San Antonio, where Morales was
born. He said many voters directed to new sites were unable to vote
because voting lists from their original precinct had not been
transferred. "It just reeks of typical South Texas politics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Morales won a court order Tuesday afternoon to extend the voting hours
in the San Antonio area by three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Gabe Quintanilla, the local Democratic chairman, acknowledged that the
closings had created substantial confusion. But Quintanilla, who is
neutral in the race, said he didn't believe the last-minute withdrawal of
so many election judges was intended to favor Sanchez. "I don't know why
the stars were all aligned this way, but there was nothing sinister about
this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Sanchez as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, the general
election is certain to be a stiff challenge for the the party.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez is a work in progress as a campaigner; he's a modest presence
on stage, and he's offered few details on his policy agenda.</TE>
<TE>   And though Morales raised pointed accusations against Sanchez, the
former attorney general lacked the funds to air the charges on
television--a problem Perry won't have.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts note, Sanchez emerged from the race with a relatively
centrist image (he has said taxes will be a last resort for closing the
state's impending budget deficit) and a demonstrated willingness to spend
whatever it may take to be competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Florida, Arizona and New Mexico have previously elected Latino
governors.</TE>

<HD>How Man Got Cyanide Puzzles Authorities</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Authorities tried Tuesday to determine how a man who called himself
"Dr. Chaos" obtained cyanide and stashed it in a closet of the city's
mass transit system, locking it to protect the potentially lethal
chemical.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Konopka, 25, was in federal custody, charged with possession of
a chemical weapon. Investigators in Wisconsin, where he is charged in a
five-county rampage of vandalism, said Konopka was an anarchist who had
the "propensity to commit mass destruction."</LD>
<LD>   While no one was hurt, some security experts say Konopka's ability to
stockpile deadly chemicals and get his hands on keys to subway passages
makes the danger clear.</LD>
<TE>   "You get some lone nut out there, whether they are passing cyanide
around or botulism or any . . . harmful bacteria, as long as they are not
contacting anybody, that is going to be hard to find," said former FBI
agent Dick Skilling, now a consultant for a Chicago-area security
company.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents said they found almost a pound of sodium cyanide and 4
ounces of potassium cyanide in a storage room under Chicago's downtown
Loop district, a block from the federal courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Freeman, a chemistry professor at the University of
Illinois-Chicago, said cyanide is "fairly common" and could be ordered
from dozens of chemical supply houses around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing the quantity of cyanide found in the subway with acid would
create "a very big puff" of toxic gas, Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The subway would probably be safe because it's so ventilated, but
released in a confined space with a lot of people, it could be
disastrous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Sgt. Teri Vogel of Door County, Wis., said Konopka was
charged with vandalism in four counties and convicted of disorderly
conduct in a fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Konopka had been living in the Chicago subways for months since
jumping bail in Wisconsin, officials said. His grandmother, Marian
Konopka, 76, said that he left the community of De Pere where he grew up
because he feared he would be imprisoned for 10 years.</TE>

<LD>A Changed America--Extraneous wording appeared in an early edition
of a Sunday story about how Sept. 11 has affected civil liberties. The
affected paragraph should have read: Since Sept. 11, the federal
government has approved secret military tribunals for accused terrorists,
given law enforcement unprecedented powers to tap phones and read e-mail,
and helped foster an atmosphere of self-censorship summed up shortly
after the attacks by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, who warned
Americans to "watch what they say."</LD>

1970, purchased the textile that was returned to Poland last week by the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, after museum officials discovered that
it was Nazi loot. Loewi operated his gallery, Loewi-Robertson Inc., in
Los Angeles until 1970, when he retired and moved to Munich. A story in

<HD>Drivers Need More Data on Hybrids</HD>
<DH>A J.D. Power survey says many consumers would consider
buying such a vehicle if auto makers would just provide enough
information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study by J.D. Power &amp; Associates finds that, despite car
makers' protests that the market is limited, as many as 60% of
new-car buyers would be willing to consider a gasoline-electric
hybrid vehicle if one were available in the same class of car or
truck they had just purchased.</LD>
<LD>   Those consumers also said they want more information about
hybrids.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, it appears, isn't lack of buyer interest but lack of
knowledge and the auto makers' unwillingness, so far, to get a
variety of hybrids into the market.</LD>
<TE>   That's expected to change soon. Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor
Corp. got the jump on the industry by introducing limited-production
hybrids in the U.S. almost two years ago: the two-seat Honda Insight
coupe and the five-seat Toyota Prius sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Now Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and the Chrysler Group
have promised various types of hybrids in the next few years, and
auto makers in Asia and Europe are expected to follow. Honda, in
fact, has just introduced its second hybrid--a gas-electric version
of the Civic.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Power analyst Thad Malesh, director of the alternative power
technology practice at the Agoura Hills consultancy, said hybrid
sales in the U.S. should approach 500,000 vehicles a year shortly
after mid-decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to see as many as 20 hybrid vehicle models, including
cars, trucks and SUVs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So it's good news for car companies that the Power study found
that 30% of new-car buyers "definitely" would consider a hybrid
gasoline-electric vehicle and that 30% more said a hybrid would be a
"strong consideration."</TE>
<TE>   And respondents to the survey of more than 5,000 recent new-car
buyers said that what they want most is a hybrid option in the same
segment as their current vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all those surveyed selected a mid-size passenger car as
their second choice for a hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   Malesh said that by providing Taurus- and Accord-size hybrids,
auto makers would be opening up a still-strange concept to millions
of mainstream buyers.</TE>
<TE>   How strange? Well, women are much more interested in hybrids than
are men, the survey found, but they say there is not enough
information to help them understand the technology.</TE>
<TE>   Men who said they were interested also demonstrated a lack of
familiarity, often confusing hybrid vehicles with the "small,
expensive, limited-range electric vehicles that they saw or heard
about in the 1990s," Malesh said.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost two years after the launch of the first hybrids in the
United States, nearly half the survey respondents still incorrectly
believe a hybrid vehicle needs to be plugged in to recharge the
battery pack," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A hybrid combines two power plants, usually a gasoline engine and
an electric motor. The electric motor boosts the internal- combustion
engine, allowing use of a much smaller conventional engine than it
takes to move standard versions of the same vehicles. The gas engine
powers a generator that produces electricity for the electric
motor--some is stored in on-board batteries--so it never has to be
plugged in to a stationary charging unit.</TE>
<TE>   In a properly designed hybrid, the performance is similar to that
of the conventional version but with vastly improved fuel economy and
reduced emissions.</TE>
<TE>   But before hitting the market with all the hybrid vehicles it is
promising, the auto industry needs an information campaign to explain
what a hybrid is--and what it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion about hybrid features, such as gasoline engines that
turn off at stoplights and electric motors that serve as
superchargers, highlights the need for educational efforts, Malesh
says.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the heightened interest in hybrids is the publicity that
the inaugural Honda and Toyota efforts have received, as well as
consumers' concerns about the environment, rising fuel prices and
U.S. dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   The J.D. Power survey also found that although price plays a big
part in the hybrid market and that consumers want federal and local
subsidies to help keep costs competitive with those of standard
vehicles, many are willing to pay a premium for hybrid vehicles.</TE>

<DH>Pontiac's much-derided plastic of years past is being
tossed to remake the line with some lean, clean driving machines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp.'s product development czar has given us a
glimpse of where he wants to take GM by unveiling a new design
direction for Pontiac.</LD>
<LD>   Gone is the raked plastic cladding on the sides of the cars--the
stuff that seemed to engulf the hapless Aztek.</LD>
<LD>   At the recent Chicago Auto Show, GM Vice Chairman Robert A. Lutz
showed retooled Sunfire and Bonneville models--cars sans cladding--as
well as a smooth-sided sedan that presages the next-generation Grand
Prix.</LD>
<TE>   The Grand Prix G-Force concept will be the basis for the
production 2004 Grand Prix, scheduled to hit showrooms next year and
one of the first cars tweaked by Lutz since he joined GM in
September.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old Lutz, a former Chrysler Corp. president and chief
executive, said he took one look at the Grand Prix under development
and saw that the trademark double-intake grille was too high, making
the front of the car look as if it were sporting oversized buck
teeth. The car had even been nicknamed Alvin, after the animated
singing chipmunk--but nobody was willing to speak out. Lutz
immediately ordered the grille repositioned.</TE>
<TE>   Lutz says that revitalizing Pontiac and Cadillac are his top
priorities and insists that the process of stripping down the
Pontiacs will reveal a beauty that was there but camouflaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I think cladding was a good way to differentiate Pontiac from
other cars, but when you look at this Bonneville that's been
decladded and smoothed out, it permits the fundamentally gorgeous,
just gorgeous, shape ... to become fully visible, and you're not
distracted by all these other elements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So off came the side ribbing, first with the 2002 Aztek and then
with the 2003 Sunfire.</TE>
<TE>   "We were already starting to move in that direction," said Lynn
Myers, Pontiac's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   But under Lutz, "we accelerated a little bit," she said. "And once
we started down that road, it happened very quickly. It gets us into
the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   It is happening none too soon for many design experts, who have
long castigated GM for wrapping Pontiacs in horizontal striations.</TE>
<TE>   "What in the world were they thinking when they allowed that to
happen?" said Dan Gorrell, vice president of San Diego-based
marketing consultancy Strategic Vision. "It makes the cars look so
cheap and substandard.</TE>
<TE>   "When they look cheap, even if they're not, people are going to
stay away from them. When you have an image problem, you should at
least dress well."</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac has had a mixed past. It was almost eliminated in the
1950s because of poor sales, then saw its heyday in the '60s with the
Grand Prix coupe and the legendary 375-horsepower GTO, one of the
premier muscle cars.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1970s, Pontiac developed a hot Corvette-like two-seater
prototype called the Banshee--put together by the division's chief
engineer, a man with a vision named John Z. DeLorean.</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac has had more consistent styling among its vehicles than
any other GM division--cat's-eye headlights, the double grille, the
ribbed plastic cladding.</TE>
<TE>   Bryon Fitzpatrick, a former auto designer and now chairman of the
industrial design department at the College of Creative Studies in
Detroit, remembers Pontiacs of the 1950s and '60s with a distinct
line of chrome up the center of the hood and down the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Then Pontiacs got soft and became "me-too" GM cars.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed to have sunk into the mire in the last few years,
full of mediocrity. All you had left was the cladding--in plastic,"
Fitzpatrick said. "The good news is they're getting rid of it, and
that's a move in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Acting on Lutz's orders, GM designers in a matter of weeks came up
with the Pontiac Solstice two-seater concept car for the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit in January.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the Solstice roadster and coupe, which is a
redefinition of clean styling--that's where we're going with Pontiac:
a much more international, European direction with very, very clean
surfaces and a very strong front end," Lutz said.</TE>
<TE>   Although GM has not announced a decision to make the Solstice, the
auto maker did release an expected price of $25,000--meaning the
company is seriously considering it to enhance Pontiac's new design
character.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last few years the identity has depended too heavily on
side moldings and looked crude and cheap, not adding to the image GM
wanted," says Geoff Wardle, an automotive design instructor at Art
Center College of Design in Pasadena. "They always looked a bit
toylike."</TE>
<TE>   He said he likes the direction of the latest Pontiac styling
efforts, noting: "Now they look more solid, more refined and just as
sporty."</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac's Vibe, a sport-utility-like station wagon developed with
Toyota Motor Corp. (which sells its version as the Matrix), has just
gone on sale, and Pontiac executives hope it will attract more
youthful buyers to the brand.</TE>
<TE>   Pontiac's next sporty addition, however, could come from an
entirely different source: Australia.</TE>
<TE>   GM is said to be considering importing as many as 20,000 Monaros
to the U.S. from Holden, its Australian brand. They would be badged
here as Pontiacs if the car can be made to meet American safety
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Monaro has a 5.7-liter, 402-horsepower V-8 engine and could
signal a nostalgic rebirth of the GTO marque in today's market.</TE>
<TE>   GM won't confirm anything, but Lutz recently visited Holden's
facilities Down Under and said of the Monaro:</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming affordability, there isn't one guy in the United States
who wouldn't like to have it sooner rather than later."</TE>

<HD>Engine Sludge Failures Blackening Toyota's Reputation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. has carefully crafted the image of its Toyota and
Lexus vehicles in the U.S. market, appealing to customers who expect
their cars to deliver unparalleled quality and reliability.</LD>
<LD>   But engine sludge seems to be blackening this pristine picture.</LD>
<LD>   Internet sites are abuzz with allegations about failures of Toyota
engines because of crankcase sludge, formed when oil becomes so
contaminated and worn that it thickens to the consistency of jello.</LD>
<TE>   Although some crankcase contamination is normal in most engines,
severe sludge will starve lubrication to bearings, sleeves, bushings
and pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota representatives say the problem is owner neglect and abuse,
though customers are insisting that they changed their oil regularly
and that the Toyota engines either must have defects that cause the
formation of the sludge or are simply less tolerant of sludge.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota acknowledges that it has received reports of 3,000 engine
failures and problems but says no defects in its products are
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   When Milwaukee investment broker Mike Reed bought his 1999 Lexus
RX 300, it was his second Toyota product. But for the last three
weeks, the Lexus has been at a dealership with a dead engine. Reed
said he followed the instructions in his owner's manual that advised
oil changes every 7,500 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for Reed was that his local Lexus dealer wanted
$16,000 to replace the 3.0-liter V-6 engine--an engine similar to
that in the Toyota Camry.</TE>
<TE>   After some haggling, Toyota agreed to replace the RX 300 engine
for $8,000, still a pricey proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports of engine failures on such top-selling models as
the Camry and the Sienna minivan, Toyota says there are no defects in
design or workmanship.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't change the oil in an engine, it doesn't matter whose
engine it is," said Toyota spokesman Mike Michels. "If you run it
20,000 or 30,000 miles without an oil change, the likelihood of an
engine failure is pretty strong. It is an issue of maintenance."</TE>
<TE>   But many owners say they are astounded by the company's insistence
that they have abused their vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Why, they wonder, would Toyota owners be more inclined to abuse
their cars than owners of Hondas, BMWs or Buicks that don't have
known engine problems?</TE>
<TE>   "Toyota is jerking around its customers big time," said Robin
Burpee, who lost the engine in her Sienna after 30,000 miles. Toyota
disputed her warranty claim but eventually agreed to replace the
engine just days before an arbitration hearing. Burpee says her
husband performed the oil changes, as he has on prior Toyotas the
couple owned.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's reputation has taken some uncharacteristic knocks,
including a negative rating by the Better Business Bureau of the
Southland that covers Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on our standards, we rate this company as having an
unsatisfactory business performance record. Complaints contain a
pattern of allegations concerning warranty and repair issues. Some
customers complained they experienced repeated problems with certain
components, found zone office representatives unwilling to help with
repair costs, or were dissatisfied with extended warranty claims
procedures," the BBB report said.</TE>
<TE>   Michels said the company is "very concerned" about the findings
and is working to clear up a "communication channel" breakdown with
BBB that left a number of consumer complaints unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Toyota issued a new warranty on all its 1996
and newer vehicles equipped with the 3.0-liter V-6 and 2.2-liter
inline-4 cylinder engines.</TE>
<TE>   Under that new policy, Toyota will repair or replace engines
damaged by sludge, if the owners can prove they changed the oil at
least once a year.</TE>
<TE>   It is mailing notifications of the goodwill policy to 3.3 million
customers who have bought vehicles equipped with those engines. The
letter also emphasizes the importance of oil changes.</TE>
<TE>   Michels cites industry surveys that show car owners change their
oil an average of every 9,000 miles, meaning that many stretch the
change interval above that average. At some point, engine oil loses
its ability to lubricate.</TE>
<TE>   But many engines will tolerate dirty oil in a crankcase and can go
far beyond 10,000 miles on an oil change without triggering a
catastrophic engine failure.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Hudecki, a retired Valvoline oil researcher and among the
best-known lubrication experts in the nation, said sludge--also
called gelation--begins to form about 12,000 to 15,000 miles after an
oil change.</TE>
<TE>   The top-rated oils contain many additives that prolong their life.
Two of the most important types are detergents and dispersants. The
detergents help wash crud and varnish off engine parts, and the
dispersants keep the dirt suspended in the oil.</TE>
<TE>   "Most oil will last probably between 12,000 and 15,000 miles, even
if it is in a vehicle driven [in the city] by somebody like a cab
driver or police. If you are out on the highway, most oils will last
15,000 miles with no problem," Hudecki said.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the 15,000-mile mark, however, the oil is full of
crud and the dispersants are saturated.</TE>
<TE>   The oil becomes thicker and thicker, a particular problem in cold
areas where water condensation builds up and causes additional
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, modern engines make unprecedented demands on oil. They
produce more power in compact designs than ever before, putting
stress on the oil, said Dick Clark, a lubrication specialist at the
American Petroleum Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Newer engines are like highly bred horses, sometimes neurotic and
badly behaved.</TE>
<TE>   They have overhead camshafts with cylinders served by four or even
six valves. Blocks and heads are made of cast aluminum, rather than
iron, and are more vulnerable to heat damage. Internal temperatures
are sometimes intentionally set high to promote fuel efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Oil in any engine will eventually get dirty and wear out. But some
engines have better piston rings, valve guides and gaskets that keep
contamination out of the crankcase. Some have better crankcase
ventilation systems to remove combustion gases that blow in the
crankcase. And some engines simply handle sludge better than others.</TE>
<TE>   "Are some engines more forgiving to dirty oil? Probably," Clark
said. "I can't say that there is a hard and fast rule that this one
is and this one isn't. Every engine type has its strong points and
weak points."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some Toyota owners worry that they will be the next
victim of sludge. Charlene Blake, a Virginia schoolteacher, said
engine oil analysis on her Toyota found fuel contamination at 32,000
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Michels said Blake has placed thousands of Internet postings about
the company, even though her Toyota engine is fine.</TE>
<TE>   But she retorts: "I have been disillusioned with the quality."</TE>

<HD>Seeking a Hip Audience, Koppel Lets His Hair Down</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a frantic bid to prove that "Nightline" is still viable after ABC
almost replaced it with David Letterman's show, Ted Koppel is
revamping the program to attract a younger, hipper audience. For
example, next week, he'll don an alluring Speedo swimsuit and take
the show to Daytona Beach, Fla., for a "Nightline Special Report:
Spring Break!"</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by ABC News correspondent Jenny McCarthy, he'll
examine foreign policy, tan lines and keggers. "In no way will we
compromise our commitment to journalistic excellence," Koppel
insisted. "When we return from Daytona Beach, we'll have Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former Sen. Alan Simpson and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan debating whether Joey and Rachel should
date on 'Friends.'"</LD>
<LD>   In coming weeks, Koppel will also test several new formats and
themed programs:</LD>
<TE>   * A Martha Stewart Nightline: Koppel teams with America's style
maven as she transforms a dilapidated public housing project by using
pastel colors, Asian throw rugs and decorative wall sconces made from
crack pipes.</TE>
<TE>   * Nightline ER: A one-hour drama based on political surgeries,
including Dick Cheney's heart operation, John McCain's melanoma
treatment, Ronald Reagan's polyp removal and Greta Van Susteren's
face transplant.</TE>
<TE>   * Late Nightline: Attempting to out-Letterman Letterman, Koppel
adds a top 10 list ("the top 10 things overheard in war correspondent
Ashleigh Banfield's dressing room"), a MonkeyCam, Stupid Politician
Tricks (Richard Riordan makes a 30-point lead in the polls vanish
overnight), a house band (Hugh "Puffy" Downs and the Nightline
Orchestra), a studio audience and applause signs. In recurring comedy
segments, Koppel will drop congressmen from a five-story tower, send
his mom to cover the war in Afghanistan and switch toupees with
various celebrities, such as Sam Donaldson.</TE>
<TE>   * Whose Nightline Is It Anyway?: The world's first improv news
program.</TE>
<TE>   * Ted Koppel's Fear Factor: Contestants subject themselves to
terrifying stunts, including eating bugs and listening to Andy Rooney
nonstop for 72 hours.</TE>
<TE>   * MTV's Real World Nightline: Koppel shares a Manhattan apartment
with Henry Kissinger, political consultant James Carville, Barbara
Walters, Rep. Barney Frank, Britney Spears and "comedian" Pauly
Shore.</TE>
<TE>   * Touched by an Anchorman: An exploration of religious faith in
America.</TE>
<TE>   * Nightline Blind Date: Koppel goes out with various foreign
leaders and then rates them as dates. In the first show, he has to
choose between Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and
Norway's King Harald V.</TE>
<TE>   * Nightline Survivor: Members of ABC's news division compete to
see who can last the longest under Disney ownership. In episode 1,
Cokie Roberts is voted off the island after everyone agrees she has
the stupidest name. In episode 2, the islanders construct a thatched
hut from Koppel's hair.</TE>
<TE>   * The Wonderful World of Nightline: In a shameless attempt at
cross-promotion, Koppel hires Disney characters to report on news
from around the globe--Goofy from Afghanistan, Pluto from Europe and
Donald "Peking" Duck from China.</TE>

<HD>Environmentally Friendly, With Enemies</HD>
<DH>Preservationist Richard Leakey can play hardball with
politicians as well as with poachers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Lunchtime in Nairobi. At the airport, boxes packed for safari carry
guns and cameras. As remote as the safari-going culture seems from
the politics of everyday life in Africa, it is a source of income and
a source of stories. It is also, increasingly, a way to protect
Africa's vivid environment. Richard Leakey has spent 40 years
fighting to save Africa's wildlife from poachers and habitat
destruction and has worn many hats along the way. Although he has had
a long career in politics here, in the U.S. Leakey is mostly known
for his many books on human origins--"The Origin of Humankind,"
"Origins Reconsidered," "The Sixth Extinction"--and as a contributing
editor to Discover magazine. Books have been written about his work
as a paleontologist and that of his famous parents, paleontologists
Louis and Mary Leakey, who proved through their many fossil
discoveries, that Africa, and not China, was the cradle of
civilization. (Mary Leakey discovered the first Australopithecus
skull in Kenya.)</LD>
<TE>   At 58, Leakey has a kind of simmering presence. He could get angry
at any moment. He resembles a lion, with a large head and a powerful,
muscular presence. Yet he has difficulty getting up and down and
walking down stairs. Leakey's right leg was amputated after a 1993
airplane crash that many suspect was the result of a political plot.
When asked directly if he thinks there is some truth to this rumor,
he shakes his head. "You can't live your life in fear," he says. "You
don't have to lose your legs to learn that."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, though his anti-poaching campaigns have made headlines
around the world, he has not described his life as a public servant
in print. He served as head of the Kenyan Wildlife Service from 1989
to 1999 (with two brief interruptions) and then, until August of last
year, for 18 tumultuous months as head of the country's civil
service, during which time he is said to have made many enemies with
his blunt approach while also weathering a difficult relationship
with Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi.</TE>
<TE>   In "Wildlife Wars," his latest book, he weaves the parts together
to tell his story. Ten years in the making and co-written by Leakey
family biographer Virginia Morell, the book is a memoir of Leakey's
shift from looking at bones to managing people, of his efforts to
work within the system to protect Kenya's wildlife. In part, the book
took so long because Leakey was hesitant to point fingers in print
while there was still hope that poaching and other offenses could be
eradicated. Even now, he says, there is another book yet to be
written with more specific information about the sources of
corruption in Kenya's government. "Wildlife Wars" is the story of
Leakey's efforts to understand people, just as he once came to
understand fossils and animals.</TE>
<TE>   Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan. There has been much
speculation about his political career, particularly in the last
decade, but Leakey denies that he has any ambitions politically (much
less for the presidency, which has been rumored). Whatever his
political ambitions or lack thereof, Leakey loves Kenya. "Why would I
ever," he says by way of a greeting when a reporter mentions the
brilliant day, "ever want to leave?" He does not want to see the
country denuded by government or private players. He believes that
Kenya's animal resources are the key to a more prosperous future.
"Wildlife Wars" is his recounting of how he tried to work within the
system--in it, but not of it.</TE>
<TE>   Leakey meets a reporter at a restaurant that is the former home of
author Karen Blixen, a haven surrounded by whistling thorn trees and
yellow-barked acacia in a neighborhood known simply as Karen.
Brilliant blue birds swoop overhead. The working class has been up
for hours, but the Kenyan Cowboys--Nairobi's equivalent of London's
Sloane Rangers--the young, restless, elite whites living in Karen are
still bleary-eyed from last night's parties. There's an election
coming sometime in 2002, but no one, not even the taxi drivers who in
most cities hear everything, know when it will be or who will run.
The capital city of Kenya is commonly called Nairobbery, though most
people here are more afraid of raging traffic than burglars.
Meanwhile, amid the chaos, the London Times and even the Wall Street
Journal have focused more on the salacious story of a 30-year-old
huntress guide, Natasha, under suspicion for killing her lover, a
painter. It is a city of rumors and liaisons. Leakey is both a of
part and separate from this demimonde. Leakey has dedicated his life
to conservation in Africa, to making sure that "it is the basis for
tourism." It's a frustrating goal, he says, because of what he
politely calls "inefficiencies in government." ("Wildlife Wars"
reveals that Leakey is not always so polite, particularly in
boardrooms and in meetings where shady deals are being cut between
poachers and officials.) "In a way," he says, "I was pushed into
people management, but I believe in the malleability, not necessarily
the goodness, of human beings."</TE>
<TE>   He worked from 1963 to 1989 as director of the Natural History
Museum in Nairobi, a post his father had before him. From here he had
access to the president and pursued his conservation efforts from a
position outside the government bureaucracy. In 1989, President Moi
informed Leakey that he would be the new head of the Kenya Wildlife
Service, throwing him into the center of a particularly large and
corrupt bureaucracy. In that capacity, Leakey fought many of his
famous battles to save the then-endangered elephants ( and the lions
from hunters.</TE>
<TE>   One of Leakey's more controversial ideas was the fencing of
national parks. This provoked controversy around the world among
environmentalists and policy wonks over the importance of including
humans in the habitats under debate. Another proposal was a suggested
policy of shooting poachers on sight. Yet another was firing almost
1,600 Wildlife Service employees, perhaps his least popular move as
director of the Wildlife Service. "I ran afoul of the power barons,"
he chuckles over a Tusker, the local beer, in the dark paneled
sitting room of Blixen's estate. People, he says, "who were more
interested in the status quo." He likes elephants more than people,
the press reported at the time.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a wizard of a fund-raiser, including $1.5 million in
the mid-1980s from then Secretary of State James Baker to improve
security in Kenya's national parks (a force of 1,500 armed men) and
$500,000 from a private donor for night surveillance equipment. And
he was also the point man in negotiations for a $150-million aid
package from the World Bank to rebuild the parks. But in May 1990,
the Kenyan government asked him to retract the "code of discipline,"
policy guidelines prohibiting poaching and ensuring severe
punishments against poachers, that his staff had written to protect
the parks. He did not comply, and the well-publicized discovery by a
National Geographic crew of a poachers' cache of 150 bloody tusks put
an end to the discussion, proving that the problem was rampant,
vicious and perhaps most important, unappealing to the rest of the
world. The code stood.</TE>
<TE>   That victory was one of many in which Leakey held his ground. But
by 1992, rumors that he was angling for more power, in fact, for the
presidency, reached Moi. "In politics," Moi told him in a late night
phone call described in "Wildlife Wars," "you must always be careful
who you trust."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the accident. Leakey writes that during his
convalescence, he thought often of a femur his team uncovered in the
early 1970s, from a Homo Erectus boy, around 1.8 million years old.
The leg had been broken, he writes, but the bone had healed, which
meant, contrary to popular opinion, that the boy had not simply been
left to die, but had been tended to and fed until he healed.
"Understanding just how truly helpless one is with one leg gave me a
deeper understanding of how critical our capacity to care for one
another has been to our survival as a species," he wrote. Jorie and
Jeffrey Kent, owners of Abercrombie &amp; Kent, a highly respected
company dedicated to conservation and environmentally intelligent
tourism in Africa, came to Leakey's aid and flew him to London for
care.</TE>
<TE>   On Leakey's return, he was vilified in the press by detractors who
accused him of running the Wildlife Service as if it were "personal
property." In 1994, he resigned, encouraging the World Bank to
reconsider the $130 million it had yet to turn over to Kenya. He
wrote, and has said frequently, that he felt the money would only
encourage greater mismanagement of Kenya's wildlife. A few months
later, he helped to form a new opposition party, not unlike our Green
Party, which was called Safina (a Kiswahili word meaning "ark"). They
hoped to defeat the ruling party, KANU, in the 1997 elections. Moi
won again, but Safina earned five Parliamentary seats, one of which
was held by Leakey. In 1998, Moi asked him to resume the directorship
of the Wildlife Service. After one year in that job, Moi asked him to
leave the service to become secretary to the cabinet, permanent
secretary to the president and head of Kenya's Public Service.
"Wildlife War" ends here.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Leakey's attention is mostly consumed by milder
matters, such as a vineyard from which he has just produced his first
salable issue of wine. "I'm not anticipating a return to public
life," he says when asked if he would ever run for president.
Besides, he adds, acknowledging the importance of black Kenya running
itself, "one could be in for some powerful rhetoric about Europeans
and Colonials. I think I can be more effective in a lower-profile
role," he says. "Corruption is not an impossible challenge."</TE>
<TE>   At least he feels it is not as explicit or rampant as in the
private sector. Leakey is currently looking for private funding to
guarantee Kenya's parks can survive "irrespective of world tourism."
(Forty percent of tourists to the country are Americans, and tourism
to Africa fell by half on Sept. 12, he says.) "We need a mechanism by
which we can evaluate wildlife as a resource, as part of our
heritage, and to ensure its safety." He thinks that an endowment of
$3 million would generate enough interest income to sustain this
plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in the Serengeti," he says. "The African sky at night
is one of the most spectacular things in the world. It's why I went
into politics." This is not hard to understand. Later that night, at
Camp Olanana in the Masai Mara, two hours from Nairobi and one of
Leakey's favorite spots, the stars are in fact more vivid and
brilliant, their animal constellations more evident than their dusty
counterparts in the Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch with friends, Leakey insists that to really see the
stars one must sleep outdoors, in spite of the animals. It slips that
he himself is afraid of the dark. "It's just an excuse not to
socialize," he says, trying to shrug it off. He spies a well-fed
diner at another table who is trying to get Leakey's attention. "You
are spreading rumors," Leakey shouts across a crisp lawn filled with
red-coated waiters carrying trays. "You've started gossip!" The man
splutters and asks for a meeting, but Leakey waves him off.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to argue with people," he insists as he walks away. "And
anyway," he says with a grin, "most people can't argue very long."</TE>

<HD>Seeking a Place in the Faith</HD>
<DH>Congregation uses a documentary to begin a debate on role
of gays in Orthodox Judaism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well past midnight, people were still talking. They'd been together
for about four hours and by now had broken into small groups in
heated conversation, not yet ready to leave behind a dilemma with no
obvious resolution: Can you be gay and an Orthodox Jew?</LD>
<LD>   More than 200 members of the Orthodox B'nai David-Judea
Congregation gathered Saturday in a banquet hall at their Pico
Boulevard synagogue for a special screening of "Trembling Before
G-d," a documentary about the struggle of gay and lesbian Orthodox
Jews. The Bible calls the practice of homosexuality "an abomination,"
and for most Orthodox Jews, that declaration is law. Orthodox
homosexuals have long been told the only way to be true to their
faith is to change, but this film provokes the question of how to
treat someone who is both in the faith and out of the closet.</LD>
<TE>   B'nai David-Judea is a modern Orthodox congregation, a place where
the dress is contemporary, the dialogue rigorous and the questions
often difficult. Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky, leader of the congregation,
organized the evening "to begin a conversation," he said before the
event. "Part of our commitment to religious observance includes
having a proper and appropriate religious interaction with everyone
in our community. We should not think any less of the gays and
lesbians in our congregation; we should not extend to them any less
than we would extend to anyone else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary by Sandi Simcha DuBowski premiered last year at
the Sundance Film Festival and has been shown at synagogues in other
cities. B'nai David-Judea is the first Los Angeles Orthodox
congregation to screen it, and for the occasion, Kanefsky invited
three of the film's subjects--30-year-old Malka and Leah, a lesbian
couple from Miami--and 43-year-old David, who lives in L.A. All three
used only their first names.</TE>
<TE>   Malka and Leah met in high school, fell in love at camp and have
stayed together for 13 years. In the film, Malka talks about how
since she told her parents not long ago about her sexuality, they can
barely speak to her. At B'nai David-Judea, Leah revealed that she
came out to her mother only a week ago and that her mother told her
she'd known, without knowing, for years. The two practice their faith
together at home but have not found a congregation where they feel
comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   David realized he was gay in college and sought counsel from a
rabbi who told him to get therapy to fix the problem. A decade later,
he finally recognized that he couldn't become heterosexual. His
family, he said, has been supportive, but it pains him that they will
not be able to dance at his wedding.</TE>
<TE>   The evening was orchestrated to allow the congregation privacy. No
visitors were allowed in as congregants watched the film, then
discussed it for half an hour. In the lobby outside the hall, Malka,
Leah and David seemed nervous. Malka said she's talked often with
audiences after screenings, but rarely to Orthodox Jews. At one
synagogue screening, the audience was hostile. But when the hall's
doors opened, the three were welcomed with a round of hearty
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Though not all Jewish traditions reject homosexuality, the
Orthodox community has based its condemnation on a literal
interpretation of the Bible. Quoted on-screen with the opening
credits of "Trembling Before G-d," the teachings are not subtle: "A
man who lies with a man as one lies with a woman, they have both done
an abomination," says the book of Leviticus. "They shall be put to
death, their blood is on them." Likewise, "for women to rub against
each other in the position of sexual intercourse is forbidden," says
the Shulchan Aruch, a compendium of Jewish law dating from the 16th
century. "It is fitting for the court to administer lashes for this
transgression."</TE>
<TE>   Such punishments may no longer be administered, but the film shows
that the pain of gays and lesbians, both young and old, has not
abated. Many are rejected by their families as well as by their
religious community. Some try to change--David spent a decade in
therapy, to no avail. Some don't go to such lengths, but all suffer
the anguish of rejection. Many Orthodox gays and lesbians have
committed suicide, the film points out. Many more have left the
religious life.</TE>
<TE>   Kanefsky said he wants his congregation to develop a policy toward
homosexuals, a process that he said will take time and much
discussion. "When it comes to matters of Jewish laws, I am the
authority," he said. "On policy issues, there is a democratic
process."</TE>
<TE>   After the screening, Malka, Leah and David sat together at the
front of the large hall and answered questions. Kanefsky moderated,
gently prodding his audience. "We accept that it is not our purview
to undo the Halakha [Jewish law]," he told the three, summarizing the
group's earlier private discussion. "For the most part--not
everyone--people were extraordinarily touched by the personal pain."</TE>
<TE>   When asked why he doesn't just pray in a non-Orthodox environment
(Reform and some Conservative Jewish congregations have welcomed gays
as members), he replied: "I grew up Orthodox, and I'm most
comfortable in an Orthodox shul [synagogue], why can't I daven [pray]
where I want to daven?" he asked. "I'm just a regular Jewish guy that
happens to be gay, and I'm probably not the only gay man in this
room.</TE>
<TE>   Leah added, "If I didn't have Shabbos [the Sabbath], I would work
seven days a week. It's like taking away my breath; how could I
live?"</TE>
<TE>   There were no easy answers to such questions, only more questions.
But, as Kanefsky explained, raising difficult questions is a part of
the practice of the faith. "This is the most serious way of living
Torah," the rabbi said. "It is a much deeper orthodoxy when it is an
orthodoxy that really engages."</TE>
<TE>   After a final word from Kanefsky, congregants continued their
conversation in smaller groups.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very courageous man," Rae Drazin said of the rabbi. "This
is something that most mainstream Orthodox would not be eager to do."</TE>
<TE>   Abigail Yasgur had seen the film twice before yet came again to
see it to engage with her congregation. "It approached Orthodoxy with
integrity," she said. "There were differences between the members [of
the congregation], including some homophobic reactions. But we have
much to gain from being sensitive and embracing brothers and sisters
who are gay. I think this film is telling Orthodox leadership that
they need to be mindful of humanity when interpreting the Torah."</TE>
<TE>   A woman with two grown daughters who identified herself only as
Lily said the film did little to change her views and only made her
sad. "When you get old and you don't have so much feeling for each
other, what will you see in your life?" she said. "No children?"</TE>
<TE>   A man who asked that his name not be used said the film gave him
understanding. "The movie helped me distinguish between gay
subcultures--if you stroll down Melrose, you're exposed to a specific
subculture, which is not what I would want in my shul," he said. But
he draws the line at gay marriage and open displays of affection.
"Would it bother me if they walked in hand in hand?" he asked. "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   As the hour grew late, Kanefsky stood off to the side, surrounded
by a dozen congregants. He described a point of consensus--that the
law should not change, even as people become more open. "It was quite
clear that the premise that the Halakha is what it is was soundly
embraced," he said. "That was not brought up for debate." But, he
said, he hopes "Trembling Before G-d" will continue to stimulate
discussion in the Orthodox community. "I would love for Orthodox
rabbis to come together" to discuss the issue of how to relate to
homosexuals, he said. Ultimately, each congregation will have to
decide what path to take, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my gut, I have a deep feeling that the ultimate resolution
will not be satisfactory to those in our congregation who are seeking
complete equality," he said. "But it will be a whole lot better than
what happens in the absence of a policy."</TE>
<TE>   Kanefsky paused.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope. I pray."</TE>

<LD>"Do you smoke?," a member of the audience at the Lee Strasberg
Theatre Institute asked Sissy Spacek.</LD>
<LD>   She demurred.</LD>
<LD>   "I was smoking those herbal cigarettes," she said of her
chain-smoking "In the Bedroom" role. "Not the good ones," she added
to laughter from the audience.</LD>
<TE>   Following a screening of the movie, which is nominated for five
Academy Awards, Spacek and director Todd Field fielded questions from
the audience Monday night. Mostly, the crowd of aspiring actors
wanted tricks of the trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping she could tell me her secrets," said Matthew
Jaworski, a 26-year-old student at the institute. Asked about
improvisation, Field recalled the genesis of a moment that wasn't in
the script. Spacek stopped during a scene in which she confronts
Marisa Tomei and told the director: "I shouldn't just slap her, I
should backhand her. It's more dismissive."</TE>
<TE>   Field made the change, and the scene had to be done half a dozen
times, he said. "God bless Marisa," Spacek added.</TE>
<TE>   Spacek talked about how set design helps shape character,
recounting how, on the 1973 movie "Badlands," trinkets and petticoats
filled drawers that would never be opened. "It was almost the
Stanislavsky method of set design," she said. "I would learn about
the character going on the set."</TE>
<TE>   She starts "with the most obvious" when preparing for a role, she
said. "I don't have a set way. Each character dictates the process."</TE>
<TE>   Field cautioned that what makes a movie work can't be contained in
dictums. "Films are mysterious creatures. Sometimes they work.
Sometimes they don't."</TE>
<TE>   After the talk, there were roses (red and white) for Spacek and
Field. This, after all, was the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only seen the movie twice," Spacek joked. "If I'm going to
keep talking about it, I'm going to have to see it again."</TE>
<TE>   What's Cookin'</TE>
<TE>   There are far too many chefs in Joe Miller's kitchen. It's Monday
night, and the modest white-tiled room is crowded with white jackets
and the sound of French. The five chefs stand side-by-side, elbows
touching, looking at passing diners from the open kitchen. A woman
walks by and they all look up from their work. "We're so excited!"
she exclaims. "It's like the Super Bowl!"</TE>
<TE>   A moment passes and Miller, the restaurant owner and head chef,
shouts out to a nearby table: "Later, we're going to do the 'full
monty'!"</TE>
<TE>   He has invited four of his colleagues, all of whom once hailed
from the famous French restaurant L'Orangerie, to create a French
five-course meal at his restaurant, Joe's Restaurant in Venice. Those
lucky enough to get a reservation this evening paid $85 per person
for the gastronomic event.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Francois Meteigner of La Cachette has commandeered a spot in
one corner where he prepares perfect plates of buttery terrine of
foie gras as well as spoonfuls of egg and caviar. Miller keeps an eye
on the stove where he has prepared his mushroom soup with Parmesan
froth. Conny Anderson of the Four Seasons Hotel periodically stops
work on his Petaluma squab to pose for pictures. Peter Roelent of the
Four Oaks Cafe stays focused on creating a perfect mouthful: deviled
scallops wrapped in applewood bacon. It's too early in the evening
for the chocolate cake with saffron mousseline and orange gelee
created by Ludovic Lefebvre of L'Orangerie, but the chef generously
describes the dessert as having "five different textures of
chocolate."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who worked at L'Orangerie in 1983, has been hosting this
evening annually for the past four years to build camaraderie among
his colleagues, he said. But that camaraderie can be fragile. While
Miller's colleagues work well independently in the kitchen, they
rarely exchange recipes or techniques, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the discussion turned to foam because Miller's
Parmesan froth for the mushroom soup didn't turn out as well as he
had hoped. One chef--Miller wouldn't name names--noted that at his
restaurant "we do those all the time," but when asked for a how-to,
the chef replied, "I'm not going to tell you."</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all have our own levels and boundaries that we don't
cross," Miller said. "It's not like it used to be where the chef
hides out back and does his secret terrine or secret sauce. But when
you work with a chef, you learn what he'll teach you and then that's
it."</TE>
<TE>   After the diners left and the chefs sat down for their own meal
and cigars, the conversation wasn't about food but about running a
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot more fun discussing that," Miller said.</TE>

<LD>On Friday, I take him for a little elective surgery, acknowledging
right up front that no surgery should be elective. Either you need it
or you don't.</LD>
<LD>   "This wasn't my idea," I explain to the dog.</LD>
<LD>   "I know," he says.</LD>
<TE>   We're standing at the pet clinic, at the front counter. On the
other end of the leash is my best and quietest friend. "Lucky" is
what we call him. Seemed like a good name at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Neuter, front desk," the pet clinic clerk calls over the P.A. to
the back shop. "Neuter, front desk."</TE>
<TE>   The chilling words echo through the clinic. Lucky looks at me. I
look at him. It's an awkward moment. At a time like this, only a dog
would still look at you with love in his eyes. Only a dog would be
forgiving of such savagery.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't my idea," I tell him again.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs and dads, we have a lot in common. We're both hard to live
with sometimes. We sneeze too loud and chomp our food, especially the
heavy, denser meats. We breathe between bites. We slurp all liquids.</TE>
<TE>   We shed, dogs and dads do. Cats make us crazy--almost
psychotic--as do those recent reports that they're cloning kittens.
Kittens? Grrrrr, kittens.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs and dads, we're distant cousins really. We'll chase a ball
till we drop. If we like something, we will eat it until we become
sick. Even in the best of times, our digestive tracts sound like air
horns. Some of God's better work, dogs and dads. Simple. Loyal.
Strong.</TE>
<TE>   "Neuter, front desk," the pet clinic clerk calls.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll be fine," I tell the dog.</TE>
<TE>   Here's one of those wicked twists life takes: The dog goes in for
an ear infection; the vet says maybe it's time for him to be
neutered. The cocker spaniel, fresh from his 5th birthday, leaves the
pet clinic with an appointment to be "fixed." I think we can all
learn from this.</TE>
<TE>   "In what sense, exactly, does he get fixed?" I ask my wife after
she makes the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fixed," I say. "I don't think that's the right word."</TE>
<TE>   For in a way, I explain, he'll never be more broken.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll get over it," my wife says. "Both of you."</TE>
<TE>   "Easy for you to say," I tell my wife, obviously a woman.</TE>
<TE>   And I leave Lucky there at the pet clinic, with his feet skating
on the cold linoleum floor, his eyes yelling at the pet clinic
worker, "Hey, there must be some mistake! You have the wrong dog!
Seriously, I'm fine! I'll use a condom!" and the pet clinic worker
assuring him that they don't make mistakes like that here, that
indeed he's the right dog. That he won't feel a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll die a virgin," I tell my wife when I get home.</TE>
<TE>   "The vet said it'd be best for him," my wife explains.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how, I don't remember, because I think a chronic virginity
is a sad state of affairs, even for a dog.</TE>
<TE>   A chaste life never did anyone much good, leaves you with a cold
bed and a cold heart and an unnecessary moral pureness. Watch any of
today's more popular movies. Chastity is the devil's work.</TE>
<TE>   "My dog, he'll die a virgin," I complain to my friend Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that Laker game?" Paul asks.</TE>
<TE>   See, no one cares. No one sees the bigger moral implications. This
dog, I'd take a bullet for this dog.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he'll never trust me again. Lucky, my loyal friend, the only
creature that would ever lick egg yolk from my mustache.</TE>
<TE>   "You should change his name," Paul says.</TE>
<TE>   "To what?"</TE>
<TE>   "To 'Can't Get Lucky.'"</TE>
<TE>   A day later, the dog comes home, without a trace of bitterness. He
can't jump, for obvious reasons, and he mostly leaves the stitches
alone, doesn't chew at them, for obvious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   He forgives me, mostly, but won't go near the minivan, which he
views as an accessory to the crime, an ambulance waiting to carry him
back to Dr. Frankenstein's pet clinic.</TE>
<TE>   And in the evening, he rests on the couch with the older daughter
and her new boyfriend, home from college for the weekend and watching
TV together late into the night. The dog keeps one eye on her. One
eye on him.</TE>
<TE>   Always the protector, the dog is the self-appointed sentry for any
funny business that might take place there on the couch. He has seen
enough movies to know what goes on between America's youth.</TE>
<TE>   Not going to happen. Not on his watch. Especially after all he's
just been through. "Make a move," he dares the boyfriend. "I dare
you: Make a move."</TE>
<TE>   So how have we rewarded such loyalty? Snip. Snip. And a lot of
painkillers. To think that they're cloning cats.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can clone a kitten, they'd better clone a dog," I tell my
wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they could clone Brad Pitt," says my older daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they could clone Kobe," says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   No, just my loyal dog, who sleeps on my feet as I write this, his
big heart beating against my toes.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sense, all driving in Los Angeles is window shopping. Unless
we're on our fretful way to a meeting with the auditor or the divorce
lawyer, most of us are able to appreciate our surroundings even as we
meander through Alhambra in search of a 2-year-old's birthday party.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps we're on the lookout for something--the next cool bar or
coffee place, a New Age bookstore, a decent bike shop, a new route
for our dog walk. Or maybe we're just urban explorers, trying to
figure out our city and its citizens. Who would live in an all black
house, we wonder. What brain disorder struck residential architects
in the 1970s? How can there be so many rich people in this town when
we don't seem to know any? Why were there not this many nice
apartments available when we were looking for one?</LD>
<LD>   Some of this curiosity is motivated by lust--house lust, which is
one of the most common forms of lust in L.A., preceded only perhaps
by career lust and maybe in some parts of town well-defined-lats
lust.</LD>
<TE>   We look at other people's houses and imagine how much more
satisfying our lives would be if only we had a turret or two, or a
river-stone-fronted Craftsman or a porch with white pillars. If only
we had vaulted ceilings and really nice stained glass windows in our
entryway, we would never speak harshly to our spouses, our children
would get good grades and quit sassing us, and maybe, in the serenity
of this tree-lined avenue or that landscaped garden, we would finish
that novel/quilt/sonata we've been yakking about for five years now.</TE>
<TE>   And this is all just driving by on the way to Big 5. When the
object of the drive is to actually look for homes with the purpose of
buying one, then this free-floating lust enters the courtship stage.</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I have just begun looking for a new house, and
we're still in the drive-by phase, partly because we really want to
check out the neighborhoods we think we're interested in, and mostly
because there are no houses at all for sale in Los Angeles County. Or
rather they're for sale in some secret alternative universe that
exists in the 15-second time warp between the moment the Realtor
pounds the "For Sale" sign into the yard and when she sticks the "In
Escrow" sign on top of it.</TE>
<TE>   But even in a softer market, the search for a house begins a
certain way. First there is the drive through the dream neighborhood,
the land of the dappled sidewalks, the velveteen lawns, the lovely
homes with their libraries and dens and multiple bedrooms, their
ample front porches, their spacious backyards. Imagine driving down
this lovely street on the way to work or school or the store. Imagine
how good it would feel.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the drive past homes we can actually afford, or
could if they were not in escrow already. Can we imagine making this
turn, driving down this street and heading home. No, no, maybe, yes.
Can we live with the sound of the freeway? Could we really pretend
it's just like the ocean? For years? Will our route to work take us
through a really nice neighborhood leaving us chronically
dissatisfied and depressed; will a trip to Trader Joe's route us
through an endless stretch of industrial wasteland? Can we stand it?</TE>
<TE>   See, curb appeal doesn't just refer to the house. It refers to the
drive to the house. What you see as you head home is part of home
too. The story that it tells about you, about why you're here and not
there and why you've traveled so.</TE>
<TE>   So my husband and I drive around with our friendly Realtor,
looking at houses that aren't for sale, but telling him: this street,
not that one; shuddering at some homes, swooning over others.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I know what you're looking for," he says confidently, as
if he can conjure it from nothing in a matter of weeks. And maybe he
can. Meanwhile, we'll just keep driving with lust in our hearts.</TE>

<LD>Crossing the Street Safely</LD>
<LD>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California, free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
presentations in English and Spanish. Today he talks to Caylee about
crossing the street safely.</LD>
<LD>   It was almost time for the school bell to ring and Caylee thought
that if she didn't hurry, she might be late. She rushed toward the
street corner near her school where the crossing guard, Mrs. Flores,
was standing.</LD>
<TE>   "Good morning, Caylee," Mrs. Flores said as Caylee arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Mrs. Flores, I'm in such a hurry. I might be late for school.
Can we cross the street right away?" Caylee pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Just then, Mrs. Flores' friend Otto the Auto drove to the corner
and overheard the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, Caylee and Mrs. Flores," Otto said. "You know, Caylee,
even if you're running late, you should always practice safety when
crossing the street."</TE>
<TE>   "That's right, Otto," Mrs. Flores agreed. "Children often cannot
judge how fast a car is traveling toward them, or how far away the
cars are. This can be very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "Right," Otto said. "You should always stay at the corner, wait
until the crossing guard is in the middle of the intersection and
watch for the crossing guard to wave you through."</TE>
<TE>   "You're right," Caylee said. "Sometimes when I'm late, I get so
excited that I forget to practice safety. But now that you've
reminded me, I'll always remember."</TE>
<TE>   "Great," Otto said. "Now that you've learned the first lesson of
the day, let's cross the street together and get to school."</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit
Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and teacher
information and fun activities for kids.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A lot of mystery writers feel they're doing a service by putting the
world back into place at the end of their novels," George Pelecanos
told a crowd at a book event last year. "I don't want to do that ....
The world is forever put out of place by murder. Violence ripples
out. The ripples get smaller in time, but they're still there. I want
to entertain. I want the thriller part to work, but I also want to
leave you disturbed at the end."</LD>
<LD>   His new novel, "Devil to Pay" (Little Brown, $24.95, 288 pages),
set in Washington, D.C., accomplishes that, but the feeling of unease
has less to do with the final state of its heroes than with the fate
of its villains. The latter would be Garfield "D" (for Death) Potter,
Carlton "Dirty" Little and Charles White, three young savages who,
high on the potent pot hydro, gun down a man whom they feel
disrespected them and, by mistake, kill his 9-year-old nephew as
well.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately for them, the boy had been a quarterback for the
Petworth Panthers, a peewee team coached by private detectives Derek
Strange and Terry Quinn. The thoughtful, middle-aged Strange and the
younger, more volatile Quinn met as antagonists and wound up as edgy
partners in crime fighting in the author's last book, "Right as
Rain." They're tough hombres you wouldn't want to cross, whether
you're the trio of sociopaths or a vicious, oversized pimp named
Worldwide Wilson specializing in teenage runaways.</TE>
<TE>   Pelecanos rightly has been praised for the realism of his gritty
D.C. milieu, the depth of character he achieves with dead-on speech
cadences and his patented mood-setting pop-music references.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other writers who excel at place and character.
Pelecanos' uniqueness comes from his bravery in ignoring the concept
of cool. Unlike many of today's chroniclers of streetwise behavior,
he's not afraid to put heart and humanity into his mix, and it pays
off in reader involvement.</TE>
<TE>   His people are the flawed products of a cruel and unyielding
social structure. His heroes are not glib questing knights who rarely
miss a hot gourmet meal. They're uneven-tempered, hard-bitten men
suffering from dark moods and an inability to maintain meaningful
relationships. The only thing separating them from the bad guys is
their basic decency, a trait that is repaid by twin rays of hope at
this novel's end. But don't expect any sort of cathartic release from
their triumph over the felons.</TE>
<TE>   Pelecanos' prose is distinguished not only by hopelessly human
protagonists but also by the humanity he finds in even the basest of
his bad men. In just one short reminiscence on his loss of innocence,
Potter, the worst of the homicidal young thugs, is transformed from
heartless killer to heartbreaking victim as the author brilliantly
sets us up for his uneasy finale.</TE>
<TE>   S.J. Rozan Covers Hot-Button Topics</TE>
<TE>   S.J. Rozan is no slouch when it comes to charting the more shadowy
areas of the human heart. Her series features upbeat and logical
Lydia Chin and moody, experienced Bill Smith, a unique private
detective duo made even more unusual by the author's decision to
alternate the first-person narrative with each book.</TE>
<TE>   "Winter and Night" (St. Martin's Minotaur, $24.95, 338 pages) is a
powerfully moving tale told by Smith that not only covers several
hot-button topics, from our national obsession with winning at all
costs to the horror of high school homicide, but also forces its
usually enigmatic narrator to unlock many of his family secrets.</TE>
<TE>   His back story comes calling in the form of a never-before-met
15-year-old nephew, Gary Russell, who shows up in a jail cell in need
of help. Before Smith can do much more than arrange his bail, the boy
disappears, sending the sleuth to a suburban New Jersey home and an
estranged sister whom he hasn't seen in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   It's a nightmare visit. The sister hates him for something that
happened in their past. Her tantrum-prone husband blames him for
Gary's disappearance. And the upscale little town, in the midst of a
high school football fever so intense its citizens eagerly overlook
such matters as vandalism, rape, drug-dealing and murder, has its own
unfriendly way of dealing with New York troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery element is a strong one, involving not only the
apparent homicide of a young woman who courted the gridiron champs
with drugs but a crime that took place decades before. And in leading
up to an ending involving a troubled, destruction-bound teen, Rozan
tiptoes unscathed through the minefield of fiction fueled by current
events.</TE>
<TE>   But her main accomplishment remains the deep and complex
relationship of her appealing protagonists. Judging by the last few
Chin-Smith adventures, Smith's narratives tend to be darker. Here,
the added intensity of facing not only a frightening crime but also
the long-subdued and painful family secrets make him more vulnerable
to both danger and the romantic feelings he has for his partner. It
will be interesting to see where Rozan takes the two of them from
here.</TE>
<TE>   '60s Murder Tale Nostalgic, Not Cozy</TE>
<TE>   Black River Falls, Iowa, may have had a population of only 27,300
in the early 1960s, but as we discover in Ed Gorman's highly
entertaining series featuring struggling young lawyer Sam McClain, it
was not wanting for chaos. In the new "Save the Last Dance for Me"
(Carroll and Graf, $24, 230 pages), the leaders of two religious
flocks--a snake-handling faith healer and a philandering
minister--are sent to meet their maker.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic movement prompted by
John Kennedy's nomination is underway and, to top things off, the
other presidential hopeful, Richard Nixon, has decided to spend a day
with one of his biggest supporters, the demanding, powerful Judge
Esme Ann Whitney, who is Sam's main client. Not trusting the dim
local police chief to solve the crimes, she orders the lawyer to "get
this ridiculous snake mess cleared up" before Nixon's arrival. " ...
We'll look like hillbillies.... The man is an intellectual, for God's
sake."</TE>
<TE>   The prolific, multi-award-winning Gorman seems to be having the
time of his life spinning these warmly nostalgic but not exactly cozy
tales of middle America at the dawn of the age of sex, drugs and rock
'n' roll. His pleasant, libidinous 5-foot-5, 24-year-old
lawyer-detective is a wonderfully fresh, opinionated, parboiled hero.
His fellow townspeople, though in the main arrogant or dumb as posts
or bigoted or vindictive or homicidal, are strangely good company.
His inevitably star-crossed romances (here, the lady goes back to her
unfaithful husband) are properly poignant. The answer to whodunit is
clever and uncontrived.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Correspondence flourished. Photos were exchanged. Friendships
developed.</LD>
<LD>   Responses to the inquiries poured in during April and May.</LD>
<LD>   Two New Jersey girls said, "We never heard of pinching on St.
Patrick's Day." Another person added, "We're too old for pinching." A
boy from the same school said, "The idea is sort of dumb." "We don't
have to wear green. We can wear any color we want and nothing will
happen to us," stated another.</LD>
<TE>   New Jersey boys and girls picked up ideas from the inquiry. A boy
said, "It sounds like fun. Guess we'll start the habit." A girl
concluded, "We don't pinch, but next year we're going to start."</TE>
<TE>   Once in a while there were answers from adults. From the
Waterbury, Conn., Department of Education: "Pinching on St. Patrick's
Day for not wearing green? Never! The leprechauns [Irish fairies]
would not allow it."</TE>
<TE>   An elementary supervisor from Sandusky, Ohio, wrote: "We don't
have any customs regarding the wearing of the green, and definitely
do not pinch."</TE>
<TE>   Danville, Va., sixth-graders answered that they had never heard of
pinching on St. Patrick's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle River, Wis., replied with a simple, "No, we don't."</TE>
<TE>   From the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.: "To tell the truth,
it has never been a custom of ours."</TE>
<TE>   An Indiana girl claimed: "I do not pinch, but I do wear green."</TE>
<TE>   In Waukegan, Ill., "Only a few people pinch," informed a student.</TE>
<TE>   The Ormond Beach, Fla., school cafeteria made green cake, and the
cooks wore funny green hats. They had a crossword puzzle in the shape
of a four-leaf clover in the library for students to work on. Some
classes composed poems.</TE>
<TE>   Goldsboro, N.C., wrote that they do pinch.</TE>
<TE>   Billings, Mont., also responded that they pinch. However, if you
are Irish and do not wear green and someone pinches you, you can
pinch them back.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: How can the class get more information about St.
Patrick's Day?</TE>
<TE>   Betty Martens is a retired teacher. She still has the booklet her
students compiled after doing a similar survey. This story will be on
The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>
