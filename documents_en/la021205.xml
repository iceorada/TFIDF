<HD>A prince gave us our Christmas tree tradition</HD>

<LD>The tradition of the Christmas tree came to America from lands far
away. Queen Victoria, the famous queen of England from 1837 to 1901,
married a German man named Prince Albert. He brought the German
custom of decorating Christmas trees to England. A picture of his
family around the Christmas tree appeared in the newspapers in
England, the United States and Canada. Soon people in Western Europe
and North America began decorating trees at Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   During Victorian times, there were many ways to decorate a tree.
In the days before electricity, people lighted their trees with
candles. There was always a bucket of water nearby in case of fire.
Small gifts and homemade ornaments were hung from the tree branches.
Decorations were often made from natural items, such as berries,
seashells, gilded walnuts and popcorn. Sometimes Victorian families
created a themed tree. For example, they might celebrate their
patriotism by trimming the tree with red, white and blue bows, small
flags and paper stars.</LD>
<LD>   Paper link chains were one easy tree decoration that children
still enjoy making today. Cut strips of paper 4 inches long and 1
inch wide. Overlap and glue one end slightly over the other, forming
a circle link. Slip the next piece of paper through the link. Overlap
and glue it together, forming two links. Continue in this way until
the chain is as long as you want it.</LD>
<TE>   You can make your own Victorian tree ornaments at Rancho Los
Cerritos, one of the few remaining two-story adobe homes in Southern
California. Its annual Christmas open house is Dec. 15 from 1 to 4
p.m. Admission is free. For more information, call (562) 570-1755, or

<HD>'David Dreidel's Hanukkah Adventure'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: David Dreidel has been spun hard, blown
away by the wind and carried off by a dog. He rests at the feet of a
sad little boy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E.G. Walker</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alady joins the boy on the porch, puts her arms around his shoulders
and says, "I'm sorry, Josh. I couldn't get you a Hanukkah present. I
spent my last pennies on the blue candles. It's important that we
have candles to light for each of the eight days of Hanukkah." She
sits on the steps next to him.</LD>
<LD>   "It's OK, Mama. I liked watching you light the candles. Can I
light them tomorrow night?"</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, you light the two candles, and I will recite the blessing."</LD>
<TE>   "From last year, I remember the story about the miracle of the
light. Will you tell it to me again?"</TE>
<TE>   I listen as the mom tells him.</TE>
<TE>   "A long time ago, even before there was Hanukkah, the Greek king
Antiochus began a campaign to force the Jews to adopt his religion.
The soldiers put symbols and statues of Greek gods in the holy
temple."</TE>
<TE>   Josh and I both listen, without saying a word. This is an exciting
story, no matter how many times you hear it. She continues the tale.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a terrible insult to the Jewish people. See, the holy
temple was very special to them. It was like the center of their
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "After many years of battle, a famous warrior, Judah Maccabee, led
the Jews into battle against the enemy. They won and reclaimed their
temple.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Jewish army wanted to rededicate the holy house, they
were unable to find enough specially prepared oil to light their
everlasting light in their sacred temple. Everlasting means that they
must never let the light go out."</TE>
<TE>   "Couldn't they use candles like we do?" Josh asks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday: How will David Dreidel's Hanukkah adventure end?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: A dreidel is a four-sided top used in a game played
during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Each side has a different
Hebrew letter. A shin means give or put in a token. A hey means take
half the tokens. A gimel stands for take all the tokens. A nun means
take nothing. Before each spin of the dreidel, players put a
designated number of tokens in the middle. The first player spins the
dreidel. When the dreidel stops, the letter facing up determines what
the player puts in or takes out.</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>That is so chicken: a cooking contest</HD>
<DH>A Silver Lake group stages its second Yardbird Social -- in
the name of community unity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember the good old days of Yardbird Socials, when once a year the
green Kentucky hills would sweeten with the smoky scent of roasted
poultry? Remember when families would gather together under white
parasols and straw boaters to watch with bated breath as the town
tasters chose that year's prizewinning chicken entree? No?</LD>
<LD>   Well, neither do we, but the National Yardbird Assn. is about to
tell us. Re-instituted last year in Silver Lake's bohemian enclave,
the association -- whose stated mission is "bringing people together
through roasted chicken" -- is doing its best to resurrect a
long-forgotten tradition with the 2002 Winternational Yardbird
Social. Set for Saturday, anyone with a skillet-cooked chicken and a
$10 prepaid entry fee can put their culinary skills to the test. The
prize, the Golden Wishbone, resides with the winner until the next
competition.</LD>
<TE>   According to Phil Goldwhite, a founding member and the head of the
association's San Gabriel chapter, the original yardbird social was
born "in the decimated South of the post-Civil War period." Goldwhite
explains that in a country weary of "the wholesale destruction of
war, people turned from fighting each other to cooking chickens in
order to solve differences and reconstruct their destroyed
communities." The association points to a 1878 mention by Mark Twain
in the Vicksburg Herald Express that spoke to the tradition: "The
coveted golden wishbone is up for grabs again."</TE>
<TE>   "Like break dancing is to gang combat," adds founding member Ivan
Uranga, "the yardbird social offered an alternative to violence in
the form of chicken-cooking competitions." According to founding
member Jon Alain Guzik, yardbirding as a tradition eventually died
out during the Great Depression "because there was no chicken," he
says. "Then, with FDR's New Deal, there was suddenly a 'chicken in
every pot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Yardbird members claim to have discovered the association's
original 19th century archives at a garage sale in Pacoima and to
have been seduced by the idea of poultry roasting as a means of
soothing ill will and creating strong community bonds. Inspired to
form a modern-day equivalent, (which currently boasts chapters in Los
Feliz, Echo Park, Venice, Eagle Rock, Hollywood, Topanga and Burbank)
the association threw its first yardbird social last year. While
there is no documentation to substantiate the association's claims
concerning the purported Yardbird tradition, in the end the question
of whether the social is legitimate historical tribute or merely
edible art prank matters little. What matter is good friends, good
times and good eats.</TE>

been moonlighting as the bass player for Al Lay, who happens to be
her older brother. Now ex-Sonny Bones member Al (who's also appeared
on a Down by Law album) will be the second guitarist for Lost and
Found live. The Manhattan Beach natives share a gift for some of the
smartest pop tunes on the L.A. scene. The elder Lay won acclaim for
such songs as "Perfect World," from his debut album, "Life." Baby sis
shows off wicked chops on the indie-pop gems "I Wanna Believe" and
"Flashes." Lost and Found plays the Troubadour on Dec. 14; Al's next
performance is Dec. 17 at Dorscia (formerly Moomba) in West
Hollywood.</LD>

<DH>British actor and comedian Eddie Izzard tends to bring
smiles no matter what he's wearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Uslan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The line to see British comedian and actor Eddie Izzard at Virgin
Megastore on Sunset began forming at 3 p.m. and didn't disappear
until almost midnight. An emergency supply of DVDs had to be rushed
in from the warehouse. As the two-hour event lapsed easily into five,
one Virgin staffer declared this the biggest in-store signing in the
last eight years.</LD>
<LD>   While an estimated 750 fans waited outside, Izzard worked his way
through his first signing in the United States -- arm sore, but
stamina impressive.</LD>
<LD>   In town to promote the DVD release of his Emmy-winning one-man
show, "Dress to Kill," Izzard, 40 and demure in a purple suit -- no
dress -- seemed determined to greet every fan.</LD>
<TE>   "It got tricky because I was enjoying chatting and I seemed to be
going for ages and they said, 'You've just done 30 people,' " Izzard
recalled the next day. Lizz Green, 23, had driven from Claremont to
Burbank to watch Izzard tape "The Tonight Show" and had to join the
line where it curved into the residential streets of West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of another person that I would stand in line for 4
1/2 hours to meet for two minutes, but it was totally worth it,"
Green said. "I was so impressed that he took time to chat with each
person and actually make eye contact." Izzard seemed glad to do it,
even with trips to San Francisco and New York to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "I like meeting people face-to-face. I'm interested to know what's
on their minds," he said. "When you get into bigger venues, there's a
certain distance and the light's in your eyes, so you're playing to a
feeling of an audience as opposed to actually seeing people."</TE>
<TE>   What he saw on this night was his growing American fan base: some
who noticed his rise in Britain in the mid-1990s, others who caught
"Dress to Kill" on HBO in 1999, and others who knew him as an actor
first -- he appeared this year as Charlie Chaplin in "The Cat's
Meow."</TE>
<TE>   Although Izzard has been focusing on plays and movies of late, it
is his stand-up that forms the core of people's connection to him. He
frequently gets personal, explaining his identity as an "executive
transvestite," for example, right before launching into highly
informed riffs on gun violence and the history of the Western World,
acting as Hitler, Napoleon, and the officer who arrested him for
stealing makeup along the way.</TE>
<TE>   When Green got to Izzard, she thanked him for being so upfront
with his identity as a transvestite. "He stopped writing and looked
up and said, 'Don't worry. We'll make it. After all, it is our
millennium.' "</TE>
<TE>   Izzard was clearly pleased to see "quite an eclectic bunch of
people, age ranging all over the place, the look is all over the
place, and I love that.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a transvestite, people do externally look and say, 'Well,
I'm not going to like that stuff,' " Izzard said. "They assume it's
going to be very sexuality-centric comedy, you know, 'two lipsticks
go into a bar ... ' " But those who've been exposed to the world of
Izzard know better.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes people laugh until they forget what he's wearing," said
Nikki MacGyver, 22, who has met Izzard about 10 times, most recently
when he was performing "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" in London's
West End. "He's comfortable with himself, and that's contagious."</TE>
<TE>   With Izzard's Broadway debut set for March -- a second run of "Joe
Egg" -- and a world tour filled with new material to follow, he seems
in position to keep his fan base growing.</TE>
<TE>   "His humor is always upbeat and optimistic, rather than angry and
vindictive," says MacGyver. "Of course, there will always be a part
of me who wants him to stay the little secret of his loyal fans, but
if Eddie ever becomes mainstream, it will be because the mainstream
moves to him. And with the message he presents, that could only be a
good thing."</TE>

<DH>Coffee, tea or mall? Every decision can affect a first
date, and strategies can rival a chess match. Just take our advice.</DH>

<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the reincarnation of a failed retro restaurant in Irvine, a
stone's throw from the John Wayne Airport. This time it's called
Oasis, and this time it's got loads of decor on the walls by
ultra-popular undersea artist Wyland: from paintings of whales
floating in fantasy seas to pewter bas-reliefs that look like
open-mouth portraits of "Flipper."</LD>
<LD>   But singles ages 25 to 35 are drawn here as if it's the coolest
place on the planet. They're standing in line to register for
"Pre-Dating," also known as speed dating, and they've each paid $28
for that privilege.</LD>
<LD>   In a whirlwind roundelay, hopeful young men and women spend five
minutes talking one on one before the bell rings and they're on to
the next table. They fill out a sheet marking each person they've met
as a "yes," "no" or as having possible "friend/business" potential.</LD>
<TE>   Only when two people choose one another will contact info be
exchanged ... meaning the possibility for heart-wrenching rejection
looms as large as at a junior high dance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that it works," said Rob Lile, 35, of La Palma, a
chemist with a nervous grin. This was his second rapid-dating
experience. "The first was interesting. I saw a woman who I had dated
earlier in the year. She saw me and was more uncomfortable than I
was. At the end when the bell rang I said, 'Are you gonna mark me
down?' And she said, 'Well, that's a personal question!' I think the
concept is great, but for me, it just hasn't worked out yet."</TE>
<TE>   Why do they do it? Because when it comes to first dates, most
everyone is as vulnerable as a character in a Matt Groening cartoon.
Your date says something innocuous like, "You look nice." You
immediately fast forward to a stream-of-consciousness fiesta of
negativity, "Am I too fat/skinny in this outfit? Do I smell? What
does that mean, nice? Oh, God, why am I here?"</TE>
<TE>   Human beings dread first dates.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than a job interview. Like a day in court. Too much pressure
to maintain eye contact. All are descriptions of close encounters of
the first-date kind given by those interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Even in these days of high-speed communications through the cell
phone and the Internet, getting to know someone romantically remains
a challenge, especially in Southern California. Guys and dolls are
often separated by vast geographical expanses. Mr. Pasadena might
have an incurable crush on Miss Laguna Beach, but how will they get
together, especially for a dinner date during rush hour?</TE>
<TE>   Several of those interviewed for this story said that after
graduating from high school or college, meeting members of the
opposite sex becomes more difficult. There is less time for
socializing and you can't always count on meeting at work. If you're
employed by a high-tech firm, co-workers are mostly men. The opposite
is true for women who work in a bank.</TE>
<TE>   Those who count on friends or family members to set them up should
know the cold, hard national statistics. Compare the success rate of
liking someone introduced to you by a friend -- 17% -- to liking
someone introduced to you by a family member -- 12%.</TE>
<TE>   The local chapter of a national dating service, It's Just Lunch,
reports that even with its help, only 30% of first dates lead to
relationships of more than a few dates.</TE>
<TE>   Say the connection is miraculously made and a blind date or first
date is in full swing, what can go wrong will. Horror stories ranged
from running into the woman's ex-boyfriend, which ruined 45 minutes
of the date, to a sad masquerade in which the woman described herself
as a Jodie Foster look-alike to a blind date who contended he
resembled John F. Kennedy Jr. "He did look like a Kennedy but the
horsy side of the family," said the woman, who ditched him at a club
to join friends in a bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for the people who come on our show," said Roger Lodge,
host of "Blind Date," a reality program that inserts a camera into
the first dates of complete strangers. "Dating in the year 2002 is
hard. And the old traditional places of meeting people -- in a bar or
club -- nobody wants to do that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   First dates are excruciatingly awkward. That old-fashioned dinner
at a fancy restaurant, with the man showing up at the door in a suit
with an armful of flowers, is not the way to go. The more low-key the
better, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I always recommend that a first date be during the day and just a
quick cup of coffee or lunch. You don't have to give up the entire
evening, and if it's not working you can politely say you have to be
somewhere else. The worst is to have an evening planned, and if it
doesn't work, it becomes treacherous."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Dolan, one of five sisters who host the radio chat show
"The Satellite Sisters" -- which will begin broadcasting in L.A. on
the ABC Radio Network in January -- has first-date phobia.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because I go out with men doesn't necessarily mean I date,"
she said. "My relationships are more like hostage situations. It's
like an all-out emotional takeover. Once I did have a first date, and
halfway through the dinner I realized we were on a date and got
completely uncomfortable. I wanted to pay and I wanted to set the
tone, and he wouldn't let me and then the bill somehow got lost. We
sat there for half an hour not paying the bill."</TE>
<TE>   All kinds of weird things can happen on first dates. So it's high
time for an intelligent discourse on a topic that's an emotional
minefield. The discussion will cover a range of down-and-dirty
subjects such as: Who pays? And should there be a kiss or even sex on
the first date? Some general advice and practical tips on where to go
on a first date will be included. Let the yakking begin.</TE>
<TE>   Who should pay</TE>
<TE>   The consensus among men we talked to is that, on the first date,
he picks up the tab.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy should pay," said Raj Singh, 19, of Costa Mesa, a
computer science sophomore at UC Irvine with long, raven hair tied up
in a top knot. "That's the way I was brought up."</TE>
<TE>   His friend Danish Ahmed, 19, of Santa Ana, a clean-cut Internet
company worker with a serious manner, agrees. "I think on the first
date the guy should pay. Even if a girl asks me out, I'll pick her up
and I'll pay. That's how it is. But when you're boyfriend-girlfriend,
then whoever."</TE>
<TE>   "I usually say I'll pay," said Seth Bouvier, 27, a UCLA
neuroscience doctoral student who looks like Matthew Modine's younger
brother. "But if the person insists, I don't really care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What the guys need to know is that a lot of the women out there
don't like feeling "paid for."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm uncomfortable with it," said Liz Dolan, another of the
Satellite Sisters. "In the beginning, it should be very fifty-fifty,
just to set the tone for the rest of the relationship. Starting out
in an anachronistic situation doesn't bode well for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those interviewed thought it was fine for the man to offer
to pay, but they also thought that he should listen to the woman if
she wants to go Dutch. Plan beforehand so no one is uneasy on the big
night.</TE>
<TE>   Planning the date</TE>
<TE>   We know who's paying. Now there's got to be a game plan. The
burden is on the asker, who should definitely have some ideas. But
the askee should offer input too.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd ask her what she wants to do and tell her what I want to do.
That way she feels more a part of it and not dominated," Ahmed said.</TE>
<TE>   "One person could pick the movie, the other person could pick a
place to have dinner," said Becky Vansickle, 19, of Valencia, a UCI
environmental engineering sophomore with long brown hair and a feline
quality reminiscent of Julie Newmar. "When you know what's going on,
you're not going to be too anxious."</TE>
<TE>   Still, you could leave room for spontaneity. "If it's going well,
don't be afraid to say, 'Let's go here,' or if it's not going well,
then you can cut it short," Bouvier said.</TE>
<TE>   What to do?</TE>
<TE>   The common goal of a first date is to break the ice, to get to
know each other, to create the kind of atmosphere that sparks a
friendship that could ignite into a wild romance.</TE>
<TE>   Start slow, said most of those interviewed. No ocean kayaking or
any other activity for which a woman has to wear a bathing suit, said
the Satellite Sisters.</TE>
<TE>   A picnic? Way too romantic, said the guys from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing was a great topic of discussion, with most of the women up
for it and the men feeling indifferent or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad idea," said Brian Jackson, 25, a baby-faced neuroscience
doctoral student at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "It sets you up for looking like a fool even if you can dance,"
said John Ohab, 22, Jackson's hyper-articulate classmate. "And also,
how do you talk? It's so loud -- hand signals or what? 'Let's go to a
rave, take drugs and look at the flashing lights'? No."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, none of the women interviewed said she would judge a man
by the way he danced. "I'm a big dancer," said Lian Dolan, another of
the Satellite Sisters. "I would rate a man's willingness to dance as
character-revealing. It's will they dance, not if they're good."</TE>
<TE>   Other dud dates? The mall. Too eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   A gallery opening or an art walk would be OK. But a visit to an
art museum? No.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to stand around and talk about art and not sound
pretentious," said another Satellite Sister, Monica Dolan.</TE>
<TE>   Going to a book or record store was another dud. "I don't want to
see what a guy reads right off the bat," Sheila Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   "If he picks up the complete Andrea Bocelli collection, that is a
tipoff," Lian Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   Again, keeping things simple is key, most agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Contestants on "Blind Date" have gone everywhere, from hiking to
strip clubs, Lodge said. But the best dates include some physical
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a situation that seems to work best. They play tennis or go
indoor rock climbing. It seems to ease the tension and gets them to
loosen up quite a bit," Lodge said.</TE>
<TE>   It's best if the activity isn't competitive or strenuous. A walk
in a tree-lined park, through a neighborhood filled with remarkable
architecture or along a beach rated highly.</TE>
<TE>   So did goofy retro sports like miniature golf and bowling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good fun," Lian Dolan said. "Both should be pretty bad at
it. It's a great equalizer."</TE>
<TE>   A caveat: Do not take your date bowling if you are practically a
pro, Bouvier said. "If you bowl a 210 and have a hand brace and
you're bringing your own ball and shoes -- bad idea."</TE>
<TE>   Sporting events like baseball or basketball games were called good
first dates because you can talk during the game.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a good date if you're playing, though. "The worst first
date is when the guy says, 'Come watch me play softball,' " Liz Dolan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Going for coffee has more promise, she said. "It's better than
meeting for a drink because there's no 'are we having dinner or not?'
debate going on in your head. You're in, you're out. Nobody gets
hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Just make sure your date drinks coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise it's like dragging a vegetarian to the steakhouse. They
would just sit there. Like, all pouty," UCLA grad student Ohab said.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, this is America, so the movie date remains one of
the most popular. But not by itself. Sitting quietly in a dark
theater is the worst way to try to get to know someone. Movie dates
should be combined with other activities like going out for dessert
or taking a walk or a drive.</TE>
<TE>   Be especially creative in picking the theater, Bouvier said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is L.A. It's a spectacle to go to a movie. There's so many
theaters and so much going on. Go to the Chinese or the Crest or the
Cinerama Dome. Then it's more of an event."</TE>
<TE>   Kiss?</TE>
<TE>   The date is almost over and it went pretty well. Should there be a
kiss? All those interviewed said it shouldn't be a requirement, but
some said it's a great test of whether there's chemistry. Guys
shouldn't feel any more pressured to try for a kiss than girls should
feel they have to give in.</TE>
<TE>   It should be natural, not forced, Lodge said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to say this of my gender, but many times the guy doesn't
pay attention. If he had, he would have known going into the kiss
that the girl didn't want to give and he wouldn't have had to look
like a fool on national TV. Hey, guys, if the girl turns her head,
don't go in for a second one."</TE>
<TE>   Sex?</TE>
<TE>   The date went really well. Should there be more than a kiss? The
nearly unanimous decision was no. You should leave a little mystery.
These days it's a safety issue, and there are emotional reasons. But
the dissenting voice had an interesting twist, indicating that the
sexual revolution is not over.</TE>
<TE>   "If you really like the person, then you want to tend not to do
it. But if you're just having a good time and you don't think you
really want to date the person permanently, then why not? There's a
curve at which if it's going well, you should have sex, but if it's
going really well, then you should not," Bouvier said.</TE>
<TE>   Advice for first daters</TE>
<TE>   You're all set to go out. What should you keep in mind as you
splash on cologne, check movie times, do your hair?</TE>
<TE>   "Things you're looking for: no monologues, eats with mouth closed,
has some idea of current events," Monica Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful not to lose yourself," Sheila Dolan said. "Set clear
boundaries in the beginning and really take your time."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't talk on the cell phone the whole date, that's just rude.
And guys, don't hit on the waitress and don't have wandering eyes. If
you're out on a date with Julie, then you're out with Julie, not
Trixie the waitress," Lodge said.</TE>
<TE>   "Show her a bit of fun," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   "Have confidence. Come across as a gentleman: nice, cool, not too
aggressive but not timid," Ahmed said.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust your instincts. If this person has a glimmer of hope, give
him a chance. I married someone I hated in college," Lian Dolan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't put on a facade. If you're not the dress shirt-and-slacks
kind of guy, don't show up at the door in that," Vansickle said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just do it. How bad could it be?" Liz Dolan said. "I think we all
invest too much importance in the first date. It's just one night of
your life and it could be a lot of fun."</TE>

<TE>   A few first dates</TE>
<TE>   Here are some suggestions for a first date. Make a trial run ahead
of time, as it's always a good idea not to go to a strange place with
someone you're trying to impress.</TE>
<TE>   At the movies:</TE>
<TE>   Go for a slice of history at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. Built
in 1963 and recently restored, it looks like half a giant white
stucco golf ball. Cinerama Dome, 6360 Sunset Blvd., (323) 464-4226.</TE>
<TE>   A walk on the beach:</TE>
<TE>   You can walk for miles in either direction on Huntington Beach,
with pelicans gliding by and surfers catching waves. The beach,
Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street, Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Just dessert:</TE>
<TE>   With its art nouveau entry, the Sugarplum Bakery in L.A. looks
like a patisserie beamed here from Paris with its picture-perfect
European desserts. Share a slice of the signature Saint Honore,
layers of chocolate and cream. Sugarplum Bakery, 7122 Beverly Blvd.,
(323) 934-7900.</TE>
<TE>   Bowlerama:</TE>
<TE>   Try Regal Lanes in Orange, the largest bowling center in the West,
with a funky north-county-meets-Bavaria decor. Forget the late night
rock bowling scene (much too loud). Regal Lanes, 1485 N. Tustin Ave.,
(714) 997-9901.</TE>

<HD>Gingerbread houses without the frustration</HD>

<LD>For many aspiring bakers, building a house made from gingerbread is
only slightly less difficult than building one from wood. Presuming
they can even get the four walls standing and cemented with frosting,
the roof could then collapse under the weight of its peppermint
shingles, making the whole project a big, sticky mess.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a pain in the neck," admits Kathy Pettit, culinary
coordinator for Sur La Table. That's why the gourmet cooking store
and school offers its annual Gingerbread House Workshops--so parents
and children can experience the joys of gingerbread without the
frustration.</LD>
<LD>   In the two-hour class, the hard work of building the houses is
practically done. Each parent-child pair receives a house in
prefabricated pieces that fit together easily, leaving more than
enough time to trim a window with butterscotch or decorate a door
with gum drops.</LD>
<TE>   The icing on the cake: They can bring their edible sculptures home
when they're finished.</TE>
<TE>   Gingerbread House Workshops, Sur La Table, 301 Wilshire Blvd., Los
Angeles. Saturday, 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.;
Tuesday, Dec. 17, 6 p.m.; $75; (866) 328-5412.</TE>

<HD>Minimalist, with a den</HD>
<DH>Opaline features a spare look, an intriguing menu and late
hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The corner of Beverly Boulevard and Vista Street was shrouded for
weeks while construction turned red, the hip all-American cafe, into
the considerably more elegant Opaline. A band of citron-green on the
facade pays tribute to the name, which is what Oscar Wilde called the
color of his preferred drink, the notorious (and long since outlawed)
absinthe.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, the chic minimalist restaurant wears a palette of somber
neutrals anchored by a stunning column of light. Bare windows punched
in the curved facade look onto the Beverly Boulevard cityscape.</LD>
<LD>   David Rosoff, who ran Michael's for the last five years, is
general manager and a partner in Opaline. The chef is David Lentz,
most recently of China Grill in Las Vegas. His first menu is
something like Jar crossed with Lucques: in other words,
sophisticated-sounding comfort food with a Mediterranean spin. It's
not the same old-same old: This menu actually sounds interesting.</LD>
<TE>   For starters, Lentz proposes pumpkin risotto with chorizo and baby
squid, bay leaf-dusted scallops with lentils and smoked bacon in a
mushroom broth, or a crepe stuffed with rabbit confit and Iberian
ham. Few restaurants would dare offer a salad of roasted beets and
arugula with braised lamb tongue, but Opaline does. (Unfortunately,
it's not very good. Mine was woefully overcooked.)</TE>
<TE>   Lentz does his own version of Zuni Cafe's roast chicken for two.
His is an organic bird presented with bread stuffing and a rather
oily gratin of Tuscan black cabbage. There's a Moroccan-spiced
braised pork shoulder, not a cut you see often either, served with
couscous in its braising juices. Beef cheek shows up in a pasta dish
made with very chewy orecchiette ("little ears") pasta from Puglia.
This menu is not light fare by any means, and at least on a first
look, the food doesn't live up to the promise of the descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Red's next-door bar, Red-Eye, has been turned into "the den," a
long, narrow room furnished with a banquette and a counter with
stools. The bar is actually behind the scenes, so it's more like
eating in a sleek hallway. Here, walk-ins can order off the regular
menu or from the den's list of "small plates" from $4 to $6. How
about a little duck confit with white beans and sausage, or perhaps
some lacquered lamb ribs, if you're feeling peckish?</TE>
<TE>   The most exciting thing about Opaline is its innovative wine list,
with offerings from truly interesting producers all over the globe.
You can order by the glass, by the half-liter (perfect for two) or by
the bottle. It's really a pleasure when someone makes such an
intelligent effort.</TE>
<TE>   Opaline plans to stay open until 11:30 p.m. most nights, so now
there's somewhere new to go after the movies or the theater. Oh, and
it's open for lunch too, on weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Opaline</TE>
<TE>   Where: 7450 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When: Open for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday-Friday;
for dinner from 5:30 to 11:30 p.m. Monday-Saturday. Full bar. Valet
parking.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: Appetizers, $6 to $12; main courses, $16 to $23; desserts,
$7.</TE>

<LD>AN ultra-sexy and short animated movie arrived at my desk today, and
28 seconds later, I was deep inside a cartoon version of Ivan Kane's
nightclub world of mischief and fun.</LD>
<LD>   Kane, a master mood-setter, created the animated short for his
invitation to the second anniversary party for his club Deep next
Tuesday. The star is a Cool Cat with VIP status who arrives like Tony
Manero (the soundtrack is "Stayin' Alive"), high-fives Kane and is
pursued by the ladies until he winds up in a tryst with a Pamela
Anderson look-alike in one of the club's infamous VIP freezers. (Deep
is at the former site of the Brown Derby.)</LD>
<LD>   The Cool Cat and movie plot were Kane's brainchild. But when it
came to executing the idea, he teamed up with I2NET, the Huntington
Beach firm that developed his Web sites, on the $10,000 project.</LD>
<TE>   Freelance animator Mike Nawyn, 24, who likes hanging out at Deep,
spent 100 hours working on the project with Kane, the first project
of its kind for I2NET.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done animations for invitations before, but this is the
first time anybody's gone to this extent," said I2NET Vice President
Scott Capone. "It's a mini-movie."</TE>
<TE>   All of the Hollywood and Vine club's unique features, including
the erotic dancers in the one-way-mirrored glass boxes, are showcased
in the cartoon for the invitation-only bash.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's invite was an X-rated peek-a-boo box, complete with
its own flashlight and perverse instructions. Some guests received
last-minute reminders: a champagne bottle adorned in a pleather
corset.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're on the A-list in L.A., you get so many invitations you
just wind up tossing out," Kane said. "I strive to make mine
memorable. Last year, our invitation was dirty and sexy and fun.
Things get wild and crazy at Deep." So, what is the rating for Kane's
movie debut?</TE>
<TE>   "The freezer gives it the X-rating," Capone said. "If you take out
the freezer scene, we can go to an R. But for now, it's a soft X."</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly how Kane likes it.</TE>

<LD>The host of the Learning Channel's "While You Were Out" and singles
columnist for the Jewish Journal rarely stays in.</LD>
<LD>   This is paradise</LD>
<LD>   I live in Koreatown and that's like a two-minute drive to
Larchmont Village. And Larchmont is just paradise. I start every
Saturday there. First I go to Sam's Bagel's. I just love it. It's so
comforting--they know me, they know I want a plain bagel, cheese and
tomato. I have that, my coffee and my newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   Next I'll go to the Larchmont Beauty Supply--it's a cornucopia of
creams, candles and conditioners. Where else can you spend $50 and
come out and feel good all day? There's also a great little boutique
called Petticoats near there. They have great clothes, but they're a
little pricey. So when I find a dress I want, I visit it every week.
I stalk it and wait for it to go on sale. Then I buy it.</TE>
<TE>   Yoga and ...</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere on the weekend there's got to be some kind of workout. I
like to go to Bikram Yoga in Silver Lake. They turn the heat up to
105 degrees. I like Bikram because it smells good -- some don't. But
you leave Bikram and you're just euphoric. Oh, and I love to take a
walk in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. There's something about
walking by Douglas Fairbanks. My grandparents are in there.</TE>
<TE>   Pound of kittens</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorite things is to go to the Los Angeles City Pound
on 11th avenue near Crenshaw. I love animals, but because I travel I
can't really have another cat. So I go and I just pet their kittens.
I even applied for their foster care program--you know, where you
care for a sick kitten for a few weeks, but I got a rejection letter.
I said, "Oh my gosh! I was rejected by the city pound!"</TE>
<TE>   Hello, K-Town</TE>
<TE>   Like I said, I live in Koreatown. It's this great, undiscovered
place. But I'm single-handedly trying to introduce everyone to
Koreatown--I call it K-town. One of my favorite places there is BCD
Tofu House off of Wilshire. It's open 24 hours. I'm a vegetarian so I
get tofu-sizzling hot tofu with vegetables. Their tofu is like eating
silk.</TE>
<TE>   War of the curls</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown is the place for people who are at war with their curly
hair. Korean women are obsessed with straightening their hair. I
think it's a cultural thing. I'm Jewish with big, curly hair, so I go
to this Korean beauty shop, Kim Sun Young. They will straighten your
hair within an inch of its life--they pull it , blow-dry it ,
flat-iron it--I don't know what all for $20. Of course, no one speaks
English--I fit right in.</TE>
<TE>   Night times</TE>
<TE>   I have a lot of time because I have no dates. I write a singles
column for the Jewish Journal--it's not like Cary's column on "Sex
and the City." It's a little more philosophical. My column's filled
with all of the pain and suffering that's fit to print--I write about
my own travails.</TE>
<TE>   One thing I really like is the Other Network at Moomba on Friday
nights. They show failed television pilots and it's fun to be around
all of these creative people, celebrity types, people with big names
in the writing profession and it's nice to know that everyone's
failed. A martini will cost you $10 but it's worth it.</TE>

<LD>   A writer's nightmare</LD>
<LD>   Imagine the type of mind capable of creating a script like "Being
John Malkovich." Then load it with levels of neuroses and insecurity
that would make a reputable mental-health professional quiver, and
you've got a pretty good idea about the world of Charlie Kaufman as
depicted in the comedy "Adaptation." The film re-teams Kaufman with
"Malkovich" director Spike Jonze as Nicolas Cage plays the tortured
screenwriter (as well as his less-twisted, freeloading twin brother,
Donald) attempting to adapt Susan Orlean's nonfiction bestseller "The
Orchid Thief." The book-to-script transfer goes badly, but things get
even worse when Charlie (Cage) begins to stalk Orlean (Meryl Streep),
writes himself into the screenplay and seeks out screenwriting guru
Robert McKee (Brian Cox).</LD>
<TE>   "Adaptation," R for language, sexuality, some drug use and violent
images, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>

retrospective outside Japan in "Munakata Shiko: Japanese Master of
the Modern Print," opening today at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art. Munakata is celebrated as one of Japan's most significant modern
print artists of the 20th century. Extremely nearsighted, Munakata
became a woodblock printmaker and revolutionized the concept of the
woodblock print by creating large-sized pieces for screens and wall
murals. He used contemporary poetry, folk tales and Buddhist texts
for inspiration, often transforming them into his unique woodcuts,
ink paintings, calligraphy and ceramics.</TE>

<LD>   Early Kushner</LD>
<LD>   Before his epic "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's outrage over
1980s public indifference to the growing toll of AIDS led to his 1987
play, "A Bright Room Called Day." Set in 1932, it focuses on a
marginal group of Germans -- Jews, gays, artists and communists --
who can see darkness descending on them as Adolf Hitler and his Nazi
party ascend toward power. The play also jumps into the present,
depicting a young American woman who sees dark political forces at
play in her own time and place. This revival comes in a student-acted
and directed production from Cal State Fullerton's theater
department.</LD>
<TE>   "A Bright Room Called Day," Recital Hall, Cal State Fullerton
Performing Arts Center, Nutwood Avenue and State College Boulevard.
Opens Friday.Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.,

Overture to Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and Bizet's Symphony No. 1. He'll

<DH>Free your mind with tunes that are never the same twice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pop lovers of the world, unite! We have nothing to lose but our chain
stores. Waiting for the revolution we feel we deserve, we've endured
a lot of hyphenated references to the past -- neo-soul, post-punk,
nu-metal -- when a movement was fomenting right under our noses. It's
time to face the music: the only way to halt the commodification of
pop culture is to get free.</LD>
<LD>   Not free, as in it doesn't cost anything. Why deny the artist his
or her due? No, "free" as in free jazz: improvisation, music that is
never played the same way twice. We have to change the idea of the
"song."</LD>
<LD>   One of the places this idea has taken root is in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Musicians have acknowledged this problem for years. Recordings,
concerts, radio -- they're all a trap of endless repetition. The
trouble with pop songs is not, as many critics charge, that the
market is ruled by the tyranny of bad taste. If Celine Dion is your
bag, go on and live your life. It's not your fault that this act
tends to feed corporate control. It's the song's.</TE>
<TE>   From the very first time a song is heard in public, it becomes one
of the most jealously guarded works of art. Unlike painting or
sculpture, however, every copy is an original. Its value is measured
not by rarity, but by ubiquity. Still, our reverence verges on
fundamentalism. Despite tens of millions of copies, the song must
remain the same. And the more popular or important the song, the less
likely it is to change. Like "The Star-Spangled Banner." Or the Song
of Solomon. But, honestly, how many times can you "Get the Led Out"?
Can't we agree the Led was pretty well out by 1978? Now, it's only
making mega-media corporations rich, new artists discouraged and
consumers unmotivated to hear what's next.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we should start challenging the sanctity of the song. Jazz
has been out in front on this since Ornette Coleman blew the
(Western) world apart with his 1958 recordings "Something Else" and
"Tomorrow Is the Question." Sidestepping the efforts of John Coltrane
and Charles Mingus to play outside harmonic chord progressions,
Coleman opened the door to improvisation based on melodic and
rhythmic lines. It was a door that opened infinitely more doors.</TE>
<TE>   One writer described the sound as "a non-European folk survival --
direct and moving." Free jazz was born. Coleman is still popular
today without playing "hits," in fact, never playing much of the same
composition twice.</TE>
<TE>   What if all music was like this? Some L.A. bands have been asking
this question for years. Like Crater. Consisting of local virtuoso
drummer Scott Amendola, bassist Scott Sickafoos, guitar reinventor
Nels Cline and a mysterious Bay Area music software engineer named
JHNO, Crater plays rock- and electronica-based improv compositions
that are only lightly dipped in structure, and sometimes not even
that.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it is sublime music. Some of it sounds like rock, some
like '70s Miles Davis, and all of it sounds like Crater. Similarly,
Mike Watt's L.A. punk improv space-jam ensemble, Banyan, sounds like
none other. So, it is with any number of free jazz groups that appear
at the new Rocco's or the experimental electronica heard at the
Knitting Factory.</TE>
<TE>   Songs, it turns out, are not the key to identity. Imagine a radio
where everything was remixed automatically. Led Zeppelin would still
sound like Led Zeppelin, complete with lyrics about Middle Earth and
whatnot. But we'd finally strip away this idea that the song we know
is the only way it can be. It was never that way for the artist who
wrote it. We could then stop storing things like museum pieces and
start living music again.</TE>
<TE>   Dance music is already deep into this idea. Live experience now
needs to inform the rest of the industry. Even a touch of improv
might signal the end of formats, playlists and the endless
repackaging that turns good songs bad. Full-blown free music empowers
musicians and weakens record companies. Under this regime, recordings
would exist just to drive people to live shows, where every night
would be a happening because a new version of every song would debut.
All of pop culture would be affected: The CDs, DVDs and videogames
that now keep us home-boundwould give way to night life. Are you
ready to break your addiction to the song and get free? Crater is
waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Crater played the Temple Bar on Wednesday night as part of a tour
that moves on to Petaluma tonight, then San Francisco and Santa Cruz.
The band will be back in the area soon.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waylon Jennings and Collin Raye did it. Keb' Mo, Harry Connick Jr.
and Dom DeLuise have done it. John Lithgow has made it a part-time
occupation. It seems to have become almost obligatory for artists to
make at least one kids' album.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Zanes, former lead singer of the high-profile, gritty 1980s
Del Fuegos rock band, however, crossed over and stayed. "I feel like
I found my calling," the raspy-voiced rocker said, "but it found me,
really."</LD>
<LD>   Zanes' first children's album, "Rocket Ship Beach," was released
in 2000 to high praise in the national media; it was followed by the
well-received "Family Dance" and the recent release "Night Time!,"
all on Zanes' Festival Five Records label.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday and Sunday, his "Dan Zanes and Friends" family concert
tour goes to the La Jolla Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Crafting songs with kids in mind "was daunting to think about,"
Zanes said. "But the well had run dry as far as writing songs about
my old girlfriends went, and eventually, things started coming up.
It's been very freeing."</TE>
<TE>   Parenthood, as so often happens, was the catalyst for change.
Browsing the children's sections in record stores after the birth of
his daughter Anna, now 8, Zanes was disappointed to find that much of
what was available was TV- or movie-related. He was looking for
something specific: Call it a 21st century take on traditional folk
music with an informal, communal feel. He wanted "updated versions of
the music I grew up with -- Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly,
Ella Jenkins -- records that sound like someone made them in their
house."</TE>
<TE>   He began to make his own "handmade" music, music that would work
for adults without losing children. The result has been playful,
often wistful songs of shared experiences and Americana, about thrift
shops, Ferris wheels, fireflies and neighborhood idylls.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought things had to have this kind of edge to them,"
Zanes said. "Now I'm just trying to write about things that are
meaningful to me."</TE>
<TE>   Fired, too, with a desire to help keep older tunes alive for
another generation, Zanes added American pop standards and
multicultural folk songs to his mix. He found a warm, familial sound
in his Brooklyn home that doubles as a recording studio, with an
eclectic group of professional and nonprofessional friends.</TE>
<TE>   These include assorted children; the "Sandy Girls," West Indian
nannies who taught him songs of their childhood and are featured with
him on each album; as well as professional artists such as Barbara
Brousal and Father Goose (a.k.a. Rankin' Dan); the Latino hip-hop
Rubi Theater Company; and such drop-in guest singers as Suzanne Vega,
Aimee Mann, Sheryl Crow and Sandra Bernhard.</TE>
<TE>   Zanes no longer keeps his distance from the audience. His concerts
are as much dance party as sing-along.</TE>
<TE>   "Dancing and singing cover such a range of entertainment and
communal activity," he said, "and that's been the real pleasure: The
wall that used to exist between my old band and the audiences is no
longer there, and we do everything we can to keep it from ever being
there again. The more it's like a little Grateful Dead show, the
happier I am.</TE>
<TE>   "Making music together is a fundamental way that we connect with
each other. It brings people together; TV doesn't, computers don't."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that grown-ups as well as children pick up on that. "It
doesn't take much and it's fun, getting together with your friends,
playing a couple of tunes with your family," Zanes said.</TE>
<TE>   No one is more surprised than Zanes at the "funny little twist"
his life has taken. "I feel that I have more to give doing this than
I ever had doing rock 'n' roll, and musically I'm more satisfied than
I ever was."</TE>

<HD>'The Hours' earns season's first nod</HD>
<DH>The Board of Review also honors Campbell Scott and Julianne
Moore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race leading to Oscar gold began Wednesday when "The Hours,"
director Stephen Daldry's poignant drama based on Michael
Cunningham's novel, which was itself based on Virginia Woolf's "Mrs.
Dalloway," was named best picture of 2002 by the National Board of
Review of Motion Pictures. The Paramount release, which stars Meryl
Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore, opens Dec. 27.</LD>
<LD>   The first organization to announce its picks for best of the year,
the National Board of Review is made up of educators, writers, film
historians and film students.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the group chose "Moulin Rouge" as best picture, and it
went on to be nominated for numerous Academy Awards. Its best actress
last year, Halle Berry, won the Oscar for "Monster's Ball," as did
supporting actor Jim Broadbent for "Iris."</LD>
<TE>   The board selected dark horse Campbell Scott as best actor for his
role as a cynical New York advertising executive who learns about
love from his nephew in the independent film "Roger Dodger." Scott
beat out such favorites as Jack Nicholson for "About Schmidt" and
Michael Caine for "The Quiet American." Scott's father, the late
George C. Scott, won the best actor accolade from the board 32 years
ago for "Patton."</TE>
<TE>   Julianne Moore was named best actress for her performance as a
'50s housewife who discovers her husband is gay in Todd Haynes' lush
melodrama "Far From Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cooper was named best supporting actor for his performance
as an eccentric orchid thief in the comedy "Adaptation," and Kathy
Bates won best supporting actress for her colorful free spirit in the
comedy-drama "About Schmidt."</TE>
<TE>   Australian Philip Noyce picked up best director honors for two
films currently in release, "The Quiet American," based on Graham
Greene's 1955 novel, and "Rabbit-Proof Fence," a drama about the
Australian government's forcible removal of mixed-race aboriginal
children from their families.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Kaufman was named screenwriter of the year for
"Adaptation," "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and "Human Nature."</TE>
<TE>   Best documentary honors went to Michael Moore's controversial
"Bowling for Columbine," while Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away" from
Japan took best animated feature. Rob Marshall was honored as best
directorial debut for the musical "Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her" was named best foreign film.</TE>
<TE>   The cast of the upcoming version of "Nicholas Nickleby" won honors
for best acting by an ensemble. Derek Luke won for breakthrough
performance in Denzel Washington's "Antwone Fisher," which will be
released later this month; Maggie Gyllenhaal won the corresponding
actress nod for "Secretary."</TE>
<TE>   Honorees will receive their awards Jan. 14 in New York City.</TE>

<LD>Hot Property: Writer-director Justin Tanner's first Los Angeles
premiere in four years is generally hilarious and representative of
its author's distinctive voice. Like many Tanner works, "Property"
transpires in present-day Los Angeles at the Beachwood Canyon
apartment of protagonist Brett (Matt Huhn). The premise pits veteran
99-seat theater actor Brett against drugs, colleagues, the heartless
Industry and, above all, his visiting family, yet another
dysfunctional Tanner brood. Few writers can rival Tanner's insight
into this milieu, and his skill at authentic characterizations and
invective remains matchless.</LD>

<LD>It was billed as a lineup of "buzz bands" by a corporate sponsor, but
Tuesday's assortment of rock at the House of Blues generated more of
a low hum.</LD>
<LD>   Though the club was virtually empty for Nickelback discovery
Theory of a Deadman, there was a core group of followers on hand to
take in Audiovent's raw, grandiose sounds.</LD>
<LD>   Memphis, Tenn.-bred Saliva, the band most worthy of the "buzz"
moniker after the success of its 2001 debut album, "Every Six
Seconds," gave the room a needed shot of adrenaline, with catchy,
groove-laden numbers from that album and its latest, "Back Into Your
System."</LD>
<TE>   Synchronized torso-bobbing animated the black-clad quintet's
gloomy stew of rap, rock and riffs, and though the presentation
wasn't terribly original, the songs were strong and infectious, a
seamless mix of passionate melody and noisy belligerence. Burly lead
singer Josey Scott has a likable, tough-yet-tender charm that
translates well whether he's busting out angry raps about 9/11 or
crooning about the complexities of love.</TE>

<LD>"Griffith Park: It's central to L.A." (Nov. 28) was a comprehensive
guide, but didn't mention one of the most wonderful places in this
L.A. oasis: Shane's Inspiration, a "boundless" playground -- the
first of its kind in California -- where disabled children can play
side-by-side with their able-bodied peers.</LD>
<LD>   The playground, which opened two years ago near the
merry-go-round, is named in honor of a little boy named Shane who
died as an infant from spinal muscular atrophy.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the play structures are universally accessible, meaning
children don't have to leave their wheelchairs, braces or other
support devices to play.</LD>
<TE>   The best part? During playground planning sessions, local disabled
children said that special equipment would be nice, but what they
wanted most of all was to play with other kids.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what you'll see at this inspiring playground.</TE>

<LD>   Thailand Plaza is known for live entertainment (from opera singers
to Elvis Presley impersonators) as well as food. Its generous portion
of pad Thai begins with stir-fried chicken, shrimp, egg and tofu,
then sticky rice noodles are added and the sauce, made from tamarind,
sugar, fish sauce and the chef's secret: shrimp paste. It's garnished
with freshly roasted ground peanuts, bean sprouts and Thai lettuce.</LD>
<LD>   (Pad Thai, $7.95.) Thailand Plaza Restaurant, 2nd floor, 5321
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 993-9000.</LD>

<TE>   The omelet comes first</TE>
<TE>   Saladang Song starts with a paper-thin omelet, and the rest of the
ingredients are assembled on top of it: the rice noodles, the sauteed
tofu, shrimp and chicken, the sauce (sugar and tamarind with a pinch
of paprika for color) and the bean sprouts, roasted peanuts and
chopped green onions. The dish comes loosely wrapped in the egg
crepe.</TE>

<TE>   Bangkok Four at South Coast Plaza makes Bangkok-style pad Thai.
First, egg, shrimp and chicken are stir-fried; then rice noodles are
added along with lime juice, fish sauce, rice vinegar and sugar. The
bean sprouts and ground peanuts go on once this is all tossed
together, and the dish is garnished with extra bean sprouts. If you
like it spicy, they'll add some crushed peppers to the sauce.</TE>

<HD>In step with the offbeat</HD>
<DH>Playing the mysterious girl in 'Morvern Callar' came easily
to the musically inclined Samantha Morton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sorina Diaconescu</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the upcoming film rendition of Alan Warner's 1995 novel "Morvern
Callar," Samantha Morton plays the enigmatic title character: a quiet
girl with a boyfriend who slits his wrists on Christmas day and
bequeaths her a finished novel and the gift of a mix tape.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of this poetic, often beautiful, film unfolds with the
music on that tape, letting the emotional content of the songs inform
us about the emotional state of the mysterious girl. Both the premise
and the character are deeply revealing for the eccentric Morton, 25,
an up-and-coming British actress whose predilection for quirky roles
is now morphing into star power in such films as "Sweet and Lowdown"
and "Minority Report."</LD>
<LD>   Like the girl in the film, she is devoted to her music. She
bridges the gap between the strangeness of acting and the strangeness
of being Samantha Morton by listening to the music.</LD>
<TE>   In the film, she smokes and grooves to the hypnotic sounds of Can,
an experimental electronic group from the early '70s. A pivotal scene
finds her leaning over the bathtub, kitchen knife in hand, in a pose
of surreal beauty scored by the dulcet, trippy Velvet Underground
ditty "I'm Sticking With You."</TE>
<TE>   And when Morvern strides across the floor of the supermarket where
she stocks produce, the headphones stuck under her red wool hat play
the Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra duet "Some Velvet Morning,"
instantly infusing the mundane landscape with otherworldly grace and
strangeness.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborators have used similar words to describe the star of the
film herself. Morton has "something not quite of this earth,"
"Morvern Callar" director Lynne Ramsay recently told Britain's
Guardian. On screen, her physical appearance is a mix of ethereal
beauty and coltish charm: a round child's face and a wide forehead
that suggest sincerity, translucent skin often stained rosy with
tears, big blue eyes difficult to interpret, lips easily bruised with
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   She has worked with directors from Steven Spielberg (who cast her
as a precognitive psychic in his futuristic dystopia "Minority
Report") and Woody Allen to Jim Sheridan, and she recently won a best
actress British Independent Film Award for Morvern, a role she
developed with the help of the soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't do my job without music," Morton said recently in a phone
interview from London, where she lives. "When I'm in character, it
does feel like a dance sometimes, even if I'm not moving, even if I'm
as still as ... you know, death; it's still a dance. It sounds very
pretentious," she added with proper British self-deprecation, "but I
interpret most characters through music."</TE>
<TE>   "With 'Morvern Callar' it was easier for me to have an opportunity
to listen to music while acting, as opposed to listening to music
before the scene and then having to take off my headphones, as I
normally do."</TE>
<TE>   This particular affinity for informing her performances through
music cues has been apparent in almost all of her work.</TE>
<TE>   In "Jesus' Son," she seduced the protagonist by shaking her bits
to Tommy Roe's early '70s bubblegum pop "Sweet Pea." As Hattie, the
mute Depression-era laundress from "Sweet and Lowdown," her face lit
up when her boyfriend Emmet Ray -- a kleptomaniac who was also the
second-best jazz guitar player in the world -- casually strummed his
guitar after they made love. Her performance in that film as a kind
of lovely female Harpo Marx earned her an Oscar nomination. For the
awards ceremony she donned a Sex Pistols T-shirt. She even played a
mermaid in U2's latest video, "Electrical Storm."</TE>
<TE>   Last month she DJd a music set for London radio station XFM. She
volunteered that the track list "will give you a good insight into
who I am."</TE>
<TE>   If that's true, what do we know about Samantha Morton? She often
takes off in the psychedelic funk rocket of the Stone Roses' "Fools
Gold." She loves to swim in the melancholy of Joy Division's "She's
Lost Control." She thinks, as Saint Etienne put it, that "Only Love
Can Break Your Heart." And she is, simply, the Beatles' "Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Given her predilection for using music as an emotional tool,
"Morvern Callar" was a natural.</TE>
<TE>   Morton fell in love with Morvern when she read the book several
years ago. She lobbied resolutely with Ramsay for the part of the
English girl living in a bleak seaside Scottish town who is
determined to waltz through life according to her own, apparently
random motives -- secretly disposing of the body of her boyfriend,
passing his novel to literary agents as her own, using the money
earmarked for his funeral to fund a vacation to Spain with her best
friend. Through it all, the music serves as a kind of road map to the
inner life of a protagonist who remains inscrutable throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Her impulses, however, have a universal appeal, said Morton: "It's
that feeling of wanting to get away from what society has given you,
from all that you're supposedly meant to live up to."</TE>
<TE>   Even after portraying Morvern on screen, the actress said she has
yet to really puzzle her out. She tries to avoid analyzing a
character before or after shooting a movie. "I just be it," Morton
said simply. "I went much of the film like everybody else, receiving
her. It was like breathing, almost doing nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's over -- I have played other characters since then --
and I really miss her. I'd love to make 'Morvern Callar 2.' But I
don't think it will ever happen."</TE>
<TE>   Morton grew up in Nottingham in a large Polish-Irish family, her
childhood marked by poverty and emotional turmoil. When she was 12,
casting directors spotted her at the Central Junior Television
Workshop, an after-school drama club where she was training, and
offered her parts in TV shows. She dropped out of school at 16 and
moved to London to embark on a full-time career as an actress.</TE>
<TE>   Her first important film role came in 1997. Critics hailed her
breakout performance as a young woman who embarks on wild sexual
escapades as a means to cope with her mother's death in Carine
Adler's "Under the Skin."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent collaborations with women filmmakers -- Alison Maclean
in "Jesus' Son" and Ramsay in "Morvern Callar" -- proved equally
auspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay, a Glaswegian filmmaker from a working-class background,
has only two features under her belt but has already cut a swath as
one of Scotland's visionary young artists. "She's someone who
inspires me greatly," said Morton. "Lynne is a beautiful woman, a
very sexy woman, very confident about herself. And that is very
infectious. Being around her makes you feel powerful in your own
species."</TE>
<TE>   The actress has made films in Israel, Spain and Britain but does
not see her future confined to European indies. "I really enjoyed
working in Hollywood," she said. "I would go back there in a
heartbeat, but it just has to be the right project."</TE>
<TE>   What would be the right project for one of the film world's most
evasive characters? A strong feminist statement? A descent into the
heart of pop culture? More work about difficult or troubled women? As
it turns out, yes on all accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to do an ensemble piece," she says, "maybe 'Charlie's
Angels.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 5-foot-tall obutsudan, or Buddhist altar, faces you upon entering
the exhibition "Crafting History: Arts and Crafts from America's
Concentration Camps," now at the Japanese American National Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Meticulously carved out of honey-colored wood, it's a small-scale
rendition of the facade of a Buddhist temple, with its elaborate
bracketed roof, lotus emblems and decorated columns. Inside, three
sections contain miniature scrolls -- a calligraphy in the center and
portraits of monks on either side.</LD>
<LD>   The craftsmanship is splendid enough, but the fact that it was
made while brothers Shinzaburo and Gentaro Nishiura were incarcerated
in Heart Mountain, Wyo., during World War II is more surprising
still.</LD>
<TE>   Under the direction of the War Relocation Authority, they were
among the 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent removed from the West
Coast to 10 internment camps in isolated areas of the United States
-- to prevent possible "collaboration" with America's declared enemy,
Japan. While the other 400 objects in the show are more modest in
scale and purpose, they also reflect an important part of this
unfortunate history.</TE>
<TE>   Living communally and crowded into basic barracks, the Japanese
Americans had to make do with limited food and supplies. Still, they
proved resourceful in "making things to create a home environment,"
says museum curator Kristine Kim. In addition to producing items for
everyday use they also found ways to express artistic inclinations.</TE>
<TE>   The objects were selected from the museum's own collection, begun
in 1988, and donations from the camp era are still pouring in as
people realize the importance of preserving these artifacts. The
obutsudan was received just two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we can tell, it's been in use almost continuously since
World War II," says Kim. The Nishiuras were professional woodworkers,
having worked on the Japanese Pavilion for the 1915 Panama Pacific
International Exhibition in San Francisco. After the war, they gave
the altar to the San Jose Buddhist Church, which later transferred it
to the Gilroy Buddhist Community Hall, which in turn donated it to
the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the objects come with such a detailed history.
"Unfortunately, part of the story is lost," says Kim. "This is about
preserving the story we can."</TE>
<TE>   And that story is told by the exhibition through objects,
photographs and text. This includes a number of drawings and
paintings; art classes were offered at all the camps by those who had
had academic or professional training before the war. Artist Chiura
Obata, for example, had taught at UC Berkeley, and during internment
he set up art schools at Tanforan and Topaz. In the exhibition, his
ink painting shows two adults and a child standing rather forlornly
in the bleak terrain of their camp. Like other adults, he depicted
the world he saw around him.</TE>
<TE>   There are also dozens of carvings, canes, wall plaques, and pieces
of furniture made out of found and scrap wood. In the same gallery is
a strikingly chic olive-green woman's suit made by Hatsumi Shohara;
the two-piece is entirely crocheted, down to the three "bows"
decorating the front.</TE>
<TE>   In a world in which there were no flowers, the internees made
their own. To continue such traditions as bonsai and flower
arrangement, they fashioned plants out of paper and shells. Visitor
Alyson Iwamoto, an art teacher, was especially touched by the
flowers. "They couldn't find a single flower around them, so they
crafted them," she says. "It's so admirable. They didn't allow their
spirits to be broken, whatever the circumstances."</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT TENGU</KH>
<HD>Flight school</HD>
<DH>Sake tasting takes off in an 'enlightening' program in
Westwood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ARE you ready to fly? Here, at the trendy Tengu in Westwood, where a
DJ spins funky music while you dine on superb sushi and other divine
culinary treats, it is quite possible to feel like you've taken off
if you indulge in one or more of the restaurant's seven sake flights.</LD>
<LD>   From New York to San Francisco to Los Angeles, thrill-seekers and
connoisseurs are engaging in the latest cosmopolitan drink
experience. Similar to wine tasting and beer sampling, sake flights
offer a way to try the rice-based beverage that is made like beer but
tastes like wine.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great thing to do if you don't know anything about sake
and you want to learn," said Alon Ravid, Tengu's bar manager. "Or if
you just want to have a good time with your friends."</LD>
<TE>   Which is exactly what Brenda Mendoza, 29, of Pasadena, who has
tried all seven flights, had in mind. "It was very enlightening ... I
didn't know there were so many types of sake, like tequila," she
said. "I really enjoyed the fruit-flavored ones. The infused litchi
is the best. If you're interested in sampling different drinks,
whether you're a wine lover or tequila drinker, sake flights are
another way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Served in three square, 2-ounce shot glasses, each sake flight
offers a taste of several styles of sake or different flavors of a
particular style. The new Tengu Sake Flight Program includes three
main categories of premium sake: Junmai, Ginjo and Daiginjo, as well
as nontraditional fruit-flavored and fruit-infused sakes, the house
special.</TE>
<TE>   All of these sakes are filtered and clear in appearance. But the
difference lies in the percentage of the rice grain that has been
polished, Ravid said. The more polished the grain, the more floral or
fruity the sake will be; the less polished, the drier the sake.</TE>
<TE>   Premium sake, which can be compared to fine wine, is served cold
and sipped. At Tengu, sake drinkers can choose from five flights that
include combinations of three different brands in one of the Junmai,
Ginjo or Daiginjo categories; or flights that include sampling one of
each category. For those with sweeter or more adventurous taste buds,
there are two fruity flights, which include the restaurant's house
drink, the infused pineapple sake or the popular infused litchi sake
that tastes like honeydew.</TE>
<TE>   Chef Carlos Mulia, formerly of Wolfgang Puck Cafe in Beverly
Hills, Border Grill in Santa Monica and Splash in Malibu, offers an
Omakase (chef's choice) menu in which the day's best dishes are
paired with the sake or wine that best complements the flavor.
Traditionally, an Omakase menu consists of the best of the sushi bar,
but since 70% of Tengu's menu is hot, Mulia serves both.</TE>
<TE>   A sample Omakase menu includes: Asian tartar, roasted beet salad,

<HD>At last, Newman is back in 'Town'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Phillips</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Nobody very remarkable ever come out of it, s'far as we know," says
the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," speaking of
Grover's Corners. No matter how off-the-cuff the actor delivers it,
the line sounds like a lie. This is, after all, Paul Newman up there,
whose remarkableness -- easygoing star charisma incarnate, here
sporting a cardigan and specs -- makes the fictional Protestant
Republican burg a mighty glamorous place indeed.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Newman played Broadway was in a 1964 romantic comedy
called "Baby Want a Kiss." Nobody remembers much about it, except
that it starred Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward.</LD>
<LD>   Now Newman has returned, wearing an air of humble authority like a
second cardigan, in a revival of Wilder's 1938 play. It originated
earlier this year at the Westport Country Playhouse, where Woodward
is artistic director.</LD>
<TE>   It is a curious and bittersweet experience, in ways only partly
related to the curious bittersweetness of Wilder's classic. If you do
it right, "Our Town" can -- and should -- be more troubling than most
interpretations favor. Newman notwithstanding, director James
Naughton's rendition is coyly hearty in its comedy and predictable in
its pathos. Too many of the performances lack the ease and texture of
what Wilder self-consciously labeled his first act: daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Everything Newman does, and doesn't do, contrasts with a general
impulse to "explain" the play's moods and themes. For a famously
no-scenery play, designer Tony Walton has served up an awful lot of
scenery. In a gently expressive (albeit heavily amplified) voice,
Newman lays out the facts about Wilder's town. The Stage Manager's
lecture, in director Naughton's weirdly literal staging, becomes an
illustrated lecture, with slide projections.</TE>
<TE>   Newman later scores some large laughs -- with a sharp hand-clap,
he delivers the line about being 21 or 22 and "then whisssh! you're
70" -- but in the main, he does nothing to call attention to himself.
This is a doggedly plain-spoken performance.</TE>
<TE>   The other principals are played by seasoned performers, although
you never believe these people live in the same town. Frank Converse
portrays Doc Gibbs like a 19th century ham actor; for a guy who's
getting only three hours' sleep a night, he's boisterous as all
get-out. Jane Curtin's Mrs. Webb nails plenty of the humor, although
her dialect sounds as if it's coming from a New York City borough yet
to be discovered. The young lovers, Emily Webb (Maggie Lacey) and
George Gibbs (Ben Fox), look right but carry more than a touch of
cuteness and archness. Only Jayne Atkinson's flinty Mrs. Gibbs feels
at home in Wilder's universe.</TE>
<TE>   Most contemporary productions of "Our Town" tend to be dominated
by the town's most visibly unhappy resident, the suicidal alcoholic
choir director Simon Stimson, played here by Stephen Spinella in an
extreme but effective turn. The play tends to work better, though,
when Stimson isn't the sole disrupted soul in Grover's Corners. I'm
not saying it should be a town full of neurotics, but everyone in the
play is guilty of casual, everyday slights or blind spots, of living
near or around but not in the moment. Wilder is quite clear on this,
when the recently deceased Emily returns to her 12th birthday and
cannot see it through a second time.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1988 Lincoln Center production, Gregory Mosher directed a
blessedly unsentimental "Our Town." That production was the virtual
opposite of this one; Mosher's Stage Manager was Spalding Gray, the
show's one drawback, aggravatingly stiff and snarling. In contrast,
Newman, in his economical fashion, plays the material right down the
middle while his colleagues mug and grin their way through the
ritualistic passages of courtship, marriage, milk delivery, what have
you. Have these actors been to New Hampshire? Where's the stoicism,
of the cold, of everyday ordinary activity? Even smart folks such as
Jeffery DeMunn (Editor Webb) are popping their eyes and overstressing
gags.</TE>
<TE>   Not Newman. Although it's somewhat frustrating that the
performance doesn't have a bit more spark, it's not nearly as
frustrating as the rest of the show. Wilder once wrote that the
problem with popular theater was its aim only to be "soothing." This
is a soothing, and sadly limited, take on a deceptively simple play.</TE>

<HD>His new spin on things</HD>
<DH>Ben Watt makes the rare move from pop star to in-demand DJ.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Romero</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It only involves two turntables and good old vinyl, but crossing over
into DJ culture isn't so easy. Just ask former porn star Tracy Lords,
who tanked as a rave jock, or karma-chameleon DJ Boy George, who has
been criticized for his iffy mixing skills. The UK's Ben Watt is a
rare outside success: He's thriving as a DJ despite having been
behind Everything But the Girl's love-it-or-hate-it 1995 pop anthem
"Missing" ("like the deserts miss the rain"), which later found its
way into the popular nervous system through "Saturday Night Live's"
Mango as it also became a No. 2 hit stateside.</LD>
<LD>   His reverence for house music, his headfirst dive into the scene
and his perseverance (it's been six years since his decision to
eschew traditional pop instruments in favor of Technics 1200s) have
transformed Watt, 40, into a hero to hard-to-please house heads. In
fact, spinning with DJ partner Jay Hannan at their own Lazy Dog
nights in London and touring in support of the duo's second mix-CD,
"Lazy Dog Volume 2," Watt has become a guiding light for deep,
tasteful dance music and a defender of the DJ-as-musician.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether you're spinning records or playing guitars, you have to
take your audience on a journey and have them feel what you feel,"
says Watt. "Until I started deejaying, I never realized the intimacy
you have with an audience."</LD>
<TE>   It was a phone call in 1994 from members of Massive Attack that
sent Everything But the Girl on a new path, taking the duo and
longtime couple from "lite jazz" to e-music stardom as partner Tracey
Thorn placed her delicate vocals above the trip-hoppers' lush,
emotional title track, "Protection."</TE>
<TE>   "That reawakened interest in Everything But the Girl and
re-energized Tracey's voice," Watt says.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering from a rare autoimmune disease, Watt was encouraged by
legendary British producer Howie B to hit the decks. He began
spinning drum-and-bass and the kind of Brazilian- and jazz-flavored
down-tempo that brought him and Tracy together in the first place in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started in the '80s, the London scene was into that whole
soul-jazz-bossa sound," Watt says. "It really influenced people like
Sade and EBTG."</TE>
<TE>   Watt paired up with Hannan, an accomplished BBC and KISS-FM jock
and house head who ran UK promotion for Chicago label Guidance. By
the end of the '90s, Lazy Dog was giving a smooth, New York feel to
tracks by Sade, Maxwell, Meshell N'degeocello and even EBTG's own
"Tracey In My Room," a heartfelt redux of 1996's "Wrong" that frames
Thorn's voice with gorgeous guitar and lush synth washes.</TE>
<TE>   While Thorn remains in "semiretirement" tending to the couple's
children, Watt tends to his duties as co-owner of London nightspot
Cherry Red, does production work (including much of Beth Orton's
latest, "Daybreaker") and continues to rinse house that is "really
deep, epic and sweet," to put it in his words. For Watt, music is
revolutionary, not evolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   As he once wrote, in a 1998 house classic from Deep Dish featuring
EBTG, "The future of the future will still repeat today." " 'Future
of the Future' tried to capture that feeling that you won't be helped
out by your past and the expectations people have of you," says Watt.
"You're going to go out into the night regardless of what people
say."</TE>

<HD>Ignore the rumors: Maldita's not dead -- just diversified</HD>
<DH>Members of the seminal Latin rock band are too busy to
notice they've drifted a bit from the public eye.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ernesto Lechner</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NOTHING is quite what it seems in the enigmatic, eccentric world of
Maldita Vecindad. The band put rock en espanol on the map with one of
the biggest-selling albums ever released in Mexico, "El Circo," then
hasn't put out an album since 1998's genre-bender "Mostros." It's
been superseded by newer arrivals such as Molotov, El Gran Silencio
and the Nortec Collective.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the very existence of the seminal Mexico City rock group
has been the subject of speculation.</LD>
<LD>   But the members of Maldita Vecindad have been hardly aware of this
drift -- still together, they've been too busy with dozens of solo
projects to get to a new album.</LD>
<TE>   "Taking a sabbatical is healthy for a band that has been together
for over 15 years," explains Maldita's lead singer, who goes only by
Roco, from his home in Mexico City. "Otherwise, you run the danger of
becoming a merchant instead of an artist."</TE>
<TE>   The vast array of Maldita projects includes forays into
electronica, children's music, production work and even cultural
journalism (the band's drummer, known only as Pancho, writes a weekly
column for the Mexican newspaper Reforma). Roco's stint as a DJ
sounds particularly intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the 'DJ' term, though," he is quick to say. "I
prefer the word sonidero -- the almighty maker of sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Humorously titled "Cyber Pachucote Sound System," Roco's DJ sets,
which he has presented in Mexico and the U.S., emphasize the cultural
schizophrenia and voracious love of music that define Maldita's
aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "I mix up Perez Prado with James Brown, Tigres del Norte with Fela
Kuti and gypsy music from Hungary," he says gleefully. "I guess
that's what we've always tried to do with Maldita anyway. Cramming
all those different styles into one song."</TE>
<TE>   This eclecticism proved to be not only a hallmark of the
alternative-flavored rock en espanol movement, but also exceedingly
popular. The band's 1991 classic, "El Circo," sold an amazing 600,000
copies.</TE>
<TE>   Maldita's early success was instrumental in creating the lexicon
of Latin rock by blending foreign styles such as ska, reggae and punk
with indigenous ranchera, mambo, cumbia and Mexican banda music.</TE>
<TE>   It's been four years since the Mexican quintet released the
kaleidoscopic, world-beat-friendly, Michael Brook-produced "Mostros"
-- and subsequently severed ties with its longtime label, BMG Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Having become something of a super-productive cipher, the quintet
now plans to create its own label and release future albums
independently.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that we haven't received a huge amount of recognition
from the Latin music industry," Roco says without a hint of
bitterness in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Then again, the music industry is not a cultural academy. It's
driven by commercial interests.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, I feel that Maldita has been recognized and
honored by the Latin rock movement itself," he adds. "I feel deeply
moved by the fact that we keep meeting emerging bands that name us
openly as an important influence -- like the whole Los Angeles
Chicano rock wave." He pauses for a moment, then adds: "That's where
we belong, really. In the streets. We're engaged in a never-ending
dialogue with the heart of this movement."</TE>

<LD>Peter B. Lewis, chairman of the board of trustees at the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum in New York City, has given the institution a gift
of $12 million, but only after its director agreed to reduce the
budget for 2003, the New York Times reports.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis said he had threatened museum director Thomas Krens with
dismissal if he didn't do more to stem the flow of red ink. Krens
responded with a budget of $24 million, down about 13% from last year
and 50% from 1999. Lewis' donation will be used to pay off debts.</LD>
<LD>   Plans for a Frank Gehry-designed branch of the Guggenheim in
downtown Manhattan have been put on hold.</LD>

<HD>Filmmaker takes daring look at gay life in China</HD>
<DH>The poignant and surprisingly frank 'Enter the Clowns'
embraces humanity in all its forms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cui Zi'en's "Enter the Clowns" is a groundbreaker in gay cinema as
well as in Chinese independent filmmaking. Adapted from his own novel
by Cui, a controversial Beijing Film Academy professor, this
beautifully shot-in-digital film unfolds as a series of interlocked
vignettes revealing the everyday lives of young Beijing gay and
transgender men. In their exploration of sexuality, they struggle to
link emotions and desire more freely and matter-of-factly than one
might expect in the communist nation. Screening Saturday at 7:30
p.m., "Enter the Clowns" is featured in the concluding weekend of the
UCLA Film Archives' provocative "New Chinese Cinema" series at
Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater.</LD>
<LD>   The film has terrific immediacy, and while some moments recall a
Warhol-like spirit of spontaneity and others his tediousness, the
film has a winning quality of being lived rather than acted. Its
seven-minute opening sequence is at once tender, startling and
erotic, yet poignant. In extreme close-up we see a handsome youth
(Xiao Bo) caring for his dying father, played by Cui and glimpsed
only briefly. The father says, "Call me Mom" as his son helps him
apply makeup. The vignette's conclusion recalls the daring and
discretion of Louis Malle's "Murmur of the Heart" (1971).</LD>
<TE>   The impact of this scene is hard to match, but numerous others
come close, especially a long sequence in a which a high school-age
youth pays an initially indifferent young man to hear his story. The
boy spills his guilt and confusion over having rejected his best
friend's sexual overtures only to reject him again after the friend
had been surgically transformed into a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Enter the Clowns" embraces humanity in its infinite variety --
and seeming absurdity -- and its capacity for experiencing joy,
anguish and pain, often simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the recent demolition of Roger Corman's old Venice
studio, a group of young filmmakers made one last film there in an
affectionate homage to Corman's exploitation pictures that launched
so many careers. The result is the fast and funny bloodbath
"Slaughter Studios," which opens a Friday and Saturday midnight run
at the Sunset 5.</TE>
<TE>   A pretentious video auteur (Peter Stanovich) rounds up a small
cast and crew, who break into the spooky, long-closed Slaughter
Studios to shoot a silly horror picture in which five Playboy
centerfold-types on a camping trip are menaced by a giant green
mantis. No sooner does Stanovich call, "Action!" than one person
after another meets a gory fate. Cleverly written by Dan Acre and
John Huckert, "Slaughter Studios" is a showcase for director-editor
Brian Katkin and cinematographer John Matkowsky, who go for broke
with a torrent of dynamically composed and structured images that's
exactly what this genre spoof requires to pull it off.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dating in Los Angeles can make you feel like you're just spinning
your wheels, but these days spinning my wheels is actually getting me
somewhere.</LD>
<LD>   At least four times a week, I find myself in a dim, sweaty room
where the music pumps so loud the walls sometimes vibrate. We ride
stationary bikes during one-hour challenges that take us up and down
hills, through intense interval jumps, and endurance tests.</LD>
<LD>   In the fitness world, this form of exercise is called spinning,
and different people do it for different reasons. For one, it's a
fabulous calorie-burner and a fun, fast way to get your cardio
workout. It's also a great training tool for serious cyclists.</LD>
<TE>   But the more I do it, and I've been at this for nearly a year, I'm
finding that my heart is getting a different kind of workout in this
Gold's Gym in Venice, space I share with people of all ages and from
all walks of life. As I climb hills and sprint, Eminem blasting in my
ears, my heart is strengthening. But not just in the athletic way you
would expect.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning works something like yoga. By focusing on the physical,
your spirit benefits as your soul is enriched and your heart expands.
You could argue that all exercise improves the mind and body, and it
does. But there's something different about taking your body to its
limits in the hot darkness, thunderous songs beating behind the
soothing voice of an instructor urging you to push yourself -- but,
most of all, to care for yourself.</TE>
<TE>   When Chris, our adorable instructor, tells us to embrace our
anxiety and stop fighting it, he's not just talking about the
seven-minute intervals on a hill on which we're about to embark, he's
talking about the things we combat every day in Los Angeles: traffic,
competition, rejection.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good lesson in all of life, isn't it?" he says one
evening. "Sometimes we need intensity. But sometimes we need to hold
back, too. If you peaked early today, learn from that. Sometimes we
need to hold back and that's the toughest thing to do. We cannot live
each day with that much intensity."</TE>
<TE>   It's the same reason Mike, another handsome spin master,
challenges us to cycle with our eyes closed so that we can't see even
the shadows in the room. It's a way to give up control, he explains,
a way to learn to let life happen as it will. I was amazed one
morning when I learned I had managed to keep my eyes shut the longest
of anyone in the class. Surrendering is not something that comes
easily to me.</TE>
<TE>   There are people who walk away from their yoga mats in tears after
a particularly tough session of aligning their mind, body and souls.
I have experienced that, but when it happened during a spinning
class, I knew something substantial was stirring inside me. In those
precious minutes, surrounded by hard bodies aiming for ambitious
athletic achievements, so much can happen. Anger dissipates, sadness
lessens, tension eases. And happiness is remarkably found in the
journey -- instead of the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Merle, one of my favorite instructors, always ends his class by
making us aware of the gift we give ourselves each time we climb on
our bikes: "Nurture your joy."</TE>
<TE>   On my bike, I am learning to do just that. I am spinning for my
heart.</TE>

<HD>Cultivating the unexpected</HD>
<DH>A new, eccentric day dawns on L.A. theater with
Wilson-Waits' version of 'Woyzeck.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Robert Wilson version of Georg Buchner's "Woyzeck," with music by
Tom Waits, is an astonishing show. Wilson's vision, his painterly use
of light and meticulous cultivation of the unexpected are unlike
anything ever before seen on a Los Angeles stage. And that is
because, with the arrival Tuesday night of "Woyzeck" at the Freud
Playhouse, UCLA, Los Angeles has, at very long last, broken its
Robert Wilson curse.</LD>
<LD>   It's been almost 20 years since the first plans were made for
Wilson to create a 12-hour opera, "the CIVIL warS," with German
playwright Heiner Muller and various composers, as the centerpiece of
the Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival in 1984. Different segments
were produced around the world but, after losing an Olympic-size
funding marathon, Wilson never got to assemble one of the most
venturesome opera projects of our time. UCLA's commission of a
Glass-Wilson work, "Monsters of Grace," in 1999 got sidetracked into
a disappointing digital 3D film.</LD>
<LD>   But with the import of "Woyzeck" -- created for the Betty Nansen
Theatre in Copenhagen two years ago and brought to UCLA as the
culmination of its first International Theatre Festival -- a new, if
eccentric, day has dawned for Los Angeles theater.</LD>
<TE>   Left unfinished by Buchner, a German medical student and political
agitator who died at age 23 in 1837, "Woyzeck" is the story of a
simple soldier oppressed by his superiors, abused by medical science
and driven to kill his mistress in a fit of jealousy. The play's
fragments haunted 20th century German theater and became the subject
of Alban Berg's opera, "Wozzeck."</TE>
<TE>   The Wilson-Waits "Woyzeck" is black cabaret shot through with
breathtakingly lurid color. Wilson's theater of images transcends
language. When he stages classic and contemporary plays and operas,
he always illustrates them as pure fantasy. He cares nothing for
psychology or character motivation. Instead, he likes to see what
happens when he lets his consciousness stream, and then, in what
might seem an impossible contradiction, he controls with cool,
precise, minimalist movement, gesture and design. It's a big deal
when characters touch, and quite rare.</TE>
<TE>   The collaboration of Wilson and Waits -- who also worked together
on "The Black Rider" and "Alice" -- is the shock of cold and hot.
Waits' music, written in collaboration with his wife, Kathleen
Brennen, is gleeful mockery of angst, with simple but deformed tunes,
impaled oom-pah-pah accompaniments and deliciously mean lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "Woyzeck" begins with carnival-esque satire. Wilson loves giants
and dwarfs. A yellow barker on stilts (Troels Il Munk) and a small
mechanical monkey are the extremes. The backdrop is a riotous splay
of color. The cast, a merry chorus line from hell, sings, "Misery's
the river of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Using an adaptation by Wolfgang Wiens and Ann-Christin Rommen,
Wilson sticks fairly close to the Buchner scenes he chooses, but his
focus is always offbeat. The Captain (Ole Thestrup) is a loony
hysteric. The Doctor who regularly humiliates Woyzeck becomes purple,
cackling Siamese twins (Morten Eisner and Marianne Mortensen).
Woyzeck's mistress, Marie (Kay Bruel), might have walked out of a
roaring '20s German cabaret on another planet. Her lover, the Drum
Major (Tom Jensen), high-steps in his red leather tails with a
devil's tale. Woyzeck's friend Andres (Morten Lutzheoft) is goofy.</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Reynaud designed the delightfully outrageous costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Woyzeck (Jens Jorn Spottag) appears almost normal, despite such
tics as his mad running in place. Nothing is what it seems, most of
all madness. Waits' twisted songs are variations on that
contradictory idea, as is Wilson's spectacular ability to affect our
emotions through the use of light. Collaborating with lighting
designer A.J. Weissbard, he turns characters suddenly red or green,
disembodies a blood-red or silver hand. Backgrounds are infused in
arresting colors that invade a spectator's psyche.</TE>
<TE>   The Danish actors -- Lotte Andersen (Margret), Benjamin Boe
Rasmussen (Karl) and children Jeppe Dahl Rordam and Morten Thorup
Koudal are also in the cast -- are exceptional in their assumption of
Wilsonian grotesqueries or singing with Waitsian raspiness; their
English is just fine. A six-member theater band, led by Bent Clausen,
shows continual imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the theater, an arts patron close to Wilson commented that
nobody, but nobody, knows where Wilson's ideas come from, least of
all Wilson himself. By passing reason, he makes singular theater out
of whatever it is that is floating through his head.</TE>

<LD>Pleasing a TV audience is an inexact science that nevertheless has
come to include some time-honored bits that never seem to wear out
their welcome.</LD>
<LD>   For wildlife specials, it's the great white shark footage. For
home video shows, it's the shot of Dad getting hit in the crotch by a
baseball. And for Christmas specials, it's capturing the look on
children's faces as their yuletide wishes come true.</LD>
<LD>   Try as it might to clutter up that last category with contrivances
and awkward gimmicks, "Dear Santa" still manages to deliver the goods
tonight at 9 on ABC.</LD>
<TE>   Hosted by Jim Belushi and featuring singer Usher and comedian Joe
Piscopo, the special takes real Christmas wish lists from a handful
of kids across the country and lets the bearded one work his magic.</TE>
<TE>   One boy, 7, worries that Santa won't be able to find him because
the youngster is away from home while being treated for leukemia in
Memphis. He yearns to visit Elvis' Graceland and to be reunited with
his friends from school.</TE>
<TE>   A girl, also 7, wants to give toys to children less fortunate than
she. Oh, and one other thing: She wants it to snow in her Arizona
hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments seem a bit labored with too much business to work
through to get to the payoff. But they do pay off, which is a nice
gift for viewers too.</TE>

<LD>"Lilo &amp; Stitch"</LD>
<LD>   Animated</LD>
<LD>   Disney, $25 for VHS; $30 for DVD</LD>
<TE>   One of Disney's best and most beautifully animated films in years
is fashioned in the watercolor style of early Disney animated
features. This imaginative, sweet family film revolves around the
friendship between a lonely little Hawaiian girl named Lilo who loves
Elvis Presley and a mischievous alien, Stitch, whom she adopts as a
pet.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition, however, isn't up to the usual Disney
standards. The DVD doesn't offer any commentary from directors Dean
DeBlois and Chris Sanders, who also supplies the voice of Stitch.
Perhaps a special edition is in the offing? The DVD, though, does
feature an "On Location With the Directors" behind-the-scenes
documentary; a how-to-hula lesson; "Inter-Stich-als" that seamlessly
put the irrepressible Stitch into such Disney films as "The Lion
King"; several deleted scenes with intros from the directors and a
look at the various Hawaiian islands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers in Goldmember"</TE>
<TE>   Mike Myers, Michael Caine</TE>
<TE>   New Line; $23 for VHS; $27 for DVD</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, baby, yeah. The third entry in the shagadelic "Austin
Powers" comedies is as uneven as the first two, but there are still
plenty of laughs, especially in the star-studded opening sequence.
This time around, Myers plays not only Austin, Dr. Evil and Fat
Bastard, he appears as the gold-challenged Dutchman Goldmember.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition is packed with extras including commentary
from director Jay Roach and a lackluster Myers, several deleted
scenes with Roach commentary, amusing outtakes, 12 behind-the-scenes
featurettes, a look at the special effects, a glimpse at the world of
British secret agents, and four music videos. The DVD-ROM also allows
you to record your own voice for certain scenes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Producers"</TE>
<TE>   Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder</TE>
<TE>   MGM, $25</TE>
<TE>   Mel Brooks won an Oscar for his very original screenplay for this
ribald 1968 comedy about a Broadway producer on his last legs who
teams up with his timid accountant to produce what they think will be
the world's worst Broadway flop, "Springtime for Hitler." Brooks, who
made his directorial debut with the film, transformed this movie into
the biggest Broadway musical in years.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a comprehensive new hourlong
documentary, "The Making of the Producers," which features interviews
with Brooks, Wilder, co-stars Kenneth Mars and Lee Meredith, and
production designer Charles Rosen; a sketch gallery; and a photo
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Duelists"</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Keitel; Keith Carradine</TE>
<TE>   Paramount, $25</TE>
<TE>   After establishing himself as a successful commercials director,
Ridley Scott made his feature film debut with this gorgeously shot
1977 drama based on a Joseph Conrad short story that the author took
from a real-life incident.</TE>
<TE>   Keitel and Carradine star as two feuding officers in Napoleon's
army. Albert Finney, Edward Fox and Tom Conti also star. Frank Tidy
supplied the haunting visuals.</TE>
<TE>   The handsome digital edition includes the wide-screen version, a
featurette with director Kevin Reynolds and Scott talking about the
technical aspects of the production, Scott's first short film, "Boy
and Bicycle," commentary and isolated score by Howard Blake, and
compelling commentary from Scott, who made this sumptuous film for
just $900,000.</TE>

<HD>Cigna Pays to Settle Medicare Charges</HD>
<DH>The health insurer turns over $24.5 million. U.S. officials
say its hospital in New Mexico filed fraudulent reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigna Corp., one of the nation's largest health insurers, paid the
federal government $24.5 million to resolve allegations that its
hospital in New Mexico submitted a decade's worth of false cost
reports to increase Medicare reimbursements, federal officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The case was brought by an Orange County man who filed a
whistle-blower lawsuit against Cigna's Lovelace Health Systems, a
health plan and 225-bed hospital in Albuquerque.</LD>
<LD>   Although there have been numerous Medicare fraud settlements,
Justice Department officials in Los Angeles, who pursued the case,
said the settlement was the largest paid by a hospital involving
allegations of Medicare cost-reporting fraud.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Razin of Laguna Beach filed the lawsuit against Lovelace in
1998 in federal district court in Los Angeles. Razin was then an
employee of Healthcare Financial Advisors, a Medicare reimbursement
consultant in Newport Beach that advised Lovelace in the handling of
certain cost reports.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Weiss, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said
Lovelace Health improperly received millions of dollars in Medicare
reimbursements by shifting certain costs to higher forms of payments
and by concealing overpayments. The false reports, she said, covered
Medicare claims from 1988 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia-based Cigna settled without admitting any wrongdoing
and said Wednesday that its internal review of the reports in
question did not turn up fraud. Cigna, which has been beset by
financial and regulatory problems recently, boosted reserves by $9
million in the third quarter to help cover the expected costs of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna spokesman Wendell Potter said that Lovelace is the company's
only hospital and that it has a deal to sell the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Healthcare Financial Advisors was not a party in the settlement.
However, Justice Department officials in their news release noted the
consultant's role in certain submissions of reports by Lovelace and
said federal officials searched Healthcare's office in Orange County
in February 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Healthcare Financial merged with Certus Corp. of Irvine in the
fall of 1998. Certus executives were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials declined to say whether Certus was under
investigation. They said, though, that this year another client of
Healthcare Financial, a Houston hospital, paid $1.5 million to settle
a similar Medicare cost-report case.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Inman, an attorney for Razin, the Orange County
whistle-blower, said her client would receive 20% of the settlement
amount, or $4.9 million. Razin, who Inman said is in his early 30s,
left Healthcare Financial shortly after he filed suit and is
operating a sunglass business.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Cigna fell 18 cents to $42.98 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Disney Filing Reveals More Director Links</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co., which has pledged to be more open with investors, on
Wednesday revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing a
more extensive list of business relationships and expenses involving
its directors.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Disney warned in the filing that it might have to
write down a $114-million investment in aircraft leases if UAL
Corp.'s United Airlines files for protection from creditors in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosures about directors come one day after Disney revealed
an SEC inquiry on whether it should have disclosed earlier than
August that four of its directors had relatives working for the
company.</LD>
<TE>   But Disney spokesman John Spelich said the filing was driven by
Disney's stepped-up efforts to provide more disclosures to
shareholders and improve its corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is consistent with our policy toward complete transparency,"
Spelich said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney this year hired noted corporate governance consultant Ira
Millstein, who has recommended sweeping changes that Disney is now
adopting to make its board more independent and provide better
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   New disclosures Wednesday included a leased car and driver as well
as office and secretarial expenses worth $268,000 provided to Thomas
Murphy, who was head of Capital Cities/ABC when Disney bought it in
1996. A firm affiliated with Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney received
$623,782 for use of a jet when it was hired for company business.</TE>
<TE>   A company owned by Eugene Bay, father-in law of Disney President
Robert Iger, received $69,892 in sports marketing consulting fees
from Disney's ESPN, although the filing notes that the relationship
dates back to 1990, before Iger married his wife, Willow Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The filling also notes that a $5-million installment contribution
toward building the Walt Disney Concert Hall was made through the
Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles. Director Andrea Van de Kamp is
chairman of the center and was a director of the concert hall but was
not a member of Disney's board when the original $25-million pledge
was made, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also disclosed it no longer uses a law firm with ties to
another director, former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged With Fraud on EBay</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say the L.A. resident failed to deliver
merchandise and scammed $453,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man was charged Wednesday with defrauding EBay buyers
on six continents in what prosecutors called one of the largest
Internet auction scams uncovered.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Chong Kim, 27, was charged with four counts of grand theft
and 26 counts of holding a mock auction for allegedly failing to
deliver the high-end computers and computer parts he sold on his EBay
business site, Calvin Auctions, according to Los Angeles County
prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Kim was arrested Tuesday and was jailed in lieu of $400,000 bail.
If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 24 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The criminal complaint against Kim listed losses of $453,000 to 26
U.S. customers, EBay Inc. and Bank of America Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Kim had
been selling computers, laptops and other equipment for two years
through Calvin Auctions. In April, he allegedly stopped shipping
products but continued to sell on EBay until his business was shut
down two months later.</TE>
<TE>   The online auction house received more than 170 complaints from
customers around the world, prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Service Sector, Productivity Surge</HD>
<DH>Two upbeat reports bode well for the economy, but some
remain cautious ahead of data on national employment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. service sector surged in November while worker productivity
grew at a rapid clip in the third quarter, two reports said
Wednesday, both encouraging signs for the struggling economy.</LD>
<LD>   A closely watched index of the U.S. service industry -- which
includes a large swath of businesses ranging from entertainment to
banking -- logged its best reading in six months and marked a huge
surge in new orders that could bode well for future growth.</LD>
<LD>   Productivity, which measures the amount of goods and services
produced for each hour of work, ran at the fastest pace in nearly
three decades on a year-over-year basis as companies wrestled to
improve profits by making the most of existing resources.</LD>
<TE>   Economists remained cautious, however, about the economy's overall
strength ahead of a report on national employment due Friday that is
likely to show few new jobs were created in November and a slight
rise in the jobless rate.</TE>
<TE>   The non-manufacturing report stood in contrast to a factory index,
also issued by the Tempe, Ariz.-based Institute for Supply Management
on Monday, that showed U.S. manufacturing in a third consecutive
month of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   ISM said its index of activity in the non-manufacturing sector
surged to 57.4 in November, handily beating market expectations of a
more modest pick-up to 53.7 and a reading of 53.1 in October. It was
the 10th straight month that the index was above the 50 mark that
divides contraction and expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The non-manufacturing new orders index, an indicator of future
growth, shot up to 58.0 in November after dropping in October to
50.9, its lowest point since January.</TE>
<TE>   A separate government report said factory orders gained 1.5% in
October, compared with a revised 2.4% dip in September. The same data
showed October durable goods orders were revised down to a gain of
2.4% from a previously reported 2.8% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Labor Department said workers outside the farm sector
boosted third-quarter productivity by 5.1% over the second quarter.
That was up from an initial estimate of 4% and outstripped forecasts
of a 4.9% gain.</TE>

<HD>Trustee Says CalPX Execs Were Overpaid</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy Court filing objects to salaries for top
officers at the defunct state power exchange.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Executives of the now-defunct California Power Exchange have paid
themselves far more than what the federal Bankruptcy Court has
approved since March 2001, according to the U.S. Trustee's office.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Trustee joined energy companies this week in objecting to
the compensation of executives at the state-chartered market, which
ceased operations nearly two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The CalPX amended its insider compensation report in Bankruptcy
Court on Sept. 25, several months after some CalPX creditors began
investigating suspected excessive compensation.</LD>
<TE>   CalPX Chief Executive George Sladoje made $1.87 million between
April 2001 and August, according to the amended report, instead of
the $365,000 a year that Chief Financial Officer Lynn Miller swore
Sladoje would make in the original filing in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sladoje, in turn, swore that Miller would be paid $215,000 a year.
She received almost $650,000 between April 2001 and August 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Compensation was paid in violation of court order and court
approval of the debtor's bonus program was obtained without full
disclosure of material facts," U.S. Trustee Maureen A. Tighe said
Monday in a filing in Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sladoje, Miller and their attorney did not respond to telephone
calls seeking comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   CalPX staff attorney Susan Rossi also has not responded to
questions on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The outgoing CalPX board of governors dismissed Sladoje on Nov.
25, saying his services no longer were needed.</TE>
<TE>   Miller remains in her post, and the board raised her annual salary
to $325,000 from $215,000, although it discontinued generous
retirement payments of which creditors had complained.</TE>

<HD>Office Market Recovery Seen in 2004</HD>
<DH>First USC forecast expects the Los Angeles region to see a
full rebound, with declining vacancy rates and increasing rents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The depressed office and industrial real estate markets in the Los
Angeles region will start to recover in mid-2003, but a full rebound
is more than a year away, according to a report released today by the
Lusk Center for Real Estate at USC.</LD>
<LD>   That means that the first half of next year should be an optimum
period for office tenants to lock in rents before they increase, said
Raphael Bostick, who conducted the study.</LD>
<LD>   "By 2004, the region's office market should be in a full-blown
recovery," said Bostick, "with declining vacancy rates, rising rents
and less generous concessions from landlords, whose profit margins
will noticeably improve."</LD>
<TE>   Bostick, a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve, was
hired a year ago to produce periodic real estate reports for USC
using funds from a grant received from Los Angeles real estate
developer Alan Casden. This is his first forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's office market softened when the economy
contracted in 2001. The office vacancy rate in Los Angeles County,
for example, rose from slightly more than 12% in premium buildings in
2000 to more than 16% in the third quarter this year. Average asking
rents stalled at $2.50 per square foot per month. To attract tenants,
many landlords reduced rents and increased concessions such as space
improvement allowances.</TE>
<TE>   Vacancies will continue to fall slightly over the next two
quarters, Bostick said. After that, the region's long-awaited
economic recovery should begin to drive up occupancy rates, resulting
in fewer landlord concessions and higher rents.</TE>
<TE>   Growth will come primarily from financial businesses, including
banks and securities dealers, and service providers such as
accountants and lawyers. Telecommunications tenants should make a
comeback by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   A regional breakdown suggests some markets will recover much
faster than others:</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles County: The brightest long-term prospects for office
landlords are in the San Gabriel Valley, which performed well during
the recession and appeals to businesses that are expected to lead the
recovery. Its relatively low rents and proximity to key business
centers make it attractive to tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Other office districts expected to prosper and to eventually raise
rents include downtown Los Angeles, Wilshire Center and the east San
Fernando Valley. The Westside, in contrast, will continue to struggle
as expensive space vacated by technology and communications
businesses drags down the market.</TE>
<TE>   Rents in the industrial market have held steady during the
downturn and should remain flat through next year, then rise in 2004
as the county's manufacturing sector resumes growth and drives
vacancy rates below 4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County: The office market was a casualty of the
telecommunications and tech meltdowns. High vacancy rates -- the
average jumped from 7.8% in late 2000 to more than 15% by the first
quarter of 2002-- and falling or flat rents will continue to be the
norm until the regional economy achieves a sustained rebound by the
end of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial rents and vacancies should remain flat through the
third quarter of 2003, at which point the economy should recover
strongly and push occupancy and rents up through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   * Inland Empire: The strongest office markets -- Ontario Airport,
Riverside and San Bernardino -- attract businesses involved in
international trade and will experience tenant growth through the
next 18 to 24 months. Rents will rise more slowly but show noticeable
increases by the end of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial market remained stable, even robust, through the
economic slowdown, with vacancies topping at about 8% and annual
rents steady at about $4.50 a square foot.</TE>
<TE>   "Parts of the Inland Empire are recession-proof," Bostick said. He
predicts that the region's concentration of international
trade-related businesses will lift occupancy and rents over the next
24 months, but not dramatically.</TE>

<HD>Glendale Galleria Purchased</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Growth Properties Inc. said Wednesday that it has completed
its $415-million purchase of the Glendale Galleria shopping mall, and
also bought a San Francisco Bay Area mall for $89 million.</LD>
<LD>   The dual purchase gives the second-largest U.S. mall owner strong
flagship properties in California.</LD>
<LD>   The Galleria, whose tenants include Macy's, Nordstrom and JC
Penney, generates annual retail sales per square foot of $525, about
60% above the industry average.</LD>
<TE>   General Growth also bought Southland Mall in Hayward, Calif.,
which it managed before the acquisition, said Beth Coronelli, a
company spokeswoman. Developed in 1964, the 1.3-million-square-foot
mall has been expanded and renovated. It is the second-largest
enclosed regional mall in San Francisco's East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based General Growth, which has 169 regional malls in 41
states, has helped lead a consolidation in the U.S. mall business as
landlords jockey for the best properties to gain leverage in
negotiating leases with retailers.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, General Growth bought $7 billion worth of malls.</TE>
<TE>   General Growth bought Glendale Galleria in a 50-50 joint venture
with the New York State Common Retirement Fund.</TE>

<HD>Gilead Sciences to Buy Triangle Pharmaceuticals</HD>
<DH>The firm would gain an AIDS drug that could receive FDA
marketing approval next fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilead Sciences Inc. agreed Wednesday to buy a struggling North
Carolina biotechnology company for $464 million in a bid to expand
its share of the AIDS drug business.</LD>
<LD>   Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead, which markets a successful AIDS
drug, will pay $6 cash for each Triangle Pharmaceuticals share, a 33%
premium over the company's closing price Tuesday of $4.50.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, if approved by shareholders, strengthens Gilead's drug
pipeline by giving the company three experimental HIV and hepatitis B
drugs that are queued up to reach the market in the next several
years. The crown jewel of the acquisition is Coviracil, an AIDS drug
that could receive Food and Drug Administration marketing approval
next fall. Analysts said annual sales of Coviracil could reach $200
million.</LD>
<TE>   Driving the transaction is the prospect of marketing Coviracil and
the Gilead drug Viread as a combination therapy, said Gilead Chief
Operating Officer Mark Perry. The best-selling combination therapy,
GlaxoSmithKline's twice-daily Combivir, should have sales of $850
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said that a once-daily pill that combines Coviracil and
Viread "could get to the levels of use in patients" as the Glaxo
drug. But he cautioned that he was not making a sales estimate.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would rescue Triangle from a looming financial crisis.
Last month, the company reported that the $68 million it had in cash
was insufficient to get it through another year, raising the
likelihood that the company would be sold.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition would mark the second step in a corporate
transformation that Gilead began last year when it sold its promising
oncology drug pipeline to OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in New York for
$200 million. In jettisoning its cancer portfolio, Gilead was left
with a business focused on HIV and viral infections but few drug
candidates in its pipeline to drive growth.</TE>
<TE>   David Webber, an analyst with First Albany, said the Triangle deal
would resolve "one long-term weakness -- the lack of a sufficient
drug pipeline" to drive Gilead's growth. He expects Gilead to launch
Coviracil for hepatitis B in 2004 and the combined AIDS therapy in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Leading Gilead's transformation is Viread, the key to Gilead's
first profitable year. The AIDS drug, launched late in 2001, should
have sales of $220 million this year, Webber said, and $370 million
next year.</TE>
<TE>   David Williams, an analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners in New
York, said that although the deal represents a long-term opportunity
for Gilead, it would put the company in a "precarious cash position."
He said the company would use most of its available cash to buy
Triangle, leaving it with $160 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gilead shares closed Wednesday at $37.61, up 73 cents, and
Triangle closed at $5.82, up $1.32; both trade on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>LAX Given High Bond Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Wednesday it gave its highest rating
ever for a U.S. general airport-revenue bond to Los Angeles
International Airport, which plans to sell $36 million of such debt
next week.</LD>
<LD>   In assigning its AA rating for the 17-year bonds, the
credit-rating agency cited LAX's solid financial shape,
"exceptionally low" existing debt burden and "strong airport
management" that maintained the airport's "liquidity and strong
debt-service" ability after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P also said the airport's diversity -- about 85 passenger
airlines and 30 cargo carriers -- is a plus because LAX isn't heavily
reliant on the fortunes of one or two airlines.</LD>
<TE>   The benefit of the high rating is that it lowers the cost of
borrowing for the airport. The bonds are expected to carry an
interest rate of between 4.5% and 5.5%, and the proceeds will be used
to reimburse the airport for capital spending on the 3,586-acre
facility.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P noted that the long-term master plan being formulated for LAX
might cost up to $9 billion. But it said the program didn't affect
its ratings for the current bond issue because "the specifics of [the
plan's] scope, timing, cost and funding have not yet been
determined."</TE>

<HD>Tech Issue Woes Help Drag Down Rest of Market</HD>
<DH>Concerns begin to arise that the sector's recovery may not
be quite as strong as many investors had been anticipating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks sagged Wednesday in the wake of a disappointing
sales forecast from computer maker Hewlett-Packard and sour
investment calls on the tech sector from several Wall Street
brokerages.</LD>
<LD>   Through Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite index had soared more than
30% from its six-year low Oct. 9, spurring some to question whether
the recent rally had come too far, too fast.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the selling mood, Hewlett Chief Executive Carly Fiorina
trimmed the company's 2003 revenue guidance late Tuesday, fueling
doubts about a pickup in business capital spending, and downgrades on
tech stocks early Wednesday from analysts at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche
Bank and A.G. Edwards cast more doubt on the sector.</LD>
<TE>   "There are worries that the tech and telecom sector is not as
sure-footed as people thought it was," Stephen Kolano, an equity
trader for Mellon Growth Advisors in Boston, told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-oriented Nasdaq slid 18.61 points, or 1.3%, to 1,430.35,
while blue-chip indexes held up better: The Dow Jones industrial
average dipped 5.08 points, or 0.1%, to 8,737.85 and the broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 3.18 points, or 0.4%, to 917.57.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth straight losing session for the Dow and the S&amp;P
500, and the third in four days for Nasdaq. Losers outnumbered
winners by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and by a slim margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, on active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Investors largely shrugged off two upbeat economic reports issued
Wednesday morning: The Labor Department said productivity grew at a
faster-than-expected annual rate of 5.1% in the third quarter, and
the Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories rose 1.5% in
October, the first gain in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Though the broad market was flat, some industrial stocks got a
lift, including United Technologies, up $1.20 to $62.75.</TE>
<TE>   Among tech names, however, HP sank 86 cents to $18.37 in the wake
of Fiorina's cautious guidance.</TE>
<TE>   In the software industry, J.D. Edwards slipped $1.59 to $12.64 and
PeopleSoft fell $1.50 to $18.06 after executives at those firms also
issued cautious outlooks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said fundamentals might not pick up fast
enough to justify the robust recent rally among semiconductor, chip
equipment, electronic manufacturing and computer hardware companies.
IBM lost $1.52 to $83.69, Intel sank 57 cents to $19.74 and Applied
Materials dropped 86 cents to $15.11.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Bank downgraded several tech stocks to "sell" from
"hold," including National Semiconductor, off $1.68 to $17.50; Linear
Technology, off $2.14 to $29.72; and Analog Devices, down $1.93 to
$27.64.</TE>
<TE>   KLA-Tencor slipped $2.19 to $40.09 after A.G. Edwards lowered its
rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Earnings concerns spurred selling elsewhere, too.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney fell 86 cents to $17.68 after cutting its
fourth-quarter earnings, citing weak ticket sales for the animated
film "Treasure Planet." Federated Department Stores dropped 73 cents
to $31.25 after it said November sales at stores open at least a year
fell 7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Treasury yields fell as some traders shifted assets out of the
equity market, seeking safety in government debt. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year T-note eased to 4.15% from 4.20% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Some drug and consumer stocks rallied as investors turned to
blue-chip names as an alternative to tech. Tobacco company Philip
Morris rose $1.28 to $39.60 and Procter &amp; Gamble gained $1.56 to
$86.05.</TE>
<TE>   *  Tenet Healthcare rose 91 cents to $18.75 after the hospital
chain cut its earnings outlook for the next two years, citing
concerns about its aggressive pricing strategy, but promised to buy
back shares in 2003.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Judge Renews Support for Sun Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing private antitrust suits against
Microsoft Corp. voiced more support Wednesday for Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s request to force the world's largest software maker to include
Sun's Java programming language in its Windows operating system
software.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz said he "could see the
theory" that Microsoft gained "an unfair advantage" in the software
market by impeding Sun's distribution of Java, conduct found illegal
in the U.S. government's 4 1/2-year antitrust case against Microsoft.</LD>
<LD>   Sun accuses Microsoft of intentionally creating incompatibilities
with competitors' products. The Santa Clara, Calif., company says
antitrust violations by Microsoft forced other companies to
distribute or use products incompatible with Java.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft attorney David Tulchin said Sun was trying to "engineer
the marketplace" in seeking a preliminary injunction to force
inclusion of the Java language in Windows, the operating system that
powers more than 90% of the world's personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   Motz opened the three-day hearing in Baltimore Tuesday by praising
Sun's plan, calling it "attractive" and "elegant."</TE>
<TE>   Economist Dennis Carlton testified Wednesday that Microsoft
documents show the Redmond, Wash., software giant understands that
widespread distribution of its .Net Framework language will help it
overcome Java and dominate the market for Internet services software.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to attain sufficient distribution so you can attract
[software] developers," Carlton said. "As more applications are
written to one platform, that increases the demand for that
platform."</TE>
<TE>   Motz interjected: "It was Microsoft's business plan."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell 17 cents to $56.54 while Sun shares slipped
11 cents to $3.76, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. automakers, using discounts, are on pace to post their
second-best sales year ever in North America. What they aren't making
more of is profits.</LD>
<LD>   The 16 largest automakers by sales in North America, led by
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler
unit, increased spending on rebates and other incentives to a record
$3,746 per car in September, CNW Marketing Research said.</LD>
<LD>   Automakers will sell 19.8 million cars and light trucks in North
America this year, compared with the record of 19.9 million set in
2000, research firm Global Insight Inc. said.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, profits before interest and taxes at GM, Ford
and Chrysler will fall to a combined $8.37 billion this year, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. analyst John Casesa estimated, less than half the $17.15
billion in profits they recorded in 2000, the last year before
automakers began relying on interest-free loans.</TE>

<HD>R.J. Reynolds to Trim 8% of Jobs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., parent of the No. 2 U.S.
cigarette maker, said Wednesday that it plans to cut more than 600
jobs, or 8% of its work force, as it battles discount brands and
increased promotions by rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The company, best known for its Camel and Winston brands, also
narrowed its earnings view and said it would exit certain businesses
and record a fourth-quarter restructuring charge. Its shares jumped
5% on the news.</LD>
<LD>   "Increased competitive promotional spending, along with the
continued growth of deep-discount brands and the effect of higher
state excise taxes, have created a significantly more challenging
business environment," Chairman and Chief Executive Andrew Schindler
said.</LD>
<TE>   As competitors such as top player Philip Morris Cos. boost their
marketing and promotional spending, R.J. Reynolds has responded by
spending more. All of the companies also have had to deal with U.S.
states increasing their excise taxes on cigarettes. As taxes rise,
customers are faced with higher retail prices and often opt for
lower-price brands.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the positive [stock] reaction is just a result of the
fact that something was actually done," said Simon Burton, senior
industry analyst for Banc of America Capital Management, which owned
about 209,000 R.J. Reynolds shares and more than 9 million Philip
Morris shares at the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably shows that they're serious about improving their
financial situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   R.J. Reynolds will take a pretax charge of about $235 million, or
about $145 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter. In October, it
said it expected to take a quarterly charge but did not outline any
details.</TE>
<TE>   R.J. Reynolds shares climbed $1.94, or 5%, to $40.76 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen about 28% since the
beginning of the year, while shares of Philip Morris have lost less
than 14% of their value over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Philip Morris closed up 3.3% at $39.60.
Other U.S. tobacco companies' shares also climbed.</TE>
<TE>   R.J. Reynolds said about $140 million of its pretax charge is due
to the planned divestiture of its packaging and botanical-extraction
divisions. R.J. Reynolds said the remaining $95 million of the pretax
charge is associated with the workforce reduction.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., said it plans to
eliminate about 635 full-time jobs within the parent company and its
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts will be mainly completed in the first half of 2003, with
about 520 layoffs and around 115 reductions through attrition, R.J.
Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   R.J. Reynolds said it now expects 2002 ongoing diluted earnings of
$6.05 to $6.10 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had expected the company to earn $5.96 to $6.25 a share
this year, according to market data firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   In October, R.J. Reynolds cut its full-year outlook to $6.05 to
$6.40 a share, compared with $7.74 a share in 2001, due to increases
in its promotional spending.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The government has upgraded an investigation into more than 2 million
General Motors Corp. cars with 3.8-liter engines after 44 owners
complained that the engines caught fire.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation involves 1996 through 2000 models of the Buick
Le Sabre, Park Avenue, Regal and Riviera; Oldsmobile 88, 98 and
Cutlass; Pontiac Bonneville and Grand Prix; and the Chevrolet Monte
Carlo. GM said it will cooperate.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration also
opened an investigation into 2001-03 models of the Acura 3.2 TL and
3.2 CL because of 35 complaints about transmission problems that can
cause the cars to quickly lose speed and come to a stop. Two crashes
and two injuries were reported. NHTSA estimates about 265,000 of the
cars are on the road.</LD>
<TE>   The Acura probe was opened after The Times reported in September
on a growing number of automatic transmission failures in V-6 powered
models. Acura, the luxury car unit of Torrance-based American Honda
Motor Co., initially denied that a problem existed, then said it had
replaced more than 24,000 transmissions under warranty. The company
announced in late September that it would extend the power train
warranties on various Acura and Honda models with the suspect
transmissions to seven years or 100,000 miles.</TE>

<LD>Verizon Wireless and three other major mobile telephone carriers won
permission to withdraw more than $13.7 billion worth of bids for
scores of wireless licenses that have been tied up in a prolonged
legal tussle.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the licenses were bought by NextWave Telecom Inc. for $4.7
billion in 1996, but the company filed for bankruptcy protection in
1998 after only paying $500 million. That led the Federal
Communications Commission to try to repossess the airwaves and resell
them.</LD>

<LD>Random House Inc. has settled a lawsuit against an e-book publisher
that was selling digital versions of Kurt Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle"
and seven other popular titles.</LD>
<LD>   RosettaBooks will continue publishing the works, which predate the
rise of the Web, and will collaborate with Random House on additional
books.</LD>
<LD>   But the settlement leaves unresolved the issue of whether authors
or publishers control rights to e-books when the contract has no
specific language about the electronic format. With rights to
countless old titles at stake, the publishing industry had followed
the case closely.</LD>

<LD>News Corp.'s Fox Cable Networks Group plans to launch a new sports
channel to appeal to teens and young men and compete against Walt
Disney Co.'s ESPN2.</LD>
<LD>   The new channel, which will be available to about 2 million of the
nation's 105 million households when it debuts next summer, will
showcase extreme sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing
and motocross. Fox said it will draw programming for the
yet-to-be-named network from its sister regional sports cable
networks and from Fox Sports Net. The company says DirecTV and Time
Warner Cable systems have agreed to carry the channel.</LD>
<LD>   The new Fox network will target so-called echo boomers -- people
born from 1977 to 1997.</LD>

<HD>IBM to Pump $3 Billion Into Its Pension Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp., the world's biggest seller of computers and related
services, will pay $3 billion this year instead of $4.5 billion over
three years to fund its U.S. pension plan.</LD>
<LD>   IBM said in October that the funding gap was $4.5 billion and that
it would pay $1.5 billion a year to close it. The shortfall has
narrowed because of stock market gains since October, Chief Financial
Officer John Joyce said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. companies including General Motors Corp. and Boeing Co. have
had billions of dollars of losses in employee pension plans, forcing
them to take writedowns and add cash to the plans to pay benefits.</LD>
<TE>   IBM declined to say what effect the pension funding would have on
fourth-quarter or 2002 earnings. The company is expected to earn
$1.30 a share in the quarter and $3.91 this year, the average
estimates in a Thomson First Call survey of analysts.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares were up 63 cents to $84.32 in after-hours trading after
the announcement.</TE>

<LD>Bowing to political pressure, the Federal Communications Commission
said it would convene a formal public hearing in February to gather
input about proposals to relax long-standing media ownership rules
that restrict who may own broadcasters and how large they can grow.</LD>
<LD>   Republican FCC Chairman Michael Powell had resisted calls for
public hearings, fearing they would take too long and cost too much.
But Powell relented after FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps, a
Democrat, threatened to host an unofficial hearing next month, even
if Powell and other commissioners refused to attend. Powell said the
hearing will take place in Richmond, Va.</LD>

<HD>Patents at Issue in Pitney Suit Against Stamps.com</HD>
<DH>The companies are arguing over the technology used by the
new NetStamps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Postage meter giant Pitney Bowes Inc. on Wednesday sued rival
Stamps.com Inc. in a new clash over patents between the companies.</LD>
<LD>   Pitney Bowes, in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware,
claims that Santa Monica-based Stamps.com's new NetStamps product
infringes on four of its patents.</LD>
<LD>   NetStamps allows customers to print a sheet of postage of any
denomination onto adhesive labels.</LD>
<TE>   "Our main goal here is to settle this matter and reach a licensing
agreement with Stamps.com," said Joseph Kirincich, assistant deputy
general counsel for Pitney Bowes. "But if that's not possible we will
aggressively pursue appropriate compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Kirincich could not say how much revenue Pitney could expect from
a licensing pact with Stamps.com. Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney has
annual revenue of $4.1 billion. But Stamps.com, which has annual
revenue of about $19.4 million, said Pitney should instead be
licensing Stamps.com products.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their complaint is part of a pattern where Stamps.com
innovates and Pitney Bowes litigates," said Seth Weisberg, general
counsel for Stamps.com. "It appears to be an effort to distract
attention away from the fact that Pitney Bowes' [new line of] mailing
systems are on the line."</TE>
<TE>   The two companies have a long history of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Pitney Bowes launched its DM series of mailing systems this year.
Stamps.com was successful in adding the products to the patent
infringement suit it filed against Pitney Bowes last year. That suit
came two years after Pitney Bowes sued Stamps.com for patent
infringement in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are expected to go to trial together sometime next year.
A pretrial hearing is set for May, Weisberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitney Bowes' latest claim against Stamps.com includes three
patents that are part of its original suit. Those patents involve
secure online printing of postage and payment for postage on
unsecured systems, Kirincich said, and the new claims involve their
use with NetStamps. The fourth patent at issue involves NetStamps'
ability to print postage on generic labels.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike traditional PC postage, NetStamps do not expire within 24
hours and do not require that customers provide a specific recipient.</TE>
<TE>   Stamps.com launched NetStamps in July after years of development
and approval from the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Stamps.com, one of the few survivors of the dot-com bust, is doing
well despite the long-running litigation with Pitney, Weisberg says.</TE>
<TE>   "While we'd be happier not to be litigating against them ... it's
part of doing business until Pitney Bowes licenses our patents,"
Weisberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Stamps.com rose 20 cents to $4.60 in Nasdaq trading.
Pitney Bowes shares fell 28 cents to $34 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>State Investigates Billing Practices of Tenet, Others</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. and other owners of for-profit hospitals in
California are under investigation by a state legislative committee
probing billing practices.</LD>
<LD>   The California Assembly Health Committee will open hearings in
January to investigate whether Tenet and other hospital chains
charged health maintenance organizations and the state too much for
services and drugs, said Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), the
committee chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet executives will be asked to testify and turn over records
and pricing schedules. Frommer vowed to subpoena hospital officials
if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   The committee will investigate accusations that Tenet's average
hospital charges are 63% higher than those at other California
hospitals, that it increased charges as much as 31% since 1999 and
that it raised drug prices at some hospitals more than elevenfold,
Frommer said. The information will be shared with the state attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   Frommer compared the rising costs to the energy crisis of 2000 and
2001 and promised to investigate whether alleged overbilling by
hospitals has violated state laws. "It is outrageous when so many
people are having trouble paying for their health care," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frommer didn't disclose the names of other hospital chains that
might be investigated or asked to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said that the California Nurses
Assn. is the source of the accusations cited by Frommer about the
company's drug pricing and that the group has supported a current
labor strike by nurses at Tenet hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about a list price that nobody pays," Anderson
said. "We have acknowledged that our list prices did increase and in
some cases were higher. However, the simple realistic fact is that
nobody pays those prices, so why are we talking about them?" Anderson
said the company would cooperate with the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The California probe is the latest setback for Santa Barbara-based
Tenet. Tenet has said the Securities and Exchange Commission is
looking into sales of its stock at about the same time the company
disclosed a federal audit of special Medicare payments.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tenet, which owns 40 hospitals in California, rose 91
cents Wednesday to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Reverses Itself on Wal-Mart</HD>
<DH>Following legal advice, City Council abandons decision to
back union bid to keep store from being constructed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hanah Cho, Abigail Goldman and Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Inglewood City Council reversed its decision to bar Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. from building a super center in the city, giving
organized labor at least a temporary setback in its efforts to limit
the giant retailer's expansion in California.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 vote Tuesday night came in response to a request from
Inglewood's interim city attorney, who advised council members to
repeal the ordinance on procedural grounds. Interim City Atty.
Emmerline Foote warned that the ordinance exposed the city to a
lawsuit and a referendum on the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Still, some on the council, along with the union representing
local supermarket clerks, say the issue is not going away. Councilman
Jose Fernandez said Wednesday that he plans to ask the city's
planning commision to consider whether an ordinance regulating large
retail stores should be enacted.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a dead issue," said Fernandez, who sponsored
the original ordinance but was absent from Tuesday's meeting. "My
position is the same as before."</TE>
<TE>   But Wal-Mart, which has already submitted signatures to qualify a
ballot referendum on overturning the original ordinance, said it
would fight any resubmission of a similar proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact they came back with it again, or with another
ordinance similar to what they had done before, under California law
it would be prohibited," said Robert McAdam, Wal-Mart's vice
president for state and local government relations. "Otherwise the
referendum process would never work and we would have to take them to
court."</TE>
<TE>   After a 30-minute closed executive session Tuesday, the council
repealed the measure, which bars construction of retail stores that
exceed 155,000 square feet and that sells more than 20,000 nontaxable
items, such as food and drugs. Although the measure did not
specifically name Wal-Mart, the criteria applied to few if any
retailers other than the Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain.</TE>
<TE>   Foote told the council that the ordinance was improperly passed as
an emergency measure and was not drafted by the city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Without the ordinance's repeal, Foote said, the city could face
expensive lawsuits that it probably would not win.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart executives say they plan to continue moving ahead with
plans to build a smaller Wal-Mart store on the Inglewood site.</TE>
<TE>   But others on the council say they will continue to fight the
nation's largest retailer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those in support of a restriction like the one passed
need to sharpen their pencils and go back to the drawing board," said
Councilman Curren Price, who had voted for the ordinance and for
repealing it.</TE>
<TE>   Union of Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, which urged the
council to impose a ban, said it would ask the council to pursue a
similar ordinance through normal channels, being careful to avoid
further procedural errors. Failing that, the union said it would
fight the rezoning of the land on which nonunion Wal-Mart intends to
build.</TE>

<HD>Investors Betting on Rate Cut in Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors betting on an interest-rate cut to stimulate European
economies pushed the euro to a 3 1/2-year high against the yen and a
1 1/2-week high against the dollar Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The European Central Bank is expected to cut rates at a policy
meeting today, and strong reports on the U.S. service sector and
productivity did little to take the shine off the European single
currency.</LD>
<LD>   ECB President Wim Duisenberg bolstered market expectations Tuesday
when he said evidence has strengthened since Nov. 7 that inflationary
pressures are easing and downside risks to economic growth have not
vanished.</LD>
<TE>   "Over the past two weeks, we've been factoring a rate cut from the
ECB," said Bob Lynch, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
"While that may have created a little bit of an interest rate problem
for the euro ... the market might be focused on future growth
prospects."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Reuters poll showed that 13 out of 28 traders expected
the ECB to cut the benchmark refi rate by half a percentage point to
2.75%. Twelve traders predicted a quarter-percentage-point cut to 3%.</TE>
<TE>   In late U.S. trading, the euro was perched above $1, up 0.04 cents
from the previous close, but off the day's highs. The euro reached
125.01 yen, a 3 1/2-year high, before trimming gains to 124.64 yen
Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>The California State Teachers' Retirement System, the third-largest

<LD>   CalSTRS owns 145,818 shares of Ingersoll-Rand and 869,749 shares

the resolution is aimed at ending corporate expatriation in which

<HD>NYPD Advisor Eyed for SEC Chairman</HD>
<DH>White House officials confirm the deputy commissioner is
among a dozen candidates under consideration to replace Harvey L.
Pitt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Police Department's top legal advisor and the official
who oversaw cleanup of the 1990 savings and loan fiasco are among the
candidates President Bush is considering to lead the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   White House officials have approached Stephen Hammerman, deputy
commissioner for the NYPD, about possibly taking over as SEC
chairman, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed their interest in Hammerman and others reported to be under
White House consideration:</LD>
<TE>   * T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a lawyer, Army veteran and former director
of the Office of Thrift Supervision who oversaw the government's
multibillion-dollar bailout of the S&amp;L industry during administration
of former President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   * Peter Fisher, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for
domestic finance, who sits on the Air Transportation Stabilization
Board, created by Congress to oversee the post-Sept. 11
airline-bailout loan program.</TE>
<TE>   * Robert Glauber, former chairman of the NASD, then known as the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization
paid for by the securities industry.</TE>
<TE>   Their candidacies were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
In confirming them, administration officials emphasized that they are
among as many as a dozen being considered to replace Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt submitted his resignation one month ago under pressure for
various missteps in handling the past year's accounting scandals that
began with the bankruptcy filing of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said Bush could settle on a nominee as early as this
month. Whoever he picks will have to be confirmed by the Senate after
what promises to be careful scrutiny by lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Hammerman is a former vice chairman at the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
investment-banking firm that did financial work for Enron. He also is
a former director of the New York Stock Exchange, and, like Glauber,
a former chairman of the NASD.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan is a managing director for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and a
former director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TE>

<LD>The NASD fined American Express Financial Advisors Inc. $350,000
Wednesday for violating rules regarding the sale of variable
annuities and variable life insurance products.</LD>
<LD>   Some American Express representatives did not tell customers that
variable annuities do not provide a tax advantage when purchased in
plans that already qualify for tax deferral, such as individual
retirement accounts, NASD said. As a result, recommendations made by
some salespeople were unsuitable, NASD said.</LD>

<HD>Former El Paso Trader Indicted</HD>
<DH>The executive is charged with reporting phony natural gas
trades to boost prices and profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former El Paso Corp. energy trader was indicted for allegedly
reporting fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry
publication in an effort to boost prices and company profit.</LD>
<LD>   The action came as part of a broad investigation into whether
energy companies hoodwinked investors and energy ratepayers,
including those in California.</LD>
<LD>   A two-count indictment by a Houston grand jury was unsealed
Wednesday against Todd Geiger, a vice president on the Canadian
natural gas trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, a subsidiary of
Houston-based El Paso Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Geiger, 38, was charged with wire fraud and filing a false report
after allegedly telling a trade publication, Inside FERC Gas Market
Report, that he had made 48 natural gas trades Nov. 30, 2001. The
trades turned out to be nonexistent, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   The charges arose from information gathered by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as part of its inquiry into market
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Several firms, including El Paso, have revealed that employees
lied to trade publications that assemble indexes of natural gas and
electricity trades. Such indexes, compiled by publications through
interviews with traders, directly influence billions of dollars of
contracts for natural gas and electricity.</TE>
<TE>   These indexes also were used by regulators to help determine
prices of electricity -- much of which is generated from natural gas
-- in California during the 2000-01 energy crisis and its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "Traders who reported false information to Inside FERC, if not
detected, pushed index prices up and down, and potentially cost
consumers of natural gas and electricity throughout the country great
sums of money," the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   An energy industry whistle-blower last month told a state Senate
hearing in Sacramento that natural gas traders routinely lied to
industry newsletters about their transactions to drive up index
prices and that the private publications were aware of the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Geiger's indictment "is just the start," said California Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante, who last month filed a civil lawsuit charging index
price manipulation by El Paso, several other natural gas firms and
two newsletter publishers, including Inside FERC owner McGraw-Hill
Cos. All of them have denied being involved in the conspiracy alleged
by Bustamante.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the
second class-action case Bustamante has brought as a private citizen
against energy suppliers. The first suit, filed in May 2001, accused
electricity generators and traders of market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we could move these lawsuits faster and get the billions
of dollars back for the consumers of California," Bustamante said in
an interview. "If you connect the dots, you can see that people were
'gaming' and manipulating the markets."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shelby, U.S. attorney for the southern district of Texas,
characterized the Geiger indictment as cutting "literally to the
heart of American busi- ness."</TE>
<TE>   "Free markets are based on truthful information, period," he said.
"You can't have free markets when there is deception in the
marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby declined to say if other indictments would be forthcoming,
but he noted: "This is one very narrow investigation in a very broad
front. We're looking into the methods by which energy companies in
Houston have conducted their business, internally and externally, and
all that this entails."</TE>
<TE>   The California energy crisis and the financial collapse of Enron
Corp., the world's largest energy trader until a quick downward
spiral last year left it in Bankruptcy Court, have sparked a host of
investigations by federal and state regulators, the Justice
Department and several state attorneys general.</TE>
<TE>   Guilty pleas have been extracted from two Enron executives in
exchange for cooperation. Michael J. Kopper is guiding federal
prosecutors through Enron's accounting machinations, and Timothy N.
Belden is shedding light on tactics used by electricity traders in
California and the West.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Corp. said it was cooperating with the investigation into
false reports to trade publications. The company last month hired a
law firm to conduct an internal review after it discovered "at least
one incident" in which "inaccurate pricing information may have been
provided to a trade publication."</TE>
<TE>   A company spokeswoman acknowledged Wednesday that the incident was
that involving Geiger.</TE>
<TE>   Platts, a McGraw-Hill unit that publishes Inside FERC, said the
trades reported by Geiger were not used in its monthly natural gas
index because they were "outside of the market price and could not be
verified."</TE>
<TE>   Geiger, who resigned from El Paso on Nov. 12, was arrested Tuesday
night. Geiger did not enter a plea when he appeared Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Houston, although his lawyer said Gieger would
plead not guilty during a court appearance scheduled for Monday. If
convicted of both counts, Geiger faces up to 10 years in prison and
fines of as much as $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   A FERC report issued in August questioned the accuracy of the
indexes being used to determine whether electricity prices during
California's energy crisis were fair. That preliminary finding was
viewed as potentially helping the state recoup refunds for
electricity overcharges.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Paves Way for Syncor Takeover</HD>
<DH>Founder agrees to pay $2.5 million in fines. Cardinal
Health trims all-stock offer by 9.6%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Syncor International Corp. said Wednesday that its founder would foot
the bill for $2.5 million in federal fines and resign from the board
of the Woodland Hills nuclear pharmacy company, settling an overseas
bribery scandal and allowing Syncor's takeover by Cardinal Health
Inc. to proceed.</LD>
<LD>   The companies said Cardinal Health, an Ohio-based drug
distributor, cut its all-stock offer by 9.6%, knocking the price tag
on the deal to less than $800 million, not including assumed debt.</LD>
<LD>   The moves follow the discovery last month by Cardinal Health of
improper Syncor payments in several countries, including $500,000
that founder Monty Fu and his brother, Moses Fu, paid to customers in
Taiwan.</LD>
<TE>   Syncor Taiwan Inc. will plead guilty to one count of violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the companies said. Monty Fu, who quit
as chairman when news of the improper payments broke Nov. 6, will
give up any role in Syncor and forfeit $2.1 million in severance pay.
He also will hand over enough Syncor stock to cover a $2-million fine
by the Justice Department and a $500,000 penalty imposed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Syncor said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a positive outcome for everyone but Monty Fu," said analyst
Andrew L. Speller of A.G. Edwards &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal intends to merge its own smaller nuclear medicine unit
with Syncor to create a subsidiary, Nuclear Pharmacy Services. In so
doing, Cardinal would become by far the nation's largest provider of
radioactive substances to diagnose and treat diseases, a business it
described as "fast-growing and profitable."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal's original offer of 0.52 of its shares for every share of
Syncor was worth about $870 million when it was announced in July. It
now plans to pay 0.47 of its shares for every Syncor share -- a deal
worth $789 million at Wednesday's closing price and one that analysts
characterized as good news for both companies and their stockholders.
Cardinal also would assume $202 million in Syncor debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances, I would not define [the revised deal] to
be a substantial discount. It could have been a lot worse," said
Lawrence C. Marsh, who follows the companies for Lehman Bros. Marsh
and Lehman have had no financial interest in the companies, though
Lehman said it expected to do some banking for them in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor, whose stock value was cut in half by the bribery
allegations, rose by $3.68 a share, or 14.1%, to $29.80 on Nasdaq.
Cardinal climbed $1.75, or 2.8%, to $64 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Fu was straight out of pharmacy school in the 1970s when he
founded Syncor's predecessor company. He became something of a father
figure to the nuclear pharmacy industry, building a network of 130
facilities that provide short-lived radioactive medicines to
hospitals and clinics.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent proxy filing with the SEC, Fu is the largest
individual owner of Syncor stock, holding 1.45 million shares valued
at about $43.5 million under the terms of the Cardinal Health
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't be reached Wednesday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal, known for making scores of acquisitions, put its
takeover of Syncor on hold last month, expressing worries about its
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   It said it is now "satisfied that it can move forward with the
acquisition in a manner that is consistent with its high standards."</TE>
<TE>   Syncor's filings with the SEC describe a two-year courtship with
Cardinal, which broke off at one point in 2001 in part because
Cardinal wasn't interested in purchasing Syncor's secondary
operation, a chain of centers that provide X-rays, CT scans and other
internal imaging services to patients.</TE>
<TE>   Those facilities, along with Syncor's overseas operations, are
being sold or closed.</TE>

<HD>State Securities Cop, Attorney General Wrangle for Power</HD>
<DH>Bill Lockyer says he wants shared authority with the
Department of Corporations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Corporations Commissioner Demetrios A. Boutris and the
state's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, both say they want to go
after corporate criminals. But for the moment, they seem just as
intent on going after each other.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is a turf battle over securities enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer, who in an interview recently referred to Boutris as "a
mosquito," announced last month that he would ask the Legislature for
broader authority to pursue securities law violations, akin to that
wielded by New York's high-profile attorney general, Eliot Spitzer.</LD>
<TE>   "I would wish for greater cooperation and collaboration between
the Department of Justice and the Department of Corporations, but I
haven't seen it," Lockyer said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general said he would seek "concurrent jurisdiction"
over securities cases in order to get a first look at criminal
matters and to share authority for bringing civil enforcement
actions.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Corporations Commissioner Andre Pineda, speaking for
Boutris on Wednesday, defended the job the department is doing and
said overlapping jurisdiction would be inefficient and confusing.</TE>
<TE>   Boutris, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has
generated a lot of sparks lately as head of what traditionally has
been an obscure agency.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Boutris irritated securities officials from other
states by criticizing as too lenient a proposed national settlement
that they and federal authorities were negotiating with a dozen Wall
Street brokerage firms over research analyst conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Other regulators said Boutris' position conflicted with that of
his own staff people involved in the negotiations and threatened to
disrupt the deal.</TE>
<TE>   To Lockyer, the incident brought a sense of deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this fall, Boutris interposed himself in a multi-state
negotiation with subprime lending giant Household International Inc.
in a way that Lockyer said stunned him and his staff.</TE>
<TE>   When regulators from California and other states gathered in
Chicago in September to work out details of the $484-million
settlement of lending violations, Household's top lawyer produced a
letter written by Boutris that criticized the deal as not tough
enough and questioned the authority of the attorney general's office
to sign it without the Corporations Department's consent.Lockyer said
he and his staff feared Household might try to use the dissension
between the California officials as leverage to hold up the deal or
get better terms. As things worked out, "we disagreed with his legal
theory and settled without his assent," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda said Boutris provided the letter to Household in response
to the company's inquiry about whether the national deal affected the
terms of an earlier, $12-million civil settlement of unrelated
violations that Household had reached with the Corporations
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no attempt to derail anything ... Lockyer was doing,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from any personality or political issues that may color the
current dispute, Lockyer said the conflict exposes a soft spot in
California law.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the attorney general acted as the lawyer for the
Corporations Department in securities cases. But in the mid-1970s,
the Legislature stripped that authority away.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Lockyer said, the California attorney general lacks
the tools to pursue civil litigation in the way that Spitzer has done
on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   At the federal level, he noted, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Justice Department work securities cases together from
the outset, with the SEC taking the civil side and the Justice
Department pursuing criminal action.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing in the law to prevent that type of cooperation in
California, but in practice it hasn't happened, Lockyer said. He
added that in the two years since Gov. Gray Davis appointed Boutris
to the job, he has referred no criminal cases to the attorney
general's office. That's why he wants such criminal referrals to be
made mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Pineda said the department regularly refers criminal cases to
district attorneys, as well as to other regional and federal
enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "there does need to be a better working relationship
between the Department of Corporations" and Lockyer's office, he
said. "We're committed to making that happen."</TE>

<HD>California Economic Recovery Stalled for at Least a Year,
Experts Predict</HD>
<DH>The UCLA Anderson Forecast says the state won't see normal
growth before 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's economy is stuck in a rut and isn't likely to get out of
it for at least a year, UCLA business experts said in a forecast to
be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Hobbled by a battered technology sector, slumping exports, a weak
job market and a staggering budget deficit, the state won't see
anything close to a normal growth until 2004 at the soonest,
according to the quarterly UCLA Anderson Forecast.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the nation's economy, which appears to be inching
forward in low gear, the Golden State appears to be stalled in a
recession with no signs of strong acceleration.</LD>
<TE>   "The good news in California is that we won't have a double dip,"
said Tom Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast.
"The bad news is that we haven't left the first one yet."</TE>
<TE>   Defining a recession for a state isn't as straightforward as it is
for the nation. For the country overall, the general rule of thumb is
two straight quarters of contraction in the gross domestic product.
Most economists believe the U.S. recession, which began in March
2001, was over by late 2001 or early 2002.</TE>
<TE>   There is no comparable shorthand for state economies. Gross state
product figures aren't available on a timely basis, so economists
typically look to other indicators such as employment and income. By
most measures, what's happening in California isn't pretty, though
the southern part of the state is markedly stronger than the north.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the state's job market is stagnant, with job
creation at a virtual standstill. The latest figures from the state
Employment Development Department show that California's unemployment
rate rose to 6.4% in October, up from 5.9% in October 2001, while the
state has 23,100 fewer nonfarm payroll jobs than it did a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   On that score, California is actually outperforming the nation.
From its pre-recession peak in the first quarter of 2001,
California's employment has declined 0.5%, compared with 1.1% for the
U.S. as a whole, according to data compiled by UCLA. Most of
California's job losses have been concentrated in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that a disproportionate share of those declines
have come in high-paid sectors such as information technology,
telecommunications and computer services, leaving the state much
worse off in terms of income than the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Over the same period, personal income in California has fallen
0.5% while personal income in the U.S. rose 3.9%. Lieser calculates
that earnings in California's manufacturing sector alone have
plummeted 17.5%, or $21.4 billion, from their peak in early 2001,
reflecting the loss of options, bonuses and other income related to
the production of high-tech goods.</TE>
<TE>   Declining incomes have taken a toll on California consumers, who
aren't propping up the economy like shoppers in the rest of the
nation. Taxable sales in California are projected to decline 3.3% in
2002 after a flat 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the technology sector has likewise hammered
exports. Shipments of computers and electronic products, the state's
No. 1 export, plunged 18% in 2001 and are down another 23% through
the first three quarters of this year.</TE>
<TE>   For state government, the bottom line is huge budget deficits as
revenue from income and sales taxes has tumbled.</TE>
<TE>   And there is little relief in sight. The UCLA forecast predicts no
strong turnaround in the tech sector next year, with overall
employment projected to grow by an anemic 0.7% in 2003 and personal
income and taxable sales improving modestly.</TE>
<TE>   This is a big reason that California legislators, who used every
financing gimmick available to close this year's $24-billion deficit,
are looking at tax hikes and service cuts to plug another
$20-billion-plus hole heading into the next fiscal year. It also
underscores why the entire state is going to feel the pain even
though the Bay Area has borne the brunt of the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "The hole we are looking at in the technology industry in the Bay
Area ... isn't going to fill up anytime soon," said Lieser, who added
that "there isn't really anything else driving us forward."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA business forecasters, the first in the nation to predict last
year's recession, have remained among the most pessimistic about the
U.S. recovery.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the economy has lived down to their expectations. They
project real U.S. GDP growth to expand by a lackluster 2.5% in 2003
as the nation waits for businesses to grab the baton from consumers
and start spending again.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't get back to normal until business investment recovers,"
said Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.</TE>

<DH>A bitter battle over benefits for aging pop stars ends with
an $8.4-million settlement</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soul singer Sam Moore is still on the road, trying to make money to
pay his medical bills.</LD>
<LD>   But that is about to change for Moore and other artists who
contend that their pension funds cheated them of health and
retirement benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Moore and others, including the estates of Motown diva Mary Wells,
Jackie Wilson and Curtis Mayfield, won a bitter fight Wednesday when
a class-action lawsuit filed against an arm of their union was
settled for $8.4 million.</LD>
<TE>   "This truly is a victory for the recording artists," said Joyce
Moore, whose 66-year-old husband tours each year to make ends meet
and just returned from engagements in Britain. "This is a great day
for those of us who have been fighting this battle for the past nine
years."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement comes at a time when the American Federation of
Television &amp; Radio Artists, the union representing the singers and
musicians who sign with major labels, is close to reaching a
groundbreaking accord with the industry that would safeguard benefits
for future recording acts.</TE>
<TE>   Sources for AFTRA and the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the
trade group representing the industry's five largest companies, say a
three-year pact is likely to be announced next week that will provide
full health-care coverage for all artists on major label rosters. The
proposal also would require labels to increase contributions to
artist pensions by about 10%, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hessinger, the national executive director of AFTRA and an
outspoken advocate for the artists, applauded Wednesday's settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only have the previous offensive provisions been deleted,"
Hessinger said in a statement, "But new artist-friendly arbitration
procedures have been established."</TE>
<TE>   That new agreement will be too late, however, for Moore and others
like the late Wells, who had to check into the charity ward of
County-USC Medical Center 12 years ago when she was destitute and
stricken with throat cancer. She died in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Wells' estate joined Moore and others in a 1993 suit accusing the
pension arm of AFTRA of failing to protect fading artists who were
left impoverished long after their talents had helped reap money for
the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that record firms in the 1950s and '60s did not
accurately report royalty earnings to AFTRA Health and Retirement
Funds and failed to make required contributions to pension accounts.
The suit also alleged that AFTRA fund trustees neglected to police
record-label contributions to artists' accounts and failed to sue
violators.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, more than a dozen artists joined the legal
battle. But reaching a settlement was not easy. One problem was that
the AFTRA fund is a separate entity from the union, and organizations
disagreed on how to settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   In March, trustees for the AFTRA fund, which has nearly $2 billion
in assets, proposed a settlement to resolve the case for 20,000
artists, most of whom would have received only a couple hundred
dollars each under the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Under that proposal, trustees offered the 15 named plaintiffs
about $100,000 each but would have deprived every recording artist of
the right to file a claim to recover benefits. That sparked an outcry
from the artist community, leading dozens of current music stars to
oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new arrangement, the 15 named plaintiffs will be paid
$25,000, but unlike previous offers, they retain the right to file
claims and challenge benefit determinations in court.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the settlement forces the AFTRA fund to streamline
its claims process and establish a fund to cover the cost of
successful benefit claims in the future. The fund also must hire an
ombudsman and launch an outreach campaign to help musicians file
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Artist managers, however, voiced criticism regarding one part of
the agreement, which awarded lawyers representing music acts $2.6
million in fees from the settlement.</TE>

<HD>Tighten the Finger on the Trigger</HD>
<DH>Bush should accept no more stalling by Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick Clawson</AU>
<BD>Patrick Clawson is deputy director of the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever he's been cornered over the last decade, Saddam Hussein has
demonstrated his skill under pressure at stalling, dividing and
diverting the West by appearing to cooperate. His strategy has been
one of token progress cloaking substantial delays.</LD>
<LD>   "Time is working for us," he said in a rare interview last month
with the Egyptian weekly Al Usbou. "We have to buy some more time,
and the American-British coalition will disintegrate because of
internal reasons and ... the pressure of public opinion in the
American and British street."</LD>
<LD>   Already, the comment heard in the corridors of the United Nations
is: If the inspectors find nothing, there is no basis for military
action; and if the inspectors find something, that proves the process
is working and so there is no basis for military action.</LD>
<TE>   The problem here, of course, is that the inspectors in the field
might compromise over one seemingly minor point after another while
the world grows tired of the Iraq problem -- until inspections become
ineffectual and Hussein breaks through to a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Washington must not allow this.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States and the world community accept an Iraqi
pattern of incomplete and delayed semicompliance, inspections simply
will become a form of enhanced containment -- only delaying Hussein's
pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. That
is not the assured and prompt disarmament that Security Council
Resolution 1441 promises and that the United States has demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's decision on enhanced containment versus assured
disarmament is fast approaching: The defining event will be how the
U.S. reacts to the declaration that Iraq is required to file by
Sunday and says it will issue Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq must disclose not only weapons and delivery systems but also
"the locations and work of its research, development and production
facilities, as well as all other chemical, biological and nuclear
programs, including any which it claims are for purposes not related
to weapons production or material."</TE>
<TE>   The declaration is central to the immediate and total disarmament
required of Iraq. Without a guide provided by the Iraqis to exactly
what programs they have, inspectors would have to search a country
the size of California for deeply hidden programs.</TE>
<TE>   The risk is whether simple containment will erode and ultimately
fail, leading to the question: Will the U.S. go to war if the
inspectors are on track to achieve enhanced containment but not
assured disarmament?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it is implausible that there will be a "gotcha"
moment, when U.N. inspectors open a secret door and find Iraqi
scientists assembling a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The tough earlier inspections team, led by Rolf Ekeus, needed four
years to uncover Iraq's biological weapons programs. The timetable on
which the new inspectors will operate will also probably be years,
with conclusions that may be ambiguous and subject to differing
interpretations. And diplomats will be reluctant to endanger the
ongoing inspections, no matter how meager the results.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the two dozen declarations that Iraq has filed with
the U.N. in the past, the one due this weekend will probably provide
some limited new information while leaving a lot of questions. Will
that be enough or will the Bush administration insist on full
disclosure?</TE>
<TE>   By saying there will be zero tolerance, President Bush has drawn a
line in the sand. That puts a heavy burden on the White House to
prove that the declaration is inaccurate, perhaps by revealing
detailed U.S. intelligence at the cost, if need be, of exposing some
secret collection capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Some will say the requirement for a full declaration is a niggling
legal point unworthy of a crisis. But if Bush decides to put some
teeth behind his tough words, he will have to show Iraq that there
are serious consequences for half-truths.</TE>
<TE>   The best response to an incomplete Iraqi declaration would be to
turn up the pressure on Hussein. Bush would be well advised to
announce that 100,000 more troops are being sent to the Middle East.
And Hussein should be told that once those troops are deployed, which
will take at least a month, the U.S. will invade unless the U.N.
Security Council finds that Iraq has made substantial progress toward
completely dismantling its prohibited-weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   The moment for decision about Iraq is almost certainly at hand. We
are not likely to have the luxury of clarity based on a blatant Iraqi
transgression. Instead, the choice will be between limited and
inconsistent progress that may be only temporary, on the one hand,
and war on the other.</TE>

<HD>Technology Raises Risk of Tyranny</HD>
<DH>The administration's sophisticated initiatives are
terrifying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert A. Heverly</AU>
<BD>Robert A. Heverly is a fellow with the Information
Society Project of Yale Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does the government know about you?</LD>
<LD>   As technology has changed in recent years, the type and the
quantity of information about us that the government can use have
increased and changed. How government gathers and uses information is
changing in ways that should be important to a people asserting the
right to control its government.</LD>
<LD>   Most people are probably not aware of the scope of these changes
or why they are important to our everyday lives in a free society.
People want to be safe. But will these changes really make us safer?</LD>
<TE>   When we look closely, we can discern a pattern of information
gathering underway at the national level that is staggering in its
breadth and purposes. Its relationship to our safety is tenuous, at
best.</TE>
<TE>   So we must look closer still. The national information-gathering
puzzle is made up of many pieces. Viewed separately, some may seem
innocuous, even common sense, while others are troubling. Viewed
together, their existence should give us all pause.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Justice Department's Operation TIPS (Terror
Information Protection System), the Department of Transportation's
CAPPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II) program
and the Pentagon's Total Information Awareness initiative. Any one of
these three projects alone is frightening. Considered together
against a backdrop of personal liberties, they are terrifying.</TE>
<TE>   The danger posed to freedom by the administration's current
initiatives lies in the use of computers and computer systems, which
allow for much of the collection and use of information. Computer
power allows government to access a greater variety of types of
information, pull more pieces together into a whole and analyze data
without needing to have a human being look at it.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, government could collect information, but it couldn't
necessarily use it all. Human intervention was required to make
connections between pieces of information. When government wanted to
tyrannize its citizens, it gathered information and placed it in
Manila file folders. Perhaps some of these files were centrally
located under the control of a person charged with determining the
importance of that information. Yet the government had only so many
resources; there were only so many people who could be tyrannized at
one time. People reviewed people, and people could do only so much.
The danger of mass tyranny was not based on information itself, but
on the leg power of government.</TE>
<TE>   But today computers allow different government agencies to share
information; information collected for one purpose is now reviewed
for others. Computers analyze according to their programs, spitting
out potential relationships between facts and figures. Tyranny, as
much as if not more than freedom, is facilitated by the computer. And
the administration's current programs have the potential for
tyrannical effects.</TE>
<TE>   How does the Bush administration respond to civil rights advocates
concerned about its efforts? As it does with its justification for
nearly all of its current activities: by reference to the "war on
terrorism." And while the administration admits that it cannot ensure
our safety from terrorism, all the while it goes about establishing
systems designed to violate our freedoms and liberties in pursuit of
a politically expedient (and false) sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who would argue that protecting the lives of
Americans takes precedence over freedoms, liberties and perhaps all
other obligations. We, as a nation, must reject this argument.
Benjamin Franklin, more than 20 years before the Revolutionary War,
said, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little
temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."</TE>
<TE>   We know that information can lead to tyranny, yet our government
is purposefully collecting and using more information about American
citizens than it has ever had before. Information about you and me,
about mothers and fathers, about sons and daughters.</TE>
<TE>   What will our government do with that information? The
administration says it will use the information to keep us safe. The
real question is: From whom?</TE>

<HD>The Unbiased Truth About Media Objectivity</HD>
<DH>The gripers are right. A free press doesn't always sit on
the fence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a columnist in Yardley, Pa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The reporting of the news is supposed to be objective, a
dispassionate recitation of the facts. But of course it never is and
never has been. What's more, it never will or could be.</LD>
<LD>   In this, the postmodernists are right. The truth does exist
somewhere out there, but we are incapable of perceiving it except
from our own inherently skewed points of view.</LD>
<LD>   So we're stuck with our versions of events or a plethora of
competing versions of the same events, none of which adds up to the
real McCoy. A lot of effort, however, is put into maintaining the
illusion that they do, especially when it comes to the news.</LD>
<TE>   American news organizations are superior because, unlike so many
other government-controlled and censored presses from China to much
of the Arab world, they tell the truth -- or so its members like to
think. They get very upset when someone suggests otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, feisty former Vice President Al Gore, who
recently accused Fox News, among other media outlets, of being "part
and parcel of the Republican Party" and of "injecting the daily
Republican talking points into the definition of what's objective."</TE>
<TE>   Tongues wagged at that one, especially on Fox News, where Gore was
painted as a nonsensical paranoid. But he shouldn't have been,
because he was at least half right.</TE>
<TE>   Gore was right that Fox, despite its much touted "fair and
balanced" tag line, has a conservative bias. And as shown by a
photograph in the Dec. 9 issue of Time magazine of Fox News Chairman
Roger Ailes backstage with former President Bush at the 1992 GOP
convention, it also has a Republican pedigree. But Gore was only half
right because Fox isn't the only guilty party. The rest of the media
are just as skewed, though mostly in the other direction. CNN founder
Ted Turner's sympathies are loudly left of center, as arguably are
the network's.</TE>
<TE>   Media bias is a familiar complaint. But until the Democratic Party
establishment (before Gore it was Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle)
started bashing so-called conservative news outlets, it was a charge
more often leveled by conservative pundits at mainstream news outlets
like the big three television networks and major metropolitan
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   On their daily Web logs, pundits Andrew Sullivan and Mickey Kaus
have made a sport of picking apart the increasingly activist New York
Times, which has a clear liberal bias that seeps into its news
analysis on a distressingly regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   As Newsweek media reporter Seth Mnookin suggested in a recent
article, Times Executive Editor Howell Raines' "hard-charging,
crusading style is coloring the Gray Lady's reputation" by "ginning
up controversies as much as reporting them." Even Times insiders are
complaining.</TE>
<TE>   Other examples of liberal allegiances among supposedly
disinterested news anchors abound. Chris Matthews, host of "Hardball"
on MSNBC, worked for both President Carter and former House Speaker
Tip O'Neill. NBC's "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert was chief of
staff for former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and counselor to former
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, both New York Democrats. ABC "This Week" host
George Stephanopoulos worked as a strategist and aide for President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The bias is there on both sides. It's unavoidable. And it's time
we started accepting the fact rather than keeping up this absurd
pretense of detachment. Balance and full disclosure are what's called
for.</TE>
<TE>   Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, scourge of liberals
everywhere, may be hopelessly partisan, but he's never claimed to be
anything else. He has an agenda, and he's honest about it. The New
York Times is no less wildly partisan and has no less of an agenda,
yet it presents itself as the tame word of God.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the real problem.</TE>

<LD>Ever since Thomas Jefferson kept rival Federalists out of government
offices, political leaders have prized the spoils system, as in "to
the victor belong the spoils." President Andrew Jackson booted out
supporters of John Quincy Adams -- and saw his newly appointed
collector of the Port of New York flee to Europe with a fortune in
customs fees.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Bush White House is rewarding political appointees through
Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.'s decision to restore for them cash
bonuses of up to $25,000 a year or more. The bonuses may well be more
than an early Christmas gift to loyal supporters, but the failure of
the administration to disclose them until they were reported by the
New York Times should raise eyebrows. Aside from the question of
whether big year-end executive rewards are a good idea in a down
economy, Bush needs to ensure that bonuses are awarded in a fashion
beyond reproach.</LD>
<LD>   Politicians have long relied on perks like bonuses to reward
financial backers and campaign workers. Reforms are always in the
works.</LD>
<TE>   After the Civil War, Congress approved a merit-based system that
ended up providing the basis for today's Civil Service, but thousands
of noncompetitive jobs remain -- to the anguish of career employees
who believe that they miss out on the influence and perks commanded
by appointees.</TE>
<TE>   The very abuses suspected by career employees appeared to take
place in the last days of the first Bush White House in 1993.
Then-Atty. Gen. William P. Barr disbursed $7,500 bonuses to two aides
who promptly accompanied him to a Washington law firm. To clean up
the process, Leon E. Panetta, White House chief of staff under
President Clinton, banned bonuses to senior political appointees in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt some political appointees deserve bonuses and should not
arbitrarily be denied the pay received by equivalent Civil Service
employees. But the White House is on the right track in its reported
statement that Cabinet secretaries and agency chiefs should review
any bonuses and determine, as far as possible, that they are being
distributed in a fair way.</TE>
<TE>   Even more desirable would be a comprehensive bonus system,
including the stipulation that recipients have served in government
for at least a year. Bush needs to see to it that the bonuses are not
just a gift in exchange for loyalty but a reward for extraordinary
service to the taxpayers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Pedro, home to the huge Port of Los Angeles, has its gripes
against the city. Too few dollars from the port are reinvested in the
community. Tons of diesel pollution generated by the port besmirch
its air. Its downtown contains a disproportionate share of group
homes for troubled youths and poorly supervised rehab centers for
addicts. The phrase "low-income housing" brings to mind the grim
Rancho San Pedro project.</LD>
<LD>   All of this helps explain why Los Angeles city leaders are so
vigorously fighting a plan to convert 545 San Pedro homes vacated by
Navy personnel in 1997 into transitional housing for families at high
risk of ending up on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   What the opponents aren't seeing is the likelihood of the
project's success and the amount of state and federal funding that it
would bring in. Local officials including Councilwoman Janice Hahn,
who represents San Pedro, and U.S. Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), who
also represents the area, are pressing the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development to set aside only 70 of the units for
low-income housing. At least 245 would be bulldozed so single-family
homes could be built on the site and sold at market rates. That plan
could gain HUD approval as early as today.</LD>
<TE>   The city's plan is far stingier than need be. Volunteers of
America, one of the largest nonprofit housing providers in the U.S.
and the would-be organizer of the assisted housing plan, has built
dozens of well-run projects nationwide. What it wants to do in San
Pedro, far from erecting a grim barracks, is restore the modest
single-family homes on the Navy property, surround them with parkland
and work with other nonprofit groups to ensure that residents get job
training, counseling and other social services. Since the mid-1990s,
one of the partner organizations, New Directions, has operated a
successful "supportive housing" program for veterans in Brentwood.
The San Pedro project also has local support from a large coalition
of religious organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The model for San Pedro is a 500-unit North Hollywood apartment
complex that Volunteers of America purchased in 1969 and renovated
for families that are "homeless or at risk of homelessness." City
leaders back then voiced the concerns now sounded in San Pedro: that
the project would increase crime and drive down property values.
Instead, the well-maintained garden apartments have helped move
thousands of families to self-sufficiency and improved the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers of America says it will sue the city if HUD approves
L.A.'s plan and the city goes ahead. It argues correctly that the
city failed to comply with a 1987 federal law, the Stewart B.
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which requires surplus federal
property to be offered first for low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   The city is already fighting lawsuits alleging it stinted
low-income housing in its downtown redevelopment plan. It should
compromise substantially on the San Pedro project, which would bring
in funding from Proposition 46 -- a state bond measure to finance
affordable housing -- as well as federal dollars. Los Angeles has
everything to gain in responding to its severe housing crisis by
working with a group that has a successful track record.</TE>

<HD>Frost Still on U.S.-Saudi Ties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia and the United States looked closely at each other after
Sept. 11, 2001, and neither liked what it saw. The United States
discovered that 15 of 19 hijackers had held Saudi citizenship, as had
Osama bin Laden until it was stripped from him. Saudi Arabia
perceived the U.S. as anti-Muslim and a strong supporter of Israeli
oppression of the Palestinians. Time has not soothed the friction
that resulted.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia took a step to repair the alliance this week,
agreeing to let the United States use Prince Sultan Air Base as a
command center and takeoff point for fighter planes in the event of
war with Iraq. That never should have been in question. The United
States built the base, at a cost of $1 billion, after the Gulf War,
and has stationed about 5,000 troops there. Pentagon planners were so
concerned about Saudi reluctance that they had been building up bases
elsewhere in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Another move to improve strained ties was Tuesday's announcement
by a chief Saudi foreign policy advisor, Adel al Jubeir, that the
kingdom was trying to ensure that charitable money did not go to
terrorists. He said that since Sept. 11 Riyadh had frozen 33 accounts
belonging to three individuals and totaling $5.6 million. At the same
time, Jubeir complained that Saudi Arabia was being unfairly maligned
over the disclosure that charitable donations from the wife of Saudi
Arabia's ambassador in Washington may have indirectly helped two of
the Sept. 11 hijackers in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The donation may well have been unwitting. The Bush administration
has muted its criticism, but it is having to fight off harsh
suspicions among some Senate leaders, including Bob Graham (D-Fla.),
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate that many Saudis do not understand the effect of
Sept. 11 on Americans. Jubeir said Tuesday that Bin Laden wanted to
drive a wedge between Riyadh and Washington, which is true. The
diplomat said that if only two or three of the hijackers had been
Saudi, "our people ... faith ... educational system" would not have
been subjected to "severe and outrageous criticism." But 15 of the 19
were Saudis, and other nations are right to ask why.</TE>
<TE>   What is truly outrageous is that the Saudi interior minister said
in an interview published last month that Zionists were responsible
for Sept. 11 and "the Zionist-controlled media ... manipulated the
events of Sept. 11 and turned the U.S. public opinion against Arabs
and Islam." Such distortions, especially by Cabinet ministers, will
keep tensions high despite all attempts to repair frayed relations.</TE>

<LD>As Alice Callaghan intimated in her Nov. 27 commentary, "Wheels of
Commerce Are Rolling Over the Homeless," it is like a war zone at the
front door of our soup kitchen, with the police detaining anyone who
simply looks like he or she might be homeless.</LD>
<LD>   The Central City Assn. claims that the current conflict is between
tough love practiced by high-minded people like themselves who want
to empower the police to arrest the "criminally homeless," and
softheaded, compassionate people like us who mindlessly defend the
"rights" of the poor to sleep on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is that skid row is like a war zone. Housing and social
services are scarce, and the police, like soldiers in combat, do not
make fine distinctions between the benign homeless and the criminally
homeless; they simply round up the enemy. In the absence of civic
compassion, civil rights are the last option for the poor.</LD>
<TE>   The right to sleep on the streets isn't all that great, but it
surely beats the heck out of the right to sleep in jail.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Coastal Drilling Blocked," Dec. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Kudos to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for blocking
President Bush and the oil crowd from going after the California
coast.</LD>
<LD>   A hundred years ago, people could not imagine giving up their
reliable horse for something new, a smoke-belching vehicle that
required fossil fuel. Today, people can't imagine giving up their
reliable fossil-fuel vehicle that still pollutes for something new, a
hydrogen fuel cell-based vehicle that will drag us cavemen into the
21st century. Ted Turner has been driving his for years. The city of
Los Angeles has just leased some.</LD>
<TE>   This is our independence from our so-called energy-producing
allies. Hopefully our joined-at-the-oily-hip leadership will see the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Heinold</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read that California Gov. Gray Davis hailed the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals' ruling upholding the state's right to scrutinize
any plans for offshore oil drilling for possible environmental
hazards as a victory for states' rights.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling stands, it effectively means that California has
banned any new oil production off its shore.</TE>
<TE>   In that California is a major consumer of petroleum products, this
could be seen as "let someone else take the risk to provide our
gasoline," or the next logical step in the "not in my backyard"
mentality so pervasive in our society.</TE>
<TE>   If the people of California are truly that concerned about the
effect of petroleum production on the environment, and not just on
their own environment, then they should demonstrate that concern by
stopping the consumption of petroleum products within their state. To
do otherwise simply illustrates their hypocrisy.</TE>

<HD>Robert Redford's Take on the Use of Fossil Fuels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Highest Patriotism Lies in Weaning U.S. From Fossil Fuels,"
Commentary, Dec. 2:</LD>
<LD>   Robert Redford has it right. While California is making a
determined effort to encourage energy conservation through
legislation and public advertisements, with good initial success, the
Bush administration gives only minimum lip service to this critical
need.</LD>
<LD>   As seen in California, the public is ready and willing to make
sacrifices if called upon by its leaders. Is the White House so
deeply obligated to big oil and other energy corporations that it is
unable to call upon the public to conserve energy? I'm afraid the
answer is yes. However, if we continue to put pressure on the
administration, through letters and e-mails, perhaps we can change
its approach -- for the long-term benefit of our country and all its
citizens.</LD>
<TE>   Howard Mandelstam</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redford complains that the Bush administration "talks tough on
military matters ... while remaining virtually silent about the
long-term problem posed by U.S. dependence on fossil fuels." I am
amazed that he speaks only of national action and that all blame is
placed there. He ignores the real users who waste so much: us, the
individual consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Redford never mentioned if he himself had purchased a Segway or
other energy-efficient modes of transportation. He never mentioned
anything about how we, the consumers, must demand and purchase
energy-efficient vehicles. We must cut back our thermostats and wear
sweaters at home, as people do in other countries. We must take the
bus or the train.</TE>
<TE>   I say it has to start at the citizen level. We have to demand the
products that will save energy, and I don't hear from Redford how he
has done that himself. I can only imagine he has another movie coming
out very soon.</TE>
<TE>   Robbie R. Kidwell</TE>
<TE>   Tyler, Texas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unless Redford wants to give up air travel and his fleet of
sub-40-miles-per-gallon vehicles, he needs to shut up. The
overwhelming cost of implementing solar power as our main energy
source greatly outweighs all benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, more jobs will be lost in the fossil-fuel industry than
will be created in Redford's fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Sjolander</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anyone literate enough to read Redford's commentary knows there
has been the technology to "wean" this country off fossil fuels for
40 years. Rather than blame President Bush and his cronies, or the
Arab oil cartel, for our being held hostage to our energy needs,
let's focus on the real culprits.</TE>
<TE>   The folks to watch, which no one seems to be doing very closely,
are the executives of the multinational oil companies. They serve
neither the interests of the U.S. nor of the people in the Middle
East, only their own.</TE>
<TE>   David Goldenberg</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calling all old-style and timid, moderate Democrats: A new idea
like wrapping renewable energy sources into a national security issue
is the type of "in your face" challenge to Bush that is sorely needed
to jump-start the run toward 2004.</TE>

<LD>It is disgusting but not surprising to read "Iraq Falling Short, Bush
Says" (Dec. 3). It is less than a week into the inspections that he
has demanded for almost a year and, by all accounts, they are going
well, which makes President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney even
more anxious and determined to get their war by any means and at any
cost to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than doing their job and dealing with Al Qaeda (the real
problem), they continue to raise the bar and beat the war drums. They
have long shown their desperation in this regard, singing the same
old songs ad nauseam. I think, to save time, The Times and other
major newspapers should have their "U.S. Attacks Iraq" headlines
ready to go. Perhaps they already do.</LD>

<TE>   Let's see if I have this right. Bush tells us that if the
inspectors find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that means we
start bombing. And, if the inspectors don't find any weapons of mass
destruction, that "proves" that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass
destruction, but he is hiding them and has lied to us. That also
means that we start bombing. Makes sense to me.</TE>

<TE>   How fitting that Sandy Tolan's critique of America's plans to
upset the Mideast map came from Berkeley, awash in anti-America and
anti-Israel philosophy (Opinion, Dec. 1). In his analysis, Tolan
neglected to mention our alternative: waiting until the forces of
radical Islam fulfill their dream of committing a terror attack upon
America that will truly destabilize our nation's ability to
counterattack. Every day counts.</TE>

<LD>Re "Unemployment Ploy," letter, Nov. 28: Prior to my unemployment, I
was a software professional for over 20 years. During that time, I
paid my income taxes, Social Security taxes, property taxes, sales
taxes, etc. I've put far more into the system than I've ever taken
out. Then the economy tanked, my company closed the office where I
was working, and I was out of a job. So I began collecting
unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   But it was no vacation. I spent every workday reading ads,
searching Internet job listings, sending resumes, making phone calls,
going on interviews. Looking for work became my full-time occupation.
But lots of other programmers were also out of work, and I was just
one of hundreds of qualified applicants for every position. So it
took almost a year to find another job.</LD>
<LD>   The government was not paying me not to work. It was providing
temporary financial assistance to help me get through a difficult
situation that was not of my own making.</LD>
<TE>   So before you complain about the government "giving away" your tax
dollars to people like me, stop and think about the various
government services you've used over the last 20 or so years -- paid
for, in part, by my tax dollars.</TE>

30: This country needs a national police force. The disaster of the
Washington-area snipers evading capture for so long underlines the
ineffective, disjointed and bureaucratic makeup of our more than
14,000 law enforcement agencies that will not and cannot communicate
with each other.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement agencies next door to each other have no idea what
their neighbors are doing, let alone what is going on in another
county or state that is hundreds or even thousands of miles away. If
this country does not start to put together a real national police

then we can kiss the war on terrorism and our country goodbye before
this initial skirmish is even over.</LD>

<HD>Allan Adler, 86; Crafted Beauty Queens' Crowns, Silver
Pieces for the Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allan Adler, who became known as the "silversmith to the stars" for
his celebrity clientele that ranged from Errol Flynn to Michael
Jackson, died Tuesday of a stroke at Providence St. Joseph Medical
Center in Burbank. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   From the time he began his career as an apprentice in 1938, Adler
designed silverware and holloware in unadorned, geometric shapes
inspired by the Modernist art movement of the early 1900s.</LD>
<LD>   After his name became associated with Hollywood glamour in the
early 1940s, he was commissioned to design mini-Oscars for Academy
Award winners and crowns for Miss Universe and Miss U.S.A. as well as
silver bowls, candlesticks and goblets for his celebrity clients. In
the 1950s, he began to attract political leaders and socialites.</LD>
<TE>   One special commission he was most proud of came during John F.
Kennedy's presidential campaign. Adler crafted a silver coffee urn to
be used at a fund-raising event for Kennedy, who was elected in 1960.
Soon afterward, he designed flatware for California Gov. Pat Brown
and a silver hairbrush for Winston Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   A savvy businessman as well as an artisan, Adler opened his own
shops, first on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, later in La Jolla,
Corona del Mar and San Francisco. (A fire in 1980 destroyed the first
shop, along with about $1 million in inventory and equipment.)</TE>
<TE>   He once described his style as "clean lines with a bent toward the
unconventional." A teapot modeled after a teardrop and a coffee urn
shaped like an oversized egg were among his favorite creations.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Missoula, Mont., Adler moved to Burbank with his parents
as a young boy. He intended to be a building contractor, but when he
met and fell in love with Helen Rebecca Blanchard, his plans changed.
Her father was Porter Blanchard, a seventh-generation silversmith in
the Arts and Crafts tradition. In 1938, Adler married Rebecca
Blanchard and became an apprentice to her father. Two years later, he
went into business for himself.</TE>
<TE>   His Sunset Boulevard shop attracted Hollywood actors and
actresses, several of whom took private silversmith lessons from him.
One student, Katharine Hepburn, occasionally worked in the shop.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn became a customer after he entered the shop, dropped a
rhinoceros hoof on the counter and said, "Make an ashtray out of
that." Adler's celebrity client list spurred business. "They put
their stamp of approval on my work and made it fashionable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Adler won a government contract to produce
silver tubing for radar equipment, which gave him immunity from the
draft and provided him with a voucher to buy silver, which was being
rationed at the time.</TE>
<TE>   A large man with arms strong from hammering silver, Adler was not
destined to serve in the military. When his government contract ended
near the end of the war, he was inducted into the Army, but was soon
discharged because of allergies to onions and garlic.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he designed the President Dwight D. Eisenhower golf
trophy and a punchbowl for the governor's mansion in Sacramento.
Dinah Shore commissioned key rings as gifts for the guests on her
television show "Dinah's Place."</TE>
<TE>   Some custom orders were a joint effort. "I've learned that the
most important thing is a good design," Adler explained in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I would sit down with a customer, discuss what they had in mind
and pass a sketchbook back and forth. We would play until we got it
right."</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, Adler was asked to design crowns for Miss Universe and
Miss U.S.A. He made a geometric rendition of the planets for one and
a headdress of ancient Egyptian motifs for the other. He delivered
the Miss Universe crown under police escort and posed for a
photograph with the winner wearing his creation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Illinois Sen. Adlai E. Stevenson called on Adler to
design a campaign pin for his presidential race. Life magazine had
published a photograph of Stevenson's shoe with a hole worn through
the sole. Adler used the picture as a model for the thousands of
campaign pins he made for Stevenson. The pin won press for Stevenson,
but he lost the election.</TE>
<TE>   As his reputation as a hand craftsman grew, Adler attracted the
attention of curators and publishers, as well as famous clients.</TE>
<TE>   "In the age of automation, Allan Adler continued to work by hand,"
said Connie McNally, editor and publisher of Silver magazine in
Rancho Santa Fe, this week. "His workmanship made him famous."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Breitweiser, who owns Studio 2 antiques shop in Santa
Barbara, has carried early Adler pieces in his store. "It's highly
collectible; it has a following," he said of Adler's work. Although
Adler was a prolific worker, his flatware is not rare, Breitweiser
said. But his commissioned pieces made for celebrities command a
higher price, he said. He and several auctioneers declined to put a
dollar value on such pieces.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Adler worked in a Pacoima studio that had once
belonged to his father-in-law, Porter Blanchard. He continued to
attract celebrity clients, including Jackson, who commissioned a
silver belt, and Carol Channing, who carried the silver lunchbox he
made for her to banquets and awards shows. She is allergy prone and
takes her own food with her.</TE>
<TE>   Adler also spent more of his time sailing in the 76-foot yacht,
Shawnee, that was built the year he was born. He bought it in 1954
and slowly restored it over the years.</TE>
<TE>   He received honorary awards from the Smithsonian Institution, the
Museum of Modern Art and others, but Adler considered himself part of
an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I had 24 craftsmen working for me. Now I have seven," he
told The Times in 1990. (More recently, the number dropped to four.)
"I do not exaggerate when I say silversmithing is a lost art. It died
in my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife of 63 years, Adler is survived by daughters Linda
Adler Hughes and Cynthia Adler Larson, three grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at 12:30 p.m. Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial
Park-Hollywood Hills, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Henry Chauncey, 97; Pioneered Use of SAT in College
Admissions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Chauncey, who as founder of the Educational Testing Service
played a pivotal role in the rise of standardized testing in college
admissions, died Tuesday at his home in Shelburne, Vt. He was 97 and
died of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Chauncey was president of the testing service from its inception
in 1947 until his retirement in 1970. During that period, he
championed the use of the exam then known as the Scholastic Aptitude
Test, or SAT, as a tool to extend opportunities for a high-quality
education beyond the privileged classes.</LD>
<LD>   "He hoped that it would make it possible for colleges and
universities to admit people based on their merit rather than on
their social or economic background by finding a standardized way to
make judgments about people's intellectual abilities," said his son
Henry.</LD>
<TE>   Although the vision for a merit-based entrance system came from
Harvard College President James Bryant Conant in the 1930s, Chauncey
provided the managerial skill to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   Under his guidance at ETS, the SAT became a powerful -- many would
say overbearing -- presence in academic life, fretted over by
millions of anxious high school seniors desiring good scores to
impress the colleges of their dreams. ETS, which administers the
test, grew into a large, influential organization that today has more
than 2,000 employees at its Princeton, N.J., campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry was a truly gifted administrator. He built ETS from
scratch," said Nicholas Lemann, author of the recent book "The Big
Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy." "Conant, his
mentor, was shocked by how big Henry made it."</TE>
<TE>   Conant wanted to fulfill Thomas Jefferson's hope of a "natural
aristocracy," based on ability rather than the privileges of high
birth. Chauncey was an assistant dean at Harvard in 1933 when Conant
asked him to help expand the student body beyond the usual circle of
Northeastern prep school graduates. Was there a test, Conant asked,
that could help determine who might be worthy recipients of a Harvard
scholarship?</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey found an answer in the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which
had been invented by a Princeton psychologist, Carl Brigham. A
modified IQ test, it had been used in a pilot program in 1926
involving 8,000 high school students.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham, was opposed to Chauncey's and Conant's vision of the test
to build a better, more diverse ruling elite. But, four years after
he died in 1943, ETS was founded with Chauncey as president, Conant
as chairman of the board and the SAT as the centerpiece of an
ambitious plan to spread the idea of meritocratic admissions to other
top-rated schools.</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey saw the test as a tool that could help people understand
their abilities. "It seemed to me," he told an interviewer, "that we
knew more about the horses in the country than we knew about the
people of the country."</TE>
<TE>   The test, now taken by about 2 million students a year, sank deep
roots in American education, in large part because of Chauncey's
marketing skill. Striving to expand interest in the test beyond the
elite Eastern colleges, he established a Berkeley office and
recruited UC Berkeley Chancellor (and later UC President) Clark Kerr
for the ETS board of trustees. Kerr, according to Lemann's book,
embraced the SAT as a tool that would help UC become a top research
institution. It would do this by ensuring that only the brightest
students were admitted.</TE>
<TE>   In Lemann's view, the SAT also was critical in shaping Kerr's
Master Plan, which established California's three-tiered public
education system and funneled the highest-scoring students to UC and
others to the state and community colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the SAT has been the focus of raging debates over
its fairness, attacked for cultural biases that critics say have put
women and many minorities at a disadvantage. It remains a hot potato
in the post-affirmative action age. Earlier this year, the UC regents
were poised to drop the SAT as an admissions requirement until the
College Board, which owns the test, promised to develop a new one.</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey disliked the emphasis college admissions officials placed
on the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   "The controversy in great part arises because some people use the
test as the sole measure" of college fitness, said his son. "My
father always believed that was a terrible mistake."</TE>
<TE>   The son of an Episcopal minister, Chauncey was born in Brooklyn,
N.Y., and grew up in Columbus, Ohio. He was descended from Puritans
who came to Massachusetts from England in 1637.</TE>
<TE>   He was educated at Groton, then attended Ohio State University for
a year. Through the generosity of a Wall Street financier, he was
able to transfer to Harvard, where he majored in philosophy but also
studied psychology and educational testing.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of his graduation in 1928 he was hired as an
assistant dean of freshmen and assistant coach of freshman football
and baseball. He chaired the committee on scholarships, work that
brought him to his later achievements in testing.</TE>
<TE>   During a two-year leave of absence during World War II, he worked
as associate director of the Army-Navy College Qualifying Tests. He
later oversaw the development of tests that were used to determine
which draft prospects would receive college deferments.</TE>
<TE>   He formally resigned from Harvard to become president of ETS after
the war, in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Chauncey's legacy, said ETS Vice President Eleanor Horne,
was that he made large-scale testing a reality. But he also "insisted
that testing practices be grounded in research," she said, "and that
it be dedicated to meeting the needs of individuals and educational
institutions, and not testing companies."</TE>
<TE>   Lemann, who considered Chauncey a friend, said it was "unbearably
ironic" that the ETS founder died a day after the U.S. Supreme Court
decided to hear an important affirmative action case involving the
right of the University of Michigan to allow race as a factor in
admissions. The policy discounted to a degree the role of test
scores, which displeased critics.</TE>
<TE>   "That case gave Henry great pain," Lemann said, noting that "there
is a direct line between the advent of the SAT and ... the creation
of and assault on affirmative action. All of these lawsuits are based
on SAT scores or LSAT scores. It tremendously bothered Henry that his
creation was being used for that purpose by conservatives."</TE>
<TE>   Chauncey is survived by his third wife, Janet; eight children; 14
grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Eugene Gregorie, 94; Key Designer in the Golden Age of
Ford, Lincoln</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was considered the "grand old man" of Ford car design.</LD>
<LD>   Eugene T. "Bob" Gregorie, who became the Ford Motor Co.'s first
design department chief in 1935 and presided over a Golden Age of
Ford, Lincoln and Mercury styling through the late 1940s, has died.
He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Gregorie, who died of undisclosed causes Sunday in St. Augustine,
Fla., is best known for creating the Lincoln Continental.</LD>
<TE>   Originally designed as a personal car for Ford Motor Co. President
Edsel Ford, the Continental debuted as a prototype in 1939 and hit
showrooms in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   An instant critical hit for its sleek and graceful lines, the
Continental was selected by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in
1951 as one of the eight best prewar automotive designs.</TE>
<TE>   Gregorie also helped design the 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr, which the
Museum of Modern Art called "the first successfully streamlined car
in America."</TE>
<TE>   And he styled the 1949 Mercury -- the car immortalized by James
Dean in "Rebel Without a Cause" -- which featured fenders that were
integrated with the body design.</TE>
<TE>   "Gregorie was the last of the greats of the Golden Era of design
in the '30s and '40s," said Jim Farrell, a Roseburg, Ore., attorney
and automotive historian who has written extensively about the
history of Ford design.</TE>
<TE>   During his years at Ford, Gregorie worked closely with Edsel Ford,
the son of founder Henry Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought along the same lines and had a very satisfactory
meeting of minds," Gregorie told the Florida Times-Union in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Farrell said, "If you know and appreciate Fords of the
'30s and '40s, you've got to credit them to Edsel Ford and Bob
Gregorie."</TE>
<TE>   "Gregorie had the unique ability to translate onto paper Edsel
Ford's ideas and thoughts," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Designers that were at Ford during the Gregorie-Edsel Ford years
talk about seeing Edsel Ford in Gregorie's office and Gregorie
drawing as Edsel was talking and literally coming up with these
absolutely gorgeous cars."</TE>
<TE>   With the Lincoln Continental, Farrell said, "they basically were
able to cobble a Zephyr into probably one of the most beautiful cars
that's ever been built.</TE>
<TE>   It was a long hood and a short deck, with a continental [exposed]
spare tire. It had a gracefulness about it that reminded people of
racing boats."</TE>
<TE>   Although the aesthetically acclaimed Continental never became a
high-volume commercial success, it quickly became a favored car of
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth, Ronald Reagan and other stars who enjoyed
motoring around Hollywood in their two-door Lincoln coupes and
convertibles.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to marketing conditions, the Ford Motor Co. announced
earlier this year that it would cease production of the Continental.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a mechanical engineer who also ran an import business,
Gregorie was born in New York City in 1908 and grew up on Long
Island, where he sketched boats and car designs as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   A high school dropout, he began his professional life at 19 when
he went to work as a draftsman for a small ship-design firm in New
Jersey and then a larger one in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, he began designing custom-car bodies for Brewster and
Co., a New York coach-building firm.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year later, he was working at General Motors' design
center in Detroit but was laid off after two months because of the
Depression.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in late 1931 after about five months of unemployment,
Gregorie received a call to work as a body draftsman at Ford's
Lincoln plant in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln, Farrell said, is where most of the styling innovation,
under Edsel Ford's creative leadership, had been occurring at Ford
Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Edsel kind of transferred that over to the Model A [in the late
1920s] and then the '32 Ford," Farrell said. "As they started setting
up a separate design feature, that's where Gregorie came in."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first cars Gregorie was asked to design was the Model
Y, a smaller Model A for the British market.</TE>
<TE>   "Edsel was so pleased with the design," Farrell said, "he had
somebody else in essence enlarge the design to be what became the '33
Ford."</TE>
<TE>   That marked the beginning of the streamlined look that "by 1936
was in full flower with the [Ford] Zephyr," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ford Motor Co. had never had a separate design department and
when it established one in 1935, Edsel Ford put Gregorie in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The 1949 Mercury, which was originally scheduled to come out in
1947 as a Ford, was the last car that Gregorie designed.</TE>
<TE>   After the death of Edsel Ford in 1943 at the age of 50, Farrell
said, Gregorie was forced out of the company by Harry Bennett, who
was running the company for the ailing Henry Ford.</TE>
<TE>   But Gregorie returned in 1944 at the request of Henry Ford II, who
later became president.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the same, however.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Breech, who was recruited from General Motors to become
executive vice president of Ford and help teach Henry Ford II how to
run the business, initiated a GM-style committee system of design at
Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "Gregorie had always worked one-on-one with Edsel Ford," Farrell
said. "He didn't like the committee system and decided it was time
for him to leave Ford."</TE>
<TE>   In late 1946, at the age of 38, Gregorie moved to Florida. From
then on, Farrell said, he designed boats.</TE>
<TE>   Gregorie is survived by his wife, Evelyn.</TE>

<HD>T. Miller, 44; Teacher Praised for Heroism at Columbine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Theresa Miller, a Columbine High School teacher who ran through the
hallways warning people during the 1999 massacre, died of colon
cancer Monday in Littleton, Colo. She was 44.</LD>
<LD>   Miller taught for 20 years in the Jefferson County School
District. She was head of Columbine's science department for the last
two years and was its Teacher of the Year in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a true hero and an inspiration to all of us," Columbine
Principal Frank DeAngelis said Tuesday. "She wasn't sure if she would
live or die on April 20, and her life was spared only to find out she
had cancer."</LD>
<TE>   The diagnosis came a few months after two students attacked the
school April 20, 1999, setting off explosives and killing 12 students
and a teacher before killing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who was on hall duty at the time, extinguished a fire
started by a pipe bomb, led dozens of students to safety and stayed
with fellow teacher Dave Sanders as he bled to death from gunshot
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, President Clinton noted Miller's heroism in an
address to the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Theresa had an appointment to see her doctor just after April 20
and with everything that happened, she had to reschedule," DeAngelis
said. "It wasn't until that summer that she was diagnosed with colon
cancer, and two years later it moved to her lungs."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was born in Roswell, N.M., and graduated from New Mexico
State University.</TE>
<TE>   Besides teaching, she volunteered in elementary schools, as well
as working with the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   Miller taught right up until the end, leaving the Tuesday before
Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband and three children.</TE>

<HD>Ne Win, 91; President Bankrupted Myanmar, Enriched Self</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ne Win, a reclusive, eccentric general whose ruthless rule bankrupted
Burma economically and spiritually during his 26 years in power, died
this morning at age 91 in Yangon, members of his family said.</LD>
<LD>   Burma, which changed its name to Myanmar in 1989, paid dearly for
the socialistic, xenophobic policies of Ne Win's reign. Once seen as
potentially the richest county in Southeast Asia, it became the
poorest. Human rights were routinely abused, corruption was rampant
and individual freedoms were nonexistent.</LD>
<LD>   Ne Win, who took power in a 1962 coup, kept his officer corps
loyal over the decades with large cash grants, often deposited in
Swiss bank accounts. He also provided well for himself and his family
-- he married seven times, twice to the same woman -- with a fortune
estimated at $4 billion and properties in Austria and Germany.</LD>
<TE>   He died at his lakeside villa, where he had been under house
arrest with his daughter since March, when three grandsons and a
son-in-law were arrested on charges of trying to overthrow the
military government.</TE>
<TE>   Ne Win had such faith in astrology and superstition that mysticism
became part of national policy. He introduced 45- and 90-kyat notes
to the currency because he believed nine was a lucky number and the
numerals in each added up to nine. He once ordered his ministers to
eat mohingka, a poor man's dish of fish and noodles, for three days
to ward off national poverty.</TE>
<TE>   In France for a state visit in 1984, he abruptly went home when a
member of his entourage had a motorcycle accident, believing it a bad
omen. At various times in Rangoon (now Yangon), the capital, he was
seen dressed as a king in one working-class district and walking
backward over a bridge at night -- apparently following the advice of
soothsayers who remained close advisors throughout his life.</TE>
<TE>   Ne Win, born Shu Maung in the town of Paungbe on May 14, 1911,
dropped out of the University of Rangoon in 1932 and began his
working life as a postal clerk. Later he became associated with Aung
San, the leader of Burma's independence struggle against Britain, and
in 1940 was one of 30 nationalists sent to Japan for military
training.</TE>
<TE>   He took the name Ne Win ("Bright Son") there and became a
commander in the Japanese-sponsored Burma National Army, which in
1945 switched to the Allied side as Japan's defeat in World War II
became imminent. By the nation's independence in 1948, he was Burma's
second-highest-ranking officer. Fourteen years later, as
commander-in-chief, he led the coup that overthrew Burma's
democratically elected government.</TE>
<TE>   Ne Win's ruling revolutionary council was known as the Burma
Socialist Program Party, and his ideology was something he called the
Burmese Way to Socialism -- a rigid Stalinist blueprint that closed
Burma to outsiders, put absolute power in the hands of the military
and shut down all avenues of free expression.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ne Win, a country rich in timber, oil, natural gas, gems and
minerals became poorer and poorer and eventually had to apply to the
United Nations for "least developed status."</TE>
<TE>   The Burmese -- who now number 50 million -- never loved the
president they called "the Old Man," but they didn't exactly hate him
either. He was a godfather, unpredictable and frightening, but he
could make poor men rich and change national policy on a dime -- as
he did overnight once, ordering everyone to start driving on the
right side of the road, instead of the left, on the advice of a
wizard.</TE>
<TE>   He resigned as president in 1981 but maintained power as party
chief. He warned his colleagues the day he resigned: "Though I will
not be in the parliament ... I shall be watching from the party, and
when I give advice where needed, do things with discretion. I shall
continue to do things, but all those who would be directly concerned
with the practical aspects of the work should exercise utmost
caution."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, he stunned the country by resigning as party
chairman in the midst of pro-democracy student protests that claimed
3,000 lives at the hands of the army. He took "indirect"
responsibility for the unrest but said that if the military had to be
called in again to quell demonstrations, there would be no warning
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his "retirement" from politics, Ne Win continued to
quietly influence Burmese events until his death, manipulating the
juntas that followed his rule. They paid lip service to the return of
multi-party democracy, but that goal remained elusive, even after
Myanmar's leading opposition figure, Aung San Suu Kyi, won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Ne Win ended his life as a recluse, holed up for months and years
at a time in the heavily guarded lakeside home. Between 1989 and
September 1997, when he traveled to Jakarta to meet with his friend
Indonesian President Suharto, he was not seen in public.</TE>

<HD>Timid Response to Harassment Claim Disputed</HD>
<DH>A UC Berkeley professor counters statements made by the
attorney of alleged assault victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson and Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>A UC Berkeley law professor Wednesday rebutted assertions that
faculty members responded timidly to a student who sought help after
an alleged sexual assault by the law school's dean.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing what she called "mistakes in statements made in the
press," professor Eleanor Swift said she counseled a student at
length on ways to pursue a sexual harassment complaint against Dean
John P. Dwyer, who resigned last week because of the allegation.</LD>
<LD>   Swift, a former associate dean at the Boalt Hall law school, said
that when the woman sought her advice in the spring of 2001, several
months after the alleged victim claimed to have been molested by
Dwyer, she described several formal and informal steps that the
student could take. Ultimately, she said, the student decided not to
pursue the matter while she was enrolled at the school.</LD>
<TE>   The woman, who graduated in May, filed a formal sexual harassment
complaint with the university in October. Laura Stevens, the woman's
attorney, has said that university faculty were uncertain when
approached for help by the student and feared retaliation by the law
school if they came to the student's aid.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said university officials tried to keep the matter quiet
to protect the reputation of the prestigious law school and its
highly regarded dean.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not fear retaliation against me if I were to help her,"
Swift said in a two-page written statement released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Another professor, Linda Hamilton Krieger, said Monday that she
tried to offer the woman assistance as well, even contacting the
university's Title IX officer in charge of sexual harassment
complaints to obtain information for the student about the complaint
process. Krieger said she assumes that the alleged victim waited
until October to file her complaint because she was studying for the
bar exam.</TE>
<TE>   The university acknowledged Monday that the student sought help
from three female professors, but did not name them.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday with The Times, before she made public that
she had been consulted by the student, Swift said, "I do not believe
women faculty would have refused assistance to the student because of
fear of retaliation. I simply don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Swift said Wednesday that she spoke in her office with the student
in the spring of 2001. "She was upset, angry and scared," Swift said.</TE>
<TE>   "I treated this matter with utmost concern, care and caution,"
Swift said. "I sought to give her some comfort. I kept her statements
confidential, which is what she wanted."</TE>
<TE>   At a second meeting with the student, Swift said, she described
the university's sexual harassment complaint procedures, and outlined
less formal approaches "that might produce an acknowledgment from the
dean and some form of remedy, plus assurance that this would not
happen to other women students."</TE>
<TE>   Swift said she offered to communicate with the dean herself, or
ask a male faculty member to talk to the dean. She offered to
accompany the student to talk with the executive vice chancellor and
provost without filing a formal complaint, Swift said.</TE>
<TE>   After describing the options, Swift said, the student "said that
she wanted to be able to finish law school and concentrate on her
academic and public interest work, which she feared she could not do"
if the matter became public while she was at school, Swift said.</TE>
<TE>   Swift, 57, had lodged a grievance against the university in 1987
when she was initially denied tenure. An expert on evidence law, she
has some experience with conflicting witness accounts. She once wrote
an article entitled, "Rival Claims to 'Truth.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer, whose resignation is effective Jan. 1, described a "single
encounter" that he said was consensual. Attorney Stevens said Dwyer
"grossly mischaracterized" the December 2000 incident, which she said
was a sexual assault that occurred after a night of drinking.</TE>
<TE>   By Stevens' account, the alleged assault occurred after her client
went to dinner with a professor and other students. They were joined
at the restaurant by Dwyer, who later accompanied the alleged victim
and four other students to a bar.</TE>
<TE>   After the second gathering, Dwyer drove the student to her Oakland
apartment. Stevens said her client remembers waking at 4:37 a.m. and
found Dwyer, fully clothed, in her bed fondling her.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Official Expected to Admit Conflict</HD>
<DH>Shawn Boyd, a Seal Beach councilman until he lost a March
election, has agreed to a deal with the state Fair Political
Practices Commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd is expected to plead guilty
to a felony conflict-of-interest charge and pay a $25,000 state fine
for voting on matters that benefited a business partner, according to
documents filed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, who lost his council seat in the March election, agreed to
the terms in a stipulation deal he signed last month with the state
Fair Political Practices Commission, according to state records.</LD>
<LD>   "This stipulation is part of a global settlement reached in
cooperation with the Orange County district attorney's office,"
concludes the seven-page agreement signed by Boyd and commission
Executive Director Mark Krausse.</LD>
<TE>   The panel will formally adopt the terms of the agreement at its
Dec. 13 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges had been filed against Boyd as of Wednesday,
and officials at the Orange County district attorney's office
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, two sources knowledgeable about the case said Boyd is
expected to be charged and plead guilty Dec. 13. Boyd couldn't be
reached for comment. His attorney, Allan H. Stokke, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into Boyd began in October 2001 after a
complaint was filed by a local activist over the councilman's
relationship with developer Richard Hall, who owned the Seal Beach
Trailer Park.</TE>
<TE>   Between January 2001 and June 2001, Boyd voted several times to
use city funds to help a nonprofit group buy the park from Hall.
However, Boyd failed to disclose that he had been paid $104,000 by
Hall for consulting, government-relations work and expenses.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   There was a sudden loud clunk of colliding metal as my sports car
spun. The other driver, holding a cell phone to his ear, muttered a
common obscenity while stepping onto the glass-splattered street.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have to call back," the young yakker told his phone partner,
slamming closed the device that I figured had obscured my vehicle
from his vision.</LD>
<TE>   Neither of us was seriously hurt. But our small cars were totaled.</TE>
<TE>   And ever since I've been extra wary of motor-mouth drivers
clutching cell phones -- whether in tinny, flyweight compacts or in
armored SUV tanks. Whether they're tailgating nervously on the
freeway, racing inattentively into merging traffic or barging along
bumper-to-bumper downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, I'm biased anyway against these new nuisance
necessities-of-life. They rudely interrupt relaxing lunches and
prompt normal people to walk around in a daze, seemingly talking to
themselves. Fine, let cell phones raise other people's blood
pressures. My cell stays off until I want to use it, which is rare.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everybody has a story to tell," says Assemblyman Joe
Simitian (D-Palo Alto). "An accident that didn't have to happen. A
career damaged. A life lost."</TE>
<TE>   Simitian, 49, is a former Santa Clara County supervisor, Palo Alto
mayor and school board president. He repre-</TE>
<TE>   sents the Silicon Valley, but doesn't worship everything
high-tech.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he's trying to take cell phones out of the hands of
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   No, he's not trying to snatch everybody's car phone. Relax, radio
talk-show hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Simitian would allow cell phones in vehicles. He'd just require
them to be hands-free for drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got one hand on the wheel and one hand clutching a
cell phone to your ear, you're not in complete control of your car,"
the lawmaker notes, using simple logic.</TE>
<TE>   Violators would be fined the same as people caught not wearing
seat belts: $20 the first time, $50 thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   His bill would exempt emergency calls.</TE>
<TE>   There are many hands-free devices and attachments available, from
simple earplugs and headsets to installed speakerphones. Some fancy
new phones even can be dialed by voice.</TE>
<TE>   New York is the only state with a similar law. But it has been in
effect just one year. There's no conclusion yet about its impact on
safety.</TE>
<TE>   A Harvard University study released Monday reported that the death
toll from crashes caused by drivers talking into cell phones is
rising significantly. It estimated 2,600 fatalities a year, compared
with 1,000 two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in California, according to a Times analysis, at least
4,699 accidents were blamed on drivers using cell phones. Those
crashes killed 31 and injured 2,768.</TE>
<TE>   "It surprised me, the number of cell phones involved in
accidents," says CHP Commissioner Dwight O. "Spike" Helmick.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers don't know what types of cell phones were being used:
hand-held or hands-free. So Helmick says the CHP will dig deeper to
collect that data.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Helmick adds, "it just makes common sense that if
you're not holding a cell phone, you're safer. Inherently, you're
safer to have both hands free."</TE>
<TE>   Simitian has proposed his ban on hand-held phones for three
straight years, the latest time Monday as the new Legislature
convened. His first two bills were narrowly killed by the Assembly
Transportation Committee. But this third time may be the charm.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick previously opposed the legislation, arguing that hand-held
phones weren't a big problem. But now, he says, if Simitian's bill
passes, "I'll probably recommended it be given favorable
consideration" by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The cell-phone industry is split and opposition is softening. Some
previous opponents are reconsidering, suspecting they have bigger
battles to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless has supported Simitian's bills, preferring one
statewide law to potentially different restrictions imposed by
several local governments. That fear also was the driving force
behind New York's law.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics note that drivers also are distracted when using
hands-free cell phones. But at least both hands are on the wheel and
their sight's not impaired.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists can lose focus punching radio buttons, eating a
hamburger or lecturing the kids. But these actions don't require much
thought -- not like talking and listening through static to somebody
not sharing your present driving experience.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're on the phone with somebody and they say, 'I want a
divorce,' that engages you," Simitian observes. "You're thinking
about one thing and looking at something else. And you don't have
both hands to control the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to solve the problems we can solve."</TE>
<TE>   This is one problem that the Legislature can solve, although too
late for my sports car.</TE>

<HD>27 Candidates File for 7 L.A. Council Seats</HD>
<DH>One will be unopposed. Term limits are opening up
opportunities for newcomers to City Hall.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With seven Los Angeles City Council seats up for grabs in the March
primary, nearly 30 candidates filed papers by Wednesday's deadline,
leaving only one race without any competition.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel of Van Nuys faces no opposition in her
quest for reelection to the east San Fernando Valley's 2nd District
seat. Greuel was elected in April to fill the uncompleted term of
Joel Wachs.</LD>
<LD>   Council members Nick Pacheco and Tom LaBonge will face
challengers, while three other seats are open because incumbents are
prevented by term limits from seeking reelection, and a fourth was
vacated when Mark Ridley-Thomas was elected to the Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   "Incumbency is a very daunting task for anyone to run against,"
said political strategist Matt Klink. "But with term limits, there
are seats opening up. It's an opportunity for new faces and bright
and shining stars to come to the surface."</TE>
<TE>   One incumbent leaving office in July is Councilwoman Ruth Galanter
of Venice. She will give up her seat representing the 6th District,
which was redrawn during redistricting last July from covering part
of West Los Angeles to representing much of the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Three people, including Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama
City), are seeking to represent the newly configured 6th District,
which includes Panorama City and Arleta, as well as portions of Sun
Valley and Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates who filed nominating petitions are
businessman Jose Roy Garcia and administrator/psychological counselor
Christopher Trujillo.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia and Trujillo were the leading vote-getters in two city
council races for a proposed Valley city as part of the Nov. 5
secession measure that was rejected by voters.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas lost an election to Greuel in April for the 2nd District
seat, but he is seen as the front-runner in the 6th District race.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most competitive race in the San Fernando Valley will
be in the 12th District, where longtime Councilman Hal Bernson is
being forced out of office because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. school board member Julie Korenstein, former Assemblywoman
Paula Boland and Bernson chief of staff Greig Smith are among seven
seeking the seat, which represents Granada Hills, Chatsworth,
Northridge and Porter Ranch, most of North Hills and parts of Canoga
Park, Encino, West Hills, Mission Hills and Winnetka.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders include accountant Armineh Safarian Chelebian,
businessman Robert Vinson, teacher/businessman/mediator Norman
Huberman and businessman Walter Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Chelebian and Prince ran unsuccessfully for a city council seat
for a new Valley city as part of the secession measure, while Boland
was the leading vote-getter for one such seat.</TE>
<TE>   In the 4th Council District, which runs from Toluca Lake and North
Hollywood to Silver Lake, Miracle Mile and Koreatown, LaBonge will be
challenged by film executive/producer Derek Milosavljevic.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge was elected in October 2001 to fill out the uncompleted
term of Councilman John Ferraro, who died in office.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco will face former state Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa in Pacheco's reelection bid in the 14th Council
District, which includes parts of Boyle Heights, Eagle Rock, Highland
Park and Mount Washington. Former Olympic boxer Paul Gonzales also is
seeking the seat.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
hopes to represent South Los Angeles' 8th Council District, the seat
being vacated by Ridley-Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates in that race include economic development
executive Forescee Hogan-Rowles, publisher Kevin Melton, community
activist Robert Cole and developer Sherri L. Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   In the adjacent 10th District, six people are seeking the seat
held by Councilman Nate Holden, another veteran who will be leaving
office in July. They include Assemblyman Roderick Wright, Holden's
chief deputy Deron E. Williams, activist John Caldwell, attorney Leo
Terrell, city assets manager Reggie Jones-Sawyer, and educator Martin
Ludlow.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those who filed nominating petitions Wednesday will have
to wait a few days before the city clerk verifies that they turned in
enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.</TE>

<HD>Energy Consultant May Be Fined Over Conflict</HD>
<DH>State advisor proposed an improper deal with a power firm
whose stock he owned, panel says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>An energy consultant should be fined $5,000 for advising the state on
a contract with power company Calpine Corp. while he owned Calpine
stock, according to a settlement to be voted on next week by the
state political watchdog agency.</LD>
<LD>   The Fair Political Practices Commission is scheduled to vote Dec.
13 to impose the maximum fine for violating the state's
conflict-of-interest code on Richard Ferreira, one of dozens of
consultants hired at the height of the electricity crisis last year.</LD>
<LD>   A former top official with the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, Ferreira owned 50 shares of Calpine stock worth more than
$4,000 when he recommended in June 2001 that the state Department of
Water Resources sign a three-year, $150-million electricity contract
with Calpine.</LD>
<TE>   Ferreira did not negotiate the contract, and a DWR deputy official
made the final decision to sign it. The state had hired Ferreira in
January 2001 under a two-year, $500,000 contract.</TE>
<TE>   He and four energy traders who also owned Calpine stock were fired
by the DWR in July 2001 after the state required energy consultants
to publicly disclose their financial interests. Ferreira sold his
Calpine stock that month. He now works as a consultant to the state
public power authority, and could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although politicians and reporters had raised conflict-of-interest
questions about several state workers and consultants involved in the
state electricity crisis, Ferreira is the only official to face a
personal fine from the Fair Political Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In a settlement last March with the FPPC, the Department of Water
Resources agreed to pay a $69,500 fine from its budget for belatedly
requiring 52 energy consultants to disclose potential conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   In summarizing their case against Ferreira, the FPPC investigators
noted that he told two supervisors at the DWR that he owned Calpine
stock before he offered his opinion on a Calpine contract. The DWR
officials did not advise him that he might face a conflict of
interest violation.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators concluded that as a veteran public servant,
Ferreira "should have known of his obligation to avoid conflicts of
interest."</TE>

<HD>Fred Jordan Mission a Light on Skid Row</HD>
<DH>Charity founded in 1944 offers aid to a new generation of
homeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a black-and-white picture hanging on the wall of Fred
Jordan's downtown mission, showing the slender young minister
preaching to a flock of bedraggled men in the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Except for the faded dungarees and creased hats of a bygone age,
and except for Jordan himself, the photo could have been snapped
yesterday on the same skid row corner. Outside the six-story Fred
Jordan Missions at 5th Street and Towne Avenue, the same hard
hopelessness stalks a new generation of sick, hungry and addicted
people lining the dirty sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been working on these streets for more than 50 years," said
Willie Jordan, Fred's 69-year-old widow, who runs the nonprofit
Christian charity her husband founded in 1944. "I certainly don't
have the answer."</LD>
<TE>   What she does have is hope, a hot meal for a homeless woman, a
Christmas toy for a poor child. And she has three of her seven
children working with her, helping the most destitute of Los Angeles'
poor by providing clothing and blankets, job training, Bible study
and other services.</TE>
<TE>   The organization received $10,000 from last year's Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign. That money helped fund the mission's
after-school program, which meets four days a week and serves about
200 children. It offers tutoring, meals and a safe place to play.</TE>
<TE>   These days the bulk of Fred Jordan Missions' tattered clients are
women and children. When Willie Jordan came to the mission in the
1950s, skid row was populated by men, "winos, mostly," she recalled.
"We didn't see women on the street until the early '70s," when a
prostitute who had been brutally beaten came to the mission for help.</TE>
<TE>   The rising divorce rate and the spread of devastating drugs such
as crack cocaine sent more and more women spiraling toward skid row.
Just blocks from Los Angeles City Hall, the area is a forlorn and
sometimes violent neighborhood of tents, plastic tarps and shopping
carts.</TE>

<HD>LaBonge Backers Agree to Pay Fines</HD>

<LD>Ten relatives and friends of Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge
face a total of $11,500 in fines for violating city ethics rules
regulating independent expenditures when they ran a radio ad campaign
for LaBonge.</LD>
<LD>   The city Ethics Commission released agreements Wednesday signed by
LaBonge's relatives and friends in which they admitted 23 violations
and agreed to the fines. Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham
also signed the agreements, which is subject to approval by the panel
at its Tuesday meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "Though I am disappointed errors were made inadvertently by
members of my family, I am proud of their immediate actions to
rectify the situation," the councilman said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   LaBonge noted that the Ethics Commission did not accuse his
campaign of involvement in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud of my campaign and our strict adherence to all
campaign rules and regulations," he said. "I expect all candidates
and their supporters to follow the rules. I hold my own campaign and
our supporters to an even higher standard."</TE>
<TE>   The friends and relatives, including five of LaBonge's brothers,
financed a $10,000 radio advertising campaign by a committee they
called Filmakers [sic] for New City Leadership, which was formed to
support LaBonge's run for the 4th District seat in the October 2001
election.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 violated ethics rules before the election by making
contributions to the committee of $1,000 each, which exceeded the
limit of $500 on contributions to committees supporting candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also filed a campaign finance disclosure statement
nearly six months late and failed to provide the Ethics Commission
with a script of the radio ad 24 hours before it began running.</TE>
<TE>   The late filing had the effect of "making it impossible for the
public to determine in a timely way whom was financially supporting
the independent expenditure," an Ethics Commission summary of the
case stated.</TE>
<TE>   The LaBonge supporters could have been fined up to $115,000, but
Pelham recommended the lower penalty.</TE>
<TE>   She said that none of the individuals fined had previous
violations and that they cooperated in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Those fined "stated they are politically inexperienced, were
unaware of the legal contribution limit, did not intentionally
violate any rule or law, and have accepted responsibility for their
conduct," the commission summary stated.</TE>
<TE>   Denis LaBonge, the councilman's brother and treasurer for
Filmakers for New City Leadership, agreed to pay the largest amount,
$6,500.</TE>
<TE>   Others fined included brothers Christopher LaBonge, Mark LaBonge,
Matthew LaBonge and Robert LaBonge. Fines were also levied against
the councilman's sisters-in-law Lilly LaBonge and Robin LaBonge,
cousin Lloyd Ahern and friends Doris Ollestad and Lata Ryan.</TE>

<HD>Suit Seeks Access to Budget Reports</HD>
<DH>GOP assemblyman wants the Legislature to see state
agencies' proposed spending cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A Republican assemblyman sued the Davis administration this week over
hiding documents that could help lawmakers who are struggling to
close a record budget gap.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Keith Richman of Northridge asked Sacramento County
Superior Court on Tuesday to require the release of documents
detailing how the leaders of state agencies propose to slash spending
by 20%.</LD>
<LD>   In August, as the scope of California's vast budget shortfall was
becoming clear, the Department of Finance asked all state agencies to
list ways to shrink costs by 20% without crimping essential services.</LD>
<TE>   That information, Richman said, deserves to be seen by legislators
struggling to close a projected budget shortfall of as much as $30
billion -- more than one-fourth of the entire general fund -- over
the next year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do we have the responsibility of crafting and passing a
budget, we have responsibility for legislative oversight of the
executive branch," Richman said. "If we don't have the information
from the various departments and agencies on what they believe are
the best opportunities for spending reductions, then how can we make
those decisions?"</TE>
<TE>   Richman filed the lawsuit with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.
The complaint accuses Finance Director Tim Gage of violating the
California Public Records Act by refusing to release the cost-cutting
plans of various state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In an October letter to Richman, Gage argued that secrecy better
serves the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Production of these documents would discourage candid discussion
and inhibit the free flow of ideas within the department as well as
between the department and the governor's office," Gage wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said he is willing to wait to see the documents until
after Jan. 10, when Gov. Gray Davis is scheduled to propose a 2003-04
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that the governor very well may want to keep that
information confidential while he and his staff are going through the
deliberative process," he said, "but once that is done, all of that
information should be available to the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   Finance department spokeswoman Anita Gore said Gage had yet to see
the lawsuit. But the documents should remain confidential even after
Davis proposes budget cuts, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The same argument holds," Gore said. "They are part of the
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the process is over, they're still confidential
documents," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Richman was a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed last summer seeking to
force the Davis administration to make public dozens of long-term
electricity contracts signed by the state at a cost of tens of
billions of dollars.</TE>

<LD>Mention was made here of a poached eggs dish described as "embezzled
eggs" on a menu in Spain. Which prompted Pam Palmer of L.A. to recall
some memorable translations she encountered while living in Japan.
For instance, she saw a map of mountains that referred to a "Dirty
Water Punishment Place."</LD>
<LD>   You know, a sewage treatment plant.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks for the warning: Jeffrey Allen and his grandson Jonathan
Fajardo spotted an automotive garage that seemed to specialize in

<TE>   Disorder in the court: Some oddities saluted in California Lawyer
magazine's 2002 Legal Follies issue:</TE>
<TE>   * Pop guru Mike Batt, who created the 1970s group the Wombles, was
sued for allegedly stealing a song called "A One Minute Silence." The
song consists only of silence. "The plaintiffs' lawyers claim that
Batt's silence sounds exactly like a 50-year-old piece by the late
composer John Cage," the magazine said.</TE>
<TE>   * Singer James Brown (a k a the Hardest-Working Man in Show
Business) "was sued by two of his daughters for $1 million because he
refused to pay them back royalties for songs that the women say they
co-wrote with the soul legend when they were 3 and 6 years old."</TE>
<TE>   * An accused drug dealer told a judge that "his name was
copyrighted and that he wanted to be paid $500,000 every time court
personnel addressed him. 'You do not have my permission to use my
name without compensating me,' he said." (With my expense account, I
don't dare name him.)</TE>
<TE>   Trashed by the stock market: A security guard who worked the
recent Hollywood Christmas parade reports that one of the most
eye-catching attendees was a bystander of "a very weird nature. He
had taken a black trash bag, cut out holes for his arms and head and
placed a paper bag over his head with eye cut-outs."</TE>
<TE>   The character wore a sign advertising a Web site. "I watched him
stand there for over four hours when, out of the blue, he went over
the rail and was marching in the parade," the guard said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers chased him back to the sidewalk. The guard said he then
asked the guy to explain himself. "He said, hey, he had burned
through $5 million in his last dot-com," the guard reported, "and was
starting over from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope the guy's latest venture doesn't go down the drain to a
Dirty Water Punishment Place.</TE>

<HD>Toxin Found in Simi Valley's Ground Water</HD>
<DH>State officials aren't sure where the perchlorate came
from, but nearby Rocketdyne lab has the same contamination. Drinking
supplies safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State investigators have found a highly toxic chemical used in rocket
fuel in 18 water wells in Simi Valley, but the contamination has not
been traced to the nearby Rocketdyne testing site.</LD>
<LD>   The chemical perchlorate, which has been linked to thyroid
problems, has also been found in wells at the Santa Susana Field Lab,
but there is no evidence that contamination in the city migrated from
there, according to a new report by the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control.</LD>
<LD>   Drinking water supplies are not contaminated or threatened,
officials said, because most of Simi Valley's tap water is imported
from Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   With the latest findings, perchlorate has now been detected in
ground water at three locations on the Rocketdyne site, and in lower
concentrations in wells to the north, south and east of the hilltop
lab.</TE>
<TE>   The highest state reading was 19.2 parts per billion -- nearly
five times the allowable limit of 4 ppb -- at a monitoring well at a
gas station in Simi Valley. The readings were taken this year.</TE>
<TE>   State investigators could not determine the chemical's source, but
they noted that Rocketdyne is the nearest known location with
perchlorate contamination. Solid rocket fuel "is the main source of
perchlorate contamination found in ground water" across the nation,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials said there is no proof the chemical comes
from the lab, noting that perchlorate has not been detected in
springs in the undeveloped area around the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The data from the state is very compelling and shows it's not
coming from Rocketdyne," said Art Lenox, an environmental scientist
at the lab. "But activists continue to want to use the data to point
fingers at Rocketdyne."</TE>
<TE>   The company has tested wells of various depths around the lab's
perimeter, and no seepage was detected, Lenox said.</TE>
<TE>   The perchlorate discovered in Simi Valley more likely came from
firecrackers, fertilizer or road flares, all of which contain the
chemical in concentrations high enough to trigger the findings, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The geology of the field lab, with its bedrock faults and
sandstone, would absorb contaminants and minimize migration, Lenox
said. What's more, he said, a large part of the work conducted at
Santa Susana involved kerosene or liquid oxygen, not heavy rocket
fuel containing perchlorate.</TE>
<TE>   The closest structure on the lab site is about a mile south of
Simi Valley city limits and about 1 1/2 miles from the nearest
housing subdivision. Several contaminated wells are within 2 1/2
miles of the closest building at the rocket-testing site.</TE>
<TE>   From January to August, state officials took water or soil samples
from 76 wells -- 68 shallow and eight deep -- 25 springs and 30
drainage ditches between Rocketdyne and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The state detected perchlorate in ground water less than 20 feet
below the surface in wells north of the field lab.</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate also was found this year south of the lab, near the
proposed Ahmanson Ranch housing development, and it was detected in a
well east of the site last year.</TE>
<TE>   State officials will discuss their findings during a meeting
Wednesday at the Grand Vista Hotel in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne conducted nuclear energy research at the lab for
decades until chemical and nuclear contamination was found in 1989.
The lab is now undergoing a federally funded $186-million cleanup,
but rocket testing continues at the site.</TE>

<HD>Second Jury Deadlocks on Death for Anaheim Killer</HD>
<DH>Triple murderer Trinh had asked for execution for his 1999
hospital rampage. The district attorney must decide on trying a third
time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second jury has deadlocked on whether a man convicted of murdering
three hospital employees in a 1999 Anaheim shooting rampage should be
put to death.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for a week before voting 11 to 1 Wednesday in
favor of the death penalty for Dung D. Trinh, who has dared jurors to
give him the death penalty for his actions. Orange County Superior
Court Judge John Ryan declared a mistrial in the penalty phase of the
case.</LD>
<LD>   In September, the first jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of life
in prison without parole, with many jurors concluding Trinh did not
deserve death because he was emotionally distraught.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome leaves Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas with the choice of
trying a third time to win a death sentence or agreeing to impose
life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting rampage prompted Rackauckas three years ago to
declare that his office would seek the death penalty in all cases
that involve random, multiple killings.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas on Wednesday declined to reveal his next move, but he
reaffirmed his view that execution is an appropriate punishment for
mass killings. He also said there was no reason to review his
office's policy on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the nature of the case ... the random shooting of
people who were vulnerable and in a hospital, I believe the death
penalty is the right punishment here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thought about this a lot since it happened, and I still feel
strongly that it's the right policy."</TE>
<TE>   The killings occurred Sept. 14, 1999, when Trinh armed himself
with a pair of revolvers and walked into West Anaheim Medical Center
seeking vengeance for the death of his mother hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh, 46, was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder
and one count of attempted murder after just three hours of
deliberations. The defendant, who blamed the hospital for his
mother's death, took the stand during the first penalty phase and
pleaded for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare all of you to send me to death," said the heavily tattooed
Trinh. "I deserve it. I not only deserve it, I need it. I want it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Trinh's urging, jurors have found it difficult to agree on
an appropriate punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a defendant says, 'Put me to death' doesn't
necessarily cause jurors to want to do it," Rackauckas said. "Jurors
consider death very seriously, and they need to be very strongly
convinced."</TE>
<TE>   Trinh, who was videotaped as he calmly fired and reloaded,
believed his 72-year-old mother died because workers at the hospital
had botched her care. Defense lawyers did not deny that Trinh killed
hospital maintenance director Ronald Robertson, 50, nurse's aide
Marlene Mustaffa, 60, and pharmacist Vincent Rosetti, 50.</TE>
<TE>   But they argued that the shooter was suffering emotional and
physical breakdowns at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's mother died at another hospital on the morning of the
shootings but had had her hip replaced at West Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, the Orange County district attorney's office has
prosecuted 340 murder cases with "special circumstances," under which
death is a potential penalty. The office has sought the death penalty
in 90 of those cases, or 26%.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 49 convicted killers face the death penalty in Orange
County, and all of those cases are in various stages of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas must decide by Dec. 19 whether to continue seeking the
death penalty.</TE>

<LD>The man suspected of being the Belmont Shore rapist, Mark Wayne
Rathbun, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 64 criminal charges stemming
from attacks on 14 women.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks, occurring between April 2000 and last month, include
the rapes of nine women and assaults on five others. Several of the
victims are elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Rathbun, 32, was picked up by police on Nov. 8, when a perimeter
was set up around a neighborhood in Long Beach after an attempted
sexual assault. He was booked on an unrelated drug count, and police
took a sample of his DNA.</LD>
<TE>   Rathbun was released, but officers kept him under surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, after tests matched his DNA with evidence from a
dozen of the attacks, he was arrested. Bail is set at $11 million.</TE>

<LD>The Stanislaus County sheriff and district attorney are investigating
money-laundering allegations against Mayor Carmen Sabatino and the
City Council.</LD>
<LD>   The state attorney general's office requested the investigation,
Stanislaus Dist. Atty. James Brazelton said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Sabatino is accused of failing to disclose $3 million in business
loans, as required by state law. And the district attorney is looking
at whether the council was guilty of favoritism toward builders of a
1,700-acre housing development in exchange for campaign
contributions.</LD>

<LD>   County officials say the Department of Defense never issued a
warning when the county approved the plan 10 years ago.</LD>

<HD>Man Pleads Guilty in Smuggling Case Tied to Fatal Crash</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO -- A Mazatlan, Mexico, man pleaded guilty Wednesday to
immigrant smuggling charges stemming from a head-on highway collision
in June that killed six people and injured 16 others.</LD>
<LD>   The crash occurred as a van packed with more than 20 illegal
immigrants attempted to evade a border checkpoint by driving the
wrong way on Interstate 8. The van, which had its headlights off,
struck four oncoming vehicles along a dark stretch of road just after
9 p.m. June 24.</LD>
<LD>   The deadly collision took place about 50 miles east of downtown
San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Alfredo Alvarez-Coronado, 25, entered his plea to a single count
of bringing illegal immigrants into America for financial gain. His
trial would have taken place early next year in U.S. District Court
in San Diego. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors plan to drop
13 additional smuggling charges.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez-Coronado faces a minimum term of three years and a maximum
of 10 years in federal prison when he is sentenced Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   He is being held without bail in the Metropolitan Correctional
Center. He is the only person to face charges in the crash. Killed
were the driver, four undocumented immigrants and a New Mexico man
whose SUV was hit. Assistant U.S. Atty. Sherri Walker Hopson said
Alvarez-Coronado admitted that he guided the immigrants across the
border. But she said prosecutors could not charge him with murder or
manslaughter because he was not the driver.</TE>
<TE>   "At sentencing, we will argue that he should be accountable for
the deaths of these aliens and the [other] people," she said.</TE>

<HD>Woman Guilty of Threatening Judge</HD>
<DH>She sent jurist menacing letters over her dispute with a
former employer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Redondo Beach woman was convicted Wednesday of sending menacing
letters to a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, including a threat to
bomb his courthouse and a warning that his daughter and grandson
would be "hung or dragged from a truck" by white supremacists.</LD>
<LD>   Testifying in her own defense during a bench trial in U.S.
District Court, Mimi Villegas Galdi, 36, said she never intended to
carry out the threats against Judge William J. Beverly Jr., who is
assigned to the Superior Court's appellate division in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Galdi, described by her defense attorney as suffering from
delusions, testified that she was frustrated by Beverly's refusal to
intervene in a 12-year-old legal dispute she had with a former
employer.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder, who heard the case,
dismissed three other counts lodged against Galdi after her arrest in
April. The defendant has been in custody since then.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder set sentencing for March 3. Galdi faces a statutory maximum
of 10 years in prison but is likely to receive a much lighter
sentence under federal sentencing guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   A dental technician, she was fired from her job at Megdal Dental
Corp. in Lawndale in 1989. A legal dispute between Galdi and fellow
employees was later heard by a Torrance court commissioner, who ruled
against Galdi. She then filed a complaint about the proceedings with
Beverly, who at the time was supervising judge at Torrance Superior
Court. In 1995, he dismissed the allegations as unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   Thus began what Assistant U.S. Atty. Joey L. Blanch described as a
"barrage" of rambling letters from Galdi to Beverly, demanding a new
hearing on her allegations that she was wrongly discharged and a
victim of sexual harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly testified earlier this week that he first became alarmed
in 1998 when Galdi sent him a letter asking, "Do I have to go on a
shooting spree to get your attention?" The judge notified the
Sheriff's Department, which maintains a squad that investigates
threats against judges and the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's detective talked to Galdi, and the letters stopped,
but they resumed earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, U.S. Deputy Public Defender Pedro
Castillo described Galdi as "someone who was very troubled, someone
who was crying out for help" from Beverly. He said the case would
have turned out differently had Beverly sat her down in his chambers
and encouraged her to seek mental treatment.</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda Seeks to Rescind Development Vote</HD>
<DH>With a new majority, the council is trying to undo the
previous board's approvals for up to 1,000 homes in the hills.</DH>

<LD>Yorba Linda's new City Council majority, diving into an already
furiously tangled political battle, will try to undo last-minute
approvals for up to 1,000 new homes in the hills above the Riverside
Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Within an hour of being sworn in Tuesday night, Councilwoman Keri
Lynn Wilson joined Mark Ryan and Jim Winder in directing city
attorneys and staff to devise a way to rescind the earlier council
votes.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly this is one of the biggest issues that's faced our
community in the 12 years I've been here. My sense is it was rushed
through in November," Wilson said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to live with the benefits and the consequences
forever, and I think it's important that we seriously evaluate it."</TE>
<TE>   Angry residents who have spent weeks gathering thousands of
signatures to overturn the approvals, by citywide ballot if necessary
said they would still present their petitions at City Hall today, the
deadline for requesting such a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't rely on anything that hasn't happened yet ... so we're
still plugging away," said Tricia Darling, a seven-year resident who
along with her husband has spearheaded the door-to-door campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Shappell Industries of Beverly Hills won approval at
1:30 a.m. on Nov. 6 -- just hours after polls closed on election day
-- to change the city's General Plan. The amendments eliminated open
space in favor of new homes, allowed a major extension to Bastanchury
Road and increased density in the area from about 300 homes to about
1,000 homes, including 385 apartments or townhomes for senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate deal the day before the election, Shappell agreed to
sell 40 acres to the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District
for a long-sought high school and to spend $9 million to $15 million
grading the steep site and bringing in water and power lines.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the developer said they would do everything
necessary to hang onto the approvals, including suing the city if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We will resist any effort to take our entitlements away," said
consulting project manager Lyle Overby.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over the North Yorba Linda Estates development is just
the latest skirmish in an already bitterly divided city. In recent
years there have been unsuccessful petition drives to block the
widening of Imperial Highway and to recall pro-development Councilman
John Gullixson.</TE>
<TE>   As the current drive has gained momentum, so has opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Pickets have appeared outside grocery stores next to the petition
gatherers. Newspaper ads and mailers paid for by Shappell warn that
the referendum would delay construction of the high school for years.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Shappell and a political action committee run
by Overby donated thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to
outgoing Councilman Gullixson and two other councilmen who voted in
favor of the development.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign records show that Gullixson received $4,500 from Shappell
since 1998, and similar donations were made to the other two
supporters, as well as opponent Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides denied any quid-pro-quo arrangement.</TE>

<HD>Ball of Confusion</HD>
<DH>With much of the bowl lineup still in limbo, all eyes will
be on the UCLA-Washington State game, which will affect 13 postseason
games</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pure and simple, we're blaming what the Big Ten Conference pulled
this week on bowl championship series Road Rage.</LD>
<LD>   In prematurely anointing Iowa for a BCS at-large berth and
releasing five schools to make bowl deals Tuesday, the Big Ten was
communicating this:</LD>
<LD>   We're late, we're stuck in traffic, get out of our way because
we're ramrodding Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr's super-charged Buick
Roadmaster through police barricades and telling the BCS to eat our
dust.</LD>
<TE>   Funny, we can't shake this image of a television news helicopter
hovering overhead with its spotlight beamed on the runaway Big Ten
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's Big Ten getaway, there were 17 bowls stuck in
line waiting for two teams to clear a tollgate: UCLA and Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday, the UCLA-Washington State game, moved from Nov. 16
to Saturday, by ABC, had a direct impact on 17 of 28 bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen!</TE>
<TE>   The Big Ten grew so impatient it knocked over orange cones to
reach its destination, specifically putting Iowa in a BCS game five
days early so it could lock Penn State, Michigan, Purdue, Wisconsin
and Minnesota into their bowl slots.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that leaves 13 bowls in limbo (Purdue only solves half of
the Sun Bowl equation; the other spot is tied to the
yet-to-be-determined Pacific 10 team).</TE>
<TE>   All this because UCLA has yet to play Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   No one can remember one game having so much impact.</TE>
<TE>   "No, never," Shawn Schoeffler, a spokesman for the Fiesta and
Insight bowls, said this week. "What's interesting is one conference
game has that much influence. It's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the UCLA-Washington State game will have a domino
effect on the Rose, Sugar, Orange, Holiday, Sun, Insight, Las Vegas,
Silicon Valley, Seattle, Gator, Continental Tire, San Francisco and
Motor City bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: A Washington State win probably puts two Pac-10 teams
in the BCS and probably knocks Notre Dame to the Gator, which changes
the bowl tie-in scenarios for the Pac-10 and Big East conferences.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA wins, the Pac-10 gets only one team in the BCS and that
changes the bowl mix.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how each bowl is affected:</TE>
<TE>   Rose: A UCLA win probably puts USC and Iowa in Pasadena, but a
Washington State victory would leave Washington State vs. Unknown
Opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar: If USC is not in the Rose Bowl, the Sugar might have to
take USC as an automatic at-large pick.</TE>
<TE>   Orange: A UCLA win allows the Orange to take Notre Dame or Kansas
State as an at-large pick; a Washington State victory probably puts
Iowa in the Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday: If UCLA wins, Washington State has a date with Shamu. If
Washington State wins, the Holiday chooses from remaining Pac-10
teams. It could even jump 5-3 Arizona State to take 4-4 UCLA if the
bowl was so moved by a Bruin defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Sun: The Big Ten caper allowed it to sign a deal with Purdue, but
the Sun can't take a Pac-10 team until the Holiday decides.</TE>
<TE>   Insight: Pittsburgh is the likely Big East school, but the Pac-10
team here will depend on what team the Sun Bowl takes.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas: Has to wait for the Insight.</TE>
<TE>   Silicon Valley: Has to wait for Las Vegas. The Silicon Valley had
secured a $1.5-million line of credit this week to stay accredited.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle: This is no longer a Pac-10 affiliated bowl, but it's a
fallback for Oregon if Washington State loses and drops to the
Holiday. The Seattle Bowl, like the Silicon, is on shaky financial
ground but appears it will be able to stage a game, at least this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Gator: North Carolina State is the Atlantic Coast Conference
school, but the other spot goes to either the Big East or Notre Dame.
If Notre Dame gets a BCS bid, the Gator would get West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Continental Tire: If Notre Dame ends up in the Gator, West
Virginia falls here.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco: Boston College or Virginia Tech, depending on what
happens to Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Motor City: Boston College or Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   So, as you see, Washington State at UCLA is more than a game to
determine the Pac-10 champion and, perhaps, Bruin Coach Bob Toledo's
fate.</TE>
<TE>   Think of all the agents with a vested interest.</TE>
<TE>   Not sports agents, travel agents.</TE>
<TE>   Miami Twice</TE>
<TE>   Miami loses but wins....</TE>
<TE>   Holy Nebraska, could it happen again?</TE>
<TE>   They used to say you could lose a game early in the college game
and remain in national title contention, but don't dare lose a game
late.</TE>
<TE>   That theory is all but BCS bunk now that the championship game is
affected by computers, which downloaded Nebraska to the Rose Bowl
last year after a 62-36 loss to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers went from bummed out in Boulder one week to waving
to Regis in the Rose parade.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, we here at Scenario Central are trying to figure out
why that couldn't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knows that if Miami beats Virginia Tech on Saturday the
Hurricanes will play Ohio State for the national title in the Jan. 3
Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a chance Miami could lose and still get to Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   This will not come as peachy news to fans of Georgia, who are
hoping a Miami loss would vault the Bulldogs to the Fiesta Bowl
(provided Georgia beats Arkansas in the Southeastern Conference title
game).</TE>
<TE>   Let's look at the math here.</TE>
<TE>   Miami is No. 1 in this week's BCS standings with 3.53 points, a
healthy 5.50 ahead of No. 3 Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami loses a close game to Virginia Tech, the key would be how
far the Hurricanes fell in the Associated Press and coaches' polls.
Remember, it would Miami's first defeat in 34 games.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami dropped to No. 4 in both human polls behind Ohio State,
Iowa and Georgia, it would lose three BCS poll average points, plus
one point for the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia would gain a full point in the poll average, and then it
might come down to a decimal-point battle.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Nebraska edged Colorado for the No. 2 spot by 0.05 of a
point, while the year before Florida State eked out a 0.32 win over
No. 3 Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's chances would be enhanced if it only fell to No. 3 in the
polls, ahead of Georgia. Pollsters could justify it this way: Both
schools have one loss, and both played Florida. Miami crushed Florida
while Georgia lost to the Gators.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami and Georgia lose, USC's chances for a national title
berth also would be affected by how far Miami fell in the polls. The
Trojans' hopes would probably hinge on whether they could beat out
Miami for the No. 3 poll spot. Voting writers and coaches, though,
might be reluctant to drop one-loss Miami below two-loss USC.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Here is the doomsday scenario that knocks USC out of the No. 4 BCS
spot and possibly a major bowl. Washington State beats UCLA and
Virginia Tech defeats Miami in a close game. Washington State goes to
the Rose Bowl. If Miami only drops a few spots in the polls but still
stays at No. 2 in the BCS, the Hurricanes would play Ohio State for
the national title. If Miami wedged between Iowa and USC in the
polls, Iowa might reclaim the No. 4 spot in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   With Ohio State now No. 1, the Rose Bowl takes Iowa to play
Washington State and the Orange Bowl is left to select among USC,
Notre Dame or Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be a shock in this case if the Orange Bowl took Kansas
State, which defeated USC and would bring far more fans to the game.</TE>
<TE>   Word is that Kansas State might beat Notre Dame out of the Orange
Bowl in any scenario. Kansas State, ranked ahead of Notre Dame in the
polls and the BCS, is promising to caravan thousands of fans to South
Florida, who will tote back enough souvenirs to open a gift shop in
Manhattan, Kan. A packed stadium is a must for the Orange Bowl, which
has drawn an average of 5,000 less than capacity in years when it has
not hosted the BCS title game. ABC might have sway, though, and the
network probably would favor the higher ratings Notre Dame would
garner.</TE>
<TE>   The Silicon Valley and Seattle bowls avoided possible cancellation
by securing the $1.5-million line of credit each needed to, um, pay
the host teams. This comes as a relief to the Pac-10 as the
conference is set to send its No. 6 team to the Silicon Valley Bowl,
to face Fresno State. The Seattle Bowl is a fallback for Oregon in
case Washington State loses and falls to the Holiday Bowl. Pac-10
Commissioner Tom Hansen said this week there would have been a "mad
scramble" to place teams if either or both bowls were not certified.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, on its Web site, the Silicon Valley boasts of
being "the best college football bowl game on the West Coast," which
would be news to the Rose Bowl and every other West Coast bowl game
ever conceived, with the exception of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Snooping around. Why do we think the Orange Bowl might take Iowa
from the Rose Bowl should Miami and Washington State win? This week,
Orange Bowl officials called the Sun Bowl to find out how well Iowa
traveled when the Hawkeyes played in El Paso in 1995 and 1997. The
Orange Bowl was told Iowa traveled very well.</TE>
<TE>   R.C. Slocum's firing at Texas A&amp;M should have coaches choking on
their whistles. The message is clear: If Slocum can get fired, anyone
can.</TE>
<TE>   Though he had a mediocre 6-6 season, Slocum leaves as the
winningest coach in A&amp;M history with a record of 123-47-2. He never
had a losing season. Truth is, winning records aren't good enough at
some schools, as UCLA's Toledo may soon find out. Sometimes alumni
simply grow weary of a coach and want a new one. Wouldn't it be
better, really, if you could lease instead of buy? UCLA fans
clamoring for a coaching change need to know this: The next coach
won't come cheap. The days of UCLA saving money by bumping up eager
assistants (read Toledo and basketball Coach Steve Lavin), ended the
day USC agreed to pay Pete Carroll more than one $1 million a season.
We expect the next UCLA coach, if there is one, will start the
bidding there.</TE>

<HD>Energy Crisis Leaves Lakers in the Dark</HD>
<DH>O'Neal says team is not playing with enough fire after
93-85 loss to the Jazz leaves L.A. with 7-13 record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Then another game was gone, 20 now, and another loss was hung, their
13th, and the Lakers are left scrounging for what they can no longer
be sure is their true game.</LD>
<LD>   The Utah Jazz defeated the Lakers, 93-85, on Wednesday night at
Delta Center.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson pointedly blamed the referees.</LD>
<TE>   The Laker players glumly took responsibility. They shot 35.7% from
the field. They scored 13 points in the third quarter. They had 16
turnovers. Having pretty much mastered the Memphis Grizzlies but
otherwise without joy, they've won two games going on two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   They are 7-13, their season nearly a quarter gone, the whole
league ahead of them, it seems, and nothing has improved but their
postgame calm.</TE>
<TE>   Utah's Karl Malone had 29 points and 15 rebounds and John Stockton
had 11 assists, enough to overwhelm Shaquille O'Neal's 23 points and
15 rebounds and Kobe Bryant's 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two 40-year-olds ran us into the ground," Bryant said, but
it wasn't quite true.</TE>
<TE>   Malone is 39.</TE>
<TE>   None of which put O'Neal into much of a mood. Playing on the
second of back-to-back nights (the Lakers are 0-5 in them) and now at
altitude, O'Neal appeared to require great effort to challenge shots
and get off his own. He missed 15 of 23 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't make excuses," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he's O'Neal. And Bryant's Bryant. And that's not enough.
Apparently not nearly.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are in last place in the Pacific Division again. The
worst record through 20 games by a team that eventually won an NBA
championship is 11-9, by the 1946-47 Philadelphia Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   So, O'Neal is beginning to be unhappy with the players around him.
In fact, he appears to be wondering if they are the right players to
have around him.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he believed the players who could play the Lakers into a
fourth consecutive NBA title were in his locker room, he turned his
head, stared straight at the questioner, and said, "No comment."</TE>
<TE>   Just that.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want eight guys out there with me who want to play," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, it has looked bad. O'Neal returned from surgery on his
toe and they have won four of eight games. The schedule won't wait.
They'll play Dallas on Friday at home. Utah's back Sunday. It's
months before they'll get the Grizzlies again.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that the whole team is not playing with enough
energy or enough fire," O'Neal said, a frequent complaint lately.
"I'd like to touch the ball more too, especially when I'm shooting
seven for 10 from the line."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak said this week that he would not
rush into a trade, that the Lakers' core players deserved more time.
But the Lakers continued to take hits at power forward, where
Wednesday Slava Medvedenko injured the pinkie on his shooting hand
and could be out six weeks. Samaki Walker, who has a strained lower
back, could come off the injured list for Friday's game, but that's
not assured.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker bench generally has been overrun, though Tracy Murray
got his first significant minutes (12) in more than a month and made
all four of his shots, including three three-pointers, and scored 11
points.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really no excuse," O'Neal said. "We're all professionals
and we have to be ready. You know, it seems like sometimes we have
five out there and a couple of guys don't know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's what leads to 20 missed shots in the third quarter.
Or the fact that every time the Lakers drew close in the fourth
quarter, Malone would find a wide-open jumper. Bryant, perhaps still
on rickety knees, missed nine of 14 shots. Devean George had two
points and four fouls in nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was the back-to-back games. Perhaps it was Jackson's
decision to fly the day of the game, coupling a late night with an
early-morning flight. Perhaps these are the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "From night to night, there's a decision to be made," forward Rick
Fox said, "if you're going to come and compete and play to the best
of your ability. Or not."</TE>
<TE>   For six weeks they've complained about their lack of effort, their
failure to play the game, their inability to hit a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game we say we're going to stop the bleeding," Brian Shaw
said. "We've not been able to stop it."</TE>

<HD>With Trade Completed, It's All Tracy's Team Now</HD>

<LD>This trade wasn't only about payroll wars.</LD>
<LD>   It's also about clubhouse peace.</LD>
<LD>   Looking at the deal that sent the burdensome contracts of Dodgers
Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs for Todd
Hundley and Chad Hermansen, fans see only green.</LD>
<TE>   But the Dodgers are also seeing red.</TE>
<TE>   That was the color of Manager Jim Tracy's face when dealing with
an unhappy Grudzielanek, who challenged Tracy often last year about
decreased playing time and lower spots in the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are also seeing black.</TE>
<TE>   That was their mood when Karros was unhappy with how Tracy was
running the club, and unafraid to tell the manager about it.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody will say it, but the front office believes it.</TE>
<TE>   Karros and Grudzielanek were considered two of the three players
who represented the greatest challenge to Tracy's authority.</TE>
<TE>   After enduring the daily wrath of Raul Mondesi and Gary Sheffield,
the Dodgers were weary of such challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The third worrisome player, Kevin Brown, has a contract that
cannot be dealt.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Dodgers found someone to take the other two guys,
even for a couple of role players, they were thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does this give them the payroll space to purchase a
free-agent hitter like Jeff Kent or Cliff Floyd, but they also feel
they bought more time for Tracy to earn the clubhouse respect that is
essential for a championship.</TE>
<TE>   If Karros hits 30 homers and Grudzielanek bats .300 in Chicago
while Tracy struggles as he did during the last two Septembers, the
perspective may change.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the Dodgers' aim is to give peace -- and their
still-growing manager -- a chance.</TE>
<TE>   While Grudzielanek wasn't here long enough to make a lasting
impact -- many folks still can't even spell his name -- the concern
is that management's view will taint Karros' legacy.</TE>
<TE>   It should not.</TE>
<TE>   In 12 years here, he did nothing to publicly diminish himself or
the Dodger image.</TE>
<TE>   When I first met him in the spring of 1992, he was a rookie who
took every long bus trip, who attended every late-afternoon session
of Lasorda University, who never publicly complained.</TE>
<TE>   When I last saw him last fall, struggling at the plate and booed
nightly, he was the same person.</TE>
<TE>   Always affable, always approachable, always willing to talk about
the Dodger Way, even long after the Dodger Way had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he never won a playoff game, he was old-fashioned
Dodger, maybe the last Dodger, with a club career home run record
that could last forever and a portrait that belongs on the outfield
wall.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger officials know this, and respect it, and would love to
have him return to the organization after his playing days are
finished.</TE>
<TE>   "He represents so many good things about the Dodgers," said Dan
Evans, general manager.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that, well, they thought he had worn out his welcome in
the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe he had.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't in the lineup, he burned. And when Tracy didn't
manage the way he might have managed, he seethed.</TE>
<TE>   Though publicly a prince, privately he was admittedly tough on
management, a fresh young face who slowly became a bit of a
curmudgeon.</TE>
<TE>   When Mike Piazza was traded in 1998, the clubhouse should have
belonged to Karros, but Sheffield showed up, and it became a
clubhouse divided.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield accused Karros of not playing hard, Karros scowled back,
and the team lost.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Sheffield was traded, Tracy made certain everyone knew
that it was his team, and Karros buckled a little more.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Karros and Tracy had several loud meetings in the
manager's office about everything from playing time to lineups.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, as a sign of Karros' discomfort with Dodger
management, he gave up a $9-million option for 2004 based on playing
time, and settled for a $1-million buyout. He was worried that the
threat of a big payday would make the Dodgers bench him.</TE>
<TE>   Karros and Tracy ended their time together as friends, but the
stage had been set for bigger problems this season, especially with
Karros possibly being platooned for the first time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a very honest relationship with Jim, we were both very
candid," said Karros. "But there is nobody I respected more."</TE>
<TE>   Karros did not deny that they had several discussions about the
club.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very honest with me, and I was very honest with him,"
Karros said. "But did I ever influence a decision or make out a
lineup for him? Saying that is an insult to Tracy."</TE>
<TE>   The manager was hunting in Ohio on Wednesday and could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But he will certainly have more control of the clubhouse culture
without Karros and Grudzielanek.</TE>
<TE>   And, in Chicago, both players will have chances to reinvent
themselves at the end of their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Evans has the money to find a hitter who Karros could
no longer be, and the Dodgers can throw him a nice home-plate party
on the Cubs' first trip into town.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved in trades, fearful of insulting the other party,
always claims that the deal is good for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   This time, amazingly, they're right.</TE>

<HD>Class May Be Out in a 151-5 Rout</HD>
<DH>Stoneridge Prep, a Southern Section finalist last season,
pours it on against South Bay High.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The coach scheduled a special game for his team's season opener,
agreeing to play a small-school powerhouse because he thought his
undermanned team would benefit from the experience of seeing how high
school basketball is supposed to be played -- what a strong opponent
looks like and how a successful program conducts itself.</LD>
<LD>   What Coach Stephen Moore and South Bay High got instead was a
151-5 shellacking at the hands of Stoneridge Prep on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   South Bay's five points were the fewest ever by a Southern Section
boys' team, while Stoneridge Prep, which advanced to the Division V-A
championship game last season, tied the Southern Section record for
points in a game.</LD>
<TE>   And that lesson? It was a different kind of high school basketball
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Moore was upset Wednesday that Stoneridge Prep continued to play
aggressively on offense and defense, even when the lead was as large
as 70-3 late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "At which point does it become ridiculous?" Moore said. "Are you
guys trying to prove a point? Are we really working on sportsmanship
and team ball here?"</TE>
<TE>   Teaching is especially important at South Bay, a residential
facility in Torrance with an enrollment of 56 students. Most of the
students are wards of juvenile court, kids who come from "extremely
abusive or neglectful backgrounds," Moore said, and have mothers or
fathers who have had their parenting rights terminated in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   South Bay had 10 players on the team, including three girls, one
of whom started at small forward.</TE>
<TE>   South Bay committed 64 turnovers, almost all of them leading to
easy baskets for Stoneridge Prep, which accentuated some breakaways
with thunderous dunks and alley-oop passes.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneridge Prep Coach Ron Slater, in his first year at the private
Tarzana school of 45 students, did not feel his team did anything
inappropriate. He said he called off a full-court press after the
first quarter, with the score, 36-3, but continued to employ an
aggressive half-court man-to-man defense throughout the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because we're not playing a good team, I still want my guys
playing good fundamental defense," Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   Slater said his top players sat out most of the second and fourth
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneridge Prep had only eight players Tuesday and was without
star point guard Leon Usher. Senior guard James Spencer led the team
with 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   Moore has been at South Bay since shortly after the school opened
six years ago and has coached basketball there for three years. His
teams have won three or four games and lost about 45 -- he doesn't
know the exact numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't run a program that focuses only on winning," Moore said.
"I need to maintain more therapeutic goals, such as teamwork,
sportsmanship, the things the [Southern Section] would like schools
to focus on.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of emotional support [in the players' pasts],
or positive experiences with a lot of people -- they're troubled kids
from tough backgrounds."</TE>
<TE>   Moore said South Bay opponents usually slow the tempo if a game
gets out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past we've played teams that have recognized who these
kids are, and when they steal the ball from us, they'll cut to the
basket but then pull it out and set up a play," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Slater did not consider that option. "I don't tell my guys, 'Don't
go score, just hold the ball,' " he said. "That would be taking away
from my guys."</TE>
<TE>   The teams shook hands after the game, which was played at Sylmar
High, but not everybody was happy. A South Bay player who argued with
fans afterward was lectured about his behavior upon returning to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with South Bay players are not allowed because of
confidentiality reasons, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneridge Prep Principal Maria Arnold said she would not have
approved of a game against South Bay if she had known of the
differences between the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not know exactly who we were playing," Arnold said. "If I
knew, we would have never played them. It's not fair to them."</TE>
<TE>   South Bay Principal Edward R. Wilson said the score was "run up
... it should have been called at the half."</TE>
<TE>   Slater said he would have been open to such a suggestion. "It
wasn't my intention to run the score up," Slater said. "They could
have came to me at halftime and said it was out of hand. We could
have stopped it then."</TE>
<TE>   There have been other lopsided basketball games.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1982, Cheryl Miller scored 105 points for Riverside
Poly in a 179-15 victory over Riverside Norte Vista.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1990, Lisa Leslie scored 101 points for Inglewood
Morningside in the first half of a game against South Torrance.
Morningside led at halftime, 102-24, and South Torrance decided not
to take the court for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, there were two blowouts on the same day in January
2001: Heritage Christian Academy, near Houston, defeated Banff
Private School, 178-28, and Dajuan Wagner of Camden, N.J., scored 100
points in a 157-67 victory over Gloucester Township Technical School.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Moore regretted saying yes to a game against
Stoneridge Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "I started our team off with a tough game because I wanted to show
them what high school basketball looks like," Moore said. "I wanted
it to be a learning tool, so our kids can understand what it takes to
win and play better. But the final score was horrid."</TE>

<HD>Deal Gives Dodgers Flex Factor</HD>
<DH>Karros and Grudzielanek are traded to Cubs for Hundley and
Hermansen, which frees up some money for Evans to make a play for
Kent or Floyd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers felt liberated Wednesday after completing a four-player
trade with the Chicago Cubs that brightened the off-season outlook at
Chavez Ravine.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans expressed the upbeat mood of the
organization once first baseman Eric Karros and second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek -- along with $2 million in cash -- were officially sent
to Chicago for catcher Todd Hundley and outfielder Chad Hermansen,
reveling in the club's newfound roster and payroll flexibility this
winter. The deal was finalized when Chicago gave Karros a no-trade
clause and Grudzielanek's contract was slightly altered to match the
Cubs' fiscal calendar.</LD>
<LD>   Karros and Grudzielanek will receive $8 million and $5.5 million,
respectively, under the final guaranteed seasons of their contracts.
The cash in the transaction covers $1.5 million in option buyouts.
Hundley has a salary of $6 million in 2003 and $6.5 million in 2004,
so the Dodgers have more room to maneuver for next season.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, the Dodgers still are burdened by past mistakes and
created only a little breathing room in agreeing to exchange
high-priced headaches with the Cubs, but Evans believes they're
better off now. The money that would have gone to Karros and
Grudzielanek in 2003 could help the Dodgers address their long to-do
list, and Evans is eager to reinvest in a team he believes is a
"playoff contender" next season.</TE>
<TE>   However, Evans said the Dodgers won't rush into anything despite
the availability of free agents Jeff Kent and Cliff Floyd, who might
not fit into their plan with the luxury tax looming. The Dodgers are
moving to improve the team and that's their focus, but they're
enjoying the freedom of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We achieved our first goal in the off-season, and now we suddenly
have choices we didn't have earlier," Evans said. "This gives us some
freedom, not a lot, but enough to explore some things we couldn't do
prior to this.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a number of spots to fill on our roster, and we were
very limited in our flexibility. This trade doesn't give us an
unlimited amount of money, but it gives us enough to at least do some
things that we think will improve our team."</TE>
<TE>   Signing Kent or Floyd could help.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger officials acknowledged that the batting order could use a
run-producing right-handed hitter such as Kent, and All-Star right
fielder Shawn Green would welcome the help.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed-batting Floyd, who played for Manager Jim Tracy in
the Montreal Expo farm system, is another intriguing option. The
Dodgers have almost $90 million committed to only 11 players for next
season, starter Odalis Perez and third baseman Adrian Beltre are
among those eligible for arbitration and Evans is determined to keep
the Dodgers under next season's luxury-tax threshold of about $117
million.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most baseball officials doubted the Dodgers could trade
Karros and Grudzielanek, so Evans won't rule out anything at this
point.</TE>
<TE>   "They're among the pool of players we're looking at," he said of
the top remaining position players on the market. "As far as
specifically [what] we feel on those players, we'll make those
decisions and we'll come up with ideas as to whether or not they're
the guys. I'm not ready to make that commitment to any players right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Although proceeding cautiously on the next phase of their plan,
the Dodgers are staying in touch with Kent and Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it fascinating," said Kent's agent, Jeff Klein, of the
possible match with the Dodgers. "He wants the best winning situation
for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Kent -- the 2000 National League most valuable player -- has
primarily played second base throughout his career, but Klein said he
has "an open mind about playing first because he played a lot of
first base for San Francisco and played it well."</TE>
<TE>   Seth Levinson, who represents Floyd and has a good relationship
with Evans and Chairman Bob Daly, told the Dodgers he would structure
a contract for Floyd that would address the club's luxury-tax
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Evans has a view and a direction and a plan," said Karros,
who Evans said has a standing offer for a position in the
organization once he retires. "Whether you agree with the plan or
don't agree with the plan, at least there is a plan.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as he sticks to it, he'll either be the beneficiary of
the results or he'll die by the results. But at least he knows what
he wants to do. I guess in time everybody we'll see if it works out."</TE>

<HD>23 Arrested in Arson, Insurance Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>The ring started more than 50 fires, authorities say. The
sweeps follow a two-year probe.</DH>

<LD>Two suspected ringleaders and 21 associates have been arrested in an
arson and insurance-fraud scheme responsible for more than 50 fires
in the Los Angeles area, sheriff's investigators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "At first, these guys chased fires that weren't arson, getting
people whose homes had burned to sign over their insurance money,"
said Det. Ed Nordskog of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"Business was good, but they realized it would be a lot better if
they started their own fires."</LD>
<LD>   So the ringleaders of the scheme got into the arson business, in
most cases recruiting relatives, friends and business associates who
agreed to have their places torched, Nordskog said.</LD>
<TE>   The homes burned were mostly in modest neighborhoods in
South-Central Los Angeles, Bellflower, Downey, Lynwood and South
Gate. A few small businesses also were burned, detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged ringleaders, Francisco Hernandez, 31, of Bellflower,
and Ignacio Navarro, 35, of Los Angeles, were among the first taken
into custody last week after a two-year investigation by the
Sheriff's Department, the county and Downey fire departments, the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the National
Insurance Crime Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone else arrested so far has been related to those guys by
marriage or by birth," Nordskog said.</TE>
<TE>   The detective said that in the beginning, Hernandez, Navarro and a
couple of associates "were just your typical vultures," victimizing
innocent people who were left traumatized by the loss of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys would arrive with a handful of money," Nordskog said.
"They'd tell the people to watch out for the insurance companies,
then hand them the cash and get them to sign over their insurance
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   The benefits always were more than the cash they had handed over,
the detective said. That led to a grander scheme to burn the homes,
vehicles and businesses of friends and relatives, and submit inflated
insurance claims, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make even more money, the ringleaders got into the free-lance
claims-adjustment and contracting businesses, billing insurance
companies for top-dollar rebuilding, then doing cheap repairs and
pocketing the difference, Nordskog said.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, they started ripping off the people whose places
they burned, stopped sharing the insurance money with them," the
detective said. "Those people didn't go to the cops, because they
were involved in the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   But arson investigators determined that a lot of house fires had
been set, and police caught two men fleeing an arson in Lynwood. "The
investigation spread from there," Nordskog said.</TE>

<HD>Guilty Plea Expected by Ex-Official in Seal Beach</HD>
<DH>Shawn Boyd, a Seal Beach councilman until he lost a March
election, has agreed to a deal with the state Fair Political
Practices Commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd is expected to plead guilty
to a felony conflict-of-interest charge and pay a $25,000 state fine
for voting on matters that benefited a business partner, according to
documents filed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, who lost his council seat in the March election, agreed to
the terms in a stipulation deal he signed last month with the state
Fair Political Practices Commission, according to state records.</LD>
<LD>   "This stipulation is part of a global settlement reached in
cooperation with the Orange County district attorney's office,"
concludes the seven-page agreement signed by Boyd and commission
Executive Director Mark Krausse.</LD>
<TE>   The panel will formally adopt the terms of the agreement at its
Dec. 13 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges had been filed against Boyd as of Wednesday,
and officials at the Orange County district attorney's office
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, two sources knowledgeable about the case said Boyd is
expected to be charged and plead guilty Dec. 13. Boyd couldn't be
reached for comment. His attorney, Allan H. Stokke, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into Boyd began in October 2001 after a
complaint was filed by a local activist over the councilman's
relationship with developer Richard Hall, who owned the Seal Beach
Trailer Park.</TE>
<TE>   Between January 2001 and June 2001, Boyd voted several times to
use city funds to help a nonprofit group buy the park from Hall.
However, Boyd failed to disclose that he had been paid $104,000 by
Hall for consulting, government-relations work and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars elected officials who receive $500 or more in
income within the previous year from voting or influencing decisions
on matters that could financially benefit the giver. The prohibition
includes money paid to or formally promised to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Hall made a profit of more than $4 million on the sale of the
park, which he bought in December 1998 for $2.9 million. He sold it
in December 2000 for $7.45 million to the nonprofit group, which used
$6.4 million in city-backed revenue bonds and a $1-million state
grant.</TE>
<TE>   Council members agreed to help with the sale because the park
provided the city's only designated affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd voted seven times and abstained four other times on park
matters without disclosing his work for Hall to his colleagues or on
required state financial forms. He said he didn't tell his colleagues
because he feared the information would be used against him
politically.</TE>
<TE>   Each of Boyd's votes were counted against him in the commission
stipulation, plus an eighth count of failing to disclose Hall as a
source of income on required annual conflict-of-interest forms.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd lost his bid for reelection in March after serving one
four-year term. He came in third out of four candidates and was
replaced by county planner Charles Antos.</TE>

<HD>Airport Panel May Seek FAA Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still wrestling over a decision to scrap plans for a new passenger
terminal at Burbank Airport, members of the airport authority on
Wednesday proposed sending a delegation to Washington to seek advice
on how to resolve their differences.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena were joined by
dozens of area residents at a public meeting at the Glendale Hilton
to discuss last month's controversial decision by the Burbank Airport
Authority. The panel voted 5 to 4 to drop a two-decade effort to
replace the airport's aging terminal, citing a lack of community
support.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, however, Burbank city officials have been pushing to
resurrect the proposal, which they see as key to reducing airport
noise. They believe the Federal Aviation Administration would be more
likely to permit nighttime flight curfews if a new and safer terminal
were built.</LD>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, Burbank City Councilman Jef Vander Borght
said the cities should join together in approaching federal officials
about the terminal relocation plan, flight curfews and other issues
regarding the airport. By doing so, he said, they would more likely
get a desirable result.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face reality. [Burbank Airport] is a small, regional
airport," Vander Borght said. "We can get lost in the shuffle. We
need to present a united front."</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the Glendale City Council appeared Wednesday to
side with Burbank officials regarding the need for a new terminal.
"The terminal there is antiquated and it's time for a new terminal,"
Councilman Bob Yousefian said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the authority should drop any plans to sell an adjacent
parcel that the authority purchased from Lockheed as the site for a
new terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through a lot to purchase that property," Yousefian said.
"You're not going to find a property like that to come across the
table in many, many years. I want to keep the land.'</TE>
<TE>   Because only three of Pasadena's seven City Council members were
present at the meeting, they said they would take the suggestion for
a Washington delegation back for consideration by the full council.
If they agree, a delegation could be sent to Washington next year.</TE>
<TE>   In voting to drop plans for the new terminal, the airport
authority cited strong community opposition in Burbank. It said the
only way the plan would be resurrected was if the FAA mandated that
the terminal be moved for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank's three appointees on the authority all voted to keep
pushing for a new passenger facility. Each of the cities has three
representatives on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank officials say they were informally advised by the FAA that
a new terminal would help win approval for airline curfews. The FAA
has not reached a decision on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The airport is studying the costs and benefits of imposing curfews
on nighttime flights. Such a study is required by law before the FAA
could consider whether to permit such restrictions on airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials launched plans more than 20 years ago to replace
the aging passenger terminal because portions of the facility are
within 300 feet of one runway. Current airport building standards
require a distance of at least 750 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the airport authority spent $86 million to purchase a
130-acre parcel previously used by Lockheed for building military
aircraft. That same year, the authority reached a tentative agreement
with Burbank to build a replacement terminal in exchange for closing
the facility between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. to reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   But that plan was opposed by the FAA, which viewed the move as a
de facto curfew, restricted under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Burbank voters complicated negotiations by approving
Measure A, which prohibited the City Council from approving new
construction or renovation of the airport unless a curfew was
imposed. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge recently declared
the measure unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But Measure B, which Burbank voters passed in November 2000, still
requires their approval of any plans for a new terminal.</TE>

<CX>   Burbank Airport--An article in the California section on Thursday
incorrectly stated that the Burbank Airport Authority has proposed
sending a delegation to Washington to seek advice on differences
regarding a new passenger terminal. City officials from Burbank,
Glendale and Pasadena made the proposal, not the nine-member
authority, which includes city appointees.</CX>

<HD>List of Busway Routes Cut to 5</HD>
<DH>North-south line would deliver riders to other Valley
transit services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving closer to creation of a north-south busway in the San Fernando
Valley, a team of Metropolitan Transportation Authority staff and
consultants has narrowed a list of 13 possible routes down to five,
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The five potential routes are Reseda, Sepulveda, Van Nuys and
Lankershim boulevards, and an old rail corridor that parallels Canoga
Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified after a series of community meetings for a
transit corridor study. The MTA team is expected to recommend a top
choice to the agency's board early next year.</LD>
<TE>   The route is intended to connect riders in the north Valley to the
east-west busway -- projected to open in 2005 -- as well as to the
popular Metro Rapid bus service along Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is holding three public meetings next week to gather
community input: Tuesday at Sherman Oaks Women's Club, 4808 Kester
Ave.; Wednesday at Pierce College Campus Center, 6201 Winnetka Ave.
in Woodland Hills; and Dec. 12 at Recreation Park, 208 Park Ave., in
San Fernando. The meetings all start at 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Chase's Tragic Consequences Outrage Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A police chase that resulted in a crash that severed the arm of a
baby boy roused Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton to demand
harsh punishment Wednesday for the driver of the car that rammed the
vehicle carrying the infant.</LD>
<LD>   "Hang 'em high," an outraged Bratton said in an interview
Wednesday on public radio station KPCC-FM (89.3). Bratton said his
department would thoroughly review all the circumstances leading up
to the crash, which he called "a tragedy for the family."</LD>
<LD>   But in his blunt style, the chief echoed earlier comments by
Police Commission President Rick Caruso that pursuing officers cannot
look the other way when a crime is committed and said suspects
fleeing police should face mandatory jail time.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a Catch-22. You can't let [criminals] run amok," Bratton
said, adding that police pursuits are too often treated like
entertainment in Los Angeles rather than criminal activity. "As far
as that character yesterday, hang 'em high."</TE>
<TE>   At a later news conference, Bratton said he met with the family of
the injured boy on Wednesday and planned to do so again today. He
also defended the pursuing officers for doing their job.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are out there to control crime," he said. "The reality
is we have people out there breaking the law. We have to enforce the
law. This individual yesterday was wanted for [an attempted] murder.
Are we going to let him flee? I think not."</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Martinez, 26, the driver of the Chevrolet Corsica that
collided with the sport utility vehicle carrying the infant and his
parents, was fleeing the scene of a stabbing in Sylmar at the time of
the accident Tuesday afternoon, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, being held in lieu of $500,000 bail, is expected to be
charged today with attempted murder in connection with the stabbing
and could face additional charges stemming from the chase and
subsequent collision.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 19-day-old baby underwent surgery Wednesday morning
to clean and patch up his injured left arm, which was severed just
above the elbow, said hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge. He remains
in serious condition.</TE>
<TE>   The child's distraught parents requested that their names not be
released, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents are doing as well as anyone would in their
situation," Rutledge said. "It's very difficult for them. They seem
to have a very large, supportive extended family, who has been here
for them."</TE>
<TE>   Rutledge said plastic surgeons have examined the child's arm and
are exploring ways to make it "amenable to a prosthetic, but that's
way down the road."</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators were still piecing together the circumstances
surrounding the crash in Sylmar. But they said all indications were
that the 2 1/2-minute pursuit was consistent with Police Department
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials said officers spotted Martinez's car about 2:30
p.m. Tuesday. The vehicle matched the description of one driven by
suspects in a stabbing minutes earlier in the 13200 block of Maclay
Avenue in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   But the chase unfolded so quickly that there was not enough time
to consult with a supervising officer or to dispatch an air unit to
pick up the chase, said Deputy Chief George Gascon.</TE>
<TE>   He added that it appeared the officers' actions would have
complied even with more stringent pursuit guidelines the department
is considering.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current policy, individual officers have wide discretion
to initiate a chase, whether the suspects are involved in a minor
infraction or a dangerous felony.</TE>
<TE>   The officer must weigh the potential threat to bystanders against
the need to make an arrest, taking into account traffic, pedestrians
and the danger posed by the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of high-profile collisions and a significant
increase in injuries arising from police pursuits, the department is
weighing a more restrictive policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has what is considered
a highly restrictive pursuit policy.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's spokesman Darren Harris said that when deputies initiate
a pursuit, they are required to tell commanders their speed, location
and reasons for a chase, including what law was violated by the
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   They also must relay a vehicle description and license plate as
well as communicate the number of vehicle occupants and traffic
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The watch commander will take that information and determine
whether it falls within department guidelines," Harris said. "The
deputies also have discretion to cancel a pursuit at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the LAPD's Gascon stressed that police officers have a
delicate balancing act.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned and we want to look at where can we adjust
the policy to enhance public safety without the unintended
consequence of increasing the danger to the community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he wants Gov. Gray Davis to increase jail time for
those who flee from police.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said state law
provides for a mandatory six-month jail sentence for anyone convicted
of evading police, with a one-year cap for chases that end without
injury.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an injury, an additional charge [of willful flight
causing injury] provides up to five years" in state prison, Jane
Robison said.</TE>

for a bus to go to the mall, having turned down a ride from his
father.</LD>
<LD>   Out of school early, Junior -- as everyone called him -- wanted to
take the bus with two friends.</LD>
<LD>   Junior was a basketball player. He hoped to play for the NBA.
First, he intended to attend UCLA, his mother's alma mater. He was
already saving money for college textbooks. He got mostly A's at
Crenshaw High School. He wore suits to church. He was not a gang
member.</LD>
<TE>   On Nov. 21, Junior stood with his two friends in front of Magees
Donut Shop on South Western Avenue near Vernon Avenue when he was
approached by another teenager. Authorities say it was Antwaine
Butler, 17, a member of the Rollin' 40s Crips. An exchange of words
led to a scuffle. Losing the fight in front of two gang cohorts,
Butler pulled out a handgun and shot Junior in the chest and head,
police say.</TE>
<TE>   Police have an arrest warrant out for Butler and are seeking to
interview his fellow gang members.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks since Junior's death, he has become a poster child
against gang violence. In a news conference announcing a crackdown on
gangs earlier this week, Mayor James K. Hahn stood at the lectern
flanked by Junior's family.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the death of Clive Jackson be a call to action," Hahn said as
Junior's parents wept.</TE>
<TE>   Junior's father, Clive Jackson Sr., was at the carwash less than
two blocks away when Junior was gunned down. Shooting at the bus
stop, someone said. Jackson raced over. He found his son lying with
his face covered.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart stopped," said Jackson, 42, general manager and
executive chef for a catering company. "I'm lost, really. What kind
of world are we living in?"</TE>
<TE>   Junior intended to go to the mall to get T-shirts for a
Thanksgiving vacation trip to New Orleans that his father had
planned.</TE>
<TE>   Usually Jackson dropped his son off wherever he wanted to go. Why
didn't he insist this time? he asked himself over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be fine for a kid to hop on the bus without worrying
that he is going to get killed," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Jackson remarried earlier this fall, he brought Junior with
him to the bank to withdraw money for the engagement ring.</TE>
<TE>   Junior, after all, would be the best man at the wedding. Jackson
told Junior to put the money in his pocket. At the jeweler's, he and
his son picked out a ring and Junior plunked down all the cash. His
father gently scolded him, "You have to count it first," he told him.</TE>
<TE>   It was, Jackson thought, an indication of Junior's trusting
nature. Here was his son, whose heroes were Kobe Bryant and Michael
Jordan, assuming that the world was honest and good.</TE>
<TE>   Junior was born and raised in the same South Los Angeles
neighborhood where he was killed. He attended Martin Luther King Jr.
Elementary School and Audubon Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always calm; he knew to avoid trouble," said his half
sister, Monique Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Junior spent most of his week with Monique and their mother,
Sharon Smith, 42, an operations manager at a bank in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   But he adored his new stepbrother, 5-year-old Blair. He and Blair
played baseball, which was Blair's sport, and basketball, which was
clearly Junior's game -- he was a member of Crenshaw's freshman
basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Junior's death, Jackson and his new wife tried
to explain to Blair what happened. Whenever anyone called their
Baldwin Hills home, Blair would pick up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know Junior died?" Blair would ask. Then he'd say,
"Junior is not going to ride his bike anymore. Junior is not going to
wear his nice clothes anymore. Junior is not coming back."</TE>
<TE>   At Sharon Smith's home, the grief is also still fresh.</TE>
<TE>   "He was my life, he was not just my son but a best friend," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and her son watched basketball games together and shopped
together.</TE>
<TE>   When they strolled in Beverly Hills, Junior admired the shoes in
Gucci. She told him she wouldn't purchase shoes that expensive for
him until his feet had stopped growing.</TE>
<TE>   He had no beef with that. She did, however, get him shirts and a
hat at Burberry's.</TE>
<TE>   Junior liked to talk about college with his mother, who -- like
his father -- emigrated from Jamaica. He liked to hear about her days
at UCLA, where she'd won a scholarship. Because she went to UCLA,
Junior also hoped to go to school there.</TE>
<TE>   Monique Smith, 23, said she hopes that in death her brother will
make the difference he planned to make in life.</TE>
<TE>   "He cared about the neighborhood," she said. "He had so many
plans. He knew what he wanted and knew what he had to do to get
there. He was so gifted."</TE>
<TE>   Junior's parents took great pains to keep their teenager safe.
Since age 11, Junior had a cellular phone and he would call his
parents, letting them know about basketball practices, games and
whenever he was heading to a friend's house.</TE>
<TE>   "We are responsible parents," Jackson said. "We did everything
possible, but still it didn't work."</TE>

<HD>Embezzler Repays Victims, Avoids Jail</HD>
<DH>Former attorney, who continues to work for South Gate,
still owes $300,000 in judgments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A disbarred attorney working at South Gate City Hall avoided a prison
term Wednesday after paying restitution to embezzlement victims, but
she still owes other creditors more than $300,000 awarded in fraud,
malpractice and other lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   A judge in downtown Los Angeles suspended a three-year prison term
for Cristeta Paguirigan after prosecutors said she complied with his
order to pay $33,900 to six victims. He also sentenced her to 45 days
of community service: picking up trash with a Caltrans crew. She
pleaded guilty in April to one count of embezzlement.</LD>
<LD>   Paguirigan, a 1984 graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law, had a history of felony convictions before she began working
last year in South Gate through the Los Angeles law firm of Albright,
Yee &amp; Schmit.</LD>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, she was convicted on two felony counts for
embezzling $37,500 from a Long Beach company. She was also convicted
of forgery, which led to her disbarment in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed before Wednesday's hearing, Paguirigan said she plans
to pay all the civil judgments against her. She is accused of
stealing clients' money, crafting fraudulent agreements, abandoning
cases and bouncing checks. One elderly woman said Paguirigan stole
her life savings after convincing her to create a joint trust
account.</TE>
<TE>   In South Gate, Paguirigan continues racking up fees of $200 an
hour as a litigation specialist for the city. Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba
has called her past lawbreaking a mistake, while she and her council
allies authorized payments of $350,000 for her work over the past 12
months, according to billing records.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan denied accusations that she has eluded creditors by
avoiding court appearances, constantly changing residences and
changing her name.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never any secret about where I am," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys disagreed. "Where is she? I've been trying
to find her for over two years," said Charles Alpert, a lawyer for a
Los Angeles woman who won a $50,000 malpractice case against
Paguirigan.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to serve her with a judgment debtor
documents," he said in an interview, "but then she hides."</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan is her maiden name, which she used throughout her
marriage, according to Stephen Martin, her ex-husband's attorney.
After Paguirigan's 1999 divorce, Martin said she changed her last
name to her ex-husband's, Klaparda.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, more than a dozen former clients, landlords and
friends have won civil judgments against her, ranging from $1,000 to
$190,000. The majority were default judgments after Paguirigan failed
to respond to the lawsuits. Some were wiped out when Paguirigan
declared bankruptcy in 2000. Others were repaid as part of the plea
agreement in the most recent embezzlement case.</TE>
<TE>   The largest known civil judgment against Paguirigan involves the
estate of Doris Margaret Loss, an elderly Pico Rivera woman who said
Paguirigan stole her life savings of $160,000. Loss died shortly
after the money disappeared, said her attorney, Eugene Gleason. The
default judgment of $197,000, which includes interest and attorney
fees, was entered in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Though the family has recovered $50,000 through a victims fund set
up by the California State Bar, Gleason said they don't have much
hope of getting the rest. The family never notified authorities, he
said, because they feared Paguirigan would flee the country.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan blamed her troubles on poor management of her legal
practice. She lost control of her finances, she said, because the
business grew too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Gleason took another view. "She is unscrupulous, reprehensible,
dishonorable to the profession," he said. "For her to prey upon
someone who was so elderly and in a hospital bed in her home ...
that's pretty low."</TE>
<TE>   Others who have won judgments against Paguirigan include a Las
Vegas landlord who said she skipped out on rent payments of $41,000,
and a West Hollywood man who said Paguirigan owes him $4,900 after
misrepresenting herself as a lawyer when she had been disbarred.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan is not licensed to practice as an attorney, but her
hourly fee of $200 tops those of many lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   City billing records show that Paguirigan appears to play a major
role in city affairs.</TE>
<TE>   She prepares agenda items, revises contracts and writes press
releases. She also has access to some personnel files and works on
investigations of city employees.</TE>

<HD>Mattel to Pay Fine for Donations</HD>
<DH>A former executive and a consultant gave the company's
money to Davis and others. Both will pay penalties, as will the El
Segundo firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and city ethics investigators announced Wednesday that a joint
probe into laundering of political contributions has resulted in more
than $454,000 in fines proposed against Mattel Inc., a former
executive at the firm and its former political consultant.</LD>
<LD>   Former Mattel executive Fermin Cuza signed a stipulation admitting
that he used $52,000 from the El Segundo-based toy maker for
political purposes. Cuza made 56 political contributions in the names
of others to 25 campaign committees in state and local races.
Consultant Alan M. Schwartz admitted that he aided and abetted Cuza
in laundering 30 of the contributions.</LD>
<LD>   Cuza and Schwartz were fined for laundering political
contributions. Mattel stipulated that it failed to properly disclose
contributions that came from its coffers.</LD>
<TE>   There was no indication in the ethics filings that any of the
candidates who received the money knew the funds were laundered.</TE>
<TE>   Committees that got the money include those for Gov. Gray Davis,
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey),
Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), County
Supervisor Don Knabe, Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco, City
Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, and former Los Angeles mayoral candidates
Xavier Becerra and Antonio Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   "The laundering of campaign contributions is one of the most
serious violations of the [Political Reform] Act, as it denies the
public of information about the true source of a candidate's
financial support," the state Fair Political Practices Commission
said in its filing.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the governor, attorney general, county
supervisor and others said those officials had no knowledge that the
contributions did not come from the source listed on the checks.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of stuff is horrible for politics," said Phil
Giarrizzo, a political consultant for Pacheco. "By the sins of
others, [Schwartz)] taints a whole lot of decent, honorable people."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he would return any city matching funds received
based on the laundered contributions, and he would ask ethics
officials if he could legally return the donations themselves to
Mattel.</TE>
<TE>   The city Ethics Commission said Cuza and Schwartz "sought to
conceal the use of Mattel funds to make political contributions under
assumed names by circumventing Mattel's internal policies and
procedures regarding the making of political contributions."</TE>
<TE>   The two also admitted that their laundered donations cumulatively
exceeded the contribution limit of $500 in City Council races and
$1,000 in mayoral contests.</TE>
<TE>   The stipulations and fine amounts have been recommended by the
staffs of the state and city agencies but still have to be approved
by the FPPC and the city commission, which are scheduled to vote on
them in the next week.</TE>
<TE>   A probe by the Federal Election Commission has been completed and
soon is expected to result in fines in the six figures.</TE>
<TE>   Mark E. Beck, an attorney for Cuza, said his client has agreed to
pay approximately $105,000 for laundering contributions to federal
candidates, including those running for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It was done in the mistaken belief that this was necessary to get
out there politically, without thinking of the consequences," Beck
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Cuza was not seeking any specific favors from the
politicians he was giving to and that there was no quid pro quo
involved.</TE>
<TE>   The $236,000 in city fines from the three parties represents the
second-largest amount in a case of its kind in the history of the Los
Angeles Ethics Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The government probe began in March 2001, when Mattel reported to
the city, state and federal agencies that Cuza, a senior vice
president, had with the assistance of Schwartz "unilaterally caused
Mattel to reimburse various individuals for their political
contributions," according to the Ethics Commission stipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased to bring this issue to a close," Mattel
spokeswoman Jules Andres said.</TE>
<TE>   "These actions were taken in direct violation of Mattel policy.
When we learned of the wrongdoing, we immediately investigated and
self-disclosed the situation to the appropriate authorities and have
since cooperated fully with them," Andres added</TE>
<TE>   Contributions financed with Mattel funds included a $1,000
contribution attributed to Schwartz and given to the Davis campaign
for governor in 1997, almost a year before he was elected.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single contribution was $5,000, given in 1999 to a
committee for Larry Guidi, a candidate for mayor of Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Nine contributions totaling $4,250 went to Pacheco in 1999 when he
was running for City Council, and 11 totaling $10,000 went to the
mayoral campaign of Becerra.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz agreed to pay $66,000 in fines to the city Ethics
Commission after admitting to 66 counts of violating ethics rules.</TE>
<TE>   Cuza agreed to pay $110,000 and Mattel will pay $60,000 to the
city agency. The three parties agreed to pay $218,000 in fines to the
state Fair Political Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Russo, chief of enforcement for the FPPC, issued a statement
crediting Mattel for bringing the violations to the attention of
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment on the merits of the case, as did Ethics
Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham.</TE>

<HD>Two Arrested in Donation Scam Aimed at Elderly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westminster police are warning the public in the wake of several
scams in which elderly people have been duped into handing over
money.</LD>
<LD>   In the most recent case, a 74-year-old man came close to giving
suspects $20,000, thinking he was helping them donate to a church. A
bank teller became suspicious and called police when the man tried to
withdraw the money.</LD>
<LD>   Westminster police arrested Bopha Eng Touch, 22, and Hung Phi
Nguyen, 26, both of Los Angeles. They are being held at Orange County
Jail on suspicion of conspiracy, attempted grand theft and attempted
theft from an elder.</LD>
<TE>   Westminster Police Sgt. Tom Pixler said the scam typically
involves a woman -- who says she wants to donate her money to a
religious organization because she is leaving the country -- and an
accomplice.</TE>
<TE>   The woman tells victims they can have a portion of the "donation."
But the woman tells the victims they must produce a certain amount of
cash to prove they can be trusted to make the donation. The woman and
her accomplice then switch the victim's money with a bag of shredded
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Pixler said that in such cases, victims might not report the scam.</TE>
<TE>   "When elderly people are victims of crimes, they're ashamed and
don't report it," Pixler said. "We're hoping that other victims will
come forward."</TE>
<TE>   At least two people have lost money this year, Pixler said.</TE>

<HD>Airport Passenger Cap May Increase</HD>
<DH>County, Newport will consider raising John Wayne's annual
limit to 10.3 million next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan that would increase the number of passengers using John Wayne
Airport and add two gates will be considered next week by the Board
of Supervisors and Newport Beach City Council, officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A court settlement restricts the number of passengers at the
airport to 8.4 million a year, but that cap was set to increase to
9.8 million Jan. 1. Under the proposed plan, the capacity would
increase to 10.3 million passengers next year and 10.8 million
passengers by 2011.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which expires in 2005, ended a lawsuit brought by
Newport Beach and others over noise complaints. The new proposal
would extend the terms of the settlement to 2015.</LD>
<TE>   Newport Beach Councilman Gary Proctor said Wednesday that
officials hope the plan will satisfy the federal government and
airlines while preserving the quality of life for residents who live
near the airport. "This takes us out of harm's way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA and a group of airlines have expressed preliminary support
for the plan but have yet to formally adopt it, he said. Proctor
hopes they will sign off on it by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The future of John Wayne Airport has been a hot topic since voters
rejected plans to build a commercial airport at El Toro. Airlines
have long called for more flights at John Wayne, a move opposed by
local residents.</TE>

<HD>Deliberations Begin in Beating Case</HD>
<DH>Jurors must decide whether Westlake Village man brutally
attacked his ex-wife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An accountant and suburban housewife, Linda Morrisset outwardly
seemed an unlikely target for the savage attack that nearly ended her
life three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Yet someone entered her Camarillo home through a sliding glass
door on a cool September night and beat her over the head with a
heavy metal flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from a few necklaces, nothing was missing from the home.</LD>
<TE>   As Morrisset languished in a coma for 16 days, police interrogated
her ex-husband, Westlake Village businessman Lee Mannheimer, who had
also been a suspect in an alleged 1993 murder-for-hire plot against
Morrisset.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges were filed in either case.</TE>
<TE>   But now a Ventura County civil jury is being asked to decide
whether Mannheimer brutally attacked his ex-wife after becoming
enraged over a child custody mix-up.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which began deliberations Wednesday, will either hold
Mannheimer responsible and put a financial price on his actions, or
decide that Morrisset is so mentally limited by her injuries that she
cannot recall the night of the attack or is lying about it.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, 51, sued Mannheimer, 59, two years ago for assault and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. She is seeking more
than $2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict. If they find
Mannheimer maliciously beat his ex-wife, the case will advance to a
second stage to determine an amount for punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else did this," attorney Allen Ball, who represents
Morrisset, told jurors during closing arguments Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Holding an enlarged photograph of his client's crushed skull, Ball
told jurors Mannheimer entered Morrisset's house and bashed her over
the head.</TE>
<TE>   As she crawled, the attack continued as Mannheimer missed his
target and slammed the flashlight into the floor, Ball said. He said
detectives identified four dents consistent with such blows.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not done by a burglar," Ball said. "That is done by
someone with malice, ill will and intent. And the only reason someone
broke into that house is to do this."</TE>
<TE>   But Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez, told jurors there is no
physical evidence linking his client to the bloody crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that Mannheimer had an alibi for the time of the
assault, and called the plaintiff's theory of intent weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Mannheimer did not have any motive to hurt his ex-wife in
1999," Ramirez argued, noting the couple had been divorced for six
years.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer cited testimony from his client and Mannheimer's
12-year-old son, Maxx, who told jurors there was no custody mix-up
the night of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Morrisset doesn't have a perfect memory of that evening,"
Ramirez said. "She couldn't be expected to with the injuries she
sustained."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the three-week trial, Morrisset recounted a marriage
that was rocky from the start and led to divorce in 1993. They shared
custody of their only child, Maxx, and followed a firm schedule of
custody exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, 1999, Morrisset went to her ex-husband's house in
Westlake Village to pick up the boy, she told jurors. About an hour
later, she said, Mannheimer entered her house and bludgeoned her.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "He bashed my head in," Morrisset testified, sitting before jurors
in a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset told a nurse the same story when she awoke from a coma
in the intensive care unit of St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But a homicide investigator with the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department said Morrisset had given several inconsistent statements
about the attack, including whether she saw her son and ex-husband
that day and what her assailant was wearing.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Tim Lorenzen further acknowledged that a search of
Mannheimer's home failed to turn up evidence. Mannheimer was arrested
on suspicion of attempted murder, but released four days later.</TE>
<TE>   Adamant in his denial of wrongdoing, Mannheimer sued Morrisset for
slander, but the case was recently dropped.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand, Mannheimer denied beating his ex-wife and
told jurors he was home asleep when the near-fatal assault occurred.
A German au pair living with him at the time confirmed his account.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer told jurors he had no motive to harm Morrisset.</TE>
<TE>   But Morrisset's lawyer tried to show that Mannheimer was so
possessive of his son that he angrily lashed out at the boy's mother.
Ball also presented evidence of the alleged 1993 murder conspiracy to
prove his motive theory.</TE>
<TE>   A business associate of Mannheimer's was arrested after telling
law enforcement officers Mannheimer wanted his then-wife "to
disappear." Mannheimer was never arrested, and the associate was not
charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the couple sat a few feet apart as their lawyers
summed up the case.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer, dressed in a tweed jacket and sitting cross-legged at
counsel table, shook his head in disagreement as Ball spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, wearing a pale pink sweater, nodded in agreement and
smiled at jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Brain-damaged and partially paralyzed, Morrisset can no longer
work as an accountant. Her lost earnings are estimated at $1.5
million, her medical bills have cost $273,000, and her anticipated
rehabilitation costs top $365,000, according to her attorney.</TE>
<TE>   She wants Mannheimer to pay those costs, in addition to damages
for her pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The Superior Court jury of four women and eight men began
deliberations late Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Calls for Better Teamwork</HD>
<DH>Mayor issues executive order instructing municipal leaders
to be more responsive to neighborhood concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Wednesday issued an executive
order that directs city general managers, department heads and
commissioners to implement a new plan to make government more
responsive to neighborhood needs.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, called "TeamWork LA," is part of Hahn's broader
plan to bring government to every neighborhood through the creation
of seven geographically based service areas and of cabinets made up
of city representatives who would coordinate services.</LD>
<LD>   "TeamWork L.A." directs municipal leaders to implement three
components: serving on the neighborhood service cabinets as core and
associate members, identifying assistant managers to participate in
neighborhood service cabinet meetings, and redrawing service delivery
districts to conform with the boundaries of the area planning
districts.</LD>
<TE>   "We are changing the way that the city government does business,"
Hahn said in a prepared statement. "Los Angeles is a city of
neighborhoods and our task as city government is finding ways to
deliver the services our neighborhoods deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Through community-based government, Hahn added, neighborhood
priorities will drive city government priorities. "Los Angeles
residents will see action on the neighborhood issues and problems
they care about the most," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn had announced his proposal shortly after voters rejected the
San Fernando Valley secession measure on Nov. 5.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Latinos, Whites See the Economy, Future Differently</HD>
<DH>The annual UC Irvine survey also shows that despite worries
about overdevelopment, money and crime, most people are happy here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latinos and whites in Orange County have strikingly different views
about the economy and their prospects for the future, according to a
poll released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The findings in UC Irvine's latest annual Orange County Survey
found that Latinos consider the faltering economy and crime to be
among the biggest problems they face; whites pointed to the county's
exploding growth, traffic and transportation problems.</LD>
<LD>   The survey also showed a growing countywide concern about the
health of the local economy, with nearly a third of those polled
saying their financial situations worsened over the past year.</LD>
<TE>   A majority said they supported the voter-approved initiative to
turn the closed El Toro Marine Air Station into a Great Park instead
of an international airport, but more than half also said they would
rarely -- if ever -- use the park.</TE>
<TE>   Survey director Mark Baldassare said the gap between Latinos and
whites in Orange County is strongly influenced by differences in
income and education. With Latinos now accounting for nearly a third
of the county's 2.9 million residents, those differences are
reshaping the area's once monolithic social and political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos clearly remain behind in terms of economic progress but
[are] optimistic that, as individuals and as a group, they are going
to catch up in the years ahead," Baldassare said. "Whether or not
that happens will be extraordinarily important not only for Latinos
but for the entire county, economically and otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The telephone survey of 2,007 Orange County adults was conducted
by UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology and the Public Policy
Institute of California, a private nonprofit organization that
conducts public policy research on economic, social and political
issues in the state. The study was sponsored in part by the Los
Angeles Times. The poll questioned a random sampling of county
residents from Nov. 6 to Nov. 14. Of the people included in the poll,
1,255 identified themselves as white, 475 as Latino, 133 as Asian and
26 as black. The remainder included people of other races or
ethnicities, plus those who declined to answer.</TE>
<TE>   The interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The poll's
margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Baldassare said answers by Asians and whites were nearly
identical. But the poll found Latinos and whites had vastly different
opinions about public policy issues, including the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Latinos were twice as likely as whites to be concerned that they
or someone in their family would lose a job over the next year, and
23% of Latinos said they don't have enough family income to pay their
bills--compared with 10% of whites.</TE>
<TE>   * Latinos tend to be more hopeful than whites about the future. Of
those questioned, 43% said they believe Orange County will be a
better place to live in during the years ahead compared with 29% of
the whites.</TE>
<TE>   * When asked to name the county's top transportation priorities,
42% of whites said freeways and highways and 25% listed a light-rail
system. Among Latinos, 27% named freeways and highways, 22% said the
public bus system and 22% picked local streets and roads.</TE>
<TE>   * On the issue of the county's infrastructure needs, 57% of
Latinos said schools should be the top priority, compared with 41% of
whites.</TE>
<TE>   Newly elected Anaheim Councilman Richard Chavez said he was not
surprised by the disparity in views.</TE>
<TE>   "A large percentage of Latinos who live in Orange County are
immigrants and have a tendency to have lower-paying jobs and live in
more crowded conditions," Chavez said. "What I'm touched by is the
optimism. I think that reflects very highly on Latinos."</TE>
<TE>   Araceli Solorzano, a 23-year-old single mother from Stanton,
concurred with many of the views expressed by those surveyed,
although she did not participate in the poll. She said her biggest
concern is crime, even though she lives in a good neighborhood, and
by the cost of living.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been rough. Everything is so much more expensive. If I
wanted to buy a house right now, there's no way I could afford it,"
Solorzano said. "But I wouldn't say things are that bad. At least I
have a roof over my head and a car to get to work."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the negatives, the majority of Orange County residents
surveyed said they were happy with their quality of life--giving the
area higher ranking than people living in Los Angeles and San
Francisco have done in similar polls. Nearly 89% of the Orange County
residents polled said things were going very well or somewhat well.
Only 75% of those living in the San Francisco Bay Area and 80% in Los
Angeles felt the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, people in Orange County are pretty grateful,"
Baldassare said. "Relative to the rest of the state, quality-of-life
ratings in Orange County are very strong."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy surrounding the fate of the El Toro Marine base --
the county's most divisive political issue the past few years -- has
"dropped off the radar" of most residents since the passage of
Measure A in March, Baldassare said. Voters decided the best option
for the base was a Great Park and, in effect, scuttled the proposed
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Irvine survey found that 65% of county residents favored
the Great Park plan, although only 49% said local tax dollars should
fund it.</TE>
<TE>   And not too many residents said they would actually get much use
out of the park. Only 13% of those surveyed said they would use the
park's recreational facilities "often." Just under 40% predicted
they'd never use the park, and 14% said they would "rarely" visit.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who led the campaign in favor of the
Great Park, discounted those findings. No tax dollars will be needed,
he said, because of plans to raise funds by selling some land for
development.</TE>
<TE>   Most people in the county also don't realize the proposal includes
hiking and riding trails, more than 50 athletic fields, educational
centers and other major recreational facilities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Great metropolitan parks are a lot different than neighborhood
parks," Agran said. "We're talking about something comparable to, but
even larger than, San Diego's Balboa Park or San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park. Millions of people will use it."</TE>

<HD>Toxin Detected in Simi Ground Water</HD>
<DH>State officials aren't sure where the perchlorate came
from, but nearby Rocketdyne lab has the same contamination. Drinking
supplies safe.</DH>

<LD>State investigators have found a highly toxic chemical used in rocket
fuel in 18 water wells in Simi Valley, but the contamination has not
been traced to the nearby Rocketdyne testing site.</LD>
<LD>   The chemical perchlorate, which has been linked to thyroid
problems, has also been found in wells at the Santa Susana Field Lab,
but there is no evidence that contamination in the city migrated from
there, according to a new report by the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control.</LD>
<LD>   Drinking water supplies are not contaminated or threatened,
officials said, because most of Simi Valley's tap water is imported
from Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   With the latest findings, perchlorate has now been detected in
ground water at three locations on the Rocketdyne site, and in lower
concentrations in wells to the north, south and east of the hilltop
lab.</TE>
<TE>   The highest state reading was 19.2 parts per billion -- nearly
five times the allowable limit of 4 ppb -- at a monitoring well at a
gas station in Simi Valley. The readings were taken earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   State investigators could not determine the chemical's source, but
they noted that Rocketdyne is the nearest known location with
perchlorate contamination. Solid rocket fuel "is the main source of
perchlorate contamination found in ground water" across the nation,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials said there is no proof the chemical comes
from the lab, noting that perchlorate has not been detected in
springs in the undeveloped area around the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The data from the state is very compelling and shows it's not
coming from Rocketdyne," said Art Lenox, an environmental scientist
at the lab. "But activists continue to want to use the data to point
fingers at Rocketdyne."</TE>
<TE>   The company has tested wells of various depths around the lab's
perimeter, and no seepage was detected, Lenox said.</TE>
<TE>   The perchlorate discovered in Simi Valley more likely came from
firecrackers, fertilizer or road flares, all of which contain the
chemical in concentrations high enough to trigger the findings, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The geology of the field lab, with its bedrock faults and
sandstone, would absorb contaminants and minimize migration, Lenox
said. What's more, he said, a large part of the work conducted at
Santa Susana involved kerosene or liquid oxygen, not heavy rocket
fuel containing perchlorate.</TE>
<TE>   The closest structure on the lab site is about a mile south of
Simi Valley city limits and about 1 1/2 miles from the nearest
housing subdivision. Several contaminated wells are within 2 1/2
miles of the closest building at the rocket-testing site.</TE>
<TE>   From January to August, state officials took water or soil samples
from 76 wells -- 68 shallow and eight deep -- 25 springs and 30
drainage ditches between Rocketdyne and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The state detected perchlorate in ground water less than 20 feet
below the surface in wells north of the field lab. Perchlorate also
was found this year south of the lab, near the proposed Ahmanson
Ranch housing development, and it was detected in a well east of the
site last year.</TE>
<TE>   Activists said they are concerned not only about perchlorate but
other chemicals that may be migrating behind it. Perchlorate tends to
lead contaminant plumes.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a large amount of perchlorate usage [at the lab], with
heavy contamination," said environmental activist Dan Hirsch. "It's
the only known perchlorate source nearby. Where else could the stuff
have been coming from?"</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said that although the
findings pose no immediate health concern, residents and city
officials want to know the source of the toxic chemical.</TE>
<TE>   "If these results don't give us any definitive answers, then we'll
continue to work with the state about doing further analysis to get
an answer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials will discuss their findings during a meeting
Wednesday in Simi Valley sponsored by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency. It will be held from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the
Grand Vista Hotel, 999 Enchanted Way.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne, a division of Boeing, conducted nuclear energy
research at the lab for decades until chemical and nuclear
contamination was found in 1989. The lab is now undergoing a
federally funded $186-million cleanup, but rocket testing continues
at the site.</TE>

<HD>Court Affirms Pledge Ruling</HD>
<DH>Appeals panel rebuffs attempts to nullify its decision
outlawing the phrase 'under God.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court unanimously rejected an effort aimed at
scuttling its decision that the Pledge of Allegiance is
unconstitutional when recited in classrooms, ruling Wednesday that
the Sacramento father who filed the controversial lawsuit on behalf
of his daughter has legal standing to proceed in court.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate 3-0 ruling, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
rebuffed an attempt by the U.S. Senate to formally intervene in the
case, but the court said it would be happy to consider a
friend-of-the-court brief from the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The court's ruling in June that the pledge violates the
Constitution's prohibition against the establishment of religion is
on hold as appeals play out. That decision struck down a 1954 law
that added the words "under God" to the pledge.</LD>
<TE>   The court's action precipitated harsh criticism from President
Bush, Gov. Gray Davis and the Senate, which condemned it in a 99-0
vote.</TE>
<TE>   In its 3-0 ruling Wednesday, the San Francisco-based court
rejected an appeal from the girl's mother, Sandra Banning, who
contended that the girl's father, Michael Newdow, an avowed atheist,
could not challenge the pledge on behalf of the third-grader because
he did not have custody of her.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the court ordered Newdow to respond by Dec. 24 to the
Elk Grove School District's request that the full appeals court
rehear the controversial June decision.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wednesday's rulings were procedural in nature, Judge
Alfred T. Goodwin, an appointee of President Nixon, and Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, an appointee of President Carter who joined Goodwin in the
2-1 June ruling, used language that showed no sign that the judges
were trimming their sails.</TE>
<TE>   "When schoolteachers lead a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance
according to school district policy, they present a message by the
state endorsing not just religion generally, but a monotheistic
religion organized 'under God,' " Goodwin wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "While Newdow cannot expect the entire community surrounding his
daughter to participate in, let alone agree with, his choice of
atheism and his daughter's exposure to his views, he can expect to be
free from the government's endorsing a particular view of religion
and unconstitutionally indoctrinating his impressionable young
daughter on a daily basis in that official view."</TE>
<TE>   "The pledge to a nation 'under God,' with its imprimatur of
governmental sanction," Goodwin added, "provides the message to
Newdow's young daughter not only that non-believers, or believers in
non-Judeo-Christian religions, are outsiders, but more specifically
that her father's beliefs are those of an outsider, and necessarily
inferior to what she is exposed to in the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Such strong language makes it highly unlikely that the three-judge
panel will agree to rehear the case, setting in motion a vote by the
24-judge court on whether the case should be reheard by an en banc,
11-judge panel. It takes a vote of 13 of the judges for the court to
grant such a hearing, and a decision is not expected before February.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Ferdinand P. Fernandez, who wrote a stinging dissent to the
June ruling, issued a brief concurring opinion Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez emphasized that he agreed only on the fact that Newdow
had standing to continue the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the order's allusions to the merits of the controversy,
we decide nothing but the narrow standing issue," Fernandez, an
appointee of former President Bush, wrote. In June, he wrote that the
Constitution was "not designed to drive religious expression out of
public thought."</TE>
<TE>   A firestorm of criticism erupted within hours of that ruling and
soon thereafter author Goodwin stayed it pending further proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Both USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, a
liberal, and UCLA constitutional law professor Eugene Volokh, a
conservative, said they thought Goodwin's language Wednesday was
noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was struck by the majority remaining quite unrepentant on the
merits," Volokh said. "It is an interesting indication that they were
not at all persuaded by the firestorm of opposition to the decision."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Goodwin would have written this in the normal
case," Chemerinsky said. "He wrote to signal that he believes the
court was right."</TE>
<TE>   A clearly pleased Newdow, 49, said, "Judge Goodwin writes
beautifully and I concur wholeheartedly in his views. This is not an
issue of what is a correct religion, but whether government should be
involved in this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Parrish, the attorney representing Banning, the
schoolgirl's mother, said she was not displeased with the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "All she wanted was to make sure that the child was not a party to
the case and the court recognized that when it said Newdow is no
longer claiming to represent the child. In that respect, Sandra
Banning has accomplished what she wanted, which is to get her child
out of the case," Parrish said.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit cited decisions from a federal appeals court in
Chicago and two California appellate decisions in ruling that Newdow
has standing to pursue the case even though Banning has sole legal
custody.</TE>
<TE>   A state court custody order provides that Newdow retains various
parental rights, including the right to inspect his daughter's school
and medical records.</TE>
<TE>   "California state courts have recognized that noncustodial parents
maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their
individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict
those of the custodial parent or offend her," Goodwin wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez wrote the other decision, rejecting the Senate's request
to formally intervene in the case. The Justice Department already has
intervened and has submitted a brief, along with the Elk Grove
Unified School District, asking that the full court rehear the case.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, citing legal precedent, said the Senate had not shown
that it has "suffered an 'injury in fact' -- an invasion of a legally
protected interest which is ... concrete and particularized" -- the
prerequisite to gain standing as an intervenor.</TE>
<TE>   "A public law, after enactment, is not the Senate's any more than
it is the law of any other citizen or group of citizens in the United
States. It is a law of the United States of America, and the
government is already represented in this by the attorney general."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia M. Bryan, a lawyer for the Senate, said, "We obviously
disagree with the court's decision." But she added that she was
pleased that the 9th Circuit "made it clear" that it was willing to
hear the Senate's views in a friend-of-the court brief.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit, without explanation, also rebuffed California's
attempt to formally intervene in the case in support of the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Davis expressed dismay.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Supreme Court can begin each day invoking God's blessing,
then surely America's schoolchildren can start with the Pledge of
Allegiance," he said. "The court got the first decision wrong. They
should not compound that error by silencing California's voice."</TE>
<TE>   John C. Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman
University School of Law in Orange, said he was disturbed that the
9th Circuit had agreed to accept a friend-of-the court brief only
from the Senate and had rejected requests to file such briefs from a
dozen groups, including the American Legion, the Christian Legal
Society and Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne.</TE>

<HD>Killer's Jury Deadlocks on Death</HD>
<DH>Triple murderer Trinh has sought execution for his 1999
Anaheim rampage. The D.A. must now decide whether to convene a third
panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second jury has deadlocked on whether a man convicted of murdering
three hospital employees in a 1999 Anaheim shooting rampage should be
put to death.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for a week before voting 11 to 1 Wednesday in
favor of the death penalty for Dung D. Trinh, who has dared jurors to
give him the death penalty for his actions. Orange County Superior
Court Judge John Ryan declared a mistrial in the penalty phase of the
case.</LD>
<LD>   In September, the first jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of life
in prison without parole, with many jurors concluding Trinh did not
deserve death because he was emotionally distraught.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome leaves Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas with the choice of
trying a third time to win a death sentence or agreeing to impose
life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting rampage prompted Rackauckas three years ago to
declare that his office would seek the death penalty in all cases
that involve random, multiple killings.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas on Wednesday declined to reveal his next move, but he
reaffirmed his view that execution is an appropriate punishment for
mass killings. He also said there was no reason to review his
office's policy on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the nature of the case ... the random shooting of
people who were vulnerable and in a hospital, I believe the death
penalty is the right punishment here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thought about this a lot since it happened, and I still feel
strongly that it's the right policy."</TE>
<TE>   The killings occurred Sept. 14, 1999, when Trinh armed himself
with a pair of revolvers and walked into West Anaheim Medical Center
seeking vengeance for the death of his mother hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh, 46, was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder
and one count of attempted murder after just three hours of
deliberations. The defendant, who blamed the hospital for his
mother's death, took the stand during the first penalty phase and
pleaded for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare all of you to send me to death," said the heavily tattooed
Trinh. "I deserve it. I not only deserve it, I need it. I want it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Trinh's urging, jurors have found it difficult to agree on
an appropriate punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a defendant says, 'Put me to death' doesn't
necessarily cause jurors to want to do it," Rackauckas said. "Jurors
consider death very seriously, and they need to be very strongly
convinced."</TE>
<TE>   Trinh, who was videotaped as he calmly fired and reloaded,
believed his 72-year-old mother died because workers at the hospital
had botched her care. Defense lawyers did not deny that Trinh killed
hospital maintenance director Ronald Robertson, 50, nurse's aide
Marlene Mustaffa, 60, and pharmacist Vincent Rosetti, 50.</TE>
<TE>   But they argued that the shooter was suffering emotional and
physical breakdowns at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's mother died at another hospital on the morning of the
shootings but had had her hip replaced at West Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, the Orange County district attorney's office has
prosecuted 340 murder cases with "special circumstances," under which
death is a potential penalty. The office has sought the death penalty
in 90 of those cases, or 26%.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 49 convicted killers face the death penalty in Orange
County, and all of those cases are in various stages of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas must decide by Dec. 19 whether to continue seeking the
death penalty.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS CIVIC CENTER</KH>
<HD>Odd Sculpture Stands Above Public Opinion</HD>
<DH>The colored crystal and concrete Triforium was erected in
1975.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a quarter-century, Los Angeles' most controversial
public artwork still provokes arguments between those who contend
that it's outstanding -- and those who complain that it's still
standing</LD>
<LD>   Love it or hate it, the Triforium in the downtown Civic Center has
never stopped polarizing people.</LD>
<LD>   At six stories and 60 tons, the three-pronged concrete and crystal
tower at Temple and Main streets is hard to miss. Especially on those
rare occasions when its 1,494 light bulbs hidden behind colorful
Italian glass prisms are pulsating to music piped from loudspeakers
that are part of it.</LD>
<TE>   The $925,000 sculpture was completed in December 1975. City
officials commissioned it to be the sparkling centerpiece of the
$30-million Los Angeles Mall, a subterranean shopping plaza tucked
between municipal and federal buildings.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the Triforium was more lightning rod than crown
jewel.</TE>
<TE>   Critics -- many of them across the street in City Hall -- derided
the sculpture as "the Psychedelic Nickelodeon," "the Trifoolery" and
"Three Wishbones in Search of a Turkey"</TE>
<TE>   There were problems with its sound, its lights and its setting.</TE>
<TE>   An electrical short delayed the music system's debut during
dedication ceremonies. When the pod-shaped speakers finally came to
life, spectators said the sound of the Finkenbeiner glass-bell
carillon was fuzzy.</TE>
<TE>   The computer that synchronized the lights to the music had to be
reprogrammed.</TE>
<TE>   The reflecting pond beneath the tower had to be drained and then
lined with $18,000 worth of tile to prevent water from leaking into
the shopping mall below.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to artist Joseph Young to defend his work from those
who dubbed the Triforium "the Kitsch-22 of Kinetic Sculpture" and
"Joe's L.A. Space Launch."</TE>
<TE>   Young blamed the Triforium's initial problems on tampering by city
workers. His musical sculpture, he told everyone who would listen,
eventually would come to be known as "the Rosetta Stone of art and
technology" and the world's first permanent "poly-phonoptic" tower.</TE>
<TE>   The Triforium has outlived many of its critics. So has Young, who
at 83 is as passionate as ever about his sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "At times it was very lonely," he says now of the harsh criticism
he and the Triforium were subjected to. "When you do something that
affects public tastes, you have to be armed to face the extremes of
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The Triforium, he said, was designed to depict the unfinished,
kaleidoscopic nature of Los Angeles and to be a friendly meeting
place for its people.</TE>
<TE>   Young, of West Hollywood, inspected the Triforium last weekend
while on a visit to nearby Parker Center. He went to the police
headquarters to see if one of his murals, which graces its lobby, is
in movable condition now that the building may be demolished. The
mural is in relatively good shape, he found.</TE>
<TE>   So is the Triforium -- even though its lights and sound system
were not in use during his weekend visit. Young rated the sculpture's
condition as "seven on a scale of 10."</TE>
<TE>   But, "that seven is enormous," he said, given the lack of
attention to the work over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn broke out in a grin this week when he was
asked what he thought of the Triforium.</TE>
<TE>   "What's your next question?" he laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what should be done with the Triforium, he replied: "Was
anyone planning to do anything with it?"</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn then quickly recited facts about its Italian glass and
"the great L.A. artist Joe Young" and told of a group of Russian
tourists who stopped him in City Hall and asked directions to the
Triforium.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see it used more," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   That could happen soon.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Gomez, the Cultural Affairs Department's new manager of its
public art and mural collection, said the Triforium is scheduled to
undergo a formal appraisal in April that will determine its condition
and any repairs it needs to produce sound and music.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it looks very interesting. I look forward to seeing it in
action," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Joi Oubre, manager of Civic Center facilities for the city General
Services Department, suggested that putting the Triforium to work
might be as simple as flipping a few switches.</TE>
<TE>   "It lights up. There may be some bulbs missing, but it works,
we've tested it," Oubre said. "The chimes sound the time. The problem
is with the music. About four or five years ago, one of the judges at
the courthouse across the street got upset and wrote a nasty letter
to our general manager at the time saying it was too noisy. That's
why we stopped playing music."</TE>
<TE>   Restoration of the music and light shows would be an improvement,
according to those in the local art and preservation community who
say they have come to appreciate the Triforium. The area in Fletcher
Bowron Square around the sculpture needs a little work, too, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little spiffing up would hugely help," said Amy Inouye, a
Koreatown graphic artist who describes the Triforium as "the most
underappreciated municipal monument we've got." Part of its charm is
its "very underdog" reputation, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrific because it's pure L.A.," said Robert W. Winter, a
retired Occidental College history professor and co-author of "Los
Angeles, An Architectural Guide."</TE>
<TE>   "It says everything about L.A.," said photographer Gary Leonard,
whose Echo Park frontyard sculpture attracted wide attention in the
1990s. The Triforium is flashy "and it's never worked," he joked.
"We've thought about starting a Save-the-Triforium movement."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas K. Nagano would sign up for such a campaign. The Little
Tokyo-based writer has explored the Triforium's three-legged civic
symbolism as a depiction of "the administrative, legislative and
judicial branches of government" in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, putting sight and sound back into the Triforium
might dislodge the pigeons that now nest in its three branches,
Nagano said. The bird droppings that rain down on those walking
beneath it now represent to some the behavior by government as well,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Better signage might help, too.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita telecommunications engineer Joseph Schwartz looked
puzzled Tuesday as he studied the sculpture during a break from jury
duty in the Federal Courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The plaza around the sculpture was mostly empty, except for a
dozing transient, office workers eating lunch and several men testing
a radio-controlled toy car. Signs reading "Los Angeles Mall" didn't
explain what Schwartz was looking at.</TE>
<TE>   Told that the tower once flashed colored lights to tunes ranging
from Beethoven to the Bee Gees, Schwartz nodded: "It's a postmodern
Wurlitzer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe that's a perfect monument to an area marked by
architecture that ranges from Art Deco elegance to nondescript
modernism to glitz.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing seems to fit in with anything else around here," Schwartz
laughed.</TE>

<HD>Shooting Leaves 1 Dead, 1 Hurt</HD>
<DH>Woman is wounded at workplace, allegedly by her husband,
and a male co-worker dies. Killer flees in pickup.</DH>

<AU>Hector Becerra</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who may have been motivated by jealousy opened fire Wednesday
in a Los Angeles garment business, wounding his wife and killing one
of her male co-workers as they sewed, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Jesus Rivas, 38, then ran from the building and fled in a red
Toyota pickup, authorities said. He remained at large Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Rivas took a freight elevator to the sixth-floor
business at 8th and San Julian streets about 4 p.m., approached the
man and shot him in the head.</LD>
<TE>   Rivas then walked across the office and shot his wife in the lower
torso, police said, before dropping his gun and fleeing down the
stairs.</TE>
<TE>   One of about 20 employees on the floor, most of them women, said
she saw the killer shoot the man.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't wait. I just ran out as fast as I could down the
stairs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The male victim, who has not been identified, died at County-USC
Medical Center an hour later. The woman was in stable condition, and
her wounds were not life-threatening, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Officer Lucy Diaz said homicide detectives are
investigating the possibility that Rivas' wife and her co-worker were
having a relationship and that Rivas was jealous.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the license plate number of the pickup in which the
killer fled is 4S28983.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Perez Prado, 52, who was on the first floor when the
shooting occurred, said: "It was loud. I thought some wooden pallets
fell. I never imagined someone was being shot up there."</TE>

<LD>In the wake of recent rainstorms that dropped more than 6 inches in
some areas, the Ventura County Fire Department on Wednesday
officially closed its fire season.</LD>
<LD>   The fire season, which began a month early this year in mid-April
after a winter of scant rain, was relatively mild.</LD>
<LD>   The largest blaze, officials said, was a 150-acre fire Sept. 9 in
a Fillmore river bottom.</LD>
<TE>   The end of fire season means far fewer firefighters are
immediately dispatched to brush and grass fires, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Jury Begins Deliberations in Woman's Near-Fatal Beating</HD>
<DH>Panel must decide whether Westlake Village businessman
entered his former wife's Camarillo home and attacked her.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An accountant and suburban housewife, Linda Morrisset seemed an
unlikely target for the savage attack that nearly ended her life
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Yet someone entered her Camarillo home through a sliding glass
door on a cool September night and beat her over the head with a
heavy metal flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from a few necklaces, nothing was missing from the home.</LD>
<TE>   As Morrisset languished in a coma for 16 days, police interrogated
her ex-husband, Westlake Village businessman Lee Mannheimer, who had
also been a suspect in an alleged 1993 murder-for-hire plot against
Morrisset.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges were filed in either case.</TE>
<TE>   But now a Ventura County civil jury is being asked to decide
whether Mannheimer brutally attacked his ex-wife after becoming
enraged over a child custody mix-up.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which began deliberations Wednesday, will either hold
Mannheimer responsible and put a financial price on his actions, or
decide that Morrisset is so mentally limited by her injuries that she
cannot recall the night of the attack or is lying about it.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, 51, sued Mannheimer, 59, two years ago for assault and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. She is seeking more
than $2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict. If they find
Mannheimer maliciously beat his ex-wife, the case will advance to a
second stage to determine an amount for punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else did this," attorney Allen Ball, who represents
Morrisset, told jurors during closing arguments Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Holding an enlarged photograph of his client's crushed skull, Ball
told jurors Mannheimer entered Morrisset's house and bashed her over
the head.</TE>
<TE>   As she crawled, the attack continued as Mannheimer missed his
target and slammed the flashlight into the floor, Ball said. He said
detectives identified four dents consistent with such blows.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not done by a burglar," Ball said. "That is done by
someone with malice, ill will and intent. And the only reason someone
broke into that house is to do this."</TE>
<TE>   But Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez, told jurors there is no
physical evidence linking his client to the bloody crime scene. He
argued that Mannheimer had an alibi for the time of the assault, and
called the plaintiff's theory of intent weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Mannheimer did not have any motive to hurt his ex-wife in
1999," Ramirez argued, noting that the couple had been divorced for
six years.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer cited testimony from his client and Mannheimer's
12-year-old son, Maxx, who told jurors there was no custody mix-up
the night of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Morrisset doesn't have a perfect memory of that evening,"
Ramirez said. "She couldn't be expected to with the injuries she
sustained."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the three-week trial, Morrisset recounted a marriage
that was rocky from the start and led to divorce in 1993. They shared
custody of their only child, Maxx, and followed a firm schedule of
custody exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, 1999, Morrisset went to her ex-husband's house in
Westlake Village to pick up the boy, she told jurors. About an hour
later, she said, Mannheimer entered her house and bludgeoned her.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "He bashed my head in," Morrisset testified, sitting before jurors
in a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset told a nurse the same story when she awoke from a coma
in the intensive care unit of St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But an investigator with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department
said Morrisset had given several inconsistent statements about the
attack, including whether she saw her son and ex-husband that day and
what her assailant was wearing.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Tim Lorenzen further acknowledged that a search of
Mannheimer's home failed to turn up evidence. Mannheimer was arrested
on suspicion of attempted murder, but released four days later.</TE>
<TE>   Adamant in his denial of wrongdoing, Mannheimer sued Morrisset for
slander, but the case was recently dropped.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand, Mannheimer denied beating his ex-wife and
told jurors he was home asleep when the near-fatal assault occurred.
A German au pair living with him at the time confirmed his account.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer told jurors he had no motive to harm Morrisset.</TE>
<TE>   But Morrisset's lawyer tried to show that Mannheimer was so
possessive of his son that he angrily lashed out at the boy's mother.
Ball also presented evidence of the alleged 1993 murder conspiracy to
prove his motive theory.</TE>
<TE>   A business associate of Mannheimer's was arrested after telling
law enforcement officers Mannheimer wanted his then-wife "to
disappear." Mannheimer was never arrested, and the associate was not
charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the couple sat a few feet apart as their lawyers
summed up the case.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer, dressed in a tweed jacket and sitting cross-legged at
counsel table, shook his head in disagreement as Ball spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, wearing a pale pink sweater, nodded in agreement and
smiled at jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Brain-damaged and partially paralyzed, Morrisset can no longer
work as an accountant. Her lost earnings are estimated at $1.5
million, her medical bills have cost $273,000, and her anticipated
rehabilitation costs top $365,000, according to her attorney.</TE>

<HD>Charges Dropped in Gang-Rape Case</HD>
<DH>Four San Fernando Valley college students were accused of
drugging a Simi Valley woman. The investigation continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite early assertions that the case was solid, prosecutors this
week dropped felony charges against four San Fernando Valley college
students accused of drugging and gang-raping a former Simi Valley
teen.</LD>
<LD>   The decision made Tuesday by the Ventura County district
attorney's office means Brian Jafari, Yan Karim, Jeffrey Pineda], all
20, and Dejon Lee, 22, will not stand trial. Each had potentially
faced a sentence of 40 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   "They are so relieved that the matter is behind them," said
Richard M. Sudar, Lee's attorney. "Four young men just spent a year
of their lives proving their innocence."</LD>
<TE>   The foursome -- each of whom had been free on $250,000 bail since
the alleged Jan. 11 incident -- maintained their innocence from the
start, and all hired private attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice was finally done," said Pineda's attorney, Leonard
Levine. "The district attorney's office took the right step in
dismissing this case."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. David M. Lehr, the case prosecutor,
declined to comment on the decision, saying the case remained under
investigation and charges could be refiled if new evidence is found.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-day preliminary hearing in August in which the men
were ordered to stand trial, Lehr said his case was strong and that
he intended to try the men separately and use their statements to
police against each other.</TE>
<TE>   Sudar said Wednesday that he believed the case was weakened by
inconsistencies in the victim's account and because the four men each
took polygraph tests that showed that the alleged sex acts that
occurred were consensual.</TE>
<TE>   Polygraph tests are not admissible in court, but prosecutors had
received the results in this case as part of the discovery process.</TE>
<TE>   Lehr would not discuss the tests but said his office does not
consider them in deciding how to handle a case.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, the alleged victim, 18, knew Pineda and
previously had sex with him. On Jan. 11, she invited him to the Simi
Valley home where she was renting a room.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after midnight, Pineda showed up with three friends, and
the five went to the kitchen and drank rum before going to the
woman's bedroom to watch a movie, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim, according to her own court statements, said
that after about 20 minutes her vision became blurred and she began
to feel weak.</TE>
<TE>   She said that the next thing she remembered was glancing at a
clock about 3:30 a.m. and realizing that two of the men were sexually
assaulting her.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys challenged her credibility at the preliminary
hearing, eliciting testimony in which she admitted locking her
bedroom door after the four men went inside.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim has since returned to her home state of
Virginia. The men remain in the San Fernando Valley, where they
attend school.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo to Put Brakes on Drivers</HD>
<DH>A surge in accidents prompts a monthlong law enforcement
program aimed at traffic violators, especially speeders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to a sharp upswing in vehicle crashes, sheriff's deputies
in Camarillo are planning a monthlong program to crack down on
traffic violators.</LD>
<LD>   In the first 10 months of this year there were 722 crashes, up
sharply from 627 in all of 2001, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 722, more than 500 were caused by driver negligence,
including speeding, drunk driving, failing to yield for a stop sign
and other right-of-way violations, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A small portion of the crashes were attributed to widespread road
construction in and around the city, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is all too easy to discount these as 'accidents,' creating the
impression that they cannot be prevented," said Ventura County
Sheriff's Cmdr. Dave Tennessen. "In fact, very few crashes occur
because of uncontrollable circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to conduct the Strategic Traffic Enforcement Plan
also resulted from a survey this year of residents, who said speeding
was the leading problem in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing a problem of growing public contempt for speed
limits, traffic signs, traffic signals and an increase in distracted
driving," Tennessen said.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials won't say when it will start, the traffic
enforcement plan includes having all motorcycle deputies, accident
investigators and specially assigned detectives patrolling for
traffic violators.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department, whose deputies function as city police,
also plans to place three radar trailers in high traffic areas to
show drivers' their speed by flashing it on a screen.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessen said creating the enforcement plan reflects a growing
trend among law enforcement to get drivers to slow down.</TE>
<TE>   The commander cited a 2001 federal study in which respondents said
that they were more concerned about being in a traffic accident than
about being a victim of a violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Proactive traffic enforcement efforts can prevent many crashes
from occurring," Tennessen said.</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda Seeks to Rescind Development Vote</HD>
<DH>A new council majority is trying to undo the previous
board's approval for up to 1,000 homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yorba Linda's new City Council majority, diving into an already
furiously tangled political battle, will try to undo last-minute
approval for up to 1,000 new homes in the hills above the Riverside
Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Within an hour of being sworn in Tuesday night, Councilwoman Keri
Lynn Wilson joined Mark Ryan and Jim Winder in directing city
attorneys and staff to devise a way to rescind the earlier council
votes.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly this is one of the biggest issues that's faced our
community in the 12 years I've been here. My sense is it was rushed
through in November," Wilson said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to live with the benefits and the consequences
forever, and I think it's important that we seriously evaluate it."</TE>
<TE>   Angry residents who have spent weeks gathering thousands of
signatures to overturn the approvals, by citywide ballot if
necessary, said they would still present their petitions at City Hall
today, the deadline for requesting such a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't rely on anything that hasn't happened yet ... so we're
still plugging away," said Tricia Darling, a seven-year resident who
along with her husband has spearheaded the door-to-door campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Shappell Industries of Beverly Hills won approval at
1:30 a.m. on Nov. 6 -- just hours after polls closed on election day
-- to change the city's General Plan. The amendments eliminated open
space in favor of new homes, allowed a major extension to Bastanchury
Road and increased density in the area from about 300 homes to about
1,000 homes, including 385 apartments or townhomes for senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate deal the day before the election, Shappell agreed to
sell 40 acres to the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District
for a long-sought high school and to spend $9 million to $15 million
grading the steep site and bringing in water and power lines.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the developer said they would do everything
necessary to hang onto the approvals, including suing the city if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We will resist any effort to take our entitlements away," said
consulting project manager Lyle Overby.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over the North Yorba Linda Estates development is just
the latest skirmish in an already bitterly divided city. In recent
years there have been unsuccessful petition drives to block the
widening of Imperial Highway and to recall pro-development Councilman
John Gullixson.</TE>
<TE>   As the current drive has gained momentum, so has opposition.
Pickets have appeared outside grocery stores next to the petition
gatherers. Newspaper ads and mailers paid for by Shappell warn that
the referendum would delay construction of the high school for years.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. Dennis Smith said he is not taking a position on the
petition drive but mailed a letter to parents cautioning that a
referendum could inadvertently stall construction of the high school,
the city's first.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ken Ryan, who brought Tuesday's motion to overturn the
approvals, said rushed planning and last-minute votes would be at
fault if the high school stalled. He said Shappell should consider
donating the land to the city for the high school and eliminating 11
homes on a ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Shappell and a political action committee run
by Overby donated thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to
outgoing Councilman Gullixson and two other councilmen who voted in
favor of the development.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign records show that Gullixson had received $4,500 from
Shappell since 1998, and similar donations were made to the other two
supporters, as well as opponent Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides denied any quid-pro-quo arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't write checks unless we're asked," said Overby, who said
there was no promise to vote for the development in exchange for the
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "John Gullixson can't be bought," said Gullixson, a past mayor and
12-year councilman who chose not to run in the most recent election.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Kiley, a community-affairs staffer for Shappell who lives
in the developer's 2,100-unit East Lake Village project, pointed out
that many foes of North Yorba Linda Estates also live in homes built
by the company. She also noted that the developer was donating 1,200
acres of open space.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, we all live in East Lake Village, which is a huge,
beautiful project, and you know, what's interesting is most of these
little petition gatherers are just NIMBYs. It's the same old thing as
everywhere: 'Hey, I got my castle, let's pull up the bridge.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Darling, one of the petition-drive organizers, said that they
are not opposed to responsible development but that the approved
projects would irrevocably change the city's stated goal of
preserving its rural equestrian character in hillside areas. He said
traffic, noise, effects on wildlife and other issues were not
addressed during the approval process. He and others said they tried
to follow the legal process to make reasonable changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were ignored," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said he would like to sit down and have a reasonable
discussion with the developer about how to do the project properly.</TE>
<TE>   Overby said it would be difficult to renegotiate the previous
council's actions, which came after nearly two years of planning and
environmental impact studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Independent of [Ryan's] rhetoric, you don't just sit down on a
given day and start coloring maps like you're in kindergarten," he
said. "The jury is out on what's going to happen."</TE>

<HD>Racing to Reveal Drunk-Driving Dangers</HD>
<DH>Video game and special goggles simulate an intoxicating
experience behind the wheel.</DH>

<LD>Giggling as her car smashed into concrete barriers and then skidded
onto the sidewalk, Cristy Chen had a simulated drunk-driving
experience that was almost too believable.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-year-old Cypress College sophomore was playing a race car
video game while wearing an eyesight-warping pair of goggles intended
to replicate the effects of a six-pack of beer. She was rehearsing
for an event her youth leadership group is putting on tonight at The
Block in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no judgment, no idea what's real," said Chen, an alumni
member of the Orange County Friday Night Live Partnership Youth
Advisory Council. "And this is just my vision that's affected. I
wouldn't even want to know how badly I'd drive if I weren't thinking
straight."</LD>
<TE>   Members of the council -- a dozen students from across the county
who actively discourage the use of alcohol and drugs -- hope the
drunk-driving simulation will convince their peers they aren't
invincible to the danger of drinking and driving.</TE>
<TE>   Friday Night Live is a statewide youth coalition formed in 1984 to
make sure teens have access to safe rides home on Friday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Sebastian Restrepo, a 17-year-old senior at Sunny Hills High in
Fullerton, suggested the video game event and asked the state group
for funding last December.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted us to get back to those roots of encouraging safe
driving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A $7,500 grant from the state group and other sponsorships are
paying for the no-drinking-and-driving campaign, timed to coincide
with start of the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The evening will begin with the 6 p.m. unveiling of a billboard
depicting a skateboarder on one side and a hearse on the other, and a
message that reads "What Kind of Ride Do You Want Out of Life?"</TE>
<TE>   During a vigil, audience and council members will carry 61
candles, one for each person killed in alcohol-related vehicle
collisions last year in Orange County. Simulation participants will
wear Fatal Vision goggles and compete against others not handicapped
by the eyewear.</TE>
<TE>   During her practice run on the simulated race car drive Wednesday,
council member Miranda Wang uprooted several trees and a newspaper
vending machine.</TE>
<TE>   "Teenagers need something like this to prove to them that even
things we do every day, like playing video games, are totally
different once you've been drinking," said Miranda, 17, a senior at
Foothill High in North Tustin.</TE>

<HD>Come What May</HD>
<DH>It didn't take long for Bob May to go from a memorable PGA
shootout to Q-school</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>Bob May has a back so badly strained that he hasn't played golf in
more than two weeks. The two bulging disks doctors diagnosed a year
and a half ago flared up again and his back hurts so much he should
probably rest it at least another month.</LD>
<LD>   Still, May is playing this week at PGA West. He's not doing it for
the money -- this isn't some made-for-television special event where
even the last-place finishers walk away with fat paydays -- he's
doing it because he has to. This is the PGA Tour Qualifying
Tournament -- otherwise known as Q-school.</LD>
<LD>   It's six rounds of pressure-packed golf where one bad shot could
mean the difference between playing among the world's best on the
ritzy PGA Tour and toiling in relative obscurity on the Nationwide
Tour. If May doesn't play -- if he doesn't finish among the top 35 --
he won't have full-time status on the PGA Tour next year.</LD>
<TE>   That's right, the same guy who went shot for shot with Tiger Woods
in the PGA Championship only two years ago is back in Q-school. The
guy who shares the PGA Championship scoring record with Woods after
the two finished regulation in the 2000 PGA tied at 18-under-par 270
has to earn his way back to the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Woods beat May by one stroke in a three-hole playoff that hot day
in August 2000 at Valhalla Country Club in Louisville, Ky. One stroke
separated May and one of the greatest players ever. One stroke kept
him from a major championship and the automatic five-year PGA Tour
exemption that comes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's back in Q-school, playing 108 holes over six days trying
to earn back the opportunity to compete with the world's best. Such
is the fickle nature of golf.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would have to come back here," said May, 34,
who overcame his back problems Wednesday and is tied for eighth after
a first-round, four-under 68. "Not at the time of the PGA. But that's
golf."</TE>
<TE>   Q-school will be played over the Jack Nicklaus Tournament and TPC
Stadium courses at PGA West. The final round will be Monday, after
which they will hand out PGA Tour cards. At Sherwood Country Club 150
miles away, the biggest PGA Tour stars are playing for a $1-million
first prize and a guaranteed $130,000 in the Target World Challenge.
Here at Q-school, 171 players ranging from former U.S. Amateur
champions to former NCAA champions to former PGA Tour winners are
playing for their careers.</TE>
<TE>   There are always young, unknown hotshots among the players
scrambling to make the big tour, but this year there are a surprising
number of accomplished players such as May trying to earn back their
cards. Steve Pate, Scott Simpson and Bill Glasson are among a group
of 19 former PGA Tour winners in the field who have combined for 51
tour victories. There are 59 former Buy.com Tour winners in the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Pate is a six-time PGA Tour winner and a member of two Ryder Cup
teams, including one as recently as 1999. Simpson, winner of seven
PGA Tour events since 1980, won the 1987 U.S. Open at the Olympic
Club. Bill Glasson, another seven-time PGA Tour winner, and Ken
Green, a member of the 1989 Ryder Cup team, also are in the field.
Andy Miller and Matt Weibring, sons of former PGA Tour stars Johnny
and D.A, are playing, as is Casey Martin, the man who made the golf
cart famous.</TE>
<TE>   All are gunning for another shot at glory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible, the caliber of this field," May said. "You've
got young players coming out of college, superstars. It's a wide
variety of players, but it's not like 'who's this guy or who's that
guy?' The guys who get through this are gonna earn it."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to tell a player who made $407,778 on the 2002 PGA
Tour that he had a bad year, but that's what happened to May. He
finished 138th on the money list and lost his unconditional status.
Only the top 125 retain full playing privileges.</TE>
<TE>   There are other exemptions. May, for example, has conditional
status because he finished among the top 150. That means he could get
into about 20 events, but he wants more.</TE>
<TE>   "[The PGA Tour] is where I want to play," May said. "It's the only
thing I want to play on, but if I don't make it, it's not the end of
my life. I've still got a great family, a beautiful wife and
beautiful kids. But it's a way of making a living for me. I wouldn't
want to do it any other way if I have my choice."</TE>
<TE>   May is hoping to survive six rounds. He first blew out his back
during the 2001 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic here. He took 12 weeks off
before returning to play and finished 94th on the money list. This
year, playing through the pain, he didn't fare quite as well. In 30
tournaments, he missed 13 cuts and had to withdraw twice. He didn't
have a top-10 finish.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago in a tournament in China, May felt as if his game
was coming back. He finished fourth, a few strokes behind winner
Colin Montgomerie. The following Monday, on the sixth hole of the
pro-am for the same tournament, his back gave out again. He could
barely walk and had doubts about playing in Q-school this week.</TE>
<TE>   "With my back, I'm just happy to make it around and get back to
the clubhouse without being brought back in a golf cart right now,"
May said. "I don't know if my back will last or not.</TE>
<TE>   "At times I'm holding back, I'm afraid to rotate. I'm afraid it's
not going to last for six rounds, but I'll get over it. I gotta get
over it."</TE>
<TE>   After all, this is Q-school.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rather than put only one person in charge, the Baltimore Orioles
hired Jim Beattie and Mike Flanagan to turn around a franchise mired
in a run of five consecutive losing seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Beattie on Wednesday was hired as executive vice president of
baseball operations. He will work with Flanagan, who was hired to
succeed Syd Thrift as vice president of baseball operations.</LD>
<LD>   The former major league pitchers will fill the job commonly known
as general manager.</LD>
<TE>   "The belief is that the job has grown to be very large, very
complex, very diverse," said Joe Foss, the Orioles' chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "You really need at least two people at the most senior levels of
a baseball organization to be able to meet all the challenges of the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Beattie, 48, pitched nine years in the majors with the New York
Yankees and Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   He was director of player development with the Mariners from
1989-94, then was vice president and general manager of the Montreal
Expos from 1995-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, 50, is a former Oriole left-hander who served as a TV
broadcaster for the team the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't have the front-office knowledge that Beattie does, but
is thought to have a better grasp of the Orioles and their minor
league system.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Robin Ventura and the Yankees reached a preliminary
agreement on a $5-million, one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura, 35, must pass a physical for the deal to be finalized, a
Yankee official said on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura batted .247 with 27 homers and 93 runs batted in last
season, his first with the Yankees, who acquired him from the New
York Mets in a three-way trade in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura earned $8.25 million in 2002.</TE>

<KH>MORNING BRIEFING</KH>
<HD>Thome's Reasoning Is Off Base to Some</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Pluto of the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal cited three reasons
Jim Thome left the Cleveland Indians to sign with the Philadelphia
Phillies:</LD>
<LD>   $$$</LD>
<LD>   "Thome was the Cleveland Indians to most fans, standing for what
was supposed to be all the right things about baseball," Pluto wrote.
"But now, he sold himself to the highest bidder. Now he's just a
hired bat in Philadelphia, where it will be interesting to see how
the fans react when he has his usual dismal April, hitting much less
than his weight of 240."</LD>
<TE>   Added Pluto: "He's a Midwestern guy, a native of Peoria, Ill., who
grew up a Cub fan and then fell in love with Cleveland once he signed
with the Indians in 1989. He had no interest in playing for the
Phillies other than they came calling with a fistful of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Another view: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer called
Thome's signing an unexpected coup.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in the city where losing teams are regarded as a birthright
and championships seem to be limited to one per generation, the
sporting news is suddenly top-heavy with promise," he wrote. "The
news is so good, we may not be able to stand it, let alone handle
it.... The city that braces always for the next bit of bad news now
has to chew on uncommon good fortune. Relax. It tastes just like
chicken."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which NHL coach won the most Stanley Cup
championships without coaching the Montreal Canadiens?</TE>
<TE>   Big Mac: Teammates of pitcher Dave McNally, who died Sunday of
cancer, remembered him as a quiet but strong man who was integral to
the Baltimore Orioles' success.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught a lot of 20-game winners," catcher Andy Etchebarren told
the Baltimore Sun. "Nolan Ryan, Frank Tanana when he first came up,
and Jim [Palmer] is going to be mad at me, but I always say Dave
McNally is absolutely the best pitcher I ever caught."</TE>
<TE>   Said former Oriole outfielder Don Buford: "He helped make our
great clubs go. You knew every time he went out there you'd get a
complete game or close to it."</TE>
<TE>   Just say no: Arizona Republic columnist Pedro Gomez declared the
Cardinals the worst franchise in professional sports after their 49-0
loss to Kansas City and suggested fans protest their ineptitude by
boycotting Sunday's game against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has not earned the right to have fans in the stands,"
he wrote. "The ultimate statement needs to be sent to ownership....
Even though Sunday's game represents the Cardinals' best chance to
stop what could be a disastrous 10-game losing streak -- St. Louis,
San Francisco and Denver follow the Lions' visit -- don't go.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't buy a ticket. If you've already bought one, don't show up."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Hap Day, who won five with the Toronto Maple Leafs
from 1942-49.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Darryl Sutter, fired as coach of the San Jose Sharks
Sunday, didn't linger to hear General Manager Dean Lombardi's
explanation. "I wasn't interested in listening, because it's always
the cliches that you read in the paper," Sutter told the San Jose
Mercury News. "When coaches in any sport are let go, they're all the
same."</TE>

<LD>Chris Hill scored 22 points and Aloysius Anagonye added 10 points and
nine rebounds as No. 21 Michigan State defeated No. 22 Virginia,
82-75, Wednesday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference-Big Ten
Challenge at East Lansing, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   The Spartans held Virginia scoreless for over six minutes during a
17-0 run to take a 33-19 lead with 4:19 left in the half.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought there were stretches where we played as hard as we have
in a couple years," Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo said. "I didn't
realize we had a 17-0 run. That's good. A lot of that came off our
defense, and that makes it even more impressive. We didn't do that
last year."</LD>
<TE>   The Spartans (3-2) avoided their first losing record since 1995
when they started 1-2 in Izzo's first season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about Michigan State pride," Anagonye said.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia (3-2) lost to Indiana in the Maui Invitational final
after beating Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "They were holding us, grabbing us and mugging us, but that's the
way the game was played," Virginia Coach Pete Gillen said. "You've
got to adjust to the game and we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Todd Billet had 28 points for Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Oregon 96, Portland 66 -- Luke Jackson had 21 points and 12
rebounds and Luke Ridnour scored 17 points as the Ducks (4-0) routed
the Pilots (3-1) at Eugene, Ore. Portland defeated Oregon, 79-78,
last season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Kansas 97, Central Missouri State 70 -- Keith Langford had
23 points as the Jayhawks (3-2) won for the first time in three
games, rolling past the Mules (4-1) at Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Tulsa 80, Wichita State 69 -- Jason Parker scored a
career-high 30 points, including a school-record eight three-point
baskets, to lead the Golden Hurricane (4-0) to its 13th consecutive
victory over the Shockers (2-2) at Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Minnesota 64, Georgia Tech 63 -- Rick Rickert scored 17
points, including the go-ahead turnaround jump shot with nine seconds
left, to lift the Golden Gophers (3-0) past the Yellow Jackets (3-1)
at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest 90, No. 23 Wisconsin 80 -- At Madison, Wis.,</TE>
<TE>   Josh Howard scored a career-high 31 points and Justin Gray had 20
points for Demon Deacons (3-0), as the Badgers (4-1) had their home

<HD>Heat Feels Good to Clippers</HD>
<DH>L.A. wins a battle of struggling teams, 89-80, thanks to a
big game from Brand and big shots from Piatkowski.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If not Wednesday, then when?</LD>
<LD>   If not the Miami Heat, then....</LD>
<LD>   These are indeed difficult times for the Clippers. There is zero
margin for error. Especially when their starting center is on the
injured list because of a bout with tendinitis in his left knee and
their top two small forwards also are out because of ankle and knee
injuries and their point guard is limping around on a sprained ankle.</LD>
<TE>   Leaving nothing to chance, the Clippers jumped on the Heat early
and paused only briefly before taking an 89-80 victory before 14,015
relieved customers at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was only the Clippers' fourth in 11 games at Staples
and their seventh in 19 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Without center Michael Olowokandi and forwards Corey Maggette and
Lamar Odom, and with guard Andre Miller playing on a bum ankle, the
Clippers kept it simple against the punchless Heat.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers went to Elton Brand on the low block again and again.
When that failed, Eric Piatkowski stepped behind the three-point arc
and made the Heat pay for collapsing on Brand.</TE>
<TE>   Miller kept things moving smoothly despite a sprained ankle that
had forced him to sit out Sunday's loss to the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Brand scored 25 points, took 13 rebounds and added five blocks.
Piatkowski scored 18 points on six-for-13 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had 13 points, including 11 in the first quarter, and added
seven assists in 32 minutes. He did not play down the stretch,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to complain about a win," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "At this stage, we've got to get a win any way we can.
Elton played well. Andre gave us what he could. He's still sore. He's
got to be really sore if I've got him sitting over there at the end
of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Heat went on a 15-6 run to start the fourth quarter but never
got closer than nine points. Miami's 33-for-88 shooting from the
field (37.5%) and 10-for-23 shooting from the free-throw line (43.5%)
was too much to overcome against the steady if unspectacular
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "We had control of the game for the entire game," Brand said. "I'm
glad we finished them off. This is a good win for us."</TE>
<TE>   The start was all too predictable, even with the Clippers hurting.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, who never trailed, built a 12-2 lead against the
Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, which went into the game shooting 40.2% and averaging a
meager 83.7 points, was up to form from the start. The Heat is
nothing without center Alonzo Mourning, sidelined indefinitely by a
kidney illness.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the Clippers held a 49-37 lead despite several lapses
in intensity and interest. Miami used an 8-1 run to pull within 38-35
after Travis Best made a jump shot. But Piatkowski made a free throw
and two three-pointers to lead an 11-2 Clipper surge to end the half.</TE>
<TE>   With a 5-13 record, the Heat has looked for any advantage it can
find. Monday, that meant Pat Riley used a zone defense for the first
time in 21 years of coaching, and the Heat pulled out a 100-90
overtime victory over the Suns at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   No dummy, Riley went to the zone again periodically against the
Clippers. The Heat had its moments in the zone, especially during the
second quarter, when the Clippers appeared tentative and befuddled at
times on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, thanks in part to Piatkowski's sharp outside
shooting, they extended their lead to double-digits by halftime. The
advantage would swell to 18 in the fourth quarter, the last time at
79-61 after Brand's medium-range jumper with 7:30 left.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to find a way to win games," Gentry said. "Regardless
if they're ugly or pretty, right now we've just got to get our
confidence up."</TE>

<HD>Miller Returns After Missing Game</HD>

<LD>Andre Miller tested his sprained left ankle at Wednesday's morning
shootaround and it was determined he was fit enough to play later
against the Miami Heat. Miller sat out only his second NBA game in
three-plus seasons Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to play him until he says he can't play," Coach Alvin
Gentry said.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry acknowledged that some players fib to coaches and team
medical personnel about their conditions in order to keep playing.
Gentry said he had no choice but to trust Miller in this case.</LD>
<TE>   "He's smart enough, he's been in the NBA long enough to understand
[when to sit out]," Gentry said. "I told him to be as honest as he
can be with me. I don't want anybody being a hero."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who was then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, was sidelined
for one game last season because of a bruised right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   He did not miss a game in either of his first two seasons in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Miller sound for Wednesday's game against the Heat, Gentry
returned Quentin Richardson to his role as the team's first
substitute.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Eric Piatkowski started at the guard spots with Melvin
Ely at center and Marko Jaric and Elton Brand at the forward
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry isn't expecting a great deal from Ely, a rookie from Fresno
State who played in his fourth game Wednesday after sitting out most
of training camp and the season's first month because of a sprained
left foot. Not yet, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also said he would continue to start Ely over Wang Zhi-
zhi. "Melvin is a better rebounder and a more physical player,"
Gentry said.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Hoop City"</LD>
<TE>   Authors: Scott Blumenthal and Brett Hodus</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Scobre Press Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $9.95</TE>
<TE>   This entertaining, 138-page paperback that became available this
week tells the story of fictional basketball players Tony and Mike
Hope, twin brothers from Harlem. Mike ends up with the wrong people
in the wrong place and is crippled by a gunshot wound. Tony struggles
to make it without his twin as a teammate but triumphs in the end.
And, in his own way, so does Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Written to appeal to students ages 9-14, the book provides an
uplifting story that teaches lessons in life and also teaches young
people that reading can be fun. At the end of the book is a test to
determine how much information a reader has retained.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoop City" is the second book written by Scott Blumenthal, 24,
and Brett Hodus, 23, who have created a publishing company, Scobre
Press Corp. of La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Their first book, "The Road to the Majors," came out earlier this
year and sold more than 50,000 copies in three months. It tells the
fictional story of Jimmy Hanks, whose troubles in the minor leagues
consist of more than hitting and fielding. He has a scary experience
with a couple of robbers who break into his motel room.</TE>
<TE>   The two books are prototypes for 21 more being written by other
young writers for Scobre Press Crop.</TE>
<TE>   Blumenthal, who went to USC, and Hodus, who attended New York
University, met in 1999 while taking part in the University of
Pittsburgh's "semester at sea" program. They discovered they both
loved sports and writing. And it appears they have put those loves to
good use.</TE>

<HD>Leclerc Hopes to Return to Lineup This Month</HD>

<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Forward Mike Leclerc, who has been sidelined since Nov. 15 because of
a knee injury, has been skating for more than a week and is close to
returning to the Mighty Ducks' lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as I know where I'm skating, it's fine," said Leclerc,
who had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Nov. 19. "But as soon
as I have to start reacting, that's when the pain comes. It's not as
stable yet. But every day, I'm able to go a little bit harder, and
I'm getting close."</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc, who plans to practice today with his teammates for the
first time since his injury, is hoping to return before a Ducks' trip
that starts Dec. 26 at San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   "Losing is tough, period. But when you're not playing and the team
is losing, that makes it even [tougher]," said Leclerc, one of the
Ducks' top players the first two months of the season. "I don't want
to hurry back and have any setbacks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock didn't find much encouraging in the Ducks' 4-0
loss at Buffalo on Wednesday, but he did like the play of backup
goaltender Martin Gerber.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Gerber was the only positive sign," Babcock said. "It
was obvious to me that we were flat mentally and physically....
Gerber was by himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei did not play for the third time in four
games because of an injury to his back and abdomen.</TE>

<HD>Sabres Rise Up Against the Ducks</HD>
<DH>Brown gets hat trick as last-place Buffalo wins, 4-0.
Kariya says effort by Anaheim is lacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Just when it looked as if the Mighty Ducks were turning a corner,
they play a game like they did Wednesday, losing, 4-0, to the lowly
Buffalo Sabres.</LD>
<LD>   In losing for the second time in as many nights, the Ducks failed
to mount any offensive punch against Buffalo goaltender Martin Biron,
who made 22 saves for his first shutout of the season in front of an
announced crowd of 10,433 at HSBC Arena.</LD>
<LD>   "You're not going to win every game, but effort is something
that's controllable," captain Paul Kariya said about the Ducks, who
are 1-3-3-1 over their last eight games, including a 2-1 loss at
Detroit on Tuesday. "We didn't have a good effort tonight for
whatever reason. Partly mental and partly physical."</LD>
<TE>   Buffalo, which has a league-low 15 points this season, received a
huge game from center Curtis Brown, who scored three goals for his
first hat trick this season. Winger Jean-Pierre Dumont added the
other goal for the Sabres, who outshot the Ducks, 36-22.</TE>
<TE>   Brown who has six goals in nine games since sitting out Nov. 12,
notched the ninth multiple-goal game of his career. The shutout was
the 12th of Biron's career.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a desperate team and we didn't match their
desperation," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, which featured three power-play
opportunities for the Ducks, Buffalo took a 1-0 lead early in the
second when Dumont beat goaltender Martin Gerber, who started in
place of Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being surrounded by Duck defensemen Kurt Sauer and Keith
Carney, Dumont was able to get off a shot from the top of the crease
to score at 5:13. It was his fifth goal this season.</TE>
<TE>   "[Buffalo forward Stu] Barnes had the puck behind the net and
tried to pass it off the stick of [Dumont] in front, and I had that
covered," Sauer said. "But the puck hit off our goalie in front and
it went straight ahead behind my back and [Dumont] just backed up and
backhanded it in."</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres, who extended their unbeaten streak to six games
against the Ducks, scored again later in the period.</TE>
<TE>   With Buffalo on a power play, Brown was left alone at the right
circle and scored off a rebound at 16:52.</TE>
<TE>   The goal ended the Sabres' 0-for-28 slump with a man advantage,
dating to Nov. 19 at New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who dropped to 1-7-1 when they trail after two periods,
watched any chance for a comeback disappear when Brown scored his
second goal of the game with a blast from the right wing 23 seconds
into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who had only three goals before Wednesday's game, finished
the Ducks at 12:47 when he scored his third goal while diving to the
ice near the slot.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber had made a pad save on Miroslav Satan's shot from the
point, and Brian Campbell leaped across the slot to provide a screen
as Brown fired the rebound into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a huge game for [the Sabres]," Duck Coach Mike Babcock
said. "They came out and outworked us from the start to the end. They
deserve credit for that."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have already played four sets of games on
successive days this season, conclude their three-game trip Friday at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't use [the schedule] as an excuse because everyone in the
league has to play back-to-back games," Kariya said. "You just have
to win those games."</TE>

<HD>Erstad Surgery Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Angels on the verge of losing both of their reserve
outfielders, center fielder Darin Erstad is scheduled to undergo
surgery today to repair an injury to his right hand. Erstad is
expected to be ready for spring training.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad complained of soreness in the hand during the final weekend
of the World Series, "but it didn't seem like a big issue," General
Manager Bill Stoneman said. When the soreness did not resolve itself
with six weeks of rest, doctors ordered an examination Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The examination revealed a fracture in the hook of the hamate
bone, an injury not uncommon among hitters. The hook will be removed
during surgery today.</LD>
<TE>   Erstad said he believed he suffered the injury on a swing in San
Francisco during the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "By the second day, I could barely grab the bat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He received treatment and remained in the lineup as the Angels won
the Series, and he and the medical staff hoped the soreness would
disappear with rest.</TE>
<TE>   When it did not -- "I tried to golf a few times. I couldn't even
swing a club," he said -- he got an X-ray and a CT scan that revealed
the fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said he was told he would be 100% in six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said it is "not likely" the Angels will offer salary
arbitration to reserve outfielders Orlando Palmeiro and Alex Ochoa by
Saturday's deadline, thus losing negotiating rights to both players.
The Angels are interested in the players but not in risking a
potential arbitration hearing that could result in a raise for
Palmeiro, who made $1 million last season, or Ochoa, who made $2.75
million.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said he has had "limited conversations" with the agent
for Ochoa and more extensive discussions with the agents for Palmeiro
as well as other veteran free-agent outfielders. He also said he
believes minor league outfielders Robb Quinlan and Nathan Haynes
could compete for backup outfield spots, although Quinlan probably
would be limited to left field and Haynes would appear to need
another year of offensive seasoning at triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>

<HD>Pick-Six Player Takes First Step</HD>
<DH>In class-action suit, Allard says fraud in betting isn't
limited to what happened at Breeders' Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after the 4-year-old colt Volponi crossed the finish line at
Arlington Park on Oct. 26, as an easy winner of the Breeders' Cup
Classic at 43-1, Jimmy "The Hat" Allard stood with two friends from
California under a TV monitor at Arlington Park, awaiting the posting
of the pick-six results.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the screen showed that six tickets had been sold with all
six winners, each worth $428,392. In Allard's pocket were pick-six
tickets that had cost $21,504. The best this professional horseplayer
from Santa Monica could do was pick four winners, which was not worth
anything.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no way anybody could have all six winners," Allard said
to his friends. "And six winning tickets? This is impossible."</LD>
<TE>   Two of the six races were won by favorites, but the other three,
before Volponi, were won by horses that went off at 26-1, 13-1 and
4-1. A $2 win parlay -- starting with $2, and betting your cumulative
winnings on the right horse, through all six races -- would have paid
almost $309,000.</TE>
<TE>   The six winning pick-six tickets -- worth $3,067,821.60, counting
108 consolation payoffs for having five winners -- allegedly belonged
to Derrick Davis, a Baltimore bettor who made a $1,152 bet to his
phone account in New York. But it turned out, according to a guilty
plea to federal conspiracy charges made by Chris Harn on Nov. 21,
that Harn, a computer programmer for the Autotote company that
processed the bets, had altered Davis' tickets after the first four
races had been run, assuring them of having all six winners. Davis
and another man, Glen DaSilva, also have been charged in the scam,
but have entered no pleas.</TE>
<TE>   "They were telling me in Chicago that I had a case of sour
grapes," said Allard, a former Hollywood bit player and stuntman who
has been playing the pick six on a regular basis at Hollywood Park,
Santa Anita and Del Mar since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Allard, 48, has become the poster bettor for a class-action
lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, that
charges Autotote and its parent company, Scientific Games Corp., with
negligence and deceptive and unfair practices, not only on Breeders'
Cup day but for several years before. The suit, filed by Allard's
attorneys, Joseph and Gail Lisoni of Pasadena, seeks compensatory and
punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "The Breeders' Cup pick six was arguably the largest wagering
fraud in North American thoroughbred racing history," said Joseph
Lisoni, who bets the pick six himself and has invested in racehorses.
"It is a black eye on the sport of horse racing. In order to preserve
the integrity of the sport and avoid having bettors defrauded in the
future, we have to hold those who erred accountable. Then we need to
focus on instituting changes that will protect the betting public in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment about the suit, a spokesperson for Autotote said:
"We have heard the allegations and they are completely without
merit."</TE>
<TE>   The $3 million from the pick six has not been paid out. Because
the Breeders' Cup was run in Illinois, Monday the state racing board
there may address the redistribution of the money to
consolation-ticket holders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible how much vulnerability the betting system has
been subjected to over a long period," Allard said. "Those guys
[Davis, Harn and DaSilva] have been doing this for a couple of years,
and the opportunity was there for several others to be doing the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Autotote said this week that it is introducing new tracking
devices, available by the end of the month, that will independently
monitor bets and detect possible fraud. One of Allard's complaints
about the current tote systems is that bets aren't transferred to the
host track until after several legs of a pick six have been run.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an anti-tech person," he said, "but on Breeders' Cup day they
put my money into the system right away, so they could collect their
commissions, but meantime the horses on my ticket are flying around
in cyberspace somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "For 2 1/2 hours, the ticket is vulnerable. That's one of the most
outrageous parts of this whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Allard also believes that bets are being made on races after they
start.</TE>
<TE>   Tracks have uncovered no evidence of this, despite numerous
dramatic odds shifts while races are being run. The official
explanation is that the bets aren't funneled into the system in real
time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spend A Buck, who won the Kentucky Derby and was voted horse of
the year in 1985, died last month in Brazil, where he was standing at
stud. Few details were available about the 20-year-old stallion.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death was listed as anaphylactic shock.</TE>

<HD>Quartz Hill Eyes Unbeaten Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three key players from the Quartz Hill boys' soccer team that shared
the Southern Section Division I championship last season are on
scholarship at universities.</LD>
<LD>   The team's schedule has been beefed up and the Rebels will no
longer benefit from opponents underestimating them as they might have
during their breakthrough season.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Andre Matalon, Quartz Hill's fourth-year coach, sees no reason
why the Rebels can't post their second consecutive unbeaten season
and win their first mythical national championship during the 2002-03
campaign.</LD>
<TE>   And he's not afraid to say it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of our goals," Matalon said about being the top-ranked
team in the nation at the end of the winter season. "We try and win
every game, so why not go into the season thinking we can win every
game?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying we're going to do it, but I don't think we
shouldn't make it one of our goals with the talent we have on this
team."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Taylor Sheldrick, one of six returning starters from last
season's squad that was 28-0-2 and eighth in Student Sports
magazine's final national rankings, says Matalon's national title
talk has put a "little extra pressure" on the team. But he's not too
concerned about it.</TE>
<TE>   "All the teams are going to be out for us anyway," he said. "We're
just going to have to work twice as hard."</TE>
<TE>   Quartz Hill, which tied Lawndale Leuzinger, 0-0, in the Division I
title game last season, is ranked third behind Irvine Woodbridge and
defending national champion San Jose Bellarmine Prep in the national
preseason rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder David Martin, goalkeeper Ian McClung and forward Nick
Angelillo are now at the University of San Francisco, Cal State
Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield, respectively. But Quartz Hill
has talented returning starters in midfielders Kiel McClung, Ian's
brother, and Sheldrick and Kerry Ferguson, forward El Shaddai Bent,
and defenders Zack Bursley and Randall Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have a team with a lot of speed and skill,"
Matalon said. "We're going to have a lot of offense."</TE>
<TE>   McClung was selected as the Division I offensive player of the
year after scoring 34 goals last season. He has signed with UCLA and
returned Tuesday from a training camp in Florida for the national
under-20 team. But Matalon says there's much more to Quartz Hill than
McClung.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good team," he said. "This is a good area for soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Quartz Hill outscored its opponents by a staggering 129-20 margin
last season, but a tougher schedule will no doubt reduce that margin
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Quartz Hill again will play in the Lancaster tournament, which
starts Friday, but the Simi Valley Royal tournament is no longer on
its schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Rebels will play in the Student Sports tournament in
Tampa, Fla., from Dec. 20-23 and in the Huntington Beach Marina
tournament from Dec. 26-28.</TE>
<TE>   The Student Sports tournament will feature several of the top
teams from California, Texas and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Marina tournament usually includes several high-quality
Southern Section teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita and Santa Ana Mater Dei have combined to win or
share seven Southern Section titles at the Division II or III level
in the last six seasons. But they have moved up to Division I because
of a change in the playoff format.</TE>
<TE>   A school's enrollment determined its playoff division in recent
years. This meant that teams from the same league, like Serra League
members Santa Margarita and Mater Dei, might play in different
divisions in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the strength of the league in which a team plays will
determine its playoff division. And because the five-team Serra
League is regarded as strong in boys' soccer, its top three finishers
will automatically qualify for the Division I playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem playing at the Division I level," said
Coach Curt Bauer of Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not sure it's fair for a smaller school like [Serra
League member] Bishop Montgomery. I don't want it to sound like I'm
criticizing their program or their players, but I just don't think
they have the numbers to compete at the Division I level on a regular
basis."</TE>

<LD>A preseason look at the top boys' soccer teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Woodbridge (SS-Div. II)</LD>
<LD>   The Warriors are ranked first in Student Sports' national
preseason rankings for the second consecutive year, but will that
translate into a section title? It didn't last season.</LD>
<TE>   2. Quartz Hill (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Kiel McClung is the biggest threat on a team that is ranked third
nationally and capable of scoring goals in bunches. The Rebels are
the defending Division I co-champions.</TE>
<TE>   3. Nogales (SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   The Nobles have 10 returning starters from a team that lost to
eventual champion Los Alamitos, 3-1, in the Division II semifinals.
They're ranked seventh nationally.</TE>
<TE>   4. Santa Margarita (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles made an uncharacteristically early (second round) exit
from the Division III playoffs in February, but they appear capable
of making a deep run at the Division I level this season. They're
ranked eighth in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   5. Mater Dei (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Nate Pena and forward Randy Poggio are on scholarships
at UCLA and San Jose State, respectively, but the Monarchs are
expected to battle Santa Margarita for the Serra League title.</TE>
<TE>   6. Santa Barbara (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   With eight starters and 14 lettermen returning from last season,
the Dons could contend for their second section title in three years.
They shared the Division III championship with Brea Olinda in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   7. El Dorado (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Nine starters and 13 lettermen return from a team that upset Mater
Dei, 2-1, in the Division III title game last season.</TE>
<TE>   8. Dana Hills (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Oakes, a talented transfer from Boise, Idaho, joins a Dolphin
team that has six returning starters from a squad that closed the
last season with a 17-0-3 run before being upset by Temecula Valley,
3-2, in a playoff opener.</TE>
<TE>   9. Alta Loma (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Braves lack the depth of last season's team that suffered its
only loss in the Division I semifinals but could be dangerous if a
couple of talented players can recover from injuries.</TE>
<TE>   10. Marina (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Eight starters, including six seniors, return from last year's
team that advanced to the second round of the Division II playoffs.</TE>

<LD>Valencia High running back Charles Burnley, a senior and one of the
top recruits on the West Coast, has been charged with two counts of
battery on school grounds after allegedly assaulting two classmates
in a lunchtime fight Oct. 10.</LD>
<LD>   Valencia receiver Desmond Blair, also a senior, was also charged
with two counts of battery on school grounds. Burnley and Blair will
be arraigned Wednesday at the Sylmar Juvenile Courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have one or two students assaulting one or two other
students on campus with fists and shod feet, that's serious," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Feldstern. "We get a lot of school cases, so
it's not like this is unique, but it's certainly not a couple of kids
fooling around."</LD>
<TE>   Burnley and Blair were suspended from school for five days in
October and missed a game against West Hills Chaminade.</TE>
<TE>   Burnley finished with 1,631 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns for
the Vikings, who were eliminated by San Clemente, 31-7, in the first
round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Burnley is considering Oregon State and Washington State, among
other schools.</TE>

<TE>   With the Southern Section girls' tennis individual tournament's
defending champion absent, several players will be looking to take
advantage of the opportunity in the final rounds of play today and
Friday at SeaCliff Country Club in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Canyon sophomore Tracy Lin, who won the section singles
championship over top-seeded Lindsey Nelson of Villa Park last year,
decided to sit out the high school season and is not eligible to
defend her title.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, a junior, is 43-0 in sets this season and won the Century
League singles championship for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   She had beaten Lin three times last season before Lin got the
better of her in the final.</TE>
<TE>   "She's ready to play," Villa Park Coach Sherry Smith said of
Nelson. "She's hungry. That was a tough loss last year."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the title hunt are Irvine Woodbridge senior Elizabeth
Exon, a semifinalist the last two seasons; Palm Desert senior Robyn
Baker, a quarterfinalist the last two seasons; Amanda Fink, a
much-improved sophomore from Calabasas, and Fullerton Troy freshman
Cosmina Ciobanu, the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 16 Southern California
sectional champion.</TE>
<TE>   The round of 16 and quarterfinals in singles and doubles will be
played today beginning at 11:30 a.m., with the semifinals and
championship matches Friday beginning at 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Tony Wimberly, the second-year girls' tennis coach at Pasadena
Mayfield, died Tuesday of leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   He was 43.</TE>
<TE>   Wimberly, who was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, had been
undergoing chemotherapy treatments at USC's Norris Cancer Institute
in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at Mayfield High at 3 p.m. Friday,
and a funeral service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Thomas
More Catholic Church, 2510 S. Fremont Ave., Alhambra.</TE>

<HD>Fast Times for Long Beach Poly's Jones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Rollinson might have figured out the only way to shut down Long
Beach Poly receiver Derrick Jones, who has blistered secondaries for
more than 200 yards in each of the first two rounds of the Southern
Section Division I playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to try to sprinkle holy water on about five defensive
backs," joked Rollinson, coach of a Santa Ana Mater Dei team that
must contend with Jones and the top-seeded Jackrabbits at 4 p.m.
Saturday in a semifinal game at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever defensive formula the Monarchs concoct, it certainly
won't be similar to the one Rialto Eisenhower used against Jones last
week during Poly's 43-3 victory. The Eagles put single coverage on
Jones, who responded with four catches for 229 yards and three
touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   Two of his scores came on post patterns in which he outran the
cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are not going to put a free safety behind him and are
going to run bump-and-run [coverage], how can you not go to him?"
said Poly Coach Raul Lara. "It was like, 'Go Derrick, run your post
pattern. Give the guy a juke and go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jones had similar success against Huntington Beach Edison in the
first round, catching eight passes for 215 yards and three
touchdowns. For the season, the speedy junior has 36 receptions for
1,378 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he's going to hurt us," Rollinson said. "He's going to
get his catches. What we can't have is the 80-yarder or the
70-yarder."</TE>
<TE>   Rollinson said he is not going to challenge any of his defensive
backs to take Jones out of the game single-handedly, even though he
has a talented secondary that includes Corey Boudreaux, who has a
team-high five interceptions. The Monarchs will try to contain the
6-foot-2, 175-pound Jones by committee.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he doesn't mind if Mater Dei focuses on him because it
will open up the game for receivers Alex Watson and Raymond Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how much I get the ball as long as we win," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones combines excellent route-running abilities with great speed.
He is the reigning Division I champion in the 200 meters, which he
has run in 21.2 seconds. USC has already offered a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fontana Kaiser Coach Dick Bruich passed Bloomington Coach Don
Markham and moved into 12th place on the state's all-time victory
list last week with the Cats' 27-10 win over Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   Bruich, who has 236 career victories, is seventh among active
coaches. Markham has more total victories with 279, but 44 were
achieved in Oregon. Kaiser defeated Bloomington, 51-0, in the teams'
regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Bruich has won this season with a defense that has registered five
shutouts and is holding opponents to 6.8 points a game. The
first-string defense hasn't surrendered a touchdown since a 24-21
victory over Riverside North in Week 2.</TE>
<TE>   The group is led by linebackers Omar Alvarez and defensive backs
Marcus McCliman, Antoine Cayton and Sharrod Laing, who "take people
out of their passing game," Bruich said. Defensive ends Kyle
Musselman and Dan Holbrook are key when it comes to bottling up
opponents' running games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cats will face a Victorville Victor Valley offense averaging
26 points a game in a Division VIII semifinal on Saturday at Victor
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Aaron Brown is a big reason Oxnard will make its
first semifinal appearance since 1982 when it plays host to Westlake
Village Westlake on Friday in Division IV.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, the career rushing leader for the Yellowjackets with 3,930
yards, gained 225 yards and scored four touchdowns in a school-record
49 carries last week as Oxnard defeated Ventura Buena, 28-14. It was
the seventh 200-yard game of the season for the senior, who has 2,048
yards in 302 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't look like a guy who's going to run for 225 yards,"
Oxnard Coach Mark Beckham said of the 5-10, 180-pound back. "He runs
up inside and he runs hard. He gets a lot of the yards because of
what his linemen do up front and our other backs do."</TE>
<TE>   Brown needs 136 yards to pass Buena's Alex Garfio as the leading
rusher in Ventura County this season. Oxnard (11-1), which suffered
its loss to Valencia, is seeking its second section title and first
since 1928.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teams that failed to heed the section's edict requiring use of
Spalding footballs apparently got the message last week. After 12
teams were cited for failing to use section-approved balls in the
first round, no teams were reported out of compliance in the
quarterfinals, section spokesman Thom Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmdale Coach Jeff Williams said only one of six balls used
during his team's home victory over Compton Dominguez bore the
Spalding label.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll use it as much as we can, but it won't be our main game
ball," said Williams, whose team plays at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame in
a Division III semifinal on Friday. "We've been using Wilson all
year. We're not too keen on the Spalding. It's not our ball of
choice."</TE>
<TE>   The section warned last month that teams could face a financial
penalty or loss of future home playoff dates for failure to use the
balls. Simmons said Commissioner Jim Staunton will decide which
punishment to implement after the season. Spalding is paying the
section $75,000 a year in sponsorship money for five years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Graves of Pasadena Muir finished tied for fourth in section
history with 106 receptions this season. Graves, whose catches netted
1,499 yards and 16 touchdowns, is tied with J.K. McKay of La Puente
Bishop Amat, who had 106 receptions in 1969. Pepe Villasenor of
Ventura St. Bonaventure set the record in 1996 with 111
receptions.... Huntington Beach Brethren Christian junior quarterback
Denny Warden is closing in on a 2,000-yard passing and 1,000-yard
rushing season. The junior has passed for 1,980 yards with 19
touchdowns and has rushed for 957 yards with 13 touchdowns. He also
has 64 yards receiving and has made 70 tackles.... Tickets for the
Division I semifinals at Edison Field on Saturday, good for
admittance to both games, are $12 for club level, $10 for general
admission, $4 for students and $4 for children 13-under. Tickets are
available at the participating high schools through Friday and at
Edison Field on Saturday. Student tickets will not be sold Saturday.
Parking is $7 and the gates will open at 2:30 p.m.... Bellflower St.
John Bosco Coach Kiki Mendoza will break down the Division I matchups
at 6:30 p.m. today on Fox Sports Net's Los Angeles Times High School
Spotlight Show.</TE>

<LD>A couple of camera-shy veterans will run today at Hollywood Park,
which heads into the final 14 days of its fall meet.</LD>
<LD>   Woking, who is 0 for 16 since the beginning of 2001, will try for
his fifth lifetime victory in the fourth race while Sharp Boi, who is
one for 34 in his career, is among nine scheduled to go in the
seventh.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Ricardo Rivera and trained by Doug O'Neill, Woking is
among the contenders in the 1 1/16-mile race for $10,000 claimers.</LD>
<TE>   Besides his lengthy losing streak, the 7-year-old Smokester
gelding is winless in seven races at Hollywood Park and has yet to
win in four starts at today's distance. He will have a new rider in
Felipe Martinez after being handled by Chance Rollins in his previous
three races.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Richard Haggerty and trained by Lewis Cenicola, Sharp Boi
-- a 5-year-old Sharp Victor gelding -- hasn't won since beating
$32,000 maidens on a yielding turf course at Golden Gate on Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Stonecoldfox, who was impressive in her only
previous sprint, and My Kai, who hasn't race since an easy win going
two furlongs at Santa Anita on April 18, lead a five-horse field in
the first at Hollywood Park. The 6 1/2-furlong optional claimer only
drew three other 2-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Julie Krone. The most successful female rider in
history has won seven times at Hollywood Park and began the final
three weeks of the season eighth in the jockey standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Gennadi Dorochenko. The former jockey turned trainer
has won with three of 120 starters in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Anima Mundi, Rich Musique,
Gold Scammer, Miss Boomtown and Partytime in the fifth, Rebel Rage,
Bold Mind and Abarouge in the sixth, Dancing Banner and Severo in the
seventh and singling Yearly Copy in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/53. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $21.80/$301.20. Total money bet: $358.</TE>

<HD>Allison Set for Fast Return Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A check of the calendar shows that, according to original estimates,
Jason Allison won't be back in the Kings' lineup for three to seven
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   A check of Allison's injured right knee this afternoon, however,
probably will allow him to play tonight against the Nashville
Predators at Staples Center, only five weeks and two days after he
suffered the injury Oct. 29 at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Allison, originally expected to be sidelined eight to 12 weeks
after a violent knee-on-knee collision with defenseman Andy Sutton of
the Atlanta Thrashers, is expected to be cleared to play after an
examination by team physician Ronald Kvitne about 90 minutes before
the opening faceoff.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm preparing to play," Allison said Wednesday after practice.</TE>
<TE>   All indications are that he will, his damaged knee heavily taped
and held in place by a brace he'll probably wear the rest of the
season, if not longer.</TE>
<TE>   Of the pregame examination, Coach Andy Murray said, "From what I
understand, it's just a final [look], like a pilot walks around a
plane before takeoff."</TE>
<TE>   After sitting out 15 games, Allison is eager to take wing.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you want to get back as soon as you can to help your
team win games," he said. "That was definitely a goal all along. With
our conference being so tight, it's even more important that you get
as many healthy games as you can from your top guys."</TE>
<TE>   Allison, 27, is the top guy for the Kings, their most valuable
player since the Oct. 24, 2001 trade that brought the prolific center
from the Boston Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Kings with 74 points in 73 games last season and was
their leader again this season with 11 points in nine games before
being injured.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't play if there's any risk," Murray said. "We're smart
enough to know the asset we've got. You can't have assurances on
anything in life, but you can go on the percentages and [his return]
is all based on what our medical people tell us."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, he said, have been told that if Allison can withstand
the pain and the swelling, he should be OK to play.</TE>
<TE>   "He feels real good," Murray said. "He's been real strong on the
puck [in practice]. He's able to battle in the battle drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a doctor, I'm just a coach ... but what I was told in our
meeting with our medical people [was that] if Jason played, there's
no greater chance that he would be hurt on that knee than he would if
he was hit on the other knee.</TE>
<TE>   "The stability is the same in both, and [the right] is not any
more susceptible because of his injury. It's at that point now."</TE>
<TE>   He'll be cleared if his right leg is 80% as strong as his left.</TE>
<TE>   "And he wouldn't be practicing if that wasn't the case," Murray
said. "He wouldn't have been allowed to do some of the things he's
been doing in practice."</TE>
<TE>   Allison has been skating for more than two weeks and resumed
practicing with his teammates Nov. 22, after they returned home from
an eight-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to take a game to really know, to really test
it and see if I'm ready," said Allison, who suggested Tuesday that if
his knee doesn't respond as well as expected he might have to sit out
again for a week or two. "I'm at the stage now where I feel I've got
to test it and try it in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do any kind of practice you want, but obviously guys in
practice aren't playing as hard, so we'll try it in a game. I'm
hoping it will feel good."</TE>

<HD>Medvedenko Injures Finger</HD>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Laker forward Slava Medvedenko tore the tendon off the tip of his
right pinkie finger Wednesday night and could be out as much as six
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   He was fitted with a splint that straightened his finger and today
is scheduled for X-rays and an examination by a hand specialist.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether he took a piece of bone off there, I don't know," trainer
Gary Vitti said.</LD>
<TE>   Typically, Vitti said, the finger must remain in a splint for
about six weeks or it will not straighten.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers hope to have power forward Samaki Walker practice today
and play Friday against Dallas. Walker, who has a strained lower
back, has been on the injured list since Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A couple hours after his air-balled free throws, Mark Madsen still
aghast, ESPN having a grand time with it, Madsen heard Shaquille
O'Neal, the noted free-throw specialist, weigh in.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Mark," he said. "You made history."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal laughed. Kobe Bryant, nearby, laughed. And Madsen, for the
first time since consecutive free throws brushed only the bottom of
the net on the way to the floor, managed to laugh too.</TE>
<TE>   As earnest a personality as any in the league, Madsen nodded and
smiled grimly on his way out of the locker room after Tuesday's game.
By early Wednesday night, before the Lakers played the Utah Jazz, he
was back at the free-throw line, knees bent, eyes steady, elbow
close, release just so.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what? I think there was an element of frustration,"
Madsen said. "I think there was an element of shock. But, like we say
on the team, it's not a failure, it's not a disaster. It's feedback.
I took some feedback last night."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the feedback was appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised at the disparaging remarks that were made by
[ESPN's] Tim Legler," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "Like, 'What's
he doing on the floor?' Making comments like that. I don't know how
he can cast that kind of comment on another player who's out there
working at the game."</TE>

<LD>Check Him Out, a multiple-stakes winner, has likely run his final
race.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by John Andreini, Zory Kuzyk and trainer Blane Schvaneveldt,
Check Him Out was scratched out of the third and final trial for the
$163,450 Southern California Derby on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Schvaneveldt said there was nothing wrong with the horse, but he
didn't want to take any risks because the horse's career is probably
over. Check Him Out has won nine of 18 and earned more than $418,000.</LD>

points to lead the 76ers over the Boston Celtics, 99-93, Wednesday
night at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman came into the game averaging 6.4 points and having scored
in double figures only once in eight games.</LD>
<TE>   "Having him back is nothing but a plus," said Allen Iverson, who
had 27 points. "It's more than his basketball skills. The most
important thing about having Derrick back is his leadership. He
understands what you have to do to win basketball games."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman's three-pointer capped a 9-0 run and gave Philadelphia a
97-92 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 103, Portland 88 -- Dirk Nowitzki had 26 points and 15
rebounds at Portland, Ore., and the Mavericks won their third in a

Blazers. Ruben Patterson, playing in his first game since prosecutors
decided not to pursue felony domestic abuse charges against him, had
four points.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 92, Denver 90 -- Chris Webber had 31 points and 11
rebounds, and Vlade Divac had 16 points and 14 rebounds to lead the
Kings at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, which had only eight players in uniform, has won four
in a row and 10 of 11.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 114, Seattle 111 -- Jamaal Tinsley made a three-pointer
with 10 seconds remaining in overtime to give the Pacers a five-point
lead at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton had a season-high 40 points.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 111, Chicago 101 -- Rookie Dajuan Wagner scored 29
points to help the host Cavaliers end a losing streak at 15 .</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Carlos Boozer and Ricky Davis each scored 26 points for the
Cavaliers, who won for the first time since a home-opening victory
over the Lakers on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 88, Detroit 83 -- Jerry Stackhouse and Michael Jordan
combined for 16 points in the fourth quarter in Stackhouse's first
regular-season appearance at Auburn Hills, Mich., since being traded
by the Pistons.</TE>

quarter, and each finished with 21 points.</TE>

play after injuring his right ankle in a loss to Boston Monday</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 89, Toronto 74 -- Baron Davis returned from a two-game
absence because of a back injury to score 18 points and the Hornets
improved to 10-0 at home.</TE>

<TE>   Phoenix 98, Memphis 85 -- Shawn Marion scored 13 of his

<LD>Sacramento King point guard Mike Bibby shot jumpers at Arco Arena for
the first time since Game 7 of the Western Conference finals this
week and hopes to return to playing next week.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby has not played this season after surgery on Oct. 12 for a
stress fracture in his right foot. X-rays Monday revealed he is
healing normally.</LD>
<LD>   "Hopefully I'm back next week," Bibby said. "It's the best news I
could have gotten. I'm almost healed."</LD>
<TE>   Bibby will be reexamined and said, "I'm the only one who knows how
the foot feels. I think I could be back in a week."</TE>

<TE>   Atlanta Hawk forward Glenn Robinson suffered a hyperextended left
knee in Tuesday's loss at New Jersey, but Robinson is vowing to play
in tonight's much-hyped reunion with the Milwaukee Bucks no matter
how much pain lingers.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'm going to play," Robinson told ESPN.com. "Something would
have to be broken for me not to play."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game is the first between the Hawks and Bucks since the
teams' summer trade that sent Robinson to Atlanta and triggered an
angry war of words between Robinson and Buck guard Ray Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Allen has since said that he hopes to find Robinson beforehand to
clear the air.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he's open to a reconciliation, Robinson said: "He should
be trying to patch things up. He's the one who started it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A group of police officers in Philadelphia is refusing to buy
tickets for the annual 76er law enforcement night to protest comments
made by guard Allen Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   The group, from the 8th District in Northeast Philadelphia, were
angered with Iverson's statement that he fears police in the city,
according to Wednesday's Philadelphia Inquirer. The game is Jan. 8
against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Raptor forward Jerome Williams will have arthroscopic
surgery if his left elbow fails to respond to aggressive treatment in
the next week, the team said. Williams has sat out the last three
games and is not on the team's four-game trip.... The Orlando Magic
activated forward Horace Grant from the injured list. Grant had been
sidelined since Oct. 29 because of a sore left knee.</TE>

<HD>Report: Webber's Father Took Gifts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father of former Michigan basketball star Chris Webber, now with
the NBA's Sacramento Kings, acknowledged before a federal grand jury
that he accepted gifts from a banned booster, his attorney said in a
court document.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time Mayce Webber Jr. acknowledged taking
anything from Eddie Martin, who pleaded guilty in May to money
laundering and admitted loaning $616,000 to four former Michigan
players, the Detroit News reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mayce Webber Jr., his sister-in-law, Charlene Johnson, and his son
were indicted in September on federal charges of conspiring to
obstruct justice and making a false statement to a grand jury. All
have pleaded not guilty. Each charge is punishable by up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</LD>
<TE>   Mayce Webber Jr. "acknowledged that Martin had given some gifts to
him, and Martin put a hotel bill on a charge card and was paid back,"
his attorney, Robert Morgan, said in a court motion filed last month.
The motion sought dismissal of the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   A booster paying for a room is a violation of NCAA rules.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Martin gave the Webber family $280,000 from 1988
to 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Chicago has ordered eight companies and three
people to pay more than $506 million to 46 male college athletes who
were secretly videotaped in locker rooms, restrooms and showers.</TE>
<TE>   The videotapes were sold through Internet sites advertising "hot
younger dudes."</TE>
<TE>   The decision grants each of 46 athletes $1 million in compensatory
damages and $10 million in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleged invasion of privacy, unlawful use of the
plaintiffs' images for monetary gain, and mail and wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the anonymous plaintiffs are past or present
athletes at Northwestern, Illinois, Illinois State, Eastern Illinois,
Indiana, Penn, Iowa State and Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   The judgment was entered against Franco Production, Franko
Productions, Rodco, Hidvidco, Hidvidco-Atlas Video Release, AMO
Video, Atlas Video, Gamport/Earthlink, and individuals Daniel Franco,
George Jachem and R.D. Couture. The court clerk's office said no
attorneys had appeared on behalf of the defendants since at least
2000.</TE>
<TE>   College Sports</TE>
<TE>   Universities could find it easier to comply with Title IX under
proposals that a federal commission began considering.</TE>
<TE>   Title IX, the law that requires gender equity in college
athletics, has greatly increased opportunities for women in sports in
the last 30 years. But critics say the law discriminates against men,
and schools complain that the government doesn't enforce the law
evenly and has failed to provide enough guidance on how to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in Philadelphia, the Commission on Opportunity in
Athletics began formulating recommendations for making the law
clearer and more flexible. The panel will vote on the recommendations
in January and submit them to Education Secretary Rod Paige, who has
final say on whether any are implemented.</TE>

<HD>Overtime Rule to Be Reviewed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NFL rule makers will decide in the spring whether to change the
sudden-death overtime format, two members of the league's competition
committee said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The panel, which makes recommendations on rules to owners, plans
to review the league's method of breaking ties, Tampa Bay General
Manager Rich McKay and Baltimore General Manager Ozzie Newsome said.
They are on the eight-member committee.</LD>
<LD>   The league has used sudden death, where the first team to score in
a 15-minute overtime period wins, during the regular season since
1974. Critics claim that the team that wins the coin- toss at the
beginning of the extra period and gets the ball first usually wins
the game.</LD>
<TE>   "If you win the coin toss, you have an upper hand," Buffalo
President Tom Donahoe said "The game shouldn't be decided by a coin
toss."</TE>
<TE>   The move to review the rule comes during a season that has had 20
overtime games -- one short of the record set in 1995 -- with four
weeks remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 2000 season, coin-toss winners have won 60% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A day after a different Warner made news, the St. Louis Rams'
quarterback was eager for the controversy to end.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Warner had called a radio station Tuesday to complain that
her husband had his broken hand X-rayed at her urging, not at the
insistence of Coach Mike Martz. The tape of her brief complaint, in
response to a suggestion that perhaps Kurt Warner had violated a
trust with Martz by holding out on the injury, has been replayed
endlessly in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "Martz had nothing to do with it," Brenda Warner said. "All week
long I said, 'Kurt, I'm a nurse, you should go get it X-rayed.' The
doctors never once said he should get an X-ray. [They] said, 'No,
it's only bruised.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Kurt Warner: "None of it's really an issue, so I'm not
worried about it and nothing I need to comment on." He will sit out
at least two weeks because of a hairline fracture at the knuckle of
the little finger.</TE>
<TE>   Warner refused comment on whether Martz had insisted on X-rays
Monday, asking at that point only to field questions about the hand.
Martz also had little to say on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver Bronco guard Steve Herndon and Coach Mike Shanahan
apologized to San Diego Charger defensive tackle Jamal Williams,
whose season was ended by a questionable hit by Herndon on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Williams dislocated his left ankle and underwent surgery Monday.
He was put on the injured reserve list Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan also called Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who
described Herndon's block as "disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   The play occurred in the third quarter of San Diego's 30-27
overtime win, when Williams was hit from behind by Herndon as
Williams chased tailback Clinton Portis on a screen pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Herman Moore announced his retirement, knowing he had
little chance of playing for the New York Giants and that the
injury-riddled team needed his roster space.</TE>
<TE>   It comes less than a month after the Giants signed the Detroit
Lions' leading career receiver. Moore, 33, said the retirement is
more a technicality, because he wants to play next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Supreme Court has cleared the way for construction
work to begin in earnest on the Arizona Cardinals' stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Parker, a spokesman for the Tourism and Sports Authority,
said a decision announced Wednesday also gives the go-ahead to Cactus
League baseball projects in Phoenix and Surprise, and construction of
a youth sports facility.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court without comment denied a petition for review of
an Aug. 27 decision in which a Court of Appeals panel ruled that the
law that created the TSA was constitutional. The decision upheld a
lower court's ruling from November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix developer John F. Long sued after land he offered as a
site for the stadium was rejected by the TSA board in favor of a
location in Tempe. The Tempe site was pulled when the Federal
Aviation Administration declared it a potential hazard for planes at
Phoenix's nearby Sky Harbor International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   TSA agreed to put the $355-million stadium in Glendale, next to an
arena the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes are building.</TE>

<LD>Jocelyn Thibault stopped 28 shots for his fourth shutout and Eric
Daze scored, as the Chicago Blackhawks ended the Ottawa Senators'
10-game unbeaten streak with a 1-0 victory Wednesday night at
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The Blackhawks and Thibault had to kill a major penalty to Ryan
VandenBussche late in the third period to earn the victory in their
first home game following a 1-6 trip.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 31st shutout of Thibault's career. Marian Hossa's
13-game point scoring streak for Ottawa ended.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas 5, Montreal 1 -- Jason Arnott scored three goals, two on
setups by Pierre Turgeon, and the Stars improved to 10-0-0-1 at home
in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Arnott had the fourth hat trick of his career and the first by a
Dallas player since Brett Hull scored four goals on March 21, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 3, New Jersey 2 -- Todd Bertuzzi got his second goal of
the game on a scramble in front 56 seconds into overtime to give the
Canucks a victory at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Carolina 2 -- Olli Jokinen scored two goals to lead the
Panthers at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Viktor Kozlov and Stephen Weiss also scored for Florida, which won
for only the second time in 11 games. Roberto Luongo made 31 saves
for the Panthers.</TE>

<HD>Sharks Move Quickly, Hire Wilson as Coach</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Mighty Duck coach Ron Wilson was hired Wednesday to coach the
San Jose Sharks, three days after the team fired Darryl Sutter and
his two assistants.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, fired by Washington in May after four mostly successful
seasons, coached the U.S. team in the 1998 Olympics, to the gold
medal in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, and twice in the world
championships.</LD>
<LD>   The Sharks moved quickly to fill their vacancy with a veteran
coach.</LD>
<TE>   Sutter, the winningest coach in franchise history, was fired
Sunday along with assistants Rich Preston and Lorne Molleken in a
surprising shakeup of a struggling team that aspires to be a Stanley
Cup contender.</TE>
<TE>   "Ron Wilson is an experienced NHL coach with a strong track record
in both the regular season and the playoffs," Shark General Manager
Dean Lombardi said in a release.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks are 9-12-2-2 and tied with Phoenix for last place in
the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Flyer left wing John LeClair had shoulder surgery and
is expected to be out 10 to 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   LeClair, 33, injured the shoulder after colliding with Pittsburgh
defenseman Marc Bergevin last week.</TE>
<TE>   A three-time 50-goal scorer, LeClair was plagued by back injuries
in recent years, twice having surgery. He had 25 goals and 26 assists
last season and played every game.</TE>
<TE>   LeClair has 11 goals and six assists this season.</TE>

<HD>All of These Columns Have Been Fit to Print</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Times ran an editorial calling on Tiger Woods to stay
home in April and skip the Masters, noting that a "tournament without
Mr. Woods would send a powerful message that discrimination isn't
good for the golfing business."</LD>
<LD>   Selena Roberts, a sportswriter for the New York Times, set the
stage for the editorial five days earlier last month with a stinging
column directed toward Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson:
"Listen, you old coot," Roberts wrote. "(Sorry if you loathe that
description). You cannot win this fight."</LD>
<LD>   In the weeks that have followed the New York Times' unusual
editorial, Roberts' blast and several other stories on the same
issue, we've now learned two more Times sportswriters, Harvey Araton
and Pulitzer Prize winner Dave Anderson, had columns killed because
they disagreed with the editorial page opinion of the newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   Here at the Los Angeles Times, of course, it's pretty obvious the
newspaper agrees with everything I have written for the last three
years because it has never stopped me from scribbling a single word.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously it'd be hard for anyone to argue that Sports Editor Bill
Dwyre isn't old, stingy, boring, a tennis honk and a whiny Notre Dame
fan who is stuffing his face with hot dogs when he's not playing golf
or Salma Hayek isn't a babe, but I presume this also means the
newspaper agrees 100% with my editorial position that most guests
appearing on "The Jerry Springer Show" have some connection to USC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GUESS you could also come to the conclusion that none of the
bosses around here read Page 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE DO have several editors here, however, who used to work for the
New York Times, and while that certainly makes them a little odd,
they seem to be fitting in all right. In fact our managing editor
used to work for the New York Times, and I can tell you from personal
experience he was nice enough once to say hello to me.</TE>
<TE>   Let's be honest, though, you've got to worry about people who come
from a newspaper with the credo: "All the news that's fit to print so
long as it agrees with our editorial position."</TE>
<TE>   Would you really want the Los Angeles Times to speak with one
voice? Now would that be Pucin's voice or Plaschke's? I know I'd have
to buy earmuffs.</TE>
<TE>   If the Los Angeles Times' editorial page starts gushing about the
Trojans, does that mean I have to do the same? (I'd want to do that
anyway, of course, but on my own.) By the way, the boss in charge of
the editorial pages is a graduate of USC, so it goes without saying
she must have gotten advanced education elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately there remains an air of independence here between the
editorial page and sports -- unless you're reading Newswire this
morning in this space, and this column has been killed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU PROBABLY don't even know this, or remember, but the Los
Angeles Times, like the New York Times, weighed in on the Augusta
flap on the editorial pages weeks ago, even working in a hackneyed
reference to a "sand trap" in the first paragraph.</TE>
<TE>   I agreed with every word of the editorial because there was no
mention of Tiger Woods, and really no compelling point to the
editorial, which is all this brouhaha about getting a rich woman into
a private Georgia club really deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods is only a golfer, and I don't really care what he has
to say beyond getting me 10 yards longer off the tee and farther away
from Dwyre. Tiger is a nice young man, very intelligent, quite witty,
and I find watching him on a Sunday afternoon with a five-stroke lead
trying to make it 10 over the other dullards on the golf tour about
as much viewing fun as I can have.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, though, the New York Times would like to make him
more than that, turn him into a crusader. And how odd is that -- the
newspaper then doing an abrupt about-face and shutting up its own
writers, who are paid and trained to be the crusaders?</TE>
<TE>   How long before Mr. Woods is being asked to fix the problems in
Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Come on, we've already made incredible strides at the Masters --
making it a commercial-free golf tournament this year -- which
admittedly will make it more difficult for me to communicate with the
wife while the tournament is on, but that's why I advocate every home
in America should have two TVs and the Lifetime channel.</TE>
<TE>   (I'm guessing by now -- one or two of my columns would have been
killed by the New York Times if I were working there.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE record, the Associated Press reported Wednesday that the
New York Times is saying now the sports columns were not killed
because they disagreed with the newspaper's editorial page, but
because they failed to meet newsroom standards.</TE>
<TE>   Just an off day, the newspaper would like you to believe, for the
Pulitzer Prize winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WILL THE Chargers sell out when they move here?</TE>
<TE>   For the week of Nov. 25-Dec. 1, the No. 1-rated TV show in the Los
Angeles area was a Monday night football game (Eagles-49ers). The No.
2 show was the USC-Notre Dame game. No. 3 was a Sunday morning NFL
game on Fox. "CSI" and "The Simpsons" tied for fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HOPE it doesn't get to the point where I have to start traveling
with the Lakers now to keep the heat on Coach Phil Jackson. I'd still
like to think that's Jeanie's job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from George:</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when you were spending a lot of time with Eric Karros
and he was hitting and really doing well. What happened?"</TE>
<TE>   I began spending time with the Angels.</TE>

<HD>Blatter Cleared by Prosecutors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the president of FIFA, was cleared of
financial mismanagement accusations Wednesday when public prosecutors
in Zurich, Switzerland, closed their investigation and heaped scorn
on those who had filed the complaints almost seven months ago.</LD>
<LD>   "The complainants ... had accused Joseph Blatter of actions which
they themselves had collectively approved," the prosecutor's office
said in a prepared statement.</LD>
<LD>   "In this regard, the complaint was not only reprehensible, which
is self-evident under the given circumstances, but also bordering on
false accusation."</LD>
<TE>   The complaint was filed on May 13 by 11 members of FIFA's 24-man
executive committee and was based in part on a report by FIFA's
then-general secretary, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, who claimed that
Blatter had made unauthorized payments and had covered up the extent
of financial losses suffered in the collapse of FIFA's marketing
partner.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter contended that the charges were part of an election
campaign aimed at ousting him as president of world soccer's
governing body. He was subsequently elected to a second four-year
term.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope, for the good of the game and all those who love and serve
it, that we will never again see such a campaign, which was unjust
and based purely upon slander and groundless complaints," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole matter has been a dirty game that has caused
unnecessary and untold damage to the image of football, the game's
world governing body and not least that of its president."</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-Canada Set</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's national team will open its 2003 season against
Canada in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Jan. 18, U.S. Soccer announced.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan Decision</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Bayer Leverkusen said they will make a decision next
week on whether to recall U.S. World Cup forward Landon Donovan, who
has played on loan for the last two seasons with Major League
Soccer's San Jose Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, 20, is under contract with Leverkusen until 2007 and the
German Bundesliga club has the option of bringing him back into its
fold, selling him to another team or extending the loan agreement
with MLS.</TE>
<TE>   "The final decision on his future will come next week," said Ilja
Kaenzig, Leverkusen's financial manager. "We are in good talks with
the MLS. We are going to find a solution that everyone can live
with."</TE>
<TE>   Sukur Signs</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent Turkish World Cup striker Hakan Sukur, who has scored
37 goals in 80 games for his national team, was signed by the
Blackburn Rovers of the English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   The move reunited Sukur, 31, with Blackburn Coach Graeme Souness,
his former coach at Galatasaray in the Turkish league, and also with
U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who also played for Souness at
Galatasaray.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Security</TE>
<TE>   Concerns over potential terrorist acts have prompted the Israeli
soccer federation to announce that at least two and possibly all four
of Israel's "home" games in qualifying for the 2004 European
Championship will be played in England.</TE>
<TE>   Citing security reasons, UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, had
earlier barred Israel from hosting international matches and ordered
the Israeli federation to select an alternate site for its games
against Cyprus, France, Malta and Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   Gavri Levi, the federation chairman, said Israel had reached
agreement to use the Vicarage Road ground of English first division
team Watford. Israel will play there against European champion France
on April 2 and Cyprus on April 30.</TE>
<TE>   The site for the other two "home" matches has yet to be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, both the Israeli federation and Italian police denied a
report in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper claiming that Italian
authorities had foiled an alleged Al Qaeda plot to harm the Israeli
team when it played Malta in Malta on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Coach Avraham Grant blasted the report, saying his country
already finds it difficult to arrange matches.</TE>
<TE>   "We are no longer sought after as opponents by other national
teams," he said. "Nobody is in any hurry to host us. I would go as
far as to say that they really don't want us. I expect that after the
publication of this story it will be even worse."</TE>

<HD>Acker Has Fullerton's Number</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Rob Fernas; Paul McLeod</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Acker found a new jersey number along with his shooting touch
Wednesday night to help rebounding-challenged Pepperdine turn back
Cal State Fullerton, 90-87, in front of 1,804 at Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   Acker, a reserve forward, switched to No. 15 after leaving his
regular No. 3 jersey at home. The 6-foot-5 sophomore responded with a
breakout game, scoring 19 points, including two free throws with 16.8
seconds for an 89-85 lead.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll probably change to No. 15," Acker said with a laugh.
"They'll probably make me change it."</LD>
<TE>   Before the game, Acker was averaging two points and had made only
three of 14 shots. He was perfect Wednesday, making all six of his
shots from the field, including three three-point baskets, and all
four of his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the guy we've been seeing in practice every day,"
Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said. "He came out and played the way
we know he can play. He'll have a lot of games like that."</TE>
<TE>   Acker's effort was needed on a night the Waves (2-2) were
outrebounded, 38-23. Fullerton (1-3) had an 18-2 edge in offensive
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a very serious problem," said Westphal, whose team
is short-handed on the front line because center Will Kimble has a
heart condition and forward Glen McGowan is still recovering from
knee surgery. "I'm glad we won the game, that's about all I can say."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Waves lost the battle of the boards, they prevailed
thanks to a winning touch. Pepperdine made 33 of 54 shots (61.1%),
among them 10 of 18 three-pointers. Fullerton shot 50% but missed 17
of 22 three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton guard Ralphy Holmes led all scorers with 29 points and
helped the Titans rally from an 11-point halftime deficit. Two free
throws by center Pape Sow pulled Fullerton within 87-85 with 1:22 to
play, but the Titans missed two shots that would have tied the score
before Pepperdine made three of four free throws in the last 17
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jimmy Miggins and center Boomer Brazzle each scored 20
points for the Waves.</TE>
<TE>   -- Rob Fernas</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine 81, Loyola Marymount 66 -- After being lectured in
private before practice Tuesday by Coach Pat Douglass to stay out of
foul trouble, center Adam Parada had 28 points and seven rebounds for
the Anteaters (2-2) in a victory at Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot junior also had two assists and two blocked shots in 32
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a handful, he's really improved," Loyola Marymount Coach
Steve Aggers said. "We tried to double down on him and he still
handled it."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Brandon Worthy scored 15 points off the bench and forward
Keith Kincade scored 11 for Loyola (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   With Irvine leading by three in the second half, Parada, who had
fouled out of Irvine's previous two games, started a 12-2 run with a
turnaround eight-foot jumper off an inbounds pass. He was fouled and
sank the free throw, giving Irvine a 47-41 lead with 13 minutes 32
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   His blocked shot contributed to a 67-49 lead and he left the game
with 2:50 remaining after his dunk put the Anteaters ahead, 74-51.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Harris had 14 points and seven rebounds, and Stanislav
Zuzak had 10 points for Irvine, which has won its last four games
against the Lions.</TE>

<HD>Tiger Is Host With the Most</HD>
<DH>Woods and 15 other top players compete at Sherwood for
$1-million first prize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is it called when eight of the top 10 players in the world show
up to play?</LD>
<LD>   Normally, it's a major championship, but starting today it's
something entirely different. The $3.8-million Target World Challenge
might be only an off-season, 72-hole exhibition, but it also has an
impressive field and an equally impressive purse.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the top two ranked golfers, lead
the 16-player field at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, where
first place is worth $1 million and last place is worth $130,000.</LD>
<TE>   "It has been great to have events like this so we don't have to
travel and play overseas," Woods said. "We can stay right here and
play. For me, it's great coming back to Southern California, where I
was born and raised."</TE>
<TE>   Third-ranked Ernie Els and fourth-ranked Sergio Garcia are the
only players in the top 10 who are not here. Els, who won last week
in South Africa, is hosting his own tournament next week. Garcia went
on a safari to rest after a hectic schedule that began with the Tour
Championship, then the Volvo Masters and tournaments in Singapore,
Japan and South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the field at Sherwood: Retief Goosen, David Toms,
Vijay Singh, Padraig Harrington, Davis Love III, Colin Montgomerie,
Chris DiMarco, Jim Furyk, Nick Price, Bernhard Langer, Michael
Campbell, Bob Estes, Rich Beem and Mark O'Meara.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, Langer, Beem and O'Meara received special invitations
to play. The others qualified as a result of their ranking and
accepted invitations.</TE>
<TE>   The event, hosted by Woods, is the second-richest off-season
tournament, second only to the $4.06-million Nedbank Golf Challenge,
which Els won a week ago, collecting $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he takes his tournament more seriously than anyone
else.</TE>
<TE>   "Because whatever I win, I donate to my foundation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Woods gave his winner's share of $1 million to the
Tiger Woods Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus designed the 7,025-yard layout at Sherwood, where
the Shark Shootout was staged for 12 years. This is the third year
Woods' tournament has been at Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to build a base and stay here for a while," Woods said.</TE>

<HD>No Cougar Rematch for Injured Perry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is not the game Bruin receiver Tab Perry wanted to miss. Not
after he spent five days in a Pullman, Wash., hospital last year with
broken ribs and a punctured lung.</LD>
<LD>   Perry was injured by a hit from Washington State cornerback Marcus
Trufant in UCLA's 20-14 loss to Washington State. Cougar Coach Mike
Price and several players visited him in the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "They went out of their way to see me," said Perry, who has a high
ankle sprain. "It was nice. But I didn't like getting hurt. It's
unfortunate. I wanted to play in this game real bad."</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot-2 junior leads the Bruins with an average of 19.9 yards
per catch and is third with 35 receptions. His absence has forced
Craig Bragg to move from split end to flanker and will thrust
freshman Junior Taylor into the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Taylor is ready, he's been impressive," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Perry might be felt as much on special teams as on
offense. He is second in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 25.0 kick
return average.</TE>
<TE>   The other kick returner, freshman Jason Harrison, has not
practiced because of a concussion and is questionable. Tailback Tyler
Ebell and cornerbacks Matt Clark and Ricky Manning could return kicks
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Seidman is one of three finalists for the Mackey Award, given
to college football's top tight end. Kellen Winslow Jr. of Miami and
Dallas Clark of Iowa are the others.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman, the only Bruin invited to the Senior Bowl, is third in
the nation with 563 receiving yards. His 37 receptions are seven
fewer than the school season record set by Paul Bergmann in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be recognized like this," Seidman said. "There are a
lot of great tight ends this year, so I'm definitely honored."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Matt Ware, a freshman All-American last season, hasn't
exactly been the victim of a sophomore jinx, but he admits to not
playing up to expectations. He has only one interception after having
five last year.</TE>
<TE>   He has had to leave several games because of injuries ranging from
a sprained ankle to a pulled hamstring to bruised ribs.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming out a lot makes it hard to get into a rhythm," he said. "I
need to be more consistent, that's the main thing."</TE>
<TE>   Ware began the season at free safety and moved to cornerback --
where he started every game last year -- after two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be a corner for the rest of my career," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve receivers Jon Dubravac (broken toes) and Garrett Lepisto
(flu) returned to practice Wednesday and will play.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison was restricted to light drills and defensive end Mat Ball
did not practice because of concussions. Harrison is questionable and
Ball is expected to play.</TE>

<HD>Atlantic 10 Official: Fans Didn't Interfere With USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC and the Atlantic 10 Conference have essentially agreed to
disagree over the Trojans' controversial 73-71 overtime loss at Rhode
Island on Nov. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Still maintaining that a technical foul should have been called on
the host Rams after team members, cheerleaders and fans rushed the
court with 2.2 seconds remaining on the game clock, USC is forced to
accept the defeat.</LD>
<LD>   "I received a letter today from the A-10 commissioner [Linda
Bruno] saying that she basically admitted that there were people on
the court," USC senior associate athletic director Daryl Gross said
Wednesday. "But in her opinion, she felt the refs ad-libbed the whole
situation and kept play moving, that the people on the court didn't
interfere with the flow of the game.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't agree, but that's where it is. That's where it ends.
There is no appeal process."</TE>
<TE>   Gross said USC's frustrations are especially justified after
pleading the Trojans' case to Pacific 10 Conference officials this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that a technical foul should have been called," Gross
said, which would have given the Trojans two free throws and
possession. "But once the refs leave the court, the game's over.</TE>
<TE>   "Our conference would have handled it differently, maybe a
reprimand for the officials."</TE>

<HD>Palmer Is Unitas Winner</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The postseason awards cavalcade continued Wednesday for USC
quarterback Carson Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer was selected as the winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm
award, presented annually to the nation's top senior quarterback.
Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr called Palmer to deliver the
news.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer is the second USC player to win the Unitas award, joining
1988 winner Rodney Peete. Miami's Ken Dorsey, Marshall's Byron
Leftwich, Louisville's Dave Ragone and Iowa State's Seneca Wallace
were other finalists.</LD>
<TE>   "I obviously never saw Unitas play, but everybody knows the name.
He's the greatest that ever played," said Palmer, who passed for
3,639 yards and 32 touchdowns this season. "To win an award named
after him is such an honor."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was named to an All-American team and selected Pacific 10
Conference offensive co-player of the year Monday. He also is a
finalist for the Davey O'Brien (top quarterback) and Walter Camp (top
player) awards and is regarded as a leading contender for the Heisman
Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   The O'Brien, Camp, Unitas and Heisman awards will be presented
next week during ceremonies at Orlando, Fla., Louisville, Ky., and
New York. Palmer and safety Troy Polamalu, a finalist for the Thorpe
Award, will be on the road with family and USC representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so crazy the past couple days and it's going to get
crazier," Palmer said. "We'll be flying from here to there. I have no
idea what to expect. I'm sure it's going to be fun, but hope it's not
too overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll and his staff continued recruiting efforts and
will reconvene Friday for the first of three Trojan practices....
Offensive coordinator Norm Chow, who met with Utah Athletic Director
Chris Hill on Monday, was scheduled to be in Hawaii on Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>USC blew a 10-point second-half lead but recovered in the final
minute to edge Pepperdine, 64-63, before 512 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The win continued the unique hold USC has over Pepperdine. The
teams have now met 15 times, and the Trojans have won every game.</LD>
<LD>   Aisha Hollans finished with 19 points and Ebony Hoffman had 18
points and 15 rebounds for USC (4-2). But the heroine for the Trojans
was Jessica Cheeks (15 points), who twice drove the baseline for
layups in the final minute, including the game-winning basket with
16.8 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   The Waves (2-3), who got 18 points from Shandrika Lee and 15
points from Damaris Hinojosa, took three shots in the final seconds
but could not score.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the 400th career victory for USC's Chris Gobrecht, but
few have come harder in her 24 years of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   "We made [the win] way harder than we should have," Gobrecht said.
"But Pepperdine played very hard and seemed to own every loose ball.
We're thankful to get out of here with a win."</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Terry</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Tennessee 60, Louisiana Tech 35 -- Gwen Jackson and Tasha
Butts had 12 points apiece as the Lady Vols (6-1) held the Techsters
(2-2) to a program-low point total.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Tech's previous low was 44 points against Tennessee
during the 1986-87 season.</TE>
<TE>   It was the home debut for Kurt Budke, who replaced Leon Barmore as
the Techsters' coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Ratay scored 21 points as No. 9 Notre Dame (3-0) prevailed,
74-68, over host Valparaiso (2-4) despite not making a field goal in
the final 4:52.... No. 10 Texas Tech's Jia Perkins had a career-high
41 points and Plenette Pierson a career-best 31 to lead the Red
Raiders (3-1) past Creighton (2-2), 98-70, at Lubbock, Texas.... Jess
Brungo and Tanisha Wright scored 25 points apiece, and No. 11 Penn
State Coach Rene Portland got her 600th victory as the Nittany Lions
(5-1) beat Maryland (3-2), 101-74, at State College, Pa. She is the
seventh NCAA Division I coach to reach the milestone.... Stacy
Stephens had 17 points for No. 17 Texas (2-1), which beat Southwest
Texas State (1-4), 98-36, at Austin, Texas.... LaToya Thomas had 25
points as No. 20 Mississippi State (5-1) beat Memphis (4-1), 79-63,
at Memphis, Tenn.... Jocelyn Penn tied a school record with 50 points

<HD>'A Top Leader' of Group Suspected in Bali Bombing Is
Arrested</HD>
<DH>Man is believed to be operations chief of Southeast Asian
network that allegedly carried out deadly terrorist attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall and Sari Sudarsono</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The suspected operations chief of the shadowy Southeast Asian
terrorist network that is believed to have carried out the deadly
Bali bombing in October has been arrested in central Java, police
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ali Gufron, 42, also known as Mukhlas, was seized from a supposed
safe house in the town of Solo shortly before midnight Tuesday along
with his wife and six other people, authorities said. All of those
detained are believed to have links to the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist
organization.</LD>
<LD>   Answering media questions here in the Indonesian capital late
Wednesday, the national chief of detectives, Erwin Mappaseng, said
Gufron had been wanted in connection with a series of terrorist
bombings in the region, including the Oct. 12 attack that killed 191
people -- most of them foreigners -- on the idyllic tourist island of
Bali. Gufron had also been sought by authorities for terror-related
activities in Malaysia and Singapore.</LD>
<TE>   "He is a top leader," Mappaseng told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   A Belgian-made rifle, 12 rounds of ammunition and what police
called "some documents about jihad" were also seized, according to
Mappaseng.</TE>
<TE>   Gufron's arrest marks the latest in a series of blows to the
terrorist group in the wake of the Bali attack. In recent weeks,
police have arrested the suspected ringleader of the bombing plot and
a key accomplice whose explosives-laden car was detonated outside one
of the nightclubs hit in the attack. Both have confessed involvement
in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The accomplice, known as Amrozi, is Gufron's younger brother. Two
other Gufron brothers are also wanted by police, one of them as the
possible triggerman who detonated a car bomb used in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference last week, a senior police officer named
Gufron as the man authorities believed had assumed operational
control of Jemaah Islamiah shortly after the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   The militant group, which has been active in Malaysia, Singapore
and the Philippines as well as Indonesia, nurtures the vision of
carving an independent Muslim caliphate out of Southeast Asia. One of
its top leaders, a cleric named Riduan Isamuddin, also known as
Hambali, is considered the most widely sought terrorist in the
Southeast Asian region. He is said to maintain close ties with other
terrorist groups in the region and with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe Hambali has gone into hiding in recent weeks and
relinquished operational control of the organization to Gufron.
"After Hambali escaped, Mukhlas took over his position," Mappaseng
said, using Gufron's alias.</TE>
<TE>   Gufron was born in the eastern Javan village of Tenggulun, was
educated in Islamic schools and -- like many militant Muslims in the
region -- learned how to use weapons while fighting the Soviets in
Afghanistan in the 1980s. He was known to teach a radical brand of
Islam and instilled those views in others, including his younger
brothers, police said.</TE>

<HD>Powell Promises More U.S. Aid</HD>
<DH>Colombia will get increased support to fight its civil war,
the secretary of State announces during his first official visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials Wednesday promised Colombia increased support to fight
its civil war, as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell completed a trip
intended to demonstrate a deepening commitment to the troubled Andean
country.</LD>
<LD>   Following meetings with President Alvaro Uribe and senior Cabinet
members, Powell and other U.S. officials said they would seek
increases in aid as the Colombians had requested.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a partnership that works, and a partnership that we must
continue to make an investment in," Powell said.</LD>
<TE>   Anne W. Patterson, U.S. ambassador to Colombia, said U.S.
officials are searching for ways to step up aid "across a broad range
of areas," including intelligence support, military spare parts and
maintenance, and help in eradicating the coca crop. Officials would
also like to increase economic assistance, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has provided $1.8 billion since fiscal 2000 to
help Colombia in its war against two leftist guerrilla groups and
right-wing paramilitaries, Powell said. The U.S. spent $411 million
in fiscal 2002, and the administration has sought $537 million for
this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The latest pledge of assistance is precisely what had been sought
by Uribe, who has stepped up the war since his landslide election in
May. Colombian officials have lamented privately that their cause was
falling off Washington's radar screen since last year's terrorist
attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the deepening U.S. commitment also raises difficult
issues. Human rights advocates worry that Uribe could go too far in
the emergency steps he has taken to destroy rebel and paramilitary
groups. And some members of Congress worry that the 38-year-old civil
war could be a Vietnam-like morass for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson told reporters that the clearest sign of success is the
increasing destruction of the coca crop. She said that U.S.-trained
Colombian troops have destroyed about 300,000 acres of coca fields
this year, up from 232,000 acres last year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted that despite domestic opposition to the
eradication program, Uribe has asked for more U.S. helicopters. The
United States has provided 71 helicopters for the Colombian military
and another 61 for the police.</TE>
<TE>   Powell promised that early next year, the United States would
resume its program of aerial intelligence that enables Colombian and
Peruvian air forces to track and intercept aircraft carrying drug
cargoes out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been reworking the program since April 2001,
when a Peruvian air force fighter plane mistakenly shot down a
private plane, killing an American missionary and her infant
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombians have been eager for resumption of the program,
which they consider a major success.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson said the U.S. military is to begin training a Colombian
brigade to protect a major oil pipeline from constant rebel attacks.
Thirty-three U.S. Special Forces troops and others have arrived in
the Arauca region of northeastern Colombia to begin the training;
about 60 more are expected by the beginning of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this visible new commitment, Powell noted there are limits
to how much the U.S. can provide Colombians, especially when the
American defense budget is already on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Though "I would like to be able to get a lot more funding for Plan
Colombia, there are practical limits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia has been the third largest recipient of U.S. aid, after
Israel and Egypt. The civil war is by far the bloodiest conflict in
the Western Hemisphere, claiming about 3,500 lives a year in a
country of 39 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been trying to achieve a delicate
balance in its Colombia policy. While U.S. officials enthusiastically
support Uribe's efforts to step up the war, they are also wary that
some in the Colombian government could go too far and violate human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress have voiced reservations that Uribe, not
long ago considered a member of the right-wing fringe, may overstep
proper bounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Human rights have to be in the forefront of all our activities,"
Powell said Tuesday. On his first official trip to Colombia, Powell
also met with Colombian civic groups and laid a wreath at a police
counter-narcotics facility.</TE>
<TE>   Security was tight during the visit. Armed troops stood guard
around the buildings Powell visited, and U.S.-built Black Hawk
helicopters flew overhead. Although the war has been waged mostly in
the countryside, rebels have increasingly attacked the cities, and
they fired mortars during Uribe's inauguration ceremony in August.</TE>

and causing oil-filled eucalyptus trees to burst, fire service
spokesman John Winter said.</LD>
<TE>   "We've really got to attribute these fires to some sort of human
action ... whether that be deliberate or accidental," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New South Wales state political leader Bob Carr said at least one
of the fires might have been sparked by a cigarette butt thrown from
a car window. Other blazes, he said, may have been deliberately
started.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, 3,000 firefighters were being deployed to battle the
blazes, and dozens of water-bombing helicopters and planes were
taking to the air.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures Wednesday reached 97 degrees in western Sydney, and
the city of 4 million is experiencing one of the worst droughts in

<HD>Send More Inspectors, White House Urges U.N.</HD>
<DH>The agency is asked to be more aggressive in Iraqi searches
by a Bush administration skeptical of teams' ability to find banned
weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang and Maggie Farley</AU>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is urging the United Nations to conduct more
aggressive weapons searches in Iraq, saying more inspectors should be
deployed to conduct multiple, simultaneous site checks, the White
House said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The White House is convinced that Iraq retains weapons of mass
destruction but is skeptical that the inspectors can find them. So
while the administration is pushing for more assertive inspections,
it is also dismissing any suggestion that Iraq's early cooperation
with U.N. monitors means that Baghdad has indeed disarmed and war
will be averted.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice met with
chief weapons inspector Hans Blix at the U.N. and urged him to
increase the number of inspectors and carry out several surprise
searches at the same time to speed the process and to make it more
difficult for Iraq to thwart the operations.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to make certain that they are aggressive enough to be
able to ascertain the facts in the face of an adversary who in the
past did everything in his power to hide the facts," White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The number of inspectors will increase from 17 to 100 by
Christmas, with more monitors to be trained in January, Blix said.
But Washington has asked that the training sessions be speeded up.
Blix said that Rice offered plenty of "recommendations and advice on
how to proceed" but that he didn't interpret it as undue pressure. "I
know what my job is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The push to step up the inspections' pace occurred as U.N. teams
finished their first week's work in Iraq without incident and the
Sunday deadline approached for Baghdad to submit an inventory of its
weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer characterized Dec. 8, the deadline for Iraq's report, as
the beginning of a new phase in Washington's showdown with Baghdad.
The report will be delivered to the Security Council members,
including the United States, on Sunday night or Monday morning, U.N.
officials said. But it will take some time to determine whether the
information in the report -- or lack of it -- will clearly show that
Iraq is disarming or dissembling.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials said that they expect the report to be thousands of
pages long, with summaries in English and supporting documents in
Arabic, and that it would take "days" to translate and analyze it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. administration is also gearing up for an in-depth review
and cross-check with its own intelligence about what weapons Baghdad
may still hold. If the U.S. believes Iraq's declaration to be
patently false, diplomats may hand their counter-evidence to the
weapons inspectors to discreetly verify it, or they may go straight
to the Security Council to present it as proof of a "material breach"
of Resolution 1441.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, weapons experts visited two sites known to have produced
banned weapons in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Al Tuwaitha, south of Baghdad, was associated with Iraq's nuclear
program. Research reactors and all significant nuclear-related
installations were destroyed during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and
the rest dismantled later.</TE>
<TE>   Biological and chemical experts, meanwhile, inspected the
sprawling Al Muthanna complex, northwest of Baghdad, the original
home of Iraq's biological weapons program. The site was heavily
bombed in 1991, and inspectors viewed the rusting hulls of old
fermenters and tanks.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. team leader Dimitri Perricos said the inspectors had found
mustard gas at the site -- as expected -- because U.N. monitors left
it there during the last inspections in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   While Iraqi authorities have cooperated with the inspections, even
during a search for documents in one of President Saddam Hussein's
carefully guarded presidential palaces, a senior Iraqi official
allowed a flicker of anger to show Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said the teams' "work is to
spy, to serve the CIA and Mossad," the Israeli intelligence service,
the Associated Press reported from Baghdad. In 1998, some members of
the inspection teams said the U.N. mission was being used by
intelligence agencies. The teams' efforts unraveled as Hussein
charged them with espionage and blocked access to inspection sites.
Ultimately, the inspectors pulled out of Baghdad the day before a
U.S.-British bombing strike.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq depends on a clean bill of health from inspectors not only to
avoid war but also to end a decade of punitive sanctions implemented
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. At U.N. headquarters in New
York on Wednesday, the Security Council voted to extend the
humanitarian "oil for food" program for six more months, but to
review a list of banned import items within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   The extension of the program is usually routine, but this time,
the U.S. wanted to add new items to the list it claimed could be used
for military purposes and threatened to block the rollover. Russia
countered by saying it wanted to take items off the list, such as
Russian-made trucks. The 15-member council avoided a split in its
unity on Iraq by deciding to extend the program and hold discussions
on the "goods review list."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOMBASA, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Police were questioning a Kenyan man who said he sold the vehicle
used in a suicide attack at a hotel frequented by Israelis,
investigators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Police also detained two other men, based on witness reports that
they were near the spot where two missiles were launched last
Thursday, narrowly missing an airliner carrying tourists back to Tel
Aviv, Deputy Police Commissioner William Langat said.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the British Embassy in Nairobi closed its offices until
further notice because of a "specific threat," spokesman Mark Norton
said.</LD>
<TE>   Langat said Wednesday that none of those detained in connection
with last week's attacks -- including 10 taken into custody from a
Somali fishing boat -- was a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel blast and resulting fire killed 10 Kenyans, three
Israelis and three bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The seller of the car used in the blast told police he sold the
green Mitsubishi Pajero on Nov. 15 to "two Arab-looking young men"
who traded in a Toyota Corolla.</TE>

<HD>Israel Kills Palestinian Militant</HD>
<DH>Mustafa Sabah, blamed in three lethal tank bombings, dies
in an army strike in Gaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel on Wednesday killed a Palestinian militant it blamed for
making powerful bombs that blew up three mammoth battle tanks this
year, leaving seven soldiers dead and sending shock waves through the
Israeli military establishment.</LD>
<LD>   The strike on 35-year-old Mustafa Sabah, who was affiliated with a
relatively small Palestinian militant group, was swift and decisively
lethal. Israeli assault helicopters swooped over a Palestinian
Authority compound in Gaza City where Sabah worked as a part-time
guard and destroyed the concrete-block guardhouse with three missiles
fired in rapid succession, onlookers said.</LD>
<LD>   Militant groups quickly vowed vengeance for the killing. "We
promise our martyr that we will avenge every drop of his blood, and
soon," said a statement issued by a coalition of groups including
Sabah's Palestinian Popular Resistance Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Since the earliest days of the 26-month-old conflict, Israel has
carried out dozens of targeted killings of Palestinian militant
leaders it held responsible for orchestrating attacks against
Israelis. Israel rarely makes a direct public acknowledgment of
having carried out such attacks, but military officials made no
attempt to hide their satisfaction over having eliminated Sabah.</TE>
<TE>   He was considered a master bomb maker -- or, in the common jargon
of the Israeli army and Palestinian militant groups, a highly
competent "engineer." Soon after the strike, the military spokesman's
office released a list of attacks for which Sabah was blamed -- chief
among them three roadside bombings that had blown up three Merkava
tanks this year.</TE>
<TE>   Three Israeli soldiers were killed when a 170-pound bomb exploded
underneath a Merkava on Feb. 14; another three soldiers of the tank
crew died and two were injured by a similar device planted on a
nearby Gaza road a month later, on March 14. Another Israeli soldier
was killed and three were injured in a third Merkava blast Sept. 5,
not far from the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military sources also said Sabah had outfitted and
dispatched at least one would-be suicide bomber, whose target was an
Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip. The behemoth Merkava battle
tanks, designed to be highly resistant even to extremely powerful
explosives planted directly in their path, hold a place of pride in
Israel's military arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   During Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon, there was
consternation in Israeli military circles when the guerrilla group
Hezbollah managed to craft roadside bombs capable of damaging or
destroying Merkavas. The tanks were modified and their armor
strengthened in response to that campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent success of the attacks attributed to Sabah, all of
them on Gaza roads used almost exclusively by Israeli armored
vehicles, was another shock to Israel, because Palestinian militant
groups aren't viewed as being as technically proficient as Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   Israel sent in at least three attack helicopters to participate in
the daylight raid, witnesses said. Such attacks had become relatively
rare in Gaza after a massive bomb dropped on a Hamas leader's
apartment building this year killed more than a dozen other people,
including women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Sabah's whereabouts would probably have been pinpointed by the
large network of informers and collaborators Israel has cultivated in
the West Bank and Gaza, or through Israeli electronic surveillance of
militants' conversations by radio and mobile telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, two wanted Palestinian men, both of them from the
militant group Islamic Jihad, died in an early morning gun battle
after Israeli soldiers tracked them to a cave hide-out near the West
Bank town of Hebron. The army said the men opened fire at soldiers
who tried to arrest them. Afterward, the army blew up the cave to
prevent it from being used for refuge again.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Losing Popularity in World</HD>
<DH>While a strong reserve of goodwill remains, a poll of
38,000 finds a growing number don't like America's policies or its
people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>America's global image has deteriorated sharply in the last two
years, and U.S. citizens' views on key world issues differ markedly
from public attitudes in much of the rest of the world, a landmark
study of public opinion in 44 nations concludes.</LD>
<LD>   While a strong reserve of goodwill toward the United States
remains, and majorities in 35 countries say they support the U.S.-led
war on terrorism, the percentage of people reporting a favorable
opinion of the United States has fallen in 20 of 27 nations where
benchmark data are available, according to the study released
Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-American sentiment in most Muslim nations is profound, with
the exception of Uzbekistan. But the study revealed growing
discontent, especially in the nations that know America best, over
the United States' ideas of democracy, its business practices, its
perceived unilateralism and policies that are seen as increasing the
global gap between rich and poor.</LD>
<TE>   "Relatively few Americans have any idea of how critically we are
seen around the world and the ways we're criticized, and what we're
criticized for," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew center, who
delivered the report to the White House on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The study arrives at a moment when President Bush is dispatching
diplomats around the world to try to build "a coalition of the
willing" to change the Iraqi regime, by force if necessary. The Pew
study finds the administration facing profound public opinion
problems in Turkey and Pakistan, two key allies in the wars on
terrorism and, potentially, Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defense officials have been visiting Turkey this week,
courting its help in any war against Iraq, but the poll found that
83% of Turks are opposed to using their bases to strike its neighbor.
In addition, a majority believe that a U.S. attack on Iraq would be
prompted not by security concerns but part of a broader American war
on unfriendly Muslim countries.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Wednesday brushed off a question about the findings on
Turkey and Pakistan, saying he doesn't run his government based on
polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the message that we fight not a religion, but a group of
fanatics which have hijacked a religion, is getting through," he
said. "I understand the propaganda machines are cranked up in the
international community that paints our country in a bad light.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do everything we can to remind people that we've never been
a nation of conquerors; we're a nation of liberators," Bush added.
"And I would ask the skeptics to look at Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   But the poll found that Americans' concerns diverge from those in
much of the rest of the world. While Americans tend to name nuclear
weapons as the biggest world problem, citizens of most other nations
cite AIDS and other infectious diseases, pollution and environmental
problems, ethnic and religious strife, and the gap between rich and
poor. Crime and political corruption were cited more widely than
terrorism as "very big" problems.</TE>
<TE>   Hunger remains a fundamental problem, with 44% of Mexicans, 50% of
Russians and 86% of Angolans polled in the capital, Luanda, and
surrounding areas saying they had not had enough money to buy
necessary food for their families in the last year. Poor-quality
drinking water was a major concern across the developing world, as
was lack of health care.</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million Pew study is striking in its scope. It surveyed
more than 38,000 people, most interviewed between July and October in
their homes. The survey questions were translated into 46 languages
and 17 dialects. In Mali, Egypt, Pakistan and some other countries,
however, the respondents were concentrated in more urban areas, a
sampling that could skew results.</TE>
<TE>   Some questions were banned in certain countries -- a question
about suicide bombers wasn't permitted by the Egyptian government,
for example, and China didn't allow its citizens to be asked about
the war on terrorism. The study was launched before Sept. 11, 2001,
but has since been broadened, and a follow-up project on attitudes
toward globalization is due next spring, Kohut said.</TE>
<TE>   The results, titled "What the World Thinks in 2002," were posted
on the Pew Web site, www.people-press.org.</TE>
<TE>   The study appeared to confirm America's cherished stereotype that
the French and other America-bashers love to lambaste the United
States, then line up to eat at McDonald's, buy American gizmos and
see Hollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   Large majorities in Europe, most of Latin America and even Lebanon
say they like American popular culture, while people in Egypt, Jordan
and Pakistan dislike it by large margins. American science and
technology command near-universal respect.</TE>
<TE>   But in country after country where people like American technology
and culture, they are displeased over the spread of American ideas.</TE>
<TE>   While Japan, the Philippines, Bulgaria and most of African nations
disagreed, majorities or pluralities in 29 countries in Europe, the
Americas, the Middle East and Asia said the spread of Americanism is
a bad thing. But 79% of Americans said it is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, there is broad support for the war on terrorism, except
in the Middle East, yet there is an equally strong global consensus
that the U.S. disregards the views of others in carrying out its
foreign policies, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ukraine, for example, 29% say the U.S. ignores others in
foreign policymaking, but 86% support the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
Seventy-five percent of Americans think the U.S. takes the interest
of other countries into account "a great deal" or "a fair amount."</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States' popularity ratings are slipping, most
people think the emergence of a rival superpower would be dangerous.
Russians agree 2 to 1 that a bipolar world would be more dangerous,
and that view is widely shared in the Middle East as well, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   It is often assumed that foreign publics may dislike American
policies, but they like Americans. "This distinction is fading, as
respondents in only 13 of 43 countries surveyed expressed more
positive attitudes about Americans than the U.S.," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In nearly every country in Latin America, people are at least as
negative about "Americans" as they are toward "the United States." In
Egypt, recipient of nearly $2 billion in U.S. aid this year, only 6%
of the people interviewed hold a favorable view of the United States,
and only 14% think well of Americans, the study found. In Pakistan,
just 10% hold a "favorable" attitude toward the U.S., while 17% like
Americans, the poll found.</TE>
<TE>   In a positive development for the U.S., the Russian people have
warmed substantially toward the United States, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pew poll echoes the findings of other surveys showing a
growing divide between the U.S. and major allies over Iraq policy.</TE>
<TE>   While strong majorities in the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and
Russia agreed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein poses a "great to
moderate" danger, British public opinion is evenly split on whether
to use force to remove him, and large majorities in France, Germany,
Russia and Turkey oppose the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, 44% of British citizens, 75% of French, 54% of Germans
and 76% of Russians believe America's motive in making war is to
control Iraqi oil.</TE>
<TE>   Ominously, the poll found that large fractions of the population
in many Muslim countries believe that suicide bombing is justified in
defense of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Majorities in Lebanon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Bangladesh shared
this view, as did roughly a third of the populations of Pakistan,
Mali, Ghana and Uganda, and 27% of Indonesians. However, 70% of Turks
and 84% of Uzbeks thought suicide bombing was not justifiable.</TE>

<TE>   While there is widespread belief in the U.S. and among its allies
that Iraq is at least a moderate threat, support for the use of force
to remove Saddam Hussein from power is lower abroad. Many in other
nations think the U.S. only wants to control Iraq's oil supplies.</TE>

<HD>Portugal, France on Alert as Oil From Tanker Moves Their

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAMINHA, Portugal</DL>
<LD>Portugal and France went on high alert Wednesday as oil slicks from
the sunken tanker Prestige encroached on their coasts and a tide of
sludge lapped on the shores of another Spanish nature reserve.</LD>
<LD>   The spill has already coated 183 beaches in Spain with fuel oil
despite the efforts of under-equipped and overwhelmed volunteers who
are helping the official cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   Oil-stained birds have begun turning up along the southwestern
French coast, officials there say, and small slicks from the spill
are drifting northeast toward France.</LD>
<TE>   President Jacques Chirac ordered his Cabinet on Wednesday to keep
special watch on France's west coast for oil slicks.</TE>
<TE>   Portuguese Defense Minister Paulo Portas said reconnaissance
flights found the closest oil slick was about 18 nautical miles from
the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Spain's Environment Ministry said the black tide
touched shore on at least two of the Cies Islands, a protected,
pristine archipelago that is a haven for migratory sea birds.</TE>

<HD>Strike in Venezuela Widens; Oil Sector Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A national strike was extended another day Wednesday, a surprise move
that dashed hopes for a quick return to negotiations for a permanent
solution to this country's worsening crisis.</LD>
<LD>   There were also signs that Venezuela's crucial oil sector was
suffering -- a development that could threaten the nation's economic
and political stability.</LD>
<LD>   An oil tanker captain for the state petroleum company took to the
airwaves late Wednesday to declare that he was joining the strike,
refusing to unload a shipment of 280,000 barrels of gas bound for
local markets.</LD>
<TE>   And tugboat captains announced that they would no longer guide
ships in and out of the narrow strait leading to Lake Maracaibo, the
center of Venezuela's oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to continue acting with the same firmness and the same
power," said Carlos Ortega, president of the Confederation of
Venezuelan Workers, the country's largest labor union. "The strike
continues. It isn't stopping."</TE>
<TE>   The decision caught off guard government negotiators and Cesar
Gaviria, the secretary-general of the Organization of American States
and mediator for talks between the opposition and President Hugo
Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   The talks had been expected to resume to discuss the opposition's
demand for a referendum in February on Chavez's rule.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who was briefly ousted in a coup in April, has said no
referendum is permitted until August under Venezuela's constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria said the decision to continue the strike a fourth day
threw into doubt recent advances.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to wait and see how this polarizes the situation between
the government and the opposition," said Gaviria, who has spent a
month trying to get the two sides to reach an accord. "This can make
the situation much more tense."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials continued to insist Wednesday that most
people were going to work, but the strike seemed to have moved beyond
the question of participation and into a new, more dangerous phase.</TE>
<TE>   The strike had been losing force until National Guard troops
unleashed a barrage of tear gas on unsuspecting protesters gathering
for a demonstration in front of a state oil company building Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The attack energized the opposition, a leaderless though
determined group that includes unions, businesses, media groups and
church figures.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that Chavez is becoming an increasingly authoritarian
figure leading the country to financial and social chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The attack especially angered employees with the state oil
company, PDVSA, many of whom were gassed in the attack and who have
long complained that Chavez is installing unqualified supporters
within the company.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, oil company employees were among the most ardent
supporters of continuing the strike, according to several people
close to the strike committee and negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   That in turn raised fears that the strike could turn ugly. PDVSA
employees' decision to join a strike in April led to the coup, which
left more than 60 dead in running street battles. Chavez was returned
to power two days later by loyal supporters and military forces. He
has been engaged in a political struggle ever since with an
opposition that continues to seek his removal.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition says that more than 90% of white-collar employees
and about 65% of blue-collar employees are on strike.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, at least one oil terminal, in Puerto La Cruz, was
shut down Wednesday, according to the provincial governor.</TE>
<TE>   Oil analysts said that the strike would first be felt on local gas
supplies, then on international markets.</TE>
<TE>   "When you begin to affect your local markets, things get
complicated," said Alberto Queros, an independent oil analyst. "It's
going to be very important to reach an agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Even government officials, who continued to insist Wednesday that
oil production remained unaffected, sounded nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "With a petroleum strike, nobody wins, and everybody loses," said
Ali Rodriguez, the head of the state oil company. "I'm worried, and
I'm busy."</TE>

<HD>Curfew Declared After Rioting in E. Timor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DILI, East Timor</DL>
<LD>East Timor clamped a curfew on the capital Wednesday after a day of
deadly unrest left part of Dili in ruins and the prime minister's
house in ashes, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of protesters went on a rampage, torching cars and a
supermarket and looting offices after police fatally shot a student
during a demonstration outside police headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   President Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao, who led the country's
struggle against Indonesian rule and enjoys huge popularity, pleaded
for peace. He visited the scene of the fighting and urged calm, but
was greeted with flying rocks.</LD>
<TE>   By evening, residents said the streets were empty except for U.N.
peacekeepers and East Timorese security officials.</TE>
<TE>   The unrest was the worst in East Timor since it became the world's
newest nation in May, and it highlights rising discontent with the
government. Most of East Timor's 800,000 people are desperately poor
and have seen few benefits of independence.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 students clashed with police early Wednesday in a
protest sparked by the arrest of a student the day before. Some
students threw stones at police officers at their headquarters, and
the officers opened fire, killing a 16-year-old boy, witnesses said.
Witnesses said a second person was also shot to death.</TE>

<HD>Turks Do Not Back U.S., Poll Finds</HD>
<DH>A full 83% of respondents oppose any use of nation's bases
to attack Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Turkey's public is deeply discontented with the direction the nation
is headed, and has become especially displeased with the United
States, at a time when the Bush administration needs Turkish military
help in any war on Iraq, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   Fully 83% of Turks in a study released Wednesday by the Pew
Research Center for the People &amp; the Press are opposed to the use of
their country's bases to strike Iraq. On a visit to Turkey this week,
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz won a pledge of
access to some bases, but Washington's North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ally said it was reluctant to permit large numbers of
American soldiers in the country.</LD>
<LD>   A look at public opinion sheds light on why the government might
fear cooperating too openly with a U.S. push to overthrow Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the Bush administration's staunch support for Turkey's key
goal, joining the European Union, the U.S. will have to overcome
widespread public mistrust if it hopes to win over the country's
public and its new government, dominated by a party with roots in the
Islamist opposition, the poll indicates.</TE>
<TE>   America's standing in Turkish eyes has plummeted from 52% who
viewed the U.S. favorably two years ago to just 30% today. Only 46%
of the 1,005 Turkish adults surveyed from July 21 to Aug. 9 thought
it would be a good thing if Hussein were removed from power, while
36% said it would be a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about U.S. motives, only 34% believe that the U.S. would use
military force because it sees Hussein as a threat to stability,
while 53% see such a move as part of an American war on Muslim
countries the U.S. perceives as unfriendly.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Turkey was an enthusiastic ally
of the first Bush administration. The Turks shut their oil pipeline
with Iraq, closed their borders and housed a flood of Iraqi refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The Turks were never compensated for their huge losses, said a
Washington-based expert on Turkey, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We got paid back -- the Turks got left holding the bag," the
expert said. "Figures vary, but to the tune of $40 to $60 billion."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Turkish public has a strong dislike for Hussein, many
Turks worry that a U.S. campaign to oust him would set the stage for
an Iraqi civil war, the creation of a breakaway republic by the Kurds
in Iraq's north, or a renewed exodus of refugees into Turkey, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Turks have been enduring a major economic crisis and
years of political upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew poll found that 47% of Turks felt they were better off
five years ago.</TE>

<HD>U.S. War Games Send a Loud Message to Iraq</HD>
<DH>Exercises using live fire are held in Kuwait, within
earshot of the neighbor next door.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UDAIRI RANGE, Kuwait</DL>
<LD>The American firepower arrayed within earshot of Iraq on Wednesday
morning was designed to overwhelm. More than 40 tanks and fighting
vehicles lined up across the desert in attack formation, with
self-propelled howitzers behind and helicopter gunships and
screeching F-16s above.</LD>
<LD>   When the attack began, it deafened: knee-buckling flashes of
orange fire from 120-millimeter laser-ranged tank rounds, whistling
barrages of 155-millimeter artillery shells, thumping .50-caliber
machine guns and bombs from unseen jets.</LD>
<LD>   Sand-filled dumpsters disguised as Iraqi tanks and pop-up plywood
Iraqi soldiers met their fate as targets.</LD>
<TE>   It was a war game, part of regularly scheduled training in
northern Kuwait. It is meant as practice for U.S. forces. But the
timing and location of the live-fire exercise by the U.S. Army's 2nd
Brigade, 1st Battalion, 64th Armor, also was meant to send a message
next door that was loud, clear and all too real.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations weapons inspectors are now in Iraq, which faces a
weekend deadline for a crucial declaration detailing its weapons
programs. With Wednesday's exercises, the U.S. military was backing
President Bush's words of warning that Iraq must come clean -- and
offering a demonstration of the alternative if it doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Literally, it's like a pistol, and the hammer is cocked," 2nd
Brigade commander Col. David Perkins said on the mock battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   From vast forward bases bristling with advanced satellite gear,
air-conditioned troop tents and even color TV in the northern desert,
to new ammunition depots, Mylar-windowed barracks and warehouses
longer than a football field south of Kuwait City, the U.S. military
has quietly put in place the logistics and much of the firepower to
invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet has a full aircraft-carrier battle group
in the Persian Gulf nearby, launching daily sorties that are bombing
air defenses in southern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Airfields from the tip of the Arabian Peninsula in Oman to the
Gulf nations of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have
squadrons of U.S. fighter jets and other attack aircraft with room
for many more.</TE>
<TE>   All that's missing are two or three divisions of troops and their
personal support equipment, which military sources and analysts say
could be shuttled into Kuwait City's international airport via
civilian jetliners within a few weeks, at most.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there are slightly more than 12,000 American military
personnel in Kuwait -- double the usual presence, yet thousands of
soldiers shy what would be needed for an invasion. There are more
than 44,000 American military personnel in the Mideast and Central
Asia, up from an average of between 20,000 to 25,000 in the last six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Most are here for training, war games that include a first-ever,
command-and-control test run in the region scheduled to begin with
force commander Gen. Tommy Franks at the helm of a new,
state-of-the-art mobile headquarters in Qatar next week. The
facility, designed to be deployable to any U.S. base in the region,
uses sophisticated computer and communications equipment to allow
commanders around the world to manage and monitor military activity
in real time.</TE>
<TE>   In Kuwait, a strategic staging ground for any land assault on
Iraq, the U.S. military's buildup has been largely material --
thousands of tons of hardware and the world's most sophisticated
software in secretive bases throughout the desert.</TE>
<TE>   So massive is that presence on Iraq's southern doorstep that it
covers more than 1,600 square miles -- larger than a quarter of
Kuwait, which is the size of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   It is the fruit of hundreds of millions of dollars in
construction, financed mostly by Kuwait in the last three years, and
a flotilla of cargo ships that quietly has brought hundreds of tanks,
artillery pieces and armored fighting vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   A fraction of that materiel is being used by the U.S. Army's 2nd
Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, out of Ft. Stewart, Ga., in the
ongoing Army exercise dubbed Desert Spring -- nearly 4,000 officers
who would be at the knife's edge of any U.S. invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The brigade, which calls itself "the tip of the spear of the
American military," arrived in September, the latest to rotate into
exercises that date back several years.</TE>
<TE>   The brigade is scheduled to remain here until March and in
interviews during the last week at their remote, heavily fortified
bases and in the field, the officers and enlisted men made it clear
they have thought often and deeply about fighting Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I say bring it on. If we're going to do it, let's do it," said
Maj. Rick Nussio of the 64th Armor tank battalion. "Everybody hopes
it's solved peacefully, but if it's not, we're here to do a job. And
we're ready to do it."</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's live-fire games, Command Sgt. Maj. William
Barnello said of his troops: "The guys are coming into their own now.
They're right where we want them. They're cocky.... We want them to
be bold and audacious."</TE>
<TE>   Barnello, who was a staff sergeant tank commander in the Gulf War
that defeated Iraq and drove its forces out of Kuwait nearly 12 years
ago, then turned to the issue at hand -- Wednesday's display of
overwhelming force less than 10 miles from the Iraqi border.</TE>
<TE>   "We're training on this piece of ground for a reason," he said.
"If Saddam Hussein doesn't know that there's an armored battalion out
here doing live fire today, then he doesn't just have bad
intelligence. He has no intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Barnello added: "I hope he doesn't do something stupid. But he has
a history of doing something stupid, and so, we're ready."</TE>
<TE>   A war on Iraq now, he added, is likely to be different than in
1991, when a huge, U.S.-led multinational force overran the Iraqi
armed forces in Kuwait in just three days and pushed them well inside
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take us a little bit longer now," Barnello said. "I
think we'll be a little more surgical.... We're going to take him out
and leave as much of the infrastructure as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The brigade's commander spoke in less certain terms of war's
inevitability. Col. Perkins acknowledged that his brigade and their
war games are meant to be "a deterrent" for Iraq, adding, "The time
and location [of Wednesday's exercise] is a great motivator, both for
our forces and for the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, though, the time and place merely "give added
focus and meaning" to the exercises themselves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spc. Joshua Steward, 23, of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., said he
thinks there's a 50-50 chance his brigade will go to war. Steward
drove one of the command tanks in Wednesday's exercise, which he
confirmed was all the more meaningful for its proximity to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "In case somebody's watching, it gives them a small sample of the
firepower we can bring to bear," he said. But when asked whether it
would deter the Iraqis from cheating on the weapons inspections,
Steward smiled and said, "I don't really think about it. I'm just out
here having fun."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Intends to Spend Millions on Turkish Bases</HD>
<DH>Pentagon is identifying sites, planning upgrades.
Improvements will not affect the start date of a war against Iraq,
Defense official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is planning to spend "hundreds of millions"
of dollars preparing bases in Turkey for U.S. and allied planes and
equipment, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said Wednesday,
as American officials appeared poised to press the key ally to host
large numbers of troops in the event of a war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Having secured a pledge from Turkey's newly elected government
this week to open some of the nation's ports and air bases to the
gathering U.S.-led coalition, Pentagon planners are now identifying
what bases they would need for an attack on Turkey's southern
neighbor and what it would take to upgrade them.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to go now immediately into very concrete discussions
about what facilities might be used, what forces might be employed on
them, how much money needs to be invested to bring them to the level
that we need," Wolfowitz said before leaving the Turkish capital,
Ankara. He was on his way to NATO headquarters in Brussels to seek
broader support for a campaign against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   "We're talking potentially about tens of millions -- probably
several hundred million dollars -- of investment in various
facilities we might use."</TE>
<TE>   Officials traveling with Wolfowitz said the improvements would not
affect the start date of any war with Iraq but that if the upgrades
were done on the fly, as was done elsewhere during the Afghan
campaign, the situation would be less than optimum.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, officials also stressed that the planned upgrading
was unlikely to affect U.S. war planning.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that it could affect our war plans is inconceivable to
me," said a senior U.S. military official Wednesday, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. "I just could not imagine that it would take
that much time."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has courted the leader of Turkey's new
Islamic-rooted ruling party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has
reluctantly embraced the U.S.-led military buildup despite broad
opposition among the Turkish public to any military action in Iraq.
Despite leading the Justice and Development Party, Erdogan has not
been allowed to serve as prime minister because he was barred from
office after being convicted of "religious sedition" in 1998.
Negotiations to give him the title are ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz pleased Turkish leaders during his visit with
suggestions that Turkey would gain financial and military aid for
supporting the anti-Iraq coalition, but the Turks expressed strong
reservations about large numbers of U.S. troops on their soil.</TE>
<TE>   Because of public concern over talk of war in Iraq, "it may be
difficult to see tens of thousands of American forces being
transported through the Turkish territory into Iraq," Turkish Foreign
Minister Yasar Yakis told reporters in Ankara on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Pentagon planners are expected to press Turkey to
allow tens of thousands of coalition troops on its soil in order to
prepare for a multi-pronged attack on Iraq from the north, south and
west.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar and Kuwait are expected to host U.S. troops in the south,
and to the south and west, Saudi Arabia has agreed to allow coalition
warplanes to use its airspace and the Prince Sultan Air Base
southeast of Riyadh, the capital. But the Americans have few options
to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if we're going to have significant ground forces, this
is the country they're going to have to come to," Wolfowitz told
reporters traveling with him in Ankara. "There is no other option."</TE>
<TE>   Getting a green light from the Turkish government on the bases
allows the Pentagon to move ahead with military planning that has
been in a "holding pattern" while Turkey's new leaders were preparing
to take office, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to fly U.S. warplanes out of Turkey is crucial to
waging a successful campaign against Iraq, military analysts have
said. With only a handful of air bases available to U.S. forces in
countries to Iraq's south, it would mean that planes flying out of
Turkey could well represent more than a third of the total air power
during an Iraq campaign, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has two air bases in Kuwait, one in Qatar and one in Oman
from which it would be able to fly combat missions into Iraq. Air
bases in Saudi Arabia are likely to be used only for support aircraft
such as tanker planes and for search and rescue operations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the U.S. has five aircraft carriers that could be
moved into the region at any one time to provide seaborne air bases
for fighter jets and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "A fundamental difference between this war and the last war is
that the last time they were mainly dropping bombs on stuff in and
around Kuwait," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a
defense think tank. "The focus of the air campaign this time is
Baghdad. Baghdad is in the middle of the country, and Turkey is close
by. Turkey is a heck of a lot closer to Baghdad than Oman is."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish bases are modern facilities built and outfitted to
fulfill Turkey's obligations as a member of NATO, which makes them
far superior to the airstrips in Central Asia that the U.S. upgraded
over several months to handle planes flying in the Afghanistan
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz still must contend with the Turks' belief that using
force to enforce the United Nations resolution requiring Iraq to
disclose and give up chemical, biological and nuclear weapons would
require a second action within the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   While the original resolution does not automatically authorize
force, Wolfowitz said, it requires only a meeting of the Security
Council and not necessarily another formal resolution. But U.S.
officials hope to iron out any potential disagreement with the Turks
in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are different views, I think, among Turks and ... within
the government. It is an important question and one I think we need
to clarify at the highest levels of both governments," Wolfowitz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to press the new Turkish government for firm commitments
quickly, Wolfowitz, during a late dinner Tuesday, extended an
invitation from President Bush to Erdogan to visit the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has offered a number of inducements to its
key Muslim ally, including campaigning for Turkey in the nation's
effort to get the European Union to set a date to discuss Ankara's
request for admission.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz lobbied British officials in London on Monday to approve
a plan that ties Turkey's request for a date for the EU to consider
its membership with a request by Cyprus to join.</TE>
<TE>   With Turks still suffering economic losses from the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, illustrated by sidelined diesel trucks unable to carry
their freight across the border to Iraq because of international
sanctions, U.S. envoys are discussing direct financial aid,
compensation for basing help and continued support of Turkey's
requests for aid from the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Wolfowitz met with George Robertson,
secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
other European officials. While the Bush administration is not
expected to ask NATO to play a direct role in any conflict with Iraq,
U.S. policymakers are seeking some military support from individual
members.</TE>
<TE>   British defense authorities, who are expected to contribute combat
troops, have agreed to every request their American counterparts have
made, a senior U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz met Monday with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Defense Minister Geoff Hoon.</TE>

<HD>United Denied Federal Bailout</HD>
<DH>The No. 2 U.S. airline and largest carrier at LAX is a step
closer to filing for bankruptcy. Flights could be cut back and jobs
imperiled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A United Airlines bankruptcy filing became almost certain Wednesday
when a federal panel rejected a $1.8-billion government loan
guarantee that the carrier needed to avoid running out of cash this
winter.</LD>
<LD>   Despite United's furious efforts in recent weeks to line up $5.2
billion in labor cost savings to win approval of the bailout, the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board described the airline's recovery
plan as "not financially sound" and said it would not put taxpayers'
money at risk.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the loan backing, "United would face a high probability
of another liquidity crisis within the next few years," the ATSB
said. The board was created after last year's terrorist attacks to
judge which airlines could tap $10 billion in guarantees that were
part of the industry's post-Sept. 11 aid package.</LD>
<TE>   "We are disappointed," said Glenn Tilton, chief executive of
United and its parent, UAL Corp. "We will consult with our union
leaders and other stakeholders and quickly determine what step to
take next."</TE>
<TE>   United -- the second-largest U.S. airline behind American and the
biggest operator at the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports -- has
said it would file under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws without
the loan guarantee. If so, it would mean that two of the seven
largest U.S. airlines would be operating under bankruptcy protection.
US Airways filed under Chapter 11 in August.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the final nail in the coffin -- United will have to file
for bankruptcy and probably very quickly," said analyst Philip
Baggaley of credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   As with US Airways, United's passengers would not see major
changes immediately, because a company keeps operating under Chapter
11 while it attempts to reorganize.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody over the Christmas season is going to be significantly
impacted," said Ron Kuhlmann, vice president of Unisys R2A, an
aviation consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   But he and other analysts said the longer-term effect of a United
bankruptcy filing on the airline industry would be profound.</TE>
<TE>   United, the dominant airline for both business and leisure travel
only a few years ago, would probably make sharp cuts in its flight
schedule as creditors demand that the carrier scale back to conserve
cash. Passengers might start booking away from United, fearing that
the Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based airline is too unsettled. Many of
United's 80,000 jobs -- including some of the 6,500 in Southern
California -- would be in jeopardy, and its union contracts could be
scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy filing also is likely to leave UAL's stock
practically worthless and put an end to United's journey through
employee stock ownership. The carrier is the nation's largest
employee-owned company, with workers controlling 55% of the shares.
Before the ATSB announcement, UAL's stock rose 7 cents a share to
$3.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "These are hard decisions, and I certainly feel for the affected
employees," Edward Gramlich, one of the ATSB's three members, said in
a statement. "At the same time, the loan board has a responsibility
to taxpayers, and to fostering the longer-term health of the airline
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Gramlich, a Federal Reserve governor, and Treasury Undersecretary
Peter Fisher rejected the airline's request. The third member,
Transportation Department General Counsel Kirk Van Tine, deferred his
vote until Monday, but his vote is now moot. Daniel Montgomery, the
ATSB's executive director, said United could reapply for a loan
guarantee but as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   A United bankruptcy filing could eventually ripple across
California. Airports in Los Angeles, Orange County, Burbank and
Ontario account for more than 140 of United's 1,775 total daily
flights. Many of United's most heavily traveled routes involve
connections between Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the airline also might slash fares -- at first to keep
generating income -- and that would force other major airlines to
take similar actions to stay competitive. But if United gets its
costs under control, the carrier and its rivals might push fares back
up again, some analysts predict.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, United will have to drastically downsize in a Chapter
11," said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition,
an advocacy group that had urged the ATSB to approve the loan
guarantee. "This decision will put at significant risk the interests
of the consumer, United Airlines' employees and the economy."</TE>
<TE>   United's viability probably would affect other U.S. companies.
Indeed, Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that a United bankruptcy
filing might force it to write down a $114-million leveraged
investment in the carrier's aircraft leases.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hammer, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce, said the decision was a blow to the region's economy and
tantamount to "letting the terrorists win, because their objective
was to disrupt America and its economy."</TE>
<TE>   But many others have argued that United's management and unions,
two sides that have been at odds for years, have only themselves to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   Such critics contend that the Sept. 11 attacks -- which involved
two hijacked United jetliners -- and the subsequent drop in air
travel exacerbated structural problems that already were eroding
United's position. They also maintain that United and its unions
should have addressed the problems long before the ATSB was
established.</TE>
<TE>   Management missteps included spending a year pursuing a
$4.3-billion merger with US Airways, only to have it scuttled in the
face of antitrust concerns. And the pilots and mechanics unions,
which hold seats on UAL's board of directors, won new contracts that
made United's labor costs among the highest in the industry just as
travel -- especially lucrative business travel -- was slumping.</TE>
<TE>   UAL, which lost an industry record $2.1 billion in 2001, lost an
additional $1.7 billion in the first nine months of this year and is
still spending about $5 million more than it receives in revenue
every day.</TE>
<TE>   One harsh critic of a United loan guarantee is Continental
Airlines, itself a survivor of Bankruptcy Court. "The U.S. government
did the right thing for the taxpayers and for competition by letting
the marketplace determine winners and losers," Continental said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB has been stingy in awarding loan guarantees. In rejecting
United's bid, the panel said that the airline's recovery plan -- even
with its proposed labor savings -- would be insufficient "to achieve
long-term financial stability" and that United's revenue projections
were "unreasonably optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   United had asked the ATSB to back $1.8 billion of a $2-billion
loan it would have obtained through conventional lenders. If United
defaulted, the federal government would be responsible for covering
the loan with taxpayers' money.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, the other ATSB member who voted against United, said,
"This is not just about costs, it's about a business plan that is
fundamentally flawed."</TE>
<TE>   Under Tilton, who has been CEO for only three months, United raced
to line up wage concessions from its pilots, mechanics and flight
attendants to get the loan secured before its cash crunch became too
severe. United faced debt payments of $920 million on Monday, but it
invoked grace periods to get a few days' breathing room to complete
its agreements with the unions.</TE>
<TE>   United's pilots and flight attendants ratified their concessions,
and the International Assn. of Mechanics was scheduled to vote again
today on their $700-million portion of the givebacks. But the
mechanics canceled the vote Wednesday night because it "would be
pointless," union President Tom Buffenbarger said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders decried the ATSB vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely disappointed by the decision ... and do not
agree with the board's analysis of United's business plan nor the
timing of its announcement," Paul Whiteford, head of the United
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Assn., said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Davidowitch of the Assn. of Flight Attendants said the ATSB
vote was "not just disappointing, it's irresponsible. And we call on
the ATSB to reconsider United's application."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How a United Airlines bankruptcy protection filing could affect
consumers:</TE>
<TE>   What should consumers expect now that United Airlines' request for
a $1.8-billion government loan guarantee has been rejected?</TE>
<TE>   Question: What happens if it files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court
protection?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: United gains protection from its creditors but loses
control of its restructuring and its stock is almost certain to
become worthless. A Bankruptcy Court judge can order steeper cutbacks
than the ones already proposed by United, and alter or even dissolve
its labor and other contracts; the employee stock ownership plan also
could be scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Many of United's 80,000 jobs could be affected. The airline
employs about 6,500 in Southern California alone.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will the carrier stop flying?</TE>
<TE>   A: United has pledged to keep operating its normal schedule during
bankruptcy protection, just as US Airways has been doing since it
filed for Chapter 11 in August. "In the short run, this doesn't need
to affect travelers at all," said Darrell Jenkins, head of George
Washington University's Aviation Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will frequent-flier miles be affected?</TE>
<TE>   A: Experts say they probably are safe. Frequent-flier programs are
one of the airlines' best marketing tools and unlikely to be
suspended even in Bankruptcy Court. It's possible the programs could
be tightened to require more miles. Even if United were to go out of
business in the future, a competitor would probably step in and honor
25% to 50% of the miles to try to create loyal new customers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would a bankruptcy filing affect United and its passengers
over the longer term?</TE>
<TE>   A: To shrink its capacity in a bid to become profitable again,
United may ground more planes, drop service to some markets,
eliminate unprofitable international routes and reduce the number of
cross-country flights.</TE>
<TE>   That could be especially true at Los Angeles International
Airport, other Southern California airports and San Francisco
International Airport, where United is a major player.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the odds of United surviving a bankruptcy filing?</TE>
<TE>   A: Uncertain. Continental Airlines, America West and others
survived bankruptcy filings; Eastern, Pan Am and Midway didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "If they make peace with labor, they will come out of Chapter 11
stronger than they've ever been. If they have any travel disruptions
due to labor unrest, then they become the next Eastern Airlines,"
Jenkins said.</TE>

<HD>Quake Fault Found Under Belmont Site</HD>
<DH>Belated discovery at the plagued campus leaves L.A. school
officials scrambling for answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand, Joe Mathews and Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials said Wednesday that they will consider
abandoning the half-finished and trouble-ridden Belmont Learning
Complex because seismologists belatedly discovered a small earthquake
fault running directly beneath two buildings of the high school
campus.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Education, which three years ago stopped work at the
school because of pollution problems there and then moved to revive
it this year, now must weigh politically painful options: rebuild the
campus on a seismically safer portion of the current 35-acre site
near downtown, tear down some buildings, or raze the campus
altogether and try to find land to build it elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very sad day," Los Angeles Unified School District Supt.
Roy Romer told a news conference Wednesday at L.A. Unified
headquarters, two blocks from the Belmont site. "I had a lot at stake
in trying to build Belmont. But it's imperative to change your mind
when you're confronted with new facts."</LD>
<TE>   Romer now faces outrage from downtown area parents and community
members demanding to know why the fault line wasn't discovered much
earlier. And the school district, which won voters' approval of a
$3.3-billion construction bond issue last month in part by repairing
its past image of incompetence, may face a damaging revival of its
credibility problems.</TE>
<TE>   Most school board members said they were leaning toward abandoning
the campus at that location, but stressed that they awaited more
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The least expensive alternative would be to build a smaller campus
on 12 acres of the site at an estimated cost of $45 million or $60
million. A plan that salvages four of the six current buildings would
cost an estimated $70 million, officials said. That would be on top
of $175 million the district has spent on the project and its legal
bills, already making it the most expensive high school in California
history.</TE>
<TE>   Belmont supporters had hoped that mitigation of toxic gases from
old oil wells under the much-studied land would start soon and that
the school, which sits partly boarded up next to the Harbor Freeway,
would open in three years in a neighborhood that has badly
overcrowded campuses. They also wondered whether the district might
overreact to the new study, noting that such fissures are common in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   A study in the late 1990s determined that the school could be
built without significant seismic concerns, according to state
officials who signed off on the site's seismic safety.</TE>
<TE>   "When are you going to give us our schools that have been promised
for over 10 years now?" asked Hector Villagra, regional counsel for
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "That's what
can't get lost in this. Once you abandon that site, where else in
that community are you going to find [land] to build a high school?"</TE>
<TE>   The new Belmont campus was supposed to serve 3,600 students, take
thousands of them off buses and relieve overcrowding at the existing
5,000-student Belmont High nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed because I wanted to go to a new school," said
Xiomara Cabrera, 14, a freshman at Belmont High. "This school is way
too crowded. There's too many kids. And it's old."</TE>
<TE>   Romer said that the district would keep its promise of a new
Belmont in some form and that any shortfall in capacity would be
offset by changing other future construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not whether we are going to build a [Belmont] school, but
it's where we are going to build a school," Romer said. He said he
had hoped that progress on Belmont would show that the district's
past mismanagement of the project's environmental problems had been
overcome and that the district could be trusted with plans to build
more than 100 other schools.</TE>
<TE>   Details of what geologists called a minor fault in the Elysian
Park seismic system emerged in a preliminary study the district
released Wednesday. That report found what its author deemed a
troublesome fault cutting diagonally beneath the site and under two
buildings. The researchers could not determine whether the fault is
active, partly because so much topsoil had been removed, making it
impossible to know the fault's recent history.</TE>
<TE>   But the study's author, Caltech geology professor Kerry Sieh,
urged the school board to act conservatively. In the report from his
company, Earth Consultants International, he wrote: "It seems prudent
to us that the district assume that the principal minor fault zone on
the property ... is active."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the fault was discovered while the district was
investigating ways to clean up the toxic gases before resuming
construction. The district ordered the study after a review last
spring of oil pressure in abandoned wells at the site found
disturbances in the ground that might indicate faults.</TE>
<TE>   A seismic firm mapped the site in September and found evidence of
a fault 725 feet below the surface. Then the district brought in
Sieh's company, which supervised the digging of 6,000 feet of shallow
trenches, no more than 12 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Several leading geologists said they were not surprised to learn
of the newly discovered Belmont trace fault in a region where
schools, hospitals and other facilities sit atop or near hazardous
earthquake zones. And some said school officials were acting with too
much panic.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal feeling is this is a bit of a red herring," said
Thomas Henyey, deputy director of the Southern California Earthquake
Center. "There are so many places in Southern California you can have
earthquake shaking and there are many schools near active faults at
more risk. You just build them strong enough so they can withstand
the shaking."</TE>
<TE>   However, Nabih Youssef, a structural engineer hired by the
district to work with Sieh, said the issue was not just the
building's ability to withstand shaking. Because the newly discovered
fault is directly underneath the building, a quake on that fault
could cause earth movement of 12 inches and a rupture that could
destroy the foundation. "There is no amount of retrofitting to cure
that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts said the district could have easily missed the fault
line when the site was studied in the late 1990s. They said searching
for fault lines is an inexact science.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like forecasting the weather, except all the clouds
are two miles down," said Dennis Bellet, chief structural engineer at
the Division of State Architects, which reviews all school design
plans. "Sometimes the faults are easy to detect. Sometimes they are
real hard to detect. It varies with soil conditions [and] the type of
fault."</TE>
<TE>   Still, state law prohibits schools from being built within 50 feet
of a fault that has ruptured the surface in the past. There is no
evidence that the fault under Belmont has ruptured, and that leaves
officials with a lot of uncertainties about whether it is legal to
build there.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the disclosure of the fault line came as a personal
and political blow to Romer, who made Belmont a priority from his
first week on the job more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It will lead to people questioning the LAUSD leadership," said
Fernando Guerra, director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles
at Loyola Marymount University. "It certainly is a reason to try to
understand LAUSD and its bureaucracy. Why didn't we know this
sooner?"</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Romer persuaded six of seven school board
members to finish the school, which had been abandoned in January
2000 because of concerns about toxic gases beneath the site. The
project has had a tortured history, with lawsuits between the school
district and its developer and law firm, and a continuing probe by
the district attorney of possible violations of environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   The school board in March picked a coalition of Latino business
and civic groups -- Alliance for a Better Community -- to clean up
the environmental problems and finish the campus.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Romer said his team would continue to look for any
soil off-site that has not been disturbed to confirm whether the
fault is active. "If anyone has any way of getting more evidence
about it, please let us know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If that search does not bear fruit, Romer said, he will recommend
halting construction of Belmont as it is currently configured. Within
60 days, he will make a recommendation on which option to pursue.</TE>
<TE>   School board members said Wednesday that they were dismayed by the
revelations about earthquake hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't build a school there now. It's just not safe," said
board member Mike Lansing, who suggested using the site for a
recreation center. "What are you going to do with that property,
given all the ... problems?"</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Lansing, board members David Tokofsky, Marlene
Canter and Genethia Hudley Hayes said they had reservations about
proceeding with the school. (Julie Korenstein, a previous foe of
completing the campus, could not be reached for comment.) They
expressed concerns not only about safety but also about additional
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "My initial feeling is I want to look elsewhere," Canter said. "I
am going to keep an open mind ... but I'm not going to sacrifice our
kids' safety."</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky added: "Anything that can stop the hemorrhaging of funds
for this project, the better off we are going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Board member Jose Huizar said he favors the option of building a
smaller school on 12 acres on the northwest corner of the property
that is mostly bedrock and seismically safe, according to
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Built for 1,500 students, such a school would cost $45 million,
for 2,000 students, $60 million. Either way, the district would be
short of the 3,600-student capacity envisioned for the Belmont
Learning Complex.</TE>

<HD>Southland Has Hundreds of Faults</HD>
<DH>They can be hard to find and are usually minor, but pose a
potential for major damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The discovery of a minor fault trace running beneath the Belmont
Learning Center site is no surprise to Southern California
geologists: The entire region is crisscrossed by hundreds of large
and small faults, many of them unidentified.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very difficult to go to any part of Southern California and
find a piece that doesn't have faults cutting through it," said James
Dolan, a geologist at USC. "The question is, is the fault active?
Most of them probably aren't."</LD>
<LD>   What complicates matters in the Belmont case -- and for any school
in the Los Angeles Basin -- is that the major faults in this area are
blind-thrust faults that are buried and therefore difficult to detect
or avoid.</LD>
<TE>   Surface-rupturing faults such the San Andreas are easier to build
around because they leave a huge trace on the surface. State law
prohibits the construction of schools or occupied buildings within 50
feet of surface ruptures but does not specifically ban construction
above blind-thrust faults, which can cause damage over a vast
territory, geological survey officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "When the faults are miles underground and angled, like the fault
system running beneath Belmont, it is difficult to say exactly which
parts of the ground above are vulnerable to earthquake shaking," said
Susan Hough, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey office in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't pinpoint a line and say this is where it's going
to shake. Strong shaking would be smeared across a larger area....
You're hard-pressed to say one site in L.A. is much worse than any
other."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Heaton, a professor of engineering and seismology at
Caltech agreed: "How do you site anything in the L.A. Basin?" he
asked. "The issue becomes one not of where do you site them but how
do you build them?"</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the legal requirements for placement of schools and
other critical buildings are lagging behind earthquake science, which
has only in the last decade revealed the hidden dangers of thrust
faults. Scientists say they are now on the verge of predicting
shaking and other hazards locally -- work that will help guide school
construction.</TE>
<TE>   For now, many experts advocate making schools and other critical
buildings such as hospital and fire stations strong enough to
withstand the largest quake predicted for a particular building site,
even if there is only a small chance such a large quake would occur.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said Wednesday that they wanted to err on the
side of caution. Although the newly discovered fault is part of a
blind-thrust fault system, geologists hired by the district said they
fear the fault could cause damage close to the surface or even
rupture the ground and harm buildings to the point that children
could be injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont complex, like much of downtown, is above the Elysian
Park fault system. The fault system, smaller and less active than the
San Andreas, is thought to be capable of generating 6.7 magnitude
quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters are the toxic gases buried within the
site. It is possible for an earthquake to unleash a toxic cloud
during a rupture, even with mitigation measures, but geologists are
uncertain about the likelihood of such a scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Geologists studying this fault system, like Dolan, say it may not
be active at all. At the very least, it appears to be far less active
than it was millions of years ago. Trying to determine whether the
fault is still active and how often it may have spawned large
temblors is difficult because such faults are often miles
underground.</TE>
<TE>   The current survey, conducted by Caltech geologist Kerry Sieh,
could not determine whether the fault underneath Belmont is active
because much of the soil at the surface needed for analysis had been
removed for oil recovery or during construction of the school.</TE>
<TE>   Lest there be any doubt of the potential for damage by an active
blind-thrust fault, the 6.7 Northridge quake in 1994 was caused by
one. Since then, geologists have become increasingly aware that the
populous Los Angeles Basin faces more of a hazard from widespread
shaking caused by the half-dozen major blind thrusts here than from
the distant San Andreas.</TE>
<TE>   "If any of those faults go," Hough said, "the L.A. Basin is going
to shake like a bowl of Jell-O."</TE>

<HD>In Gangs' Territory, a Weary Hope</HD>
<DH>The neighborhoods most affected by violence have heard it
all before. Still, they are looking to Chief Bratton for action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mitchell Landsberg and John L. Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody needs to tell Stephanie Johnson about the human cost of gang
warfare in Los Angeles. Bound up somewhere in the police logs of
victims is the name of her firstborn son.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Heard was 19 and not associated with any gang when he was
gunned down in July 1992, the first person to be killed after a
much-touted truce that was hailed as the beginning of the end of gang
warfare in the city. Heard was standing in front of his grandmother's
South L.A. home. Gang members mistook him for a rival.</LD>
<LD>   Now, more than 10 years later, his mother fears for the safety of
her younger son, Jonathan, who is 16 and a forward on the Dorsey High
School basketball team.</LD>
<TE>   "Something needs to be done," she said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton had
become the latest in a line of city leaders to declare war on gangs.
Bratton promised to dismantle the Bloods, the Crips and other gangs
in much the same way that law enforcement picked apart the five
families of the Mafia in New York City, where he formerly served as
police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine, said Johnson. "I hope it works."</TE>
<TE>   But like many people in Los Angeles, especially in neighborhoods
where gangs are a part of everyday life, she sees the need for much
more. Police alone can't solve the problem, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk to parents about taking control, taking back the
households," said Johnson, who works at the Blazers, an after-school
program on 48th Street near the Harbor Freeway, five blocks from
where her son was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "So many parents are busy, they're working. Their children don't
have chores. They come in, they just eat and sleep. Kids have to have
responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's declaration has evoked a range of responses, from hope
to fear to hollow laughter. If there was a consensus view Wednesday,
it was one of weary skepticism and a feeling that Bratton's Mafia
comparison was way off the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to pack his bags and go back East," said Matthew
"Studder Box" Brown, who lives in South-Central Los Angeles and is a
longtime community activist who works with gangs. "He doesn't know
Los Angeles and doesn't know L.A.'s gangs.... The Mafia is like a
money-making enterprise. In Los Angeles, the gangs are like tribes."</TE>
<TE>   Father Greg Boyle, an Eastside priest, said, "If gang violence is
anything, it's disorganized crime."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the violence is, it is seemingly continuous. The latest
reminder came Wednesday afternoon, when shooting erupted at an
alleged gang member's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Several young men, alleged gang associates of the deceased, were
walking to a funeral home at 95th Street and Vermont Avenue, police
said, and were approached by a rival. The mourners gave chase, firing
several shots at the man. They missed him, but struck his 22-year-old
sister in the eye with a shotgun pellet. They fled in a black
limousine.</TE>
<TE>   By the time police found the car several blocks away, the men were
gone.</TE>
<TE>   Gangs have been part of the Los Angeles streetscape since before
World War II. The early gangs left behind no large body count, but
that began to change in the late 1960s as they acquired guns in
greater numbers and expanded illegal drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1980s, police estimate, there were 400 gangs and 45,000
members in the city. By the early 1990s, the gang population had
risen to an estimated 100,000. Gangs were claiming hundreds of
victims a year.</TE>
<TE>   Every modern L.A. police chief has waged war on the gangs, none
with great success. Along the way, some have alienated broad swaths
of the city with gang sweeps that were perceived as indiscriminate,
particularly those aimed at African American gangs in South L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "When they crack down on the gangs, people who haven't been doing
anything pay the price," said Keith Humdy, a retail clerk who lives
in a shelter near 83rd Street and Western Avenue, near where
17-year-old Ernest Miller was killed Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "If you really want to crack down, you have to bring people
together," Humdy added. "If you really want something positive to
happen, you have to educate everyone. Otherwise, it seems that
everyone just runs amok."</TE>
<TE>   In remarks this week, Bratton has stressed the need for the police
and community to work together. He has asked people throughout the
city -- not just in the gang-plagued neighborhoods -- to be outraged
by the growing carnage.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD believes gangs are responsible for about half of the
city's more than 600 homicides so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he used the courtyard of the 77th Community Police
Station in South-Central to swear in two new deputy chiefs and
reiterate his promise. "People of this neighborhood deserve more from
us," Bratton said, "and they will get it."</TE>
<TE>   To some people, tired and fearful, Bratton's words are a balm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 100% in favor of them cracking down," said the Rev. Leonard
Jackson, an associate minister at First African Methodist Episcopal
Church in West Adams. "It's a shame that 99% of our population is
living in fear within our own community.</TE>
<TE>   "People are crying out, 'Enough is enough. We are living in fear.
We are prisoners in our community.' But it has to be understood that
the police are not going to do this alone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But standing in front of the Sunset Boulevard office in Hollywood
where she works, Toni Bowman, 26, said she has little faith in
pronouncements such as Bratton's.</TE>
<TE>   "I live in South Los Angeles, in the spot where they're doing all
the killings, and I don't see enough police cars on the street," said
Bowman, an office administrator for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
"All that politics, all that talk -- they just need to get out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman added that police need to build trust so people will feel
comfortable coming to them with information. As a young black woman,
she said, she has been pulled over by police because of her race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard for them to separate out who they're looking
for," she said. "There's gangbangers out there who look ... like
ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   Few people have a closer view of L.A. gangs than Father Boyle,
whose Jobs for a Future program seeks to employ gang members and
divert them from violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with declaring war on gangs is you end up waging it,"
Boyle said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He said similar police tactics in the past have demonized young
people and caused police officers to overstep their bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Hernandez, founder of the Inner City Games, based at the
Hollenbeck Youth Center, said that cracking down on gang members with
a muscular police presence must be accompanied by programs aimed at
preventing youths from joining gangs in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "What the mayor and the chief proposed might be a part of it, but
they've got to keep totally focused, that there's not a silver
bullet," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   "The energy needed to solve this gang problem is going to have to
come from the entire city."</TE>

<HD>Latest Abuse Revelations Stun Boston</HD>
<DH>In a community where Catholics thought they'd heard it all,
the new disclosures leave the faithful reeling. Many blame the
archbishop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A longtime parishioner telephoned Father Walter Cuenin early
Wednesday at Our Lady Help of Christians Church. After the latest
disclosures about how the Roman Catholic archdiocese here covered up
clerical sexual abuse for decades, she told her priest, she had no
choice but to leave the church.</LD>
<LD>   Not the parish, she stressed. The faith.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems to me that we are in total disarray," said Cuenin,
adding that he too was struggling to process the descriptions of
sordid behavior contained in thousands of pages of church documents
made public Tuesday. He learned from the new material that one of his
seminary classmates had earned the sobriquet "Father Pothead" because
of his habit of supplying drugs to members of Catholic youth groups.</LD>
<TE>   Around Boston on Wednesday, Catholics who thought they had heard
it all were reeling. After nearly a year of crisis, church officials
here were speaking as recently as last week about healing. Cardinal
Bernard Law paid an unprecedented visit to a gathering of
clerical-abuse survivors. He met with leaders of Voice of the
Faithful, a breakaway Catholic organization that he had steadily
denounced after it emerged in January in response to the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Then a new bombshell hit in the form of 11,000 pages of
confidential church records ordered released as part of a series of
civil suits against Law and the archdiocese. Encompassing the case
histories of eight priests over a 40-year period, the first 2,200
pages of these documents were made public Tuesday. These once-secret
personnel files both broadened the range of offenses committed by
priests and implicated virtually every bishop and archbishop who
worked in Boston in the last four decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when we thought we had heard the worst, we hear more," said
Thomas H. Groome, a theology professor at Boston College. "This
scandal weighs heavily upon us."</TE>
<TE>   So powerful are the emotions wracking many Catholics here, said
Voice of the Faithful spokesman Mike Emerton, that "I almost think
there needs to be a new word to portray our actual feelings. It would
be a word that encompasses anger, sadness, outrage, shock and shame.
I don't think that word exists yet."</TE>
<TE>   Surveys taken in October at many parishes in the nation's
fourth-largest archdiocese show that Mass attendance is down by 20%
or more over the same time last year. Weekly collections also have
dropped, and giving to the annual Cardinal's Fund has plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the animus is aimed at Law. The country's senior Catholic
prelate dodges pickets outside Holy Cross Cathedral by entering
through a rear door before Mass. And he canceled his annual spring
garden party, traditionally a top event on Boston's busy social
calendar.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has sat through days of depositions in lawsuits
brought by hundreds of alleged abuse victims. Excerpts of his
testimony have circulated like best-selling reading material.</TE>
<TE>   Law spent months after the scandal broke insisting that underlings
were responsible for transferring deviant priests from parish to
parish. Recently, he stood before the sparse congregation that
attends his weekly Mass at the cathedral and offered a near-abject
apology.</TE>
<TE>   But Law's name and signature appear over and over in the documents
released here. In some cases, he sends upbeat messages to priests
accused of terrible activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the thing that surprises me most is that Cardinal Law is
still here," said Rodney Ford, whose son Greg allegedly was raped for
years by retired priest Paul Shanley. "What kind of man is he?"</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gallagher, founder of Boston's Coalition of Catholics and
Survivors, said the latest revelations further weaken the cardinal's
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It is inconceivable to me that a guy who has had 18 years to fix
it, and now says he is going to fix it, will fix it," Gallagher said.</TE>
<TE>   Groome said his e-mail at Boston College contained many new
messages Wednesday calling for Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "But if he hasn't resigned by now, I doubt if he will do it now,"
said Groome, author of "What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts for
Life."</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence about abusive priests and the hierarchy that
protected them comes just days after reports surfaced that the Boston
archdiocese may file for bankruptcy protection to minimize costly
settlements with survivors. (An archdiocesan financial panel
Wednesday gave the green light for such a filing, should church
leaders deem it necessary.)</TE>
<TE>   But Emerton, of Voice of the Faithful, said the real issue goes
beyond financial solvency.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen with these new documents is complete moral
bankruptcy across the board," he said. "And this ranges from priests
in the parish engaging in drug abuse or the beating of individuals to
the bishops who have actively known of their problems, but yet
repeatedly transferred them into new parishes without alerting the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Reams of new documents -- close to 10,000 additional pages -- will
be released by plaintiffs' lawyers in coming weeks. Far from
disquieting, for some Catholics here the prospect of taking the lid
off more church secrets is a welcome development.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus said someplace in the Gospel -- Luke, Chapter 12, Verse 2
-- that what is concealed will be revealed," Groome said. "It looks
as if that is what is happening to us. There will be a deep purging.
And hopefully, it will be a crucifixion before a resurrection."</TE>
<TE>   At his church in Newton, outside Boston, Cuenin said he was
writing a note to the woman who was leaving the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I am asking her to keep the lines of communication open," the
priest said. "Maybe down the road there might be some possibility for
healing."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The finance committee of the Boston Archdiocese authorized the church
to pursue bankruptcy proceedings as a method of settling at least 450
sexual abuse lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's vote by the 12-person group is the first step toward
allowing the church to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.</LD>
<LD>   Such a filing would be the first by an archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   While no final decision has been made, the archdiocese said in a
statement, bankruptcy is being considered as a way "to ensure an
expeditious and equitable global settlement for the victims of sexual
abuse by priests from the archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican would have to approve any bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey said
church leaders here favor a global settlement that would "serve as an
alternative to resolving each case by separate litigation or
negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   "A mediated resolution would be preferable to seeking Chapter 11
protection," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between the archdiocese and victims' lawyers have been
underway for months.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorney Mitchell Garabedian called bankruptcy a risky
strategy because it would force the church to "reveal assets to a
civil and secular court." That court would then appoint a trustee to
control the assets.</TE>

<HD>White House Including Political Appointees in Bonus Program</HD>
<DH>Critics calls the practice an opening for abuse and say it
takes money from civil servants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration confirmed Wednesday that it is reinstating a
controversial bonus program under which high-ranking political
appointees would be eligible for annual awards of $10,000 or more --
a practice banned in 1994 amid concerns of possible abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The White House played down the action, likening federal
"performance-based awards" to those offered in the private sector,
while critics said the move further revealed President Bush's
misplaced priorities and his disdain for career civil servants.</LD>
<LD>   Under a March 29 directive issued without fanfare by White House
Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., about 2,000 political appointees
throughout the administration became eligible for such bonuses,
joining the 1.8 million employees in the federal workforce.</LD>
<TE>   "This policy is a restoration of a long-standing bipartisan policy
that has been pursued by multiple American administrations because
... federal workers deserve to be rewarded for good work, and there
should not be a distinction between those who do good work because
they're civil and those who do good work because they're appointed,"
said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary. "Good work is
good work."</TE>
<TE>   But because all bonuses come from the same pool of funds in each
department's personnel budget, and because higher-ranking political
appointees traditionally receive larger payments, there will be less
bonus money available for the lower-ranking civil servants, said Paul
C. Light, director of the Center for Public Service at the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan Washington public policy center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's zero-sum. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the bonus program by the New York Times on Wednesday
came at a particularly inauspicious moment for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Only last week, he cited the cost of the war on terrorism as he
disclosed that he would set pay increases for federal employees at
3.1%, instead of the 4.1% sought by Congress. Several weeks earlier,
he announced plans to allow the private sector to compete for nearly
half of the nation's federal civilian jobs, a move that enraged labor
unions and their Democratic allies in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   News of the bonus program's revival prompted 90 House Democrats to
accuse Bush, in a group letter organized by Rep. George Miller
(D-Martinez), of possessing "a tin ear for the economic concerns of
average Americans."</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that at least some in the administration regard the
issue as a potential political hot potato, one agency spokeswoman,
requesting anonymity, said her boss, a Cabinet secretary, has decided
that the department will not award bonuses to political appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a difficult precedent to set," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Department of Energy also have not handed out any
bonuses, according to spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto. "Obviously, we're
aware of the memo," she said. "But our evaluation process is not
finished yet."</TE>
<TE>   One agency that has awarded bonuses is the Department of Justice,
where many employees have worked long hours on counter-terrorism
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Of 121 eligible political appointees, only 10 have received
bonuses, according to a senior Justice Department official. They all
have been at Justice for a year or more, and no bonus exceeded
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "At Justice, you've got a lot of people working around the clock
after 9/11," said one administration official. "This is a decision
being made department by department."</TE>
<TE>   No White House employee will receive a bonus, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The bonus program for senior political appointees had existed at
least three decades until it was terminated eight years ago by
President Bill Clinton, in part because of a furor over awards given
in the waning days of the outgoing Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's action was part of an initiative to bring about what he
vowed would be a highly ethical administration.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to be different, and they started out on a high
horse. They imposed tougher ethics rules, tougher post-employment
lobbying rules, tougher disclosure rules," Light recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Leon E. Panetta, who was Clinton's chief of staff when the
decision was made, said: "My view was this was subject to too much
abuse. If you have a political appointee making a decision as to
who's going to get bonuses, there's a temptation to basically help
your friends."</TE>
<TE>   In his memo, Card emphasized that all awards must be based on
"substantial work achievements that go well beyond the performance of
routine duties."</TE>
<TE>   According to an Office of Personnel Management official, the
larger a proposed bonus, the higher the level of approval would be
required.</TE>
<TE>   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said proposed
bonuses of $10,000 or more must be approved by cabinet-level
officials or the department head.</TE>
<TE>   Awards of $25,000 or higher must be approved by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible political appointees include senior attorneys, top policy
advisors and confidential aides -- none of whom require Senate
confirmation. Many of them earn from $115,000 to $140,000.</TE>
<TE>   Department heads and other senior officials who must undergo
Senate confirmation are not eligible, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, 430,000 civil servants received bonuses, averaging $880
each, with a total federal outlay of about $380 million, Light said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the federal pay scale remains woefully behind
the private sector but said that payments to political appointees
"look and smell bad. They smack of favoritism." Many of the newly
eligible, he said, are "little more than bag carriers for the higher
political appointees," people who probably worked for the election of
the president.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleischer defended the bonus program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incentive for the ... hardest-working employees who are
able to do the most concrete, measurable work on behalf of the
taxpayers, an incentive program to give them bonuses, much like
everybody receives in the private sector," Fleischer said.</TE>

<LD>A wood- and coal-burning furnace started a fire that destroyed an
Amish family's home in Pulaski, killing five children sleeping
inside, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Rudy and Lizzie Wengerd escaped into the bitter cold with their
four other children Tuesday night, but the fire was too intense for
anyone to get back inside to rescue the others.</LD>
<LD>   The home was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, and a
second-story room filled with children crashed into the basement,
authorities said.</LD>

<LD>A New York mobster believed to have smuggled his sperm out of a
prison has been indicted, along with his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Granato came under suspicion four years ago after he was
seen in a visitation room at Allenwood Federal Prison showing off a
toddler he said was his, even though he had been in jail since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Granato, 42, and his wife, Regina, each were indicted on two
counts of criminal conspiracy. She could get six years in prison if
convicted. Granato, whose current sentence runs until 2012, could get
35 more years.</LD>

Endeavour from landing with the former residents of the international
space station.</LD>
<LD>   The delay added a 183rd day in orbit for U.S. astronaut Peggy
Whitson and her two cosmonaut crewmates -- and probably a 184th day,
given today's forecast.</LD>
<LD>   Mission Control said it would wait until today before deciding

<HD>Acrylamide Levels in Food Linked to Length of Time Spent
Cooking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ADELPHI, Md.</DL>
<LD>The longer French fries and certain other starchy foods are fried or
baked, the higher their level of a possible cancer-causing substance,
new federal research suggests.</LD>
<LD>   The substance, called acrylamide, made headlines last spring when
Swedish scientists discovered that it forms in fries, potato chips
and other high-carbohydrate foods cooked at high temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists in several other European countries confirmed the
Swedish discovery -- and now the latest batch of tests, made public
Wednesday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, shows that
acrylamide levels vary widely even within the same brand of food.</LD>
<TE>   FDA scientists bought French fries at four different Popeye's
restaurants and found a threefold difference between the batches with
the highest and lowest acrylamide levels. In tests of 25 seemingly
identical bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, only two bags contained
the same acrylamide level.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide forms during traditional cooking methods -- whether a
person buys ready-made food or fries or bakes from raw ingredients in
his or her own kitchen -- and it seems that the longer certain foods
are cooked at especially high temperatures, the more acrylamide
appears.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide causes cancer in test animals, but has never been
proved to do so in people -- meaning no one knows if higher levels in
one food than another are a problem.</TE>
<TE>   FDA scientists stressed that there is no reason for Americans to
start avoiding certain foods for fear of acrylamide, a message echoed
by the food and restaurant industries.</TE>
<TE>   Because acrylamide forms during traditional cooking methods,
dietary exposure "is something that's been going on a long time,"
said FDA senior scientist Bernard Schwetz.</TE>

<HD>Cop Cleared of Murder Charge; Heart Ailment Killed His Wife</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MAYS LANDING, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A police officer accused of suffocating his wife last year was
cleared Wednesday after medical experts determined that the woman
died of a rare heart ailment.</LD>
<LD>   "How could I be any happier? Now, we can do what we should have
been able to do from day one, which is mourn the passing of my wife,"
Officer James Andros III said.</LD>
<LD>   Andros, 34, found the body of his wife, Ellen, 31, when he came
home from a night of drinking with friends.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who did this to me, may God forgive them," he said.
"I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure these people are
exposed for what they've done."</TE>
<TE>   The 12-year veteran of the Atlantic City Police Department was
charged with murder after Assistant Atlantic County Medical Examiner
Elliot Gross concluded Ellen Andros had been smothered.</TE>
<TE>   But a forensic expert who reviewed the evidence for defense
attorneys concluded that she suffered bleeding in the coronary
artery, which closed from the pressure and caused her heart to stop
beating. The ailment, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, occurs
primarily in young women with no history of heart problems, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Gross was shown the findings, he agreed with them and said he
would correct Andros' death certificate, prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz
said. A judge dismissed the murder charge Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Professor Ends Talk of a Princeton Coup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. put an end to a widely watched
academic tug-of-war Wednesday, announcing he would remain as head of
Harvard University's black studies department rather than follow two
prominent colleagues to Princeton.</LD>
<LD>   "This is for good," Gates said. "It's to rest. It's final."</LD>
<LD>   Professors Cornel West and K. Anthony Appiah were lured away by
Princeton earlier this year. West left after a dispute with new
Harvard President Lawrence Summers.</LD>
<TE>   Gates, who is chair of Harvard's Afro-American studies program and
director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research,
said that he had talked extensively with Summers since West left.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been talking heart-to-heart," Gates said. "I'm absolutely
persuaded that he sees Afro-American studies as fundamental to the
intellectual life of a great university."</TE>
<TE>   Gates' plans had been the subject of widespread speculation among
observers who wondered whether Princeton would lure Harvard's entire
black studies "dream team."</TE>
<TE>   "It was very tempting to join Anthony Appiah and Cornel West,"
Gates said. "They're my two best friends in the academy, and they're
two great scholars, and Princeton now has virtually overnight become
one of the three great centers of African American studies."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the Harvard department was in transition.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be irresponsible of me to leave at this time," he said.</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Education Gap Could Be Closing</HD>
<DH>Number of foreign-born Latinos finishing high school has
doubled in 30 years, study says. They are improving faster than
U.S.-born group.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The percentage of adult Latino immigrants with high-school diplomas
has doubled in the last three decades, an indication that the
education gap between such immigrants and native-born Americans could
narrow, according to a new study from the Pew Hispanic Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Pew, a Washington, D.C.-based arm of USC, tabulated Census
Bureau survey data of adults ages 25 and older from 1970 to 2000 to
make its findings. The study struck an optimistic note, emphasizing
that the educational profiles of the Latino foreign-born are
improving faster than those of native-born Americans of all
ethnicities, although gaps remain, especially on college degrees.</LD>
<LD>   B. Lindsay Lowell, Pew's research director and the study's primary
author, said the data should counter any claims, made by some
advocates of more immigration restrictions, that the education level
of the Latino immigrant population is falling behind that of the
U.S.-born.</LD>
<TE>   "In the coming decades, the educational composition of the Latino
foreign-born population will begin to look more like that of the
American native-born population," the report says. "Policymakers can
feel confident that what seemed to be overwhelming problems
associated with the past low levels of immigrant education are
becoming surmountable."</TE>
<TE>   The report concedes that much of the potential for "gap closing"
reflects the stagnant growth in education levels among native-born
Americans, nearly 90% of whom have at least a high school education.
That figure offers little room for improvement, the study says.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the percentage of Latino immigrants who have at
least a high school education has more than doubled, from 28% to
nearly 59%.</TE>
<TE>   In earning college degrees, however, Latino immigrants have not
been able to keep pace. While the share of U.S.-born Americans
completing college increased over 30 years from 17% to 35%, the
Latino foreign-born figure went from 9% to 17%.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell, a former director of the Institute for the Study of
International Migration at Georgetown University, said that although
the college figures represent a "challenge," he expects a long-term
narrowing of that gap in college statistics as well.</TE>
<TE>   That is because statistics for Latino immigrants, he said, are
weighed down by the large numbers of older immigrants, who often have
little education.</TE>
<TE>   Education levels for Latino immigrants as a whole will improve as
that older generation of immigrants dies off, the report says.</TE>

<HD>Opening Salvos Fired in Challenge of Campaign Law</HD>
<DH>Attorneys clash over the election reform measure curbing
financial contributions. The outcome is expected to affect politics
for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers clashed Wednesday in federal court on the first day of a
momentous case that will determine the fate of the new campaign
finance law and likely shape the fund-raising machinery of American
politics for years to come.</LD>
<LD>   Defenders said the law, which bans the unregulated contributions
to national political parties known as "soft money" and restricts
interest-group advertising, is a legitimate effort to clean up a
system besmirched by huge donations.</LD>
<LD>   Detractors called it an outrageous assault on political speech
that will cripple parties and hinder the rights of groups and
individuals to make their views heard.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is the future of the biggest overhaul of the campaign
finance system since the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s. After
years of discussion and debate, the Bipartisan Campaign Finance
Reform Act of 2002 won approval in Congress and became law with
President Bush's signature in March.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the signing, opponents filed suit to challenge the
law as unconstitutional. Eventually more than 80 plaintiffs joined
the case, including the California Democratic and Republican parties.</TE>
<TE>   The law's central provisions concerning soft money went into
effect on Nov. 6, the day after the midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, proponents argued in U.S. District Court that the
soft-money ban should remain.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is about a situation where corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals go to the parties to buy access based on the
money they give," said Roger M. Witten, an attorney for the law's
sponsors, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold
(D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   Asserting the need to fix what he called "a thoroughly broken
campaign finance system," Witten said there had been many instances
in recent years in which fund-raising was linked to legislative
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Describing a 1999 document from PhRMA, a pharmaceutical industry
association, Witten said the group planned to urge Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) to consider the industry's views and remember that
drug manufacturers had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to GOP
committees.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Abrams, an attorney for McConnell, who is the lead plaintiff
in the case, dismissed the charge, telling the court that the
senator's answer to the trade group, had such an incident occurred,
would have been: "They didn't ask anything and I didn't promise
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Other attorneys for plaintiffs said the soft-money ban should be
scrapped and parties allowed to raise as much money as any other
political player.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth W. Starr, who also represents McConnell, said the law
established a "dragnet of regulation" reaching from Washington deep
into state and local politics.</TE>
<TE>   California politics figured prominently in attacks on the law.
Starr cited a 1996 radio advertisement in the campaign against state
Proposition 209 -- an initiative that year to restrict affirmative
action programs -- as an example of the type of ad that could be
banned under the new rules. That's because the law restricts state
party spending on a range of activities that influence federal
elections, including efforts to bolster voter registration or
turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "This means that Congress has effectively federalized state and
local election activities," said Deborah Caplan, an attorney for the
California parties.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments in the case known as McConnell vs. Federal Election
Commission displayed an all-star cast of legal talent.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the team opposed to the law was Starr, the former
independent counsel in the investigation of Whitewater, a failed
Arkansas real estate venture that involved President Clinton and
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Starr was joined by an array of
1st Amendment specialists and lawyers for the American Civil
Liberties Union, the National Rifle Assn., the AFL-CIO and other
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Those supporting the legislation included Seth P. Waxman, a
solicitor general in the Clinton administration, and lawyers for the
Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   After two days of oral arguments conclude today, a special
three-judge panel is expected to rule in coming weeks. While an
appeal of that decision appears certain no matter which side
prevails, the trial court record will help frame the case for the
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, the case will go straight to the high court for an
expedited review, expected to occur next year. The court could uphold
the law, strike it down or invalidate parts of it and allow the rest
to stand.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the court battle resumed a debate that has consumed
Congress for years: Is big money a blessing or a bane in national
politics? The law says mainly the latter.</TE>
<TE>   It prohibits the national parties and, with certain limited
exceptions, federal officeholders and candidates from raising soft
money -- a form of political finance that came into vogue in the late
1980s and 1990s as a way to avoid federal contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   Those limits affect donations made directly to candidates from
individuals and political action committees. Under federal law, only
those regulated funds, known as "hard money," may be spent on
advertising that urges voters to elect or defeat a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Soft money, on the other hand, is much easier to raise and has
often been used by parties to pay for issue-oriented advertisements
that seek to influence voters' perceptions of candidates while
avoiding language that would cross the line of express advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   Many voters would recognize soft-money ads on television by this
type of ending: "Call Senator X and tell her ...."</TE>
<TE>   The law also bans certain types of broadcast advertising by
outside interest groups in the 30 days before a primary or 60 days
before a general election.</TE>
<TE>   All of these measures are billed by advocates as steps to limit
the appearance of corruption caused by contributions of $100,000 or
more to politicians and their allies from donors -- including
individuals, corporations and unions -- who may have business in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Trying the case are Judges Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and Richard J.
Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and
Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit. Kollar-Kotelly is a Clinton appointee; Henderson was
appointed by the first President Bush and Leon by the second.</TE>
<TE>   Leon and Henderson grilled the lawyers repeatedly with questions
about the law's scope. During the arguments, the panel saw videotapes
of issue ads that had aired in campaigns in recent years -- ads
advocates of the law said had been rigged to avoid federal campaign
rules and that opponents said were constitutionally protected free
speech.</TE>
<TE>   Before the arguments began, the judges received thousands of pages
of briefs, interviews, records and affidavits.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Cons Exiled to Outskirts</HD>
<DH>Iowa sex offenders, forbidden to live within 2,000 feet of
schools and child care centers, must crowd into pockets of desolate
housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WATERLOO, Iowa</DL>
<LD>From the window of his stifling room, Kevin Zahnd sees nothing but a
gravel parking lot, an empty road and a few trees, straggly from the
frost.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, it's just as barren. The mattress he sleeps on is
prison-cell thin. His closet is a garbage bag. His recliner is
broken. As is his alarm clock. He has no phone. He does have a TV, a
banged-up Zenith, though the picture wavers. Above it, on the stucco
wall, hangs a rough unframed painting of a mountain, in three shades
of drab.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Zahnd turned 24 in this room last week. He says he likes
living here, in a residential motel so desolate it doesn't have a
name, in a cramped room that costs more than a decent apartment
downtown. "It's quiet," he explains. "It's near the river."</LD>
<TE>   More to the point: It's one of the few places in town where Zahnd
can live legally.</TE>
<TE>   A new Iowa law -- one of the toughest in the nation -- prohibits
any sex offender who has victimized a minor from living within 2,000
feet, or roughly six city blocks, of a school or child-care center.</TE>
<TE>   The law has effectively exiled hundreds of child molesters,
pedophiles, porn photographers and rapists to ragged hideaways on the
outskirts of town. "They're colonizing us," muttered Kenny
Rhodenbaugh, 43, convicted of sexual assault on his sons' teenage
baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Iowa City -- the state's third-largest urban center --
just one block is open to sex offenders. In Dubuque, virtually all
the affordable apartments are off limits; only the stately homes on
the golf course are legal. Nearly all of Des Moines is out of bounds,
including the homeless shelters. Many rural towns are closed as well
because the 2,000-foot rule applies to home day-cares as well as
commercial centers.</TE>
<TE>   And in the industrial city of Waterloo (pop. 64,000), offenders
like Zahnd -- who was convicted of sexual abuse for impregnating a
13-year-old -- have little choice other than two residential motels
with bare-bones furnishings, both miles from the nearest bus stops.</TE>
<TE>   Banished from the homes of the few relatives who still support
them, forced to live far from their jobs and their counselors, the
sex offenders fume.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't make drunk drivers live 2,000 feet from the nearest bar.
Shoplifters are not forced to live 2,000 feet from the nearest mall,"
said Ken Shadlow, 37, who spent five years behind bars for taking
nude photos of two teenage girls. He is now in a halfway house in
Waterloo, unable to find a place of his own to live legally.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, my offense was despicable," Shadlow said. "But now I can't go
and stay with my own parents, in the house where I grew up?"</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jerry Behn, who proposed the law, has little sympathy:
"These people are predators," he said. "If this law creates a
hardship for them, that doesn't bother me."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, the number of imprisoned sex offenders
has surged an average of 7% a year. No other category of violent
criminal has grown as fast. Researchers estimate that anywhere from
10% to 40% of child molesters will abuse again. Yet most sexual
offenders are eventually released from prison.</TE>
<TE>   Such statistics scare parents. And that fear breeds innovation --
ever stricter, ever broader, ever more aggressive legislation to hold
predators at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts warn that a legal crackdown can never be as effective
as treating offenders with counseling and educating children about
how to stay safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these laws respond to community anxieties, but I'm
inclined to think they don't help that much," said David Finkelhor, a
sexual abuse authority at the University of New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "People think if we just had tougher laws, that would solve the
problem of child molestation, but it won't," added Dr. Gene Abel, an
Atlanta psychiatrist who treats pedophiles. "Child molesters don't
molest because children happen to be nearby. Most have an ongoing
sexual interest in children. Legislating to try to change that ...
just doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the laws draw broad support -- often under the theory, voiced
by one Iowa school attorney, that any barriers the state can
establish to impede predators "can't hurt and may help."</TE>
<TE>   All states now require sex offenders to register their addresses
with police. In at least 20 states, authorities notify residents
about their new neighbor's past crimes. In Iowa, sex offenders often
find their photographs printed in the newspaper, tacked up at the
local bar, even tucked into students' book bags.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen states subject the most dangerous sexual predators to
"chemical castration," a regimen of drugs designed to keep their
libidos in check. Others permit judges to order violent offenders
detained indefinitely after their prison terms end.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Texas, several jurisdictions outfit sex offenders with
high-tech devices that track their movements by satellite, setting
off alarms that alert law enforcement if they approach a school or
playground. Illinois is testing a "Cyber Sentinel" program to monitor
Internet use; if a pedophile types phrases often used to woo kids
online, probation officers are instantly alerted.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa requires regular polygraphs to make sure former inmates are
behaving. Here in Black Hawk County, sex offenders are also subjected
to arousal tests that measure whether they continue to be attracted
to children as they undergo therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Residency restriction is the latest trend.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa's law is modeled on a tough Alabama statute that forbids sex
offenders to live or work within 2,000 feet of schools and day cares.
Within the last two years, California, Illinois, Kentucky and
Louisiana have passed laws similar in concept, though far less
restrictive. (California's, for instance, applies only to the most
violent predators, and blocks them only from living within a
quarter-mile of an elementary school.)</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa, the law was overwhelmingly supported, drawing just two
dissenting votes in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Sex offenders already living near schools or day-care centers when
the law took effect in July are not required to move. Those living
under 24-hour supervision in medical facilities or halfway houses are
exempt as well. But the restrictions apply to several hundred
offenders released on parole each year, and hundreds of others put on
probation. Because they remain under judicial supervision, few are
allowed to leave the state.</TE>
<TE>   If they do not find a legal home, they can be returned to prison,
for as long as two years.</TE>
<TE>   That satisfies Mary Peterson, who runs a day care in downtown
Waterloo. She posts photographs of local sex offenders in her office,
near her Halloween collage of toddling princesses and superheroes.
New alerts arrive all too often. So Peterson is glad for whatever
protection the 2,000-foot law affords.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense," she said, as her young charges napped in a
darkened church basement.</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby Catholic school, Principal Julie Niemeyer started to
agree. Then she hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm torn," she said. The impulse to push predators far from her
students is strong. So too, though, is the impulse to give them a
chance -- to give them their freedom, now that they have done their
time.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're trying to make something better of themselves, you
hate to tell them, 'Do it somewhere else, not next to me,' " Niemeyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Critics of Law</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Iowa law -- and there are many -- raise other
objections as well.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that the stereotypical pedophile, lurking by the
playground in hopes of snatching a child, accounts for very few
crimes. More than 80% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone
who knows the victim -- a relative, a neighbor, a friend, a trusted
teacher, coach or priest. They worry that the 2,000-foot "buffer"
will give parents a false sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to know that there are sex offenders among us, that
they're in every community," said Patty Wetterling, who became a
child-protection activist after her son Jacob was abducted off his
bike in St. Joseph, Minn., in 1989, never to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also note the absurdities built into the Iowa law. Take
the case of Shadlow, convicted of exploiting two minors.</TE>
<TE>   A muscular man who used to run his own audio store, Shadlow gets
regular furloughs from the halfway house in Waterloo to play with his
five kids at his parents' home. He's allowed to be there all day,
even as toddlers come and go from a child-care center three blocks
away. But by law, he can't sleep there at night, when the day care is
closed.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we really focusing on crime with these laws, or are we just
placating the public?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, police and prosecutors in Iowa are posing that same
question.</TE>
<TE>   "The attitude [among lawmakers] is, castrate them, poke their eyes
out, whatever you do, it's OK, because they're sex offenders. But
this law protects nobody. It just causes enormous headaches for law
enforcement," said Fred McCaw, president of Iowa's district attorney
association.</TE>
<TE>   So far, just a handful of offenders have been charged with living
in restricted zones. One young man was arrested for illegally living
with his parents. A second defendant faces a court appearance in
January but is having trouble reaching his lawyer; the only legal
residence he could find after his arrest was a camper in the woods,
with no phone or mail service.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw says openly that he hopes the arrests will provoke the
defense bar into challenging the residency restrictions as
unconstitutional. And indeed, the Iowa Civil Liberties Union is
considering such a move. If it takes the case, it will have no
shortage of plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-convicts speak fiercely about the law, saying it has branded
them unworthy to reenter society.</TE>
<TE>   "This law treats you as if you ain't going to change," said
Alfred, a 23-year-old who would not give his last name. "It makes you
want to re-offend."</TE>
<TE>   Alfred, imprisoned for having sex with a 13-year-old girl he met
in a bar, insists he is not the type of predator who needs to be
isolated. He and others point out that Iowa's statute makes no
distinctions: A lifelong pedophile is treated no differently than an
adult-theater operator who lets a minor into an X-rated movie or a
high school senior convicted of statutory rape for consensual
intimacy with his 15-year-old girlfriend. There is no provision for a
judge or a parole officer to evaluate whether the offender remains
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys in other states have challenged the constitutionality of
treating all sex offenders alike. The issue is now pending before the
U.S. Supreme Court; the justices must decide whether it's legal for a
state to post online personal information about every sex offender
without first assessing which individuals pose an ongoing threat.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Iowa, some attorneys consider the lack of individual
evaluations the most troubling aspect of the new residency law. Sex
offenders agree. Indeed, some former inmates would argue that the law
shouldn't be scrapped altogether -- just refined, so it applies only
to the worst predators.</TE>
<TE>   Though they demand freedom to settle where they want, sex
offenders admit that there are, among them, a few who do not deserve
that right. Some confess that they will not take their children to
the motels where they're forced to live -- because they're full of
sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "No place for a kid to grow up," said one motel resident, on
probation for fondling a young girl.</TE>
<TE>   At the halfway house in downtown Waterloo, a pudgy 51-year-old
with a drooping handlebar mustache is attending his first counseling
class after a decade in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He complains that the residency restriction is unfair. He says he
deserves a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   Asked his crime, the man says, "Sex with a minor." The minor was
4. She was his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   He is asked to consider the law again: Would you want someone with
your record living next to your daughter's school?</TE>
<TE>   The man bends his head so low, his mustache brushes his T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he whispers, his voice almost inaudible. Then, a bit louder,
he says again: "No."</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Born Terror Plot Suspect Allowed Lawyer</HD>
<DH>But the same district court ruling upholds the
administration view that Jose Padilla can be held uncharged as an
enemy combatant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano and John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a ruling hailed as a victory by both sides, a federal judge
Wednesday said the government is lawfully detaining Jose Padilla as
an enemy combatant in the war on terror, but at the same time allowed
his defense attorney to meet with the "dirty bomb" plot suspect and
begin mounting a court challenge seeking his release.</LD>
<LD>   For the Bush administration, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey
declared that Padilla's continued lockdown inside the military brig
at a naval base in South Carolina is constitutional and "is not, per
se, unlawful."</LD>
<LD>   "The president is authorized under the Constitution and by law to
direct the military to detain enemy combatants," he ruled.</LD>
<TE>   For the defense, the judge found that Padilla's New York attorney,
Donna R. Newman, who until now has been blocked from speaking with
her client, has the right to meet with the American-born Padilla and
begin mounting a legal challenge to government allegations that Al
Qaeda terrorist leaders sent him back to the United States to scout
targets for detonating a radioactive bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "On the facts presented in this case, the balance weighs heavily
in Padilla's favor," the judge said in ordering the military to allow
Newman access to her client in Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides quickly claimed victory, even as they await the larger
legal battle over whether the government can hold Padilla longer --
perhaps even until the war's end, as the Bush White House has
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the case is that, unlike the other enemy combatants
scooped up on the battlefields in Afghanistan, Padilla, 32, was
arrested by the FBI when he returned to Chicago last May.</TE>
<TE>   Another American-born detainee, Yaser Esam Hamdi, is being held as
an enemy combatant in a military lockup in Norfolk, Va. A Saudi
national, the Louisiana-born Hamdi lived in the United States only
for a short time and was picked up in Afghanistan by the U.S.
military.</TE>
<TE>   "In times of war, the president must be able to protect our nation
from those who join with our enemies to harm innocent Americans,"
said Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock. "The president
must have the authority to act when an individual associated with our
nation's enemies enters our country to endanger American lives."</TE>
<TE>   Holding alleged terrorists as enemy combatants for lengthy and
indefinite periods of time, she added, "is an important tool in the
war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Newman, on the other hand, noted that the long-expected, 102-page
ruling upholds Padilla's U.S.-given right to legal representation and
clears the way for her to go back to Judge Mukasey and ask for her
client's release -- if she can prove he was not a terrorist but
simply returning to America to visit relatives.</TE>
<TE>   So far, she said, "we're happy with the results, certainly. It's a
significant decision, a lengthy decision and a thorough one. It's
making something happen, not just this waiting and waiting."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 30, Newman and government lawyers are to confer with
Mukasey for setting up parameters for her initial visit with Padilla.
In contrast, about 600 war captives being held at the U.S. naval base
on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have not been allowed legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Newman has been told that there is no guarantee that
even her mail to Padilla would get through.</TE>
<TE>   A high school dropout, the Brooklyn-born Padilla spent much of his
youth as a Chicago gangbanger; he eventually served time as a
juvenile in connection with a murder case there, and later was
incarcerated for a year in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for shooting at a
motorist during a road rage incident.</TE>
<TE>   But upon his release in 1992, he seemed to want to settle down. He
married, became a father and began studying Islam. In fact, he became
so wrapped up in his new religion that he changed his name to
Abdullah al Muhajir and left for Egypt, where he told friends and
family he hoped to teach.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested on May 8 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport
after flying from Pakistan via Switzerland. He was held as a material
witness for the New York federal grand jury investigating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But on June 9, President Bush issued a written declaration
officially naming Padilla an enemy combatant. He was switched to
military custody and moved to Charleston. He has not been formally
charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   In support of that declaration, the administration released an
affidavit from Michael H. Mobbs, a special advisor to the Department
of Defense, outlining some of its evidence against Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said Padilla became "closely associated" with Al
Qaeda and at one point approached them about conducting terrorist
operations in this country. Mobbs said the terrorists researched how
to build a "uranium-enhanced explosive device." He said the plan
called for radioactive material to be stolen in the U.S. and for
Padilla to be sent back here to "conduct reconnaissance."</TE>
<TE>   It is the Mobbs' affidavit that Newman, through consultations with
Padilla, must challenge legally if she hopes to have the Bush
declaration against him dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   But she has already told the judge, in her own affidavit, that she
knew of no evidence that he was indeed returning to harm America.
Rather, she said, he "traveled to Chicago to visit with his son," and
he then "planned to travel to Florida to visit other members of his
family."</TE>
<TE>   But there also is a second Mobbs affidavit, which has not been
released, but which purportedly provides more details about Padilla's
alleged role in a dirty-bomb scheme.</TE>
<TE>   However, the judge said he will decide later whether to review
that affidavit, depending on how Newman goes about seeking to have
the Bush declaration against Padilla thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Yet so far, the judge indicated, the government is within its
powers to hold Padilla incommunicado as with other unlawful
combatants.</TE>
<TE>   "Their detention for the duration of hostilities is supportable --
logically and legally -- on the same ground that the detention of
prisoners of war is supportable: to prevent them from rejoining the
enemy," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene R. Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military
Justice in Washington, said the ruling "is probably a pyrrhic victory
for Padilla."</TE>
<TE>   "He has a judicial blessing for lawyer contact and lawyer
assistance. The judge has indicated the courthouse door is at least
open a crack for the Padillas of the world," Fidell said. "Of course,
there aren't many Padillas of the world, and it is only open a
crack."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Goldman, president of the National Assn. of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, said that the judge's ruling makes clear that the
government cannot "willy-nilly" deny basic rights to American
citizens without there being some legal challenge available.</TE>
<TE>   "If, in fact, Padilla has committed a crime, we have a whole
criminal justice system to deal with it," he said.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hears Challenge to Miranda</HD>
<DH>In Oxnard case, justices voice surprise at claim that it's
OK to question unwilling suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Several Supreme Court justices expressed surprise Wednesday when
lawyers for the Bush administration and the Oxnard police asserted
that officers are free to press unwilling suspects and witnesses to
talk, as long as their forced confessions are not used in a trial.</LD>
<LD>   The arguments came in the case of a farm worker who was shot five
times during an encounter with Oxnard police and then pressed in the
hospital to admit he had grabbed an officer's gun.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether the law forbids "coercive questioning" by the
police.</LD>
<TE>   The Constitution and the right against self-incrimination do not
put "a direct limitation on the conduct of law enforcement officers,"
Deputy U.S. Solicitor Gen. Paul Clement told the court.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oxnard case, the police supervisor did not violate any
right by questioning the gravely wounded man in the emergency room,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's extraordinary. So there isn't any constitutional
violation?" asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. "So you could lock him
for five days, and you say there's no violation?"</TE>
<TE>   No, not a "complete constitutional violation," Clement replied.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Amendment "safeguards the integrity of the trial process,"
he said, so it would violate his rights only if the suspect's words
were used against him in court.</TE>
<TE>   "I acknowledge there was coercion in this case. We don't blanch
from that," said attorney Lawrence Robbins, representing the Oxnard
police.</TE>
<TE>   "We can win this case the hard way or the easy way. I want to win
it the hard way," he added, by winning a ruling that says that
coercive police questioning does not violate the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The easy way, he said, would be to have the court rule that since
the law is not clear, Sgt. Ben Chavez cannot be sued for his 1997
emergency-room questioning of Oliverio Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Though left blinded and paralyzed, Martinez survived and sued
Oxnard police, including Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important we not torture the language of the 5th Amendment
because of a concern the police would engage in torture," Robbins
argued.</TE>
<TE>   Because the 5th Amendment says no one shall be "compelled in a
criminal case to be a witness against himself," the police cannot
violate this right, he said. Only prosecutors in the courtroom can do
that, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it your view is that if a police officer quite
deliberately violates the person's Miranda rights, he never commits a
[constitutional] violation," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Robbins responded.</TE>
<TE>   "So, following Miranda is not an obligation of the police
officer?" she inquired further.</TE>
<TE>   No, he replied, although a suspect's incriminating statements
cannot be used in court.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say this is a crucial issue daily for police.</TE>
<TE>   So-called Miranda rights were created by a Supreme Court ruling in
a 1960s case, Miranda vs. Arizona, in which Chief Justice Earl Warren
wrote that because police questioning is inherently coercive,
officers must warn suspects of their rights before questioning
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Warren's opinion and the others that have followed described the
Miranda warnings as limitations on the police, and all along, some
lawyers and law professors have questioned whether they are a
constitutional requirement.</TE>
<TE>   If today's court decides that the Miranda rules are constitutional
rights, then officers will have to stop questioning people who invoke
their right to remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   However, if they are not constitutional rights, officers will be
able to pressure unwilling people to make them talk and then use the
information or evidence they reveal against them.</TE>
<TE>   George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg, an
expert on criminal law, said police in many areas have come to
realize they can ignore the Miranda rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that people know about Miranda from TV and think
they have these rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police often know better, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the police, it pays to read people their rights," Saltzburg
said. "But it also pays for them to violate the rights if they refuse
to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Officers can learn about key evidence against a suspect, even if
they cannot use their confessions against them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that the case heard Wednesday, Chavez vs. Martinez,
is likely to make clear that police are free to violate the Miranda
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The justices wondered how far officers can go in pressing people
to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose [the officer] beats him up to get him to talk. Not to use
the statements against him in court, but to get information. Is there
any constitutional violation?" asked Justice John Paul Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   That would not violate his right against self-incrimination,
Clement replied, but the victim could sue the police for the beating.</TE>
<TE>   In their briefs, the Justice Department and the Oxnard Police
Department say "shocking" police conduct, such as beatings and
torture, could violate the Constitution's guarantee of "due process
of law."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles lawyer R. Samuel Paz, representing Martinez, urged the
court to uphold the rulings of judges in California who said the
Oxnard police violated the rights of the badly wounded man.</TE>
<TE>   In the emergency room, "Mr. Martinez twice said, 'Leave me alone.
Leave me alone. I'm dying.' No reasonable police officer would think
continued questioning in that circumstance is appropriate," Paz said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said people should have a right against coercive police
questioning, even if they are not charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "A person like Mr. Martinez, who was not charged with any crime,
would have no remedy," he said, for rough treatment in police
custody.</TE>
<TE>   "Persons in this country should still be allowed the dignity to
say: 'I don't want to speak,' " he said.</TE>

<HD>Snow and Ice Hit From Texas to Virginia</HD>
<DH>Bad weather, slippery roads contribute to at least two
deaths in Kentucky and one in Tennessee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Thousands of students stayed home from school Wednesday as a storm
spread ice and as much as a foot of snow from the Texas Panhandle to
Virginia, making roads slippery and knocking out power to thousands
of people.</LD>
<LD>   Slippery roads were blamed for at least two deaths in Kentucky
traffic accidents, and ice contributed to one death in Tennessee,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nasty -- sleet, snow, freezing rain, a little bit of
everything," said Shari Clapp with the Kentucky State Police.</LD>
<TE>   Snow fell from the Texas Panhandle to the central Appalachians in
southwestern Virginia. Only a few inches hit most areas, but nearly a
foot piled up in the Oklahoma Panhandle, and trees and power lines
were coated with ice statewide.</TE>
<TE>   In the Appalachians, the Blue Ridge Parkway was shut down in North
Carolina. Snow was a foot deep on a section of the parkway, National
Park Service spokeswoman Pansy Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Schools were closed in nearly a dozen states, including Oklahoma,
Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, the
Carolinas and Virginia. Some Georgia schools closed in anticipation
of icy roads.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100,000 students were sent home early by North
Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, and South Carolina Gov. Jim
Hodges told state agency heads to let workers go home early in 22
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses also closed early. "Some of us have to drive 20
miles to get home, and it would be nice to get there before the worst
of this hits," said Debbie Martin of Gainesville, about 50 miles
northeast of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   About 37,000 homes and businesses were blacked out in Oklahoma,
utility officials said. Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin declared 42 of the
state's 77 counties disaster emergency areas.</TE>
<TE>   About 56,000 homes and businesses had no electricity in northern
Arkansas, and utilities said it might be Saturday before some people
got service back.</TE>

<HD>It's a Grand Old Party for Thurmond as He Turns 100 and
Leaves the Senate</HD>
<DH>South Carolina's favorite son has outlived his
segregationist past, and today he is celebrated for his seniority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There will be a big birthday cake with 100 candles blazing on Capitol
Hill, assuming the fire marshal approves. There will be tubs of
butter pecan ice cream -- his favorite -- testimonials by Senate
luminaries, a mountain of cards and a bundle of balloons set aloft.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina turns one century old today.
He is the oldest and longest-serving member of the U.S. Senate, a man
who had but two goals in recent years: live to be 100 and finish a
record eight terms.</LD>
<LD>   He managed to pull off both despite infirmity and a political
resume that boasts little more than his failed effort to keep the
South segregated. Nevertheless, he will be joyously feted, his
defiance of time marked by his pumpkin orange hair, his racist past a
dim memory.</LD>
<TE>   "You want to be sensitive to the elderly but I don't think we
ought to ignore the history here," said Ferrel Guillory, a political
analyst specializing in Southern politics at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in Edgefield, S.C., where Thurmond was born, enough cake to
feed all 2,500 residents will sit on a great big table in front of a
great big statue of the senator in bronze, facing south. The Strom
Thurmond High School chorus will sing. Birthday cards from
schoolchildren will hang from Christmas trees.</TE>
<TE>   But Thurmond won't be there -- his little sister Mary, 92, will
attempt to blow out the candles for him. The senator has opted to
stay in Washington, attending the party held in the same office
building where he once wrestled a colleague to the ground to prevent
him from casting a committee vote on legislation he didn't like.</TE>
<TE>   Some say he's staying in town to ensure he completes the term,
which doesn't officially end until January, even though the Senate
has already adjourned. Indeed, he brought it to a close himself Nov.
20, helped by aides to the podium where he struggled to remember the
traditional lines, banged the gavel, then added his own gravelly
postscript to a nearly half-century run: "That's all."</TE>
<TE>   Home-State Hero</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina he is a hero, in Washington he is an icon. His
political longevity says as much about the South as the Senate -- the
former bound by a code of gentility that refused to push an elder out
the door, the latter cocooned in a world where seniority trumps
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Born while Theodore Roosevelt was president, James Strom Thurmond
married for the first time in 1947 but his wife, Jean, died 13 years
later. In 1968, he married his second wife, Nancy, a former Miss
South Carolina 44 years his junior. A father of four, he was in his
60s before his first child was born; she was killed by a drunk driver
in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Thurmond prided himself on keeping physically fit and
was known to go so far as to stand on his head to impress a woman.
Now separated from Nancy, he has been living in a suite at Walter
Reed Army Hospital the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond embodies an era of American politics that is not exactly
proud. Much of his early career was built on resisting the civil
rights movement, when he famously declared: "There's not enough
troops in the Army to break down segregation and admit Negroes into
our homes, our theaters and our swimming pools."</TE>
<TE>   His most memorable Senate moment came in 1957 when he dehydrated
his body in a steam bath to avoid trips to the men's room, then spent
24 hours and 18 minutes unsuccessfully filibustering a watered-down
civil rights bill.</TE>
<TE>   "He was basically a segregationist, most of it framed in states'
rights language. That was a widely supported view throughout most of
the white South, especially South Carolina," said Hastings Wyman, a
Southern political analyst who once worked as Thurmond's legislative
assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "He represented a state that had views at variance with the rest
of the nation for several centuries. Those views have been applauded
among his constituents but have been the subject of enormous
criticism in much of the rest of the country."</TE>
<TE>   For many years that meant leading the resistance as the South was
pulled kicking and screaming into an era of civil rights. In 1948,
while governor of South Carolina, Thurmond bolted from the Democratic
Party to run against Harry S. Truman as a Dixiecrat -- a breakaway
party dedicated to ending "social intermingling of the races."</TE>
<TE>   He railed against Lyndon B. Johnson's Civil Rights Act of 1964
that integrated restaurants and hotels, calling it "the worst, most
unreasonable and unconstitutional" legislation ever considered by
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   That same year he switched to the GOP, making it newly acceptable
to be a Republican in the South and paving the way for other Southern
Democrats to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Then, by all appearances, Thurmond changed. He became the first
Southern senator to hire a black man to his staff, signaling
conservative Southern holdouts that it was time to relent.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it respectable for white conservatives to move into the
biracial arena," Wyman said. "If Thurmond could do it, we all could
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond never became a great advocate of civil rights, but he
dropped his obstructionist ways. He never renounced his past either.
But his gesture, however small, made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying he made the state move forward, but he put the
icing on the cake. And it needed to be done," Wyman said.</TE>
<TE>   After that, most analysts have concluded, Thurmond didn't do much
to influence national policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no great Thurmond Act or Thurmond Amendment," analyst
Guillory said. "He's known more for his longevity and his stand
against civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   But he paid his constituents the attentions of an eager suitor,
scanning the obituaries to send condolences to widows, congratulating
high school graduates, changing unfavorable military discharges to
favorable ones. He brought home the requisite pork. The people of
South Carolina responded by pinning his name to a dam, a lake and
scads of buildings while faithfully re-upping his term every six
years.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 93 and wanted an eighth term, polls showed a majority
of his constituents would prefer he retire. But in a grand act of
Southern hospitality -- or maybe, as some historians pose, because
South Carolina still has a toe in its sullied past -- they overlooked
his infirmity, the widely known secret that his chief of staff was
effectively the acting senator, and granted his wish.</TE>
<TE>   And today his birthday will be honored in two places, the nation's
capital and the home in Edgefield where Thurmond will return in
January to live in a special suite set up in a wing of the county
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond leaves behind more than 16,000 votes, more than 700,000
answered constituent requests and an ignominious past that, on this
birthday at least, nobody will mention. Indeed, President Bush wished
him a happy birthday, praising "his values, and his good works."</TE>
<TE>   "It tells you it pays to live a long time and be around long
enough to spin your own legend," said James Pinkerton, a Republican
analyst in Washington. He recalled former Mississippi Sen. Theodore
Bilbo, who served with Thurmond and called for Congress to deport
blacks to Africa. Bilbo died in 1947 and went down in history as a
shameless racist.</TE>
<TE>   "But Thurmond lived another 50 years," Pinkerton said, "and had a
chance to call it youthful indiscretion, over-eagerness, and go on to
be a respected elder statesman."</TE>
<TE>   And today, it will be left at that.</TE>

<CX>   Thurmond --  An article in Thursday's Section A about the 100th
birthday of Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) incorrectly said that
Thurmond served in Congress with former Mississippi Sen. Theodore
Bilbo, who was in the Senate from 1935 until his death in 1947.
Thurmond's tenure in the Senate did not begin until 1954, when he was
elected as a write-in candidate.</CX>

<HD>Of Mice and Men: We're Quite Similar, Genetically</HD>
<DH>Scientists complete map of the rodent's genome, which is
hailed as an essential research tool.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been squeaking around us for millenniums, reviled as a
disease-spreading pest or cherished as a collector's curiosity and a
powerful scientific tool.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the common laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, has scurried out
of its hole to show us what it's made of. An international consortium
of scientists announced today in the journal Nature that it has
completed a sophisticated draft of the mouse genome, and has
published the first detailed comparison of the genetic codes of mouse
and man.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists heralded the advance as every bit as important, if not
more, as the decoding of the human genome because of the mouse's
critical role in biomedical research.</LD>
<TE>   As it turns out, mice and humans aren't that different. Both
species have about 30,000 genes, although the full mouse genome is
about 15% smaller. Very few of the genes -- less than 1% -- are
unique to either species. Humans even possess the same set of mouse
genes that direct the formation of a tail.</TE>
<TE>   The mouse genome adds an important set of data to the human genome
and the genomes of other key research species, such as yeast, fruit
flies and roundworms.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say it will ease the ability to tackle medically
important or just plain fascinating questions such as how bodies are
built, how they decay and die, how diseases are caused, and how to
prevent or cure them.</TE>
<TE>   The advance is also crucial because having a blueprint from
another mammal helps scientists extract meaning from the human
genome's vast code. By directly comparing these two genomes,
scientists can deduce which parts are important and which are
seemingly useless filler that can mutate and change at will.</TE>
<TE>   "Having sequenced the human genome is all well and good," said
Eric Lander, director of the Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome
Research, one of the institutes that sequenced the mouse genome.</TE>
<TE>   But "the mouse provides us for the first time with the ability to
turn the spotlight on what matters, and what probably doesn't matter,
in the human genome."</TE>
<TE>   The sequencing of the mouse genome was conducted by scientists of
the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium at the Whitehead/MIT
Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, and the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute in
Hinxton, England. Researchers from 21 institutes around the world
contributed to the analysis published today. The draft sequence
covers 96% of the genome. Full completion is expected in the next few
years.</TE>
<TE>   A private company, Celera Genomics, has offered a different mouse
genome sequence for a fee since 2001. But the availability now of a
free version that can be accessed on the Web is a treasure trove for
research, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   They have learned much already.</TE>
<TE>   The mouse genome has helped scientists identify 1,200 new human
genes -- and 9,000 new mouse genes. While the genes -- the key
strings of DNA that direct the formation and functioning of organisms
-- are largely the same in both species, the mouse has expanded
numbers of certain types, particularly those that are involved with
smell, reproduction and processing certain toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have also found that mouse and human genes tend to line
up in a similar order, although chromosomes have broken and rejoined
in all kinds of new patterns over the course of our separate
evolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are particularly enthralled by the finding that far
more than just the genes appear to be closely conserved between mouse
and human. The actual genes make up only 1.5% of the genome: the rest
consists of DNA that may be unimportant, involved in turning the
genes on and off or serving some other function.</TE>
<TE>   But fully 5% of the genome has been closely preserved for 75
million years, the time when mouse and human split off from their
last common ancestor. This percentage of preserved genetic
information suggests that far more than just the genes are important.</TE>
<TE>   Mice have long lived around human beings, and odd types with
exotic fur, small size or the tendency to "waltz" in circles were
bred and prized in Asia for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, "fancy" mouse breeding and collecting spawned a
"National Mouse Club" in Victorian England.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 20th century, Harvard University scientist William
Castle saw that mice also could be eminently useful in the
new-fangled science of genetics.</TE>
<TE>   Mouse science blossomed, and thousands of different strains of
mice are now studied. Scientists can delete or add genes to mice at
will, and thus figure out their function. Stem-cell science, with its
medical promise, got its start in mice. Mice have helped our
understanding of many human maladies, from obesity and heart defects
to hearing loss and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Mice have taught us most of what we know about disease," said
Jake Lusis, a UCLA professor of human genetics and microbiology who
uses mice to study heart disease and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   With the genome in hand, such findings are expected to come at a
much faster pace.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in two papers accompanying today's release,
scientists used the mouse genome to probe the genes connected with
Down syndrome, in which a baby is born with an extra chromosome 21.
They surveyed all the known genes on the mouse equivalent to that
chromosome to see how each one acted during mouse development. They
found genes that are active in the developing brain or heart at
crucial times, and thus might be key in the mental retardation and
heart abnormalities common with Down syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The mouse-human comparison may also help illuminate the very
process of evolution. Scientists don't yet understand what kinds of
genetic changes occur when creatures diverge from each other and form
new species with different bodies, behaviors and habits.</TE>
<TE>   They are intrigued by the fact that at least half of the mouse and
human genomes are wildly different from each other, stuffed with odd
DNA elements that hop from place to place in the genome, leaving
copies of themselves behind. For unknown reasons, there is a lot more
jumping going on in the mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The structure of the mouse genome is also evolving twice as fast
as the human genome. But the rates of change are very different from
one site in the genome to the next, a surprising finding that may
overturn the previous conception of a uniform pace of mutation.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest fear we had was we'd look at the mouse and human
genomes and we'd say, 'Well, that's kind of what we thought,' " said
Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, a major funder of the mouse genome effort. "We need not
have feared."</TE>
