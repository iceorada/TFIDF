<KH>POP MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>He plays well with others</HD>
<DH>The versatile Jon Brion, often a one-man band, performs
with others at Spaceland to produce some remarkable music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The one-man band is a noble figure. He can be found on your local
boardwalk, a bass drum on his back, cymbals on his knees, a guitar in
his hands, drumsticks tied to his elbows. Jon Brion is sort of like
that, though he doesn't play the bass with his feet.</LD>
<LD>   All by himself, he can craft a complete vision of rock and pop as
a venue to explore and escape his obsessions. As a songwriter,
singer, soloist, producer and sideman, he regularly demonstrates a
frantic versatility that has him from one moment to the next sounding
like the next Randy Newman, or Brian May.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Brion began a month of weekly gigs at Spaceland
experimenting with a full band. This week the players were barely
rehearsed, and yet they glided easily along Brion's wave of sudden
inspirations, playing new songs and some taken from Brion's 1999 solo
album, "Meaningless."</LD>
<TE>   Brion maintains his longtime weekly gig at Largo on Fridays, but
said he came to Spaceland from "the need to play some rock guitar."
He opened with a Largo-ish solo set, piecing together songs by
himself -- first a drum pattern, then a keyboard riff, before adding
voice and guitar. Guitarist Josh Klinghoffer had only met Brion that
afternoon, and yet in a second set with the full band, both dueled on
guitar as if they'd been touring together for years.</TE>
<TE>   Lyrics were often words of longing and bitter romance set to
elegant, if spare melodies on toy piano, or a raw, lovelorn ballad
that sounded like an outtake from Sun Records, as Brion sang, "I
don't need you for another excuse to cry."</TE>
<TE>   Or for a reason to make some remarkable pop music.</TE>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Some Spanish riches for harpsichord</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Eclectic Orange Festival winds down, its Latin kick remains.
Thursday night, harpsichordist Andreas Staier added to that kick with
a program of Baroque music from Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Domenico Scarlatti's quirky and irresistible sonatas
dominated, but there were also sonatas by Sebastian de Albero, Josep
Galles and Jose Ferrer, as well as a set of variations by Felix
Maximo Lopez. It was a fertile period in Iberian musical history, and
we are still the richer for it.</LD>
<LD>   Staier, a German musician -- not, as erroneous information coming
from the Eclectic Orange sponsors had earlier stated, Dutch -- is a
solid and articulate performer, seldom a fiery one. Yet he delivered
the contents of this intriguing program with great clarity and jumped
the technical hurdles effortlessly. That is saying a lot, given the
abundance of ideas, moods and quick notes here.</LD>
<TE>   Because of his unflagging and consistent inventiveness -- Domenico
Scarlatti is in the small company of Beethoven, Stravinsky and very
few others in being always unpredictable -- the six sonatas here
challenged the listener the most in their unexpected, often whimsical
mood changes.</TE>
<TE>   Happy surprises also abounded in the rest of the program. Staier
created a viable Albero suite in putting together a recercata, a
fugue and a sonata in D -- they complemented each other handsomely,
and his playing brought out their nuances.</TE>
<TE>   A set of three colorful sonatas by Galles also worked, through
their contrasts and similarities.</TE>
<TE>   The program began and ended with fandangos, first the set of
"Variaciones del Fandango Espanol" by Lopez, then the famous Fandango
in D minor by Soler. That last brought the audience of connoisseurs
in Neighborhood Congregational Church in Laguna Beach to its feet.</TE>

<HD>The tug of a primal push and pull</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Fisher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dance troupe called Grupo Krapp is from Argentina and they
probably don't know how dispiriting their name sounds to
English-speakers. Never mind. If they want to hint at their brand of
playful absurdity, replete with thoughtful commentary on life's
primal desires, then their homage to Samuel Beckett's play, "Krapp's
Last Tape," is as good a gesture as any.</LD>
<LD>   Something about the eager loopiness of Grupo Krapp's six
performers recalls the best moments of underground theater of the
1960s and early '70s. In an impressive debut at Highways in Santa
Monica Thursday night, the Buenos Aires-based group updated that
enthusiasm as part of a project called Performing Americas, meant to
impress with the latest from Latin America. Mission accomplished.</LD>
<TE>   In two style-proclaiming works, Grupo Krapp combined the
aggressively athletic postmodernism of, say, Elizabeth Streb or
Edouard Lock with a kind of Monty Python capering, and intermittent,
cinematic pauses that emphasized comedy and cruelty on display.
Themes are similar throughout, with the 40-minute "No Me Basabas?"
(Weren't You Kissing Me?) by Luciana Acuna, Luis Biasotto and
Gabriela Caretti quickly establishing the way little moments of
desire can kindle conflict. Two dancers seeming to lean in for a
kiss, for instance, spit in each others' faces instead. Time after
time, a playful overture turns into unwanted groping, and bodies that
could move in concert end up being tripped, slapped and stomped on in
intricate choreographic patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Recorded music interrupts silence; sometimes guitarist Gabriel
Almendros and accordionist Fernando Tur play. All of it is as
integrated into the action as the dancers and actor Edgardo Castro.</TE>
<TE>   In "Rio Seco" (by Acuna, Biasotto and fellow dancer Agustina
Sario), the workday slacks that were stripped off to reveal kneepads
in the previous piece become beachwear, but the menace and hilarity
remained the same. Dutiful lining up produced bickering, and hugging
and congratulating turned into slapping and harassing. Sex as a too
solitary or too aggressive activity surfaced; togetherness turned to
percussive slams, thuds, smacks and chops. After a while, you think
about sexual impulses and violence, how both are performed and
choreographed in life, how both constantly recur.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliant little scenes Grupo Krapp creates don't make sense,
and yet they do. There is slapstick, combat, then little moments of
gawky grace, culminating in a bathetic, slow-motion denouement to
George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." Someone curls up
under a piano, two men use a woman as a doormat, and lyrics flow over
the scene. "With every mistake, we must surely be learning," indeed.</TE>

<HD>In the U.S., this is never-get-to-see TV</HD>
<DH>Bold and frank children's programs from overseas, on view
at the Museum of TV &amp; Radio, are far removed from American fare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Hanania</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The camera opens on a child in blond pigtails and a red dress trying
to jump a ditch -- and splashing down, instead, into the mud. Soon
after, Guido, 11, reveals himself as a boy who has always felt he was
a girl, the camera following him as he shops for a dress and goes to
a friend's party. The documentary also looks on as he puts on a pair
of tights and a blouse, his prepubescent body seemingly transforming
into that of a girl.</LD>
<LD>   Strong stuff, this documentary called "The Day I Became
Nina." It's the kind of setup piece that might precede a heated
discussion on "Nightline."</LD>
<LD>   But instead, it aired on the Dutch network VPRO, as part of its
children's programming.</LD>
<TE>   This show and other children's programs from 21 countries will be
spotlighted on weekends through Nov. 24 at the Museum of Television &amp;
Radio in Beverly Hills, giving Americans a glimpse of how those
abroad program for their children. This weekend's screenings include
children's shows from China, the Netherlands ("The Day I Became
Nina"), Sweden, Mongolia, the United Kingdom and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly in Northern Europe, programming is often bolder and
franker without being preachy," says David Bushman, the exhibition's
curator. "Nina," for example, "was made without tiptoeing around the
issue. It assumes that kids are ready to know this." Such a show, he
says, could not be made here.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Buckland, chief executive of the Australian Children's
Television Foundation, concurs. She contends that although a show
like "Sesame Street" is unsurpassed in teaching young children basic
skills, that advantage rapidly disappears as the target audience gets
older and the shows become "overly commercial."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, she says, the 12-year-old Australian program "Round
the Twist" may look at topics such as the effect of broken families
on children, then lighten its offerings with the likes of a urinating
contest, in which 9-year-old Little Squirt proudly outdistances his
12-year-old rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The show spotlighting Little Squirt's achievement won the
prestigious Prix Jeunesse competition in Germany eight years ago,
then aired in 70 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it was years before the Little Squirt program was
finally shown in America -- on Fox -- and then only after being
substantially edited.</TE>
<TE>   This and other examples make Buckland question if we Americans
aren't a bit prudish?</TE>
<TE>   "Americans don't realize that humor is a great way to engage
children," she says, maintaining that American TV executives focus
more on shows that are broadly commercial and generate few waves.
What is lost, she says, is authenticity. "Our experience is that
although our kids like some animation, they prefer stories about real
children living real lives."</TE>
<TE>   David Kleeman, executive director of the American Center for
Children and Media, a Chicago think tank, agrees that programmers
abroad often take chances their American counterparts don't. He cites
as evidence the short "The Breakfast," which aired on Irish public
television. In it, a boy at a Catholic boarding school brings
breakfast every day to the priest who is his school supervisor.
"Every morning, he licks the sausages just enough to get a taste, then
goes back and eats his gruel," recounts Kleeman.  One day, the boy
delivers the breakfast, only to find the priest dead.  His reaction?  He
happily eats the sausage-and-egg breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Although the film's humor is universal, Kleeman says, its cultural
specificity to Irish society has kept it from airing on American
airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and, increasingly, Japan "tend to export global
programs stripped of all culture," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That may be changing, however; a small effort is growing to
broaden what children in the U.S. see. Kleeman points to an episode
of "A Walk in Your Shoes" on the Nickelodeon affiliate Noggin. Airing
six weeks after Sept. 11, the show featured a Christian girl putting
on a Muslim veil, then visiting a mall alongside her Muslim American
counterpart -- and discovering firsthand the powerful stigma of being
identified with that group.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such efforts, however, the bulk of idiosyncratic
children's programming still comes from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   One such offering is "Ponds of Mirror." In this Iranian telefilm,
a strangely dressed boy in a strange land desperately looks for water
to save an orphaned goldfish, finally finding the goldfish a home in
a pool by a mosque. Even if a region's traditions are different, says
Jenna Alden, assistant curator for the exhibition, "it's the sort of
quest to which any child anywhere can relate."</TE>

<HD>The return of Coleman, minus the body-piercing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman returned to the San Francisco Jazz
Festival Thursday night for the first time since his controversial
appearance in 1994. That now-legendary performance was a multimedia
presentation featuring music, video, contortionists and multiple body
piercing. In dramatic contrast, Coleman's Thursday night concert at
Davies Symphony Hall was a spare, to-the-point offering of his music,
performed with the sole accompaniment of drummer Denardo Coleman (his
son) and bassist Charnett Moffett (the son of an earlier
collaborator, drummer Charles Moffett).</LD>
<LD>   Making only his second appearance with the trio this year, the
72-year-old Coleman offered a program of all newly composed material.
Typically, however, it was often difficult to determine where one
selection ended and another began, to ascertain where written
passages transited into improvisations.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman burst onto the jazz scene in 1959, playing an innovative
style incorporating improvisation unrestricted by harmonic cadences
or metric bar lines. Embraced by a number of influential jazz
figures, his music also affected a generation of new young players,
many of whom adapted, to varying degrees, aspects of his freely
improvised techniques.</LD>
<TE>   Relying upon a relatively small collection of melodic fragments,
he built his solos by continually shaping and reshaping them across
the length and breadth of his horn.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the fragments he employed in the approximately 10 new
pieces were tinged with the blues of his Texas roots; others were
employed as splashes of color to contrast with his frequent use of
relatively simple, scale-based runs. And virtually everything he
played was heavily dependent upon sequential passages -- that is,
playing a phrase, then repeating it at a higher or lower level (one
of the most essential aspects of composition and improvisation).</TE>
<TE>   The high points in his playing and writing almost all took place
during more pensive numbers. In part, their appeal -- ironically,
given Coleman's free style -- traced to the specific harmonic
implications in his engaging, but clearly sequence-based melodies.
One piece (all were untitled and unannounced) recalled the blues
shuffle style that occasionally surfaced in his early work; on
others, Coleman picked up a trumpet or a violin, cranking out bursts
of sheer musical noise, often in combination with sounds generated by
Moffett's electronically enhanced bass.</TE>

<HD>'Master Spy' is not a masterful account</HD>
<DH>FBI turncoat Robert Hanssen's double life becomes a 4-hour
slog.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John le Carre was probably on the mark when he called spies "a
squalid procession of vain fools, traitors ... sadists and drunkards,
people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives."</LD>
<LD>   Much of real-life espionage is surely James Bond-less, offering
less excitement and glamour than tedium and drudgery. That Le Carre
regularly has fashioned such grayness into fascinating intrigue, from
"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" to "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,
Spy," attests to his skill as a novelist.</LD>
<LD>   Quite the opposite is "Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story," a
collaboration by Norman Mailer and Lawrence Schiller that delivers
drabness without any redeeming fascination. Mailer and Schiller have
worked as a team previously. The genesis of their turgid CBS
two-parter is nearly as convoluted as the mind of its real-life
antihero. First came the "Master Spy" teleplay that Schiller had
Mailer write, then "Into the Mirror: The Life of Master Spy Robert P.
Hanssen," Schiller's book based on Mailer's script and research.</LD>
<TE>   Lastly comes the Schiller-directed production itself, a
surrealistic one that fails to translate the life of convicted spy
Hanssen into anything approaching a narrative meriting four hours of
TV. Schiller's book about this patriot-turned-poseur is more readable
than its companion drama is watchable. How curious that a species as
twisted and venal as Hanssen -- who used his high position in the
FBI's counterintelligence unit to sell out his country before his
arrest in 2001 -- can be this dull on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Played here by William Hurt, Hanssen is now serving a life
sentence without parole after spending most of his 25 years with the
FBI spying first for the Soviet Union and then the Russians. Using
the code name Ramon, he collected a small fortune from Moscow for
using his access to make a devastating breach in U.S. security.</TE>
<TE>   The book's title is significant, for mind readers Schiller and
Mailer attempt to speak for Hanssen by having him repeatedly aim
Shakespearean soliloquies at a mirror. "If the KGB doesn't come
apart, maybe you won't either," he tells his reflection. And later,
when the FBI begins unraveling Ramon, he informs the mirror, "It's
over." As well as stultifying, especially as we hear only the
imaginations of Mailer and Schiller, for Hanssen was not interviewed
by them.</TE>
<TE>   The Hanssen introduced here seems an unlikely secret agent. On the
surface, he's the classic square, an impassive geek whose leaden face
is creased only rarely by a noncommittal smile. He expresses himself
obliquely and is so awkward physically that Hurt has him rocking from
side to side as he walks. He and his wife, Bonnie (Mary-Louise
Parker), have six children. They are devout conservative Catholics
and regular churchgoers. In addition, Hanssen is known to be
passionately anti-Communist. But early in his FBI career he needs
money to make ends meet, and the rest becomes history.</TE>
<TE>   "Master Spy" has Hanssen being abused by his nasty father (Peter
Boyle) and treachery being in his blood. He betrays not only his
country but also Bonnie, by offering her to his smarmy best friend,
Jack Hoschouer (David Strathairn), like fresh meat. He allows him to
secretly ogle her in the shower and peep at his wife and him having
sex, ultimately inviting Hoschouer to have at her himself.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hanssen is turned on sexually by a beautiful stripper
(Hilit Pace), and, although he can't quite bring himself to go all
the way, he buys her expensive gifts during a weird romance that
threads through much of Part 2.</TE>
<TE>   It reads more titillatingly than it plays. Even as Hanssen's
sexual senses explode, his eyes remain dead. As does much of his
story.</TE>

<LD>AS Howard Cosell used to say, Jon Burlingame told it like it was
("Spy Films Lose Heart," Nov. 5). Today's Hollywood seems to be under
the impression that cynicism equals cool. The characters of the
classic spy series of the '60s, like "I Spy" and "Wild Wild West,"
were everything that their film counterparts are not: They were
caring, charismatic, held high moral values, did not denigrate each
other and were tender, yet tough as nails.</LD>
<LD>   This is one reason why these series will always be treasured in
many people's hearts, whereas the remakes will find a quick detour
into our mental and emotional trash bin.</LD>

<TE>   KENNETH Turan enumerates many reasons why the producers of the
big-screen version of "I Spy" missed the mark (" 'I Spy': Mission
Implausible," Nov. 1). Perhaps their biggest mistake, not mentioned,
was the failure to understand that without Earle Hagen's Emmy
Award-winning music, their version of "I Spy" is merely another Eddie
Murphy vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Hagen's music was integral to the the show, just as it enhanced
all of his collaborations with producer Sheldon Leonard. Imagine "The
Andy Griffith Show" without Earle's theme.</TE>

<LD>ROBERT Hilburn treads too lightly in his treatment of the Rolling
Stones' Oct. 31 appearance at Staples Center ("It's the Spirit That
Counts," Nov. 2). It was not my first Stones concert, and it ranks
low on the scale. The show was listless, with awkward pauses between
songs. Too often, lengthy codas that seemed to be building to
something just ended. Lighting and visuals were arbitrary.</LD>
<LD>   Equally disappointing was the conduct of much of the crowd -- also
experienced at the recent show by (not quite as) old-timers Rush.</LD>
<LD>   Too many middle-aged men in attendance take these nights out as
opportunities to relive their youth. Guys -- you can't handle beer
the way you used to. That's why you tip over.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOWEVER rapturous Hilburn was about the Stones show, it would be
nice to hear from one of your reviewers had they been sitting in the
upper levels of Staples Center. For our $200 tickets (each bought
five months in advance, including the bogus Clear Channel club
membership), we got seats three rows from the ceiling. The sound was
muddled at best; not a single greeting or statement that Mick made
could be understood.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mullany</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EVEN though it was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek piece, in part, I
was dismayed by Roy Rivenburg's barely amusing article on the Rolling
Stones rocking into old age ("Turning Their (Hearing Aid) Knobs Up to
11," Nov. 2). Has any writer at The Times ever dared to poke fun of
Robert Altman for making movies well into his 70s? Or perhaps a noted
classical, jazz or blues musician for refusing to retire at 65? I
think not.</TE>
<TE>   The Rolling Stones are playing music that is normally associated
with fans between ages 10 and 25. All those middle-aged folks paying
outrageous prices to line the pockets of the already super-wealthy
Stones are simply reliving their youth. It's not terribly different
from thirtysomething fans packing Staples Center to see U2, the band
that supplied the soundtrack to their teen years.</TE>

<LD>REGARDING Dana Gioia's remark that L.A. has not produced a great poet
("NEA Nominee Puts Poetry Back on Page 1," by Tim Rutten, Nov. 2), I
would suggest that notion belongs to another time.</LD>
<LD>   Whitman wrote well over a century ago, before the phenomenon of
Ellis Island. If Ferlinghetti speaks for San Francisco, it is the
city of 50 years back and not the Bay Area megalopolis extending to
San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. was born in the last half of the 20th century, and even that
place is unrecognizable from our cosmopolitan sprawl of today. No
single voice can embody the Hispanic, Asian, Russian, Israeli and
Iranian experience along with the Hollywood dream machine, suburban
and Westside consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. starts in Santa Barbara and ends at the Mexican border. To
articulate this expanse is to write with the breadth and breath of
all humanity. That other so-called L.A. is a cartographer's fiction.</TE>

<LD>THANK you for Geoff Boucher's insightful piece on Kurt Cobain's
journals ("Notes From a Reluctant Rock Star," Nov. 5). I would
suggest that even if he recorded such entries as "Look through my
things and figure me out," or "If You Read You'll Judge," he was
writing more for himself than for others, and he was writing to try
to save his life.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing some of his words to others was allowing himself to
open his life onto paper, so he could take a better look -- his way
of facing himself, of coming to terms. In writing workshops I
conduct, at some point I ask: Am I creating the journal, or is the
journal creating me?</LD>

"stationary" Cobain wrote on. Or was he immobile at the time?</TE>

<LD>JUST when I thought we had really come a long way, baby, Robert W.
Welkos' article on Power Up's sexual harassment suit ("Sexual
Harassment Suit Roils Lesbian Industry Group," Nov. 2) proves
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   For those of us who began working in the entertainment industry in
the 1950s and 1960s, hiding in the closet was de rigueur. With the
advent of the women's movement and organizations such as NOW and
Women in Film, we gradually began to feel a sense of dignity and
pride -- about our gender as well as our sexual orientation. In more
recent times, groups like GLAAD (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation), LIFT (Lesbians in Film and TV) and Power Up further
helped to solidify our positive self-image, self-worth and feelings
of empowerment.</LD>
<LD>   How sad and disappointing to now read that the co-founders of
Power Up are behaving (publicly, yet) like a pair of adolescents. I
don't really care about who is harassing who. I do care deeply about
the fallout that this nonsense (in all of its gory details) will
engender, making all lesbians look like fools.</LD>

<HD>Fans riot at canceled Guns N' Roses show</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>VANCOUVER, Canada -- Hundreds of Guns N' Roses fans took part in a
riot that erupted here Thursday night when the first date of the rock
band's first concert tour in nine years was canceled shortly before
show time.</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver police had arrested a dozen people as of Friday morning,
with more arrests possible as the investigation continues. At least
three people were charged with inciting the riot that lasted an hour,
during which angry fans hurled chunks of concrete at security staff
and police, and tossed metal barricades through windows at the
General Motors Place arena.</LD>
<LD>   Police used pepper spray, riot sticks and dogs to disperse the
crowd, police spokeswoman Sarah Bloor said Friday. There were minor
injuries and more than $100,000 in damage to the arena, she added.</LD>
<TE>   The show was canceled when leader Axl Rose did not arrive in
Vancouver. No official explanation was given as of press time Friday.
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based group's label, Interscope
Records, said a statement was being prepared by the band's
management.</TE>
<TE>   A Boston-based spokeswoman for Clear Channel Entertainment, which
books concerts at GM Place, said she had been told that Axl Rose's
flight from Los Angeles was delayed by the storm that hit the area
Thursday, and that there may have been a mechanical problem with the
plane. The other band members were in Vancouver awaiting his arrival.</TE>
<TE>   She said the group's crew was setting up its gear in Tacoma,
Wash., in anticipation that GNR's concert scheduled for Friday night
would take place.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that Rose hadn't planned an earlier arrival in
Vancouver didn't sit well with some concert industry veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the tour opener -- why wasn't he there a day early?"
asked Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a concert-industry
tracking publication. "It's almost unconscionable for him to try to
come into the country so shortly before show time.... And the bad
weather coming to California had been forecast for days. This was not
a surprise storm."</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 fans were lined up waiting for the doors to open at
7:30 p.m. when an announcement was made that the concert would be
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "Within two minutes, that's when the behavior erupted," police
spokeswoman Bloor said. The majority left the scene, she said, but
2,000 to 3,000 remained to watch the rioters, hundreds soon joining
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver show was the first of more than two dozen on the
group's "Chinese Democracy" North American tour, which is scheduled
for concerts Jan. 3 and 4 at the Forum in Inglewood. It was intended
to put the band back on track after numerous false starts and delays
in completing the "Chinese Democracy" album, which still has not been
released.</TE>
<TE>   Riots are not unheard of in the stormy history of Guns N' Roses.</TE>
<TE>   Rose sparked one at a 1991 St. Louis performance when he jumped
into the crowd to confront a fan who was photographing him. Rose was
convicted of assault and property damage. In 1992, the volatile
singer caused another incident during a concert in Montreal when he
left the stage 50 minutes into the show and told fans they should
demand their money back.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn reported from Vancouver; Randy Lewis from Los
Angeles.</TE>

<LD>If a society is judged in part by how well it pays homage to its
elders, then the television industry has consistently been sorely
lacking -- a point underscored again this week when the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences inducted six members into its hall of
fame.</LD>
<LD>   Many venerable titans of the medium -- including Carol Burnett,
Sid Caesar, Bob Newhart, Angela Lansbury, Grant Tinker, and producers
Norman Lear and David L. Wolper -- attended Wednesday's induction
ceremony in Beverly Hills. It was held in honor of "The Carol Burnett
Show's" Harvey Korman and Tim Conway, "All in the Family's" Jean
Stapleton and producer Bud Yorkin, the late director John
Frankenheimer, and costume designer Bob Mackie.</LD>
<LD>   The current crop of industry leaders, however, was virtually
nowhere to be found. Not a single programming chief from the
broadcast networks was there. Even Hollywood's trade papers, Daily
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, failed to cover the event.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, these executives are harried. It's not only a sweeps
month, but also networks are busily ordering series concepts for next
season. And there's a black-tie gala, premiere or charity affair,
somewhere, just about any night of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the events for which people turn out do say something about
priorities, and in this case, their absence only serves to lend
credence to ageism charges that have become common among the
generation born before the Eisenhower administration.</TE>
<TE>   All those who skipped Wednesday's ceremony, by the way, missed
some eloquent and memorable moments, among them Korman's riotously
funny acceptance speech, in which he publicly expressed his love for
Alec Baldwin (a presenter earlier in the evening) and questioned the
award-show convention of thanking your family.</TE>
<TE>   "My family's sitting in front of me, and I love them dearly, but I
don't know what the hell you did to help me," Korman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lear, who spoke on behalf of Stapleton, observed after watching
clips of the inductees that through their body of work, "every one of
them have added years to my life. I believe that with all my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the people being honored have made significant
contributions to television. Despite their renown and the surplus of
available channels, however, the 15th annual hall of fame ceremony
will not be televised, the deal having fizzled because the telecast
drew weak ratings in years past.</TE>
<TE>   Although indicting the TV business for this might seem like making
a mountain out of a molehill, consider the context. A class-action
lawsuit about age discrimination against writers -- listing networks,
studios and talent agencies as defendants -- is wending its way
through the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few weeks ago, meanwhile, Gary H. Miller, a 54-year-old
writer-producer who has worked on such series as "Boy Meets World"
and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," filed his own suit against 20th
Century Fox and the WB network for cutting him loose when they shook
up the writing staff on "Reba." They cited a desire, he alleges, to
retain some of the sitcom's "greener writers."</TE>
<TE>   The studio has called the suit "absolutely baseless." The merits
of the case notwithstanding, what's most notable is that Miller would
be willing to file it at all, given the impact that action will
likely have on career prospects.</TE>
<TE>   The message is that at 54, with agents advising him to delete
earlier credits from his resume to mask his age, Miller isn't sure he
has a career anymore to sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, it's a frightening thing to do.... It's scary to take
on those entities," he said, alluding to industry giants Fox and AOL
Time Warner. Still, he added, "I've gotten calls from people I
haven't heard from in a while saying, 'Go get 'em.' "</TE>
<TE>   To some, the treatment of TV's emeritus members reflects a
short-term mentality, one that leaves little time for tributes to
those who came before. From that perspective, few of the famous names
at the academy's hall of fame ceremony have delivered a hot pilot
recently, leaving them deficient in the "What have you done for me
lately?" department.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no respect for tradition," veteran manager Bernie
Brillstein said in an interview; he'd also touched on that point in a
commentary published earlier this week in Daily Variety. "There is no
respect for the people who got them there."</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment industry has always consisted of three types of
people: those who want to do it, those who currently do it and those
who used to do it. Inevitably, the first and third categories will
always far outnumber the second.</TE>
<TE>   That second group, however, has perhaps forgotten that these
careers can be fleeting. And although it's understandable that
today's heavyweights would be preoccupied with concerns that might
prolong or shorten their tenures, it's worth reminding them that they
started out in the first category, and no matter how successful they
are, they're going to wind up in the third.</TE>

<LD>Madonna's latest movie, "Swept Away," is being swept aside in
Britain. The film, directed by her British husband, Guy Ritchie,
won't screen at theaters in Britain because it flopped so badly
across the Atlantic, its distributor said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Following the disappointing box office results in the U.S., Guy
Ritchie's 'Swept Away' will not be released theatrically in the
U.K.," Columbia Tristar said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The film, a remake of a 1974 Italian movie of the same name, had
been scheduled to open in British theaters in March but instead will
go straight to video, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   The movie bombed on its release in America on Oct. 11. It took in
just $375,000 at 196 theaters on its first weekend and to date has
brought in a paltry $598,645, according to the box-office tracking
firm Exhibitor Relations.</TE>

<LD>Showtime, which has garnered attention and some of its highest
ratings with the gay-themed serial "Queer as Folk," has ordered a
dramatic program dealing with the lesbian community in Los Angeles,
tentatively titled "Earthlings," to premiere next summer.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Beals ("Flashdance"), Pam Grier ("Jackie Brown") and
"24's" Mia Kirshner are part of the ensemble cast.</LD>
<LD>   Showtime's parent company, Viacom, has been exploring the
possibility of launching a gay cable network. Reruns of "Queer as
Folk" (which will begin its third season next year) and the new

<LD>There was nothing covert or subtle about the CIA's review of an
author who accused the agency of trying to censor his book on FBI spy
Robert Philip Hanssen.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you do when your new book lands on the market with a
resounding thud?" began a statement from CIA spokesman Bill Harlow,
posted Friday on the agency's Web site, www.cia.gov.</LD>
<LD>   The book in question is "Spy: The Inside Story of How the FBI's
Robert Hanssen Betrayed America," by David Wise.</LD>
<TE>   The CIA's statement said it has "far better things to do than to
worry about yet another book on Mr. Hanssen" and speculated that the
author would use the agency's response to publicize "his otherwise
unremarkable book."</TE>
<TE>   What irked the CIA about the book, which was published last month,
was an opinion piece by Wise in Thursday's edition of the New York
Times titled "Spies as Censors." Wise said he came under "intense
pressure" from the agency to suppress the name of a CIA officer
wrongly suspected of spying for Russia in the case that later led to
the capture of FBI mole Hanssen, who had been selling U.S. secrets to
Moscow.</TE>

<HD>Delaney is leaving 'CSI: Miami'</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Kim Delaney is out of the new hit crime series "CSI: Miami"
after just 10 episodes, CBS says. The network described the decision
as a joint one involving the network and producers "upon recognizing
that the character of Megan Donner was becoming less integral to the
series."</LD>
<LD>   Delaney, 40, who played a DNA specialist in the "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" spinoff, has filmed her last episode. It will air Nov.
25, and her character's departure will be explained, CBS said.</LD>
<LD>   No additional changes are planned for the show, which stars David
Caruso and is the top-ranked new fall series.</LD>
<TE>   Delaney, who won a best-supporting actress Emmy for her portrayal
of Det. Diane Russell on ABC's "NYPD Blue," was belatedly added to
the "CSI" cast as production began in July and after her ABC legal
drama "Philly" was not renewed for a second season.</TE>

<DH>A show called 'New Hotels for Global Nomads' reflects a
curator's belief that hostelries are design laboratories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>Donald Albrecht has been taking things from hotels -- and we're not
talking about towels.</LD>
<LD>   He has a quirky yellow chair from Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial
Hotel in Tokyo (opened in 1922). He has a heart-shaped tub from a
Poconos resort. He has a cutaway map of New York's Waldorf-Astoria
from 1937 and a model from the implausibly lavish Burj al-Arab, a
sultan's dream come true on the coast of Dubai.</LD>
<LD>   In all, Albrecht has filled 5,800 square feet of the Smithsonian
Institution's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum with artifacts,
photographs, films, speculations and fantasies about hotels. The
reason, the curator says, is that hotels make us think, and make us
feel, in a way few other structures do.</LD>
<TE>   His exhibition is called "New Hotels for Global Nomads." And as it
happens, the show, through March 2, has arrived at a moment when one
of the world's great hotel cities (66,000 rooms and counting) seems
to be full of people thinking big thoughts about hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Some 50 blocks south of the Cooper-Hewitt's space, in Times
Square, the 45-story tower of a new Westin Hotel, clad in as many
hues as Joseph's Technicolor Dreamcoat and bisected by a bending line
of sky-bound white light, is stopping New Yorkers and tourists alike
in their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by the Miami firm Arquitectonica to mirror the frenetic
energy of the urban blocks below, the hotel has been gradually
opening over the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful," said a purveyor of $10 watches as he stood on
the sidewalk across the street one day last week. A French tourist
agreed. But others aren't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this the ugliest building in New York?" asked the New Yorker
in a recent headline. Writing below it, critic Paul Goldberger
employed such adjectives as "shrill," "banal," "tawdry" and "gaudy"
on the way to suggesting that the Westin "makes Times Square vulgar
in a whole new way, extending up into the sky."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a few blocks farther downtown, about 45,000 of the
world's top hoteliers and restaurateurs are meeting this weekend at
the Javits Convention Center in their annual convention.</TE>
<TE>   This year, it's a mournful occasion, with average room rates and
occupancy levels down all over. But this slump follows a decade of
remarkable growth: Between 1993 and 2001, the U.S. hotel industry
grew from 3.3 million rooms to 4.2 million, with $103.6 billion in
annual sales. Only the car and food industries are bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first large-scale hotels showed up in the Eastern United
States about 200 years ago and then spread around the world, their
shape and contents have both mirrored social changes and fueled
romantic daydreams: when London's Savoy Hotel added electricity in
1889, for instance; or when the Gideons started placing Bibles at the
Superior Hotel in Superior, Mont., in 1908; when the Flamingo
introduced the casino-hotel concept to Las Vegas in 1946; when the
Hilton chain decided to put televisions in all of its guest rooms in
1951.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to do exhibitions that engage people's everyday lives,"
said Albrecht, standing near the Cooper-Hewitt's entrance on East
91st Street as museum members filed in for the exhibition's Oct. 28
opening reception. He began to nurse the idea of a hotel show several
years ago, he said, when the proliferation of eclectically designed
boutique lodgings worldwide convinced him that "the hotel was back as
a design laboratory."</TE>
<TE>   Soon he was gathering string to support his idea of hotels as
symbols of globalism, places of business, places of refuge, as
addresses where, as British novelist Frederick Marryat once said,
"you meet everybody and everybody meets you."Albrecht, who spent 12
years as an architect and six years organizing exhibitions on film
design at New York's Museum of the Moving Image, calls himself a
believer in "architecture as a narrative act."</TE>
<TE>   His previous projects include "On the Job," a deconstruction of
the American workplace for the National Building Museum in Washington
in late 2000, and a survey of design work by Charles and Ray Eames
that traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   His work on the hotel show began in January 2001. Collecting
photographs, models, film clips and artifacts, and then commissioning
artists, he pulled together about three dozen projects.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of them represent real hotels, a third represent
speculative hotels proposed by architects and another third are
interpretations by artists and photographers, some literal (like the
documentary photographs of Las Vegas), some off the wall (like the
illustrated account from artist Sophie Calle, who 19 years ago took a
job as a hotel maid in Venice and covertly photographed and took
notes in the dirty rooms to which she was assigned. The hotel was
unnamed; museum officials note that the artist was fired after two
weeks.)</TE>
<TE>   On one monitor, an odd little Spike Jonze-directed video of
Christopher Walken runs in an endless loop. Walken, looking like a
latter-day Willy Loman, enters a deserted and sepulchral business
hotel (the downtown Los Angeles Marriott, in fact) with his suitcase,
then is seized by the rhythm of a Fatboy Slim tune and, in an eerie
echo of Gene Kelly dances across the lobby, up the escalator and even
through the atrium air.</TE>
<TE>   The freewheeling exhibition also offers glimpses of urban hotels,
hotels "on the move" (artist Vito Acconci proposes a car whose body
unfolds upward, transforming it by night into a mini-skyscraper with
a four-level bunk bed), hotels as global business, natural hotels and
fantasy hotels.</TE>
<TE>   One exhibit shows the Hotel, in Lucerne, Switzerland, where
architect Jean Nouvel has placed oversized movie stills of sensual
moments (from Federico Fellini to David Lynch) on the ceilings of all
25 rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these displays are earnest efforts at making a better
mousetrap, such as the photos of the Loews hotel chain's 2000
adaptation of the 1932 Philadelphia Saving Fund Society building.
(Loews Hotels is the exhibition's principal sponsor.)</TE>
<TE>   Other displays, like Diller &amp; Scofidio's "Hotel InterClone," are
more notional. Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio are MacArthur
grant-winning architects, but their contribution here (first
conceived as an entry in the 1997 Istanbul Biennial) is a
never-to-be-realized pitch for an "InterClone" hotel chain, serving
cities from Tijuana to Ljubljana, Slovenia, with guest rooms of
matching dimensions and amenities (one television, two chairs, desk,
dresser, two queen beds, two lamps), but fabrics and colors tailored
to each locale. Thus you see all the world's variety reduced to
superficial caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Japanese capsule hotel unit, the "habitation
module" from the people at NASA, the scaffolding-based "vertical
campsite" for temporary placement in an urban park -- something to
intrigue just about every traveler and something else to scare that
same traveler off.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a third-generation hotelier. I deeply believe in hotels,"
Loews Chairman and Chief Executive Jonathan Tisch told the assembled
crowd after walking through the exhibition on opening night.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, "I'm going to let my kids figure out how to get
into some of those bedrooms upstairs."</TE>

<LD>Winona Ryder's trial is surely the least important ever to be given
the media's version of a full-court press. Let's face it: At the end
of the day, this was a trial for shoplifting.</LD>
<LD>   There were no bodies, no sex, no illicit drugs, no racial issues
nor any of the other allegedly significant attributes editors and
producers usually cite to justify the sort of round-the-clock,
floor-to-ceiling coverage Ryder's trial and conviction received. This
was, in fact, a trial about hair bows and mutilated blouses -- albeit
absurdly pricey ones. No responsible journalist whose employer
derives substantial revenues from department store advertising ever
would minimize Saks' $5,560 loss. But an ambitious East Valley
tagging crew does about that much dollar damage on a good Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   As juror Walter Fox told The Times' Anna Gorman, "I do believe
that this was much ado about nothing."</LD>
<TE>   So, what was all this about?</TE>
<TE>   The conventional answer is that the news media simply pander to
our society's well-documented obsession with celebrity. That's part
of the answer -- for part of the press. The other, equally important
part is that each of the milestones in American journalism's 127-year
history of preposterously extravagant trial coverage coincides with a
significant shift in news-gathering capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The wretched Ryder's trial is such a milestone because it marks
the expansion of the kind of coverage previously accorded so-called
"trials of the century" to the truly trivial. In this case, the
engine driving the process was the fragmentation of the recently
created 24-hour cable news cycle into a bitterly competitive
marketplace in which CNN, Fox, MSNBC, Court TV and a variety of
entertainment channels are fighting for viewers. The result is a
circus, and, in this instance, everybody else was pulled into the
tent.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Santa Clara University Law School professor Gerald
Uelman believes at least 33 cases over the last 127 years have been
called "trials of the century." Some, like the prosecutions of Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, John Thomas Scopes, the Scottsboro
Boys, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and Daniel Ellsberg, involved
issues worthy of the appellation.</TE>
<TE>   Most involved situations more like the one that enmeshed Ryder,
including the first such event:</TE>
<TE>   In 1875, New York editor Theodore Tilton discovered that his wife
was engaged in an affair with his best friend, famed preacher and
abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher. Tilton sued Beecher for "alienation
of affection." The six-month trial that followed in Brooklyn City
Court gripped the imagination of the nation's leading city. As one
contemporary source described it: "The proceedings provided the chief
entertainment in town. Tickets were black-marketed at $5 apiece, and
as many as 3,000 persons a day were turned away, affording nearby
saloons a booming business. Prominent politicians, diplomats and
society leaders fought for seats in the courtroom with ordinary
curious folk and went without their lunch in order to hold them, or
bought sandwiches and soft drinks from vendors," who were allowed to
hawk their wares inside the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   But what transformed a local entertainment into a national
preoccupation were newspapers with new news-gathering techniques to
deploy. By the 1860s, Americans read more newspapers on a per capita
basis than any other people in the world. But there hadn't been a
gripping national story since Appomattox. Editors across the country
saw an opportunity in the Beecher trial and dispatched as many as 10
reporters -- the first recorded example of what we now call "pack
journalism" -- to cover it. Equally important, a new generation of
sketch artists was posted in the upper stories of nearby buildings
with spyglasses. The artists provided daily drawings of the jurors,
whose various postures were analyzed by commentators. The backgrounds
of individual jurors were exhaustively investigated by the press,
which subsequently hounded many of them out of town when they failed
to reach a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two years later, changes in the media created another such
New York trial that gripped the country. Harry Thaw, a Midwestern
millionaire and sexual sadist, shot society architect and playboy
Stanford White for the alleged seduction of his wife, sometime
actress Evelyn Nesbit. Thaw's 1907 trial -- which plays a part in
E.L. Doctorow's novel "Ragtime" -- coincided with a vicious new
circulation war between the Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers, as well
as the advent of the sensational style of reporting that came to be
called "yellow journalism."</TE>
<TE>   New advances in reproduction allowed the first widespread use of
photographs of the trial participants. The result was attention so
intense that Western Union had to open an office exclusively devoted
to transmitting daily reports from the courtroom. The reporting
contained in them was, by the standards of the day, so salacious that
the postmaster general considered banning the delivery of popular
newspapers through the mail.</TE>
<TE>   After two trials, Thaw was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
He suffered, according to his defense attorney, Delphin Delmas, from
"dementia Americana," a madness peculiar to American males whose
wives' purity has been violated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, Bruno Richard Hauptmann was tried for the kidnapping and
murder of Charles and Anne Lindbergh's 20-month-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Lindbergh's epic solo flight across the Atlantic had made him the
darling of a burgeoning new popular media that had recently
discovered the commercial possibilities of celebrity. His life seemed
to blend traditional American frontier heroism with technological
achievement. When Hauptmann's trial began, more than 700 print and
radio journalists and hundreds of radio and telephonic technicians
descended on the little town of Flemington, N.J., where the case was
tried.</TE>
<TE>   To serve the reporters, the local utility installed the largest
special-purpose telephone system in the world, one sufficient to
serve 1 million people. Radio correspondents were allowed to
broadcast live from the courtroom and, for the first time, newsreel
cameramen were allowed to film the court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   It was, according to H.L. Mencken, "the biggest story since the
Resurrection," and it resulted in a guilty verdict about which doubts
still linger.</TE>
<TE>   A clearer miscarriage of justice occurred in 1954, when the trial
of Dr. Sam Sheppard was dominated by the coverage of syndicated
columnists and radio commentators, who then were at the height of
their journalistic influence, commanding a following few editors were
willing to challenge.</TE>
<TE>   There is no need to recount the recent history of television's
intrusion into the courtroom, which began with the William Kennedy
Smith trial, passed through that of the Menendez Brothers and ended
in the electronic Armageddon that consumed Judge Lance Ito's
courtroom during the O.J. Simpson trial.</TE>
<TE>   As the Ryder trial demonstrates, technology and competition have
taken the media to the edge of another precipice from which the sane
and sober might wish to draw back.</TE>

<HD>Coming to you in glorious pixelvision</HD>
<DH>At the PXL This festival in Santa Monica, a discontinued
kids' camcorder is the center of attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no other film festival quite like Gerry Fialka's PXL This.
Any film submitted is guaranteed to be shown. There are no fees, no
awards. All Fialka asks of filmmakers is that they make at least part
of their film using a PXL 2000 videocam, the vintage Fisher-Price toy
he has loved for 12 years.</LD>
<LD>   Fialka is as amazed as anyone that he has so much company in his
devotion to the plastic toy. Since Fisher-Price stopped making the
camera in 1989, filmmakers started snatching them up as a tool to
make cheap little black-and-white films. A small national cult of
"pixelvisonaries" and "pixelators" arose -- artists, filmmakers,
students nerds and technogeeks -- all excited by the dancing grainy
images that bored Fisher-Price's original target market, kids 10 to
16.</LD>
<LD>   Work by the most accomplished artists has been discussed in
serious art texts and archived in museums.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, the 12th annual PXL This festival, at the Midnight
Special Bookstore in Santa Monica, will show its largest number of
entrants to date, 36. A distilled version of the program will be
shown in February at Santa Monica's Vidiots video store.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected 'PXL' to get to this," says Fialka, at home in
Venice where he lives in a cluttered two-room guest cottage. "We're
amazed every year people are still using this failed toy. You don't
see Etch-a-Sketch in hotsy-totsy art books or museums."</TE>
<TE>   Fialka, friendly and talkative, wears his hair in a long flowing
ponytail and has purple laces in his sneakers. He says he was raised
in Michigan on Super 8 home movies. After graduating from the
University of Michigan, where he studied film, he moved to L.A. to
make his way in the entertainment industry but became discouraged by
the commercialism around him. "Film as an art form has been swindled
by capitalism," he likes to say.</TE>
<TE>   Fialka worked briefly for Los Angeles' old and much beloved film
festival Filmex and then 10 years for musician Frank Zappa. One day,
Fialka says, a journalist came to interview Zappa and brought a PXL
2000. At the time, home video cameras sold for around $1,000, he
said. Fialka rushed to the nearest Toys R Us and bought a PXL 2000
for less than $100.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he says, he lives on his savings, makes films in pixelvision
and runs experimental film festivals from his home, which he shares
with his wife, singer Suzy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea of PXL This is to have a film festival where
there's no money involved," he says. "I would like to see more
emphasis on people creating art, not product."</TE>
<TE>   Some fairly mainstream filmmakers have inserted pixelvision into
their movies. Richard Linklater used pixelvision in "Slacker" (1991)
to show the point of view of a camera being used by a character.
Director Michael Almereyda's 1995 "Nadja" used pixelvision to show
how Dracula's daughter might view the world. Pixelvision has also
been used to document extreme sports and was the basis for a porn
festival in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The more recent digital video revolution has taken much of the
wind out of pixelvison's sails, says Canadian filmmaker Dwayne
Beaver, who's making a documentary on the camera.</TE>
<TE>   While pixelvision was the first to hand art back to artists
through cheaper materials, Beaver says the original pixelvisionaries,
like Almereyda, have moved on to other media. "Now when people shoot
pixelvision, it's because they love the aesthetics. They're doing it
more as paying homage," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Rummaging around the books and toy parts, scarves and paintings in
his house, Fialka finds tapes of this year's entrants. He climbs up
on a daybed under a window overgrown with vines and pops them into
the VCR one by one. His leans forward to better observe the images on
his 2-inch monitor.</TE>
<TE>   The films look like a cross between a security tape and a
transmission from outer space. But they also have a ghostly and
surreal quality that could capture your attention, make you laugh,
impart a sense of profound meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Or not.</TE>
<TE>   One documentary, Ellen Lake's "Rubber Band Ball," tells the story
of San Francisco shopkeepers who have created a 2,327-pound ball of
rubber bands in their market. "See the close-up? Look at that
texture," Fialka says. "To me, that's the essence of PXL This.</TE>
<TE>   Another describes a trip to the North Pole and the "sounds" of the
aurora borealis picked up with special equipment. In the narrative
"Down There," the screen splits into four; in one, a girl eats her
doll. In "Dip," a man leaps out of his bathtub backward.</TE>
<TE>   The festival usually draws 80 to 100 people, who pack the
bookstore. Usually a lot of them drift out before the festival is
finished.</TE>
<TE>   Fialka hopes that this year people will stay to the end. The final
piece is "Strange Weather," a 50-minute film once shown at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York about Florida crack addicts in Florida as
they ignore the pending disaster of Hurricane Andrew.</TE>
<TE>   Most films last between three and five minutes. "Every one of them
is equally as good, in my opinion," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There is some controversy in pixel land, Fialka says. A small band
of die-hard "purists" insists on shooting on the audio tape and
editing in the camera. Others have modified their cameras or rigged
them to record on digital video cameras, which they can edit on their
computers. Fialka comes down in the center.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to some concerns that pixelvision is an endangered medium
because the plastic toys eventually wear out, Fialka says the
adaptations will allow it to survive. And as long as he keeps finding
pixelvision films, he says, so will his festival.</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic speaks Mahler with French accent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mahler famously said that he put the world in his symphonies. And
that may be one reason that the Mahler revival was begun in America
by the most American of conductors, Leonard Bernstein. Like none
before him, he reveled in the enormous range of Mahlerian expression,
in epic scores in which the sweetest, sexiest waltz could turn a
sharp corner and suddenly face raw, death-haunted terror. This
American Mahler, a Mahler of all possibilities, became a world
standard.</LD>
<LD>   But it isn't the only Mahler, and Emmanuel Krivine offered up
something different and much rarer Thursday night for a Los Angeles
Philharmonic performance of the Fourth Symphony at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. Krivine's is French Mahler, and there have been
surprisingly few major French Mahler conductors. Pierre Boulez, who
is interested in Mahler as the musical revolutionary who paved the
way for 20th century music, is a notable exception.</LD>
<LD>   Krivine's Frenchness is mainly in the accent. The Fourth is the
shortest, the most genial and most classical of Mahler's symphonies.
But Mahler being Mahler, the score is, at 55 minutes, not exactly
short, nor is it all that classical or consistently genial. And,
Krivine being French, brevity, classical thought and geniality were
not missing, but a little translation was necessary.</LD>
<TE>   What was noticeably different was the sound. Krivine has the kind
of ornamental stick technique that you might imagine would drive the
orchestra crazy, but he did manage to get a pretty good imitation of
the French orchestral sound. A strong nasal oboe timbre pervaded the
woodwinds. The brass buzzed and snarled in that elegantly offbeat way
French brass can. The strings were fuller and warmer than may be
typically French. But in the second movement, where Mahler calls for
the concertmaster to use a violin tuned higher than the orchestra
violins, Martin Chalifour highlighted the macabre timbral effects to
an almost shocking degree.</TE>
<TE>   Krivine dwelt upon little. He rushed into and out of climaxes as
if to get over the dispensing of unpleasantries as quickly as
possible. But that breathless rushing also added the excitement. Even
in the last movement, a glorified song about heavenly pleasures,
Krivine seemed to be winking at Mahler's sentimentality. He warmly
accompanied the soloist, Heidi Grant Murphy, who sang with lusty
charm, but rambunctiously stormed through the orchestral interludes.</TE>
<TE>   In all, this performance did a good job of reminding us just how
strange Mahler's music is, no matter how familiar it has become.
Under Krivine's overactive baton, the Mahler Fourth reminded me of a
hyperactive French intellectual, a deep thinker, pleasure-loving yet
pessimistic -- say a Sartre espousing this and that idea while
jumping into and out of bed with all who would listen.</TE>
<TE>   For the first half of the program, Krivine chose another genial
work, Beethoven's First Symphony. Beethoven doesn't do accents quite
so well as Mahler, but the third movement had an engaging rhythmic
verve. The Finale was amusing, with Krivine replacing the blunt humor
of Beethoven's rushing scales with a more mordant wit, his baton
appearing to mimic the erratic flight of a sped-up hummingbird. I
don't know how the orchestra follows him, but it does. The playing
all evening was of a high, if odd, order.</TE>

<HD>Al Gore returns as a talking head</HD>
<DH>The former vice president provides the voice for his noggin
in a jar on the animated sci-fi sitcom 'Futurama' Sunday. Richard
Nixon's head co-stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore makes a return to "Futurama" this
weekend. Surprisingly, he does not play a robot.</LD>
<LD>   Gore guest stars as his own head in a jar as the sci-fi sitcom
blasts off for its fifth season Sunday at 7 p.m. on Fox. It's easy to
see how "Futurama" recently won an Emmy for best animated series:
This global-warming-themed episode, written by Aaron Ehasz and
directed by Peter Avanzino, shows off the show's formula of clever
humor and whimsical graphics.</LD>
<LD>   When warming threatens the Earth in the next century, Gore hosts
an emergency summit in Kyoto, Japan, where he is introduced as
"inventor of the environment and first emperor of the moon."
Unfortunately for the Planet Express crew, the solution to the crisis
may mean the end of Bender and his robotic brethren, whose tailpipe
emissions are found to be the cause.</LD>
<TE>   Gore, who appeared on the show in May 2000, may hope another round
of self-mocking will help his image. It didn't hurt Richard Nixon
when he went on "Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In" in 1968 to declare, "Sock
it to me!"</TE>
<TE>   But the political barbs here are equal-opportunity. In one attempt
to solve the crisis, Nixon's head (long story) urges the Planet
Express crew to fetch ice from Halley's comet, complaining, "I'm
sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle."

<HD>Tabloids pounce as the butler spills it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Depending on which British tabloid you prefer with your morning
coffee, the butler to the late Princess Diana was either privy to the
most intimate details of her love life -- quite busy, it turns out --
or a completely barmy employee now peddling exaggerated tales about
the royal family and those in its orbit for the basest of motives:
big money.</LD>
<LD>   In either version, dignity has gone missing.</LD>
<LD>   One week after 44-year-old Paul Burrell walked free from a London
court where he had faced charges of stealing a trove of the princess'
possessions, he has rocked Britain with his butler's-eye view of the
royal family and its tempestuous in-laws, Diana's Spencer family, all
told breathlessly to the Daily Mirror tabloid.</LD>
<TE>   Burrell breaks confidences with the queen. He settles personal
scores with the Spencers, declaring that Diana died deeply estranged
from her family. And in the process, he tramples the memory of the
princess he claims to revere, exposing her deepest secrets -- such as
her wish to marry London surgeon Hasnat Khan -- to anyone with 30
cents to plunk down for paper.</TE>
<TE>   He is taking quite a kicking in return. A tabloid shunned is a
vicious beast, and the papers Burrell turned down to take the
Mirror's cash have a stake in discrediting the butler. "The Ramblings
of a Madman," hollered the Sun in revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Burrell's tale is a surreal account of life behind the
royal moat. He tells of lovers smuggled in the trunks of cars into
Diana's Kensington Palace home; of her mother, Frances Shand Kydd,
screaming a "hate-filled tirade" at her daughter for dating Muslim
men; and of Queen Elizabeth's bizarre warning to him after Diana's
death that there are "powers at work in this country about which we
have no knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most seriously, his revelations triggered a revival of old
whispers about a homosexual rape in Prince Charles' household by a
senior courtier in the late 1980s. This time around, even the
mainstream media gave prominent coverage to the allegations,
accompanied by speculation over whether Prince Charles' staff -- "a
gay mafia," according to the avowedly monarchist Spectator magazine
-- covered up the rape by paying off the victim, whose name was not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to duck the questions, Prince Charles' office issued a
statement late Thursday night saying his staff investigated those
claims in 1996 but found no evidence to support them. Nor did police,
when they conducted their investigation last year.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim did receive a lump payment when he left the
royal household, Charles acknowledged. "But it was not unusual for
the Prince of Wales to make termination payments to employees,"
according to the statement from his office.</TE>
<TE>   All of this seems to go beyond the usual level of delicious royal
gossip, and it seemed to overwhelm the 76-year-old queen. Normally
stoic, she was photographed Thursday with tears running down her
cheeks at Westminster Abbey during a moment's silence for Britain's
war dead.</TE>
<TE>   The tabloid deluge began Nov. 1, when Burrell's theft case was
thrown out of court after the queen intervened. The monarch said she
remembered a 5-year-old private conversation with Burrell -- who had
once been her footman -- during which he told her he was guarding
some of Diana's papers. With that bit of evidence, his trial
collapsed -- a bit suspiciously for some who suggested the monarch's
sudden recall was a convenient way of keeping Burrell's potentially
messy testimony out of court.</TE>
<TE>   But if the queen's intention was to silence the drip of scandal,
the ploy failed. The hyper-competitive British press fell ravenously
on the carcass of the case, and by early this week, Burrell had
signed a deal to tell his story to the Daily Mirror. Throughout his
legal ordeal, Burrell cast himself as a loyal servant to Diana,
explaining that his attic was stuffed with the princess' personal
items because it was his "duty to keep them safe."</TE>
<TE>   But discretion, apparently, has its price. Burrell's turns out to
be a reported $500,000 for the newspaper version and $150,000 for a
television interview.</TE>
<TE>   The first tabloid installment, published Wednesday, recounted
Burrell's now-infamous meeting with the queen, held on a November
afternoon after Diana's August 1997 death. Their talk lasted three
hours, he said. Buckingham Palace sources scoff at the notion that
the queen would grant anyone less than a head of state more than 20
minutes. Three minutes at most, they say.</TE>
<TE>   His aim in keeping Diana's things, Burrell said he told the queen,
was to prevent the princess' shredder-happy family from destroying
her letters and "erasing part of the princess' life."</TE>
<TE>   It was, he recounted, "like talking to my mum."</TE>
<TE>   Nine or 10 corgis "were strewn around the room," Burrell recalled,
when the queen made her mysterious statement he roughly translated
as: Beware the dark forces. The queen "looked at me over her
half-rimmed spectacles as if she expected me to know the rest. She
fixed me with her eye and made sure I knew she was being deadly
serious ... clearly warning me to be vigilant. I had no idea what she
was talking about," he told the Mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell went on to skewer the Spencer family on Thursday. "The
Spencers found Diana unacceptable in life," he declared. "But after
her death, they found her very acceptable at 10.50 pounds [$15] a
ticket." A not-very-nice reference to the Spencer family having
turned Diana's burial plot on its estate into a tourist destination.</TE>
<TE>   But the butler saved his harshest opinions for Diana's mother and
sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale (he calls her "McCrocodile"), whom he
blames for pushing the prosecution against him. He took his revenge
by revealing that six months before her death, Diana allowed him to
listen in on a phone conversation with her mother during which a
"slurring" Shand Kydd uncorked a "hate-filled personal attack on the
type of men the princess surrounded herself with and their religious
beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   A sobbing Diana, "contorted by hurt, vowed she would never speak
to her mother again," Burrell told the Mirror. "And she never did."</TE>

<HD>State's Jobless Rate Unchanged at 6.4%</HD>
<DH>October data show the unemployment figure holding steady
for a fourth month. Labor force is growing faster than the number of
jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's labor markets continued to tread water in October.</LD>
<LD>   The state's unemployment rate held steady at 6.4%, where it has
been for four months, according to a report released Friday by the
Employment Development Department.</LD>
<LD>   A separate survey of employers showed that the state added nearly
20,000 jobs in October. That outpaced the nation, which saw payrolls
decline by 5,000 jobs last month. But California's employment gains
weren't enough to make a dent in the state's jobless rate because the
labor force is growing faster than employers are adding positions.</LD>
<TE>   Though analysts welcomed signs of employment growth, they
expressed caution about reading too much into one month's data.
Seasonal factors accounted for much of the gain, with government --
mainly public schools -- accounting for four of five jobs added.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said California can't count on the public sector to be its
engine of job growth given the budget woes roiling federal, state and
local coffers. Bedrock industries such as manufacturing and high tech
continued to shed jobs last month, and employers in other industries
remained reluctant to do much hiring.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that the public sector is going to be financially
strapped over the next year," said UCLA economist Tom Lieser. "We
need to see more of an indication that the private sector is coming
back."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, signs of a weak labor market abound:</TE>
<TE>   * California has 23,100 fewer jobs than it did in October 2001,
when its unemployment rate was 5.9%.</TE>
<TE>   * More than 1.1 million state residents are unemployed, and they
are remaining jobless longer. In October, 18.5% of unemployed
Californians had been jobless 27 weeks or longer -- a four-year high.</TE>
<TE>   * October marked the third straight month that unemployment for
nonwhites in California was at 8.5%, the highest it has been since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   * Average weekly hours in manufacturing fell to 40.6 in October
from 40.9 in September, as did overtime hours and earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi said war jitters,
sliding consumer confidence and poor corporate earnings have spooked
employers, who aren't likely to boost their payrolls substantially
amid so much uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode," Adibi said. "There isn't
enough energy in the economy to create jobs any faster."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was some good news to be gleaned from October's
employment report. Six of the eight major sectors tracked by the EDD
gained jobs during the month.</TE>
<TE>   Government led the way, with an increase of 15,700 jobs. The
wholesale and retail trades added 6,400 positions. Finance, insurance
and real estate gained 2,800. Transportation and public utilities
increased by 2,200 jobs, and mining added 100 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The giant services sector added a net 5,500 jobs, led by gains in
health services, social services and motion pictures. However,
business services, which include high-paying technology jobs, shed
3,800 positions over the month.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturing sector slashed 8,100 jobs in October, with those
losses split almost evenly between makers of durable goods and makers
of nondurable goods. The beleaguered sector has shed jobs in 20 of
the last 21 months.</TE>
<TE>   The construction sector also lost jobs, dropping 4,800 positions
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California remains the state's job engine. Last month,
the region added 25,400 nonfarm payroll jobs, led by Los Angeles
County, which gained 14,000 jobs, most of them in the public schools.
Despite a slow economy, Southern California has 17,700 more payroll
jobs than it did in October 2001. In contrast, the Bay Area has lost
67,600 jobs over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's unemployment rate fell to 6.1% in October
from a revised 6.5% in September. Orange County's rate declined to 4%
last month from 4.1% in September. Riverside County's jobless rate
fell to 6.5% in October from 6.6% the previous month. San Bernardino
County's rate held steady at 5.6%, as did San Diego County's at 4.2%.
Ventura County's jobless rate declined to 5.4% in October from 5.8%
in September.</TE>
<TE>   Among California counties, San Luis Obispo posted the lowest
October unemployment rate at 3.3%, and Imperial posted the highest at
21.9%.</TE>

<HD>3 Power Firms Subpoenaed in Calif. Probe</HD>
<DH>Federal prosecutors seek records from Duke, AES and
Williams in a grand jury's investigation into manipulation of the
state's energy market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling the widening of a grand jury investigation into the alleged
manipulation of electricity prices in California, federal prosecutors
issued subpoenas for documents Friday to at least three major players
in the state's power markets.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Energy Corp., AES Corp. and Williams Cos. each said they
received subpoenas from the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "It's related to our activities in the California market," said
Pat Mullen, spokesman for Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy. "As with
all of the government inquiries and investigations, we will cooperate
fully."</LD>
<TE>   Mullen declined to elaborate on what types of records the
subpoenas seek or what time period they cover. Representatives of AES
and Williams also wouldn't provide such details. Williams markets
electricity produced by AES plants in California.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for U.S. Atty. Kevin V. Ryan declined to comment,
citing legal restrictions on discussing grand jury activities.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Houston-based Dynegy Inc., Atlanta-based Mirant
Corp. and Houston-based Reliant Resources Inc. -- all large power
suppliers to the state -- said they were unaware of any subpoenas
received by their companies. A spokeswoman for Calpine Corp. would
not comment on whether the San Jose company had received a subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of subpoenas follows by less than a month the only
admission yet of illegal activity during California's energy crisis
of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s top Western trader, Timothy N. Belden, pleaded
guilty Oct. 17 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco to one count
of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, saying he had conspired to lie to
power authorities in order to boost earnings for the company. Belden
headed Enron's electricity trading operation in Portland, Ore., and
is believed to have masterminded Enron trading strategies with
colorful nicknames such as Fat Boy, Death Star and Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   Belden agreed to cooperate with investigators in the 5-month-old
inquiry. The next day, Ryan and San Francisco FBI chief Mark Mershon
publicly warned other energy traders that they were coming after
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who is playing the piano, but it sounds like Timmy
Boy is singing," said a source close to one of the separate state
investigations into California market manipulation. Belden's
attorney, Cristina Arguedas, declined to discuss what Belden may be
sharing with federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's office in August subpoenaed trading records from the
California Independent System Operator, which runs the transmission
grid for most of the state. The subpoena sought electricity forecasts
filed by power sellers with the grid operator, the records of
electricity flows and any payments made to traders under a complex
system to relieve electricity traffic jams on the grid.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoenas are another piece of bad news for the battered
energy trading industry, which has shriveled by more than half since
the collapse late last year of Enron, once the world's largest energy
trader. Revelations of questionable trading ploys by Enron and
others, accounting scandals, tight credit and low power prices have
decimated the business.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, El Paso Corp. became the latest big-name trading
company to announce it was quitting the sector.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would see this," said Gary Ackerman, executive
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group that
represents many of the companies now besieged. "It's like economic
McCarthyism out there: 'I am not now nor have I ever been an energy
trader.' "</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based El Paso, which reported a third-quarter net loss of
$69 million on sales of $2.7 billion, said it would spin off its
trading operation to a partnership that would liquidate the portfolio
in the next two years. The reason for the move, El Paso President
Brent Austin said, was to eliminate a major drag on corporate
earnings. A year ago, the natural gas pipeline operator posted net
income of $211 million on sales of $3.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a spokesman for California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
confirmed that talks were being conducted with El Paso to settle
lawsuits accusing the company of withholding natural gas from the
state during the energy crisis and of conspiring with others to limit
competition in the pipeline business. The talks were first reported
Friday by the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Chief Executive William A. Wise declined to comment on the
negotiations but noted that the company has a history of settling
such matters if it makes sense for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "We do understand the difference between litigating till the cows
come home and getting these things behind us," Wise said Friday
during a conference call with investors.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso shares fell $1.52 to $7.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Duke lost 85 cents to $19.96, AES finished 7 cents higher at $1.99,
and Williams was off 45 cents to $2.61, all on the NYSE. Disclosure
of the subpoenas came after the close of the market.</TE>

<LD>Shares of discount merchant Factory 2-U Stores Inc. more than doubled
Friday after the appointment of onetime Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief
Executive William R. Fields as the company's chairman and CEO.</LD>
<LD>   Factory 2-U, which made the announcement after markets closed
Thursday, saw its stock jump $2.77 to close at $4.45 on Nasdaq on
Friday. The stock hit a 52-week low just a few weeks ago, closing at
$1.11 on Oct. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based chain of 261 discount stores, formerly known
as Family Bargain, operates mostly in strip malls, selling clothing
and household merchandise it buys from close-out sales and inventory
excesses it acquires from manufacturers and other retailers.</LD>
<TE>   Fields, 53, was CEO of Wal-Mart from 1993 to 1996. Most recently,
he was CEO of Apec China Asset Management Ltd. He also has headed
Canadian department store Hudson's Bay Co. and Blockbuster
Entertainment Group.</TE>
<TE>   Fields is replacing Mike Searles, Factory 2-U's CEO since 1998. A
company spokesman said only that Searles, who previously held
executive posts at Montgomery Ward Inc. and Toys R Us Inc.'s Kids R
Us division, has left the company.</TE>
<TE>   Factory 2-U's sales, which totaled $580 million last year, have
shrunk in recent quarters and the company has been losing money. The
stock has plunged from a peak of $43 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Factory 2-U was founded by Norman Weinstein, who started General
Textiles by selling clothes at swap meets. Weinstein opened his first
Family Bargain store in 1979.</TE>

<HD>A Single-Minded Focus on Multiple Threads</HD>
<DH>In developing a radical new technology, Intel designers and
engineers had to change the way they thought about chips.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking tradition is nothing new for Deborah T. Marr. The Cornell
graduate is one of a handful of female computer chip designers in a
field that is 95% male.</LD>
<LD>   So when Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker,
embraced a radical new design for its microprocessors, it turned to
the tenacious 36-year-old mother of two to push the technology out of
the lab and into PCs.</LD>
<LD>   The product of Marr's three-year effort is expected to debut next
week in the form of a 3-gigahertz Pentium 4 chip that the Santa
Clara-based company boasts is the fastest commercial microprocessor
for personal computers.</LD>
<TE>   The phenomenal speed of the processor is less significant than the
way it works.</TE>
<TE>   It relies on a technology Intel calls Hyper-Threading -- a radical
concept that makes a single computer chip act like two. That notion,
however simple, defies the entire architecture of computers, which
excel at executing instructions one at a time, millions of times a
second.</TE>
<TE>   "Hyper-Threading is like giving a cook two pans to work with
instead of one," said Brian Fravel, Intel's marketing manager for
desktop chips. "It's not as fast as having two cooks, each with his
own pan. But it's also not as expensive because you're only paying
one cook."</TE>
<TE>   Like chips, the people who make them generally tackle work in
sequence, one task after another. Building a new kind of chip
required a new kind of thinking. For order-loving geeks, it was a
tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Marr, who joined Intel in 1988 and whom a colleague
describes as the "conscience of Hyper-Threading."</TE>
<TE>   Her journey demonstrates how Intel was able to introduce a
technology that defied its decades of monomaniacal focus on building
smaller, faster chip transistors, an endless cycle predicted by
company co-founder Gordon Moore and later referred to as Moore's Law.
Instead, Hyper-Threading turns Moore's Law on its head by making
existing chips work more efficiently instead of just throwing more
transistors into a chip.</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge with Hyper-Threading is its unproven nature.
When the concept was floated in the early 1990s, no one knew exactly
how it would perform in the real world, and many still are uncertain
how much benefit it will provide. Intel claims the process boosts a
computer's performance by 25%. Independent tests meant to simulate
real-world computer use yielded mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   That uncertainty, combined with a natural reluctance to change,
meant Marr had her work cut out for her when she joined the Pentium 4
team as an architect in 1996. By then, the corporate decision already
had been made to incorporate Hyper-Threading into the Pentium 4.</TE>
<TE>   The idea began with Glenn Hinton, 45, one of Intel's top engineers
in charge of designing chips at the company's campus in Hillsboro,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Hinton had been thinking since the late 1980s of ways to give a
chip the ability to tackle more than one task by splitting its
resources. When he worked on a project to make a smaller version of a
chip in 1992, he noticed that slicing the chip in half slowed things
only 25% to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it hit me: If I could get two threads executing at the same
time, each thread getting half the chip's resources, I could improve
performance 1 1/2 times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional chips crunch only one program at any given point in
time. Computers give the illusion of running more than one program by
rapidly switching from one to another. But because the chip is
working only on a single program at any instant, only about a third
of its transistors on average are engaged at once. The rest sit idle.</TE>
<TE>   Hyper-Threading lets chips work on two programs at once and make
better use of all of a chip's transistors. Although not as fast as
two chips, it's also not as expensive.</TE>
<TE>   A chip with Hyper-Threading is about 5% larger than one without.
And in the world of semiconductors, size relates directly to cost.
Larger chips are more expensive both to produce and to use because
they require so much power.</TE>
<TE>   Hinton began to champion the idea when discussions about the
Pentium 4 took place in 1993. People were starting to use their
computers to do several things at once.</TE>
<TE>   Operating systems, especially Microsoft Corp.'s Windows, were
finally capable of exploiting dual-chip PCs. Software engineers were
beginning to write programs in ways that would take advantage of
multiple processors.</TE>
<TE>   Hinton also was helped by two papers published in 1995 and 1996 by
University of Washington researcher Dean Tullsen, who first simulated
a chip capable of processing multiple streams of instructions
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the company gave Hinton the green light. He paired up
with Marr, whom he had met on an earlier chip project.</TE>
<TE>   Hinton and Marr were a study in contrasts.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 foot 2 and loquacious, Hinton was constantly throwing off
ideas, cornering engineers in the hallway to talk about a new thought
he just had. Intel workers who showed up late for meetings would say
they had run into Hinton and would get understanding nods.</TE>
<TE>   Marr, a 5-foot-5, 105-pound daughter of Chinese immigrants from
Shanghai, was quiet, focused and methodical. She wasn't shy in open
debate, but Marr preferred more strategic routes, recruiting her
allies in advance of crucial meetings. She hated surprises, and was
the type to know exactly how a meeting would turn out even before it
began.</TE>
<TE>   Marr came to believe in Hinton's ideas, and Hinton respected
Marr's ability to get things done.</TE>
<TE>   To create a chip like the Pentium 4 takes thousands of engineers.
For Hyper-Threading to work, every person at every step of the way
had to buy into the technology. Implementing it required retooling
every aspect of the chip to make it behave as if it were two.</TE>
<TE>   Before design work could begin, though, Marr had to plow through
thousands of pages of technical documents covering all the functions
of the Pentium 4. Then she had to rework each of them so the new chip
would know how to handle two jobs instead of one.</TE>
<TE>   Once the new rules were in place, Marr had to make sure all the
engineers built them into their designs.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say I'm an engineer, working on my part of the chip,"
Hinton said. "I've got hundreds of things to do to meet my milestone.
The camel's back is about to break. The tendency is to work on the
things I know have to get done anyway and put off things I think are
optional -- like Hyper-Threading -- until tomorrow or next week."</TE>
<TE>   Marr stayed on top of the engineers, wheedling, lobbying and
guilt-tripping them into moving Hyper-Threading tasks higher on their
priority list day after day.</TE>
<TE>   She marched groups of engineers through intensive weeklong
seminars on Hyper-Threading to get them focused.</TE>
<TE>   "It became an obsession for me," Marr recalled. "People would tell
me it's just a job, but that only made me more stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   Working against her was the fact that the concept ran against the
grain of how engineers like to think -- that is, in a single
sequence.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a fundamental shift in mind-set," Marr said. "A lot of
the rules you had all of a sudden don't work anymore. A very large
number of algorithms had to be rethought."</TE>
<TE>   Intel executives acknowledge that the concept will be as much of a
challenge to sell to consumers as it was for Marr to push to
engineers. Consumers have been trained to pay attention to the speed
of a chip, measured in megahertz.</TE>
<TE>   Hyper-Threading has nothing to do with megahertz. Instead, it has
to do with getting the same number of megahertz to perform more work,
even as chip speeds continue to power forward.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of consumers don't want or need a 2-gigahertz
processor, much less a 3-gigahertz chip with Hyper-Threading," said
Kevin Krewell, senior analyst of Microprocessor Report, an industry
newsletter that nevertheless gave Hyper-Threading an award last year
for best new technology.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's unclear how much benefit Hyper-Threading will
actually deliver.</TE>
<TE>   In a small number of cases, it may even slow overall performance.
Because one thread can sometimes monopolize a chip, there are times
when the second thread is stalled while it waits for its turn,
causing the computer to perform more poorly with Hyper-Threading than
without.</TE>
<TE>   Intel is working with companies such as Microsoft and Adobe
Systems Inc., the maker of Photoshop image-editing software, to
anticipate and circumvent such bottlenecks.</TE>
<TE>   Marr, who gave birth to her second child this week, is
characteristically undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that this technology is revolutionary and that
it will greatly improve how computers serve us," she said.</TE>

<HD>Lincoln Mercury to Leave Irvine</HD>
<DH>The Ford division, which moved west four years ago in
search of a new identity, will return to Michigan next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln Mercury unit, which relocated from Michigan
to Southern California four years ago in search of a soul, is going
back home.</LD>
<LD>   Employees at Lincoln Mercury's world headquarters in Irvine were
given the news during a staff meeting Friday morning: All 90 will be
offered relocation assistance, and some jobs will remain in Southern
California. But as of next summer the world headquarters for Ford's
upscale domestic brands will be back in Dearborn.</LD>
<LD>   Lincoln Mercury's move to Southern California in the summer of
1998 was hailed by economic development specialists as a boon to the
region.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the move was followed by Ford's decision to relocate the
North American headquarters of its Premier Automotive Group -- which
consists of Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo -- and its 500
employees to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Those companies brought with them a host of suppliers, including
advertising and marketing specialists. Most of those firms are
expected to stay in the region, but Lincoln spokeswoman Nancy Carollo
said Friday that about 50 contract employees, many of them with the
Irvine office of advertising firm Young &amp; Rubicam, will be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's European brands, grouped under the Premier Automotive
banner, will remain in the five-story glass-and- concrete
headquarters the company opened in Irvine a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mazda North American Operations, the U.S. arm of Ford-controlled
Mazda Motor Corp., also will remain in Irvine, where it has been
since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln Mercury's relocation was accompanied by a blaze of
headlines and pronouncements that the stagnant division was moving
west to find a new, modern American identity in a more culturally
diverse locale.</TE>
<TE>   The region is home to the U.S. headquarters of eight Asian
automakers, including Japan's Big Three: Toyota Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California also boasts 19 automotive design studios, the
biggest automotive design school in the country and several thousand
automotive performance and appearance equipment manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an argument for going to California," said Michael
Flynn, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study
of Automotive Transportation. "Lincoln Mercury wasn't out there long
enough to see if it paid off."</TE>
<TE>   But Ford, which was riding high when the move was made, soon began
foundering amid numerous model recalls, slumping sales and financial
losses. Insiders said the automaker never supported the unit with the
logistical underpinnings needed to make it work.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lincoln Mercury's top administrative and marketing people
moved to Irvine, Ford kept the product planners, designers, engineers
and manufacturing specialists in Dearborn.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving here was a bold attempt to do something different," said
George Peterson, a former Lincoln executive who is president of
AutoPacific Inc., an automotive-marketing consulting firm in Tustin.
"But it is hard to get Detroit-oriented management people to do
business in a different way. My sense is that it has pretty much been
business as usual since they moved out here."</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln sales have dropped almost 5% since the move, and Mercury
sales are off about 28%.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Hazel, who has been Lincoln Mercury president since August,
is the third to hold that post since the 1998 move. He said returning
to Dearborn "is the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   He said that despite his predecessors' pronouncements that being
in California had opened their eyes to new possibilities for the
Lincoln and Mercury brands, he didn't believe the move made "any huge
change in the way we look at and approach the market."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, local economists and Irvine city officials said
the unit's departure would not spell disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "In numerical terms this is not a big impact," said Irvine Mayor
Larry Agran. "But, of course, it is always unfortunate when a
prestigious automaker leaves your community and heads back to
Detroit."</TE>

<HD>Rally Fades as Big Names Pull Down Wall St. Indexes</HD>
<DH>Pessimistic outlooks from McDonald's and other firms prompt
a round of profit taking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks lost more ground Friday, with the broad market snapping a
four-week winning streak, as a dour outlook from McDonald's and other
sour corporate news fueled worries that the U.S. economic recovery
may be stalling.</LD>
<LD>   In other markets, long-term bond yields fell further and the euro
hit its highest level against the dollar since early 2000. Traders
said those markets were reacting in part to the Federal Reserve's
surprise decision Wednesday to cut its key short-term rate from 1.75%
to a 41-year low of 1.25%.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's corporate news helped persuade jittery investors to book
more profits from a monthlong rally that had lifted major stock
gauges 20% or more from five-year lows hit in early October.</LD>
<TE>   "The overwhelming majority of fairly sophisticated investors say
they do not trust the rally," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp. "They believe the U.S. economy is
heading for trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, market players gave mixed views about a U.N. resolution
to disarm Iraq. Some said it had little effect on stocks. Others said
it reminded Wall Street that U.S. military action would be more
likely if Iraq President Saddam Hussein failed to comply.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weighing on the market temporarily," said Ron Doran,
director of institutional trading at C.L. King &amp; Associates." But
it's a long-term positive.... Whatever takes place, if there is
disarming by himself or if we have to disarm him, there's a solution
and everyone's on board."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials fell 49.11 points, or 0.6%, to 8,537.13,
although it managed to salvage a slim 0.2% gain for the week,
extending its winning streak to five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 17.43 points, or 1.3%, to
1,359.28. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gave up 7.91 points, or
0.9%, to 894.74. Both finished fractionally lower for the week,
ending four weeks of gains.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's market action, which saw losers outnumber winners by
about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, was marked by
sharp moves in some big-name stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Dow component McDonald's lost $1.52 to $17.79 after saying it
would close about 175 restaurants worldwide and miss its 2002
earnings estimate as it continues to struggle with under-performing
U.S. sales.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric fell $1.01 to $25.10 after a J.P. Morgan analyst
spooked investors when he said the firm may have to contribute as
much as $5 billion in equity to shore up the balance sheet of GE
Capital because the finance arm has a higher debt ratio than
previously assumed.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet plummeted $13.05 to $14.90 amid the hospital giant's
deepening problems. That slammed other hospital and HMO stocks as
well. But an initial public offering from New York HMO WellChoice
rose to $27.20 from its IPO price of $25.</TE>
<TE>   Among supermarkets, Safeway sank $2.60 to $20 as the company
forecast weaker results.</TE>
<TE>   In currency and bond markets, traders appeared to view the Fed's
rate cut as a worrisome sign of a weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury note yield slid to 3.84% from
3.88%. The euro jumped to $1.013, up from $1.009 and the highest
since early 2000, according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors can't get excited about being in the U.S. dollar" with
short-term rates so low, said Emeric Challier, who helps oversee $8
billion at Societe Generale Asset Management in Paris.</TE>

<HD>Pitt Defends His Tenure at the SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, who
submitted his resignation Tuesday, defended his 15-month tenure and
said a "climate of attack and partisanship" undercut his work.</LD>
<LD>   "In a partisan environment, criticism often devolves into attack,"
Pitt said Friday in a speech to the Securities Industry Assn., the
trade group for Wall Street investment firms. "It's not just
unproductive. It's counterproductive."</LD>
<LD>   Pitt listed his accomplishments, including a rule that executives
certify financial statements, reopening markets after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and charging WorldCom Inc. with fraud 24 hours
after it restated earnings. He didn't mention his handling of William
Webster's appointment to lead a new accounting board, which led to
his resignation.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt's speech was his first public address since tendering his
resignation. Pitt remains chairman until a successor is announced by
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's speech was greeted by a 20-second standing ovation from 300
brokers attending the meeting. Reporters were unable to ask follow-up
questions as Pitt was escorted out of the building by four security
guards.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC chairman, who was appointed by Bush last year and won
unanimous Senate confirmation, came under criticism for his past ties
to the accounting industry and a series of missteps, including
meetings with executives of KPMG and other companies under SEC
investigation.</TE>

<LD>Nvidia Corp. engineer Robert Prevett was found guilty by a federal
jury in San Jose of illegally profiting from stock trades before the
firm announced a contract to provide graphics chips to Microsoft
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Prevett, 38, faces a $1-million fine and up to 10 years in prison
for buying 10,000 Nvidia shares using insider knowledge four days
before the contract to make chips for the Xbox video game system was
announced March 10, 2000. He made $595,000 from trades in Nvidia
shares. Prevett's attorney said he would appeal.</LD>

<LD>   Joseph Perrone, formerly executive vice president of finance, was
moved to the newly created position of executive vice president of
business performance, according to an internal announcement.</LD>
<LD>   Perrone joined Global Crossing from Arthur Andersen and was
instrumental in shaping the controversial accounting practices that
later sparked investigations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and others. In addition, creditors are investigating a
deal between Global Crossing and Withit, a company run by Perrone's
son that received at least $740,000 in payments from Global Crossing
before it filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>

<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it plans to lay off an additional
2,700 flight attendants because of reductions in its 2003 flight
schedule as the airline tries to lower costs.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts, which begin Jan. 31, bring the total number of
attendants laid off to 4,800, the airline said. Calls to UAL weren't
returned, and a message on an after-hours media line said the company
had no additional comment. Calls to the Assn. of Flight Attendants,
the union that represents United cabin crew, weren't returned. UAL's
shares fell 63 cents, or 16%, to $3.28 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The announcement was made after markets closed.</LD>

<LD>Fleming Cos., the largest U.S. grocery distributor, is nearing an
agreement to sell 28 of its California supermarkets to Save Mart
Supermarkets for about $150 million in cash and long-term
liabilities, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Modesto-based Save Mart also agreed to make Fleming the primary
supplier to the stores. Fleming is selling 110 Food 4 Less and
Rainbow Foods supermarkets so it can invest more in its distribution

<HD>Safeway Lowers Forecasts for 4th Quarter and Beyond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sluggish economy is eating into the earnings of Safeway Inc., the
nation's third-largest supermarket chain.</LD>
<LD>   The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company, which operates the Vons
chain in Southern California, said Friday that profit will be less
than expected in the fourth quarter and into next year.</LD>
<LD>   "The current economy has continued to impact our business, and it
is unclear when consumer confidence will strengthen," Steve Burd,
chairman and chief executive of the nearly 1,800-store grocery chain,
said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Safeway trimmed its fourth-quarter earnings expectations to 78
cents to 80 cents a share. Six weeks ago, the company anticipated
fourth-quarter profit of 82 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The grocery company now expects to end the year with per-share
earnings in the $2.77 to $2.79 range and expects to make $2.50 to
$2.65 a share in 2003. Both are below the consensus estimates of
$2.81 for 2002 and $2.92 for next year, according to an analyst
survey by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Safeway fell 11.5%, or $2.60, on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at $20, a six-year low. The company's shares have
fallen 52% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Burd said Safeway plans to improve its selection of products in an
effort to draw customers back to its supermarkets. He called 2003 a
"rebuilding year." Safeway is the third of the top three domestic
supermarket chains to lower its profit forecasts in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   A migration of consumers to big discount chains such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and warehouse retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp.
has hurt Safeway, market leader Albertson's Inc. and second-place
Kroger Co., which owns the Ralphs chain.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, changing consumer buying patterns, including
customers purchasing less expensive brands or products instead of
higher-profit items, have hurt the big supermarket chains, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's shares fell 3.6% to $19.82 on the Safeway news. Kroger
stock dipped 5.9% to $14.10. Both trade on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Syncor's Stock Further Battered</HD>
<DH>Lawsuits are filed on behalf of shareholders amid probe of
possible bribery. Shares fall 19%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock of nuclear-medicine provider Syncor International Corp.
melted down for a third day Friday as lawsuits seeking class-action
status accused the company of misleading shareholders by concealing
the payment of bribes overseas.</LD>
<LD>   Woodland Hills-based Syncor said Wednesday that its founder, Monty
Fu, and his brother Moses Fu, who ran the company's foreign
operations, have been put on leave while a board committee
investigates payments to customers in China, Taiwan and other
countries. It said the payments may have violated U.S. and foreign
laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans bribes.</LD>
<LD>   Syncor shares fell $4.31 Friday, or 19%, to $18.37 on Nasdaq,
closing the week down 50%.</LD>
<TE>   Syncor agreed in June to a takeover by drug wholesaler Cardinal
Health Inc. in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. The deal is on hold
while both firms investigate Syncor's business practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are concerned about the outcome of the merger,"
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analyst Andrew Speller told Reuters on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Chief Executive Robert Walker said Wednesday that
Syncor's pharmacies, which dispense radioactive drugs that help
doctors treat illnesses, are a good fit for Cardinal, but he said top
priority was to protect its reputation. Cardinal wouldn't comment
further Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The law firms Levy &amp; Levy in Stamford, Conn., Abbey Gardy in New
York and Brian M. Felgoise in Philadelphia said Friday that they had
filed claims in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles seeking damages on
behalf of shareholders. In a statement, the Levy firm said Syncor's
news releases and financial filings were materially misleading
because they failed to disclose that Monty and Moses Fu "were making
illegal payments to Syncor's overseas customers."</TE>
<TE>   Syncor spokesman Allen Mayer declined comment on the stock price
and lawsuits. He said Syncor is sharing details of its internal
investigation with the Justice Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor hopes to wrap up its investigation by Dec. 6, when its
shareholders are to vote on Cardinal's buyout, Mayer said.</TE>

<HD>Shares of Tenet Fall on Cuts in Ratings</HD>
<DH>S&amp;P and analysts downgrade the hospital company's debt and
outlook as probe grows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crisis at Tenet Healthcare Corp. deepened Friday as a number of
analysts and a leading credit rating firm downgraded the Santa
Barbara-based company, sending its already battered stock plunging
and triggering investor concerns about the entire hospital sector.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet shares fell 47% a day after the nation's second-largest
hospital operator overhauled senior management and revealed how its
aggressive pricing strategy allowed it to collect an unusually large
amount of special Medicare payments, which federal regulators are
preparing to audit.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital pricing has become a growing issue nationally, as the
cost of health care has soared in recent years. Some analysts said
the scrutiny of Tenet could spread to other companies and spur
changes in government reimbursements to hospitals. Those concerns led
to a sell-off of hospital stocks, including HCA Inc. and Triad
Hospitals Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "Tenet's issues are resonating so deeply in the sector that they
remind investors that acute-care hospitals are highly regulated and
bound by Medicare rules," said Darren Lehrich, an analyst at SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lehrich said that with other hospital companies, "I don't
foresee any specific problems like those we're seeing with Tenet."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital firms such as Tenet have enjoyed robust earnings growth
and soaring stock prices in the last year. But Tenet's stock has
fallen 70% in the last two weeks, or about $16 billion in market
value, amid questions about its hospital billing practices and a
federal probe of two doctors at a facility in Redding. Tenet operates
113 general hospitals, including 40 in California.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, in Redding, three more people filed lawsuits against
Tenet, Redding Medical Center and the two doctors, Chae Hyun Moon and
Fidel Realyvasquez Jr. All three plaintiffs claimed fraud, and one
blamed the death of a 74-year-old man, Cecil Josefsson, on an
allegedly unnecessary coronary bypass surgery performed this year at
Redding Medical. The suit was filed by the man's son, Peter
Josefsson, who, through his lawyer, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI is investigating whether Moon, head of cardiology at
Redding Medical, and Realyvasquez, the hospital's chairman of cardiac
surgery, performed hundreds of unnecessary heart procedures for which
the two doctors billed Medicare millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Moon and Realyvasquez have said their clients have
done nothing wrong. No charges have been filed against them. Tenet
has not been named in the federal probe.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the California attorney general's office filed papers
in Shasta County requesting court approval to prevent Moon and
Realyvasquez from practicing medicine pending the outcome of the
investigation. A hearing is expected Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's legal problems were among the factors cited by Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. on Friday for lowering its debt rating to just a notch
above "junk-bond" status. The rating cut is likely to make it more
costly for Tenet to borrow money.</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 other analysts Friday downgraded Tenet's stock, which
lost $13.05 to close at $14.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. More
than 114 million shares changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials, in a long conference call with investors after
the close of markets Thursday, revealed that in the last fiscal year
the company received $763 million in special Medicare reimbursements
called "outlier payments." These payments are made in addition to
fixed Medicare payments for hospital services and are intended to
help hospitals defray expenses for unusually costly procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it did not break Medicare rules, but analysts
said Tenet unfairly took advantage of Medicare's outlier payment
formula to reap excessive reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said Friday that the company
"absolutely did not" deliberately raise prices to maximize its
special Medicare payments.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Jeffrey Barbakow, Tenet's chairman and chief
executive, learned in the last two weeks that aggressive pricing was
leading to big increases in outlier payments. Barbakow then
confronted Chief Financial Officer David Dennis and Chief Operating
Officer Thomas Mackey last week. He told them that he had lost
confidence in them and requested they leave the firm, according to
Anderson.</TE>

<LD>Valley secession -- A map in the Thursday California section showing
the vote on San Fernando Valley secession incorrectly used a
calculation based on the total ballots cast in each precinct, rather
than ballots cast on the secession measure. The overall pattern shown
on the published map is correct, but in a few parts of the East
Valley and the Westside, the calculation error resulted in precincts
being placed in the wrong category. A corrected map can be viewed on
the Times' Web site at http://www.latimes.com/secession.</LD>

<DH>Now that he has experienced college life, Carroll sees no
reason to return to the NFL</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Pete Carroll had gotten the call, if he'd found out then what he
knows now, he could have been wearing a Stanford headset and colors
for the Trojans' visit to Palo Alto today.</LD>
<LD>   He lost out to Dennis Green for the Cardinal head coaching job 14
years ago, and he didn't come close or even give much thought to
another college coaching job in the years afterward.</LD>
<LD>   How could Pete Carroll not see it? Wasn't it obvious, with his
youthful enthusiasm and rah-rah attitude, that this guy was meant to
be a college coach?</LD>
<TE>   His friends in the coaching profession, even the one they called a
genius, kept telling him: "You ought to coach in college."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll would allow it for a quick moment -- "That'd be fun," he'd
say -- then drop it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing the NFL thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People around me had a better sense than I did about how it would
fit."</TE>
<TE>   So he did the NFL thing in Buffalo and Minnesota, where he coached
the defensive backs. He did it with the New York Jets, where he spent
four years running around the sidelines as a defensive coordinator
before he got a head-coaching shot that lasted all of one season.</TE>
<TE>   He served more time as a defensive coordinator in San Francisco,
got one more chance as a head coach in New England. When that candle
burned out after three seasons, it didn't look as if he'd get another
shot. NFL coaches who've never won a playoff game don't get multiple
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   He was doing NFL consulting work when the Trojans' coaching search
stumbled its way toward him after Paul Hackett was dumped after the
2000 season. Sure, he'd take it. Might be a good way to make some
headway back into the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The pit stop, though, might become a long residency. Carroll's
style is working. And he's loving it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place where I can feel the most freedom," he said. "I
have no aspirations of going anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "I like creating all the stuff we create. We love recruiting and
finding my football team. There's no aspects of it that I'm finding
to taint all of it."</TE>
<TE>   Not even the hard-to-please alumni and boosters, the ones who
can't get John McKay and Student Body Right out of their heads?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big deal to me," Carroll said. "I've already been
through the scrutiny and stuff. With every job makeup, there's
problems that make it more difficult, whether it's the [salary] cap
in the NFL or academics [in college].</TE>
<TE>   "You have your stuff that you have to deal with. To me it's just
part of the makeup of the job. I'm not going to let that aspect of it
take me out of it."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way he talks. All positive, lots of "stuff" and a
surfer-style use of "way," as in "way better."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow it all works. After bouncing back from a 1-4 start to
finish 6-6 last season, the Trojans are 6-2, in the hunt for the Rose
Bowl and ranked 10th in the country. Six of his eight losses in two
years were by five points or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   The players see him out there in practice, running around in the
thick of things, and they buy into his program. At least the star
quarterback does.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unbelievable," Carson Palmer said. "He's gonna turn this
whole thing around. I wish I could be a part of it the next couple
years. He's going to get a national championship, he's going to get
Rose Bowls, he's going to get all of that.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going have great recruiting classes. Whether we win this
next four or lose this next four, people are going to want to play
for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm jealous of these freshmen coming in, because they have a
chance to be a part of something amazing.</TE>
<TE>   "What you realize is that he cares about everybody, whether you're
John the walk-on or a superstar. He's so proud to be here that he
makes you want to play for him, he makes you want to win for him."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Carroll wishes Palmer, Sultan McCullough, Kareem Kelly
and Troy Polamalu could stick around and be a part of it. Carroll has
recruited well -- particularly on defense -- and expanded the
Trojans' recruiting base, but his biggest challenge will be landing
replacements at the skill positions on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting is the lifeblood of any college program. It's something
that suits Carroll well, and something that fits in with desire to
run the show.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason that this suits me better than any other situation is
that I'm in total control of what I'm doing," he said. "I've been
coaching a long time, I've been through a lot of experiences, I have
a lot of stuff that I want to express in my program. I don't want
anybody looking over my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "No owners, no GMs, no cap guys. I don't have to deal with any of
that stuff. I make all the decisions myself. I feel confident that
I'm going to make good ones."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the decision to keep living the college life looks
easy. He enjoys all the aspects of it and being a part of the Trojan
athletic community. He can check out a couple of innings of the
baseball game, or watch the track team.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter is a junior at USC who played on the women's
volleyball team, and they sometimes meet for lunch on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside of that is, I cramp her style some," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's style still fits at USC. Bill Walsh, one of the guys who
advised him to coach college, was right. Of course, Walsh was a guy
who returned to his college coaching roots at Stanford before a
couple of losing seasons made him think that perhaps the NFL wasn't
so bad after all.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll says he won't be following Walsh back to the pros.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, it's out of my system," he said. "I was
there a long time and had a blast, tons of friends, great memories
and all that. But I don't care for doing that. I've already done
that. This is way different, and it's different in a good way,
because I'm really excited about it and having fun with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really pleased to be doing it. I don't see [the NFL] as the
ultimate.... I think this is way better. So, I'm in the right place."</TE>

<LD>Oscar De La Hoya has it all figured out. In about a month, he will
invite his old rival and new neighbor, Felix Trinidad, over for
dinner. It will be a short walk for Trinidad, from his gated
community in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to the next one over.</LD>
<LD>   Food and drinks will be served. There will be time to reminisce
about their historic match at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center
in 1999, the richest non-heavyweight match in boxing history.</LD>
<LD>   Trinidad, recently retired from boxing, may flash his boyish smile
and remind De La Hoya that it was Trinidad who won by a majority
decision. De La Hoya may talk about his regrets over running for the
last three rounds.</LD>
<TE>   Millie Corretjer, De La Hoya's Puerto Rican wife, will be there to
be sure nothing is lost in the conversation between her husband, a
Mexican American, and Trinidad, a native Puerto Rican.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between our Spanish and their Spanish is slang,"
De La Hoya says. "And they talk faster."</TE>
<TE>   And then, perhaps after dessert, it will be time to talk of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you doing, financially?" De La Hoya will ask him. "And
how will you be doing in 10 years? I see you have several homes and a
bunch of cars. You know, another $10-15 million would mean that you
would definitely be secure for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "You are 29. You will probably come back at some point. Why not
come back now? And if you do, why not fight me?"</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya outlined his plan Friday at a West Los Angeles hotel,
his eyes sparkling at the prospect of facing the man who handed him
his first defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to work my magic on him," De La Hoya said. "But I
don't want to rush it. He is still in the mentality that he is on
vacation. This is all new to him. He is still thinking like someone
who is retired. I want to leave it alone and wait for the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "By then, I am hoping he will be getting the itch. All these
fights are happening, [Marco Antonio] Barrera-[Johnny] Tapia last
week and [Erik] Morales-[Paulie] Ayala next week. I am hoping that
when he sees these fights, he'll start to feel that itch.... I think
he wants to fight. I think it's his father [manager-trainer Felix
Trinidad Sr.] who doesn't want him to come back."</TE>
<TE>   That could be a problem because Trinidad has always let his father
make his career decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Another obstacle to Trinidad-De La Hoya II would be weight. They
fought at 147 pounds the last time. De La Hoya is now a 154-pound
champion and Trinidad fought last year at 160. De La Hoya thinks he
and Trinidad could agree on a catch weight somewhere between 154 and
160.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear he's walking around at 195," De La Hoya said.</TE>
<TE>   On second thought, better forget dessert.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And If Not Trinidad?</TE>
<TE>   It has been generally assumed that if Trinidad does not return, De
La Hoya's next opponent will be Shane Mosley, the other man who has
beaten him.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily, says De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   He says he will give Trinidad until Jan. 1 to consider a rematch.
If the answer is still no, De La Hoya is considering fighting Winky
Wright in a bout that would give De La Hoya the opportunity to unify
the 154-pound division, or Vernon Forrest, who has twice beaten
Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya holds the World Boxing Assn. and World Boxing Council
154-pound titles. Wright is the International Boxing Federation
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I could make the most fighting Mosley," De La Hoya said.
"But I'm not looking at that. I'm looking at making history. Winky
says that if I could beat him, I would be an undisputed champion for
the first time and he's right."</TE>
<TE>   Is De La Hoya acting uninterested just to give himself leverage in
negotiations with Mosley? As much as he wants to avenge his defeat to
Trinidad, doesn't he also want to do the same with Mosley?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Also in His Future</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens with Trinidad, or Mosley or Wright or Forrest, De
La Hoya will be back in the ring in Los Angeles next year. Not to
fight, but to promote.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions will stage a fight show Jan. 16
at the Olympic Auditorium, where De La Hoya, his father and
grandfather all fought.</TE>
<TE>   It's one of 50 proposed shows next year for De La Hoya's
promotional company.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen of those will be televised on HBO with perhaps 15 others
televised as well.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya says he has been approached about staging one of his
shows at the sports complex being built in Carson by Philip Anschutz.</TE>

Giants without Dusty Baker as manager: "The biggest worry in the
Giants' immediate future is [Barry] Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   "He's signed for another four seasons, but that won't mean squat
if Bonds either doesn't want to play here or outgrows his usefulness.
If the Giants are forced to rebuild/retool, will Bonds have the
patience for this pardon-our-dust phase?</LD>
<LD>   "He tasted the World Series, he's zooming in on 40, what's to stop
him from 'requesting' a trade to a contender?</LD>

<HD>Betting to Shut Down Earlier</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Park and other Churchill Downs-owned tracks will
close wagering before horses enter gate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reacting to a public outcry that races other than this year's
Breeders' Cup pick six might have been bet after they had already
started, Hollywood Park and other Churchill Downs-owned tracks will
begin shutting off betting before the horses are loaded into the
starting gate.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Meeker, president of Churchill Downs Inc., said Friday that an
early lockup, of between 1 1/2 and two minutes, of all bets in the
parimutuel system would begin Wednesday at Hollywood Park, Churchill
Downs, Calder in Florida and Hoosier Park in Indiana. The new
company-wide policy will cost the tracks an undetermined amount of
mutuel handle at least in the beginning, because many bettors are
habitual procrastinators.</LD>
<LD>   Bettors also will not be able to make alternate bets if their
horses are scratched in the gate. They will get refunds, but because
of the early lockup, there will be no opportunity to hurriedly make
an extra wager.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm less concerned about the cost than [rebuilding] consumer
confidence," Meeker said. "We should do this, regardless of the cost.
This may turn out to be an adverse situation for some of the public,
but I think that, by and large, it will be received positively.
Horseplayers are very adaptable, and I think they will adapt to his
very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Arlington Park, another of the Churchill Downs tracks, ended its
season the day after last month's Breeders' Cup races, which were run
on a day when one bettor, a Baltimore man, had a ticket containing
all six winning payoffs on the pick six, each worth $428,352.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Derrick Davis has been unable to collect his payoff of
more than $3 million -- including consolation payoffs for five
winners -- because of an ongoing investigation that has resulted in
the dismissal of Chris Harn, an Autotote Corp. employee who had the
capability of tapping into the system and altering Davis' ticket
after the first four races were run. Harn and Davis were college
fraternity brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Meeker said bets would close as the first horse was being loaded
into the gate.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective is to get the final odds posted on all horses by
the time they leave the gate," he said. "I'm told that it takes 66
seconds to batch all the wagers from around the country on a race, so
we're going to allow enough time to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Last April at Hollywood, the odds on a winning horse dropped
dramatically, from 9-2 to 2-5, while the race was being run. The
explanation was that $118,000 in last-second bets, in large
denominations, had come in from a betting hub in Maine. Only $11,461
had been in the win pool on the horse before the big bet.</TE>
<TE>   Meeker also said Churchill Downs' tracks would no longer allow
their races to be bet via hubs that lack the capacity to record
off-track bets made by phone. Two New York off-track betting
companies, in Nassau County and the Catskill region, don't record
such bets. Davis used a Catskills phone account to place his bet on
the Breeders' Cup pick six. In California, the telephone betting law
requires bets be recorded and data stored for at least six months.</TE>
<TE>   In another reaction to the Breeders' Cup pick six, the new
Wagering Technology Working Group said that it is giving the
country's tote companies 21 days to begin installing software that
will scan all bets after each race of a multi-race wager.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Hit Pity Limits</HD>
<DH>A 106-92 loss in New Jersey is new low of sorts, leaving
them 1-4 and causing Scott to feel sorry for them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>They are battered and bruised, losers of four of their first five
games after a 106-92 defeat Friday against the New Jersey Nets, and
now this?</LD>
<LD>   Sympathy for the Clippers? From a former Clipper draftee?</LD>
<LD>   It was true.</LD>
<TE>   Net Coach Byron Scott, a 1983 first-round pick by the Clippers,
feels Coach Alvin Gentry's pain.</TE>
<TE>   "All these guys are playing for a contract, which makes it tough
on Alvin," Scott said, cutting to the crux of a situation that could
have easily been solved by management during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Clippers will be free agents at season's end. "[Eight] guys
who want to get paid what they're worth," Scott said. "That is one of
those things you worry about. How do you keep those guys playing
together? That would be tough to handle."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also has wondered aloud what a poor start would do to the
fragile state of mind of his youthful, skillful but anxious team.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it's here, now that the Clippers (1-4) are struggling to
win games, what can Gentry do but hope better days are ahead?</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that the Clippers might have lost to the Eastern
Conference champion Nets under the best of circumstances, as they did
twice last season. The Nets have won five of six to start the season
and clicked at everything they attempted in the second half against
the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, the Nets had point guard Jason Kidd playing at peak
efficiency. Kidd scored 35 points -- 27 in the second half, including
15 in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers trailed by only 83-82 four minutes into the fourth
quarter when Kidd and the Nets seized control. Richard Jefferson made
a jump shot. Kidd made a free throw, then a jump shot, then another,
then one more. Soon enough, the Nets were off and rolling on an 18-6
run that put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out a little flat," Kidd said. "We needed energy. I felt
that in the second half, I had to come out and push it. I felt if we
got some steals, some stops, then our defense would spark our
offense. We have to figure out a way to play hard for 48 minutes. We
can't rely on one guy going big."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Clippers must figure out a way to better handle the
ball. They committed 23 turnovers, which led to 29 points for New
Jersey. They had 23 turnovers that led to 28 Philadelphia points
during a 101-99 overtime loss to the 76ers on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "When you turn the ball over more than 20 times, you're not going
to beat a bad team, let alone a good one," Gentry said. "We're our
own worst enemy right now. Until we take care of the basketball we're
not going to win, especially on the road."</TE>
<TE>   A better grasp of the ball would have helped to slow Kidd, who
made 12 of 20 shots and all 11 free throws he attempted. He also had
seven rebounds, nine assists and three steals in 42 minutes. Kidd's
35-point game was his best since joining the Nets in a trade from the
Phoenix Suns on July 18, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did many things right Friday. Stopping Kidd was not
one of them. He rose to the challenge of facing Clipper point guard
Andre Miller, who scored 20 points on eight-for-17 shooting in 37
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the turnovers, the Clippers managed to capitalize on
energetic play to take a 56-47 lead after Keyon Dooling made two free
throws 24.3 seconds before halftime. They led, 66-58, after Miller
made a jumper and a free throw with 5:54 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   And they trailed, 83-82, before Kidd went to work and the
Clippers, in the words of Miller, "lost our composure and lost the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Elton Brand had 20 points and 11 rebounds and center
Michael Olowokandi had 18 points and 11 rebounds. But for some
reason, the Clippers tried to win down the stretch from the outside
instead of continuing to drop the ball down low to Brand and
Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   "We look good sometimes, then we look bad," Miller said, referring
to the Clippers' poor execution during a fourth quarter in which they
were outscored, 29-14. "We don't have room for error."</TE>

<HD>Maggette Is Playing Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette started for the fifth consecutive game at small
forward Friday against the New Jersey Nets. The Clippers have tried
to get him out of the lineup and into an operating room for
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette is determined to play as well as he can for as long as he
can despite having damaged cartilage.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what they're trying to do," Maggette said of the Clippers'
attempts to persuade him to have surgery. He added that he won't
agree to have the procedure, "Until I say so."</LD>
<TE>   Hurt when he landed awkwardly during the Clippers' Nov. 1 loss to
the Lakers, Maggette had an MRI exam Monday that revealed torn
lateral meniscus cartilage. It's the same injury for which power
forward Elton Brand had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept.
26.</TE>
<TE>   Brand sat out almost all of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's messed up," Maggette said before scoring 12 points in
32 minutes during the Clippers' 106-92 loss to the Nets. "I'll keep
playing until ... I decide I need [surgery].</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be stupid about it even though I'm the Bionic
Man," he added. "I'm trying to help my team win."</TE>
<TE>   Maggette acknowledged he probably would consider having surgery
now if small forward Lamar Odom were fit to play. Odom is on the
injured list because of a sprained right ankle and isn't expected
back until after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson scored six points in 13 minutes playing on a
hyperextended right knee. He also suffered a cut on his left eyelid
midway through the second quarter.... The Clippers and Channel 5
announced the station has dropped games Nov. 24 against Houston and
Dec. 1 against Indiana and replaced them with games Nov. 29 against
Sacramento and Dec. 21 against Denver.</TE>

<LD>California officials appeared Friday before an NCAA appeals committee
in Indianapolis in a bid to overturn the school's one-year bowl ban.</LD>
<LD>   The ban was issued in June after the program was cited for
violations involving academic fraud and extra benefits.</LD>
<LD>   A ruling on the appeal is expected within two weeks. California
(5-4), which plays at Arizona State (7-3) today, needs one victory to
become bowl eligible.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State, which fired Bobby Williams as coach on Monday, has
an interest in Washington Redskin defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis,
according to the Washington Post. Although the school has yet to form
a search committee and there has been no official contact between the
parties, sources told the paper that Lewis would be interested in the
job.... Michigan State changed the status of tailback and former
co-captain Dawan Moss from dismissed from the team to suspended
indefinitely. Although school officials did not explain the reason
for the change, it could clear the way for Moss to rejoin the
Spartans. Moss was arrested early Sunday morning for drunken driving
and fleeing and eluding police. He is scheduled to appear in court on
Wednesday.... Bucknell Coach Tom Gadd will not return from a leave of
absence he took before the season for cancer treatments.</TE>

<LD>Top-fuel dragsters, overshadowed somewhat by the John Force-Tony
Pedregon battle for National Hot Rod Assn. funny car supremacy, take
the spotlight today -- weather permitting -- at Pomona Raceway in the
18th annual Budweiser Shootout.</LD>
<LD>   Rain wiped out Friday's qualifying rounds for the $2-million Auto
Club NHRA Finals and the forecast is not encouraging for today's
program.</LD>
<LD>   Graham Light, NHRA vice president, said that Friday's schedule
would be canceled. Instead of four rounds of qualifying for Sunday's
final eliminations, the 16-car fields will be determined by three --
the one completed Thursday and two today.</LD>
<TE>   Track officials refused to speculate on what would happen if rain
continued, but two years ago, when rain wiped out the Budweiser
Shootout, it was postponed until the following February during the
Winternationals at Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   The Shootout, scheduled to start at 12:15 p.m., pits the eight
top-fuel drivers who accumulated the most qualifying points in the
23-event, $50-million Powerade series. The winner will receive
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the Budweiser Shootout at the final event gives us an
added incentive to finish the season on a high note and have bragging
rights in the off-season," said Kenny Bernstein, today's No. 1 seed
and a two-time winner of the bonus event.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, No. 1 qualifier at five events, will race Darrell
Russell, six-time winner Joe Amato's hand-picked successor when Amato
retired last year, in the first round. Russell had the quickest
top-fuel car in Thursday's first round, posting a 4.571-second
elapsed time.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting up a good number in our first time out will give us some
leeway in the Shootout," said Russell. "If we weren't solidly in the
show, we might be a little conservative, but now we can be more
aggressive with our setup. We can get closer to the ragged edge
without having to worry about making the field Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   If a driver wins both the Shootout and Sunday's finals, he will
receive a $50,000 bonus from the NHRA. Amato is the only double
winner. He did it in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Other first-round pairings: Larry Dixon, newly crowned NHRA
champion, vs. Doug Herbert; Scott Kalitta vs. Andrew Cowin of
Australia, the only Shootout rookie, and Tony Schumacher vs. Cory
McClenathan.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon and Bernstein have already won the $400,000 champion's purse
and $100,000 runner-up prize, respectively, but the payoffs for third
through sixth are up for grabs Only 92 points separate Schumacher,
with 1,397, from Russell, with 1,305. Between are Kalitta, 1,369, and
McClenathan, 1,310.</TE>

<HD>Ducks' Blue Line Special Paces Victory at Colorado</HD>
<DH>Anaheim defensemen Salei and Havelid score tying and
winning goals in a 3-2 overtime win over Avalanche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei never saw the puck go in that
tied the score.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Niclas Havelid caught sight of the puck only after the
game-winner was in the net in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   And 18,007 at the Pepsi Center and the Colorado Avalanche couldn't
believe their eyes.</LD>
<TE>   Duck defensemen drawing a blank on key goals hasn't exactly been a
rare occurrence in recent seasons. But this time it was different
because they were the ones scoring the goals in a come-from-behind
3-2 overtime victory Friday over the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Salei tied the score with a wrist shot from the blue line with 3
minutes 25 seconds left. Havelid then won it, carrying Joe Sakic on
his back to the net and chipping in a pass from Paul Kariya 20
seconds into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   That ended a six-game winless streak in the Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting a game like this here, in this building we should feel
real good," said goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who stopped 28 of 30
shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are now 3-1-1 in their last five games, including
victories over Boston and Colorado. They got this win without a goal
from Kariya, Steve Rucchin, Petr Sykora or the other usual suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "This proves we're a team," said Patric Kjellberg, who scored the
Ducks' first goal. "We're not just counting on Paul and Rooch to
finish it off. To be a successful team, we have come together and
play as a team depending on everybody to show up."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche was without goalie Patrick Roy and defenseman Rob
Blake, who are nursing injuries. The overtime loss meant a point, but
it also kept the Avalanche winless at home this season, a
franchise-record seven-game streak.</TE>
<TE>   There was little reason for the Ducks to expect to win this game.
They spent much of the first two periods killing penalties and were
fortunate to trail only 1-0 after the first period before Kjellberg
tied it with a power-play goal a minute into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Although Colorado didn't score on any of its six power plays, one
indirectly led to its second goal. That came after Giguere was called
for delay of game after knocking the net loose. "I got pushed into
the net," Giguere said. "[The referee] said I lifted my shoulder.
That doesn't change the fact I got pushed into it."</TE>
<TE>   As the penalty ended, Colorado's Radim Vrbata took advantage,
taking a pass from Martin Skoula and beating Giguere high for a 2-1
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Salei got the Ducks even late in the third. He knocked down the
puck at the blue line, then fired through a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that little hole there at the corner of the net," Salei
said, smirking. "I guess I got lucky.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to change the way everyone thinks of us. If we want
to be a good team, we've got to beat everybody in this league."</TE>

<HD>Little Interest in Pahlsson</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Chuck Fletcher, the Mighty Ducks' director of hockey operations, has
had contact with wayward center Samuel Pahlsson, but there seems
little chance of reconciliation. Pahlsson, apparently unhappy with
being sent to the minors, left the Cincinnati team Tuesday and
returned to Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks have been trying to trade Pahlsson, who played 80 games
with the team last season and 59 after being acquired from Boston in
2000-01. He did not figure prominently in the Ducks' plans this
season.</LD>
<LD>   "We had asked him to give us a little time," General Manager Bryan
Murray said. "I thought by now I would have been able to do
something. There just isn't any great interest in him. He's a good
player and I think he's an NHL player. He should give himself a
chance."</LD>
<TE>   Pahlsson's contract would pay him $550,000 if he played in the
NHL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Martin Gerber is expected to return from Switzerland and
rejoin the Ducks on Tuesday. He returned home to see his mother, who
has cancer.... Center Steve Rucchin had a seven-game point streak
ended.... Mike Brown, claimed on waivers from Vancouver on Oct. 11,
made his Duck debut Friday. He picked up two penalties in the second
period, for charging and fighting.</TE>

<HD>The Real Heat Is on Warmup Act</HD>
<DH>U.S. faces Canada in Women's Gold Cup final, but Mexico,
Costa Rica have more at stake in third-place game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the United States and Canada, both of whom already have qualified
for the Women's World Cup in China next year, all that is at stake
tonight at the Rose Bowl is the championship of the CONCACAF Women's
Gold Cup.</LD>
<LD>   That means regional soccer bragging rights, but not a lot more.</LD>
<LD>   For Costa Rica and Mexico, on the other hand, the third-place game
at 4:30 that precedes the 7 p.m. final means everything.</LD>
<TE>   The winner can still reach the World Cup via a home-and-home
playoff against a yet-to-be-determined Asian team. The loser goes
away with nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Much will depend on which coach, Mexico's Leonardo Cuellar or
Costa Rica's Ricardo Rodriguez, has best been able to raise his
players' spirits in the wake of bitter semifinal defeats on Wednesday
in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach April Heinrichs and Canada Coach Even Pellerud have no
such problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be one of those finals where it's wide open because both
teams have qualified for the World Cup, which would be great,"
Heinrichs said. "It's a style that we like to play every time we step
out on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll go after it and try to play attacking and creative soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams feature some of the finest goal scorers in women's
soccer. Canada's lineup includes Christine Sinclair, with a
tournament-high seven goals; Charmaine Hooper with six and Kara Lang
with four.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. counters with Tiffeny Milbrett, who has six goals; Cindy
Parlow, who has five, and Shannon MacMillan, who has four.</TE>
<TE>   If it continues to rain, it could be the goalkeepers -- Briana
Scurry for the U.S. and Karina LeBlanc for Canada -- who play the
crucial roles, trying to control a wet ball on a slippery surface.</TE>
<TE>   Even rain will be preferable for Costa Rica to the weather the
Central Americans faced in Victoria, Canada, during the first round.
It was so cold that Haiti's coach, Gerard Cineus, cleverly dubbed it
"the Group of Freezing to Death."</TE>
<TE>   Pellerud, who coached Norway to the 1995 Women's World Cup title
before taking charge of Canada, is accustomed to both cold and rain.
He has had considerable success of late against the reigning world
champions, no matter the weather.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is 23-3-2 against Canada, but only 1-2-2 in the last five
matches between the countries. The Americans have a 15-game unbeaten
streak in U.S. venues, their last loss coming two years ago, a 3-1
setback at Columbus, Ohio against the Canadians</TE>
<TE>   "Canada is very athletic, very strong and very powerful,"
Heinrichs said. "They play a high-percentage defensive game, where
they will sit back with numbers behind the ball and counter with two
world-class goal scorers in Hooper and Sinclair, and you might even
add a third, Lang, who is a world-class forward on the under-19
level."</TE>
<TE>   Pellerud, a tactically astute coach who is rapidly turning Canada
into one the world's elite teams with the goal of hosting and winning
the World Cup in 2007, is not afraid to criticize his own team.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's semifinal, he said his players had
"underachieved" in beating Mexico, 2-0, on the strength of two own
goals.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked hesitant, they looked nervous, they were not able to
play the high-quality defensive pressure we used to; they were not
able to create the goal chances we used to; they were not precise,
hesitant, slow," he said. "I think that was due to the importance of
[winning] the game."</TE>
<TE>   With less at stake tonight, Canada is likely to revert to form and
give the U.S. all it can handle.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rodriguez, whose Costa Rica team lost to both Canada and
the U.S., likes the Americans' chances.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very complete team," he said. "They can attack in a
variety of ways, down the middle, from the wings, on the ground, in
the air, with power and with passing. I don't see any weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   As Panama's coach, Roberto Sala, said after his team was trounced
by the U.S. earlier in the tournament:</TE>
<TE>   "They are not the world champions for nothing."</TE>

<TE>   A Threat From the North</TE>
<TE>   Although Canada has beaten the United States only three times in
28 women's soccer matches, Charmaine Hooper has been a constant thorn
in the side of the U.S. Her nine goals in full internationals are the
most scored by any player against the U.S. women:</TE>

<HD>Carson Wins It by Myles, 43-26</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As defenders and his offensive linemen skidded and flopped around
him, Carson High running back Brandon Myles didn't seem to have any
problem with the wet Gardena High field. Myles was simply too fast to
slip and fall.</LD>
<LD>   The senior broke open a tight Marine League game Friday night with
an electrifying second-half performance and finished with a
career-high 256 yards and three touchdowns to give the Colts a
rain-soaked 43-26 victory and a share of the Marine League
championship.</LD>
<LD>   Carson (7-2, 4-0) can clinch the title outright with a victory
next week over Wilmington Banning.</LD>
<TE>   Gardena (6-3, 3-1) saw its three-game winning streak end.</TE>
<TE>   Myles helped charge the Colt running game with his breakaway
speed. He opened the third quarter with a 40-yard run on the way to
216 yards in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, was Brandon amazing tonight," Carson Coach John Aguirre
said. "Everybody looks at [defensive lineman] Matthew Malele as our
most valuable player, but I'd cast my vote for Brandon right now."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Johnson busted loose on the Colts' next play for a
43-yard touchdown run and a 20-13 lead. Carson needed only one play
on its next possession as Myles outran Gardena for a 56-yard scoring
run to push the Colts' lead to 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Myles, who carried just 13 times, finished with a 70-yard
touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to cap the scoring. His
previous highest rushing total was a 233-yard effort this season
against Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to run with small steps," he said. "The offensive line
just made it too easy for me."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson added 110 yards in eight carries. Carson gained all of its
473 yards on the ground, 337 of it after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting better each week," Aguirre said. "We had a lot of
penalties and we need to work on that. If we keep our composure,
we'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Gardena, looking to win its first Marine League title in 28 years,
rallied from a 6-0 deficit with a 40-yard touchdown run by fullback
Jason Franklin and a three-yard scoring run by DeAndre Hughes. Carson
cut the lead to 13-12 when Kevin McCall scored on a three-yard run
late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Dorsey 21, L.A. Fremont 12 -- Sophomore Jeremiah Johnson
rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown in 17 carries in his second
varsity start to lead the Dons, who scored 15 unanswered points in
the third quarter, to a Coliseum League upset over visiting Fremont.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest win of the season for us," Johnson said of
beating The Times' No. 12-ranked team. "Coach [Paul Knox] said we had
to lay it on the line to save the season, and we did that."</TE>
<TE>   Fremont (7-2, 2-2) scored first when Mark Bradford returned a punt
70 yards for a touchdown, but missed the extra-point try. The Dons
(4-5, 3-1) tied it a minute into the second quarter on Johnson's
24-yard scoring run, but missed the conversion kick.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont led, 12-6, at halftime after a six-yard run by Melvon
James with 10:43 left in the second quarter and a failed two-point
conversion. James finished with 70 yards in seven carries.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, which hosts Crenshaw (6-3, 4-0) next Friday, scored in the
third quarter on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Donald Prince to
Jerome Johnson and on an 18-yard run by Jody Rucks, who finished with
58 yards in 10 carries.</TE>

<HD>Casillas' Kick Saves the Day for Pomona</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Freshman Noe Casillas had never played football before this season,
but he lined up for his first field goal attempt Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   In the rain. On homecoming. With the game on the line and a league
title at stake.</LD>
<LD>   Casillas barely made a 25-yarder with 2:21 remaining, but it gave
Pomona a 17-14 Valle Vista League victory over Covina Northview. The
Red Devils clinched a tie for their first league title since 1990
when they were in the Montview League.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a lot of pressure," said Casillas, a soccer player who
only kicks for the football team. "I thought I was going to slip."</TE>
<TE>   Of his game-winner, he said, "It's better than kicking a goal in
soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Pomona (8-1, 4-0), which is ninth in the Southern Section Division
IX poll, scored first on Mike Worrell's three-yard touchdown run in
the first quarter and led, 14-7, on Paul Thomas' seven-yard run in
the third. Thomas gained 77 yards in 25 carries and Worrell had 93
yards in 15.</TE>
<TE>   Northview (7-2, 3-1), second in the division poll, outgained
Pomona, 200 yards to 165.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings tied the score, 14-14, early in the fourth quarter
with the game's only pass completion, a 43-yarder from Danny Bonilla
to Remington Hawkins. They had tied the score, 7-7, on Sean Houston's
seven-yard run.</TE>

<HD>Braves Rally to Beat Servite</HD>
<DH>St. John Bosco turns late turnovers into 24-20 victory,
setting up Serra League title showdown with Mater Dei.</DH>

<LD>The improbable season for Bellflower St. John Bosco became even more
unbelievable Friday night when the Braves scored 15 points in the
final 5 minutes 30 seconds and defeated Anaheim Servite, 24-20, in a
Serra League game at St. John Bosco.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves (7-2, 4-0 in league play), often the forgotten team in
a league with Los Angeles Loyola, Santa Ana Mater Dei, Santa
Margarita and La Puente Bishop Amat, are now only one victory away
from winning their first league title since 1986.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves play at Santa Ana Stadium next Thursday against Mater
Dei. Should the Monarchs defeat Santa Margarita tonight, both teams
will be unbeaten in league play entering that game.</LD>
<TE>   "Every win for us is big," Coach Kiki Mendoza said. "When we beat
Loyola, we said, 'Wow, that's big.' When we beat Santa Margarita,
that was big. Now we've got the biggest game of all next week."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't seem likely midway through the fourth quarter. Servite
(7-2, 2-2) held a 20-9 lead after quarterback Ryan Coffelt plunged in
from one yard with 8:46 left.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco then drove to the Servite 10-yard line but fumbled
with 5:37 left.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't cuss much, but when that happened I did," Mendoza said.
"But then I regrouped and I told the defense to get the ball back and
we'll win the game."</TE>
<TE>   They did, and they did.</TE>
<TE>   One play after the fumble, defensive back Derrick Williams
stripped Servite's Dillon Bedard and Joe Cowan scooped it up and ran
15 yards for a touchdown. A two-point conversion run by quarterback
Joseph Souza pulled St. John Bosco to within 20-17 with 5:30 left.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Servite fumbled again and Cameron Fortner jumped
on the ball to give St. John Bosco possession at the Friar 18. Five
plays later, Albert Butler bulldozed in from five yards to give St.
John Bosco a 24-20 lead with 2:51 left.</TE>
<TE>   Servite drove to the Braves' 35, but a fourth-down pass by Coffelt
fell incomplete with 1:19 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all we think about around here," Cowan said about the
league title. "It's never been done in [the Serra League] by this
team."</TE>
<TE>   Servite, meanwhile, is now scrambling to make the playoffs after
looking like the league favorite when it opened the season 7-0. The
Friars, who lost last week to Mater Dei, 24-7, must now defeat Loyola
next week to claim third place and an automatic playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were in good position at the end," Servite Coach
Larry Toner said. "There's no reason to think that we're going to
fumble twice in three plays."</TE>
<TE>   Butler rushed eight times for 53 yards and two touchdowns and
Williams had 79 yards in 12 carries for the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rubalcaba rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries
for Servite, which outgained St. John Bosco, 329-257.</TE>

<LD>Neither rain nor mud could slow down Michael Bumpus of Culver City
High on Friday night, and that's why the Centaurs are one victory
away from a perfect regular-season record.</LD>
<LD>   Bumpus caught two touchdown passes and had an interception to help
visiting Culver City (9-0, 4-0 in league) clinch at least a share of
the Pioneer League championship with a 26-13 victory over previously
unbeaten El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Running back Armon De'Launey was another fast Culver City player
unaffected by the wet playing conditions. He rushed for 173 yards in
16 carries and scored touchdowns on runs of 64 and 40 yards.</LD>
<TE>   The Centaurs, No. 3 in the Southern Section's Division X poll,
have come a long way since Coach Tom Salter inherited a 1-9 team four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Salter, who coached La Puente Bishop Amat to a Division I title in
1995, played 13 sophomores on a 3-6 team last season. Bumpus and
De'Launey were two of those players and have matured into junior
standouts.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City was able to disrupt El Segundo (8-1, 3-1), No. 2 in
Division X, by pressuring quarterback Matt Engle, who came in
completing 72% of his passes and having been intercepted only twice.</TE>
<TE>   Engle was sacked three times, had three passes intercepted and
finished 14 of 40 for 160 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Engle's 25-yard touchdown pass to Brad Franks with 8:08 left
pulled the Eagles to within 20-13. But De'Launey broke off his
40-yard touchdown run to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt just as fast, just as quick," said Bumpus, who caught
touchdown passes of five and eight yards from quarterback Alex Cueva.</TE>
<TE>   Said Salter: "Michael is a special player."</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>

<TE>   La Verne Bonita 14, Covina Charter Oak 7 -- The Bearcats (5-3,
3-0) scored an upset victory over the No. 17 Chargers (7-2, 2-1),
defending Division VII champions, in a Miramonte League game at
Bonita.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Musa's 67-yard interception return in the second quarter and
a blocked punt by Cody Maldanado in the third quarter accounted for
Bonita's points. Charter Oak, ranked No. 2 in Division VI, had the
ball deep in Bearcat territory twice in the fourth quarter only to be
stopped by a costly turnover in the end zone and a stellar Bearcat
defense.</TE>
<TE>   -- Josh Horwitz</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia 47, Pasadena 6 -- Senior tailback Michael Howe rushed for
175 yards and a touchdown in 22 carries as the Apaches clinched at
least a share of the Pacific League title with a victory at Pasadena
City College.</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia (9-0, 4-0), No. 3 in Division III, also got a strong
performance from quarterback Brian Ziska, who completed only four of
seven passes for 75 yards, but had touchdowns of 35 and 25 yards to
Michael Flath and Richard Wright, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Ziska also ran for a one yard score that gave the Apaches a 41-6
lead with 1:11 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Flath also had an 82-yard kickoff return for Arcadia's first
touchdown, immediately after R.J. McNeil had given Pasadena a 6-0
lead on a 66-yard touchdown run with 2:04 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Things went downhill for the Bulldogs (4-3-2, 3-1), who lost
starting tailback Lamon Branner to a sprained right ankle with 3:50
left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then with 3:15 left in the third quarter, linebacker Michael Frye
was ejected for fighting and will have to sit out Pasadena's last
regular-season game against Pasadena Muir.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>

<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure 24, Santa Barbara San Marcos 0 -- Whitney
Lewis rushed for 158 yards and two touchdowns in 30 carries for the
No. 12 Seraphs in a rain-soaked Channel League game at Ventura High.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was penciled in to start the game at wide receiver, but St.
Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack switched him to tailback after St.
Bonaventure (8-1, 4-0) had a difficult time passing the ball during
pregame warmups.</TE>
<TE>   The Seraphs led, 16-0, at halftime, and put the game away with
2:45 left in the third quarter when Lewis scored on a 25-yard run. He
also ran for three two-point conversions.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure, the section's top-ranked Division IV team, scored
its first touchdown on an 83-yard pass from quarterback Brian Stevens
to wide receiver Nick Pierson with 1:41 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Seraphs' second touchdown was a three-yard run by Lewis with
4:54 left in the first half to cap a 10-play, 65-yard drive. Stevens
completed two of three passes for 95 yards.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos (6-3, 2-2), No. 9 in Division IV, was held to 119
yards.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Downey 27, Compton Dominguez 26 -- Michael Higgins rushed for 127
yards and two touchdowns, and the Vikings made a 27-point outburst in
the second quarter stand up in a San Gabriel Valley League game at
Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Downey (5-3, 3-0) scored three touchdowns in the final 4:28 of the
first half and clinched at least a share of its second league title
in three seasons. Downey plays at Lynwood next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Darryll Crummie rushed for 97 yards and Willie Crummie rushed for
89, but Dominguez (5-4, 2-1) was hurt by four lost fumbles, including
three fumbles on hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Franks had three catches for 128 yards and scored on a
23-yard run with one minute left in the first half to put Downey
ahead, 27-17.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa 36, Santa Ana 7 -- The host Mustangs (7-2, 5-0)
clinched a share of the Golden West League title behind the running
of senior Keola Asuega, who had 266 yards and three touchdowns in 19
carries at Orange Coast College.</TE>
<TE>   Asuega scored on runs of 25, 74 and 67 yards. His 74-yard run came
on the first play from scrimmage in the second half and put the
Mustangs ahead, 15-0.</TE>
<TE>   Asuega has 1,633 yards and 17 touchdowns this season for Costa
Mesa, No. 8 in Division VII.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended a seven-game winning streak for Santa Ana (7-2,
4-1), which played without quarterback Omar Carrasco, who broke his
foot last week.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Kresal</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Northwood 21, Corona del Mar 0 -- In a game featuring 12
fumbles, Jeff Keller carried 35 times without a turnover in the rain
and mud at Newport Harbor to lead the Timberwolves (8-1, 4-0) to at
least a share of their second consecutive Pacific Coast League title.</TE>
<TE>   Keller, who rushed for 210 yards, opened the scoring with a
47-yard run late in the first quarter. Northwood quarterback Kyle
Harper threw a 29-yard scoring pass to Brendan Egan in the third
quarter to make it 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   Harper, who completed three of seven passes for 47 yards, scored
on a one-yard run early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar quarterback Jonathon Hubbard completed three of 14
passes for 95 yards with one interception, and teammate Mark
Cianciulli carried 12 times for 45 yards. The Sea Kings fell to 5-4,
3-1.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mark Alai</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine 24, Santa Ana Foothill 17 -- Despite 268 yards rushing, 81
yards receiving and two touchdowns by Mike Liti, Foothill, the No. 1
team in Division VI, was upset in a Sea View League game at Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill (7-2, 3-1) is tied with Irvine and Newport Harbor atop
the league standings and finishes by hosting the Sailors on Thursday
at Tustin. Irvine hosts Laguna Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (6-3, 3-1) took advantage of five Foothill turnovers. Don
Poole completed 13 of 21 passes for 148 yards and Quincy Lever caught
six passes for 56 yards.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Without question, Habibti was one of the best 2-year-old fillies in
the country in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of Tabasco Cat won three of her four races last year,
capping her campaign with a head victory over You in a memorable
Hollywood Starlet almost 11 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Things haven't been quite the same in 2002 for Habibti. She is
winless in four races and will try to end her losing streak in
today's $200,000 Churchill Downs Distaff Handicap at one mile.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by the Thoroughbred Corp. and trained by Bob Baffert,
Habibti will be making her second appearance at Churchill Downs. She
was third behind Farda Amiga and Take Charge Lady in the Kentucky
Oaks and, in her only race since then, was fifth at 3-5 in the Torrey
Pines at Del Mar on Sept. 8. Robby Albarado has the call.</TE>
<TE>   The main event at Hollywood Park is the $125,000 Matiara, an
ungraded stakes for 3-year-old fillies. The race was moved from the
turf to the dirt because of wet weather and one of the scratches was
certain favorite Megahertz.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park is a 5 1/2-furlong
race for 3-year-olds and up and is the last leg of the Churchill
Downs Simulcast Network pick three. The other two races are Calder's
11th and Churchill Downs' 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Favorites at Hollywood Park. The betting choice won all
eight races at the Inglewood track on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Greta Kuntzweiler and Dean Butler. The two jockeys
began the Churchill Downs meet a combined two for 45.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Pocketfullofpesos, Sweet
Rhapsody and Margeds Dream in the fourth, Our New Recruit and Jersey
Rebel in the fifth and singling Royal Footage in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 3/4. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $14.80/$18.40. Total money bet: $32.</TE>

<LD>Jamie Storr had been penciled in to start for the Kings Friday, but
as Coach Andy Murray has often shown with his backup goaltender,
pencils have erasers. Felix Potvin made his 11th start in 14 games.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt that Felix needed to play tonight," Murray said before
the game. "Sometimes you use your feel as a coaching staff [as to]
what the situation dictates. Felix is our No. 1 guy and we're trying
to get a win here tonight to get the feeling going again, so we're
going with him."</LD>
<LD>   Left unsaid was that Storr has struggled. He hadn't lost a start
since last November, a 7-0-1 streak, before a 5-1 loss to the
Columbus Blue Jackets on Oct. 27.</LD>
<TE>   Monday, he gave up three goals in a 5-2 loss to the Minnesota
Wild.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mikko Eloranta is listed as week to week after suffering a
sprained left knee Tuesday night against the San Jose Sharks, but the
Kings fear he could be sidelined for as long as six weeks. He was put
on injured reserve to make room on the roster for defenseman Aaron
Miller. With Miller back in the lineup, Brad Norton and Andreas Lilja
were scratched.... Ken Belanger, who suffered a concussion against
the Sharks, was unavailable to play Friday.</TE>

<DH>Smolinski's fluttering shot beats Lalime for 3-2 victory
over Senators. Cammalleri has assist in debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA</DL>
<LD>Bryan Smolinski knew he was bucking the odds.</LD>
<LD>   When he fired a 35-foot wrist shot toward the net in the third
period Friday night, he did so with the knowledge that very few NHL
goals are scored on such attempts without the puck being deflected or
the goaltender screened.</LD>
<LD>   So Smolinski was as surprised as anyone when his fluttering shot
cleanly beat Patrick Lalime with 14:33 to play, giving the Kings a
3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators in front of 16,926 at the Corel
Centre.</LD>
<TE>   "It was kind of a knuckler, kind of surprised him a little bit,"
Smolinski said. "I wanted to let a harder shot go, but [the puck]
just kind of rolled in front of me a little bit. I saw the defender's
stick coming to try to poke check it and I just kind of shot it at
the net, just got rid of it real quick.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just lucky that it kind of dipped on him. I saw him go
down for a hard shot -- he was ready for it -- but he kind of got
caught in no man's land."</TE>
<TE>   Lalime blamed poor footwork.</TE>
<TE>   The shot, which sailed over the goaltender's right shoulder and
into the upper left corner of the net, ended a two-game losing streak
for the Kings, who got major contributions from the two new faces in
their lineup, veteran defenseman Aaron Miller and 20-year-old rookie
center Michael Cammalleri.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who sat out training camp and the season's first 13 games
after abdominal surgery, played a game-high 24 minutes 37 seconds in
his season debut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my first game in six months, so it was a little bit of a
struggle just handling the puck and getting into the game," he said,
"but it went better than I expected."</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri, making his NHL debut after his recall Thursday from
the minors, played on the top line with Adam Deadmarsh and Ziggy
Palffy and registered his first NHL point, assisting on a
second-period goal by Mathieu Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   To the delight of his parents, Leo and Ruth, who drove up from
Toronto, Cammalleri helped the Kings erase a one-goal deficit for the
second time, feeding a pass in front to the streaking Schneider for a
power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream come true," said Cammalleri, an All-American at
Michigan who gave up his senior season of eligibility to sign with
the Kings. "I grew up in Toronto, dreamed of playing in the National
Hockey League my whole life and worked real hard to get an
opportunity. It was a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Continuing an eight-game trip with the first of five consecutive
games against Canadian teams, the Kings spotted the Senators a 1-0
lead on a first-period power-play goal by Wade Redden.</TE>
<TE>   They pulled even on a second-period goal by Erik Rasmussen, his
first with the Kings since the trade that brought him from the
Buffalo Sabres last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Another power-play goal, this one by Radek Bonk at 8:33 of the
second period, gave the Senators the lead again, but Schneider's goal
tied the score. Cammalleri took a pass from Palffy behind the net,
carried it to the other side and slid a pass to Schneider, who lifted
a shot over Lalime from just outside the crease.</TE>
<TE>   "Schneids made a great play to get open and I just gave it to
him," Cammalleri said. "He seems to find the net whenever he gets it
in that spot."</TE>
<TE>   Another rookie, Alexander Frolov, assisted on the winner, slipping
a pass ahead to Smolinski, who sped alone into the attacking zone
before unleashing what he called a "Phil Niekro" knuckleball from the
right point.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Felix Potvin took it from there, making 10 of his 28
saves in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice when you hear the buzzer at the end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Potvin, maybe, but not for Lalime.</TE>

<HD>47 Shots? That's Rare Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bemused in Boston after Kobe Bryant had jacked 47 shots in a loss to
the Celtics on Thursday night, Phil Jackson had said he'd never seen
such a thing, which goes to show how forgettable another man's arm
weariness can be.</LD>
<LD>   Not quite 10 years ago, Michael Jordan shot 49 times in an
overtime loss to the Orlando Magic, and the man on the sideline
egging him on could only have been Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant's 47 shots did not touch the Laker record, 55. But Elgin
Baylor required three overtimes on Dec. 8, 1961, in a 151-147 victory
over Philadelphia. Bryant needed one overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Only five players in NBA history have taken more than 47 shots in
a game -- Wilt Chamberlain 22 times, Baylor and Rick Barry twice
each, Jordan and George Gervin once apiece. Chamberlain's record is
63, on March 2, 1962, the night in Hershey, Pa., he scored 100 points
against the New York Knicks. Forty-seven had been reached 10 other
times, most recently by Sacramento King Chris Webber in an overtime
game almost two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A sampling of the most attempts by the game's greatest players
showed what an unusual night Bryant had. Bill Russell's high was 28.
Jerry West took 40. Allen Iverson's high is 42. Karl Malone has never
taken more than 34. And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the greatest scorer in
history, once took 39 shots, and never more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson joked that Bryant had three ice bags strapped to his body
in the aftermath of Thursday's game, one on each knee and the third
on his shooting elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's nothing," he said. "You guys forget, I was a scorer when I
came into the league."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox watched Thursday's game in Boston from a barstool, amid
Celtic fans who rode him, but not too hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are a little more cautious now," he said, smiling,
"knowing I'll run you down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult part of his six-game suspension, Fox said,
would be found in the statistics and in the training room.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, who has twisted both ankles, his left one again
Thursday night, has averaged 35.2 minutes. Robert Horry, who has a
swollen right hand and a sore heel, has averaged 35.5.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, the Lakers played the last of five games in eight
nights in four cities. They play twice in the next eight days, both
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert and Devean keep looking at me," Fox said. "But I know
they'll forgive me."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Lose 'House Keys</HD>
<DH>L.A. is swept on three-game trip as Wizards' Stackhouse
scores on uncontested dunk at the buzzer for 100-99 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was not an uninteresting three-game trip, simply a winless one.</LD>
<LD>   At the very end of it, the Lakers stood on a floor that shook
beneath them, Jerry Stackhouse having just flown past for a winning
dunk, a town starved for decent basketball stomping deliriously
around them.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Wizards defeated the Lakers, 100-99, Friday night
at MCI Center, and while the victors dashed off the floor in each
other's arms, the Lakers were still awaiting the return of Shaquille
O'Neal, a grim 2-5 in the meantime.</LD>
<TE>   They hadn't started as poorly in 12 years, and they hadn't had an
0-3 trip in seven. Blown out in Cleveland and beaten in overtime in
Boston, the Lakers took their only lead against the Wizards with 2.9
seconds left, on a signature three-point basket from the left corner
by a gimpy Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Back from a 17-point deficit for the second time in two nights,
the Lakers flew from the floor, pounded each other's chests and then
peered at the clock. Two-point-nine seconds remained.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Oh, no,' " Horry said. "A lot can happen in three
seconds."</TE>
<TE>   He paused.</TE>
<TE>   "And a lot happened."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of three road games in four nights, of five games in
eight, , of too many minutes and too many air miles and not enough
familiar faces, the Lakers had neither the strength nor the fortitude
to stop the final play, to defend a 99-98 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, who had scaled back from 47 shots in Boston to 21
here and scored 27 points, followed Michael Jordan across the floor.
Jordan, who scored a season-high 25 points, took him there purposely.</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who limped around on a sore left heel and sore right foot,
defended Bryon Russell, but did not front him, as Coach Phil Jackson
instructed, shrilly. Russell took the inbounds pass from Stackhouse,
who entered the floor near the Laker bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I should have switched," Horry said.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, on two achy ankles, had been told to stay with
Stackhouse, who already had 27 points and was en route to 29.</TE>
<TE>   "He cut right, I kept up with him," George said. "He cut left, I
didn't have enough to push off. He went by me."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he should have been in the game, then, George shrugged.
"I had to. Everybody fouled out."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Rick Fox, who returned from his six-game suspension
and played well with 10 points, though the secondary scoring had been
carried by Brian Shaw, who scored 20 points in 20 minutes, 16 of the
points in the fourth quarter, when he made four of six
three-pointers. Fox, a sage defender, fouled out with 23.9 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   That put George on Stackhouse, the crowd frantic, the game on the
line, one short defensive stand between a horrible trip and a
palatable one. After a lob inbounds pass to Russell, Stackhouse took
the ball back about 15 feet from the basket and charged uncontested
to the rim. No Laker met him there.</TE>
<TE>   When the horn sounded, four Lakers stared at George, the
fourth-year player who'd become a starter in Fox's absence, and
started again against the Wizards while Fox found his legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could do it," George said. "I thought I had enough to
get it done. Rob, he's banged up, too. So when I see [Stackhouse]
going toward Rob, I'm like, 'Oh my God.' "</TE>
<TE>   And then Bryant and others put their hands on their hips.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I saw that too," George said. "It is my fault. Tough
situation, though."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant would have none of it. It had been a curious game for him,
isolated as he was several times against Jordan. The crowd roared
when Jordan got the ball on the wing with Bryant on his hip, and
cheered wildly when his fade-away jumper was true. Averaging 13.2
points in five games, all of them as a reserve, Jordan made nine of
14 field-goal attempts. That is why Bryant followed Jordan, why he
made it clear it was every man for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to stay between your man and the basket at that
crucial point in time in the game," Bryant said, seething. "You can't
let your man back-cut you to the basket and get a layup to win the
game. That's just basic basketball. That shouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why none of George's teammates reacted to meet Stackhouse at
the rim, Bryant's eyes narrowed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to stay between his man and the ball. Period."</TE>
<TE>   Told George suggested he was physically unable to stay with
Stackhouse, Bryant snapped, "He didn't say that. I'm not going to say
nothing to that. I'll deal with him in practice."</TE>

<LD>In reply to Jean Amundson's concern [Viewpoint, Nov. 2] over whether
or not the "proper" example was conveyed by Tyler Ebell and his eight
teammates when they took "free" mints from a restaurant located on
the pier in Ventura, you missed the point. If you were from the area,
not Ridgecrest, you would probably have more to work with. No free
mints here. At my cost, Tyler took his five offensive linemen, tight
end and two fullbacks to an all-you-can-eat dinner at that fine pier
restaurant. The cost: $650 to me, priceless for them. Also, breakfast
burritos every Saturday morning at the mandatory film session.</LD>
<LD>   Take it from someone who knows best, they earned every bit of it,
the CIF championship and the free mints. As for the pier restaurant,
they loved it!</LD>

<LD>I travel a fair amount and as a result must have missed the
announcement that the Saturday Viewpoint is now devoted to the inane
letter of the week. The letters last Saturday could have only been
due to this new contest. For example:</LD>
<LD>   1. The writer in Stevenson Ranch says that 85% of Angel fans are
Dodger fans -- this must be the same reason that even the San
Fernando Valley wants to leave L.A. One would think that the class
the Angels possess wouldn't play well in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   2. Anaheim drove the Rams out of Southern California. Is this
after L.A. drove them out of L.A., Georgia traded for a washed-up
quarterback because he looked good in the uniform, and the letter
writer didn't leave his couch for the 80-minute drive to watch them
finish .500?</LD>
<TE>   3. The Giant fan who "feared for his life" as he left Edison Field
was probably more concerned about the 10 beers that he drank, and
that finding his way to State College, then Katella, and then the
freeway was way too confusing. Nice fiction from a person whose team
just lost.</TE>
<TE>   4. The Trojan fan living in Oregon bothered by the "sham dynasty"
of Oregon and Oregon State football and feels vindicated by USC
beating Oregon is confusing his bias with wins and losses. I suppose
that going 11-1 as Oregon did last year is a sham when USC should
have won so many more games just because it used to.</TE>
<TE>   5. The Laker goons are attacking the Sacramento skilled players.
Would these be the highly talented Scot Pollard, Vlade Divac and Doug
Christie?</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rennie</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita</TE>

<LD>Kansas State 64, Kansas 0. Coach Bill Snyder of Kansas State, who has
a history of scheduling unrated and overmatched teams -- Western
Kentucky, Louisiana Monroe, Eastern Illinois -- and beating them as
badly as he can, epitomizes college football today. Gone is the very
nature of athletics and good sportsmanship, which has succumbed to
the polls and the BCS. It's so unfortunate, but it seems to be
working.</LD>

<TE>   After three of the top college teams lose to lesser opponents, and
Miami needs four quarters to beat Rutgers (Rutgers!) while Ohio State
handily dispatches Minnesota, your paper calls the Buckeyes
"overrated." This is the same Buckeye team that is undefeated, hasn't
given up a point in the second half of the last four games and, in
case you forgot, pasted Washington State, the top team in the Pac-10,
in September.</TE>
<TE>   Can they finish? Time will tell, but at this point Ohio State has
done everything necessary to have earned the right to be where it's
at.</TE>
<TE>   Buckeyes overrated? You guys are overrated. Does the Enquirer have
a sports section?</TE>

<LD>T.J. Simers' Nov. 7 article on the WTA Championships left me with a
bitter taste in my mouth. The headline, along with the picture of
Justine Henin, gave such a negative first impression that I (an avid
tennis player) almost didn't read it.</LD>
<LD>   The headline blasted the entire event; in essence saying that it
wasn't worth anyone's time. If I were associated with the WTA, I
would demand a retraction.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Mr. Simers shouldn't have talked to any tennis players, or
bothered to show up, out of respect to the players, the tournament
and the readers of the L.A. Times.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe I missed it, but was there a point to his rude article?</TE>

Kobe want to be the Man? Did Kobe inherit his father's selfishness?
Does Kobe really want to run the triangle?</TE>

<TE>   Tim Salmon has had arthroscopic surgery to remove damaged
cartilage from his left knee just days after the World Series.
Meanwhile, Shaq is still sitting out of Laker games because he
scheduled his surgery for the end of his off-season rather than the
beginning. It's obvious who has respect for his fans, his team and
his profession and who does not.</TE>

games. Magic bumped an official and received a suspension only a few
weeks after harshly criticizing Nick Van Exel for bumping an

player who was an integral part of (at least) three championship

<LD>This edition of the Kings' hockey team is a disgrace. Praise is
constantly heaped on General Manager Dave Taylor, but the coach is
stuck with five or six reasonably skilled players and a bunch of
hustling unskilled individuals with no scoring ability. Right now
only Ziggy Palffy can be considered skillful. During the off-season,
Taylor and the Kings' management did nothing to make this team a
genuine contender.</LD>

take some of your own advice. Next time you go out of town, take it
one step further and don't come back at all, because you can't

<TE>   In last Saturday's Letters, reader Rick Farmiloe, a self-described
"heartbroken Giant fan," surmised that 85% of Angel fans are
disaffected Dodger fans who merely took a short ride on the Halos'
World Series bandwagon. While I am very interested to know what
scientific data Mr. Farmiloe collected to arrive at his conclusion, I
am even more curious as to how only a Giant fan could somehow find a
way to tie L.A. fans into his team's 100% Fall Classic choke.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a good chance either trainer Blane Schvaneveldt or Paul Jones
will be standing in the winner's circle after tonight's 10th race.</LD>
<LD>   Schvaneveldt, Los Alamitos' winningest trainer, and Jones, the
leader in the current standings, will send out four of the seven
horses in the $12,850 allowance at 350 yards. The race is for
3-year-old fillies.</LD>
<LD>   McKaizlees Kiss, who had a decisive win in her second Los Alamitos
start on Oct. 12, and Easy Winning Deal will represent Schvaneveldt;
Chrom Illusion, who won her last start on Sept. 29, and Marmeta are
Jones' entrants.</LD>
<TE>   The other entrants are Casas Fame, who was third in her local
debut Oct. 24 after beginning her career in Wyoming and Idaho, Quicks
Trick, a longshot who has lost 13 of 14 in her career, and Cucus Bug,
who hasn't won in 2002 for trainer Donna McArthur.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. High Dispatch. 2. Cash Eleventh Wonder. 3. Stole. 4.
Babe With Rhythm. 5. Rodania Arbi. 6. Lost Pirate. 7. Faster Than
Cash. 8. Ano Lani. 9. Passat. 10. McKaizlees Kiss. 11. Biscotti.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Cuantemplate, Humphreys Begone and High Dispatch in the
first; Cash Eleventh Wonder, Meters Honor and Red Hot Tarasco in the
third; single Stole in the third and Babe With Rhythm, Scott Valley
and Alakolada in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: The Felix Payne-trained Petra Mbi should
improve in his second race after a layoff in the fifth. Coffee Buster
takes a big class drop in the eighth and makes his debut for Paul
Jones.</TE>

<HD>Pacers Handle Knicks With Usual Ease, 107-94</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the usually calm Jamaal Tinsley had to show some emotion,
pounding his chest as the disappointment of a slow start faded with
each jumper.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Artest scored 27 points, Tinsley had 14 points and 12 assists
and Brad Miller had 19 points as the Indiana Pacers defeated the New
York Knicks, 107-94, Friday at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   What once was one of the fiercest rivalries in the NBA -- the
teams met six times in the playoffs in the 1990s -- has become
one-sided in Indiana's favor. The Pacers have won at least two games
against the Knicks in each of the last five seasons, including eight
of the last nine at home.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacers had a 17-point first-half lead sliced to three in the
fourth mostly because of a career-high-tying 33 points by New York's
Kurt Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana used a 23-7 run late in the fourth and held Thomas to only
one field goal in the last eight minutes to improve to 3-0 at home.
Tinsley made two crucial mid-range jumpers and a three-point basket
in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He was shooting only 18% from the field this season, but he
thumped his chest with his right fist after making a 22-footer that
pushed the lead back to nine.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just so happy about hitting a big-time shot like that,"
said Tinsley, who missed shoot-around because of an upper respiratory
infection. "It wasn't anything against the Knicks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 114, Chicago 87 -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 24 points, and
Shawn Bradley had 11 rebounds and eight blocks as the Mavericks won
at Chicago. Eduardo Najera had 15 points and Chicago native Michael
Finley had 14 for the Mavericks, whose 5-0 start is the best in
franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 86, Portland 75 -- Stephon Marbury overcame a
poor-shooting first half and finished with 21 points and nine assists
to rally the Suns at Phoenix. Marbury missed his first seven shots
but scored 11 points to lead an up-tempo Phoenix offense to a
37-point third quarter, the Suns' highest-scoring quarter this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 110, Atlanta 97 -- Karl Malone returned to the Jazz lineup
after sitting out a game because of flu and scored a season-high 27
points at Salt Lake City. Malone also had season bests of 11 rebounds
and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 110, Golden State 104 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 32
points and P.J. Brown had 17 points and 16 rebounds at New Orleans as
the Hornets handed the Warriors their fifth consecutive loss and
improved to 4-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 108, Cleveland 84 -- Keith Van Horn made all four of
his three-point attempts and finished with 28 points to lead the
76ers at Philadelphia. Allen Iverson scored 17 points and had seven
assists despite a sprained right thumb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 105, Seattle 98 -- Grant Hill scored 27 points and had
nine assists to lead the Magic at Orlando, Fla. Tracy McGrady, going
for a third consecutive 40-point game, scored 23 -- 11 in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Baker Owes Back Taxes of More Than $1 Million</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former San Francisco Giant manager Dusty Baker owes more than $1
million in back taxes and penalties because of some bad investments
he made in the early 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Baker's Oakland-based tax attorney, Karen Hawkins, said Friday
that Baker invested in four tax shelters on the advice of his
brother.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins said the situation would be resolved by the end of this
year.</LD>
<TE>   Baker will interview with the Chicago Cubs on Monday about their
managerial opening. The team said Baker's tax situation will have no
bearing on his candidacy.</TE>

<TE>   The Angels' 2003 schedule doesn't include a Sunday night home game
for the first time since Disney bought the team in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Disney borrowed the concept of 5 p.m. Sunday starts from its
hockey team, the Mighty Ducks, believing families might prefer a
late-afternoon game to a 1 p.m. game.</TE>
<TE>   But Angel players -- and other employees -- preferred to spend
Sunday nights with their families, and opposing teams complained the
later starts caused them to arrive too late at their next
destinations.</TE>
<TE>   On Sundays this year, the Angels drew an average of 33,924 to 5
p.m. games and 32,270 to 1 p.m. games. For now, all Sunday games next
year are scheduled for 1 p.m., though one or two could be moved to 5
p.m. for a national ESPN broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' season opener -- and World Series championship
ceremony -- is scheduled for Monday, March 31, against the Texas
Rangers at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   The spring training schedule includes the renewal of the Freeway
Series against the Dodgers, for the first time in four years. The
teams will play March 28 at Dodger Stadium and March 29 at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bavasi, the Dodgers' director of player development and a
former Angel general manager, on Friday turned down an invitation to
interview for the Baltimore Orioles' general manager job. "I want to
be a GM again, and I would have been very willing to move -- that
would have been an exciting thing for my family," Bavasi said. "But
I'm not sure if I'm the right guy for them and if this is the right
move for me, so I've respectfully declined with thanks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans called the agent for Jesse Orosco
to express interest in the reliever Friday, but he wasn't ready to
offer a contract to the left-hander. "Jesse is one of the guys we're
considering," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Padres, meanwhile, have contacted agent Alan
Meersand about Orosco, and the Angels also are believed to be
interested in him. Orosco prefers to remain with the Dodgers but can
begin negotiating with other teams Tuesday.... The Dodgers declined
to pick up Chad Kreuter's $1.2-million option for 2003, choosing
instead to pay the reserve catcher a $300,000 buyout. Kreuter becomes
a free agent.</TE>

<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Sitting in a darkened Lambeau Field film room, Green Bay safety
Marques Anderson works a computer keyboard as skillfully as a
techno-geek. He taps in a command and a play from the Packer-Dolphin
game appears on the movie screen that fills one wall of the room. He
starts the play, then freezes the frame.</LD>
<LD>   "See this?" he says, pointing the cursor at himself against an
offensive lineman. "If I'd have gotten to his outside shoulder, I
could have stopped that run at the line of scrimmage. But Ricky
[Williams] got four yards. I've got to correct that."</LD>
<LD>   It was Tuesday morning, not even 12 hours after the Packers had
beaten the Dolphins on "Monday Night Football," and the players had
the day off. But Anderson, a rookie from UCLA, wasn't about to take a
break. He arrived early, after a fitful night, eager to check out the
video of fhis debut as the starting strong safety.</LD>
<TE>   Green Bay is a league-best 7-1, and quarterback Brett Favre has
received much of the credit for the strong start. But the Packer
defense is just as responsible, having surrendered one touchdown in
the last two games and an average of 12.8 points in the last five
games. That's down from an average of 33.3 points in their first
three games.</TE>
<TE>   The season is only half over and already Anderson twice has been
selected NFL rookie of the week. After hobbling through training camp
because of a hamstring injury, and being deactivated the first two
games, he intercepted passes by New England's Tom Brady and Detroit's
Joey Harrington -- an interception he returned 78 yards for a
touchdown. He also recovered fumbles in the Detroit and Miami games.
It's no wonder, then, his teammates have nicknamed him "Playmaker."
Not bad for a third-round selection, the 20th safety taken in the
2002 draft, who would have been a backup but for the surprise
retirement of LeRoy Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson had anticipated being chosen earlier and called his draft
experience "humbling." But nothing was quite so humbling as his
experience at UCLA, when he was one of the Bruins caught using a
handicapped-parking pass. That shameful episode led to Anderson's
missing the 1999 season as he was suspended for the fall quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was young and I made a mistake," said Anderson, who attended
Compton College during his UCLA suspension. "Now, I'm glad it
happened. It made me open my eyes and realize how much I had to lose,
how it could all go away so fast."</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the reasons Anderson isn't taking his situation for
granted. He spends as much time at the practice facility as anyone
and devotes most of his waking hours to working out, studying video,
practicing, anything to fine-tune his game. He started two games in
place of injured free safety Darren Sharper, then moved to strong
safety when Sharper returned to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's rare for a rookie," Sharper said. "A lot of guys will make
plays, but then they'll make a mistake and give up a big play.
Marques hasn't done that."</TE>
<TE>   The season is still young, of course, but Anderson is doing
everything he can to be as prepared as possible. That's not to say he
spends all his time thinking football. In the apartment he rents, he
has a flat-screen TV, a surround-sound system and a huge DVD
collection. He never misses "The Sopranos," and could watch
"Scarface" again and again.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his days at UCLA, where he was relatively anonymous when he
stepped off campus, Anderson is widely known in Green Bay. All the
Packers are.</TE>
<TE>   "The people here know your schedule," he said. "They know when
your day off is, when you're practicing, when you have to be at the
airport. They know what car you drive and where you live. Any store
you walk into, you've probably walked into it 15 times before, so
they know you there. The fans here are great -- they've always got
your back -- but it's kind of spooky."</TE>
<TE>   Spooky? Considering his almost clairvoyant knack for being around
the ball, the same might be said of Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parking Problem?</TE>
<TE>   All the rain Friday got me thinking: The Rose Bowl uses Brookside
Golf Course as a parking lot on UCLA football Saturdays, right? But
the regular season for college football ends in early December. The
NFL stretches through December, of course, when it tends to rain
more. The average December rainfall in the Arroyo Seco area isn't
overwhelming, 3.8 inches, but it's more than the total for July
through November.</TE>
<TE>   So, if the Rose Bowl becomes home to an NFL team, where will all
those spectators park if it's too wet to use the golf course
(assuming cart paths only isn't an option)?</TE>
<TE>   I called Pasadena City Councilman Steve Madison, who represents
the Linda Vista area, to ask about the rainy-day alternatives. He
didn't return the call -- perhaps a wise policy when the Rose Bowl's
surrounding streets are bumper to bumper with parked cars and those
angry phone calls start rolling in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- The Jets play host to Miami Sunday, which means lots
of barking back and forth. But there's no comeback for some trash
talk. "They're a little arrogant and they know that," Jet defensive
tackle Josh Evans said of the Dolphins, who won the teams' first
meeting, 30-3. "In the third or fourth quarter, we were jaw-jacking
at each other. One of them was like, 'Look at the score. We're fixing
to run down y'all's damn throat.' And they did, man. They kicked our
butt and made us like it." ... Trying to confuse Drew Bledsoe, the
Patriots used their "dollar" defense, which sometimes meant there
were six linebackers on the field and one defensive lineman with his
hand down. Other times, there were seven defensive backs and four
blitzing linebackers. "When you've lost four games in a row, you need
to try something different," linebacker Tedy Bruschi said. "It did
cause confusion for them sometimes. Us too." ... More evidence this
is one of the strangest seasons: The Jets, a few weeks ago one of the
league's worst teams, will be one game out of first in the division
if they beat the suddenly vulnerable Dolphins (5-3).</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- In the last two games, he has completed 78% of his
passes (39 of 50) for 456 yards with six touchdowns and no
interceptions. Who, Tom Brady? Brett Favre? Jeff Garcia? No. Believe
it or not, it's Cincinnati's Jon Kitna. His passer rating is a gaudy
144.25 over the last two games.... A season after setting a franchise
record with 48 sacks, the Bengals' defense is on track for fewer than
half of that, 20.... Lots of things are going wrong for the Browns,
but the kicking units have played pretty well. Through nine games,
those special teamers have returned two punts and one kickoff for
touchdowns, have blocked three field goals and executed two
successful onside kicks.... Cleveland players would have gotten their
entire bye week off, had they beaten Pittsburgh last Sunday, which
they didn't. That tickled Steeler safety Lee Flowers. "They were
supposed to get the week," Flowers said. "Now they're telling their
wives, 'Oh, baby, I can't come home. I've got to go to work
tomorrow.' " ... With Tommy Maddox firmly entrenched as the starting
quarterback, will Pittsburgh reprise Kordell Stewart's "Slash" role
as receiver-running back-quarterback? Not if Stewart has any say in
the matter. "I play quarterback," Stewart said. "Those days are over.
As far as doing those gadget plays, I'm a quarterback on this
football team. When an opportunity comes to play that position, I'll
go out and play. Other than that, I'll be sitting back and watching
and trying to help Tommy."</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- This is why the Colts would never work as an L.A.
team: They would be fading by the time the crowd showed up. In the
last three games, all Indianapolis losses, the Colts have fallen
behind by a combined 64-0 midway through the second quarter. They
trailed Tennessee, 23-0; Washington, 20-0; and Pittsburgh, 21-0....
Jacksonville has had five-game losing streaks the last two seasons
and now is one loss away from repeating that dubious distinction a
third time.... Spurrier is talking trash again. Not Steve Spurrier,
his 81-year-old mother. She lives in Jacksonville, Fla., and recently
told a reporter the Jaguars wouldn't be so bad had they hired her
son.... Rocky Boiman, a rookie linebacker for Tennessee, has some
nerve. He got in a practice-field fight this week with tight end
Frank Wycheck, one of the team's standout players. Then, after Boiman
had intercepted a pass intended for Wycheck, he spiked the ball at
the veteran's feet.... Cincinnati scored 38 unanswered points in a
victory over Houston last Sunday, prompting this from Texan tight end
Billy Miller: "They took their belts off and whipped us." Normally,
it's the Bengals being marched to the woodshed.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- Conspicuously absent from Kansas City's circus on
offense are Chief receivers Eddie Kennison and Johnnie Morton.
Combined, they have 38 receptions and three touchdowns. After
averaging 73 catches in his last five seasons with Detroit, Morton
has 16 at the midway point in Kansas City.... The Chiefs have blocked
kicks in each of the last three games -- a field goal against
Oakland, and punts against Denver and San Diego.... As if things
aren't bad enough for the Raiders, Charles Woodson tweaked his
hamstring in practice Wednesday and limped off the field. He was
coming off his first game in seven weeks because of a broken
shoulder.... The Chargers had a throwback helmet with "37" on the
side painted at midfield for last Sunday's game against the Jets. Was
that in honor of safety Rodney Harrison, suspended for the game after
an allegedly illegal hit? No, team officials said, it was in honor of
... uh, Charger great Hank Bauer. Yeah, that's the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- The Eagles have won three in a row, but they have to
be fretting about their offense. They have averaged 18.7 points a
game over that span, after averaging 33 points in their first five
games. Keeping them in contention is a defense that has surrendered
one touchdown in the last 12 quarters. In the last three weeks, the
Eagles have converted only two of 12 red-zone opportunities into
touchdowns, and Donovan McNabb has thrown one touchdown pass.... The
3-6 Cowboys are last in the division, and the playoffs are a pipe
dream, but don't call them cheap. Jerry Jones shelled out $41 million
for contract extensions, free-agent signings and draft picks. That
makes this season, which follows consecutive 5-11 disappointments,
particularly painful. "I never thought we'd have back-to-back 5-11
seasons, but this is a lot more frustrating and a lot more
disappointing," Jones told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. "Last year
was about the [salary] cap. We didn't have any money. This year, we
spent money. That was huge. That's the difference. To win three games
... that will make you look in the mirror." So long, Dave Campo.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Not much is going right for the Bears, who have the
league's longest losing streak, six. At least linebacker Brian
Urlacher is doing well. Without defensive tackle Ted Washington in
front of him, Urlacher is making tackles like crazy. He's averaging
10.4 a game and leads the NFL with 83 -- seven more than Zach
Thomas.... Detroit rookie quarterback Harrington was featured in a
Cosmopolitan article last month as one of the country's "50 hottest
hunks," and this week he's on the cover of Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- You might wonder what Atlanta's defense is doing
after big plays, crouching in a circle with one player wiggling his
fingers at the others like some sort of genie. The Falcons are
calling the celebration "Pass the Magic." Well, it beats the Dirty
Bird.... Speaking of superstitions, the Falcons have practiced
indoors during their four-game winning streak, even though the
weather has been unseasonably mild. "I've been wondering about that,"
receiver Shawn Jefferson told reporters this week. "It was awesome
outside [Nov. 1]. My experience with coaches is that when something
works, you don't change it." ... Carolina first-round pick Julius
Peppers has nine sacks through eight games, meaning he's on track to
shatter the rookie sack record held by Jevon Kearse, 14.5.... Talk
about a lifestyle change. Dwight Stone, a former standout
special-teamer for the Panthers, is now a Charlotte, N.C., police
officer. He was making $500,000 a season, and now makes $33,800 a
year. He rises at 4:15 every morning so he can get to his south
Charlotte district in time for 6:15 roll call. And he wouldn't change
a thing. "It's never the same -- no radio call, no hour, no second,"
he told the Charlotte Observer. "I love that about it."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- Garcia and Terrell Owens steal all the headlines, but
the unsung hero in the 49er offense is fullback Fred Beasley. With
Beasley as the lead blocker, the 49ers have rushed 137 times for 716
yards, an average of 5.2 yards. Without Beasley, they have rushed 66
times for 232 yards, an average of 3.5.... Be on the lookout for an
Owens-inspired Sharpie commercial that will air this weekend. The
15-second spot is set in a high school football locker room with the
coach delivering his pregame talk. He tells his players they should
leave their mark on the game, not on the football. The coach holds
out his hand as the players reach into their socks and grudgingly
hand over their Sharpie pens. Bet the folks at NFL headquarters are
in stitches.</TE>

<HD>Indianapolis Mayor Says Colts Will Stay</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis Colts are one of the NFL teams that could relocate
to Southern California, but not if Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson
has a say in the matter.</LD>
<LD>   "The Colts are not going to be leaving Indianapolis," Peterson
told reporters Friday after a two-hour meeting with Colt Owner Jim
Irsay to negotiate the team's long-term presence in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Irsay could not be reached for comment, but a city executive who
attended the meeting at team headquarters said the mood was "very
positive and very encouraging" for Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "We agreed that it was our mutual goal for the Colts to stay in
Indianapolis under a new agreement that runs beyond 2013," when the
current RCA Dome lease ends, said Fred Glass, president of the city
agency that owns the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Colt lease includes a conditional escape clause that can be
activated at the start of 2007. Peterson has indicated he is willing
to make payments that could exceed $10 million a year, possibly using
taxpayer money, to bring the Colts up to the league median in local
revenues and thereby void the escape clause.</TE>
<TE>   It's a politically sensitive situation for Peterson. He doesn't
want to be the mayor who lost the Colts, but he will be heavily
criticized if he makes too much of a sacrifice to keep the franchise.
He has described it as "a no-win situation from a political
standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Former San Diego Mayor Susan Golding was ridiculed for arranging a
ticket guarantee deal with the Chargers. Cleveland's Michael R. White
forever will be the mayor who lost the Browns, the Art Modell-owned
team that uprooted after the 1995 season and moved to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Irsay consistently has denied an interest in moving his team to
Los Angeles, although several league sources say he has been
investigating such a move for more than a year. In the past, he has
implied there may be ways out of the Indianapolis lease much sooner
than 2007.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. has been without an NFL team since the Raiders and Rams left
after the 1994 season. Officials from the Rose Bowl and Coliseum have
pushed their venues as potential NFL sites.</TE>
<TE>   Glass said he is optimistic the Colts will never get that far.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have acknowledged there is a lease," he said. "Both
sides want to hold up their obligations. There's no talk about either
side trying to weasel out of the lease."</TE>

<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (record)         Comment (last week's rank)
1     GREEN BAY  (7-1)      Brett Favre has made a huge contribution,
                            but this defense is underrated. (2)
2     DENVER  (6-2)         Mike Shanahan always wins when Oakland
                            comes to town. (4)
3     SAN FRANCISCO  (6-2)  49ers have a league-low seven turnovers
                            lost. (5)
4     PHILADELPHIA  (6-2)   Unlike the first five games, Eagles are
                            running far more than they pass. (3)
5     SAN DIEGO  (6-2)      The season could hinge on Sunday's game
                            at St. Louis. (1)
6     NEW ORLEANS  (6-2)    Getting Dale Carter back is huge for a
                            defense needing a cover corner. (7)
7     TAMPA BAY (7-2)       Erratic offense notwithstanding,
                            Buccaneers off to franchise-best start.
                            (8)
8     PITTSBURGH (5-3)      Tommy Maddox will get a chance to show
                            Dan Reeves how he has grown. (10)
9     NEW ENGLAND  (4-4)    Bill Belichick and his assistants called
                            a brilliant game against Buffalo. (18)
10    BUFFALO  (5-4)        Even with last Sunday's setback, Bills
                            are in good wild-card standing. (9)
11    ATLANTA (5-3)         Falcons have won four in a row for the
                            first time since 1998. (14)
12    KANSAS CITY (4-4)     Chief defense, nonexistent earlier in
                            season, is starting to come together.
                            (11)
13    ST. LOUIS  (3-5)      If hard-charging Rams lose two more, they
                            could be out of playoff picture. (15)
14    MIAMI (5-3)           Dolphin quarterback situation is a mess.
                            What's Aikman's number? (6)
15    TENNESSEE (4-4)       Of the Titans' final eight opponents,
                            only one has a winning record. (23)
16    OAKLAND (4-4)         Raider defense was on the field far too
                            long against the 49ers. (12)
17    WASHINGTON (4-4)      Kenny Watson could put a dent in
                            Jacksonville, ranked 26th vs. the run.
                            (24)
18    DETROIT  (3-5)        Lions haven't won at Lambeau Field since
                            1991. (20)
19    ARIZONA (4-4)         Cardinals had high hopes for receivers.
                            So far, no one has panned out. (13)
20    INDIANAPOLIS  (4-4)   No team goes through running backs faster
                            than the Colts. (16)
21    BALTIMORE  (3-5)      Jeff Blake has to be stoked to face
                            Cincinnati, his former employer. (17)
22    N.Y. JETS  (3-5)      Gang Green has a chance to prove victory
                            over Chargers was no fluke. (31)
23    JACKSONVILLE  (3-5)   Jaguars might want to make one more run
                            at Steve Spurrier on Sunday. (19)
24    N.Y. GIANTS (4-4)     The Giants have eight takeaways, fewest
                            in the league. (25)
25    CLEVELAND (4-5)       Highly touted rookie William Green is
                            averaging 2.3 yards a carry. (27)
26    CAROLINA  (3-5)       Rodney Peete is back, and that should
                            give Panthers a boost. (26)
27    DALLAS  (3-6)         Cowboys have shuffled the offensive line
                            eight times in nine games. (22)
28    SEATTLE  (2-6)        What's that faint sound? It's the clock
                            ticking on Mike Holmgren. (21)
29    MINNESOTA (2-6)       The Vikings would have an impressive
                            offense if they held onto the ball. (28)
30    CHICAGO (2-6)         With a tough schedule ahead, the picture
                            looks mighty bleak for Bears. (29)
31    HOUSTON  (2-6)        Even for an expansion team, the Texans
                            losing to Cincinnati was a joke. (30)
32    CINCINNATI  (1-7)     Bengals should get back on losing track
                            this week. (32)</TE>

<HD>Turco Wins Battle With Belfour, 2-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Belfour played well in his first game against his former teammates
since signing with Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   But Marty Turco, Belfour's former backup with the Dallas Stars,
was just a little better.</LD>
<LD>   Turco stopped 22 shots and the Stars got goals from Pierre Turgeon
and Jason Arnott in their 2-1 victory over the Maple Leafs on Friday
night at Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels good now that it's over," Turco said of the much-hyped
goaltending matchup. "It meant a little more with Eddie back here."</TE>
<TE>   Turco made his best stop of the night with 29 seconds left, coming
up with an outstanding glove save to deny Bryan McCabe from 25 feet.
Toronto had an extra attacker after Belfour skated to the bench with
57 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Belfour, who made 21 saves, was Dallas' starter for five seasons,
backstopping the Stars' Stanley Cup run in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Vincent Lecavalier had three goals as
the Southeast Division-leading Lightning ended a three-game losing
streak with a victory at Tampa, Fla. Fredrik Modin had the other goal
for Tampa Bay, now 5-0 at home and off to a franchise-best start of
8-4-2 overall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 4, Edmonton 2 -- Dave Scatchard scored twice,
and Chris Osgood made 31 saves at Uniondale, N.Y., as the Islanders
ended a six-game losing streak. Adrian Aucoin and Shawn Bates also
scored for the Islanders, who got two assists from Brad Isbister.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Had Computer Access to Bets</HD>
<DH>Software engineer, who has not been charged in Breeders'
Cup pick six dispute, was 'trusted fellow' cleared to review wagers
nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when federal authorities formally joined the investigation
into a suspicious bet worth more than $3 million placed during
Breeders' Cup races last month, more details emerged about the
software engineer at the center of the inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI and U.S. attorney's office confirmed Friday they are
assisting New York state police with a case that so far has focused
on Chris Harn of Newark, Del. Authorities want to know if he and two
acquaintances conspired to rig the Breeders' Cup pick six bet by
entering a tote computer system to insert winning horses after four
of the six races were run.</LD>
<LD>   No charges have been filed and Harn's attorney has said his client
did nothing illegal. But Harn was fired last week from the company
whose computers handled the bet.</LD>
<TE>   Sources close to Autotote Systems Inc., speaking on condition of
anonymity, portrayed Harn as "a trusted fellow, a senior guy" who was
dismissed because "he betrayed our trust."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old worked as a systems expert at the company's
Delaware location. "Like a doctor ... it was his job to log in and
make sure everything was OK," a source said. Harn's position afforded
him a password to access wagers being placed through racetracks and
off-track sites nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion arose after there had been six winning pick six wagers
even with longshot winners of 13-1, 26-1 and 43-1 in the Breeders'
Cup races at Arlington Park outside of Chicago on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Racing officials were startled to learn all six winning pick six
wagers were contained in one ticket, which was bet through an
off-track account in upstate New York by a Baltimore man named
Derrick Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Davis had employed the unusual strategy of "singling"
the first four races -- picking only one horse to win -- and betting
every horse in the fifth and sixth races.</TE>
<TE>   Racing officials withheld the payoff and New York authorities got
involved because the bet originated in their state. Alerted to the
situation, Autotote executives knew where to look.</TE>
<TE>   Under the computer protocol used by American tote companies, pick
six bets are handled in a certain way: If placed from an off-site
location, they do not reach the track where the races are being run
until after the fourth race of the pick six is finished. This delay,
industry executives say, helps keep computer networks from jamming.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 18 Autotote employees have clearance to access this
information while it awaits transfer. Sources suggested that a
slightly smaller number had access to the system on Oct. 26 and were
in a position to change Davis' bet before it was transmitted to
Arlington Park, if in fact that happened.</TE>
<TE>   Autotote executives reviewed pick six betting from that day and, a
source said, "we found a suspicious activity and handed it over to
the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   Though Harn has not been charged, the source said: "He had studied
the system and, with extensive knowledge, had figured a weakness. We
believe he took that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities connected Harn to Davis, the man who placed the bet,
through their days at Drexel University  in the 1990s, where they
reportedly lived in the same fraternity house. Davis' attorney denied
the "wild accusations" leveled at his client.</TE>
<TE>   Another man who lived in the fraternity house -- Glen DaSilva of
New York -- is also under investigation. Davis and DaSilva had
accounts with Catskill Off-Track Betting Corp., through which they
could bet by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Breeders' Cup, authorities have scrutinized
other wagers.</TE>
<TE>   Questions remain about two winning bets made from DaSilva's phone
account -- a pick four on Oct. 3 at Balmoral Park, near Chicago, and
a pick six on Oct. 5 at Belmont Park in New York. Officials have
characterized those bets as potential dry runs for the Breeders' Cup
bet. Two wagers at Saratoga Race Course in New York -- unrelated to
Davis or DaSilva -- have been cleared.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation has sent shivers through the sport. This
incident couldn't have come at a worse time, attendance continuing to
decline at tracks nationwide, the industry losing more and more
business to state lotteries and casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School who has studied
gambling, said tote companies have traditionally been the least of
racing's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like nothing compared to the day-to-day worries about
drugging horses and fixing races," he said. "If there was anything
wrong with this part of the industry, it was probably that they were
so good at keeping games honest, they got overconfident."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. announced an
emergency plan to look for irregularities in all winning multi-race
bets. Within 30 days, tote companies will be required to scan
multi-race pools after each race, thereby eliminating the delay that
might be used to alter bets.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken the challenge very seriously," NTRA Commissioner Tim
Smith said. "We'll do anything necessary to protect our customers and
earn their confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Autotote executives said they will comply with the plan and will
consider instituting an independent and redundant system to further
identify tampering.</TE>
<TE>   With investigators looking for evidence of a federal crime on
their premises, and race fans wondering about their computers, the
executives bristled at the notion they cannot keep wagering honest.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there room for improvement? Sure," a source said. "But the key
issue here is, we have a very simple case of one person betraying
trust. And you have to remember, we caught this guy."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United States World Cup team defender Frankie Hejduk found himself in
an embarrassing situation Friday when his club, St Gallen in
Switzerland, took out a full-page notice in a local newspaper
apologizing for an 11-3 loss Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We, the players of FC St Gallen, made fools of ourselves," said
the notice in the St Gallen TagBlatt.</LD>
<LD>   It was accompanied by a team photograph and signed by each member
of the team, including Hejduk, and Coach Thomas Staub, who was fired
after the loss to lowly FC Wil.</LD>
<TE>   "We know you are the best fans in Switzerland and we've let you
down. We are sorry. Unfortunately, we cannot turn back the clock."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper, not coincidentally, is the team's sponsor.</TE>

<TE>   England Chosen</TE>
<TE>   European soccer's ruling body, UEFA, selected England to host the
European Women's Championship in 2005, meaning that England's team
will qualify automatically for the eight-nation finals.</TE>
<TE>   England has never progressed beyond the semifinals in the previous
five championships and will fail to qualify for the 2003 Women's
World Cup in China unless it defeats France next week in France</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenedy Suspended</TE>
<TE>   Portugal national team midfielder Daniel Kenedy was suspended for
18 months by the Portuguese league's disciplinary committee after
failing a drug test last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Kenedy, who plays for Maritimo, also was dropped from Portugal's
World Cup team. He said he would appeal the ruling, claiming all he
had taken were slimming pills to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Match Fixing</TE>
<TE>   Twenty Vietnamese players, believed to include members of the
national team, face a possible lifetime worldwide ban after a police
undercover investigation turned up evidence that they had conspired
to fix matches.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of a game-fixing syndicate have been arrested as a
result of the probe, and the Asian Football Confederation is awaiting
action by the Vietnamese federation before taking any steps itself.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Velappan, general secretary of the AFC, will meet with
Vietnamese soccer and government officials in Hanoi next week to
discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   He said the problem extended to other countries in Indo-China.</TE>

<HD>Venus Turns Back Seles</HD>
<DH>Williams rallies from 1-4 first-set deficit to win, 7-5,
6-4, in quarterfinal of WTA Championships.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venus Williams, tennis star and critic, probably had the most
accurate, and succinct view, of her unpredictable match against
Monica Seles.</LD>
<LD>   Good plays, bad plays and amazing plays, Williams summarized.</LD>
<LD>   When Williams faces Seles, those things have a way of happening,
not only in the same set, but in the same game. They managed to bring
out a higher level of shot-making from one another, as the No.
2-seeded Williams defeated No. 6 Seles, 7-5, 6-4, in 1 hour 39
minutes at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Friday night's match was something of a tonic for what was been an
ailing event, the Home Depot WTA Championships. Though Seles saved
seven match points in her three-set victory against Lindsay Davenport
in the first round, the quality of play between Seles and Williams
was far superior.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, there was the feel of a crowd attending an event,
not merely a few bodies rattling around in an empty hangar. Seles
even acknowledged it afterward with a small sigh of relief. An
estimated 4,500 were on hand for the Seles-Williams quarterfinal,
which was easily the largest crowd for any session.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to see that," Seles said. "The first year it's very
difficult. They're probably going to have to do a lot more
promotions. A lot of my friends here had no idea why I was in town."</TE>
<TE>   Seles said the process will take some time. Having said that, the
field is better than most years; the season-ending event has never
featured both Serena and Venus Williams in the same year. Serena
Williams won the Championships last year in Munich, and Venus has
participated only once, reaching the semifinals in 1999. If the
sisters stick to their policy of skipping Indian Wells, the next time
they appear in Southern California is the summer of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Matches with the sort of competitive quality displayed by Williams
and Seles will help push the tournament's development. Seles, who
beat Venus in three sets in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open
in January, is the only player other than Serena to defeat Venus in a
Grand Slam event this year.</TE>
<TE>   The way she opened against Williams, taking a 4-1 lead in the
first set, it looked as though Seles might be poised for her second
victory against Venus in their 10 meetings. Venus, though, slowly
started to find her range and came up with some big shots, and a bit
of luck, to tie it, 4-4. She saved four break points in that game,
including one net-cord winner.</TE>
<TE>   One game, in particular, stood out as an example of the match's
closeness. Williams, serving at 2-3 in the second set, fought off two
break points and battled through nine deuces. Seles was able to break
serve three times in the match, but was hurt by her own serve,
hitting only one ace and double-faulting nine times. Williams had 11
aces and 44 winners and regularly hit her serve faster than 110 mph.
"I didn't want to lose," said Williams, who will play No. 5 Kim
Clijsters in the semifinals. "I don't know, I'm really used to
winning."</TE>
<TE>   Williams has always been a fan of Seles, graciously handling the
loss at the Australian Open. But she was more effusive than usual
about Seles, rattling off scores of the past when Seles dominated the
tour in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember all those things," Williams said. "She was my favorite
player. I was always rooting for her. Of course when we play now, I'm
rooting for me."</TE>
<TE>   Now, that famous Seles grunt lives on in the form of Williams.
Venus wanted to be like Monica in every way possible ... except for
the two-handed forehand.</TE>
<TE>   "I started grunting because I wanted to be like Monica. I never
grunted before. Now I can't stop," Williams said, laughing. "I
started doing things like her. She was a revolutionary. It always
comes around to someone who takes the game to another level, and
makes everyone realize, 'Hey, I've got to step it up also.' "</TE>

<HD>A Sorry Exhibition by Henin in Defeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question of the day: Will the Kim Clijsters-Justine Henin exhibition
next week in their home country, Belgium, be more competitive than
their quarterfinal match at the Home Depot WTA Championships on
Friday afternoon? The standard to surpass is not high.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-hitting Clijsters did not encounter much resistance,
especially after the first set, as she routed the fourth-seeded
Henin, 6-2, 6-1, in 59 minutes at Staples Center before an estimated
500 fans. Henin looked as though she was going through the motions,
holding serve only once in the second set and winning one point in
the final two games.</LD>
<LD>   In the semifinals, No. 5 Clijsters will face No. 2 Venus Williams,
who beat No. 6 Monica Seles, 7-5, 6-4, in the night session.</LD>
<TE>   Clijsters is 5-2 against Henin, her childhood friend and junior
traveling partner, and has always won their most important matches,
in the 2001 French Open semifinals, the 2002 Australian Open
quarterfinals and Friday's meeting at the $3-million season-ending
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Henin had five winners to 15 for Clijsters, and committed 33
unforced errors to Clijsters' 22.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really tired during the match, and I felt without energy,"
said Henin, who is being married next week but said that has not been
an emotional distraction.</TE>
<TE>   The players talk about being exhausted but undercut their
arguments about the season being too long by agreeing to appear in
postseason exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters and Henin have the upcoming event in Belgium, and seven
other players in the field -- Seles, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer
Capriati, Jelena Dokic, Daniela Hantuchova and Venus and Serena
Williams -- are playing a special event in Dublin next month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There has been a change in tonight's schedule. The doubles match
featuring Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain and Paola Suarez of
Argentina against Ai Sugiyama and Rika Fujiwara of Japan is to start
at 6, followed by the final quarterfinal between No. 8 Dokic and No.
1 Serena Williams. Dokic-Williams will not start before 8.</TE>

<DH>In hockey hotbed of Montreal, critics scrutinize MVP goalie
Theodore after he starts slowly</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>All who enter the Canadiens' locker room at the Bell Centre, whether
player or pilgrim to hockey's mecca, must pass a massive, shiny black
wall that bears the engraved name of every Canadien who has won a
significant NHL award.</LD>
<LD>   Among the winners of the Hart Trophy, given to the league's most
valuable player, are Hall of Famers Toe Blake, Elmer Lach, Jean
Beliveau, Bernard Geoffrion, Jacques Plante and Guy Lafleur. Past
winners of the Vezina Trophy, presented to the league's top
goaltender, include Plante, Ken Dryden and Patrick Roy.</LD>
<LD>   The newest name on those two prestigious lists is Jose Theodore,
who last season led the undersized, under-talented Canadiens to the
second round of the playoffs and joined Plante and Detroit's Dominik
Hasek as the only goalies who have won the Hart and Vezina trophies
in the same season.</LD>
<TE>   Whether by chance or design, Theodore's seat is directly across
from that impressive wall. When the 26-year-old native of the
Montreal suburb of Laval looks up after unlacing his skates, it
gleams in the background; as he walks toward the ice, it silently
reminds him of the standards he is expected to uphold.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the wall I've been looking at since I was 20," said
Theodore, who was a second-round draft pick by Montreal in 1994 but
didn't play regularly until the 2000-01 season. "I know the names by
heart. To finally look up and see my name is something that is a big
steppingstone in my career.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it was my dream to win the Vezina when I was a kid. But
last year, during the season, I didn't realize I had a chance until
after the season. Being able to win those two major awards is
something nobody can ever take away from me."</TE>
<TE>   But this is Montreal, where fans and media ask
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately in two languages and every lineup
change can become the stuff of soap operas. As Theodore works through
a bumpy beginning that included giving up six goals in two successive
starts against Buffalo and Philadelphia and one victory in his first
seven games, Theodore is learning that dreaming is nice, but stopping
pucks is better.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Theodore -- who had a 2.11 goals-against average
and .931 save percentage last season -- didn't become complacent
after signing a five-year, $26.5-million deal in the off-season. But
the Theodore of the first month of the season wasn't the sure,
inspiring goalie that led the Canadiens to a surprise playoff berth
last season. It took a 42-save shutout against the flailing New York
Islanders Thursday to improve his goals-against average from 4.06 to
3.53, and to lift his save percentage from a porous .861 to a still
less than glorious .886.</TE>
<TE>   He seems to have developed no major flaws besides maybe being a
split-second behind plays and being unlucky enough that the puck
simply wasn't hitting him, as it would hit a goalie who instinctively
gets into position to block shots. He's not the first goalie to lose
a bit of his mystique, and he won't be the last. "We have no doubts
about him," team captain Saku Koivu said.</TE>
<TE>   But this is Montreal, where every hiccup is treated like a major
disorder. And the Canadiens, who play host to the Kings tonight at
the Bell Centre, need Theodore to be consistently sharp if they are
to earn a playoff berth in the tight Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at a guy who's got a great work ethic," said Coach
Michel Therrien, who started backup Jeff Hackett five times in an
eight-game stretch while Theodore worked his way back to his old
form. "That's one reason he had such a great season last year. He got
a start he wasn't looking for, but last week we gave him an
opportunity to practice hard and get his game where it's supposed to
be.... We're all satisfied he's going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Hackett, 34, believes his young teammate has merely hit a bump in
what will be a long and successful road. Early in the season, Hackett
said he expected he and his $3.6-million salary would be traded to
accommodate Theodore's new $5-million price tag, but he has played
too well -- and Theodore too inconsistently -- for Montreal to make a
move yet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not struggling," Hackett said of Theodore, whom he has
mentored. "He's played well. Sometimes you get a post, sometimes you
don't get a post. In goaltending, you can't be an egomaniac and think
you can control everything out there. You need support. You need help
from everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there's a couple of games where he didn't think he was
sharp. But it wasn't like he was way off his game or way out of sync.
It's just little things here and there. He's right there."</TE>
<TE>   Goaltending has been something of a black hole for the Canadiens
since a piqued Roy demanded and got a trade in 1995, a mistake the
Canadiens paid for until Theodore emerged last season. But until he
and they are sure his mastery has returned, he will be bombarded with
more questions than pucks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my fifth season here," Hackett said, "and the only season
there wasn't [controversy] was my first season. It's getting old
quick. The problem is, there's one net and two guys."</TE>
<TE>   Theodore will eventually prevail over Hackett because the team has
too much invested in him, financially and emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of games weren't going the way I wanted to, but
it's still early in the season," Theodore said. "I'm just working to
get back to my 'A' game. It's a matter of working hard and doing a
lot of little things, paying attention to details. Sometimes it
doesn't take much."</TE>
<TE>   He's also smart enough to realize his turnaround can't come soon
enough to please the demanding fans.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a goalie in Montreal, there's always pressure, and
this is no different," he said. "I just approach the game the same
way every night."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hackett: "It's nice to see a young guy come in and work as
hard as he does. That's what I'm proud most about. Not just how he's
done, but how he's stuck with it. When he first got here the media
said he wasn't good enough to play here and I said that was
ludicrous. He just needed more time to develop."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he just needs more time to regain his footing -- and for his
teammates to provide the kind of defensive support they mustered
during their late push last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, everything depends on how we play as a team," Theodore
said. "If we play well as a team that's when we have success. We're
not allowed to have any letdowns. Everybody has to show up."</TE>
<TE>   Including the Theodore of last season. The one whose name is on
the wall.</TE>

<HD>Bruins Learn There Are Good Numbers in Safety</HD>

<LD>Necessity, UCLA has discovered, is the mother not of invention, but
of convention.</LD>
<LD>   Play calling has become less adventurous yet more effective since
senior quarterback Cory Paus was injured three games ago. With
freshman quarterbacks at the helm, game plans have been appropriately
prudent.</LD>
<LD>   Risks are few. Victories result.</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins more closely resemble Oklahoma, Ohio State and Notre
Dame these days, winning with defense and special teams while keeping
the offense from sabotaging the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Win with defense, don't lose it on offense," Coach Bob Toledo
said.</TE>
<TE>   That's his freshly minted motto.</TE>
<TE>   And he ought to keep it in mind, even when Drew Olson and Matt
Moore are veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Give Toledo an experienced quarterback and he can't help but make
like Leonard Tose at a craps table, taking needless chances, then
pulling back at the wrong time and suffering unimagined losses.</TE>
<TE>   It's entertaining in a mad-scientist sort of way, but collateral
damage is significant. The Bruin defense tires from spending too much
time on the field and Bruin fans become exasperated because
consistency is nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   For Toledo, losing Paus was like dropping his stack of $100 chips
on one bad hand, then having to move to the nickel slots. But a funny
thing happened while the coach was kicking his gambling jones.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins beat Stanford two weeks ago with Moore making his first
college appearance. Toledo kept the offense simple and Moore made no
fatal mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (6-3, 3-2) defeated Washington last week in similar
fashion. Olson started for the first time and overcame a hostile
crowd by sticking to a sensible game plan that emphasized field
position and ball control.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither freshman completed half of his passes, neither
threw an interception. And both connected enough to keep defenses
honest and enable tailback Tyler Ebell to extend his 100-yard rushing
streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   With Olson at the controls again tonight, the same approach
figures to be enough to beat Arizona (3-6, 0-5), the worst team in
the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative play calling "has worked because, unlike the past, we
are playing good defense," Toledo said. "We don't have to take a lot
of chances."</TE>
<TE>   In his seventh season as a head coach, it seems he has finally
stopped thinking like the offensive coordinator he used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Coordinators a lot of times are concerned with stats," he said.
"As a head coach I'm interested in winning. I'm recognizing when the
defense is playing well and calling plays accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   So he'll continue to feed the nickel slots from a seat that has
gotten considerably cushier. The heat he felt after questionable
play-calling contributed to close losses to Oregon and California has
dissipated.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, the expectation level was so high, then came the pin
in the balloon," Toledo said. "This year, old guys want to win and
young guys want to impress and build for the future. It's a great
mix. There is unity and chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having fun coaching. We were picked to come in sixth. Nobody
expected us to beat anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Having come this far, though, the Bruins are not expected to lose
to Arizona, a team that is running backward.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats had minus-23 yards rushing against Oregon State last
week and minus-17 yards rushing two weeks ago against Washington
State. In the last five weeks, they are averaging 7.2 yards a game on
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The season-ending injury a month ago to Clarence Farmer, who led
the Pac-10 in rushing last season, has been devastating.</TE>
<TE>   "We really, truly would have liked to run the ball," Coach John
Mackovic said. "But we've reversed it and now we throw to set up the
run."</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Jason Johnson has passed for a respectable
2,433 yards, but Mackovic said freshman Nic Costa will get playing
time against UCLA. In other words, the Wildcats have given up on the
season and are looking to the future.</TE>
<TE>   For UCLA, the march is toward a bowl game. A victory and the
Bruins are assured of playing somewhere. At worst, the Las Vegas
Bowl. At best, although it's a long shot, the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Toledo's days as a high roller appear over for now.
He's even preaching caution to Olson and Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them both," he said. "The big thing is, don't make the
mistake that gets us beat."</TE>

<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Tyler Ebell, who reached 100 yards rushing against the
top Pac-10 rushing defense last week, might challenge 200 yards
against the soft Arizona flex defense, which is last in the
conference against the run. Running back Manuel White will play for
the first time since injuring a hamstring five weeks ago. Senior
linebacker Lance Briggs is the top Wildcat defender. Quarterback Drew
Olson will be given the opportunity to throw downfield more than last
week, but the emphasis will remain on the freshman not making
critical mistakes. Backup Matt Moore will play at least one series.
Arizona has only three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN ARIZONA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats set a school record for fewest total yards in a game
with 93 last week against Oregon State and have rushed for negative
yardage in two consecutive games. Jason Johnson is still a dangerous
passer, however, and with 2,433 yards passing, he needs only 88 to
surpass Tom Tunnicliffe as the school record holder. Backup
quarterback Nic Costa is expected to play. Receiver Bobby Wade has
eight 100-yard receiving games in the last 12 and ranks fifth
all-time in the Pac-10 with 208 catches. Wade has 71 catches this
season and also leads the conference with a 13.6 punt-return average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Flex mental muscles: Freshman quarterback Olson and freshman
center Mike McCloskey must avoid getting confused by Arizona's flex
defense and make sound protection calls.</TE>
<TE>   2. Easy does it: Neither Olson nor Moore has thrown an
interception in the last two games. The freshman quarterbacks must
continue to avoid mistakes even while opening up the offense in
measured increments.</TE>
<TE>   3. Rush week: The weak Wildcat running attack gives a green light
to defensive end Dave Ball and other Bruin pass rushers to zero in on
quarterbacks Johnson and Costa.</TE>

<HD>What's Up Front Can't Be Counted</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The effectiveness of offensive linemen often is difficult to
quantify. So the way UCLA blockers see it, numbers put up by the
likes of Tyler Ebell rightly qualify as their own.</LD>
<LD>   Especially when they spot a trend. UCLA has had a 100-yard rusher
12 times in the last two seasons.</LD>
<LD>   That's a definite source of pride among the guys up front.</LD>
<TE>   "When a running play is called, there is a different sense of
urgency in the huddle," guard Eyoseph Efseaff said. "We get to pound
some meat and get some knockdowns. We are roaring off the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell has had five consecutive 100-yard games. He broke the UCLA
freshman rushing record against Washington and, with 734 yards, is on
pace to break the Pacific 10 Conference freshman record set by
Stanford's Darrin Nelson with 1,069 in 1977. Ken Simonton of Oregon
State is the only other Pac-10 freshman to have gained 1,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, DeShaun Foster had six 100-yard efforts in eight
games before he was suspended. Akil Harris added another 100-yard
game in the season finale.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Seidman leads the nation's tight ends, averaging 57.78 yards
receiving a game, and is within reach of Paul Bergmann's UCLA records
for catches and yards by a tight end.</TE>
<TE>   Bergmann had 44 catches in 1983 and 577 yards in 1982. Seidman, a
senior, has 31 catches for 520 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manuel White will play a little at fullback and a little at
tailback today. The emphasis will be on "little" for the very large
running back because he is coming off a hamstring injury that
sidelined him for four games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in good cardiovascular shape, but not in great running
shape," Coach Bob Toledo said. "We'll bring him along slowly [today],
then we have a bye week, so by the time we play USC he should be able
to contribute more.</TE>
<TE>   White, a 240-pound sophomore, rushed for 231 yards in the first
four games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second game in a row, Bruin captains will not include any
high-profile skill-position players.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, only two of the four are starters -- tackle Mike Saffer,
who grew up in Tucson, and defensive end Dave Ball, who had three
sacks last week. The other captains are senior reserve receiver Jon
Dubravac, who has played well on special teams, and senior defensive
tackle Sean Phillips, who is expected to get substantial playing time
because Ryan Boschetti missed two practices this week with a bruised
shin.</TE>
<TE>   Against Washington, captains were kicker-punter Nate Fikse, tackle
Bryce Bohlander, defensive tackle Steve Morgan and linebacker Brandon
Chiller.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Can't Afford to Forget Cardinal Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>The Rose Bowl or, possibly, another BCS bowl game beckons.</LD>
<LD>   The regular-season stretch run includes games against surprising
Arizona State, rival UCLA and rejuvenated Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   But if No. 10 USC is to realize any of its major bowl game
aspirations, the Trojans cannot afford to stumble today in a Pacific
10 Conference game against struggling Stanford.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't look past anybody -- especially Stanford," Trojan wide
receiver Kareem Kelly said. "That's a team that some of us have never
won a game against."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which defeated Oregon for the first time in five years two
weeks ago, has not defeated Stanford since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But Stanford's winning streak against USC was achieved under Coach
Tyrone Willingham, who guided the Cardinal back to national
prominence before he was hired by Notre Dame last Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Buddy Teevens has not enjoyed similar success since arriving from
Florida, where he was the assistant offensive coordinator to
pass-happy Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford is 2-6 overall and 1-4 in conference play. San Jose State
and Arizona are the only teams the Cardinal has defeated.</TE>
<TE>   A school with a long tradition of strong-armed quarterbacks ranks
last in the Pac-10 in passing and ninth in scoring. The Cardinal is
third in the conference in rushing but is averaging only 22.5 points
and has not scored more than 18 in any of its last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter," sophomore defensive end Kenechi Udeze said.
"Stanford's a team that would like nothing better than to spoil
things for us. We can't let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   It happened against the Cardinal in each of the last three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, USC blew a 21-0 first-quarter lead and lost, 35-31, at
the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Stanford scored 12 points in the final 5:22 and
won, 32-30, when quarterback Chris Lewis connected with Jamien
McCullum on a 20-yard touchdown pass play with no time left at
Stanford Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, in the fourth game on USC's schedule, Stanford built
a 21-0 lead and held on for a 21-16 victory at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we played them a couple games after losing to Kansas
State," USC middle linebacker Mike Pollard said. "I'm not going to
say we didn't know what we were doing, but there was uncertainty. Now
we know what we have to do to reach our goal."</TE>
<TE>   USC (6-2, 4-1) looked sure of itself two weeks ago against Oregon
when the Trojans amassed 608 yards in a 44-33 victory at Eugene.
Quarterback Carson Palmer possibly vaulted into the Heisman Trophy
race by passing for a school-record 448 yards and tying a school
record with five touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   A bye allowed numerous players with nagging injuries to heal or
improve their condition going into today's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a player on our team who didn't benefit
from the break," said Kelly, who is still nursing a sprained right
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said the Trojans spent the week preparing to
face Lewis at quarterback. The redshirt junior sat out the last two
games because of a bruised shoulder, but he is expected to play
against a Trojan team that features several former Long Beach Poly
High teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman Kyle Matter from Newhall started the last two
games and redshirt sophomore Ryan Eklund also played.</TE>
<TE>   "If Chris Lewis is playing, they can use every aspect of that
offense, and that makes it very difficult," Carroll said. "His
ability to be effective getting out of the pocket and making good
decisions is something we're concerned about."</TE>

<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are not expected to repeat the 608-yard performance
they turned in against Oregon two weeks ago, but it could be another
big day for the offense. Carson Palmer is completing a
conference-best 62% of his passes. Justin Fargas will start again at
tailback, but Sultan McCullough probably will get more than the two
carries he had against Oregon. Wide receiver Kareem Kelly used the
bye week to rest his injured right ankle, making a Trojan receiving
corps that also includes freshman Mike Williams and junior Keary
Colbert even more formidable. Stanford sophomore safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe, senior safety Colin Branch and junior middle linebacker Jake
Covault lead a defense that ranks seventh in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN STANFORD HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal, a veritable passing machine through the years, ranks
last in the Pac-10 in passing at 181.4 yards a game. Quarterback
Chris Lewis, a redshirt junior from Long Beach, did not play the last
two games because of a bruised shoulder, but the Trojans expect to
see him. Redshirt freshman Kyle Matter from Newhall started the last
two games. Wide receiver Teyo Johnson, who stands 6 feet 7 inches,
has 31 receptions; tight end Alex Smith 23. The Cardinal ranks third
in the conference in rushing at 149.4 yards a game. Kerry Carter
averages 48 yards, Casey Moore 41.8.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Avoid complacency. USC is in contention for the Rose Bowl and
cannot afford to look past the Cardinal with games against No. 25
Arizona State, UCLA and No. 9 Notre Dame coming up.</TE>
<TE>   2. Maintain the running game. Fargas helped open up the passing
game against Oregon and the Trojans need another productive day from
their tailbacks to keep the Cardinal guessing.</TE>
<TE>   3. Special teams. This is a perfect opportunity for the Trojans to
play a complete game. No blocked field-goal and extra-point attempts
would be a good place to start.</TE>

<LD>Freshman Tom Malone ranks as the top punter in the Pacific 10
Conference and USC's offense and defense are near the top in several
categories.</LD>
<LD>   But the punt return and kickoff return units hope to improve their
conference-worst rankings today when the Trojans play Stanford at
Stanford Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   USC is averaging only 6.5 yards per punt return. Walk-on receiver
Greig Carlson from Palisades High  has provided sure hands on the 16
kicks he has handled, but he has yet to return one longer than 14
yards.</LD>
<TE>   "My main job is to make sure I catch the ball -- that's why they
put me back there," Carlson said. "Hopefully, this is a game I can
show a little more of what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   USC is averaging 16.1 yards per kickoff return. The Trojans,
thanks in part to a defense that is giving up only 19.9 points a
game, have fielded only 15 kickoffs -- seven fewer than the
next-closest teams in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC has not scored 40 points in three consecutive games since
1972, but the Trojans could equal that feat today against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal is surrendering a conference-worst average of 33.4
points a game. Stanford gave up 65 points against Arizona State on
Sept. 28 and 41 last week against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Stanford, the Cardinal is trying to win four
consecutive games against USC for the second time in series history.</TE>
<TE>   But USC maintains that three Cardinal victories -- in 1911, 1912,
1913 -- were achieved in rugby, not football, and does not count the
games in its overall record or series record against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   USC lists its series record against Stanford at 53-24-3. Stanford
lists it as 53-28-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Stanford players have ties to USC.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman cornerback Marcus McCutcheon is the brother of Cleveland
Brown defensive back Daylon McCutcheon, who played at USC in 1995-98.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Cobb, a senior cornerback, is the son of former Trojan
linebacker Garry Cobb, who played at USC in 1976-78 and in the NFL
for 11 years.</TE>

<DH>When 0-8 teams meet, it means little to fans but everything
to players</DH>

<LD>On rain-soaked fields across Southern California Friday night, dozens
of high school football games were played that had playoff and
league-championship implications. But no game meant more to the
players involved than the one for sixth place in the seven-team
Garden Grove League.</LD>
<LD>   Westminster La Quinta and Garden Grove Bolsa Grande both came in
with 0-8 records, and players from both schools knew this was their
best chance for a victory.</LD>
<LD>   La Quinta got it, 32-8, in a game played through a thick fog and
before about 200 fans at Bolsa Grande High.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels great," said La Quinta running back Minh Ngo, who rushed
for 223 yards and a touchdown in 23 carries. "The whole team worked
hard for this every day."</TE>
<TE>   The team celebrated the victory by tackling Coach Guy Gardner in
inch-thick mud on the sidelines. "We're going to have a fun bus ride
home," Gardner said. "We've been waiting for this ride."</TE>
<TE>   For Bolsa Grande, there was one minor victory. A touchdown. With a
few seconds left in the game, quarterback Jonathan Gonzalez scored on
an eight-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   "That will help keep them up," Bolsa Grande Coach Jim Lamb said.
"They stuck with it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   For Bolsa Grande, any victories will continue to come outside the
win-loss column. They'll be in the form of a receiver who has
mastered a new route, the personal growth of a 5-foot-8 quarterback
who can barely see over his linemen, the pride that comes from
scoring a rare touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it is when you're 0-for-the-season, own a 33-game
losing streak and have one win in five years -- a span of 55 games.
The Matadors lost other league games this season by scores of 48-6
and 44-6.</TE>
<TE>   James Borbon, a senior lineman, recalls league rival Garden Grove
Pacifica trouncing the Matadors when he was a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never going to feel good when you lose 66-0," he said at a
practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   Borbon many times has been tempted to quit the team -- scores of
players have over the years -- but something keeps bringing him back
to practice. Together, Borbon and his teammates keep moving forward,
week after week, approaching each new opponent as an opportunity to
wipe the slate clean.</TE>
<TE>   Until Friday, the season had gone much the same way at La Quinta,
which is located about 2 1/2 miles from Bolsa Grande. The Aztecs
could have filled a blooper video with their blunders in the first
eight games, yet when the players look back on the season they feel a
certain sense of accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was about winning and losing I would have quit a long time
ago," senior Rawaha Memon, a center and linebacker, said at a
practice this week. "I'm still here because I want to play football.
I have a lot of pride in being on this team. I don't care about our
record. I just care about playing with these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams have one more game. La Quinta will meet Garden Grove
Pacifica this Friday, the same night Bolsa Grande closes out against
Fountain Valley Los Amigos -- a last chance at glory for seniors like
Jesus Jimenez, a wide receiver and defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to get that first win before we graduate," said
Jimenez, who has never experienced a varsity victory.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bolsa Grande's seniors were on the freshman team when the
Matadors last won a varsity game, 18-0, over La Quinta on Oct. 18,
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Jefferson, a senior tight end and defensive end,
remembers the atmosphere surrounding that victory, which snapped a
21-game losing streak. "It was like we won the Super Bowl," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At both schools, football players are stung by the pointed
comments of classmates. Among the most common: "When are you guys
going to win?" and "Nobody comes to your games because you don't
win."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jimenez: "I just tell them they're not out here, they're not
playing, so what do they know?"</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta's recent football history hasn't been quite as grim. The
Aztecs won their season finale last year and came close twice earlier
this season.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta would have beaten Buena Park ... had it not been stopped
at the one-yard line on the last play of the game. The Aztecs lost,
32-28.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta might have beaten Garden Grove Santiago ... if tight end
Henri Nguyen's third-quarter catch in the end zone hadn't been ruled
a fumble. The Aztecs lost, 28-21, even though coaches argued that if
Nguyen had fumbled the ball in the end zone he would have first had
to have possession for the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very emotional," Nguyen recalled. "We had to pick each
other up and go on to the next play."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, La Quinta had been without Gardner, who had taken
leave to be with his terminally ill father. Assistant Mike Barton
assumed coaching duties for the game last week against Santiago.
Gardner's father died Wednesday and he rejoined the Aztecs on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta Athletic Director Jim Perry, who helps tape the football
players before practice, said the team has somehow managed to remain
enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard a single negative statement about, 'Oh, not
another day of practice,' or, 'I can hardly wait until this is over,'
" Perry said. "They're excited about being at practice. They're
talking about the game film, the scouting reports, how they're going
to play a certain individual. They're all really focused."</TE>
<TE>   At Bolsa Grande, Lamb and his assistants consider themselves
teachers above all else -- and it's a good thing. "You don't go 0-30
and not need to learn some football skills," Lamb said. "We've seen
some really silly mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   They've also seen some progress. Last week, in a 44-6 loss to
Pacifica, Bolsa Grande did not commit a turnover and sophomore
tailback Brian Sliwinski ripped off a 78-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta's Perry credits Gardner and his staff with instilling
more than football skills in their players.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not telling kids they're going to be college football
players," Perry said. "They're telling kids they're going to have a
great experience playing high school football. They're going to learn
to deal with some difficult situations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to prepare them to be great citizens down the line.
Unless I'm totally wrong, that's what high school athletics is
supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   For Memon, a center and linebacker for La Quinta, high school
football has been a lesson in perseverance -- a common bond he has
with the players from Bolsa Grande.</TE>
<TE>   "Our record doesn't say much about how we play and how hard we
hit," he said. "We still go out there and work hard and leave
everything on the field. Our record doesn't mean anything."</TE>

<LD>In case you missed it, NFL dynasties are dead.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to free agency and a hard salary cap, repeat Super Bowl
champions apparently are a thing of the past and teams struggle
simply to win two games in a row in Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
parity league.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that the NFL still has inept teams like Cincinnati,
Dallas and Detroit, which have as much chance of reaching the
playoffs as Winona Ryder has of getting hired as a sales clerk on
Rodeo Drive.</LD>
<TE>   But even those teams will have opportunities to turn things around
sooner than later. Just check out the types of seasons St. Louis,
Baltimore and New England had before their Super Bowl championship
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Two months into this season, several teams have emerged as
legitimate Super Bowl contenders, with one of them the San Francisco
49ers, standing out in recent weeks, especially after an overtime
victory over Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Mariucci and offensive coordinator Greg Knapp have put
together a versatile attack, which has the league's best mixture of
run and pass.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making progress on offense," said Mariucci, whose 49ers
have won five of their last six games and host Kansas City on Sunday.
"We're becoming more explosive."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jeff Garcia may not have the strongest arm, nor is he
the league's most accurate passer, but he gets the job done and
seldom makes the same mistake twice.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers can count on Garcia to make the right decision to keep
drives alive. He consistently hurt the Raiders with short runs out of
the pocket when the 49ers needed first downs.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the season, Garcia struggled against the NFL's
most common defense, the two-deep zone with safeties lining up on the
hash marks. He doesn't have that problem anymore.</TE>
<TE>   By spreading the ball around to other receivers, instead of
looking for No. 1 threat Terrell Owens, Garcia has taken the 49er
offense to a new level. He leads the NFL with a 134.7 third-down
passing rating, and has thrown for 10 touchdowns with no
interceptions in 69 third-down passes.</TE>
<TE>   Owens still gets his share of passes -- just ask Oakland
cornerback Charles Woodson, who watched Owens make 12 receptions for
191 yards. But so do wideout Tai Streets, who's taken over for
underachiever J.J. Stokes, and Garrison Hearst, Kevan Barlow and Fred
Beasley out of the backfield.</TE>
<TE>   But what sets the 49ers apart is their ability to run when they
want to run.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders often knew what was coming, but they couldn't stop San
Francisco from running 51 plays in the second half and overtime,
including the final 30 of the game with most of the damage coming on
the ground. That's just how old championship teams such as
Pittsburgh, Miami, Washington and even the Raiders used to do it.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't the first time that San Francisco has done that this
season. Four times in six victories, the 49ers have run out the clock
while either driving for the winning points or protecting slim leads.</TE>
<TE>   Individually, neither Hearst nor Barlow is among the top 10 in
rushing but together, they form a dangerous 1-2 punch. Combined, they
have three fewer carries but 31 more yards than Kansas City's Priest
Holmes, who leads the league in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure each one of them would like to have more of the load,"
Garcia said. "But that's the way it is. We have two backs that are as
solid as they are and as talented as they are, and we need to get
them both on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Morris, the offensive line coach, has put together a unit
that, despite a season-ending knee injury to guard Dave Fiore, has
spearheaded the second-best rushing attack in the NFC and allowed
only nine sacks.</TE>
<TE>   With Derrick Deese, Ron Stone, Jeremy Newberry, Eric Heitmann and
Scott Gragg as the starters and Matt Willig as the top backup, the
49ers can blow teams off the ball when they need yards on the ground,
and protect Garcia when they need a completion.</TE>
<TE>   Beasley, the fullback, is the X-factor. Not only is he the lead
blocker for Hearst and Barlow, but he also protects Garcia from
blitzing linebackers and safeties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the business," Beasley said. "You don't get all the
touchdowns and make all the runs, but you're doing the dirty work,
like an extra lineman."</TE>
<TE>   But Beasley can also run with the ball on short-yardage plays, and
he did that extremely well against the Raiders. Last Sunday, he
finished with five carries -- three on third and one, one on second
and one, and a critical one on fourth and one in overtime -- and he
converted all into first downs.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a way to keep drives alive late in games was a priority
for the 49ers coming into the season. In a key game last season, St.
Louis defeated San Francisco with a crucial seven-minute drive to end
the game after the 49ers had cut the Rams' lead to 30-26. The loss
ended up costing the 49ers home-field advantage for the first round
of the playoffs and they lost at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Closing the game with five-, six-, seven-, eight-minute drives is
huge," Mariucci said. "You're saying to that offense over there, with
a Marshall Faulk or Rich Gannon or Jerry Rice, whatever weapons they
may have: 'Keep off the field.' That's very frustrating for them."</TE>
<TE>   After playing the Chiefs this weekend, San Francisco plays two
more quality teams, San Diego and Philadelphia. If the secondary
stops giving up so many third-down conversions -- opponents have a
53.8% success rate -- they may win enough games to earn precious
home-field advantage in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the 49ers end up playing postseason games at Green Bay
or Philadelphia in December, they'll still have a chance because of
Garcia and their ground attack.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- "Now comes the hard part," President Bush said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spent little time
savoring their 15-0 diplomatic victory in the U.N. Security Council
before turning to the difficult task that lies ahead: holding a
fragile new coalition together to demand full cooperation from Iraq
on weapons inspections -- and, if Iraq resists, to go to war.</LD>
<LD>   When Bush spoke in the White House Rose Garden on Friday morning,
his words were aimed not only at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but
also at his own reluctant allies, from France and Germany to Turkey
and some in the Arab world.</LD>
<TE>   "The United Nations Security Council has ... given clear and fair
notice that Saddam Hussein must fully disclose and destroy his
weapons of mass destruction," Bush said. "Now the world must insist
that that judgment be enforced."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few weeks, U.S. officials said, Bush and his aides
will be pressing the offensive against Iraq on three fronts: pushing
for an early test of Baghdad's compliance with the U.N. resolution,
maintaining the newly won international consensus that Iraq must
comply, and all the while preparing -- as noisily as possible -- for
a war that the administration still believes is likely to come.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be keeping the pressure on. We're going to be
keeping the bar high ... and bucking everybody up so Saddam can't get
away with noncompliance," a senior official said. "And we're going to
continue military preparations."</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the Security Council vote, Bush and Powell were
sending messages to foreign capitals laying out a deliberately
stringent view of what Iraq must do to avert a military attack. Not
only must Baghdad admit U.N. arms inspectors and turn over a complete
inventory of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, they said, but
it must allow the inspectors free and immediate access to any person
or place they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's "cooperation must be prompt and unconditional or he will
face the severest consequences," Bush said. "Any act of delay or
defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq's international
obligations."</TE>
<TE>   The first tests will come quickly. The resolution demands that
Iraq formally agree to its provisions within seven days and provide a
full accounting of its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
programs within 30 days. An advance party of U.N. inspectors will be
on the ground in Baghdad by Nov. 18, with a deadline to begin their
inspections within 45 days from now.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the administration has come up with several gambits to
try to force Iraq into an early, clear test of its intentions. -- a
strategy known as "front-loading." U.S. intelligence agencies have
compiled estimates of Iraq's weaponry to check against the list that
Baghdad must submit in 30 days--and, potentially, to catch Hussein in
a lie.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have prepared a list of highly sensitive targets
for the U.N. inspectors to tackle first. And the administration has
urged chief inspector Hans Blix to focus his initial efforts on
asking Iraq for as much detailed information as possible -- a test
Washington believes will avoid the time-consuming process of sending
inspectors around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important factor is Iraqi behavior," one official said.
"That's one of the reasons we've put so much emphasis on transfers of
information.... Iraq's a big country. There are too many facilities,
too many trucks, too much sand to look under. So access to
information and access to people become key."</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq fails to comply with any U.N. request the administration
and its allies must then decide how to respond. The Security Council
may or may not decide to act, but Bush made it clear that he reserves
the right to act independently of the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   One official said the U.S. will enforce a "zero tolerance" policy
toward Iraqi violations. Others say it will decide on a case-by-case
basis whether any violations constitute "a pattern of noncompliance."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is not poised looking for the first comma out
of place," one senior official said. At the same time, he warned,
"we're not going to sit back and wait until we see day after day,
week after week of violations. I think it'll become clear early on
whether or not Iraq tends to cooperate ... and we will take evidence
of failure to cooperate, unwillingness to cooperate, right to the
council."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks Friday, Bush sounded like a member of the "zero
tolerance" camp:</TE>
<TE>   "With the passage of this resolution, the world must not lapse
into unproductive debates over whether specific instances of Iraqi
noncompliance are serious. Any Iraqi noncompliance is serious,
because such bad faith will show that Iraq has no intention of
disarming."</TE>
<TE>   The distinction could turn out to be critical as the
administration tries to hold its anti-Iraq alliance together. Bush
went to the U.N. in the first place, officials said, largely because
he did not relish the prospect of fighting a war without allies. Now,
if Iraq violates the rules, the U.S. must still convince its allies
that the infraction is serious enough to justify military force.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials said, they believe that the agonizing
negotiations of the last eight weeks -- far longer than they
anticipated in September -- have made France, Turkey and other
important allies much more willing to consider going to war.</TE>
<TE>   "We've crossed a certain Rubicon," one official said. "Everybody
reached a consensus on extremely demanding inspections.
Intellectually and politically, I think a lot of the world
understands where that takes you."</TE>
<TE>   To war? "If need be."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he said, nearly everyone -- including top U.N.
officials -- agrees that the United States and others should continue
preparing for war with Iraq, as visibly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "You do that in part to increase the chance that diplomacy will
work, and it's your fallback in case it doesn't," he said. "You don't
want to be in a situation where a diplomatic approach is tried and
found wanting and you find that you have to spend months and months
waiting to storm up the hill."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials took pains Friday to emphasize that
Powell and his negotiators did not give away any of Bush's freedom of
action in order to win the U.N. resolution, a key concern of
Republican hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "No handcuffs," one official said, using the administration's
shorthand.</TE>
<TE>   And if Hussein should surprise them and comply fully with the U.N.
resolutions on disarmament, can he keep his job?</TE>
<TE>   Not likely, senior officials said. For one thing, the U.S. still
intends to pursue the Iraqi leader on war crimes charges.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other U.N. resolutions, and those deal with things like
his crimes against his own people, his crimes against his neighbors,
his use in the past of weapons of mass destruction," one senior
official said. "If the Iraqi regime did everything that it needed to
do to comply with all of the U.N. resolutions, it would be a changed
regime. There is no doubt that you would not have that regime, under
these circumstances, in place. But regime change remains the policy
of the United States."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. Special Forces troops shot and killed a gunman who fired on them
near the central Afghan town of Deh Rawod, a U.S. military spokesman
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The forces were helping an Afghan police officer who had been
fired on Thursday in the province of Oruzgan when two attackers in
civilian clothing opened fire on the U.S. forces with AK-47 assault
rifles, spokesman Col. Roger King said. The soldiers returned fire,
killing one man. The other escaped.</LD>
<LD>   King said the dead man's identity was not yet known.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, eight people fired on U.S. Special Forces troops about
two miles north of Khowst, in eastern Afghanistan. AH-64 Apache
attack helicopters fired rockets and 30-millimeter rounds before the
eight fled.</TE>
<TE>   There were no U.S. casualties in either incident.</TE>
<TE>   Paratroops swept through four areas near Khowst on Thursday and
Friday morning, seizing weapons including 28 mines, 76 hand grenades,
147 rocket-launched grenades, 62 launchers, more than 500
5.62-millimeter rounds and 12 107-millimeter rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Five men were taken to Khowst for questioning, King said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, American attack helicopters were circling the skies
over Khowst after unidentified attackers fired four rockets toward
the U.S. base there, an Afghan government official in Khowst said on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how close the rockets came to the Khowst airfield,
and there were no reports of casualties.</TE>

<HD>Bali Blast Allegedly Targeted Americans</HD>
<DH>The chief investigator says an accomplice told of
disappointment that so few from U.S. died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SURABAYA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The attackers who planned the Oct. 12 car bombing in Bali hoped to
kill a large number of Americans and were disappointed that the main
foreign victims were Australians, the head of the investigation said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Based on what he said was the confession of a suspect who has
admitted helping place the bomb, Police Maj. Gen. Made M. Pastika
said the attackers were seeking revenge for perceived injustices
suffered by Muslims at the hands of Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The bomb, which was in a minivan outside two popular nightclubs,
exploded on a Saturday night, killing at least 191 people. Most of
them were Indonesians and Australians. Six Americans were among the
dead.</LD>
<TE>   "They said they want to kill ... Americans, so they tried to find
where the Americans were gathering. That is in Bali," Pastika told
reporters during a trip to Manila. "But they were not that happy
because Australians were killed in big numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four weeks after the bombing, evidence is mounting that the
attack was carried out by Muslim extremists connected with Jemaah
Islamiah, a Southeast Asian terror network that has ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect arrested this week, an Indonesian identified only as
Amrozi, has admitted knowing three key figures in Jemaah Islamiah,
police say, although the extent of the relationships is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi, the owner of the minivan, reportedly said he knew Abu
Bakar Bashir, the reputed head of Jemaah Islamiah, who has been
detained by police in connection with earlier terror bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi also has admitted knowing the region's most wanted
terrorist, a cleric named Riduan Isamuddin, who goes by the name
Hambali, a police official said. Hambali is believed to be the
regional operations director for Jemaah Islamiah and to be a
prominent member of Al Qaeda. Authorities say he has played a role in
nearly every major terror attack in the region in the last eight
years and is believed to have helped organize the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Pastika said Amrozi has acknowledged knowing Fathur
Rohman Al-Ghozi, a Jemaah Islamiah bomb maker who was arrested in the
Philippines and who has admitted his role in Manila bombings that
killed 22 people in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say Amrozi's passport shows that he traveled to
Malaysia and Thailand, although it is not clear when.</TE>
<TE>   He bought the van that was used in the bombing with Singaporean
dollars and Malaysian ringgit. "That indicates this has a link with
Malaysia, Singapore and other countries in Southeast Asia," Pastika
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pastika said six to 10 people carried out the Bali attack and that
police were closing in on the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the names already, he said. "We know their identity. Now
all the police are doing is searching [for] them throughout the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Pastika said Amrozi bought a ton of chemicals with which to make
bombs, including ammonium chlorate, aluminum powder and sulfur.</TE>
<TE>   Police estimate that the Bali bomb weighed about 200 pounds,
leaving the other 1,800 pounds of chemicals unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it will be used for another bomb," Pastika said.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi reportedly told police that he began building the car bomb
about a week before the attack. Its construction would have required
two people, Pastika said.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi told police how to find the house in Bali where the bomb
was made, Pastika said. Investigators found explosives residue inside
the house, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they also found two one-way airline tickets to the
northern Indonesian city of Manado. The tickets were reportedly for
travel on Nov. 7, two days after Amrozi was arrested.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following are excerpts of President Bush's remarks after the U.N.
Security Council vote:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   With the resolution just passed, the United Nations Security
Council has met important responsibilities, upheld its principles and
given clear and fair notice that Saddam Hussein must fully disclose
and destroy his weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   He must submit to any and all methods to verify his compliance.
His cooperation must be prompt and unconditional, or he will face the
severest consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The world has now come together to say that the outlaw regime in
Iraq will not be permitted to build or possess chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   That is the judgment of the United States Congress. That is the
judgment of the United Nations Security Council. Now that world must
insist that that judgment be enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's obligation to disarm is not new, or even recent. To end the
Persian Gulf War and ensure its own survival, Iraq's regime agreed to
disarm in April of 1991. For over a decade, the Iraqi regime has
treated its own pledge with contempt.</TE>
<TE>   As today's resolution states, Iraq is already in material breach
of past U.N. demands. Iraq has aggressively pursued weapons of mass
destruction, even while inspectors were inside the country. Iraq has
undermined the effectiveness of weapons inspectors with ploys, delays
and threats, making their work impossible and leading to four years
of no inspections....</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors do not have the power to disarm an unwilling regime.
They can only confirm that a government has decided to disarm itself.
History has shown that when Iraq's leaders stall inspections and
impede the progress, it means they have something to hide.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution approved today presents the Iraqi regime with a
test, a final test. Iraq must now, without delay or negotiations,
fully disarm, welcome full inspections and fundamentally change the
approach it has taken for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The regime must allow immediate and unrestricted access to every
site, every document and every person identified by inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq can be certain that the old game of cheat and retreat,
tolerated at other times, will no longer be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of
Iraq's international obligations and a clear signal that the Iraqi
regime has once again abandoned the path of voluntary compliance....</TE>
<TE>   If we are to avert war, all nations must continue to pressure
Saddam Hussein to accept this resolution and to comply with its
obligations, and his obligation.</TE>
<TE>   America will be making only one determination:</TE>
<TE>   Is Iraq meeting the terms of the Security Council resolution or
not?</TE>
<TE>   The United States has agreed to discuss any material breach with
the Security Council, but without jeopardizing our freedom of action
to defend our country.</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq fails to fully comply, the United States and other nations
will disarm Saddam Hussein....</TE>
<TE>   Americans recognize what is at stake. In fighting a war on terror,
we are determined to oppose every source of catastrophic harm that
threatens our country, our friends and our allies.</TE>
<TE>   We are actively pursuing dangerous terror networks across the
world. And we oppose a uniquely dangerous regime -- a regime that has
harbored terrorists and could supply terrorists with weapons of mass
destruction, a regime that has built such terrible weapons and has
used them to kill thousands, a brutal regime with a history of both
reckless ambition and reckless miscalculation....</TE>
<TE>   In confronting this threat, America seeks the support of the
world. If action becomes necessary, we will act in the interests of
the world. And America expects Iraqi compliance with all U.N.
resolutions. The time has come for the Iraqi people to escape
oppression, find freedom and live in hope....</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the hard part. The Security Council must maintain its
unity and sense of purpose, so that the Iraqi regime cannot revert to
the strategies of obstruction and deception it used so successfully
in the past. The outcome of the current crisis is already determined:
The full disarmament of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq will
occur. The only question for the Iraqi regime is to decide how.</TE>
<TE>   The United States prefers that Iraq meet its obligations
voluntarily, yet we are prepared for the alternative. In either case,
the just demands of the world will be met.</TE>

<HD>Security Council Mandate Echoes Resolution Past</HD>

<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>On a chilly November day, the U.N. Security Council gathered with
full pomp and solemnity to read Saddam Hussein the riot act.</LD>
<LD>   It offered the Iraqi president "one last sincere chance to give
common sense a chance to work, or, if you will, for the instinct of
self-preservation to come into play," a diplomat said.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomat stood outside the Security Council chamber in front
of a huge Picasso tapestry depicting the horrors of war and warned
that this was no time for Hussein to try to save face. "He now has to
save his people, his country," the diplomat said. "He has to save the
world. He has to save peace in the region and global peace."</LD>
<TE>   The date was Nov. 29, 1990. The diplomat was Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, the last Soviet foreign minister. The resolution gave
Iraq until Jan. 15, 1991, to pull its troops out of Kuwait or face
war.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years, one war and 16 Security Council resolutions later,
reminders of that day echoed through the proceedings Friday, when by
a unanimous vote the council gave Iraq "a final opportunity" to
comply with U.N. demands or face unspecified "serious consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the past, ambassador after ambassador walked out into
the hall Friday where Picasso's tormented "Guernica" mural replica
still hangs. One by one, they delivered well-scripted talking points
intended to convince Hussein that he could avoid another war by
finally surrendering any weapons of mass destruction, while at the
same time conveying that this time, they really, really mean it.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic dress code being what it is, only the ambassadors'
faces seem to have changed -- not their ties. The cavernous glass
U.N. building, with its early-1950s architecture and furnishings that
appear of similar vintage, also feels like a time capsule.</TE>
<TE>   Yet geopolitics -- and the politics of the diplomatic battle
inside the U.N. -- have changed dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the resolution explicitly authorized the use of military
force for only the second time in the world body's history, the first
being the start of the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was 12 to 2, and the Soviet Union, in the flowering of
its fatal reform period, joined the United States, France, Britain,
Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Finland, Romania, Malaysia
and Zaire in approving the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba and Yemen, the only Arab nation then on the council, voted
against it. China abstained.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the vote was a unanimous 15 to 0. The hardest sells
were Syria, Russia, China, Mexico and France, all of which wanted to
ensure that the U.N. resolution was not used by the U.S. as a pretext
to strike Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Deputy Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yishan, whose
debonair bearing and idiomatic English contrasted sharply with the
frumpy suits and Chinese-language tirades of his counterparts of a
decade ago, asserted that China had played a role in forging the
international consensus.</TE>
<TE>   China remains opposed to the use of force against Iraq, and, ever
wary of Western encroachment on its own sovereignty, demanded the
insertion of language respecting Iraqi sovereignty. China also called
on the United Nations to suspend and eventually lift sanctions
against Iraq if Hussein complies with the disarmament resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats on Friday stressed the importance of the unanimous vote
in sending a strong message of international determination that
represents the last hope of persuading Hussein to disarm.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's resolution, however, is significantly weaker than the
1990 document, which took just 10 paragraphs to authorize "all
necessary means" to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Friday's
document runs 10 pages of intricately worded legalese, including a
four-page annex, and it spells out a two-step approach that would
require the Security Council to convene again to discuss how to
handle any Iraqi defiance.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990 resolution came about after a whirlwind of diplomacy by
then-Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who lobbied fellow
ministers up to the doors of the council chambers. True to tradition,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell didn't know until Friday morning
that Russia would support the resolution, and he learned that Syria
would make the vote unanimous when U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte
placed a cell phone call to Powell as Negroponte was walking into the
chambers about 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's vote, ambassadors from several countries made it
clear they expect the Bush administration to obtain a separate
authorization from the Security Council before any military action is
taken against Iraq. U.S. officials made it equally clear they do not
intend to be hamstrung.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has been offered a rigorous and fair way forward," Irish
Ambassador Richard Ryan said. "What is most important is that the
resolution deflects the threat of war."</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush, in a news conference a day earlier, promised
that this 17th resolution seeking Iraqi disarmament would be
enforced, by military means if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "This time we mean it. See, that's the difference -- I guess,"
Bush said. "This time it's for real. And I say it must not have been
for real the last 16 times, because nothing happened when he didn't
[disarm].</TE>
<TE>   "This time something happens."</TE>

<HD>A Life Saved Only to Be Lost</HD>
<DH>A Palestinian boy's heart condition was improving, thanks
to two Israeli doctors. But there was no remedy for their world's
violence.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>RAFAH REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>Israeli doctor Akiva Tamir still speaks of his young Palestinian
patient as though the boy had lived.</LD>
<LD>   Tamir and a team of cardiologists, surgeons and other specialists
worked repeatedly in recent years to cure the illness that weakened
Mohammed abu Hilal's heart. In May, the most successful operation yet
restored Mohammed's vitality. He gained weight, grew and was playing
soccer with new energy.</LD>
<LD>   On Oct. 17, Israeli soldiers shot Mohammed dead. It was a day when
half a dozen Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli troops who
patrol the edge of this wretched refugee camp in southernmost Gaza;
it started as a firefight with Palestinian gunmen but ended with
Israeli tanks firing several rounds into the densely populated warren
of concrete-and-tin shacks.</LD>
<TE>   Mohammed, the first to die, was killed as he walked home from his
uncle's house. He was 15.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Mohammed and his doctors illustrates how closely
Palestinians and Israelis cooperated before their societies were
driven apart -- perhaps irreparably -- by the destruction and hatred
of the deadliest fighting in a generation. Israelis and Palestinians
today are more likely to kill than to heal each other; both sides
have been hardened, their societies devastated. Any common ground has
been soaked in blood.</TE>
<TE>   The news of Mohammed's death hit Tamir and his partner, Zion
Houri, hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Stupid, stupid, stupid," Houri said. Such a waste, agreed Tamir.</TE>
<TE>   Tamir and Houri work out of the Wolfson Medical Center in the Tel
Aviv suburb of Holon. Mohammed was ferried 55 miles from Rafah to
Holon dozens of times for treatments and for three operations in
three years. Each trip was an ordeal: acquiring hard-to-get permits,
crossing checkpoints and transferring from one (Palestinian)
ambulance to another (Israeli).</TE>
<TE>   Leafing through Mohammed's file, Tamir reviewed his handwritten
notes and remembered the first time he treated the boy. Progressive
heart failure. Huffing and puffing. Unable to walk easily. A
heartbeat nearly twice the normal rate.</TE>
<TE>   He described Mohammed's condition in the present tense -- until
reminded that the boy was dead. He seemed truly distraught.</TE>
<TE>   "All our lives what we do is try to make people feel better and
give them a future," Tamir said, shaking his head. "I cannot imagine
this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Mohammed came home the last time from Israel, he seemed so
much better.</TE>
<TE>   "His health was such that I never used to think he would get any
taller," recalled his mother, Inshirah. "But he was getting fatter
and taller. He was becoming a man."</TE>
<TE>   His father, Sami, began contemplating a marriage for him. After
losing four of their nine children to disease, they finally came to
believe that Mohammed, their eldest, would make it.</TE>
<TE>   From his sickly years, Mohammed was a homebody. He loved to make
decorations from plastic flowers and fiddle with the family aquarium
and draw pictures. Now he was playing a little soccer and
volunteering to help his uncle build a house. He wanted a computer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big change," his father said. "We had always thought he
would die at any moment."</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Hilals live in a rented four-room house at the end of a
network of narrow, winding alleyways in the so-called Block O of the
Rafah refugee camp. They had to sell the home they owned, plus their
small textile factory, to pay medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   Rafah has long been one of the deadliest and most miserable
corners of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It has been transformed
into a nightmarish urban battlefield, where Palestinian guerrillas
routinely fire grenades and guns at Israeli troops patrolling the
border with Egypt, and troops routinely demolish Palestinian homes,
raze orchards and shell neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Mohammed's mother traveled to Saudi Arabia in a
religious pilgrimage that she had promised God to make if her son
survived.</TE>
<TE>   She never saw him again. He was killed while she was away and
buried before she could return. She had always thought that if
something happened to one of her children, it would be 13-year-old
Ahmed. He loved to go out and taunt the troops. Not Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   It was about 2:30 in the afternoon that day, and Mohammed, a lanky
boy with the first trace of an adolescent mustache, had finished
school. He was walking home the 100 yards or so from his uncle's
house when the shooting started.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was shot by a large-caliber round from a tank-mounted
machine gun, witnesses said. In the next couple of hours, tank shells
hit the pavement in front of a boys school and a corner grocery
store, killing the shopkeeper and his customer. The dead also
included 8-year-old Shamya abu Shamalah, who had stayed home from the
mosque that day because her parents thought that the streets might be
dangerous. She was killed fleeing her bed as shrapnel pierced the
thin walls of her home.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army does not dispute the details of what happened in
Rafah and said it regretted the loss of civilian life, but it
insisted that its forces -- including a 60-ton Merkava tank and an
armored bulldozer -- had come under fire. October was a month in
which Israeli forces killed about 30 civilians, many of them
children, according to Israeli human rights organizations, during an
open-ended reoccupation of most of the West Bank and parts of Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli commander overseeing operations in Rafah, Brig. Gen.
Yisrael Ziv, this week acknowledged that the army used "exaggerated
force" on Oct. 17. "The tank fired four shells, when one was enough,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cooperation in the medical field was once one of the hallmarks of
a slowly normalizing relationship between Israel and the
Palestinians. From 1994, when the self-rule Palestinian Authority was
established, until 1998, an estimated 4,000 people were involved in
148 cooperative health projects, and new projects were being launched
every year.</TE>
<TE>   Little of that is left. All official contact between the
Palestinian and Israeli health ministries has ceased. And though the
occasional incident in which Israeli medics treat Palestinian
terrorists gets wide attention, the reality is that only a handful of
private, virtually underground shared efforts continue.</TE>
<TE>   Grim health statistics reflect that reality: Nearly three-quarters
of Palestinian children now suffer from some form of malnutrition or
anemia; kidney dialysis patients are dying because of lack of
treatment; diseases such as hepatitis, meningitis and tuberculosis
are reported to be on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Tamir and Houri are part of a program called Save a Child's Heart.
In six years they and their associates have cared for 800 children,
most of them non-Israelis. A quarter of them have been Palestinians.
On any given day, the intensive care ward might include children from
as far away as Tanzania and Eritrea.</TE>
<TE>   Although they still treat some Palestinian children, the doctors
have found it easier in the last two years to find partners to work
with in distant Congo or Mauritania. Palestinian doctors have become
reluctant to seek their assistance, Tamir and Houri said. Somehow
it's seen as consorting with the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Gray-haired, bespectacled Tamir, 51, is a quintessential Israeli,
a "sabra" -- Israeli-born with Israeli parents. His dark-haired
partner Houri, 48, is a Tunisian-born Jew who immigrated to Israel at
the age of 16. Both completed military service and did reserve duty.
Both, like most Israelis, have felt their political leanings shoved
decidedly to the right in the last two years of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Houri, especially, was a regular supporter of the leftist Meretz
Party. But last year he voted for right-wing hawk Ariel Sharon. So
did Tamir.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like Sharon," Tamir said of the prime minister. He
believed that Sharon's predecessor, Ehud Barak, was sincere in
attempting to end the conflict. Once Barak failed, Tamir decided that
the Palestinians were not serious about making peace and the conflict
became a "war for the homeland" best led by Sharon, Tamir said.</TE>
<TE>   Houri, who completed some of his studies at UCLA, can use the
remnants of his native Arabic to speak to his Palestinian patients,
although it is a Tunisian dialect peppered with French and the jargon
of his Tunisian Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers trail him, asking when their child will be well, when will
he sit up or stand.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that helping children is the sane thing to do," Houri
said. "Maybe it brings a little sanity, an island of sanity, to an
insane situation."</TE>
<TE>   Houri says they try to keep politics out of the hospital, but that
is next to impossible. On one level, everyone maintains an informal
professionalism that is typical for Israel. But tension festers just
below the surface, expressed primarily in comments made by nurses or
parents in the corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Houri remembers a suicide bomber's attack on a crowded Tel Aviv
cafe five years ago. A father of one of his Palestinian patients
applauded the news as it came over TV sets in the hospital waiting
room. The mother of one of the Jewish victims worked in radiology.</TE>
<TE>   "We gain our power from curing people," said Tamir, whose office
walls are decorated with the photos of patients. "Some people gain
power from sending their children to bomb other children. There's a
lot of hatred out there. We try to go in the other direction and gain
power from curing people."</TE>
<TE>   Both Houri and Tamir support what they see as their government's
war on terrorism, in defense of Jewish lives and well-being, to make
Israeli streets safe again. But their views are sculpted by nuance.</TE>
<TE>   Tamir is anguished that his son, a soldier, has pulled
Palestinians out of their homes in the middle of the night for
interrogation and arrest. There has to be a "cleaner" way to fight
this battle, he says. But his family, including his soldier-son, says
he's being unrealistic, "a dreamer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Days after his son's death, Sami abu Hilal and some of his other
boys, male relatives and neighbors are seated in plastic chairs
outside the home.</TE>
<TE>   When he is asked about the Israeli doctors, Abu Hilal touches his
heart in a gesture of respect. He remembers that they always treated
him well.</TE>
<TE>   But then, bitterness takes over. The question on his mind is
whether the same doctors who saved his son would also take up guns
against Palestinians as part of their military service. He is sure
that they would.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled the moments after the most recent surgery ended in
success. The doctor placed his hand on Abu Hilal's shoulder. "Tell
your son that a Jew did this," the doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   A grateful Abu Hilal, somewhat hyperbolically, told the doctor:
"If my son ever throws stones at your people, I will cut off his
hands."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment evaporated with the smoke, thuds and crackle of the
tank fire that claimed Mohammed's life.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Hilal says he'd rather send his other children to "the worst
doctor in Palestine" than return to the Jews, if this is how things
end. "I want revenge."</TE>

<HD>A Machine Mean Enough for Mines</HD>
<DH>The armor-plated Flailer enables U.S. troops to safely
uncover and detonate deadly devices lodged in the Afghan landscape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Zucchino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Spc. 4 Jacob "Skip" Phillips was at the controls and Staff Sgt.
Michael Lewis was in the command seat when their vehicle ran over an
antitank mine.</LD>
<LD>   Both National Guard soldiers were lifted off their seats by the
force of the blast, which rattled windows for miles. The vehicle
shuddered and rocked. Phillips and Lewis gathered themselves together
and looked outside at a towering plume of black smoke.</LD>
<LD>   "What a rush!" Phillips said. "Really gets your blood going."</LD>
<TE>   Deliberately detonating land mines is all in a day's work for the
crew of the Flailer, an ugly, armor-plated vehicle designed to
uncover mines. The U.S. military leases three of the massive machines
here at Bagram, a former Soviet air base planted with thousands of
mines and littered with tons of unexploded ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   For eight hours a day, six days a week, the crews crawl across the
desert floor inside the 18-ton-plus Flailer, hoping to unearth mines.
Safe inside the armored cab behind 3-inch-thick windows, they brace
themselves for each new detonation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never be ready for them, it just happens -- boom!" Lewis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officially known as a Hydrema 910 MCV (Mine Clearing Vehicle), the
Flailer has a heavy steel plate and a huge metal cylinder studded
with 72 heavy chains mounted on its rear. Weighted on the ends, the
spinning chains tear into the packed desert sand and clay as the
vehicle backs up, sending up enormous clouds of white dust and grit.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking over operation of the Flailers from Norwegian
soldiers four months ago, U.S. troops have not suffered a
mine-related casualty. Before that, more than a dozen American
soldiers were injured while clearing mines on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Since coalition mine-clearing efforts began late last year, about
8,000 mines at this base have been cleared, with an estimated 14,000
remaining. Bagram is one of the most densely mined areas in a nation
that is among the three most heavily mined in the world, along with
Cambodia and Angola.</TE>
<TE>   The work is dirty, hazardous and unnerving. Between them, Lewis
and Phillips have detonated nearly 300 antipersonnel mines and 20
antitank mines.</TE>
<TE>   "If my wife knew what I was doing, she'd kill me," Lewis said.
"She thinks I'm doing engineering work."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis spoke as Phillips manipulated a computerized control console
to lower the steel blast shield and send the chains spinning. Digging
4 to 8 inches down, the chains sent pebbles and rocks smashing into
the armored cab and windows, leaving spider-web abrasions in the
thick glass as the Flailer lumbered along.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, the vehicle commander, was worried about the dust, which
blanketed the windshield. Polish sappers had warned him about a
200-pound bomb they had found at the edge of the dirt track the
vehicle was clearing. The bomb had been spray-painted orange, but
that didn't help Lewis because he couldn't see a thing through the
dust storm.</TE>
<TE>   The Flailer is designed to absorb the blast of a land mine or tank
mine -- anything that has up to 22 pounds of explosives -- although
crews say they've survived blasts from up to 30 pounds. A 200-pound
bomb would, as Lewis put it, "lay waste to this machine and kill
everything inside, meaning us."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis ordered Phillips several times to stop the vehicle so he
could radio a fellow soldier in an observation tower to get his
bearings. Over the radio, Sgt. John Fairchild kept assuring him that
the bomb still lay more than 50 yards ahead on the right side of the
track.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis looked at Phillips and said, "We will definitely stay to the
left."</TE>
<TE>   Then Lewis shrugged and spoke into the radio: "Sapper One to base.
Ready to start flailing."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips sent the chains flying again. Within minutes, they had
detonated the antitank mine. It turned out to be an American-made
M-15, probably one supplied to Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet
occupation forces in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   After the dust had cleared, Lewis steered the Flailer back to the
observation tower to inspect the vehicle. Each Flailer is leased for
$56,000 a month, so soldiers pay close attention to damage. The blast
had blackened and pocked the cylinder and severed one of the chains,
flinging it more than 200 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis grabbed a wrench and replaced the chain. Then he and
Phillips climbed back into the cab and rumbled down the dirt track in
search of more mines.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, Phillips and the other Flailer crew members are not trained
as sappers. They are engineers, sent to Bagram on roughly six-month
tours with their National Guard unit, the 769th Engineers Battalion
from Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram, de-mining is an international effort. The Americans are
trained by Norwegian soldiers to operate the Flailer, built by a
Danish company and maintained until recently by a Danish engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Before each mission, the areas to be de-mined are first inspected
on foot by a team of Polish army sappers working out of a van with
the words "Polish Saperski" painted on the sides.</TE>
<TE>   It's draining, unglamorous work carried out at the remote edges of
the air base, far from fellow soldiers going about their daily
routines. Lewis and Phillips say they don't mind keeping a low
profile. Like all Flailer crew members, they volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, 23, a college student at Louisiana State University,
said he volunteered to "do something positive, you know, make a
difference." Of course, he didn't tell his mother. She thinks that
he's repairing vehicles. He said he'll probably tell her when he
returns home.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I get to go back and tell them at school I blow up land
mines," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 44, said he won't tell his wife and daughters about his
mission until he gets back home to Gonzales, La. For now, he's
satisfied with clearing Bagram one mine at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about it because we're doing something important," he
said, leaning against the Flailer. "Every mine we blow up, that's
somebody's life we're saving."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Friday took a telephone call from Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, their first direct contact since the German
leader's strong criticism of U.S. policy on Iraq severely strained
relations between the men.</LD>
<LD>   Bush accepted Schroeder's congratulations on the U.N. Security
Council's passage of a U.S.-backed resolution that probably will send
international weapons inspectors back into Iraq. The men talked for
about 10 minutes on other topics of mutual interest, including
Afghanistan, Turkey, North Atlantic Treaty Organization expansion and
the U.S.-declared war on terrorism, aides said.</LD>
<LD>   A German government spokesman in Berlin described the talks as
"constructive and trusting." A White House spokesman portrayed them
as more businesslike than warm.</LD>
<TE>   "The president's response ... is that he's getting down to
business, moving forward on common agenda items," said Sean McCormack
of the National Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Senior administration officials have said privately that the
quarrel has marked the lowest point in U.S.-German relations since
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has told officials he felt that Schroeder, who narrowly won
reelection in September, went back on a personal promise not to
attack American policy as a means of gaining an edge in that tight
campaign. The president has privately contrasted Schroeder's conduct
with that of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who is frank, even
if his messages are not always to the liking of U.S. officials,
according to Republican Party sources.</TE>
<TE>   German officials have contended that there were honest differences
over Iraq policy and stressed their desire to repair relations.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld met with German
Defense Minister Peter Struck, whom he snubbed at a September
gathering in Warsaw.</TE>
<TE>   Struck said before the Friday meeting that he wanted a "new start"
with the Americans.</TE>

<HD>Swiss to Assist Argentine Probe</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>Switzerland will help Argentina probe allegations that former
President Carlos Menem covered up an alleged Iranian role in a deadly
1994 bombing of a Jewish center, Swiss officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Argentina asked Switzerland in December 2001 to help investigate
claims that Menem took a $10-billion bribe to conceal alleged Iranian
links to the Buenos Aires car-bomb attack that killed 86 people.</LD>
<LD>   Menem, a candidate in presidential elections set for March, denies
the allegations. He has said he plans to sue the New York Times,
which originally published the allegations, and the former Iranian
intelligence agent the newspaper quoted as saying that Iran was
responsible for the bombing and had paid Menem to cover it up.</LD>
<TE>   Swiss authorities previously rejected Argentina's requests as
vague, but Geneva investigating Judge Christine Junod has now granted
judicial assistance. That means she can lift bank secrecy rules to
investigate and, if necessary, freeze accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Junod said: "Argentina has alleged that Menem received money to
orient the investigation in a certain way. I will now be able to
collect information, sort it and send on any pertinent details to
Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina is also investigating Menem and others in connection
with suspected illegal arms sales in the early 1990s to Croatia and
Ecuador, alleging that bribes went to Swiss bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Junod confirmed Friday that $10 million remained frozen in Swiss
accounts in connection with a related inquiry already underway in
Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts were frozen a year ago, but the judge has not yet
agreed to grant Argentina judicial cooperation in the matter.</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Police have arrested 12 people, including two schoolteachers, accused
of buying and selling children to couples who could not have their
own, a spokesman for the Mexico state attorney general's office said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they arrested six members of the alleged
child-smuggling gang Wednesday -- including the teachers at a school
just outside Mexico City -- and six on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   They also rescued a 6-year-old girl and a 1-month-old baby, both
of whom the gang planned to sell for a total of $10,000, prosecutors
said.</LD>
<TE>   "The majority of those arrested appeared to be tied to the
education system," said Jose Santos, a spokesman for the attorney
general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Santos said the 6-year-old girl's father was a high-ranking
official in the Mexican army, but he refused to give the child's

<HD>Calm Prevails in Jerusalem as Palestinians Observe Ramadan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An estimated 130,000 Palestinians flocked to Muslim prayers in
Jerusalem's Old City on the first Friday of the holy month of Ramadan
after Israel eased travel bans. No clashes were reported.</LD>
<LD>   Young Palestinian men from the West Bank have sometimes been
refused permission by Israeli authorities to attend prayers at Al
Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site. Friday prayers have been a
focus for violence directed at Israeli police and Jewish worshipers
preparing to usher in the Sabbath at the Western Wall, just below the
mosque compound.</LD>
<LD>   But on this day, the only unrest came in the form of a huge
traffic jam on the main road adjoining the walled Old City. About
2,000 police and paramilitary border police were called out in case
clashes erupted.</LD>
<TE>   At the Damascus Gate, the entry point to the Old City from
predominantly Arab East Jerusalem, long lines of men filed into the
cobblestoned alleyways leading to the Dome of the Rock complex, set
on a hilltop that is sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting and prayer, began Tuesday
evening. During the holiday, devout Muslims abstain from eating,
drinking and smoking during daylight hours, and Fridays, the most
important prayer day of the Muslim week, take on particular
importance.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to try to come here today to pray, even though I thought
I might be turned away," said Fayed Ismail, an 18-year-old who had
come to Jerusalem from a village outside the West Bank city of
Bethlehem. During times of tension, Israel sometimes bans men deemed
to be of fighting age -- between 18 and 35 or even 55 -- from
entering the Old City on prayer days. No such restrictions were
imposed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to mend internal rifts among Palestinians,
representatives of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction and exiled leaders of the militant Islamic group Hamas
were to hold weekend talks in Cairo, officials from both sides said.</TE>
<TE>   A feud broke out this fall in the Gaza Strip between Fatah and
Hamas over the killing of a Palestinian Authority police commander by
a Hamas militant. The two sides might also try to reach an
understanding on larger strategic matters, people scheduled to
participate said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Fatah officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Hamas would be asked to consider halting suicide attacks in Israeli
cities. The attacks have drawn a strong military response from Israel
and left most of the West Bank's major cities encircled and under
curfew. Hamas -- responsible for attacks that have killed scores of
Israelis -- has not given any indication it would be receptive to
such a truce.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, meanwhile, said Friday that they intended to submit
written remarks next week on a U.S.-sponsored peace plan, although
most observers believe it is likely to founder while Israel is in the
midst of a campaign for national elections early next year.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, is due to arrive next week for
talks with both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Israel and the Palestinians have been cool to the Bush
administration's "road map," which is intended to lead to the
creation of a provisional Palestinian state next year. Newly
appointed Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already irritated
his boss, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, by being too dismissive of the
U.S. proposals, Israeli media have reported.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Netanyahu are locked in a rivalry for leadership of
their conservative Likud Party in advance of nationwide voting
expected to take place Jan. 28. Polls published in Israeli newspapers
Friday gave Sharon an edge over Netanyahu in the leadership contest.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the Israeli army said a Palestinian man was fatally
shot by Israeli troops looking for militants in the Tulkarm refugee
camp in the northern West Bank. Another Palestinian man was killed
near the city of Nablus when troops opened fire on a car, witnesses
said.</TE>
<TE>   The army had no immediate comment.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for Alleged Bin Laden Recruiters</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy</DL>
<LD>The trial of three North Africans charged with giving logistical
support to the Al Qaeda terrorist network began under tight security
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The trial comes a year after the defendants were arrested in Milan
in Italy's first major anti-terrorism crackdown after the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The men are accused of criminal association, possession of arms
and explosives, and of supplying false documents to members of Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said the four are not directly connected to the
Sept. 11 attacks but recruited fighters to train in Osama bin Laden's
camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Yassine Chekkouri, a Moroccan, and Abdelhalim Hafed Remadna of
Algeria worked at Milan's Islamic Cultural Center, which the U.S.
government has described as the main Al Qaeda cell in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The two men sat behind bars in an iron cage in court, surrounded
by six prison guards.</TE>
<TE>   The third defendant, Nabil Benattia of Tunisia, believed to have
been a frequent visitor to the Islamic center, sat in a separate
cage.</TE>
<TE>   Also listed as a defendant was Abdelkader Mahmoud Es Sayed, an
Egyptian, described by police as the organizer of the Milan cell.
Police believe he died while fighting for Bin Laden in Afghanistan,
but he is being tried in absentia because his death has not been
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Stefano Dambruoso, Italy's leading anti-terrorism prosecutor,
arrived at the courthouse protected by a security detail carrying
submachine guns.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the opening hearing was devoted to defense objections
about the validity of documents from European investigators who are
looking into terrorist networks' links to Europe.</TE>

<KH>U.N. ULTIMATUM ON IRAQ</KH>
<HD>To Backers and Foes of War Alike, U.N. Vote Is Validation</HD>
<DH>In the United States, at least, the Security Council's
resolution on Iraq has managed to disarm something: opposition to
invasion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush earned praise from both ends of the political spectrum
Friday, but for different reasons: Some said the U.N. Security
Council's approval of his Iraq resolution made war more likely,
others that it made it less.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, those for and against war with Iraq saw the U.N. vote as
validating their approach. Republicans and political conservatives
said it laid the ground for their "zero tolerance" approach to Saddam
Hussein's alleged efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
Democrats and liberals said the new resolution was a victory for
their insistence that the United States not go it alone but work
through diplomacy and the United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   The result is that whether or not the U.N. resolution ever disarms
Iraq, it has -- at least temporarily -- disarmed the potential U.S.
opposition.</LD>
<TE>   "By going through the United Nations, we have gained critical
international support if it becomes necessary to use force to disarm
Saddam," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Democrat who
voted only reluctantly for a congressional authorization of the use
of force against Iraq. "This demonstrates the wisdom of working with
the international community, as many of us in Congress had urged the
administration to do."</TE>
<TE>   Similar views were expressed on the Republican side.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us have been arguing for the last several months that
this is exactly the way we should go," said Sen. Charles Hagel of
Nebraska. "It gives us the moral argument if we do decide to use
force."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials insist the U.N. resolution does not
handcuff the United States. But others disagreed, saying it still
imposes significant barriers to the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), who set off a firestorm of criticism
by visiting Iraq this fall, said the White House view is mistaken.</TE>
<TE>   "The president can always turn on the spin machine and say we're
going to war, but that would not be in compliance with this
resolution," McDermott said. "I think this sets the stage for the
peaceful disarmament of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly the only criticism of the administration's policy -- and
certainly the toughest -- came from the conservative wing of Bush's
own camp, which supports unilateral action and believes that the
president has allowed the United States to be handicapped.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no point in kidding ourselves: The inspections process
on which we are to embark is a trap," William Kristol and Robert
Kagan wrote in an editorial that is scheduled to appear Nov. 18 in
the conservative Weekly Standard. "It may well be one that this
powerful and determined president can get out of, but it is a trap
nonetheless.... The process established by the U.N. Security Council
makes it harder, not easier, for the president to accomplish what he
has long stated as his objective in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The antiwar movement had been suspicious that the Bush
administration would manipulate or bypass the United Nations. Despite
ongoing opposition to the use of force, many in the movement
expressed approval of the outcome in the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   John Cavanaugh, director of the Institute for Policy Studies and a
leader of recent protests in Washington, said many had feared the
United States would ramrod through the council a resolution
permitting U.S. unilateral action.</TE>
<TE>   "But in the last six weeks, the other nations of the world stood
up to the United States and forced four rounds of concessions,"
Cavanaugh said. "The U.N. resolution is a big victory for the antiwar
movement and for the American people, who have said they don't want a
unilateral war."</TE>
<TE>   The temporary detente in the public debate makes sense in
historical terms, said John Mueller, who studies national security
and public opinion at Ohio State University. Even during the Cold
War, he said, surveys showed that the American people didn't object
to going to war but that they didn't like the idea of doing so
unilaterally.</TE>
<TE>   "For many people, this resolution gives the legal justification
for going over to the favorable side," Mueller said. He said the Bush
administration was savvy to accept some constraints on its actions in
return for greater public approval.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations inspections process "adds a hurdle [on going to
war], but it's a hurdle that's smart," Mueller said. "If a war goes
awry, the criticism won't be as harsh."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Mann, an expert on government and public opinion at the
liberal Brookings Institution, said public opinion and elite
opposition were critical to the Bush administration's decision to
seek the United Nations' sanction for any use of force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "They saw there was great ambivalence about this," Mann said. "The
public was willing to support the president, but they wanted
validation from Congress and the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Mann said that in the wake of the U.N. vote, he would rate the
chance of a peaceful resolution of the confrontation with Iraq at
about 20% -- not a probability, but "not a trivial" possibility. And
that is enough, he said, to keep most war skeptics on the
administration's side, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   Mann said Friday's resolution offers something to both camps: "For
some it simply legitimates a preexisting desire to go to war, and for
others it offers the possibilities of avoiding war."</TE>
<TE>   But in the future, Mann added, such divisions may return.</TE>
<TE>   "There may come a time when President Bush breaks away from a
multilateral approach," he said. "And at that time, the opposition
would resurface."</TE>

<KH>U.N. ULTIMATUM ON IRAQ</KH>
<HD>Syria's Surprise Vote Could Be an Eye-Opener for Iraqi
Leader</HD>

<DL>DAMASCUS, Syria</DL>
<LD>DAMASCUS, Syria -- Everyone was expecting a tough U.N. resolution on
Iraqi weapons inspections to pass Friday, but the shock for Baghdad
must have come when Syria, the only Arab country on the Security
Council, signed on at the last minute to make the vote unanimous.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise "yes" from Fayssal Mekdad, the Syrian envoy at the
United Nations, sent a clear signal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
that few--if any--Arab states will rally to his side if Iraq evades
or defies the U.N. arms inspectors who plan to travel soon to
Baghdad, observers said.</LD>
<LD>   A long and intense decision-making process by Damascus, coupled
with the high-level lobbying of Syrian President Bashar Assad by
world leaders such as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and French
President Jacques Chirac, persuaded Syria to back the resolution
rather than abstain, as had been widely expected.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, analysts and government officials here in the Syrian
capital said, Syria decided that the resolution was balanced and that
voting for it would help preserve the credibility of the Security
Council. And, they said, Assad and his advisors realized that a
symbolic abstention by their country wouldn't help Iraq much but
would leave Syria seeming dangerously out of step with the world
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Syria does not want to alienate the United States right now,"
said political analyst Murhaf Jouejati of the Washington-based Middle
East Institute think tank. "But this does not mean Syria will bend
over backward for the United States, either."</TE>
<TE>   He said Syria remains "vehemently opposed" to a U.S. war against
Iraq but saw the resolution as the best way to avoid that outcome by
giving Baghdad a chance to comply fully with the disarmament demands.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the vote, Mekdad offered up Syria's reasoning.
He said his country had received assurances from permanent Security
Council members that the resolution "would not be used as a pretext
to strike Iraq and does not constitute a basis for any automatic
strikes."</TE>
<TE>   Under the resolution, he said, Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity would be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling that Assad's late father, Hafez, had joined the
anti-Iraq coalition in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and even sent troops
against Iraq, Jouejati said the situation today is different: Hussein
has not invaded any country, and even the accusations that he has
developed weapons of mass destruction are in dispute.</TE>
<TE>   What was important for the Syrian government this time, he said,
was not to dilute the Security Council's "international credibility"
by allowing the United States to carry out attacks on its own. Under
Friday's resolution, Washington is expected to consult with the
council again before beginning any military operation against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution itself had been considerably "mitigated" during the
last eight weeks of negotiations to remove any automatic trigger for
war, said Georges Jabbour, a political analyst and longtime advisor
to Hafez Assad.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are really witnessing is not Syria's change of attitude
but America's change of attitude," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that Iraq cooperates with the new inspections and is not
harboring secret weapons of mass destruction, war will be averted, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two months, Jabbour said, President Bush came to
realize that most of the world doesn't consider war against Iraq a
necessity. By joining in the milder resolution, Syria endorsed a
compromise that both "preserved the face of the United States and
preserved the state of peace in the region," Jabbour said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Syria had been cooperating with the United States in
the war on terrorism during the last year by turning over to the
United States intelligence it had about Al Qaeda terrorist operations
and suspects. The vote on the U.N. resolution, he said, was another
example of Syria's moderation and would confound those U.S.
politicians who wish to portray Syria as extremist, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will isolate the American extremists who would like to see
Syria in difficulty," he said.</TE>

<HD>Europe Is No Place for Turkey, Official Declares</HD>
<DH>Panel leader sparks outrage by saying the nation should not
be admitted into the EU.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>The elder statesman drafting a constitution for the EU sparked a
furor Friday by saying Turkey was not a European country and its
entry would be "the end of the European Union."</LD>
<LD>   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 76, head of the
Convention on the Future of Europe, told the newspaper Le Monde that
those who backed Turkey's candidacy were "the adversaries of the
European Union."</LD>
<LD>   His outspoken comments caused uproar and embarrassment in Brussels
and outraged Turkish representatives in the convention. One European
Parliament member, Swedish Socialist Jan Andersson, called for
Giscard's resignation.</LD>
<TE>   The European Commission was quick to distance itself from the
comments, which heightened controversy within the 15-nation bloc over
the EU's eventual borders once it concludes talks with 10 mainly
Eastern European candidates next month.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to Turkey's Muslim population and high birthrate, Giscard
said that the country had "a different culture, a different approach,
a different way of life" and that its demographic dynamism would
potentially make it the biggest EU member state.</TE>
<TE>   "Its capital is not in Europe; 95% of its population live outside
Europe; it is not a European country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Admitting Turkey, an official candidate since 1999, would go
"outside the continent" and prompt demands to admit other Middle
Eastern and North African states, starting with Morocco, he said.
Asked what the effect would be, he said: "In my opinion, it would be
the end of the European Union."</TE>
<TE>   Ali Tekin, Turkish parliamentary representative in the 105-member
convention, said Giscard is "a Christian fundamentalist." But the
head of the party set to form Turkey's next government, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, played down the comments as "nothing more than emotion."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are excerpts from the text of the United Nations Security
Council resolution on Iraq. The text reads that the Security Council:</LD>
<LD>   Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its
obligations under relevant resolutions, including Resolution 687
(1991), in particular through Iraq's failure to cooperate with United
Nations inspectors and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency).</LD>
<LD>   Decides that, in order to begin to comply with its disarmament
obligations, in addition to submitting the required biannual
declarations, the government of Iraq shall provide to UNMOVIC (U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission), the IAEA and the
council, not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a
currently accurate, full and complete declaration of all aspects of
its programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Decides that false statements or omissions in the declarations
submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at
any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation
of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of
Iraq's obligations and will be reported to the council for
assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Instructs UNMOVIC and requests the IAEA to resume inspections no
later than 45 days following adoption of this resolution and to
update the council 60 days thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Requests the secretary-general immediately to notify Iraq of this
resolution, which is binding on Iraq; demands that Iraq confirm
within seven days of that notification its intention to comply fully
with this resolution; and demands further that Iraq cooperate
immediately, unconditionally and actively with UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</TE>
<TE>   Directs the executive chairman of UNMOVIC and the director general
of the IAEA to report immediately to the council any interference by
Iraq with inspection activities, as well as any failure by Iraq to
comply with its disarmament obligations, including its obligations
regarding inspections under this resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Decides to convene immediately upon receipt of a report ... in
order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with
all of the relevant council resolutions in order to secure
international peace and security.</TE>
<TE>   Recalls ... that the council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it
will face serious consequences as a result of its continued
violations of its obligations.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Gives Iraq 'Final' Chance/ Resolution Warns Regime of
'Serious Consequences' if It Fails to Disarm</HD>
<DH>Unanimous vote is seen as endorsement of U.S. effort to
work through the world body. Bush emphasizes America's freedom to act
alone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The Security Council voted unanimously Friday to give Iraq "a final
opportunity" to disarm or face "serious consequences," bolstering the
role of the United Nations in the world and rewarding the United
States' willingness to engage it.</LD>
<LD>   The show of international unity sent a strong message to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that he is without allies if he continues to
defy the United Nations, ambassadors said. And the consensus was
hailed as a striking endorsement of the U.S. decision to work through
the council on a crucial issue instead of going around it.</LD>
<LD>   "To the government of Iraq, our message is simple," U.S.
Ambassador John D. Negroponte said after the vote. "Noncompliance is
no longer an option. To our colleagues on the council, our message is
one of partnership."</LD>
<TE>   But in the White House Rose Garden moments after the vote,
President Bush emphasized Washington's freedom to act alone if
necessary, threatening Iraq with "the severest consequences" if it
fails to comply with the new resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-0 result was a surprise after nearly two months of intense
negotiations. The day before the vote, a last-minute compromise on
language to ensure that the U.S. would not use the resolution as a
pretext for military force clinched the support of France, China,
Mexico and Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia's vote wasn't confirmed until an early-morning phone
call Friday from Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov to Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell, and Negroponte only learned the Syrian
diplomat's intentions as they walked into the Security Council
chamber together for the vote on U.N. Resolution 1441.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq now has seven days to confirm its compliance with the
resolution, and 23 more days to come up with a full declaration of
any weapons of mass destruction and missiles used to deliver them.
The Security Council will grant Baghdad a little more time to catalog
"dual-use" material used in its petrochemical industry.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution states that weapons inspectors will begin their
work within 45 days and make their first report to the council 60
days after they begin -- although they may report infractions at any
time. Chief inspector Hans Blix said he and an advance team would be
in Baghdad on Nov. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Patient and painstaking diplomacy, bolstered by a dose of
"creative ambiguity," allowed all sides to claim victory Friday. The
resolution links but doesn't chain Washington to the Security
Council, reflecting France's insistence that any determination that
Iraq has violated its obligations be made by the council, not the
U.S. alone. But it doesn't force the U.S. to wait for a second
Security Council resolution before launching military action against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The outcome of the current crisis is already determined. The full
disarmament of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq will occur. They
only question for the Iraqi regime is to decide how," Bush said in
his Rose Garden comments. "The United States prefers that Iraq meets
its obligations voluntarily, yet we are prepared for the alternative.
In either case, the just demands of the world will be met."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also had praise for the U.N. "Members of the council acted
with courage and took a principled stand," he said. "The United
Nations has shown the kind of international leadership promised by
its charter and required by our times."</TE>
<TE>   But the same ambiguity that allowed a compromise also foreshadows
trouble to come. In the same breath they lauded the council's
consensus, several ambassadors noted their different interpretations
of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the central disagreement of whether the document simply
establishes the legal groundwork for a U.S.-led war or is the best
means to avoid it, Mexican Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar Zinser insisted,
"The use of force is subject to the prior and explicit authorization
of the Security Council."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the council's permanent members -- France, China and
Russia -- felt compelled to issue a joint declaration after the vote,
putting on record their understanding of the resolution and the U.S.
and British pledges that it does not contain provisions for the
automatic use of force.</TE>
<TE>   The three also took issue with the U.S assertion that any council
member can judge that Iraq has violated the resolution and ask the
council to consider the consequences. They insist that only the
weapons inspectors have the authority to report a possible breach.</TE>
<TE>   Initial Iraqi reaction came from Ambassador Mohammed Douri, who
spoke immediately after the vote. "Iraq will certainly study the
resolution and decide whether we can accept it or not," he said.
During the negotiations, he and other Iraqi officials repeatedly
characterized the resolution as a "a blueprint for war."</TE>
<TE>   Fulfilling one of Washington's core demands, the new resolution
declares that Iraq remains in "material breach" of past U.N.
resolutions requiring disarmament -- a key legal term that can be
used to justify military action. It threatens to consider "serious
consequences" -- understood to mean the use of force -- if Iraq is
found in further material breach.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution is designed to disarm Iraq through inspections,
said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the document's co-sponsor,
and is not meant to set tripwires to spark a war. To that end, it
strengthens an inspection regime that has failed in the past. Weapons
inspectors left the country in 1998, and Iraq has blocked their entry
since.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a shadow of a doubt remained that Iraq had defied the United
Nations for the past 11 years -- the U.N. will no longer tolerate
this defiance," Greenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not afford to have inspectors standing by helplessly
while crucial documents are burnt or while convoys leave from the
back doors as inspectors arrive in the front," he said. "We could not
afford interviews compromised by intimidating minders."</TE>
<TE>   The document contains an elaborate description of the terms of
inspection, giving inspectors the authority to demand "immediate,
unimpeded, unconditional and unrestricted access" to any site in
Iraq, including presidential compounds that had been protected by
special agreements in the past that made surprise inspections
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   It retains controversial provisions to take Iraqi scientists and
their families out of the country for interviews in order to avoid
intimidation by government "minders," but chief inspector Blix has
questioned the practicality of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   All over the world, reaction to the long-awaited resolution was
swift and strong.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had risked his political
fortune by standing up in support of Bush despite broad British
opposition to unilateral U.S. military action against Iraq, was
clearly delighted by the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam must now make his choice," Blair told reporters at 10
Downing St., his residence. "My message to him is this: Disarm, or
you face force. Be under no doubt whatsoever of that.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooperate fully, and we will be just with you," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing some of the phrases Bush delivered at the White House on
Friday, Blair said, "Conflict is not inevitable, but disarmament is."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's new foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, supported for
the resolution and congratulated Bush for "leading this initiative,"
the Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement. Iraq fired 39 Scud
missiles at Israel during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and the current
government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon believes that an Iraqi
strike against Israel is likely if the U.S. attacks Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Kurdistan, which has been a self-ruled enclave since
1991, Iraqi opposition leaders were both pleased and worried about
the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   There is concern that the U.N. might succeed in disarming Hussein
-- but leave him in power.</TE>
<TE>   "One option is that this man abandons his weapons of mass
destruction totally and absolutely--and remains in power," said Sami
Abdurrahman, deputy prime minister of the northern sector ruled by
the Kurdistan Democratic Party. "The other option is that he keeps
his weapons of mass destruction and then loses his head. And
unfortunately, Saddam is a survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Others predicted that the U.N. disarmament effort is destined to
fail.</TE>
<TE>   "Baghdad can't be disarmed, and you can't guarantee Baghdad will
remain disarmed for five or 10 years, unless there is a democracy in
place," said Fawzi Hariri, a top Kurdistan Democratic Party advisor.</TE>

<HD>CIA Strike May Link 6 in U.S. to Al Qaeda</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. citizen killed by a CIA missile in Yemen may
have been a leader of six Al Qaeda suspects indicted recently in
Buffalo, N.Y., on terrorism charges, U.S. officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed, the connection buttresses prosecutors' claims that
the suspects were part of an Al Qaeda sleeper cell and posed a
serious threat to national security.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they are seeking to determine whether Ahmed Hijazi
-- the name of the U.S. citizen killed in Yemen on Sunday -- is Kamal
Derwish, who is wanted in connection with the Buffalo case. Hijazi
apparently matches the alias used by Derwish, one of two fugitives in
that case, said a senior U.S. official.</LD>
<TE>   "We are looking into the possibility that the American in the car
may have been using an alias and in fact may have been Kamal
Derwish," another official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to tell" for certain whether Derwish was in the
car, particularly since the missile caused so much damage that there
were scant human remains to recover, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA and FBI are trying to get conclusive evidence that Derwish
was in the car through forensic tests on the remains, including DNA
sampling and other means, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that the American-born Derwish, who has spent
much of his 29 years living in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, guided the
others in the Buffalo case to an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the
spring of 2001 after they had made their way to Pakistan, ostensibly
to pursue religious studies.</TE>
<TE>   At that Al-Farooq camp, federal prosecutors said in recent court
testimony, the men underwent weapons training and heard Osama bin
Laden give a fiery speech, calling on Muslims to rise up against the
United States and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Derwish is one of at least two men wanted for
questioning because of their alleged ties to the six men, accused of
operating a sleeper cell in the Upstate New York town of Lackawanna.
Derwish left the United States before the FBI made its arrests in
September, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials stressed that they have not been able to positively
identify five of the six suspected Al Qaeda figures killed when an
unmanned CIA surveillance plane fired a Hellfire missile at their
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The only man U.S. officials are certain was killed in the blast is
Qaed Sinan Harithi, a high-ranking Al Qaeda operative who was the
principal target.</TE>
<TE>   Harithi was a former bodyguard to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's
top commander in Yemen, officials said. He is suspected of planning
two attacks off the Yemeni coast -- the 2000 bombing of the U.S.
destroyer Cole in which 17 U.S. sailors were killed, and the bombing
of a French tanker last month that killed one crewman.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests in September had been downplayed even by some in law
enforcement as a roundup of men who had attended Al Qaeda training
camps in Afghanistan but did not appear to be engaged in terrorist
plots.</TE>
<TE>   If authorities can show that it was Derwish traveling with
Harithi, it would be the first significant link between the alleged
Lackawanna cell and a high-ranking Al Qaeda operative.</TE>
<TE>   Derwish was believed to be hiding out in Yemen while the FBI and
CIA pursued him so he could be questioned in connection with the
Lackawanna case.</TE>
<TE>   All six of the Lackawanna suspects are of Yemeni descent and were
indicted on charges of providing material support to a terrorist
organization -- Al Qaeda. They lived within blocks of one another in
the dying steel town near Buffalo and Lake Erie.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment listed two men as being co-conspirators, though
they were not indicted. Those two were not named, but authorities
said Friday that one of them was Derwish, a burly and vocal Islamic
activist in the local Yemeni community. Derwish is believed to have
acted as a ringleader of sorts who helped radicalize and recruit the
others.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said Friday that much of their information
indicating that Derwish and the other unindicted suspect were
affiliated with the alleged sleeper cell came from informants within
the Muslim community in Lackawanna and that the information has not
been corroborated.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a senior U.S. official said, "We have reason to
believe they are connected based on our investigation, and that they
engaged in activity very similar to the six" men who have been
indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Battle, the U.S. attorney for the Upstate New York region
that includes Buffalo and Lackawanna, confirmed that authorities want
to question Derwish in connection with the case. But he said he had
been given no details as to whether Derwish was in the car that was
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "As would be clear from our complaint, there are two individuals
out there that we have an interest in," Battle said. "That
investigation continues, and whether or not those two individuals
have any connection to this bombing incident we have no knowledge of
and are in no position to comment on."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have described the six alleged co-conspirators
named in the indictment as unwitting dupes who had no intention of
carrying out terrorist acts in the United States or elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   All six remain in custody, even though a judge ordered one of them
freed pending trial, in part because of his cooperation with
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA strike represented an aggressive new tack in the war on
terrorism, marking the first time the United States has launched a
military-style assault on Al Qaeda suspects outside the war theater
of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Some have expressed alarm at the nature of the attack, saying it
amounted to an "extrajudicial" execution. The subsequent development
that there was a U.S. citizen in the vehicle was seen by some legal
experts as even more troubling. Americans are traditionally afforded
significant legal protections, even when they are overseas and are
linked to U.S. enemy groups.</TE>
<TE>   John Walker Lindh, the American captured in the fighting in
Afghanistan last year, was brought to the United States for trial. As
part of a negotiated plea agreement, Lindh pleaded guilty Oct. 5 to
aiding and abetting the Taliban and was sentenced to 20 years in
prison. He could have up to three years deducted from the sentence
for good behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they didn't know who was in the vehicle with
Harithi, let alone that a U.S. citizen was among the car's occupants.
One senior U.S. official said it was of little significance that an
American was in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a citizen associated with five other terrorists
planning and conducting terrorist operations, call me crazy, I think
you're a terrorist," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Those indicted in Buffalo are Yasein Taher, Sahim Alwan, Faysal
Galab, Yahya Goba, Shafal Mosed and Mukhtar al-Bakri, all between 22
and 29 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The other alleged co-conspirator not indicted, identified by
authorities as Jaber Elbaneh, also was believed to be hiding in
Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   During court proceedings, Alwan testified that although he
attended the Al-Farooq camp in Afghanistan, he left 10 days later
"after realizing the crazy, radical mentality" of people there.</TE>

<HD>Last SLA Fugitive, on Run Since '75, Held in S. Africa</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- After a generation on the run, the last Symbionese
Liberation Army fugitive was arrested Friday in South Africa, a day
after four allies from the radical 1970s group pleaded guilty to a
27-year-old murder in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   FBI officials said South African police apprehended James William
Kilgore, 55, without incident at the home he shared with his wife and
two young children in the upscale Cape Town suburb of Claremont.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Mershon, FBI special agent in charge of the San Francisco
office, said Kilgore, an instructor at the University of Cape Town,
was shown a wanted poster and asked if he was the man. "Yes, that's
me," Kilgore responded, Mershon said.</LD>
<TE>   Kilgore's wife, an American who also worked at the university, was
at home at the time of the arrest but was not taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very rare fugitive who entirely cuts off his past and
lives in a vacuum," Mershon said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said Kilgore had lived in South Africa since 1989.
But a spokeswoman for the South African Police Agency, Mary
Martins-Engelbrecht, said the fugitive entered the country five years
ago using a false name. Police believe he may also have spent several
years in Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore had been on the run since 1975, shortly before he was
indicted for allegedly possessing a destructive device after
authorities recovered explosives at an SLA hide-out near San
Francisco. He also faces charges as a participant in the robbery of a
suburban Sacramento bank that ended in the shotgun slaying of Myrna
Opsahl, a 42-year-old mother of four.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris, Emily Harris Montague, Michael Bortin and Sara
Jane Olson pleaded guilty to that murder Thursday as part of a deal
that called for jail terms of six to eight years, sparing them a
trial that could have meant life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl's family expressed relief over the capture. Jon Opsahl, who
spent much of his adult life in a quest to bring his mother's killers
to justice, said he would like to see Kilgore accept the same plea
deal given to the four others.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just kind of a loose end that's out there, and if we can get
it wrapped up and have him admit his guilt in the Carmichael bank
robbery and my mother's murder and serve his time, it would be better
for everyone involved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Kevin Ryan said the timing of Kilgore's arrest, less
than 24 hours after the four other former SLA members admitted their
guilt in court, was purely coincidental and not part of the earlier
plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   Mershon said there had been discussions about Kilgore voluntarily
surrendering. But the FBI, he said, continued to pursue him as a
wanted felon.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had suspected since the early 1980s that he might be
hiding somewhere in Africa. South African police had been hunting for
Kilgore for several months. FBI agents received a tip about 10 days
ago, narrowing the search to Cape Town, Mershon said.</TE>
<TE>   "This man has been wanted by the FBI for almost 30 years," he
said. "This has never been a cold case." The timing of the arrest "is
truly a coincidence," he said. "Life is full of coincidences."</TE>
<TE>   Several defense attorneys in the Sacramento murder case said
Kilgore had been trying through a lawyer on the East Coast to
negotiate his voluntary surrender and a plea bargain similar to those
accepted by his former comrades in the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems mean-spirited to do it this way," said Alex Reisman, a
San Francisco attorney who represent William Harris. "Why didn't they
just let him turn himself in? There's no such thing as coincidences."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan also denied reports that Kilgore had been negotiating with at
least one defense attorney representing other SLA members.</TE>
<TE>   "The negotiations [in Sacramento] have no part in what transpired
here," Ryan said. "There was no cooperation between the defense team
in that case and this arrest. The two are not attached in any way."</TE>
<TE>   In South Africa, Kilgore adopted the pseudonym Charles William
Pape and taught English at the University of Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   C.W. Pape is listed on the university's Web site as project
coordinator for the International Labor Resource and Information
Group, known as a left-leaning think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore was being held over the weekend at the Claremont jail and
was scheduled to appear in a South African court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said he planned to immediately extradite Kilgore to San
Francisco to stand trial on federal charges of possession of an
unregistered explosive device, a pipe bomb that authorities found in
1976 among possessions being moved from an SLA safe house in Daly
City, a San Francisco suburb. The charges carry a penalty of up to 10
years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Kilgore also is expected to face
the Sacramento murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to see Mr. Kilgore in this district soon and expect to
prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   A Portland, Ore., native, Kilgore grew up in the Bay Area and
attended San Rafael High School in Marin County. His father was a
wealthy Marin County lumber dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Patterson, a classmate of Kilgore at San Rafael High School,
described him as a popular, "almost brilliant guy" with an offbeat
sense of humor. "He was not a sinister character. He came from a
really good family; he was a really well-adjusted guy."</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Kilgore graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in
economics. By then, Patterson said, it was clear that "getting caught
up in politics had pushed him over the top" in a radical direction.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore's introduction to the SLA came along with his girlfriend,
Olson, known then as Kathleen Soliah.</TE>
<TE>   A sports enthusiast, Kilgore had dropped out of a graduate program
in economics at UC Santa Barbara and was thinking of becoming a
sportswriter or a photographer, according to "The Voices of Guns," a
book about the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he wound up getting work as a house painter for Michael
Bortin, at the time a Berkeley student who had started his own
contracting company.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore and Soliah joined the SLA after Soliah gave an impassioned
speech at a memorial rally in Berkeley for six members of the group
who died in a shootout with Los Angeles police. Newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst, who had been kidnapped and converted to the group's
cause, recalled going with Bill and Emily Harris to meet them at a
drive-in movie theater in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "They were parked in the movie section showing ... a soft-core
porno film called 'Teacher's Pet,' " she recalled in her book, "Every
Secret Thing." "Jim Kilgore looked like the typical intellectual,
unkempt Berkeley student, with wire-rim spectacles, 6 feet tall with
medium-brown long hair, wearing a wrinkled T-shirt. He also had, I
noticed, a little paunch."</TE>
<TE>   In her book, Hearst portrayed Kilgore as a voice of moderation, or
what passed for it in the immoderate world of the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   During that introductory meeting, Hearst wrote, Soliah said she
was ready to go underground and get involved in revolutionary action.
Kilgore's response, Hearst said, was: "No! I don't think any of us
should get into any action now. It is just too hot for that."</TE>
<TE>   At another point, Hearst describes a day when the group was hiding
in an apartment in Berkeley and heard sirens on the street outside.
Looking out the window, they saw firetrucks. "Combat positions!"
yelled Bill Harris, according to Hearst. Kilgore, she said, calmly
suggested that the appearance of firetrucks probably meant there was
a fire nearby, which turned out to be the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim Kilgore," she wrote, "was the model of reason."</TE>
<TE>   Hearst wrote that he argued against using guns in the robbery of a
Crocker National Bank branch in Carmichael, in which Emily Montague
now says her shotgun went off accidentally, killing Opsahl as she
arrived to count church receipts.</TE>
<TE>   "You better not take that gun," Hearst quotes Kilgore as telling
Montague, then known as Emily Harris. "It's got a hair trigger and,
besides, you don't need a shotgun inside a bank."</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for Kilgore intensified after Olson's arrest in 1999. He
was featured on the TV show "America's Most Wanted," which yielded
several hundred tips. But until recently, authorities said, there had
not been a single confirmed sighting of him in more than two decades.</TE>

<HD>Gov. Siegelman Dealt Setback in Alabama Recount Bid</HD>
<DH>The state's Republican attorney general rules that the
sealed ballots can't be opened just because the Democrat trails his
challenger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Democratic Gov. Donald Siegelman's call for a statewide recount
suffered a blow Friday when the Republican attorney general said
sealed ballots can't be opened just because the governor trails his
GOP challenger.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion of Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor came as Alabama's 67 counties
certified their votes, with official results showing Siegelman
trailing U.S. Rep. Bob Riley by 3,117 votes. In some counties there
was a change from the unofficial numbers reported Tuesday night, but
not enough to change the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't break the seal based on not liking the count," Pryor
said in an opinion awaited by election officials statewide.</LD>
<TE>   Rip Andrews, a Siegelman campaign spokesman, said, "The bottom
line is it's a Republican conspiracy at its worst."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't immediately clear whether the governor would go to court
to try to force a recount or take the issue before the Legislature,
which doesn't convene until January.</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman demanded a recount Thursday. He pointed in particular to
Baldwin County, where officials reduced his tally by about 7,000
votes late Tuesday -- enough to give Riley the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The county blamed a glitch in its computer system for the
revision, but the first-term governor said the switch was made after
poll workers left for the night.</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman attorney Joe Espy accused the attorney general of
ignoring state regulations that provide for a recount. "On behalf of
Bob Riley, the Republican attorney general today changed the law,"
Espy said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the governor won't give up on seeking a recount, but he
hasn't decided what his next action will be.</TE>
<TE>   Riley and his attorneys praised Pryor's decision. "Atty. Gen. Bill
Pryor is doing constitutionally what he is supposed to do," lawyer
Terry Butts said.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama law does not provide for an automatic recount in tight
races, but any voter can ask for one, county by county, if a bond is
posted to pay for it. Democratic supporters began filing recount
petitions across the state Friday, with Siegelman's campaign or the
Democratic Party offering to pay for the bonds if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   However, election officials were advised by Secretary of State Jim
Bennett to wait for Pryor's opinion, in part to "avoid the situation
that arose in Florida."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama has never had a statewide recount and some of its election
laws date to the 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   Pryor said the governor's petitions aren't sufficient to unseal
the ballots and other election records.</TE>
<TE>   He said Siegelman could get the ballots opened under only two
scenarios:</TE>
<TE>   * He files an election contest with the Legislature and shows that
illegal ballots were counted or legal ballots weren't counted and
that those would change the results.</TE>
<TE>   The new Legislature would consider a contest in January, when it
convenes to certify the final voting results.</TE>
<TE>   * He gets a judge to order a recount in a county after finding
that a voting machine or precinct did not make a report on election
night.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a crime to break a seal without following these

<TE>   Espy disagreed with Pryor's interpretation and said a recount is
needed to settle the issue in voters' minds.</TE>

in Baldwin County."</TE>

<HD>Arizona Democrat Has Slim Lead</HD>
<DH>Napolitano may have won governor's race in Goldwater
country, as vote counting nears end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona, long perceived as conservative, Barry Goldwater country, has
apparently elected a Democrat as governor while sending a Republican
majority to both houses of the Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano, 44, held a slim lead Friday as
nearly 200,000 ballots continued to be tallied. She was ahead by
about 17,000 votes -- and said she expects to win by at least 10,000.
Pollsters agreed, but her Republican opponent, retired three-term
Rep. Matt Salmon, refused to concede.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona last elected a Democratic governor 20 years ago with Bruce
Babbitt's reelection.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll get along with her," said Jake Flake, speaker of the state
House of Representatives. "I would have preferred a Republican
governor, but sure, we can work with a Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano expects no honeymoon. The state is burdened with a
$500-million budget deficit that is likely to double within a year,
and she said addressing the fiscal crisis will be her immediate
focus.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to make some very painful decisions," said
Napolitano, who was in Napa, Calif., Friday, taking a break after her
campaign. "There are things we can do to get it done, but it will be
a very tough year."</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano said she would cut spending and eliminate some
corporate tax exemptions but would protect education.</TE>
<TE>   She reiterated one campaign mantra: to dismantle the Office of
Excellence in Government. "We ought to expect excellence in every
department of government, and not have a separate office in
government where we hide all the excellence," Napolitano said.</TE>
<TE>   Her election would bring to seven the number of female governors
in the country, the most ever. Hers would be one of 21 Democratic
gubernatorial victories among 36 posts up for election Tuesday. With
the outcome still uncertain in Alabama, Republicans will hold 25
governorships next year and the Democrats 24.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans were not surprised by Napolitano's showing -- many saw
it as comeuppance for a series of fiscal and legislative misfires
during Republican Jane Dee Hull's reign.</TE>
<TE>   A key blunder was a law allowing Arizonans to write off half the
cost of buying new vehicles if they were converted to alternative
energy -- a well-intended environmental act that was going to cost
the state more than $500 million in lost tax revenue before the law
was rewritten and the rush to car dealerships was stemmed.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano, elected attorney general four years ago, won plaudits
as a firm and hard-working prosecutor for her work in consumer
protection, prosecution of crimes against children and support of
capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, she served five years as the state's U.S. attorney, an
appointment by President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have a 6% edge over Democrats in voter registration in
Arizona, but 20% of the voters list themselves as independent.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano was bolstered by other ballot measures that pulled an
uncharacteristically high number of Democratic-leaning Native
Americans to the polls to vote on the expansion of reservation
gambling and to choose Navajo nation leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano had to counter an eleventh-hour blitz of negative ads
and two visits by President Bush on behalf of her opponent, Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   An ad accusing her of not prosecuting a child molester backfired
when an enraged Republican sheriff took to the airwaves in
Napolitano's defense, saying the allegation was untrue and
outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   "Janet was able to get her [voter] base and more, and Salmon ran
an unfocused campaign that lacked a clear message," said Margaret C.
Kenski, a Tucson-based political consultant who usually polls for
Republican campaigns. "But she's certainly quite liberal," Kenski
said, given her stance in favor of abortion rights and support of
such issues as giving payments from the state's victim compensation
fund to undocumented immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   While Napolitano awaited the final results, her father, a retired
medical school dean at the University of New Mexico, wondered how the
election would affect his daughter, who is single and enjoys the
outdoors and travel.</TE>
<TE>   Will she have time to accompany him to the opera next summer in
Santa Fe? "She's a big opera fan," said Leonard Napolitano.</TE>

<HD>Rain Spells Relief From Biscuit Fire in Oregon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A string of rainstorms brought a watery curtain down Friday on the
Biscuit fire, the biggest and most expensive single wildfire in the
nation this year at nearly 500,000 acres and more than $154 million
in firefighting costs.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly four months after the blaze started, control was not
declared until more than 2 inches of rain fell on the fire, said M.J.
Harvie, fire staff officer for Siskiyou National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   To date $154.9 million has been spent putting out the fire, and
almost $7 million more has gone toward rehabilitation, such as
replacing road culverts and seeding burned hillsides, Harvie said.</LD>
<TE>   The runner-up on costs was the Rodeo-Chediski fire in Arizona,
which ran up a bill of $48.7 million while burning through 468,636
acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That fire
destroyed nearly 500 homes and forced 30,000 people to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Biscuit accounted for nearly half the acreage burned in Oregon and
was part of the nation's second-biggest fire season in 50 years. In
all, 6.7 million acres burned and $1.4 billion was spent fighting
fires, the NIFC said.</TE>
<TE>   Kindled by lighting that raked southern Oregon on July 13, the
Biscuit fire hid out in a remote corner of the Siskiyou National
Forest's Kalmiopsis Wilderness for days.</TE>
<TE>   With crews and equipment scarce because of fires burning across
the West, Biscuit reared up to threaten 17,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Originally named Florence for a creek near its birthplace, the
fire was renamed Biscuit after the city of Florence 120 miles north
said it was losing tourists.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, Biscuit was sending up mushroom-shaped plumes of
smoke tens of thousands of feet tall. Thousands of people packed up
and left while nearly 7,000 firefighters based at four camps fought
the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lohrey, who took overall command, saw the fire's potential to
grow to much more than 500,000 acres, reaching the Pacific and the
Cascade Range. Because the fire was in rugged country with few roads,
he adopted a bold strategy of burning out hundreds of thousands of
acres to stop the spread.</TE>
<TE>   When the fire burned through Oak Flat along the Illinois River
west of Selma, logger Jerry Sorensen and his wife, Gayle, stayed on
their 52-acre farm, even after firefighters set their meadow ablaze
as a firebreak and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   "You had fire on three sides of you," Sorensen said. "There was a
lot of stuff falling. When these hillsides ignite, it makes a lot of
noise. It sucked a lot of air and sounded like jets taking off.</TE>
<TE>   "You get scared. You don't know if you made the right decision. On
the other hand, we thought we've got the creek here, green lawns, the
garden, and all the stuff that won't burn. We just thought this was
the place to be."</TE>

<LD>In an exhibit billed as "The Sensuous and the Sacred," the
Smithsonian Institution introduces the public to a Hindu deity called
Shiva. Worshiped in southeast India as the Lord of the Dance, Shiva
plays a variety of roles in Hinduism -- both destroying the universe
and creating it anew.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first time an exhibit devoted to what are called Chola
bronzes has been assembled in the United States, said guest curator
Vidya Dehejia, professor of art history at Columbia University.</LD>
<LD>   The statues were made by unknown sculptors during the Chola
dynasty between AD 850 and 1300.</LD>

<LD>A water main broke Friday on the city's North Side, sending thousands
of gallons gushing onto streets and causing a 30-foot-wide sinkhole.</LD>
<LD>   Police shut down a three-mile stretch of nearby Lake Shore Drive
after getting a report of the broken main at 3:20 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The road was reopened by 7:30 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said the break in the 36-inch main sent water gushing up
to 8 feet in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Water Department officials were trying to determine the
cause.</TE>
<TE>   Repair crews planned to pump out the sinkhole that opened on
Addison Avenue. Two cars were partially submerged and other vehicles
sat tilted along its edge.</TE>
<TE>   Bari Levy, 30, who lives in a building in front of the sinkhole,

<HD>Pelosi Has Lock on House Post</HD>
<DH>California Democrat, by all accounts, has the votes to win
the party leadership job. But her liberal leanings may be fuel for
GOP opponents.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- House Democrats rallied behind Rep. Nancy Pelosi as
their new leader on Friday, putting the San Francisco liberal in line
to become the first woman to lead a party in Congress and the first
Californian to do so since the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Pelosi, who as the minority whip is already the second-ranking
House Democrat, all but clinched the top post after her main
challenger ended his bid. Rep. Martin Frost of Texas dropped out of a
race that officially lasted barely more than 24 hours.</LD>
<LD>   Frost, who had offered himself as a centrist alternative, pledged
to support Pelosi in Thursday's vote among House Democrats to replace
outgoing Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.</LD>
<TE>   As Frost's candidacy evaporated, another Democrat declared he
would oppose Pelosi on a centrist platform. But Rep. Harold E. Ford
Jr. of Tennessee lacks Pelosi's experience and stature within party
circles and was given little chance of success.</TE>
<TE>   "The race is over," Pelosi said at a news conference in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Democrats did not dispute her assertion.</TE>
<TE>   For a party retrenching after Tuesday's stinging electoral losses,
the choice of Pelosi should bring immediate payoffs and a good deal
of risk.</TE>
<TE>   As a woman in a post held until now only by men, she seems likely
to draw more notice than the House minority leader might otherwise
expect.</TE>
<TE>   As a solid liberal who forcefully opposes most of President Bush's
domestic agenda and who voted against the resolution passed last
month authorizing him to use force against Iraq, she may energize the
Democratic faithful.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's vote, in which Republicans picked up House seats
and took control of the Senate, many Democrats have complained that
the party suffered because it did not offer a clear alternative to
the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   And several Democrats praised her political skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Nancy Pelosi is a very pragmatic politician, and she is smart and
savvy and understands the world," said Bill Carrick, a Los
Angeles-based Democratic consultant. "She will do the best she can to
reach out to every aspect of the caucus."</TE>
<TE>   But Pelosi's rise will give Republicans more opportunity to
criticize Democrats as being out of touch with much of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the coronation of Congresswoman Pelosi begin -- and the
eventual fall of the Democrat Party follow," said Rep. Mark Foley
(R-Fla.).</TE>
<TE>   Her record is to the left of Gephardt, a source of worry for some
Democrats. Based on an analysis of key congressional votes, the
National Journal magazine in 2000 gave her a 94% liberal rating on
social issues and 92% on economic issues; Gephardt scored 68% and
84%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   John Anzalone, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster, expressed
concerns about the impact in his region of Pelosi's ascension.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he would advise a candidate to seek Pelosi's help,
Anzalone said: "No. Not a chance. Not because she isn't a good person
and does great work, but the bottom line is the [Republicans]
demonize her ... and she becomes a campaign issue."</TE>
<TE>   Some House Democrats fretted privately that one or more of their
Southern colleagues might bolt the party under Pelosi's leadership, a
notion GOP strategists were happy to encourage. There was no word,
though, of imminent defections.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, at her news conference, claimed to have support from all
corners of her party and to have an "overwhelming majority" of the
roughly 207 House Democrats who will select their next leader by
secret ballot.</TE>
<TE>   To back up her claim, Pelosi made public a list of 111 supporters.
The backers included nearly all of the 33 California Democrats who
will serve in the new House. Many other Democrats, Pelosi said, back
her privately.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst predicted Pelosi's leadership would pose a challenge
for Democrats in the nation's relatively small number of truly
competitive House districts -- the center-left and center-right
terrain where Tuesday's elections were fought and where Republicans
generally prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it very difficult to sell the national Democratic Party
agenda in a place like Texas, for sure," said Bruce Buchanan, a
political scientist at the University of Texas. "Republican
candidates down here already ran against people like Hillary and Bill
[Clinton]. Pelosi is going to make it worse here and elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats disputed that view. Rep. James P. Moran of
Virginia, a centrist who is a Pelosi backer, said the party had lost
touch with many core supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "She's going to be able to broaden the base," Moran said. "She's
going to enlist more young people. She's going to be the kind of
charismatic spokesperson that's going to get the public's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, 62, is by now accustomed to listing precedents on her
resume. As minority whip, she is already the highest-ranking woman
ever to serve in congressional party leadership.</TE>
<TE>   As minority leader, she would set still more firsts: First woman
to lead either party, in either chamber of Congress. First
Californian to lead a congressional party since William F. Knowland
stepped down as Senate minority leader in 1959. First Californian in
the state's 152-year history to lead in the House. The state is bound
to benefit from her new power.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, born to a legendary political family from Baltimore, is
fond of pointing out that she is the first Italian American to rise
to her position.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., served in the House for five
terms and as mayor of Baltimore for three terms. Her brother, Thomas
III, also served as Baltimore mayor and remains a political advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of five children, she attended Trinity College in
Washington, where she met another son of an Italian American
political family, Paul Pelosi.</TE>
<TE>   After her graduation in 1963, the two married, moving to New York,
where Paul Pelosi worked in banking. But he was from San Francisco,
where his brother served on the Board of Supervisors, and he longed
to move home. So they settled there in the late 1960s, and she gave
birth to five children in six years -- four daughters and one son.</TE>
<TE>   When her youngest daughter, Alexandra, was in kindergarten, Pelosi
volunteered to work for the Democratic Party in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, she became party chairwoman for Northern
California, joining forces with the muscular political dynasty of
Phillip Burton, who served in Congress for 20 years as an
old-fashioned, pro-labor Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   When Burton died in 1983, his widow, Sala, won a special election
to complete his term, and later won on her own. When she was dying of
cancer in 1987, she urged Pelosi to run for the seat.</TE>
<TE>   It was Pelosi's closest race. She beat San Francisco Supervisor
Harry Britt, 35% to 31%, in a special election. Since then she's
routinely won with about 80% of the vote in a district that's one of
the nation's most liberal and most Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, she steadily gained seniority on the Appropriations
and Intelligence committees and made many allies through tireless
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, in her first try for leadership, Pelosi bested
Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland for minority whip. The vote was 118
to 95. In her post, Pelosi has stumped for candidates in 30 states
and 90 congressional districts, helping to raise millions of dollars
for Democratic campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi claimed victory Friday in a site with significance for her
career: the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In her comments, Pelosi took pains to avoid major policy
statements. She promised to solicit views from all sectors of the
party. But she said she would dwell on one theme: "It's all about the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that the Democratic Party is the party of
the public interest," Pelosi said. "The Republicans are the party of
the special interests. We have to make that clear to the American
people."</TE>

<HD>Retarded Teen Gets 3 Years in Boy's Drowning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A mildly retarded teenager was sentenced to three years in prison
Friday for the drowning of an autistic 5-year-old boy who prosecutors
say was shoved into a canal and left to die.</LD>
<LD>   Gorman Roberts, 18, was convicted of manslaughter for the Feb. 10
killing. Prosecutors said he laughed as the boy, Jordan Payne, died
in the weed-filled waterway not far from his father's home in Pompano
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The defense said Jordan, who was unable to talk or swim, slipped
during a tussle. They also said Roberts was mentally incapable of
recklessly or flagrantly disregarding the boy's safety, a component
that is required for a manslaughter conviction.</LD>
<TE>   Roberts was 17 when the drowning occurred, but he was charged as
an adult and faced up to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The jury wasn't told the special education student had an IQ in
the mid-60s, though his attorney hinted the teen was retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Victor Tobin ordered Roberts treated as a youthful offender
and housed with convicts 22 and under.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horrible thing that's happened here," the judge said. "I
don't believe that he set out to do this. By the same token, there
has to be some degree of punishment. It just cries out for it."</TE>
<TE>   The victim's mother, Zola Hayes, stormed out of the courtroom
sobbing after hearing the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Her cousin Lureather Williams said: "It's not fair. You get more
time to break in someone's house than to kill someone."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts read from the Bible while waiting for his case to be
called, and he gave his relatives a thumbs-up sign as he waited to be
booked into jail.</TE>
<TE>   His aunt and guardian, Carrie Mae Lovett, said she was relieved by
the sentence. "I sat back and waited on God," she said. "I feel very
good about it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Maria Schneider made no sentencing recommendation but
said that she was disturbed by his lack of remorse and his family's
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "The people around him keep telling him what he did wasn't his
fault," she said. "Isn't that another tragedy waiting to happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Ellis Rubin filed a notice of appeal, and the
judge set $5,000 bond for the teenager, who has been free most of the
time since he was charged.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin expected a donor to post bond in a day or two.</TE>

<HD>Environmental Issues No Pushover for Bush</HD>
<DH>Even with GOP holding the House and Senate, president's
goal of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may be
elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even though Republicans will control both houses of Congress,
President Bush will face significant obstacles next year as he tries
to push some of his highest-profile environmental initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's goal of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska for oil and gas development may prove as elusive as ever,
according to environmentalists, lawmakers from both parties, and
their aides.</LD>
<LD>   At least one new Republican senator, Norm Coleman of Minnesota, is
likely to join a pack of seven or eight others who oppose the
president's plan. That's more than enough to offset the Republicans'
slim edge in the new Senate.</LD>
<TE>   And the president's legislative prescription for air pollution
from coal-fired power plants will still face significant and possibly
insuperable opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island probably
will make it very difficult for the president to pass his air
pollution plan out of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Chafee often votes with the Democrats on the committee, turning a
10-8 Republican majority into a 9-9 deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   Chafee supports more aggressive clean-air plans, which, unlike the
administration's, regulate emissions of carbon dioxide. Most
scientists consider carbon dioxide a major contributor to global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that the administration overplays its hand and
tries to dismantle fundamental environmental protections, they're
going to find that the checks are going to come from their own party
and from both houses," said Mark Van Putten, president of the
National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   But while some high-priority legislative changes might remain out
of reach, the Bush administration is likely to find a more clear path
to curtailing environmental regulations. Easier budget negotiations,
less congressional oversight and friendlier courts all will work in
the administration's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger in many of these issues may not be the direct efforts
to weaken laws so much as the efforts to undermine the law by changes
to the budget process or regulatory reforms," said Gregory Wetstone,
director of advocacy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
national environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who sits on the Environment
Committee, said committee Democrats could block Bush with Chafee's
support.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's not going to stop them," she said. "They will find
backdoor ways to get accomplished what they want to get
accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   One way could be through the House-Senate conference committees
that write final versions of legislation after the House and Senate
have acted separately. Republicans will now choose the senators as
well as the House members on those committees, and that could enable
them to insert the president's pet programs into popular bills.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the administration is likely to renew its effort to
exempt the Pentagon from an array of environmental laws. One possible
strategy: Attach these provisions to the annual defense spending
bill, which usually attracts a substantial majority for final
passage.</TE>
<TE>   On some issues, the administration will get its way unless
Congress acts affirmatively to block it. This is notably the case
with regulatory changes -- and here, Congress will have a much harder
time blocking the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Bush took office, for example, the House and the Senate
voted to block the administration from weakening the standard for
arsenic in drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   "When they lost control of the Senate, the Democrats lost this
power," said William Kovacs, a vice president of the U.S. Chambers of
Commerce. "This is the one power that they had that could harm
implementation of administration policy."</TE>
<TE>   Without this tool, Democrats and environmentalists probably will
be unable to kill the Bush administration's effort to give major air
polluters more leeway to meet the requirement that state-of-the-art
pollution control devices accompany significant modifications of
industrial plants.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacs predicted that attempts to stop Bush's plan would not get
far. The big winners will be coal-burning utility plants, which bear
the brunt of the state-of-the-art requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Another avenue open to the administration in the new Congress
involves reducing the budgets for enforcing environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   "If the laws are not carefully monitored and enforced and agencies
aren't funded, the incentives for corporations to fully comply
disappears," Wetstone said.</TE>
<TE>   The election also might help the administration overcome another
important source of resistance to its environmental policies: the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Federal judges have slowed or stopped the administration's efforts
to log national forests, explore for oil and gas in red-rock
wilderness areas and test sonar equipment in the oceans. The
Republican Senate majority increases the likelihood that the Bush
administration will gain Senate approval of its judgeship nominees
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer, who sees herself as one of the primary opponents of Bush's
environmental agenda, said her job has suddenly become much harder.
The administration's environmental actions, she says, will turn the
electorate against Bush in time for the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do everything I can to throw myself in the way of
what they're trying to do; it's going to be very hard," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're going to try to run roughshod over the
environment because they represent corporate interests. I think
they're going to run right into the values of the American people,
and they'll suffer for it in '04."</TE>

said Congress did not give the FCC the power to order what is known
as "video description" when it asked the agency to study the issue of
accommodating the blind.</LD>
<LD>   Under video description, a narrator describes the action during
natural pauses between dialogue.</LD>
<TE>   The description is available on a secondary channel. The FCC had
ordered the four major commercial networks -- Fox, CBS, NBC and ABC
-- to provide 50 hours of such programming</TE>
<TE>   The Motion Picture Assn. of America challenged the rules in court,
claiming the FCC was not authorized to issue them. The appeals court
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "In short, the FCC can point to no statutory provision that gives
the agency authority to mandate visual description rules," the court
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress authorized and ordered the commission to produce a
report -- nothing more, nothing less."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA President Jack Valenti applauded the court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPAA and our member companies support video description on a
voluntary basis," Valenti said, "and we will continue to make
available our filmed entertainment to as wide an audience as
possible, specifically including the blind and those with impaired
vision."</TE>

<HD>Source of Terror Suspect Photos Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon was investigating Friday to find out who took and
released photographs of terrorism suspects as they were being
transported in heavy restraints aboard a U.S. military plane.</LD>
<LD>   Four photographs of prisoners -- handcuffed, heads covered with
black hoods and bound with straps on the floor of a plane -- appeared
overnight on the Web site of radio talk show host Art Bell.</LD>
<LD>   "Anonymous mailer sends us photos taken inside a military C-130
transporting POWs," the headline said.</LD>
<TE>   The photos are the first giving a glimpse into security measures
aboard any of the airplanes used over the last year as suspects were
transferred to prisons in and around Afghanistan and around the
world, including to the high-security prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   It has long been known that prisoners were heavily restrained, and
photos of prisoners bound and kneeling after arrival in Cuba early
this year created a stir among human- and prison-rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   The plane in the latest photos was a C-130, said Lt. Col. Dave
Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman. But it wasn't yet determined Friday
where it was going or when the photos were taken. Officials believe
they were not authorized photos and know their release was
unauthorized, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force and U.S. Central Command were investigating the
breach, said Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very very tight restrictions on any images of the
detainees for security purposes and because we have no interest in
potentially holding detainees up for any kind of public ridicule,"
she told a Pentagon news conference.</TE>
<TE>   It is at least the third time prisoner photos have troubled the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Defense Department has limited the news media in the
kinds of photos it can take of prisoners from the counter-terrorism
war, officials discovered that troops posed for photos with the
American Taliban captive, John Walker Lindh, as he was handcuffed and
wearing a blindfold carrying an obscenity that they had apparently
scrawled across it.</TE>
<TE>   The military itself takes photos for documentation and individual
soldiers often take their own photos as souvenirs of deployments.</TE>
<TE>   In a court motion, Lindh's lawyers also said this year that
unofficial photos and videos of Lindh were taken aboard the
amphibious assault ship Peleliu, where he was confined. Officials
said an officer confiscated cameras and film and erased digital
images.</TE>
<TE>   Also as part of a court filing, Lindh's lawyers released a picture
of him in Afghanistan, blindfolded, strapped to a stretcher and
naked. Defense officials have said that while that photo may have
appeared shocking, he was naked as part of his preparation for
medical treatment.</TE>

<CX>   Terrorism suspects photo -- A photo caption that appeared Saturday in
Section A contained unconfirmed information. The caption said that
the photograph depicted prisoners, who were bound and shackled, being
transported to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. However, as the accompanying
story reported, a Pentagon spokesman said it had not been determined
where the plane was going or when the photos were taken. The photo,
distributed to the media, had appeared on the Web site of radio talk
show host Art Bell with the headline "Anonymous mailer sends us

<HD>Man Sets Marathon Record: 121 Hours</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Lumbering up the last stretch in an antique 130-pound diving suit,
Lloyd Scott finished the New York City Marathon on Friday a full 121
hours after the starting gun was fired.</LD>
<LD>   As workers dismantled the bleachers from Sunday's race, friends
and supporters cheered Scott as he broke through a blue ribbon in
Central Park after having traveled the 26.2-mile course at a turtle's
pace.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, a 41-year-old British citizen and former firefighter who
overcame leukemia 10 years ago, purposefully took on the tortuous and
slow task to raise money for cancer victims and the New York Fire
Department.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm tired but delighted to finish," the tall, broad-shouldered
Scott said, as friends removed the suit's 40-pound bronze helmet.</TE>
<TE>   While Scott's performance was billed as the slowest ever in the
race, marathon officials would only reiterate that the course closes
8 1/2 hours after the start for able-bodied participants and 11 hours
for those with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Scott crossed the finish line a little after noon, five days after
the race got underway. He spent nights at firehouses along the route.</TE>
<TE>   The men's winner, Rodgers Rop from Kenya, completed the route in
2:08:07.</TE>
<TE>   A drained Scott said his trek had been "hard going," especially
climbing the span of the Queensborough Bridge in the lead-weighted
boots.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put on a 130-pound suit and physically try to get up
those inclines, it wears you down a bit," he said. Two friends helped
him along the course, and Scott frequently would pause to rest and
drink water.</TE>
<TE>   The idea came about as Scott tried to think of the most absurd and
challenging way to make a statement about the difficulties of
battling cancer and leukemia while raising money for the charity he
works for, Cancer and Leukemia in Childhood. Along the route, he
raised about $1,000, but returns from the Web site had not been
counted, Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   He also finished the London Marathon this year in the same
deep-sea diving suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It symbolizes the battle of cancer and leukemia sufferers, a
long, slow, painful journey," Scott said, who was joined at the
finish line by his friend and bone marrow donor, Andrew Burgess.</TE>
<TE>   "It might give them some hope, some encouragement to fight their
own personal battles."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said he shed about a "stone," or 14 pounds, during the
marathon, "but I've got plenty to spare." Scott has finished
marathons in about 3 1/2 hours without the gear.</TE>
<TE>   "I've slowed down a little now since I can't break five days," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Chapel to Clear 9/11 Memorial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A chapel that served as refuge for relief workers after last year's
terrorist attacks is trying, as gracefully as possible, to remove
hundreds of spontaneous remembrances left to fade on its iron fence.</LD>
<LD>   St. Paul's Chapel is working to clear the fence of tattered
tributes, 10 feet at a time over several weeks. The church has
promised to preserve them in case a museum wants them.</LD>
<LD>   The fade-out of the memorial began a week ago, even as the church
celebrates the role it played after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World
Trade Center here.</LD>
<TE>   A giant photograph of dust and smoke billowing around the steeple
as the 110-story twin towers across the street fell is affixed to the
front of the church, inviting visitors inside for an exhibit, "Out of
the Dust."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the chapel, visitor Karen Reynoldson of Plantation, Fla.,
looked at wilted flowers, tattered autographed flags and fading ink
on what amounts to a quilt of thoughts and gifts for the living and
the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should leave them here for a while," she said. "I
imagine the New Yorkers are anxious to get it down."</TE>
<TE>   Across the sidewalk were dozens of tables set up by vendors
hawking everything from booklets about the attacks to watches
commonly sold on the street.</TE>
<TE>   The slow dismantling was encouraged by some neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been there over a year now. It's time to move on," said
Clyde Williams, the fire safety director at a nearby building.</TE>
<TE>   He said the fence can ignite painful memories. "I still feel so
bad," he said, "for the people who lost their lives."</TE>

<HD>Seagoing Illegal Migrants Will Face Fast Turnaround</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced Friday that Haitians and others who
attempt to enter the U.S. illegally by sea will be detained and
subject to an expedited process to send them home.</LD>
<LD>   An Immigration and Naturalization Service statement said that even
a perception of rules being relaxed could spur a mass migration that
threatens national security.</LD>
<LD>   "Any message that may encourage a mass migration and detract
federal resources from our homeland defense is unacceptable," the
statement says.</LD>
<TE>   Although Justice Department officials said the move was made under
existing authority, immigration activists said it marked a change in
that most Haitians no longer will be able to go free on bond while
awaiting the outcome of asylum cases.</TE>
<TE>   "This is terribly disappointing," said Cheryl Little, an
immigration advocate in Miami. "Our government is changing the rules
so they can justify discriminatory treatment of Haitians."</TE>
<TE>   The INS statement says illegal migrants will get expedited removal
proceedings and will probably be detained during appeals at the
discretion of the Justice Department. This applies to anyone arriving
illegally by sea except Cubans, who are exempt under a 1966 law.</TE>
<TE>   The statement comes after the Oct. 29 arrival in Key Biscayne,
Fla., of 211 Haitians and three Dominicans who waded to shore after
their boat ran aground. The INS is appealing bonds many were granted,
which would allow them to go free until an asylum hearing is held.</TE>
<TE>   The statement says the intent of the bond appeals and the
administration policy is to discourage mass migration by sea to the
U.S. and to prevent key Coast Guard and Defense Department assets
from being diverted to deal with the arrival of more boats.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says Noelle Bush 'On Track'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A judge Friday told Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter she was "on track" with
drug treatment two weeks after being released from jail.</LD>
<LD>   Noelle Bush, 25, made her first appearance before Circuit Judge
Reginald Whitehead on Friday since serving a 10-day sentence for
violating the terms of her treatment program.</LD>
<LD>   The judge told Bush that he had talked to her case manager and
workers in her drug treatment program.</LD>
<TE>   "Just hang in there and stay focused and do everything you can to
help yourself, not anybody else. OK?" Whitehead said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, the president's niece, is required to appear before
Whitehead every two weeks to report on her progress.</TE>
<TE>   She was ordered to attend drug treatment after she was arrested in
January on charges of allegedly trying to use a fraudulent
prescription to buy the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. The charges could be
dropped if she completes the treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead has since sent her to jail twice for violating terms of
that program.</TE>
<TE>   In July, she was jailed for three days after a treatment worker
caught her with prescription pills. She was jailed again last month
following allegations that she had crack cocaine in her shoe at the
treatment center.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney's office had sought to interview workers at the
center about the allegations, but a judge ruled that doing so would
violate federal privacy laws.</TE>

<HD>Bail Denied for Teen Sniper Suspect</HD>
<DH>Judge orders Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, held at an adult facility.
In another court, John Muhammad is formally charged with capital
crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>FAIRFAX, Va.</DL>
<LD>Sniper suspect Lee Boyd Malvo was ordered held without bond Friday
after a prosecutor said the teenager was seen near three Virginia
shooting sites and that only his fingerprints were found on the rifle
used in some of the deadly attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Fairfax County prosecutor Robert F. Horan Jr. said Malvo, 17, was
spotted in Fairfax, in Prince William County and near a gas station
in Spotsylvania County -- sites where three people were slain during
the October rampage.</LD>
<LD>   Horan also said that only Malvo's prints were found on the rifle
used to kill FBI analyst Linda Franklin outside a Home Depot in Falls
Church on Oct. 14.</LD>
<TE>   Malvo was ordered held at an adult detention center after the
prosecutor said he tried to escape while in federal custody in
Baltimore by breaking through a ceiling and climbing away before
falling into an office.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo, handcuffed and wearing a green jailhouse jumpsuit,
answered, "Yes, sir," when the judge asked if he understood his
rights. Horan said officials are trying to locate Malvo's mother in
Bellingham, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo's court-appointed attorney, Michael Arif, dismissed the
importance of the fingerprints, and said Malvo will plead not guilty.
He also complained that police questioned Malvo for nearly eight
hours on Thursday without a lawyer present.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not at all comfortable with a 17-year-old being in police
custody for that long without police representation," Arif said.</TE>
<TE>   In Prince William County, John Allen Muhammad was formally charged
with the Oct. 9 slaying of Dean Harold Meyers, 53, who was shot while
pumping gas in Manassas.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing leg shackles and an orange jumpsuit, Muhammad stood when
the judge read the charges: two counts of capital murder and one
count each of conspiracy to commit murder and use of a firearm in the
commission of a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit Judge Herman A. Whisenant Jr. asked Muhammad if he wanted
a court-appointed lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I already had counsel," Muhammad replied, referring to
a lawyer appointed by a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said that Muhammad didn't have a lawyer to face the
Virginia charges and again asked him if he wanted one appointed.
Muhammad replied, "I don't know what to say, sir."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he would appoint a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, law enforcement officials said the hard drive of a
Sony Vaio laptop computer found in the Chevrolet Caprice used by the
two suspects contained diary-like files that likely will be used as
evidence against them.</TE>
<TE>   One investigator described the entries as a rambling travel
inventory that provides insight into the suspects' movements before
and during the three-week rampage in the Washington area. But
authorities said the laptop entries did not contain overt references
to the murders or passages that shed clear light on a possible motive
for the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's helpful in the sense that it lets us track what they were up
to," the investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI forensics experts had matched the laptop to a computer stolen
from a Clinton, Md., restaurant owner who was shot six times Sept. 5
as he left his restaurant. A serial number had been partially
scratched off, but investigators were able to connect the laptop to
the restaurateur, Paul LaRuffa, who survived the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   LaRuffa said he was shot moments after getting into his car.
Co-workers saw a man reach into LaRuffa's car and flee with a
satchel. LaRuffa said he lost the Sony laptop and more than $3,000 in
cash receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Sniper task force investigators have run tests to compare the
.22-caliber bullets recovered from the shooting with a handgun
recovered in Montgomery, Ala., near the site of a murder at a liquor
store also linked to the Washington-area killings.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Prince George's County, Md., said Friday they were
"confident" they had linked the Sept. 5 shooting to the suspects, but
refused to discuss the evidence.</TE>

<HD>Antigua Alleges 'Serial Forgery' by Sniper Suspect</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua</DL>
<LD>Nearly 18 months before the national shooting spree, sniper suspect
John Allen Muhammad smuggled his teenage companion into America from
this remote Caribbean island with forged documents identifying the
boy as his firstborn son, according to Antiguan government documents
and official accounts here Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Newly uncovered immigration documents have convinced Antiguan
authorities that Muhammad illegally brought the Jamaican-born Lee
Boyd Malvo into America along with three of his children in May 2001.
Antigua's top investigator of Muhammad's 14-month stay here now says
that trip culminated more than a year of "serial document forgery" by
Muhammad that compromised America's borders and Antigua's
sovereignty.</LD>
<LD>   Detailing the investigation's preliminary findings, task force
chief John Fuller said Friday that two additional Antiguan passports
were issued to foreigners on the basis of documents Muhammad
allegedly forged -- documents similar to those Muhammad used to get
his own Antiguan passport. One of those foreigners and Muhammad also
used similarly forged documents in failed efforts to get a U.S.
passport here, Fuller said.</LD>
<TE>   Antiguan investigators turned over Muhammad's and Malvo's
immigration documents to the FBI on Wednesday. Those records, which
The Times also obtained this week, along with new accounts from key
witnesses here, provide the first solid evidence of the origin and
character of the relationship between the man and the teenage boy
U.S. investigators say terrorized suburban Washington for three weeks
last month before they were arrested in suburban Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Officials speculate that Malvo, now 17, became dependent on the
father figure who made his illegal passage to America possible, and
that Muhammad sought out Malvo after losing his eldest, teenage son
in a bitter custody battle.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller said it was no coincidence that Muhammad used his own son's
name to smuggle in Malvo. Before their departure, Muhammad also is
suspected of forging documents to smuggle Malvo's mother, Una James,
out of Antigua and into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "She [James] obviously left with documents provided by John Allen
Muhammad, probably to get her the hell out of here because he wanted
to have the boy for himself," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Antigua's continuing investigation into the life and times of
Muhammad and Malvo in this island nation reveals that Muhammad easily
won the confidence of strangers, casting himself as a model single
father, while allegedly living a shadowy life as a forger and migrant
smuggler who often traveled alone between Antigua and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad apparently befriended even the police who were guarding
him at the St. John's police station after he was detained at
Antigua's airport on suspicion of trying to smuggle another Jamaican
out of the country. Muhammad simply walked out of the station on
March 13, 2001, while the police corporal on duty wasn't looking.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller described the Muhammad who lived here as "a charismatic
character who easily inveigles his way into a person's good graces
... very well educated in psychological obfuscation ... a very, very
clever man."</TE>
<TE>   "This man," he added, "had a suitcase of different aliases,"
beginning with the one he used when he landed on this island
thousands of miles from home.</TE>
<TE>   The strange saga began on March 27, 2000, when Muhammad, who was
then legally named John Allen Williams, picked up his three children
from his ex-wife's home in Tacoma, Wash., promising to return them
the next day, according to court documents in Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, however, Muhammad and his two daughters and son
landed not at their Tacoma home but at Antigua's V.C. Bird
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration documents show that Muhammad entered Antigua as Thomas
Allen Lee on American Airlines Flight 5502 from San Juan, Puerto
Rico. He produced a Wyoming driver's license and a Pennsylvania birth
certificate; both documents apparently were forgeries.</TE>
<TE>   For his children -- Taliba, Salina and John A. Williams Jr. --
Muhammad produced forged birth certificates from Illinois, Michigan
and Alabama identifying them as Theresa, Lisa and Fred Allen Lee.
Muhammad signed all of their immigration arrival cards "Thomas Lee."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen months later, in handwriting nearly identical to Lee's,
John A. Muhammad signed the departure cards for the children under
their real names.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying the four on that flight was a Lindbergh Williams,
whose name, birth date and birthplace were identical to those of
Muhammad's real son from an earlier marriage, according to the
immigration documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely certain that Lindbergh Williams is Malvo,"
Antigua's Atty. Gen. Gertel Thom, who is coordinating Fuller's
investigation, told The Times in an interview this week. "Lee Malvo
clearly entered Antigua in 1999, and we have not been able to find
any record of Lee Malvo ever leaving the country under his real
name."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have determined that Lindbergh Williams was with his
mother in Louisiana at the time. The boy has had only limited contact
with his father since Muhammad lost a 1995 custody battle for
Lindbergh, according to relatives in Louisiana and court documents in
Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   Although Antiguan investigators are still trying to determine how
Muhammad and Malvo met, they are certain it was here -- sometime
during the 14 months they were foreigners in a small, inviting and
accommodating foreign land.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what is certain from witness accounts and the documents
investigators have unearthed so far:</TE>
<TE>   On his arrival form on March 28, 2000, Muhammad stated his
profession was "car repair." His nationality, he declared, was "Black
American," the same designation he listed for his children.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Kellman, an Antiguan and the cousin of one of Muhammad's
friends in Tacoma, picked them up at the airport that day and housed
them for five weeks. Two weeks after their arrival, Muhammad enrolled
the children at Greensville Primary School -- a weathered, wooden
schoolhouse with a rusted tin roof that caters to Jamaican immigrants
in St. John's. He paid about $170 in tuition for each.</TE>
<TE>   During the fourth week of their stay, though, Kellman recalled in
an interview, Muhammad told her he was returning to Washington "to
get some money" and would be back soon.</TE>
<TE>   "After he left, I was speaking to the children and some
information that I got from them, I realized that something was
wrong," Kellman, who knew Muhammad and his children by their real
names, said in a radio interview with an Antiguan station. When
Muhammad called from Washington, Kellman told him "he better get a
flight back right now."</TE>
<TE>   "There are things that he is hiding from me and I didn't like
it.... I accused him of stealing the kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad promptly returned, and Kellman promptly kicked them out.</TE>
<TE>   The four then moved into a clapboard house the size of a trailer
on concrete blocks beside the Greensville school. They sublet from a
Jamaican couple, Charles and Dolly Douglas, and slept on the floor.
They had no running water, and there were a dozen adults and children
living there, the children's teachers and roommates later recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "They were lovely children: respectful, nice and very smart,"
recalled one of their teachers, Muriel Allen Bennet. "And he was a
wonderful father. He came into the school three times a day just to
check up on them."</TE>
<TE>   Greensville's founder and principal, Janet Harris, agreed. Harris
was so taken in by Muhammad's charm and fatherly way that she later
lied to support his successful application for an Antiguan passport
and in a letter recommending Muhammad to potential employers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known John Williams Sr. [Muhammad] for one year and seven
months and have found him to be an honest and trustworthy young man
who possesses certain attributes that make him very likable and easy
to get along with," Harris wrote in the letter, dated just two months
after she met him.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad, she added, "tends to illuminate his environment with his
pleasantness and extroversion. He adheres to high moral and religious
principles that will certainly help him to cope with the various
challenges in his personal and employment life."</TE>
<TE>   He applied for a job with the Antiguan government's Sports
Ministry, submitting photocopies of diplomas showing that he had a
bachelor of science degree from Southern University and A&amp;M College
in Baton Rouge, La., and a master's degree in physical education and
science from Louisiana State University. Accompanying them was a
letter allegedly from LSU's track and field coach stating that
Muhammad was an "exceptional" assistant coach for a year there.</TE>
<TE>   "P.S. If you don't want to win, don't hire this man," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the time, ministry officials suspected they were
forgeries, which investigators say they have since confirmed. They
asked Muhammad to return with the originals. He never came back.</TE>
<TE>   Antiguan investigators say they have found no record of legitimate
employment for Muhammad here. Rather, they allege his occupation was
providing forged U.S. birth certificates, driver's licenses and other
documents for Jamaicans and other migrants seeking to enter the U.S.
illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Kithlyn Nedd lived in the house beside Greensville school for much
of the year Muhammad lived there. Nedd, whom Fuller praised Friday as
a highly credible witness, said in an interview that he has provided
investigators with the names of several Jamaicans he believes
Muhammad smuggled into America. Among them: Una James, Malvo's
mother.</TE>
<TE>   That contradicts the account Malvo and his mother gave to
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents after they were
detained as illegal migrants last Dec. 18 in Bellingham, Wash. They
told the INS that they were smuggled into Miami on a freighter from
Haiti in June 1999. But investigators said immigration and school
records here document that Malvo and his mother lied to the INS about
their arrival -- most likely, they say, to protect Muhammad's role in
it.</TE>
<TE>   Those Antiguan records show that Malvo's mother arrived here from
the Jamaican capital of Kingston on Jan. 15, 1999, on a Jamaican
passport issued to her a month before. She then sent for her
13-year-old son, who arrived in Antigua in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1999, James enrolled her son in the 10th grade at St.
John's Seventh-day Adventist School and paid the school fee of $230.
The boy attended regularly until "he just disappeared" one day two
weeks before Easter break in 2001, according to the school's
principal.</TE>
<TE>   The principal, who asked not to be identified by name, described
Malvo as "a very good student." "He was an outspoken child. He wasn't
a bit reticent. He would express opinions without being rude."</TE>
<TE>   His mother's movements in Antigua are still much of a mystery. To
obtain her work permit, James stated she was a maid for Simon
Peterson, an Antiguan sea captain who has since died. Several
witnesses also said she worked as a street vendor.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone who knew her or the boy agreed she had left the
island well before he did.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew his mother was no longer with him" by then, the principal
added. "She had left him with somebody here in Antigua."</TE>
<TE>   Nedd said that "somebody" was Muhammad. He said Malvo and Muhammad
met near the house beside the primary school, a 15-minute walk from
Malvo's school. He and other witnesses in the neighborhood said the
two were seen together for about two months before all of them
disappeared from the island.</TE>
<TE>   "John [Muhammad] already fixed up some documents for his [Malvo's]
mother to leave Antigua, sometime in 2000, about like in October,"
Nedd said. Friday, Fuller said his investigators are poring over the
records for some 5,000 passports issued while Muhammad was in
Antigua.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Thom said investigators have been examining thousands
of departure documents to determine how James left Antigua for the
U.S. Immigration records show no legal departure for her or her son.</TE>
<TE>   But police and immigration logs already have convinced Fuller and
his task force why they all left on May 31, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was detained at Bird airport on March 11, 2001, after he
checked in for a flight to San Juan under a false name, Dwight
Russel. Police suspected he was attempting to smuggle a Jamaican
named Howard Kelly out of Antigua, and they held Muhammad at the St.
John's police station for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Muhammad simply walked out of the station. Fuller
said Muhammad left the island soon after under another assumed name,
and on April 23, Muhammad appeared in a Tacoma courtroom to change
his name to Muhammad. Then, immigration records show, he returned to
Antigua as John Allen Muhammad on May 25.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, he packed up his possessions at the crowded
clapboard house, loaded them in a taxi and flew off to San Juan and
points beyond with his three children and a boy who assumed the
identity of his son.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NASA's workhorse spacecraft Galileo made a final flyby of Jupiter's
moon Amalthea in what is expected to mark the end of the
science-gathering portion of its 13-year mission.</LD>
<LD>   NASA officials said Galileo flew within 99 miles of Amalthea, a
brilliant red, egg-shaped moon, then swung closer to Jupiter than it
ever has before. The team plans to crash the probe into Jupiter in
September.</LD>
<LD>   Galileo gathered measurements of the energy fields and charged
particles in the inner region of Jupiter's magnetic environment. It
also examined dust grains that form a gossamer ring around the
planet. The probe placed itself in a standby mode after its closest
approach to Amalthea, however, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory
controllers will have to reactivate it to retrieve all of its data.</LD>
<TE>   Galileo has made 37 close encounters with various planets,
asteroids, and Jupiter's four large moons since it was launched 13
years ago.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gay sheep that mate only with other rams have different brain
structures from "straight" sheep, a finding that may shed light on
human sexuality, researchers said. Differences are similar to those
in some homosexual humans, but probably go only a small way to
explaining causes of different sexual orientations, an Oregon Health
&amp; Science University team said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not trying to explain human sexuality by this study,"
physiologist Charles Roselli said. "Whether this is a big component
of what contributes in humans, that's still debatable."</LD>
<LD>   Working with a team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sheep
Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho, Roselli's team studied 27 sheep
-- 10 ewes, nine rams that mated only with other rams and eight rams
that mated only with females.</LD>

<LD>   Nervous system injuries are hard to heal because brain and spinal
cord cells lose the ability to grow new links as they mature. The
enzyme chondroitinase was applied to a part of the rats' brains,
allowing the cells to break connections and rewire them, said
neuroscientist Tommaso Pizzorusso of Italy's University of Florence.</LD>
<LD>   Chondroitinase unravels a net of proteins around the connections,
which may allow nerve cells to reattach after damage from accidents,
stroke or disease. Spinal cord injuries affect 250,000 people in the
U.S., while strokes affect about 4.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers "are among those who have taken the first crucial
step" toward finding a way to heal such injuries, Kevin Fox and Bruce
Caterson, neuroscientists at Britain's Cardiff University, wrote in
an accompanying editorial.</TE>

<HD>Lady Lizard Found to Lord It Over Males</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the eternal war between the sexes, the lady side-blotched lizard
wins it all: She selects her many mates, decides where they'll live
and even determines if they will have sons or daughters. Virtually
every element of the mating and reproductive cycle of the small
American lizard is controlled by choices made by the female,
according to UCLA biologist Ryan Calsbeek.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the ultimate example of a female having her cake and
eating it too," Calsbeek reported in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. "It would be like a human female who marries a
short, dumpy rich guy and then has an affair with a muscular
20-year-old to have a handsome son who grows up in a mansion and goes
to the best schools."</LD>
<LD>   The side-blotched lizard is the most common lizard in the American
West. It lives among rocks west of the Rocky Mountains from Canada to
the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. The animal is small -- with the male
reaching about 2.3 inches and the female about half that -- but it
has a complex mating and reproductive system, Calsbeek said.</LD>
<TE>   Generally, the female picks the mate she'll live with. Calsbeek
said he and his co-author observed that the female generally prefers
a big male who lives on a big rock in the best location.</TE>
<TE>   To see whether the female was selecting the choice living site or
the choice male, the researchers moved the rocks around, putting the
big males on poor rocks and the little males on the best rocks in the
finest neighborhoods. The female lizards seemed to prize comfort over
all else, choosing small males with the fancy rocks as the first mate
and live-in partner.</TE>

<HD>A Salute to My Son, the Soldier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Diaz</AU>
<BD>Sue Diaz is a writer in San Diego. E-mail:
sue@suediaz.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"No, not like that, Mom. Like this."</LD>
<LD>   I'm standing in the family room, and my 6-foot-1 son is teaching
me how to salute. I note how the tips of Roman's fingers lightly
touch near his eyebrow. How his hand, wrist and forearm form a nice
straight line that angles in sharply at his elbow. With his arm
lifted like that, I can't help but also notice how the waistband of
his boxers billows above the belt loops of his hip-hugging jeans.</LD>
<LD>   I try again. "Better," he says, nodding.</LD>
<TE>   A booklet he brought home a few days ago, compliments of the local
Army recruiter, lies open on the coffee table. In it are things every
new recruit needs to know, including whom to salute, and how.</TE>
<TE>   My son is a new recruit.</TE>
<TE>   He has much to learn. And, I'm afraid, so do I.</TE>
<TE>   We're not a military family, though my father was proud to have
served in the infantry in World War II. We're no more patriotic than
most. Not particularly political either. So how did our son come to
enlist? A combination of things. Both he and his older sister, now a
senior at Stanford, were raised with the phrase "when you go to
college." But last year, Roman, 18 and headstrong, decided he didn't
want college, at least not right after high school. He'd work instead
at the firm where he was a part-time Web designer.</TE>
<TE>   When that company folded after he graduated, Roman decided to move
to a city 100 miles away with a buddy. Life would be his classroom.
But he found that particular course harder than he ever expected.
After 9/11, jobs were scarce for self-taught Webmasters in baggy
jeans. So he made ends meet -- barely -- with odd jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you thought any more about college? Your dad and I would
help with that, you know," I said on more than one occasion when he
came home for a weekend visit. But he was determined to make it on
his own.</TE>
<TE>   And so, in his quest for independence, my maverick son has joined
forces with Uncle Sam. His lease up, his enlistment papers signed,
Roman's back at home before heading to basic training in Ft. Benning,
Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning over coffee I unfold the newspaper and debate
whether to read the Iraq stories. Before now, I'd read news of
conflicts in the Middle East and other parts of the world, but that
was when the term "troops" was just another word in the headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Now, that word has a face, and that face belongs to someone I met
for the first time 18 years ago in a hospital delivery room. That day
I looked into my newborn son's eyes and thought about all that life
might hold for him. Foxholes on the outskirts of Baghdad were not on
the list.</TE>
<TE>   It's the day before he's scheduled to leave. Taking a break from
packing up stuff in his room, Roman shuffles over, plops down beside
me on the couch. Without preamble, he lays his head on my shoulder.
He hasn't willingly done this since maybe the third grade. I slip an
arm around him, press my lips against his bristly hair.</TE>
<TE>   Today, our family's private D-Day has arrived. Roman strides down
the hall, his backpack slung over one shoulder. He puts it down to
say goodbye. At the front door, he and his dad hug in that
self-conscious men-who-know-each-other-well hug. Then it's my turn. I
wrap my arms around his waist, my tears mottling the T-shirt he just
ironed.</TE>
<TE>   "Love you," I blubber.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, too, Mom," he whispers.</TE>
<TE>   He turns, picks up his backpack. My husband and I follow him and
his sister, who's driving him to the pickup point, out to the car at
the curb.</TE>
<TE>   Roman slides in on the passenger side. Just before he closes the
door, he looks over at his dad and me standing together in the yard
where he used to play hide-and-seek, and my eyes meet his.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, I lift my hand, wrist and forearm in a nice straight
line, making sure the tips of the fingers of my right hand lightly
touch near my eyebrow. With a crooked smile, Roman returns this
salute. Then, facing straight ahead, my soon-to-be-a-soldier son
looks toward a future that none of us in this new world can be sure
of.</TE>

<HD>High School Curriculum Should Be More Relevant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Classes that are rigorous, interesting and relevant for all high
school students are urgently needed in Los Angeles schools. KAREN
KARLITZ recently spoke with CAPRICE YOUNG, president of the board of
the Los Angeles Unified School District, about changes in that
direction that are taking place.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   We don't have high enough expectations for our high school
students. Many of our kids, particularly in inner cities, do not
receive the rigorous course work they need to either go to university
or to enter a career after high school.</LD>
<TE>   Currently most school districts, including Los Angeles Unified,
make the assumption that students will not be going to college.
Students get courses needed to graduate, not necessarily those
required for college. Many parents think that because their kids get
A's they are on a university track. Then in their child's senior
year, they discover the college-required courses have not been taken.</TE>
<TE>   Creating school-to-career programs is another way to save our high
school students. These programs focus on the core curriculum of a
career direction chosen by the student. They excite students about
academics and decrease the dropout rate.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, we already have multimedia programs that graduate
students with artistic, technical and communication skills. When
creating a digital film, students write scripts, think logically and
use math and visual skills, but it's interesting to them because
they're making movies. We also have a partnership with the local
police and firefighting academies.</TE>
<TE>   Creating more personalization is essential. Almost all of our high
schools have at least 3,600 students. Each school should be divided
into smaller groups of 500 students or less so that students can be
treated as individuals with aspirations and goals. A good example is
a student who wants to be an electrician. Electrician apprenticeships
require algebra, a college prep course. Vocational training should
provide the academics needed to achieve the chosen job goal.</TE>
<TE>   In some of our schools there is more cosmetology being taught than
algebra or chemistry, and that's not good. I'm not saying cosmetology
isn't important -- after all, this is Los Angeles -- but we need to
make sure our kids are in an environment that will hold their
interest. That means tying academics to life.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes students say they must leave school to help their
families, a legitimate problem. But if the students see the
connection of education to their future earning power and personal
goals, they usually stay in school.</TE>
<TE>   We have committed ourselves to creating a system of public
education to raise human beings who will be active, successful
participants in society. It is illogical to lock our students away
from the community for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   We've had an entrepreneurial movement for change by some
innovative teachers, administrators and community leaders that has
been quite successful. Now it is time for the revolution to become
the institution.</TE>

<LD>Jarrod loved to slip away from his full-time aide and run to the
office of his favorite staff member at the Speech and Language
Development Center in Buena Park. His disabilities rendered him
unable to speak coherently, but he would stand next to her desk,
mumbling, until the aide found him there.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, the center's instructors taught Jarrod not to wander.
Now he can be relied on to stay in one place -- even outside the
office door of that beloved staff member, without walking in.</LD>
<LD>   No big deal? That's not how Jarrod's family sees it. Jarrod's
newly mastered ability to stay put provides them with freedom they
could scarcely imagine before: They can take Jarrod, now 18, out for
a pizza or burger, knowing he won't break away.</LD>
<TE>   The Speech and Language Development Center is among the nonprofit
organizations receiving funds from the Los Angeles Times Holiday
Campaign. Despite the center's name, tutoring children with language
disabilities is just a part of its mission. More than 200 teachers,
therapists and aides work with about 300 youngsters from Los Angeles
and Orange counties whose disabilities and disorders put them beyond
the help of most schools. Long before a study in October proclaimed
autism an epidemic, an increasing number of families were going to
the center for help with the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the students, who range in age from 6 months to 21 years,
have multiple disabilities that turn the simplest learning task into
a heavy burden. When some of them reach the end of a line in a book,
they need special help to bring their eyes to the beginning of the
next line.</TE>
<TE>   Will arrived at the center when he was an underweight 2-year-old
with several disabilities related to his premature birth. He needed
vision services, social coaching, speech therapy. After 10 years at
the center, he went on to regular high school and earned his diploma.
"It felt like a doctorate to us," his mother said.</TE>

<HD>A Chill on Patients' Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patients want to trust their doctors. Few demand a second opinion,
even if they ought to, when a specialist says a surgical procedure is
necessary to head off an imminent heart attack. That's what adds such
a chill to the stories out of Northern California about cardiologists
being investigated for performing risky but possibly unnecessary
heart procedures that effectively bolstered their paychecks. So do
the questions about whether hospital administrators could have turned
a blind eye to possible medical wrongdoing in the name of profits.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI, which is conducting an investigation, has filed no
charges against the doctors, Chae H. Moon and Fidel Realyvasquez Jr.
Their employers, Redding Medical Center and its parent,
Santa-Barbara-based Tenet Healthcare, have not been named targets of
investigation. But it's the sort of tale that resonates with patients
because of the intense cost and profit pressures on managed-care
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation into the coronary-care unit and Medicare
payments it generates for the Redding hospital is just part of the
story. Red flags appeared late in October after a Wall Street
health-care analyst questioned the overall heavy reliance on Medicare
payments at Tenet, one of the nation's largest hospital companies.</LD>
<TE>   The federal Department of Health and Human Services then said it
would audit Tenet's receipt nationwide of special Medicare payments
that are designed to help hospitals defray financial losses from
difficult and invasive procedures. Worried investors quickly fled,
Tenet's share price took an abrupt nose dive and the company's chief
operating and chief financial officers unexpectedly resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Patients can't help worrying about collisions between medicine and
profit, because their very lives are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   It's bad enough to think of doctors performing unnecessary
procedures for their own gain. It's even worse if the push for
profits could combine with a poorly designed and badly monitored
Medicare payment program to create an environment that encourages
fraud or gaming the system.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare administrators, state regulators and law enforcement have
to find out quickly what, if anything, went wrong at Tenet. They also
should analyze similar payments to other companies and, if necessary,
tighten oversight.</TE>

<HD>Clear U.N. Message to Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council's 15-0 vote Friday to dispatch weapons
inspectors to Iraq and give Saddam Hussein "a final opportunity" to
disarm represented a triumph for diplomacy and a clear warning to
Baghdad. The Bush administration accepted compromise to meet the
concerns of its allies. France in particular raised objections but
also listened to Washington. Iraq should understand that the Security
Council resolution that emerged from the debate leaves it cornered;
if Saddam Hussein wants to spare his country more devastation, he
must open the door to the weapons inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   As so often happens at the United Nations' headquarters, the
debate was lengthy and the phrasing arcane. But eight weeks of
negotiations, three draft resolutions and a final one-word change --
substituting the word "and" for "or" -- produced unanimity. A "no"
vote or an abstention by any one of the 15 council members could have
emboldened Iraq to believe that not all countries were exercised by
its refusal to comply with previous U.N. resolutions demanding that
it allow in weapons inspectors and reveal its weapons of mass
destruction. Syria's "yes" vote even undercuts Iraqi claims that the
U.S. is on an anti-Arab campaign.</LD>
<TE>   France pressured the United States into agreeing that it will be
the U.N. weapons inspectors, not Washington, who will decide whether
Iraq has failed to comply with the resolution. The United States
agreed that if such a failure occurred, the Security Council would
debate possible action. Washington insisted that it retain the right
to wage war against Iraq even without U.N. approval, but now the
claim generates less foreboding.</TE>
<TE>   The debate began with many nations as worried about the Bush
administration's unilateralism as about Iraq. President Bush eased
some concerns when he stopped emphasizing "regime change" in Baghdad
and said the goal was Iraqi disarmament. British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Bush's main ally, said after the vote that Hussein's regime
was "abhorrent" but could survive if it disarmed.</TE>
<TE>   The final resolution is tough, as it must be in dealing with a
nation that has twice invaded neighbors and has used chemical weapons
against its own citizens. The U.N. document demands that Iraq grant
inspectors unrestricted access to buildings, including presidential
compounds, in their search for chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq might still refuse to admit inspectors, as it has since 1998.
Even if the inspectors return, Iraq may keep insisting that it has no
weapons of mass destruction. If it drops that pretense and identifies
weapons development sites, months could be required to visit them
all. The resolution is therefore only a step toward taming Iraq, but
it confirms the United Nations' important role in keeping the peace
or waging war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush challenged the organization in a speech to the General
Assembly Sept. 12 that launched the dialogue on Iraq. U.N. members
listened to him; in return, the United States heeded their concerns
during the weeks of negotiations. The outcome strengthens and
validates international cooperation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Caught in a Jobless Free Fall," Nov. 1: Speaking from my actual
experience as a former unemployed aerospace engineer over 50 years of
age, I must say that if unemployed professionals apply for retail
jobs at low pay, at a large discount store or at the neighborhood dry
cleaner, they will usually be rejected. The interviewer will say, "If
you work here at much less pay than you made before, won't you soon
leave if someone offers you a higher-paying job?"</LD>
<LD>   The result is that high-paid executives, engineers, accountants,
etc., cannot get low-paid jobs in retail. The employers, for their
own self-interest, rightly favor people who have experience in retail
work at lower salaries. Employers also prefer people younger than the
typical 50-year-old unemployed manager. The one area that seems to be
open to older unemployed professionals is the job of a security guard
in a bank or supermarket shopping center.</LD>
<LD>   I talked to a security guard at a mall who was a former aerospace
engineer. An unarmed security guard job pays $8 an hour and is very
boring.</LD>
<TE>   The reality of long-term unemployment of professionals is actually
a hidden story that is much worse than described in your article.
Most unemployed older professionals either retire if they can afford
it, go on welfare (if they can), work as a consultant or open their
own retail business if they have the capital to do it. They generally
cannot get low-paid jobs in nonprofessional fields such as retail or
factory work.</TE>

<TE>   It is very easy to find a job by going door-to-door in a business
area. I have successfully followed this procedure four or five times
in my life since 1969.</TE>
<TE>   All you have to do is say, "Hello, do you know where I can get a
job?" You don't even have to speak with an owner or manager; the
staff employees almost always know where you can find a job.</TE>
<TE>   If you are skeptical, I'd just like to explain that during the
summer of 1969, when I asked for a job as a computer programmer at a
bank in Milwaukee, the receptionist told me that the telephone
company was hiring. After five or six interviews and six or seven
weeks, I began work at the Wisconsin Telephone Co. as an assistant
analyst.</TE>

<TE>   Jewish Vocational Service, a 71-year-old, nonprofit, nonsectarian
agency that helps people hone their professional skills and craft
their careers, with services from 13 locations in L.A. County, has
seen the effects of the "jobless recovery" on Angelenos from all
walks of life. Although the unemployment rate for the nation remains
at 5.7%, that figure jumps in Los Angeles. In the last year, more
than 13,000 people have turned to JVS for job help, a 50% increase
from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   While a typical JVS client used to be a blue-collar worker or
person with barriers to employment (including refugees and
immigrants, people with disabilities and at-risk students), we are
now seeing more and more white-collar workers, including people with
years of managerial experience or new MBAs. Some former donors to JVS
have become clients. Recent graduates especially, expecting the
inflated salaries of the '90s boom, are disappointed at the realities
of today's marketplace and are now accepting entry-level jobs at
one-third the salaries their older classmates earned just a few years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   To address the needs of unemployed white-collar professionals and
recent graduates struggling in this tough economy, JVS introduced a
series of workshops called FasTrak University. Aimed at providing an
advantage in a dire job-seeking environment, the workshops provide
interactive coaching in identifying and marketing one's unique
capabilities, networking creatively and landing project work to stay
busy and gain experience.</TE>
<TE>   The response has been so overwhelming that JVS is expanding the
program through next year. For more information, visit www.jvsla.org

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Class Size Is a Big Issue for Teachers," Nov. 5: As class size
grows to the extent that children are sitting on top of trash cans,
learning diminishes. How can our children feel valued when they are
trying to learn under these conditions? Perhaps the L.A. Unified
School District board is preparing us for the "No Child Left Behind"
law passed in 2001, under which only "highly qualified" teachers will
be in front of children by 2005. Of course, it's unlikely that 5,000
fully certificated teachers will be knocking down our doors, so it's
more likely our children will be taught by substitutes while new
teachers are becoming fully prepared. In my experience, no teachers
are really highly qualified until their fifth year of teaching.</LD>
<LD>   There is an elephant in the room, and we won't make progress until
we deal with it. Students are expected to learn in overcrowded
classes while Eli Broad and former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan pull
the strings from their lofty regions behind several school board
members. We cannot lose district board member David Tokofsky. If that
happens, I'll vote for the breakup of the LAUSD in a heartbeat.</LD>

<TE>   How can anyone, with a straight face, claim that class size
doesn't matter for learning? Common sense tells you that cramming 50
students in a room with one teacher and expecting the teacher to
teach, rather than simply engage in crowd control, is absurd. If
small classes aren't crucial to instructional effectiveness, why
don't private schools have large classes? After all, more students
mean more tuition.</TE>

<TE>   My son attends Frost Middle School. At the beginning of the
semester I complained to his counselor when I learned that he was
sitting on the floor for one of his academic subjects. Your article
quotes one assistant principal as stating that the stress is "a
little higher." As a teacher in the LAUSD with a classroom of 20
children, I have to insist that the stress upon these teachers has
got to be overwhelming. Add to that the LAUSD's mania to document
English language development and other assessments and the problem of
lost instruction time further diminishes the possibility of real
learning taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer doesn't understand what tough economic
circumstances are. Try teaching children who don't have a shower or
bath in their apartments, or who sleep doubled in a bed, or worse,
lack a bed. Cut out the mini-districts. Save the salaries, rent and
unnecessary paperwork that they are producing. Cut out the new board
building. Let them work in crowded rooms, on old furniture, with
dirty bathrooms and poor-quality cafeteria food. Don't tell the
teachers "we have to manage our way through this." We know what
really matters; we spend our lives teaching children. They are the
only thing that matters.</TE>

<TE>   As a new resident, I was appalled when Californians spoke
disparagingly of their public school system, which at one time was a
model worthy of emulation by the rest of the nation. Your article
gives the rationale for this dismal view as it depicts overcrowded
classrooms and underpaid, overworked teachers coping with problems of
discipline and with teaching common human courtesies, when they
should be devoting their time to the job of transferring civilization
from one generation to the next. Education is big business, and it
requires big funding, the benefits of which are realized only after
the students have completed their education and established their
vocations. Frugality may be a virtue, but excessive penuriousness in
funding public schools can be a formula leading to disaster.</TE>

<HD>Gioia's Nomination to Arts Agency Matters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In noting poet and critic Dana Gioia's nomination for chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, Bill Press (Commentary, Nov. 3)
challenges Gioia's assertion that L.A. has produced no great poet by
adducing Charles Bukowski. There is no doubt Bukowski has written
memorably of L.A. -- but when the issue is greatness, I doubt many
would agree with Press. By quoting that dreadful pablum beginning
"Nobody can save you but yourself," he unwittingly defeats his own
argument -- though, in Bukowski's defense, it must be allowed that no
poet is always at his best.</LD>
<LD>   Gioia (whom Press refers to twice as "Danny Gioia") and Bukowski
agree on a matter of greater significance: the importance of
California poet Robinson Jeffers. Gioia has repeatedly championed
Jeffers, in principled opposition to the neglect of the "academy,"
and Bukowski is on record in both poetry and prose in acknowledging
his debt to Jeffers.</LD>
<LD>   Gioia's influential article "Can Poetry Matter?" made waves that
still have not subsided more than 10 years later. Press says that
nobody much cares whether Gioia wins confirmation. Thoughtful
Californians will.</LD>

<LD>Re "Prognosis Doesn't Look Good for Acclaimed Rancho Rehab Center,"
Nov. 1: The old county poor farm -- yes, that is how the now
world-renowned Rancho Los Amigos facility began in the 1880s. It was
a working farm with cattle, sheep and pigs, as well as vegetables and
flowers. The residents able-bodied enough to work became the
caretakers of the farm. There was also a train line through the
grounds to pick up passengers as well as products for sale. At one
time, there even was a zoo and an aviary.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next 100 years, "the Ranch" went through numerous
historical moments: early care of the mentally ill, the polio
epidemic, massive use of the "iron lung." All the while, the mantra
was to get the best use of what you have remaining after a
devastating physical or mental insult. Rancho was where I spent the
major part of my professional career as a nurse anesthetist. I lived
through so much Rancho history, seeing firsthand the invaluable work
done for babies with birth defects, for spinal injuries, for severe
arthritics and on and on. I worked with the finest people in the
world, trying to find ways to make life better, where the Ranch was
the last hope. It seems incredible that Rancho should even be
considered for closure. We must find the means to carry on the
pioneering spirit that is the Ranch.</LD>

<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am appalled and saddened by the proposal to close Rancho Los
Amigos. Having worked there for 16 years in various capacities I saw
the remarkable success of the rehabilitation programs conducted by
creative, committed professionals in partnership with patients who
had severely disabling conditions including strokes, spinal cord
injuries, arthritis and head injuries. What will happen to these and
future patients if Rancho ceases to be? The "indigents" who make up
one-third of those served by the center are primarily working people
who cannot afford health insurance. These people will therefore be
left powerless to survive, rediscover a place in their culture, make
a contribution and find something worth doing in the face of
lifelong, severe, disabling conditions. Many will end up dying
untimely deaths because of inactivity, while others will become
lifelong residents of nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   In a compassionate, ethical society, every life is precious. We
should not have to make a choice between acute medical care and
rehabilitation for our citizens. The proposal to close Rancho
underlines the crisis in our entire health system in which so many
people are left vulnerable because they cannot afford health
insurance. We are one of the few industrialized countries in the
world that fails to provide health care for all of its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho has been a significant source of knowledge and know-how for
rehabilitation all over the U.S. and in the rest of the world. It is
a leader in educating physicians and other health-care workers in the
newest and best ideas and technology to help restore people to
equality of capability. Many might believe that this "is nice but it
doesn't apply to me." However, with increasing longevity, many of us
will have disabling conditions. The knowledge generated by Rancho
might be personally essential just as it is no longer available. I
urge our county, state and federal officials to seek a comprehensive
solution to our health-care crisis and rescind the vote to close
Rancho Los Amigos.</TE>

<TE>   In "Seniors See a Doctor Shortage" (Nov. 4) you report that
Medicare's low reimbursement rates are not the main reason why
doctors are reluctant to take on new Medicare patients and point out
that there are other reasons as well, including the "paperwork
hassles, complex billing codes and a 'paranoia' about being accused
of 'fraud and abuse.' " For many physicians, their unwillingness to
take on Medicare patients is prompted more by this second group of
factors than it is by the money issue.</TE>
<TE>   Many physicians are fed up and worn out by having to waste
precious time and energy on nonmedical tasks and worrying about being
accused of not complying with the many regulations that are
strangling them. Some doctors see every new patient taken on as a
bundle of nonmedical, time-consuming and mind-numbing hassles.
Doctors must be allowed to practice medicine unimpeded by the
ever-increasing encroachment of guidelines and regulations, made
worse by the fear of being prosecuted for fraud. This applies not
only to Medicare patients but to all patients.</TE>

<LD>Re "Uncertainty Shadows Starlight," Nov. 3: People who ride the
long-haul Amtrak trains either love them or are fed up with them.
Admittedly, my family's Amtrak trips are usually part of an annual
vacation excursion, though many fellow travelers obviously regard the
train as the only mode of interstate transportation that they'd
consider. My aged aunt and uncle, as a typical example, only
considered visiting family in the San Fernando Valley from the
Midwest when offered train tickets on the Southwest Chief, having
ruled out driving and jetliner travel. Many senior citizens rely on
Amtrak because they simply consider the skies off-limits.</LD>
<LD>   Having ridden the Coast Starlight and many other Amtrak long-haul
trains, I can promise you the food and service are usually excellent
and the ambience superior in this most civilized way of travel.</LD>
<LD>   Keep the cheap air tickets to Seattle; I'll pay a bit more (maybe
less if the trip is to a smaller city otherwise requiring expensive
connecting flights) any chance I get to indulge in the national
treasure of a scenic, sociable and civilized Amtrak excursion.</LD>
<TE>   Greg Potenza</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article was most timely. I just returned from a trip on the
Southwest Chief. The main problem is trying to carry passengers over
tracks maintained for freight. Passengers and train staff must be
ever vigilant lest they fall from the jostling.</TE>
<TE>   Railroads found passenger service not as profitable as freight,
but the Interstate Commerce Commission required the railroads to
continue passenger service. To convince the ICC that there were no
passengers interested in rail travel, they let the service
deteriorate to where passengers stayed away in droves. The marginal
track bed and service is what Amtrak inherited.</TE>
<TE>   Following WWII, the Marshall Plan rebuilt Europe and its rail
service. President Eisenhower determined we needed a modern
interstate highway system for "national security." Why not a modern
rail system for our national security as in Europe? We deserve super
train service too. Rail travel would once again be popular, with
modern, fast trains that kept a schedule, using their own rails.
Sleeping compartments would be popular if they were larger. To
perpetuate the present discredited service will lead to the end of
passenger service, which would be a tragedy.</TE>

<HD>Young Voters Want Steak, Not Just Sizzle</HD>

<LD>As a 40-year-old returning student, I feel that Steven Hill and
Rashad Robinson (Commentary, Nov. 5) came very close but, in the end,
missed the mark as to why more young people do not vote. Young people
I encounter do cite irrelevance as a contributor to not voting, but
the core reason is more elemental: Politics, like commerce, has
become more about marketing and spin than about accuracy and merit.
Politicians are selling sizzle to an audience long aware that there
is little or no actual steak.</LD>
<LD>   If we want our young people to participate, then we'll have to
acknowledge some bitter truths and implement some bitter pills:
Capitalism (and I'm a conservative) has outstripped democracy; real
campaign reform is long overdue. Advertising is not the same as
information; candidate debates must be mandatory. Our two-party
system has become a single, collusive Republicrat Party; integrate
third parties into the political dialogue and media coverage.</LD>
<LD>   It's my experience that young people are not lazy or apathetic. In
fact, just the opposite: They are contemptuous of a system that
loudly talks the talk but is no longer willing to sweat walking the
walk of a real representative democracy.</LD>

<TE>   One of the suggestions to improve voter turnout is to fine those
who don't vote (letter, Nov. 5). While this is a good idea, I believe
I have a much better plan. First, 75% of eligible people must be
registered to vote. Second, 75% of the registered voters must
actually show up at the polls. If either of these conditions is not
met, then the election results become null and void. Every office
that was up for grabs would remain empty until the next election,
with incumbents being allowed only to finish out their terms.</TE>
<TE>   If the selection of governor is not important enough to get people
to vote, the obvious conclusion is that the people don't want or need
a governor. Fine, let's give them what they want. The same thing
holds true for bond measures and initiatives -- if a majority of the
eligible population doesn't think it is important enough to vote for
or against, it is by definition not important.</TE>

<TE>   No wonder voting turnout is so low. This is the second year in a
row that I have had to cast a provisional ballot because my
registration materials were not recorded at my polling site. I showed
up at 9 a.m. at the Rose Hills Recreation Center, where I cast a
provisional vote last year despite having registered in plenty of
time for that election.</TE>
<TE>   This year it was no longer a polling place. "Try Huntington
Elementary," staff there suggested. At Huntington Elementary, my
address was not listed. Poll workers were helpful but couldn't read
the precinct maps and sent me to a polling place on Collis Avenue. At
Collis Avenue they told me that on my side of the street, we vote at
Via Arbolada. Finally, at the Via Arbolada polling place, I was in
the right spot. My name was not listed even though I sent my
registration materials six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sending in my registration again today. This will be the third
time in two years that I have attempted to register at the same
address. Throughout the two-hour odyssey, I had my 3-year-old
daughter with me. Each time we left a polling site, she'd shout, "But
I want to vote!" So did I.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Nonvoters Express Disgust at Political System," Nov. 6: Maybe
it is time to keep this type of story out of the paper. People who do
not vote do not have a voice in our country. Why should the paper
give them one? I am tired of cynics complaining about everything. The
complaints count only when you vote. And I cannot help remembering
how the people on United Airlines Flight 93, on Sept. 11, voted
before taking action against their attackers. This is America and we
vote here. We ignore those who do not vote.</TE>

<LD>Re "Say So Long to Serendipity," Commentary, Nov. 3: Thank you for
the new view on the contradictory liaison between the average
American's ignorance and illusive omniscience. I am now a student at
Biola University in La Mirada, but I spent my entire life and school
career in Germany as an American/German dual citizen. I have been
somewhat surprised, but even more disappointed, at the unawareness
with which most Americans, in this Information Age, respond to
anything outside their own little world.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get me wrong. Germans are not much better. They are fed
Hollywood's TV shows like "Baywatch," "Beverly Hills 90210" and
"Friends" and think that these are the American way of life and that
U.S. citizens follow those stereotypes. But I think that a
significant predicament in our society today is the ignorance of the
true issues and foundations upon which worldviews are built. We are
ready to accept and agree to the aspects of reality that fit in with
our own personal views on life, but we do not leave any room to
expand our horizons and critically analyze the world around us in
pursuit of truth and reality.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Names 4 Countries Hiding Smallpox Virus," Nov. 5: During a
biology class discussion about vaccinations (at San Jacinto High
School) I was surprised to find that quite a few of my students
reported that they had been inoculated for smallpox and had the scars
to prove it. More than one student told me with authority that the
presence of the scar is how they can tell if a Mexican American was
born in Mexico or the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   I remember trying unsuccessfully to get my own children vaccinated
for smallpox in the '80s. Maybe a trip south of the border is in
order for my adult children.</LD>

<HD>Early Morning Crash Kills Pilot, Jams Santa Ana Canyon
Commute</HD>
<DH>Family members say aviator was a Temecula man. Power lines
are cut over the Riverside Freeway, but no outages are reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small plane slammed into a hill in Anaheim early Friday, killing
the pilot, snapping power lines and snarling the morning commute on
the Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities did not immediately identify the man found in the
wreckage of the single-engine Cessna 150E, but family members
identified him as Dennis Beitel of Temecula, a licensed pilot
qualified to fly in bad weather. Coroner's officials said they may
have to use fingerprints to make an official identification.</LD>
<LD>   The burgundy-and-white plane was spotted about 4:40 a.m. by a
motorist who reported seeing the low-flying craft pass over the
westbound lanes of the freeway at Gypsum Canyon Road. Seconds later,
the driver said he saw sparks light up the predawn sky.</LD>
<TE>   Rescue crews and firefighters searched in the rain and thick fog,
but could not find the wreckage in the darkness, said California
Highway Patrol Officer Katrina Lundgren.</TE>
<TE>   At daylight, searchers found the crumpled plane about two miles
from where the motorist reported it. The plane, which was folded into
a crevice in the hillside about 50 feet above the freeway, was
visible to motorists and slowed traffic to a crawl for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the pilot was flying alone from Temecula to the
Fullerton Municipal Airport, generally following the path of the
Riverside Freeway when the plane clipped the power lines.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot lost control and hit a hill near Coal Canyon Road, said
Maria Sabol, spokeswoman for the Anaheim Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   A chunk of the aircraft was found on the right shoulder of the
freeway. Investigators have not determined what caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation
Administration are investigating and will inspect the wreckage next
week after the plane is trucked to a facility near Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots are required to use instruments when visibility is less
than three miles and cloud cover is less than 1,000 feet. At the time
of the crash, it was raining, cloudy and winds were blowing at 11
mph, forecasters said. Visibility was 1 1/2 miles and the cloud cover
was at 800 feet, said Noel Isla, a forecaster with the National
Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison crews were repairing and replacing
transmission lines still dangling above the freeway late Friday.
Crews planned to close the freeway early this morning to complete
their repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The crash caused no electrical outages, although lights flickered
in Corona about the time of the crash, said Steven Conroy, spokesman
for Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   According to records, Brenda Benbow of Temecula purchased the
plane in 1999. Family members said that Beitel, who holds a
commercial pilot's license and was instrument rated, was the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very good man," said his daughter, Stacey Beitel, "and
he loved to fly."</TE>

<HD>Raymond F. Dasmann, 83; a Founding Father of
Environmentalism</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Raymond F. Dasmann, whose research and writings about threats to the
natural world helped mold the modern environmental movement, died of
pneumonia Tuesday in Santa Cruz. He was 83 and had been in declining
health for several years.</LD>
<LD>   Dasmann was a UC Berkeley-trained field biologist who began
talking about the need for environmental conservation in the late
1950s, almost two decades before the concept took hold in the
American mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   Although not a household name like Rachel Carson or Jacques
Cousteau, he is considered a luminary of environmentalism whose
intellectual contributions include the concept of "ecodevelopment,"
or sustainable development, the idea that a community's progress
should not rely on exploitation of its natural resources.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of the great pioneers in trying to keep the human
environment habitable and sustainable," Paul R. Ehrlich, a Stanford
University biologist and author of the landmark 1968 book "The
Population Bomb" who considered Dasmann one of his heroes, said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The author of more than a dozen books that include two classics of
the conservation movement, Dasmann was respected for his global
vision and insistence that ecological solutions include a central
role for indigenous cultures.</TE>
<TE>   His 1965 book "The Destruction of California" was a call to action
that became a staple of university ecology courses in the 1970s.
Coming three years after Carson's "Silent Spring," it was, said
Ehrlich, "a pioneering monument in what was soon to be an explosion"
of books on ecology.</TE>
<TE>   Although in frail health, Dasmann produced two memoirs in his last
few years: a 232-page oral history published by the University of
California Press last year; and "Called by the Wild: The
Autobiography of a Conservationist," published in April.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote a highly regarded textbook, "Environmental
Conservation," originally issued in 1959 and now in its fifth
edition.</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann coined what he called the first law of the environment.
"No matter how bad you think things are," he often said, "the total
reality is much worse."</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann was born in working-class San Francisco, the son of a
police sergeant. His brother worked for the state Department of
Forestry and helped spark Dasmann's interest in the natural world.</TE>
<TE>   He was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley when World War II erupted,
sending him into the Army and service in Australia and New Guinea.
During the war, he met Australian painter Elizabeth Sheldon, to whom
he was married for 52 years, until her death in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   He resumed his education after the war, eventually earning his
bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from UC Berkeley, where he
studied under the eminent wildlife biologist A. Starker Leopold.</TE>
<TE>   As a graduate student, Dasmann studied deer populations in
Northern California, a topic that acquainted him with the
complexities of environmental politics. Finding that the population
of deer was growing far faster than their range could support,
Dasmann and his colleagues argued that a doe hunt was necessary to
restore balance. But they failed to convince deer hunters, who feared
it would lead to extinction and ruin their sport.</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann received his doctorate in 1954, then taught at Humboldt
State University and later UC Berkeley. In between, he studied
African wild game as a Fulbright field biologist in what was is now
Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Dasmann entered the policy arena, first as an ecologist
for the Conservation Foundation in Washington, D.C., then, beginning
in 1970, for the International Union for Conservation of Nature in
Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   He began studying environmental issues from a global vantage
point, traveling to hot spots in Africa, Sri Lanka and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the few American scientists ... and practically the
only one of his generation, to look globally and locally" at
environmental issues, said Randall Jarrell, who directs the Regional
History Project at UC Santa Cruz and interviewed Dasmann for the oral
history.</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann returned to California in 1977 to teach ecology at UC
Santa Cruz. He was an active professor until his retirement in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrell, who called Dasmann the Darwin of the ecological movement,
said Dasmann insisted that ecologists learn from the indigenous
peoples living in threatened environments.</TE>
<TE>   "In a national park, the first thing we do is get rid of the
people," Jarrell said. "He said, 'These people have been living here
for thousands of years; let's let them be the stewards.' His
inclusion of human beings into this equation of conservation biology
is one of his greatest contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann's overriding message remained constant over the last three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we must restore the sense of individual responsibility
and involvement, and get away from the idea that conservation is the
responsibility of somebody else -- the federal government, the state,
the corporations, the rich," he told Whole Earth magazine last year.
"We need to look at our patterns of consumption and behavior and shed
those practices that contribute to the destruction of nature. This is
incredibly difficult to do in a society oriented toward consumption,
material enrichment and waste."</TE>
<TE>   He once built his own house -- a humble structure in the foothills
of the Sierra -- but he was the first to admit that he was no paragon
of conservation; he confessed, for instance, that he drove a
gas-powered car.</TE>
<TE>   He characterized himself as "a tentative optimist" about the
future of the world who found hope in the success of organic farming
and related movements. But in his last days, the pessimist may have
been winning the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Allayaud, legislative director of the Sierra Club in
California, met him by chance a few days before his death while
visiting his mother in the same nursing home. He told Dasmann that he
worked for the Sierra Club and that the group was waging difficult
battles.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'So many struggles, so many struggles,' and began to
cry," recalled Allayaud. "It was hitting him ... the really long,
hard road we have to fight. I told him, 'I know why you're crying.' I
said, 'We will continue to fight.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dasmann is survived by three daughters, Marlene and Sandra Dasmann
of Santa Cruz and Lauren Chamberlain of Tucson; five grandchildren;
and one great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Tijuana Trying to Redeem Its Reputation</HD>
<DH>A committee and its hard-working director meet regularly to
find ways to polish the image of a border town with a tawdry past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne-Marie O'Connor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pity the poor city of Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Since Prohibition put it on the map, Tijuana has been known for
drinking too much, partying too late, and embracing hedonistic
strangers. But like an aging wild child, it wants to be known for
more.</LD>
<LD>   Tijuana is trying to change its image. If the city pulls it off,
it will be its biggest reinvention since a Tijuana nightclub dancer
named Margarita Cansino morphed into sultry Hollywood legend Rita
Hayworth.</LD>
<TE>   Behind the effort to improve public perceptions is the Tijuana
Image Committee, which meets regularly to strategize how to showcase
things the city would rather be known for: restaurants with
inexpensive nouvelle cuisine, an internationally recognized modern
arts scene, and the manufacture of more television sets -- 8 million
a year -- than anywhere else in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The committee invites foreign press members to events like the
unveiling of a monument to victims of Sept. 11. It invited sculptors
worldwide to loan some 60 sculptures that have been erected on
Tijuana avenues. The committee backs things like the cleanup of
Tijuana's iconic Avenida Revolucion, where shopkeepers are being
warned to stop displaying drug-smoking pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the perception of the city to be the real one: a city of
industry, of hard-working people who have found something here that
was denied to them where they came from -- opportunity," said Jose
Galicot, president of the Comite de Imagen.</TE>
<TE>   It was Galicot who persuaded Tijuana to run from Mexican producers
who wanted to set a soap opera, "Tijuana," in the city in 1998. Drug
cartel violence was already earning the place comparisons to Al
Capone's Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Televisa producer Raul Arauza protested that 20 movies about
Capone "didn't ruin Chicago's reputation." But he conceded defeat
when city officials protectively registered Tijuana as a trademark.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana's image make-over has made city leaders, once known for an
exuberant lack of self-consciousness, touchy and circumspect.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had enough of the identity of the city and its inhabitants
being soiled because of a foreign group," said a letter from Mayor
Jesus Gonzalez distributed at a U.N. development conference in
Monterrey.</TE>
<TE>   But the road to redemption is never easy. And for Tijuana, it's
been a minefield.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana's most recent indignity is a radio hit by French pop
singer Manu Chao with the Spanish-language chorus of "Welcome to
Tijuana, tequila, sex and marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   There was the attempt to curse Tijuana with an area code, 666,
whose numerology engendered Satanic connotations. Officials demanded
reassignment. Tijuana got 664.</TE>
<TE>   There are still jokes at Tijuana's expense over its mayor's summer
flirtation with a now-fizzled proposal to join in sister cityhood
with Medellin, Colombia -- a place known as the General Motors of
cocaine cartels.</TE>
<TE>   A Medellin link would have brought a lot of baggage for a city
whose leaders have tried to persuade U.S. journalists and Mexico City
officialdom to replace the term "Tijuana drug cartel" with the more
geographically vague "Pacific cartel."</TE>
<TE>   Even Mexican President Vicente Fox has slipped, invoking the
"Tijuana cartel" in a speech a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   One thing all the notoriety has generated for Tijuana is name
recognition. And after all, it was "Miami Vice" that restyled that
beige city of sunbaked retirees into a sin-baked pastel kingdom of
cool.</TE>
<TE>   Galicot realizes Tijuana's electric ambience has its own risque
Wild West charm. He's not trying to turn Rita Hayworth into Doris
Day. He just wants to inject some propriety into the aura of a city
whose brothel-strewn past is referred to locally as a "black legend."</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the change of image is self-esteem," Galicot said.
"People here have to accept that they are in an excellent city."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Tijuana is lucky.</TE>
<TE>   People don't talk much anymore about the 1994 assassination of
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, which took place in a
Tijuana slum under still unexplained circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles," Galicot said. "They
killed JFK in Dallas. A city is not defined by a crime committed
there."</TE>
<TE>   But Tijuana was also tainted by the gangland murders of drug
prosecutors in the mid-1990s. It was during that tumultuous era that
Galicot began his campaign by painting flowers and butterflies on
freeway overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   His 20-member Comite de Imagen debuted at the 1996 Republican
National Convention in San Diego, buttonholing reporters and
generating what he estimates were 25 positive articles about Tijuana
in the U.S. press.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was quickly overshadowed by the kidnapping of a
Japanese businessman. Such setbacks -- often tied to drug feuds --
still dog the image effort. There were the two state policemen found
dead in a car trunk last month, covered with blood and dollar bills.
There was the young woman's head discovered this month in a bag at a
shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   But no one ever said this would be easy.</TE>
<TE>   And Galicot, 65, who says his father was once a croupier at a
Monte Carlo casino, seems uniquely well-suited to the ups and downs
of his task.</TE>
<TE>   Galicot came to Tijuana as an 8-year-old with his family from
Chihuahua in 1946. He arrived well after the city's Prohibition
heyday. When he was a boy, the nightclubs and bordellos were filling
up with a less-glamorous clientele: U.S. servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up to become the owner of Tijuana's most famous disco, the
"OH!" It was a swinging hot spot Galicot modeled on Studio 54 and is
mentioned in sealed U.S. court files as the place where drug lord
Ramon Arellano Felix got into a fistfight over a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone went there," Galicot shrugged, "the good and the bad."</TE>
<TE>   Don't think the image campaign has gone unnoticed. Even academics
have waded in.</TE>
<TE>   "If Tijuana is to be a catalyst for the emergence of the
binational region," wrote Lawrence Herzog, a member of the executive
committee of the Institute for International Security and Conflict
Resolution, "then it must first overcome its own negative image."</TE>
<TE>   And Tijuana's image is changing. A recent PBS documentary cast it
as a hip post-modern destination. Newsweek magazine effusively
baptized Tijuana (along with post-Taliban Kabul) as one of the
world's "culture meccas."</TE>
<TE>   Galicot's Image Committee has swelled to 120 members. He plans to
get artists to paint 15 new murals. Galicot would like to see a
Tijuana "Walk of the Stars" to commemorate onetime residents like
Carlos Santana.</TE>
<TE>   He is even pushing a proposal to create a bilingual tourism police
composed exclusively of female officers, who are believed to be less
likely to shake down American visitors for bribes.</TE>
<TE>   Because, while it's important to change outdated stereotypes,
Galicot acknowledged, "You can't change an image without changing
reality."</TE>

<HD>Rudolf Augstein, 79; Der Spiegel Founder and Chief
Editorialist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rudolf Augstein, who founded the progressive German newsweekly Der
Spiegel, which rose to prominence in post-Nazi Germany on the
strength of its investigative reporting and its acerbic political
commentaries, died Thursday in Germany of pneumonia. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   The magazine's publisher and chief editorialist until his death,
Augstein was born in Hanover, where he began his journalism career as
a trainee on a local newspaper. In 1941, he was drafted into the
German army and was wounded on the Eastern Front.</LD>
<LD>   Released from combat, he went to Hamburg in 1945, and began
working for a British-owned newsweekly magazine. In 1947, at age 23,
Augstein took over as editor and publisher, and renamed it Der
Spiegel, which means The Mirror.</LD>
<TE>   Augstein soon became known as a fierce critic of West German
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who governed the country after World War
II. Augstein's most dramatic moment as a publisher came in 1962,
during Adenaur's term, when he published an article that questioned
West Germany's military readiness in case of a Soviet nuclear attack.</TE>
<TE>   Augstein was charged with treason and spent 103 days in jail
before the charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence. The
incident became known as the "Spiegel affair" and cemented Der
Spiegel's reputation as a beacon of the free press. It also led to a
loss of confidence by many Germans in Defense Minister Franz Josef
Strauss, who had accused Augstein. Not long after the case was over,
Strauss resigned from office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Augstein spent a few months as an elected member of the
West German parliament before he quit and went back to publishing.
Four years later, he married his fifth wife, Anna Marie Hurtgen, who
survives him along with four children from his previous marriages.</TE>

<HD>George Salyer, 101; Held World Records as Oldest Skydiver,
Pilot</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>George Salyer, 101, a record-setting skydiver who was jumping well
past the age of 90, died in a house fire Sunday in Everett, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   A retired Boeing Co. worker, he held the Guinness Book of Records
title of world's oldest male skydiver in 1994. He also was proclaimed
the world's oldest male pilot, and had been flying since his first
solo stint in the cockpit in 1935.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1901, two years before the Wright brothers' historic
flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., Salyer was a machinist for Boeing until
his retirement in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   The owner of 17 planes during his lifetime, he took up skydiving
at the age of 88. He became a skydiving enthusiast, observing each
subsequent birthday by jumping from altitudes of about 12,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, when he was 91, he became the oldest male tandem skydiver
in the world. In 1995, Salyer, then 94, and a 71-year-old son, a
40-year-old grandson and a 15-year-old great-grandson set a record
for a multigenerational jump.</TE>
<TE>   He continued making jumps until a few years ago, when his tandem
skydiving partner quit for health reasons, his daughter, Jo Salyer,
told the Everett Daily Herald.</TE>

<HD>Bernard Carroll Jr., 83; Engineer Built Eternal Flame at
JFK's Grave</HD>

<LD>Retired Army Col. Bernard G. Carroll Jr., who created the eternal
flame that marks President Kennedy's grave in Arlington National
Cemetery, died Sunday in La Jolla from complications after heart
surgery. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll was the post engineer at Ft. Myer, Va., when Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963. When First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy made the
request for the flame -- she remembered seeing one in France that she
thought would be appropriate for the president's grave site --
Carroll was given 48 hours to design and build it.</LD>
<LD>   Using the Maryland phone book, Carroll trolled hardware stores in
search of the gas and copper tubing he needed for the project. He and
his crew worked through a day and a night to rig the apparatus, which
has been renovated many times over the years.</LD>
<TE>   Carroll was uniquely suited to the task. In the Army, he did
weather reconnaissance for a meteorology station in North Africa,
which he commanded during World War II. After the war, he worked as a
junior partner in a construction firm.</TE>
<TE>   When Carroll reenlisted as an Army engineer during the Korean War,
he helped renovate the key port of Inchon, for which he was awarded
the Legion of Merit.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll spent 29 years in military service, retiring to El Cajon,
Calif., where he taught high school at Mount Miguel High School for
10 years. He later joined the faculty of Grossmont College.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Bette; three daughters; two sons; and
six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Former Camarillo Teacher Pleads Guilty to Molesting 11
Teens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Camarillo High School teacher pleaded guilty Friday to sex
crimes involving students, admitting he molested 11 teenage boys over
two years.</LD>
<LD>   Nine of those sexually assaulted by Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 31,
were students at Camarillo High when he taught upper-level science
and coached boys' tennis and soccer. He met two other boys in an
Internet chat room.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting at the defense table with his head bowed and speaking
softly, Pridgen pleaded guilty to 20 felony and misdemeanor charges
and no contest to three of the 39 charges he initially faced.</LD>
<TE>   Charges include allegations that Pridgen supplied teenagers with
alcohol, had oral sex with minors, showed them pornography and
behaved lewdly in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the sex acts occurred at Pridgen's Camarillo home,
where the teacher frequently had students over for after-school and
weekend parties.</TE>
<TE>   He is to be sentenced Jan. 17 in Ventura County Superior Court,
and faces a maximum of 13 years in state prison. He remains free on
$500,000 bail until sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley, who accused Pridgen of using
his authority as a teacher to take advantage of teenage boys,
stressed that Friday's action was not the result of a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very pleased with the result," Ridley said outside court.
"We felt this spared the victims having to testify without
compromising anything."</TE>
<TE>   The father of two victims said he was relieved to see Pridgen
admit to the charges after six months of delayed hearings and
seemingly little progress.</TE>
<TE>   He said the case has torn the family apart and will hurt long
after Pridgen is sentenced. "I want my boys to be able to stand up
and let him know how they feel," he said. "It's not just us -- this
has hurt a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorney, Paul Takakjian, did not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen is also named in a lawsuit that seeks millions of dollars
in damages from the Oxnard Union High School District, where he was
employed as a teacher and coach for six years before his arrest Feb.
5. Seven teenage boys and their families have accused school and
district officials of ignoring complaints brought against Pridgen at
least two years before he was charged with molesting students.</TE>

<HD>Globalization a Challenge for Ethicists</HD>
<DH>Critics fear it threatens native cultures, speeds
environmental decay, widens rich-poor gap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when billions of dollars move between continents in an
instant and workers half a world away produce goods sold in the local
hardware store, religious thinkers increasingly ponder whether their
traditions can impose an ethic on globalization.</LD>
<LD>   Globalization affords new opportunities and a higher standard of
living for some, religious critics say. But they worry that it
threatens indigenous cultures, accelerates environmental destruction
and widens the gap between haves and have-nots.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic figures have been among the most active in debating the
role that religion can play in shaping globalization.</LD>
<TE>   The billion-member church has a worldwide reach, a hierarchical
structure and adherents in both rich and poor countries, all of which
positions it uniquely to observe and experience globalization's
impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the church is trying to stop it. I think they're
trying to shape it, direct it," said Father Bryan Hehir, executive
director of Catholic Charities U.S.A. He was a key figure in the
development of major pastoral letters that the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops delivered in the mid-1980s on the economy and
nuclear armaments. Last week, he spoke in Los Angeles at a forum on
globalization hosted by Loyola Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   The key for the church, he said, is to try to temper the
disruptions that rapid globalization can cause. "You can't create
international integration at the price of social disintegration,"
Hehir said in his speech to the forum.</TE>
<TE>   The ethical implications of globalization were raised last year by
Pope John Paul II in addressing the Pontifical Academy of Social
Science, which met in Rome to consider globalization. Globalization,
the pope said, "enshrines a kind of triumph of the market and its
logic."</TE>
<TE>   The trend brings rapid changes to social systems and cultures, the
pope said. "Many people, especially the disadvantaged, experience
this as something that has been forced upon them, rather than as a
process in which they can actively participate," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Ethical values cannot be dictated by technological innovations,
engineering or efficiency; they are grounded in the very nature of
the human person," the pope said. "Ethics demands that systems be
attuned to the needs of man, and not that man be sacrificed for the
sake of the system."</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles forum, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony echoed the
pope's words. "Globalization, a priori, is neither good nor bad. It
will be what people make of it," Mahony said. But he cautioned that
globalization, like other systems, must serve "the human person" and
the common good.</TE>
<TE>   Religious concern for the poor and social and economic justice is
not new, of course. But globalization poses unprecedented challenges.
Moral teachings have not kept pace with fast-breaking developments on
the world economic front, critics of globalization say.</TE>
<TE>   "In this area it is a little bit like bioethics," Hehir said.
"We've done medical ethics for a long time in the Catholic Church,
but we're confronting a set of questions today that our predecessors
never experienced. It is that way with globalization."</TE>
<TE>   The problems caused by globalization are not limited to other
nations, speakers at the forum said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said Los Angeles is not only a global city but a
"globalized" one. The five-county Los Angeles metropolitan region is
shaped by the economies of the United States, Latin America, and the
Pacific Basin. Wages, working conditions, migration and prices are
all influenced by globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these issues brings with it a moral component, he said.
For example, he said, some Southern Californians are coming to
realize that the bargain prices they pay for clothes, toys or
electronics "are possible only because they exact a great price from
workers who produce them" around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Our social teaching is unwilling to relinquish responsibility for
economic systems ... to the 'invisible hand of the market,' " he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony and Hehir both said the church begins with a preferential
option for the poor. "That's the dominant note," Hehir said in an
interview. A second note is support for creating new international
institutions or strengthening existing institutions like the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, so the rights and dignity of
individuals are protected.</TE>
<TE>   The international market is the only one not regulated by an
overarching political authority, Hehir noted. Without such
safeguards, the good that comes from globalization may not be equally
distributed.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Mahony put it, "jurisdiction gaps" prevent existing
institutions from adequately responding to the challenges of global
markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Globalization, like the dramatic advances in technology and
medicine, needs to be given moral direction by women and men of
goodwill," Mahony said. "Globalization must be made to serve the
essential dignity of every single human person."</TE>
<TE>   More than a century ago, the Vatican responded to sweatshop
conditions, the use of child labor, unemployment and poverty wages
with Pope Leo XIII's encyclical "Rerum Novarum," which put the
church's influence behind the drive for workers rights.</TE>
<TE>   But much work remains before the church can have a similar impact
on globalization. The Catholic view of the phenomenon and ability to
offer credible guidance is still developing, Hehir said.</TE>
<TE>   Globalization poses new and different challenges than did
industrialization. "It's a much more complex process. It isn't just a
variation. It is an extension far beyond," Hehir said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can move billions of dollars around the globe today. We
couldn't do that before, for good or ill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The church, he said, must develop a new competence on issues such
as trade, the role of transnational corporations and the workings of
the international financial system. It must consider how it should
think ethically about the flow of capital in an interdependent world.</TE>
<TE>   "Controls or not controls? What kind of controls? These are
empirical questions," Hehir told the forum, "but they have moral
content."</TE>

they're trying to shape it, direct it."</CP>

<HD>Bishops and Abuse Crisis: Buck Stops Where, How?</HD>
<DH>Most Catholics say they are angrier about the cover-ups
than about the molestations. Accountability will be a big issue for
conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's Catholic bishops gather here starting Monday for their
annual meeting, during which they will consider changes in their
policy on sexually abusive priests and discuss their own
accountability.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary report to be delivered at the conference will come
from a special committee responsible for deciding how bishops can be
held more accountable to each other and to their flocks.</LD>
<LD>   The accountability question has hindered the bishops' attempts to
move beyond the church's sex abuse crisis. Many lay Catholics are
angry that bishops who allowed the problem to fester have not
resigned or have not been disciplined.</LD>
<TE>   In a June poll, 96% of Catholics said the pope should "take
disciplinary action" against a bishop who allowed abuse to continue.
In September, 61% of Catholics said they were more disturbed by the
cover-ups than the abuse itself.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Robert Brom of San Diego, chairman of the seven-member
panel, said he does not foresee new rules or penalties for bishops
who abuse their power or mishandle a crisis. Instead, Brom said, he
envisions guidelines for more informal -- perhaps private -- rebukes
among the bishops.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility would be to empower the church's 33 geographic
provinces to confront errant bishops within their borders. The
archbishop of Boston, for example, has limited supervision over six
other bishops in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final policy, Brom said any discipline or reprimand
would encompass aspects of "fraternal support, fraternal challenge
and even fraternal correction."</TE>
<TE>   Brom said the last 10 months have reminded the bishops that their
influence extends well beyond their church walls.</TE>
<TE>   "Holding ourselves and each other accountable is one thing, and
that's important," he said. "But in doing so, we don't want to
diminish the accountability beyond ourselves to the church and to
society."</TE>
<TE>   When the bishops approved new get-tough regulations on sex abuse
in June, they did not address how or whether negligent bishops should
be held accountable. They quickly pointed out that the only person
who can remove or discipline a bishop is the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Brom and others on the committee want to find avenues for the
bishops to show "tough love" to other bishops who abuse or fumble
their authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The delicacy is how do you do that?" said Auxiliary Bishop Jerome
Listecki of Chicago, a member of the panel. "You have to do it
without being intrusive, without trying to make decisions for that
bishop, because that's certainly out of the purview of any of the
bishops."</TE>
<TE>   Lay groups say they are outraged that negligent bishops remain in
office. Linda Pieczynski, spokeswoman for the Call to Action group,
said the bishops' policies are more offensive than the abuse itself.</TE>
<TE>   "People get upset at the priests who did the violation ... but the
real anger is reserved for the bishops who allowed it to happen and
to be repeated over and over again," she said. "That has not been
addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the church can ever move beyond the scandal while
negligent bishops remain in office, Brom demurred. "Do we all think
there have to be better systems of accountability? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   He said he will present his committee's initial findings to the
full house of bishops next week, but he said those bishops probably
will not make any final decisions until their meeting in June.</TE>
<TE>   Other panel members are Cardinal Francis George of Chicago,
Archbishop William Levada of San Francisco, and Bishops John Kinney
of St. Cloud, Minn., Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh and Samuel Aquila of
Fargo, N.D.</TE>

<DL>WALTHAM, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholics and Jews should continue to work to heal divisions
between the two religions as a way to foster world peace, a Vatican
official said this week.</LD>
<LD>   "To heal this wound, a wound which is still open ... is a
contribution to peace in our world," said Cardinal Walter Kasper, the
Vatican's top official working for reconciliation with Jews.</LD>
<LD>   "There cannot be peace in the world without peace among
religions," Kasper said. "Jews and Christians have to become allies
in the world today."</LD>
<TE>   Kasper made his remarks during a meeting at Brandeis University,
part of a brief visit to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, relations between Catholics and Jews have been
marked by "many, many dark points," Kasper said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Jews and Catholics have clashed over Pope Pius
XII and his alleged failure to raise his voice against the Holocaust.
Vatican officials vowed this year to release World War II-era
documents that they said would shed a better light on Pius' wartime
actions.</TE>
<TE>   But Kasper said the two religions also could work together to
solve new challenges, including terrorism and xenophobia.</TE>
<TE>   He commended Americans for helping improve Christian-Jewish
relations.</TE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II is sending emergency aid to the dwindling Catholic
population of the Holy Land with an appeal to all Christians to
remain like heroic missionaries in "these tormented places," the
Vatican said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop Paul Josef Cordes, president of the Pontifical Council
Cor Unum, will distribute $400,000 to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem,
the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land, Caritas and Catholic
communities.</LD>
<LD>   The funds were collected in an appeal the pope made after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon for
aid to victims of war and terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   "The support is offered to better the conditions of life and work
in their land in order that it may be a fertile seed of humanity and
peace," the council said.</TE>
<TE>   "The continued acts of violence between Palestinians and Israelis
represent, unfortunately, a persistent threat to the life of all the
inhabitants of the region," the council said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, it said, "Houses of hospitality for pilgrims are
empty while unemployment in Bethlehem has hit some 80% of the
population. One can well understand, therefore, the desire of many to
leave the country."</TE>
<TE>   But the council warned that a Christian exodus would seriously
endanger the safeguarding of holy places. It said the Palestinian
occupation of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem for 39 days
last April and May "gave further proof of how necessary is the
presence of Christians in the Holy Land."</TE>

<HD>Oil Firm to Sell Stake in Sudan Over Criticism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talisman Energy Inc., a Canadian oil firm, has bowed to pressure from
Christian organizations and human rights activists and agreed to sell
its stake in a Sudanese oil project.</LD>
<LD>   World Vision and other Christian groups were leaders of an
international campaign to push Talisman to leave Sudan. The groups
have claimed that the company has been generating hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue for Sudan's Muslim-led government,
which they accuse of widespread human-rights abuses against
non-Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Talisman's chief executive officer, Jim Buckee, said the company
could no longer support the pressure its Sudan operations put on its
resources and share price.</LD>
<TE>   "It was time to turn the page," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every newspaper mention of Talisman was qualified under 'involved
in Sudan.' We hope to move on from that instant association."</TE>
<TE>   Buckee maintained that the Muslim government's exposure to a
democratic perspective and its engagement in the world economy
through oil exports forced it to use some restraint in its civil war
against rebels in Sudan's oil-rich southern region, most of whom are
animists or Christians.</TE>
<TE>   But, despite financing many schools and hospital beds in Sudan,
Talisman Energy became a lightning rod. Critics who have dogged the
company for more than three years, urging a boycott of its shares,
praised the news as a triumph for human rights.</TE>

<HD>Liberal Groups Call for Reforms in Abuse Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Catholic bishops need to revise their policies on sexual
abuse and come clean about how many abusive priests are in each
diocese, two liberal Catholic organizations said.</LD>
<LD>   One group, Call to Action, called on the bishops to disclose how
many children have been abused by priests and how much each diocese
has spent on legal settlements.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to galvanize Catholic laity to take responsibility for
our church," said Call to Action spokeswoman Linda Pieczynski. "If we
do, then we can ensure that our children are protected, that our
money is spent wisely, and that our church leaders are open and
accountable to us."</LD>
<TE>   The National Coalition of American Nuns, a group of about 1,800
Catholic sisters, said it cannot support the bishops' current draft
sex abuse guidelines because a "zero tolerance" policy does not fit
all cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not support any guidelines that make no distinction between
confirmed pedophiles and rehabilitated offenders, or between offenses
committed in the distant and recent past," the nuns' statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops will meet next week to
revise the sex abuse rules after the Vatican ordered changes.</TE>
<TE>   The nuns said the current charter features a "lack of nuance" that
does not consider "Christ's teaching of healing, forgiveness and
reconciliation."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate statement, the nuns group criticized church leaders
for trying to blame the abuse crisis on gay priests.</TE>
<TE>   "The bishops need to accept responsibility for cover-ups and
inadequate pastoral care, instead of trying to shift the blame to gay
priests," the group said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A large majority of Protestant pastors surveyed predict that
non-Christian religions and New Age spirituality will become more
influential in the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-two percent of ministers expect a growing influence of
non-Christian faiths, compared to 5% who expect their influence will
decrease and 13% who don't anticipate much difference in the next 10
years.</LD>
<LD>   Ellison Research of Phoenix also found that 55% of ministers think
New Age spirituality will increase in influence in the next decade,
compared to 19% who think its influence will decrease and 26% who
don't expect much change in that time.</LD>
<TE>   Asked to predict other changes, ministers were most pessimistic
about the future of "overall religious freedom" in the United States.
Ten percent expected it to improve, while 46% said it would stay the
same and 44% expect declining religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Just over a quarter of ministers predict that Christianity will be
more influential in Americans' daily lives in 2012 than it is in
2002. Forty-one percent predict decreasing influence and 33% expect
it to remain about the same.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, based on a national sample of 567 ministers, have a
margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Harry Rositzke, 91; Ran CIA Spies Against USSR</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Rositzke, a farmer, author, teacher, scholar and spy who for 25
years ran Central Intelligence Agency covert operations against the
Soviet Union from Munich, New Delhi, New York and Washington, has
died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Rositzke died of pneumonia Monday in Warrenton, Va.</LD>
<LD>   An author of books on the CIA and the KGB, Rositzke also taught at
Harvard University and researched such arcana as Anglo-Saxon grammar
and vowel duration in High German. During the Cold War, he directed
the parachuting of espionage agents into the Ukraine region of the
Soviet Union.</LD>
<TE>   His books include "The CIA's Secret Operations" (1977) and "The
KGB: The Eyes of Russia" (1981), but he also wrote "The C-Text of the
Old English Chronicles," which is considered a classic of Anglo-Saxon
research. He did his doctoral dissertation at Harvard on "The Speech
of Kent Before the Norman Conquest."</TE>
<TE>   Rositzke was a veteran of World War II duty with the Office of
Strategic Services, the predecessor in espionage to the CIA. He
volunteered in 1946 to monitor the intelligence operations of the
Soviet Union, a major wartime ally against Nazi Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In the OSS, he served as chief of military intelligence in London
and Paris, and later worked in Germany, where he operated out of a
former sparkling-wine factory near Wiesbaden.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Schlesinger, who became an aide to President Kennedy and a
presidential scholar, was one of Rositzke's OSS colleagues. It was no
surprise to him that Rositzke opted for a career in intelligence
after the war.</TE>
<TE>   "War had made him a professional. Peace evidently offered him a
scope for analysis and action on questions more urgent than
Anglo-Saxon grammar, his previous specialty," Schlesinger wrote in a
preface to Rositzke's 1977 book on the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Doctorate</TE>
<TE>   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Rositzke graduated from Union College
and received a doctorate in Germanic philology at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935 and 1936, he studied experimental phonetics on a
fellowship at the University of Hamburg, where he had an opportunity
to witness the Nazis' consolidation of power in Germany. He would
later describe the experience as frightening.</TE>
<TE>   From 1936 to 1942, he taught at Harvard, the University of Omaha
and the University of Rochester.</TE>
<TE>   As a specialist on Soviet intelligence after the war, he moved
initially into quarters in Washington where, by his description: "The
walls were pockmarked with holes and the ceiling smudged with stains
from the rain and snow that leaked through the fragile roof."</TE>
<TE>   He ran agents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from 1949 to
1954, and was based in Munich for the last two years of this
assignment. "We were sending people into the Ukraine; people forget
that there was an active resistance movement there.... We'd fly them
in and parachute them from C-47s. We never lost a plane. We were
pleased to see how inefficient the antiaircraft forces were."</TE>
<TE>   The East German government in those years gave Rositzke one of the
longer entries in its published directory of CIA agents operating in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   When he was CIA station chief in New Delhi from 1957 to 1962,
Rositzke's espionage targets were Soviets, Chinese and Tibetans. He
lunched monthly with his resident counterpart from the GRU, the
Soviet military intelligence arm, and he developed a working
relationship with John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy's ambassador to
India, who was deeply suspicious of the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Recruitment Efforts</TE>
<TE>   Later in the 1960s, he worked on CIA recruitment of Soviet
diplomats in Washington and New York and began to focus on terrorism
and wars of national liberation. He retired from the CIA in 1970 as
chief of the international communism unit.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Rositzke purchased a 350-acre farm in Middleburg, Va.,
where in retirement he raised cattle and wrote about the craft of
intelligence. Espionage, he would argue, had a useful role in the
maintenance of political order.</TE>
<TE>   "Spies in the right places can induce a feeling of security by
negative reporting or guarantee no strategic surprises by positive
reporting. Their value in reducing the paranoid tendencies of the
Soviet Union should not be underestimated."</TE>
<TE>   Writing about the KGB, Rositzke observed: ''The clandestine
mentality is rooted in a conspiratorial view of the world ... [that]
someone out there is plotting against me."</TE>
<TE>   Rositzke wrote five books about Soviet affairs, the CIA and the
KGB, most of which were intended to supply information for the 1970s
public debate that accompanied disclosure of such covert CIA
operations as assassination plots and the drugging of people.</TE>
<TE>   By then, his thinking was at variance with the standard political
posture of the Cold Warriors of earlier times.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Barbara Bourgeoise Rositzke of
Middleburg; two children, John Brockman Rositzke of Jackson, Mich.,
and Anne Elizabeth Hunt of New York; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>The family of a man shot and killed by a Madera police officer while
sitting handcuffed in a police car has filed suit in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   Arturo Gonzalez, the family's attorney, said no specific monetary
claim was included in his clients' lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court. They want a jury to decide the value of Everardo
Torres' life.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Torres' family filed a $10-million claim against the
city of Madera, accusing Officer Marcy Noriega and other officers of
using excessive and unreasonable force when dealing with Torres while
breaking up a party on Oct. 27.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators say Noriega accidentally pulled out her handgun,
instead of her Taser, and shot Torres in the chest to stop him from
kicking out the police car's rear window.</TE>

<LD>Two psychologists have been appointed to examine a man accused of
stabbing a Greyhound bus driver and causing a crash that killed two
passengers, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A Fresno County judge has suspended criminal proceedings against
Arturo Tapia Martinez until his mental competency can be assessed,
the county public defender's office said.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez, 27, has pleaded innocent to two counts of murder and one
count of attempted murder. He has been held at the Fresno County Jail
since Sept. 30 in lieu of $3-million bail.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said Martinez stabbed the driver in the neck with a pair
of scissors, causing him to lose control of the bus headed from Los
Angeles to San Francisco. The bus flipped on its side, crushing two
women to death and injuring 51 other people.</TE>

<LD>A state appeals court upheld a civil jury's finding that Leonard Ross
started the Painted Cave fire, clearing the way for the county to
seek $2.75 million in damages from him.</LD>
<LD>   "Now we can move on to making him pay what he owes us, but it's
not a quick process," Deputy County Counsel Jake Stoddard said after
Thursday's ruling. "We have to identify his assets before we can
attempt to seize them."</LD>
<LD>   Ross, 49, a self-employed artist who lives on 40 acres near
Goleta, may have little in the way of financial holdings besides the
property he owns off Old San Marcos Road.</LD>
<TE>   The wind-driven wildfire in June 1990 destroyed hundreds of homes
and killed a woman. Although authorities were convinced it was set by
Ross to burn out a neighboring landowner, there wasn't enough
evidence to file criminal charges against him.</TE>

<HD>Ruled Tardy on Tax Appeal, O.C. May Cough Up Millions</HD>
<DH>State court sides with homeowner's demand for a lower
assessment, which could also mean refunds for 1,500 others treated
similarly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court has ruled in favor of an Orange County taxpayer
who was denied a property tax reduction in 1994, a decision that
could cost the county millions of dollars in refunds involving 1,500
property owners.</LD>
<LD>   The homeowners and businesses said the county owed them the tax
cuts because officials failed to consider their appeals within two
years. Under state law, appeals must be heard within two years. If
they are heard any later, the county must accept the taxpayer's
proposed value for the property.</LD>
<LD>   The appellate justices for the 4th District ruled Wednesday that
the county didn't follow the law. In the intervening years, the
judges said, the county also has failed to notify those taxpayers
that they could be due refunds for overpayment.</LD>
<TE>   The original case was filed by William Bunker, a San Juan
Capistrano homeowner. It later became a class-action case because
plaintiff attorneys produced evidence that Bunker was one of 1,500
property owners whose appeals were not heard within the two-year
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "The court of appeal is saying Orange County has no excuse for not
informing 1,500 taxpayers that it missed the two-year deadline and
should have adopted the lower [property] value," said Robert Julian
of San Francisco, one of the plaintiff attorneys. "These taxpayers
don't even know their rights were violated."</TE>
<TE>   County Counsel Benjamin de Mayo said he hadn't had a chance to
brief the Board of Supervisors on the ruling and couldn't say whether
it would be appealed to the state Supreme Court. He said he wouldn't
comment on the ruling before speaking to the board. He said he would
meet next week with Assessor Webster J. Guillory to discuss the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second court decision in a year faulting the county for
its property tax procedures. A Superior Court judge ruled in December
that the county's method for assessing property was unconstitutional
because some assessments exceed the 2% limit established by voters in
1978. That case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The Bunker case stems from efforts by taxpayers to have their
property values lowered during the early 1990s, when land values in
Orange County were dropping because of a sagging economy.</TE>
<TE>   The assessor's office had set the value of Bunker's home at
$940,221 for the 1992-93 tax year. On Sept. 6, 1992, Bunker filed an
appeal, saying the property had lost equity and should have been
valued at $770,000. Such a change would have reduced his property tax
bill.</TE>
<TE>   His appeal wasn't heard until November 1994 -- 26 months later. A
county appeals board rejected his claim and affirmed the assessor's
higher value.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, the county plunged into its historic bankruptcy,
and a federal judge froze all property tax appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Bunker filed suit in state court in 1998. The county denied it had
erred, and a judge threw Bunker's case out. The appeals court,
however, ruled that Bunker has a legitimate claim and sent the case
back to Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   County officials would not say how much money it could be forced
to refund. Estimates calculated in 1994 put the total at about $10
million. The plaintiff lawyers said the taxpayers are due $15 million
for each of the years covered in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Supervisors ... should do the right thing instead of
prolonging this litigation unnecessarily," Julian said.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 appeals weren't heard by the two-year deadline, the
lawsuit said. Of those, about half eventually were heard with the
appeals favoring taxpayers. An additional 500 were resolved without
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   That left 1,500 cases in which taxpayers did not get a property
tax reduction, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   The county has improved its procedure for dealing with tax appeals
and has a much more effective system for tracking when the two-year
deadline is approaching.</TE>

<LD>Parts of California seemed to be getting all the rain that nature
withheld the past year as a Pacific storm swept the state, drenching
the Bay Area, ending fire closures in two Southland national forests
and sending a car hydroplaning into people at an Orange County bus
stop.</LD>
<LD>   The storm, which brought the Los Angeles Basin its first
significant rainfall in almost 10 months, spanned much of the West
Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Waves, some approaching 30 feet, crashed along the shore, the
Sierra Nevada braced for up to 4 feet of snow, and power outages hit
San Francisco and 98,000 Southern California Edison customers.</LD>
<TE>   "The farther north you go, the heavier it is," said Stuart Seto of
the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   At its most potent in Central and Northern California, the
season's first storm poured up to 4 inches of rain on the San Luis
Obispo County coast and pounded the San Francisco Bay Area with 6
inches.</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Beach, a driver lost control on rain-slick Beach
Boulevard at 6:30 p.m. and crashed into a bus shelter.</TE>
<TE>   One man was trapped briefly under the debris of the collapsed
shelter and suffered a critical head injury. Three other people were
hospitalized with less serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The rainfall is expected to taper off today.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Suit on Ahmanson Study Is Put Off</HD>
<DH>City Council will wait until Ventura County board votes on
the development's environmental report before taking action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council put off mounting a legal challenge to
the environmental impact study for Ahmanson Ranch after some members
said it is unclear whether the document is flawed.</LD>
<LD>   West San Fernando Valley Councilman Dennis Zine, who had sought
the lawsuit, agreed to send the matter to five council committees for
review. He was responding to colleagues who said that the 3,050-home
development could help solve the housing crisis and that objections
to the environmental study need to be fleshed out.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't have the facts," said Councilman Nate Holden, warning
it could cost the city if it filed a "frivolous lawsuit."</LD>
<TE>   Zine and Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said they can support a
lawsuit claiming that the environmental study on the 2,080-acre
development does not adequately address such issues as traffic and
water quality. Zine requested the motion return to the council Dec.
11, the day after the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is expected
to approve the study.</TE>
<TE>   The land is in Ventura County, just west of the Los Angeles city
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic and water quality are among the issues behind opposition
to the project voiced at Friday's council meeting by representatives
of the city of Calabasas, Heal the Bay, the Woodland Hills Homeowners
Organization and the group Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The project has also drawn the opposition of celebrities,
including Rob Reiner, Martin Sheen and Erin Brockovich, as well as
former Vice President Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter took a jab at celebrity opponents and
said approving a lawsuit was premature. She asked for more proof that
problems outweigh the development's large addition to the housing
stock and its donation of 10,000 acres of open space for
preservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 10,000 acres of open space, which is roughly three times
the size of LAX, ought to be enough for everybody, including movie
stars," said Galanter, who represents the northeast Valley. "The
housing shortage is not going to get solved if we say no to every big
project."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Weston, an attorney for developer Washington Mutual, and
Victor Franco Jr. of the Central City Assn., also argued for delay in
any challenge to the environmental impact report, which has been
revised and updated since it was first issued in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The political process in Ventura County has yet to begin. There
have been no hearings before the Planning Commission," Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   "This motion is premature. I would urge you to recognize that
Washington Mutual supports this project because it is a good,
environmentally sensitive, smart-growth project."</TE>
<TE>   Zine said the property should be preserved as parkland and that
the development will worsen traffic congestion on the Ventura
Freeway. "This is simply a matter of corporate greed," he said.
"Washington Mutual has the land. They want to destroy the
environment. They want to tell the San Fernando Valley, 'You don't
count.' They want to have nothing but more money in their pockets."</TE>

<HD>Alert Issued for Sexual Predator in 31 Attacks</HD>
<DH>Long Beach police urge caution and ask the public to report
anything unusual no matter how minor it might seem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sexual predator who for six years has assaulted women in Seattle,
Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos and Long Beach is now linked to 31
attacks, police said Friday, urging the public to report neighborhood
disruptions as minute as a barking dog.</LD>
<LD>   "We know he's somehow identifying his victims ahead and planning
his ingress and egress to their house," said Linda Beardslee of the
Long Beach Police Department, who is leading a task force of agencies
investigating the assaults. "We believe he goes between yards, in
their backyard, alleys, across neighboring properties. He moves
around outside a lot."</LD>
<LD>   A $50,000 reward leading to the conviction of the serial attacker,
known as the Belmont Shore rapist until he committed assaults
elsewhere, was announced at a news conference at the Long Beach
Police Department. That city has had the greatest number of the known
attacks and contributed $25,000 to the reward. Los Angeles County and
Los Alamitos contributed $10,000 each, and Huntington Beach
contributed $5,000.</LD>
<TE>   The task force of police agencies, assisted by the FBI, is working
to find the intruder, whose methods and behavior, police said,
connect him to the 31 sexual assaults dating to 1996 in Seattle. At
least 13 have been linked by physical evidence, including DNA, and he
has also left fingerprints at crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   The predator has entered women's homes through unlocked windows or
doors, sometimes in the nude and always wearing a mask or face shield
before he confronts victims, or covers their faces.</TE>
<TE>   But Long Beach Police Chief Anthony W. Batts said Friday that the
man previously noted for being methodical has been making mistakes
that the public might notice. The man has unscrewed or broken porch
and motion detector lights at the homes of victims or their
neighbors. He has also been marked by some women during struggles,
including face scratches in August and a hand or finger injury during
a Thursday morning attack in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   And his absence or inactivity for periods of up to 18 months
between assaults -- June 2000 to December 2001 -- may help the public
connect someone they know to those times.</TE>
<TE>   "This person is out there and amongst us, but maybe he was in jail
for a while, maybe his job has taken him out of state," Beardslee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Information or tips may be left, anonymously if deemed necessary,
on a taped task force hotline: (866) 600-1110.</TE>
<TE>   Because his victims haven't been able to see him well, their
physical descriptions have varied wildly: He is 5-6 to 6 feet tall.
He is thin with a swimmer's build. He's pudgy. He has a buzz cut. He
has dreadlocks.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the man may have worn wigs or altered his appearance
in the attacks, which date to May 1996 in Seattle. The first attack
in Long Beach linked by DNA occurred Jan. 17, 1997, at 12 a.m., when
a 40-year-old woman was attacked in east Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The one clue the predator has left behind is DNA, which has
connected him to attacks but will mostly be useful after a suspect is
in custodyt.</TE>
<TE>   DNA can sometimes reveal age, race and other indicators, but
police on Friday would say only that their suspect is male and
possibly in his 20s to mid-30s.</TE>
<TE>   Details that may seem innocuous or insignificant out of context
might prove critical, Batts said. "There is no such thing as the
perfect crime," he added.</TE>
<TE>   And so police beseeched the public to look out, day or night, for
people who don't seem to belong to a neighborhood, or who are simply
unfamiliar, to watch for changes they are certain they did not make:
removed screens, windows nudged open, gates left ajar, extended dog
barking or tripped motion detector lights.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the public was asked to take care, keep all doors
and windows locked and to forget assumptions about who looks like a
dangerous person.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this person could ... be walking among us, someone we may
know," said Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill, "so it's important for
all of us to be very aware of what goes on around us."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Promotes 3 to Top Positions</HD>
<DH>LAPD chief says he chose people who are 'risk takers' and
creative. Police union praises the appointments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling his first major change of leadership at the Los Angeles
Police Department, Police Chief William J. Bratton said Friday he
will promote a veteran commander who worked with him in Boston, an
experienced Latino commander and a woman who headed the transit
police to be his top aides.</LD>
<LD>   Cmdr. James P. McDonnell, who has been with the LAPD for 21 years,
will become assistant chief, second in command to Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   Cmdr. George Gascon, who oversees the police academy, and Cmdr.
Sharon Papa, the former head of the region's transit police, will
become deputy chiefs. All three were candidates for the chief
position.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton said he chose the trio based upon their loyalty to the
department, ability to think "outside the box" and their leadership
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "I like people who are creative, who are risk takers, who are
assertive and who are not afraid to advance ideas -- and all these
three exhibit that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said McDonnell, 45, who coordinates the department's
community policing program, will serve as his No. 2. In an interview,
Bratton called McDonnell a friend of more than 20 years who shares
his vision for the department and who wrote a 100-page plan for
re-engineering the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Irish immigrants, McDonnell was born and raised in a
working-class Boston neighborhood. He first met Bratton when they
worked together in the city's Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Papa, 44, was chief of the county transit police from 1990 to 1997
-- until it was absorbed by the LAPD. She is known for tough talk and
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon, 48, who heads the LAPD's training group, won praise for
introducing ethics-based programs. He was endorsed by the Latino and
black officers' associations in his bid for chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very dependent on people I select to work with. As good as I
might be," Bratton said, "I am only as good as the people who work
with me, and, certainly, I have been blessed with making good
selections in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The appointments for many also signaled the end of the legacy of
former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. McDonnell, Papa and Gascon
represent the first generation of leadership to rise since Gates'
1992 retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "The previous administration's people were risk averse," Bratton
said. "I want people who are comfortable being in harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   Police union President Mitzi Grasso hailed Bratton's appointments
as a welcome and necessary break from the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so pleased," Grasso said. "Each one of them comes from a
different background and brings a different perspective from their
policing experience. All of them are representative of newer creative
thinking."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell once worked as an intern for Bratton, who was then a
lieutenant spearheading a new initiative known as the neighborhood
responsive policing program, a precursor to community policing
program he later established in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me an exposure to people's predicaments that most don't
see," McDonnell said of community policing. "It showed me there's an
opportunity if you take the time to work on community problems, that
you can make the neighborhood better and improve the lives of the
people living there."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said he came west because work opportunities were
better, and the LAPD was known for professionalism and merit-based
hiring.</TE>
<TE>   In the LAPD, McDonnell has worked as a patrol officer and homicide
detective, and he spent four years in the anti-gang unit and other
administrative posts.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon joined the LAPD in 1978. He commanded the Southeast Patrol
Division, Southeast Operation Support Division and Harbor Area Patrol
Division. In 2000, he was made responsible for education and training
for new recruits, sworn officers and civilians. In that role, he drew
widespread praise for introducing ethical considerations into police
training.</TE>
<TE>   A native of upstate New York, Papa began her career with Santa
Monica Police Department and joined the transit police in 1981.
Within two years, Papa was promoted to president of the transit
police union and by 1990 was named the department's chief.</TE>
<TE>   Under her management, the department quadrupled in size in five
years. She built up a specialized anti-graffiti unit and won the
first federal community policing grant for transit police, employing
tactics Bratton used to build New York City's transit police force.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the transit force merged with the LAPD, and three years
later Papa was named the LAPD's top spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "She is very courageous, very good with people and a wonderful
selection," said Grasso. "She's a great pick, has wonderful people
skills, is very approachable, a great problem-solver and not afraid
to take on a problem."</TE>
<TE>   All three applied for the chief's position this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Among command rank officers who recently retired or have said they
will soon leave the LAPD are Asst. Chiefs David Gascon and J.I.
Davis, and Deputy Chief Willie Pannell.</TE>

<LD>A speeding driver was arrested early Friday on suspicion of
carjacking and kidnapping after Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies
found a bound and beaten man in the trunk of the car.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Jovon Lamont Williams, 20, and his passenger
appeared nervous when deputies stopped them for speeding on Lancaster
Boulevard just before 1:30 a.m., so the deputies separated them. The
passenger told deputies that Williams and another man who was no
longer in the car had pistol-whipped his friend John Anzalone and put
him in the trunk.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' alleged accomplice, William Alridge, 19, was arrested at
a nearby home.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Palmdale woman pleaded no contest Friday to conspiracy and other
felony charges for her role in a pyramid scheme that bilked hundreds
of working-class Latinos out of more than $2.5 million, prosecutors
said.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandra Nunez, 40, was sentenced to 40 months in state prison
for her participation in La Luz de Oro, a Panorama City
telecommunications company.</LD>
<LD>   Members paid $75 to join the company and were required to attend
meetings and purchase long-distance telephone cards. They were told
they could share in the profits of the phone services and qualify for
free homes and cars if they persuaded others to join, police said.</LD>
<TE>   A jury convicted the ringleaders of the scheme, Mercedes
Navarette, her husband, Felix, and Mercedes' daughter, Joan
Frederick, on similar charges last month.</TE>

<HD>Airport Drops Plan for Terminal</HD>
<DH>Citing community resistance, the Burbank facility's
authority votes 5-4 to end a more than 20-year effort to replace
existing building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by a lack of community and political support, a split
Burbank Airport authority voted Friday to abandon a two-decade effort
to replace its aging terminal with a new facility on another site
nearby.</LD>
<LD>   After casting a 5-4 vote, commissioners emerged from a closed-door
meeting to say they are dropping their plans to move the terminal
because of strained relations with Burbank city officials and
residents who vehemently oppose airport growth.</LD>
<LD>   "There's just incredible resistance to see a terminal built," said
Chris Holden, president of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport
Authority, who was among those who voted to abandon the effort.</LD>
<TE>   The only way the authority would resurrect its plan is if "the FAA
mandates that we move the terminal" for safety reasons, said
Commissioner Carl Meseck, who also voted to kill the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Authority Vice President Charles Lombardo, who wanted the facility
moved, said the panel's action would have "a very bad impact on
Burbank residents."</TE>
<TE>   The decision drew outrage from some Burbank officials, who for the
past several years have made nighttime flight curfews and growth
restrictions into bargaining chips for allowing the airport to expand
or move its terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big step, to say they're giving up on a new terminal,"
said City Manager Robert R. "Bud" Ovrom. "This is telling Burbank
they're not going to do curfews."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Kirsch, the city's attorney who handles airport issues,
agreed. "For the authority to essentially throw in the towel is
pretty irresponsible," he said. Even without a new terminal, he
added, "Burbank will use whatever power it has to make sure this
airport is carefully planned with community consultation."</TE>
<TE>   But some residents placed blame with the city, which recently
approved a plan to expand the 14-gate, 173,000-square-foot main
airport terminal building by 40,000 square feet so that the
facilities could accommodate beefed-up security measures required by
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "The city gave it all away when it allowed [the airport] to
expand," said resident Stan Hymon, an advocate against airport
growth. He called the airport's security concerns "a pretext" for
enlarging its facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank Airport officials have been working toward moving the
terminal since at least 1980, when the Federal Aviation
Administration said the 70-year-old facility was too close to one of
the runways.</TE>
<TE>   Current airport building standards require that a terminal be
located at least 750 feet from the runway's center line. Portions of
Burbank's terminal are only 300 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to move the terminal to a parcel of land owned by
Lockheed Martin fell apart in 1985 when the Department of Defense
objected to public use of the property because it was too close to
top-secret manufacturing facilities for the military, said airport
spokesman Victor Gill.</TE>
<TE>   The airport again tried to move its terminal in the late 1980s
onto a different parcel of land, but problems with the environmental
review process scuttled that attempt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the airport authority spent $86 million to purchase a
130-acre parcel from Lockheed. That same year, the agency reached a
tentative agreement with the city to build a replacement terminal on
the site, expandable to 19 gates.</TE>
<TE>   In return, airport officials agreed to numerous concessions,
including closure of Burbank's passenger terminal between 11 p.m. and
6 a.m. to reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   But that plan ran into opposition from the FAA, which called the
planned closure a de facto curfew, which is restricted under federal
law.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement expired in May 2000, when the airport
could not obtain FAA approval for flight curfews. Last year, Burbank
voters complicated negotiations by approving Measure A, which
prohibited the City Council from approving new construction at or
renovation of the airport unless a mandatory curfew was imposed.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Superior Court Judge Richard Montes declared Measure A
unconstitutional, saying the initiative violated state laws governing
airports, elections and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   But Measure A still "reflects community sentiment" about what the
airport should be allowed to do, the authority's policy statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B, another voter initiative passed in November 2000,
requires that "if there is a deal for a new terminal, it would have
to go before voters of Burbank," Holden said. "The voters of Burbank
can still veto the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the parcel purchased for the new terminal will probably
be leased or sold, officials said. A developer is negotiating with
the airport to buy that land for building a Wal-Mart and a Sam's
Club, Ovrom said.</TE>

<HD>Company Hopes L.A. Motorists Take Car-Sharing for a Test
Drive</HD>
<DH>Supporters liken the programs to time shares for vehicles.
They offer people access without the expense of ownership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trend-setting Los Angeles is behind the curve when it comes to one
novel traffic-reducing solution: car-sharing.</LD>
<LD>   But that is about to change.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle-based Flexcar is betting there is a sizable market of
Angelenos who want occasional access to a car without the costs or
hassles of ownership. This month, the company is rolling out  its
members-only service at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, the
Burbank Metrolink station and parking lots in Santa Monica and near
Old Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Car-sharing organizations differ from conventional car rental
agencies in that members typically pay only for the hours and miles
they drive.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent users often buy bulk-rate plans to lower their hourly
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like time-share automobiles," said Neil Peterson, president
and chief executive officer of Flexcar and former executive director
of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   To hear its boosters describe it, car-sharing can help alleviate
freeway congestion by making public transportation more attractive
while saving people money. If the train or subway doesn't quite get
you there, so the thinking goes, you can hop into a car-share vehicle
and drive the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. has the potential to be the largest market for
[car-sharing]," said Michael Woo, a former city councilman and now
general manager of Flexcar's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   But others question whether car-obsessed Southern Californians
will ever embrace a car-sharing lifestyle. It may attract low-income
people without cars, but for others its appeal will depend on how
much it can improve their quality of life, said Alan Pisarski, author
of "Commuting in America."</TE>
<TE>   In places where owning a vehicle is not economical, such as
parking-space-crunched Manhattan or San Francisco, car-sharing makes
sense. But in Southern California, Pisarski said, "it's going to be
tough-sweating and a tough sell."</TE>
<TE>   First popularized in Europe in the late 1980s, the concept of
car-sharing arrived in North America in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 18 car-sharing organizations in the United States
serving more than 12,000 members, according to Susan Shaheen, a
research scientist at UC Berkeley's Partners for Advanced Transit and
Highways program.</TE>
<TE>   The networks include large for-profit enterprises such as Flexcar,
with 7,500 total members in Seattle, Portland, San Diego and
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also smaller operators such as tiny Dancing Rabbit
Vehicle Cooperative, which serves 15 members at an eco-village in
Rutledge, Mo., and City CarShare in the San Francisco Bay Area, a
nonprofit group that started last year and now has 2,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities with car-sharing programs include Boston, Chicago,
New York, Toronto, Montreal and Boulder, Colo., according to the Web
site, www.carsharing.net.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for creative solutions for transportation,"
said Elizabeth Sullivan, executive director of City CarShare.
"Car-sharing is so much more convenient than taking your car
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Etheridge, a 37-year-old San Francisco resident, is a recent
convert. He doesn't own a car because it's so expensive, and parking
anywhere near his Mission District home is a nightmare, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For years he relied only on public transit, but he now car-shares
a few times a month. When he needs wheels, he saunters to a City
CarShare site two blocks from his home and jumps into one of the five
Volkswagen Beetles and Jettas stationed there. "It's almost as if I
have a car," Etheridge said.</TE>
<TE>   For occasional drivers, car-sharing can be an even better deal
than ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of owning a 5-year-old car in Southern California, after
factoring in depreciation, insurance, gas, maintenance and repairs,
is more than $400 a month, according to the Automobile Club of
Southern California. New cars cost more than $600 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Car-sharing organizations say their average member spends less
than $100 a month. Car-sharing enthusiasts include environmentalists
as well as families that own a car but need an occasional second
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Many networks, including Flexcar and City CarShare, have electric
and alternative-fuel vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Quint, a 51-year-old bicycle education consultant in
Long Beach, and his wife get along fine with one car most of the
time. But Quint recently had to take his father to a doctor's
appointment when his wife also needed a car.</TE>
<TE>   So he went to the Long Beach bike station, where the nonprofit
Bikestation Coalition has been running a pilot car-sharing program in
partnership with Flexcar.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Quint was cruising toward his dad in North Long Beach in a
Ford Think City electric car.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, they're kind of a backup," said Quint, one of 80 members
in the program. Car-sharing is also increasingly adopted by small-
and medium-size companies that can't or don't want to maintain their
own corporate vehicles, Flexcar executives say.</TE>
<TE>   The company's launch in Los Angeles, Burbank, Pasadena and Santa
Monica is small for now, with just seven Honda Civics spread over the
four sites. In the next few months, three cars will be stationed at
Cal State L.A. and six more vehicles at yet-to-be-determined sites
around the county, Woo said. Possible future Flexcar sites include
the North Hollywood Red Line station, Warner Center in Woodland Hills
and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not car-sharing remains a niche or becomes mainstream,
experts say, programs should be lauded for providing a transportation
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows people more mobility," said Dan Beal, transportation
policy manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California. "If
something like shared cars can help relieve congestion, it's good for
everybody."</TE>

<HD>Homeless Find Refuge in Storm</HD>
<DH>About half a dozen people spend a rainy night at the Simi
Valley shelter. Other centers in the county are set to open Dec. 1.</DH>

<LD>Earlier this week, 36-year-old Brenda was sleeping on the ground in
Thousand Oaks. But Thursday night, as rain pounded away, Brenda spent
a warm, dry night at a homeless shelter in Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The city's shelter network, known as PADS -- Public Action to
Deliver Shelter -- opened for the season Nov. 1, and operators are
gearing up to help more people as rains and cold weather continue.</LD>
<LD>   A similar system of using local churches for emergency winter
shelters will begin Dec. 1 in the Thousand Oaks area and in the Ojai
Valley.</LD>
<TE>   In the western end of the county, Ventura and Oxnard have taken
turns opening a National Guard armory as a winter shelter for several
years. This year, it will open Dec. 1 in Ventura. Most shelters
operate through late March.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people are homeless in the county,
said Cathy Brudnicki, chairwoman of the Ventura County Homeless and
Housing Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda, who declined to give her last name, didn't know the Simi
Valley shelter at a Knights of Columbus hall was open earlier this
week, when she found herself exhausted and unable to afford a motel.</TE>
<TE>   "I slept on the dirt. It was the first time in my whole life I
ever did that," she said. "It was definitely humiliating. But I
hadn't slept for a day and a half and was so fatigued I had to sleep
somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   When she found the Simi Valley shelter, "it was a total relief,
because I knew I could sleep here and I knew it was safe," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-year-old Leia was also at the Simi Valley shelter as the
season's first storm arrived, landing there after a fight with her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lifesaver," said Leia, who also requested anonymity.
"Otherwise I'd be out in the cold feeling down and depressed. I'm
glad to have a place to go to every night."</TE>
<TE>   About half a dozen homeless people showed up Thursday night,
despite the rain, said John Purvis, who coordinates the PADS program
for the Samaritan Center, a morning drop-in center where homeless
people can get a meal, shower and receive mail.</TE>
<TE>   Purvis guessed that a lack of transportation was responsible for
the low numbers Thursday, but that more people will soon find the
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, an average of 20 to 22 people showed up a night, and
about 2,500 overnight stays were logged over five months.</TE>
<TE>   Though the program has been around for years, Purvis said he still
struggles to find churches willing to lend a room one night a week
large enough for two dozen people sleeping on mats and cots. The
shelter now rotates at four churches and a Knights of Columbus hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The churches are far more protective of their buildings and
campuses than you'd imagine," said Purvis, who arrives at each site
for the 8 p.m. nightly check-in. Many of those needing overnight
shelter are dealing with substance abuse problems, have mental
disorders or have issues with authority figures, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Help of Ojai, a social services agency that runs a seniors center,
coordinates that city's shelter program. Spokeswoman Jessica Murray
said the agency accommodated at least 136 homeless people last year.</TE>
<TE>   With a limping economy and welfare benefits soon to expire for
those who have been jobless more than five years, Murray thinks use
of the shelter may increase this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Working at a minimum-wage job in this county is not going to pay
the rent," she said. "Even working two minimum-wage jobs might not be
enough to afford what's available."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, the budget for running the armory, at 1270 Arundell
Ave., is nearly $314,000, said the city's Nicole Doner. Of that
amount, Ventura put in nearly $58,000, Oxnard $43,000 and the county
$16,000. Camarillo donated $10,000 and Port Hueneme is expected to
pay $2,500. Most of the balance is from state and federal funds for
emergency shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Oxnard Rescue Mission, which only serves men,
provides 60 beds year-round.</TE>
<TE>   The county Homeless and Housing Coalition sponsors an annual
survey that monitors those using local shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, a survey found that 55% of shelter residents were
women and children, 62% were using a shelter for the first time,
about 53% had been homeless for six months or less and one in 10 were
55 years old or older.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-two percent were white and nearly a third were Latino. More
than a third had been in Ventura County at least 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "People think of the homeless person as the guy on the side of a
freeway with a sign, but that's not the real face of homelessness in
Ventura County," the coalition's Brudnicki said. "It's someone who's
been here for a while who finds themselves in an unfortunate
circumstance."</TE>
<TE>   What causes a person to become homeless initially varies,
according to the survey. Losing a job was cited by 31%, followed by
18% who were evicted, 18% with a mental illness, 18% facing a drug or
alcohol problem and 11% who cited a divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Karol Schulkin, homeless coordinator for the county's Human
Services Agency, said the working poor have been hit hard and that
even a temporary setback could push them into homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of food pantries -- requests have been greater this year
-- makes us think the shelters will get more people. But we won't
know until the doors actually open," she said.</TE>

<HD>5 Hurt When Car Hits Huntington Beach Bus Shelter</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four people at a bus stop were injured -- one critically -- Friday
when a driver lost control on a rain-slick Huntington Beach street
and spun his car into the shelter where they were waiting.</LD>
<LD>   "It just kept going round and round and round," said Madeline
Reid, 63, a passenger in the 1993 Lincoln driven by Lee Vogt, 59, of
Anaheim. "I just held on for dear life. I had my eyes closed, held on
to my seat belt and thought I was going to die."</LD>
<LD>   The two were going to a square dance about 6:30 p.m., Reid said,
when Vogt tried to change lanes on southbound Beach Boulevard near
Warner Avenue and the car spun out of control.</LD>
<TE>   Vogt, who was also slightly injured but declined treatment, blamed
the accident on the slippery road.Three of the four injured people
were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, said Sgt. Mike Reynolds
of the Huntington Beach Police Department. The most seriously hurt,
he said, was a man briefly trapped under the collapsed bus shelter
who suffered a head injury that could be serious. The fourth injured
pedestrian was taken to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center with
unknown injuries, he said</TE>
<TE>   The accident is under investigation.</TE>

<HD>How Vigilance Won Out at Crystal Cove</HD>
<DH>Aggressive efforts by environmentalists persuaded the state
to drop a resort plan in favor of a learning center, public access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crucial point in the battle over Crystal Cove occurred nearly two
years ago behind a building at a Corona del Mar elementary school.</LD>
<LD>   Developer Michael Freed, who wanted to transform the rustic
beachside shacks into a $30-million resort, came face to face with
vocal environmentalist Joan Irvine Smith, a member of the powerful
Irvine family.</LD>
<LD>   Freed, who had developed a similar coastal resort at Big Sur a few
years earlier, was about to lay out his development plan for Crystal
Cove, which featured exclusive $400-a-night cottages. Smith was
determined to stop him.</LD>
<TE>   Freed asked Smith if they could meet to discuss the development.
Smith agreed, but when she arrived at the school for the February
2001 public meeting, a friend suggested that she not be seen with
Freed. So the two talked behind the building 30 minutes before Freed
and the state Parks Department presented his plan.</TE>
<TE>   When Freed began to describe his proposal to Smith, she cut him
off.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Freed, I don't like your plan," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents booed and heckled as the development was outlined that
night. It was the starting point of lobbying, fund-raising and
behind-the-scenes negotiating to derail the project.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Smith and other environmentalists won out -- but only
after months of protests and negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the state proposed a far more modest plan -- an
education and cultural center offering overnight stays at the
refurbished cottages for no more than $100 -- at the enclave south of
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and others attribute the turnabout to aggressive efforts by
environmentalists and local residents who fought to keep Crystal Cove
accessible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of the Irvine Coast, the Sierra Club, the Alliance to
Rescue Crystal Cove and other groups had been working to open the
cottages to the public since the state took possession of the
property from the Irvine Co. in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   They championed preservation of the 1920s-era cottages, one of the
last examples of a Southern California beach colony. For decades, the
cottages were used by longtime tenants of the Irvine family. When the
state took over the land, it planned to evict the tenants
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   But the tenants clung tenaciously for two decades to their
cottages, stalling their removal until June 2001. "I knew our time
was up," said Laura Davick, whose parents met at the cove in 1940 and
bought their cottage for $2,000 in 1960. "I wanted to be involved in
the big picture, the long-term preservation [of the cottages]."</TE>
<TE>   But that plan called for a lot of money -- about $30 million --
that the state could not afford.</TE>
<TE>   Freed's development plan seemed a win-win for the state: The
cottages would be restored, major improvements to the infrastructure
would be made and the state would not have to pay for it. As a bonus,
the state would collect sales tax revenue from a resort.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Smith declared her opposition to the planned resort in
January 2001, she called a meeting at her farm in San Juan Capistrano
with the groups involved in the preservation of Crystal Cove. Over
two days, she brought together representatives of the Nature
Conservancy, Orange County Coastkeeper, Sierra Club, Defend the Bay,
Natural Resources Defense Council, Laguna Canyon Conservancy, Friends
of the Irvine Coast and others.</TE>
<TE>   "You may not all agree on the outcome," she told them, "but let's
find a common line, and that's: Stop the development."</TE>
<TE>   At urging of allies, Smith attended a fund-raiser for Gov. Gray
Davis and talked to him and his wife, Sharon, about Crystal Cove. The
first lady has a special interest in restoration of historic
buildings and seemed intrigued by Crystal Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Morabito, then the new director of the state Coastal
Conservancy, said he spoke with the governor, who urged the group to
find a way to keep the land open to the public without a resort.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, the state was negotiating with Freed, who ultimately
agreed to a $2-million buyout. The Coastal Conservancy, which works
to enhance public access to the coast, agreed to pay the sum.</TE>
<TE>   Freed could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Now all the state needed was $13 million to fund the restoration
of the cottages and other repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Davick and Smith sponsored a Feb. 26 fund-raiser for Proposition
40, a $2.6-billion bond measure to fund parks and recreation projects
that was about to go before voters in March. They raised $25,000 for
the measure, which passed. Davis earmarked $9.2 million of that for
Crystal Cove.</TE>
<TE>   The state is now about to take bids for the restoration and
improvements. Officials hope to have the first cottages ready for the
public in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith is cautious: "I've had years of experience. At first
blush it looks like everything is in place and everything will go
forward, and the next thing you know everything falls apart. You have
to have constant vigilance."</TE>

<HD>Obstacles Seen to Any Davis Run for Higher Office</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his reelection Tuesday, Gov. Gray Davis added a fifth statewide
victory to his resume, setting the record for the most won by a
California Democrat and demonstrating the success of his disciplined
and pugilistic campaign style.</LD>
<LD>   Running for president or vice president would be a natural next
step for a lame-duck California governor who recaptured his seat in a
year in which many of his peers were forced out of office. Yet Davis'
slight margin over neophyte challenger Bill Simon Jr. and the
widespread disaffection of voters have hobbled his ability to win
higher office, many political experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "I would say beating Bill Simon by five points is not exactly a
good launching pad for a good presidential run," said Stuart
Rothenberg, a Washington, D.C.-based political analyst. "He beat a
candidate who was damaged goods. He gets no points for his victory."</LD>
<TE>   If Davis has any hope of springing from the governor's office to
another elected position, political consultants and legislative
leaders agree, he must use his last term to build a record of
achievements and rehabilitate his image among California voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way for him to consider a run for another office is to
prove once and for all to the voters that he can be a good governor,"
said Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman, who ran the campaign of
newly elected Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell. "This time,
it's not just about counting votes.... You really have to balance the
budget, find affordable health care, work on the public education
system. Those are things people are looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' dismal ratings -- a Times exit poll Tuesday found that 61%
of voters disapproved of the job he has done as governor -- could
actually motivate him to approach his last term in a different way,
some suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not in great political shape to begin with, so the
closeness of the margin is in some ways an opportunity, because it
could move him to mend some fences," said Darry Sragow, a political
strategist for the Democrats in the state Assembly. "If he gets the
message, it's the old slap across the face that you see in those old
movies. And then the character in the movie says, 'I needed that.' "</TE>
<TE>   The governor's defenders note that as head of the state with the
largest number of electoral votes, he would have a built-in advantage
running for president. In addition, Davis was at the top of a
Democratic ticket that dominated state elections in a year in which a
Republican tide swept much of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "California was a beacon in terms of holding the line for the
Democratic Party," said state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres.
"If anything, Gray Davis' stock has risen nationally."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has not said whether he will pursue higher office,
although he has assured voters -- but not quite promised them -- that
he will serve out his second term. "I don't plan to run for another
office in the next four years," he told reporters during a Long Beach
campaign stop Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Advisors say Davis -- who is superstitious about getting ahead of
himself -- avoided speculating about future runs while working his
way up the state's political ladder from assemblyman to controller to
lieutenant governor and then governor.</TE>
<TE>   "In my entire 9 1/2-year relationship with him, we never had a
conversation about him running for some office other than governor,"
said Davis political strategist Garry South. "I would take him at his
word when he says he wants to serve out his second term as governor.
Beyond that, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Friends note that when Davis leaves office he will be 64 -- giving
him plenty of time to launch a second career in the private sector if
he chooses to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "He has never in his life had the opportunity to earn money, buy a
big home or have the kinds of comforts that come to people who are
successful," said media executive Tom Quinn, who served with Davis in
Gov. Jerry Brown's administration. "I don't know that he wants to be
90 and poor."</TE>
<TE>   But some political experts find it hard to believe that
Davis, known for his relentless political drive, won't at least
consider a run for president.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not capable of resisting," said Republican consultant Dan
Schnur.</TE>
<TE>   "This man is a political android, and he was hard-wired a long
time ago," Schnur said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters and critics alike say that if Davis is planning a
presidential bid, he should spend the next four years repairing the
relationships damaged in his first term.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn., who had
a falling out with Davis over policy and the governor's fund-raising,
said he and other education leaders will be looking to Davis for
stronger support on public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis has been very lukewarm on the basic issues that his core
constituencies find very important," Johnson said. "If he wants to be
the vice presidential candidate or even presidential candidate, he's
got to reconnect with his base."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) urged Davis to return
to Sacramento and immediately work to create a dialogue with members
of the Legislature who have felt alienated from his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "You bring folks around a table and you hash those things out,"
Wesson said. "I think it's imperative."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest challenges facing the governor, many political
experts said, will be changing the perception that his fund-raising
dictates his policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seen as selling off the Capitol piece by piece for campaign
donations," said George Gorton, longtime political consultant for
former Gov. Pete Wilson. "He can't undo that, so he has to replace
that in voters' mind with something else."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts suggest that Davis try to position himself as an
alternative to the Bush administration by taking opposing stances on
issues such as the environment, education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a twofer -- not only do you get a lot of chits and
credentials with the Democratic base, but you also create a national
profile for yourself on policy issues," said Chris Lehane, who was a
Davis consultant after serving as Vice President Al Gore's press
secretary in the 2000 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that strategy will be harder to pursue in a year in
which California is facing a budget deficit of at least $10 billion,
which will require cutting programs, not adding them.</TE>
<TE>   The governor acknowledged as much during a post-election news
conference when he laid out, for the first time, an agenda for his
second term.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he wants to improve high schools and provide health
insurance for every child in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "That may be too ambitious," he added quickly. "We may not be able
to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the governor is able to transform his image in the next
four years, other obstacles may discourage him from jumping onto the
national stage.</TE>
<TE>   The actual process of running for president is one that Davis, who
is notoriously stiff and private, would not naturally excel at,
political experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike California campaigns, which are waged predominantly through
television advertising, key presidential primaries in Iowa and New
Hampshire require a sustained effort at wooing individual voters at
kaffeeklatsches and local "meet and greets."</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge for Gray is that if he has to compete in a retail
arena, that's not his strength," said Democratic strategist Roy Behr,
who works with state and federal candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that Davis' best chance could come as a vice
presidential candidate. "He understands message, he has a willingness
to be an attack dog and he's disciplined," said Democratic consultant
Kam Kuwata, who once was a political strategist for Davis and now
works with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever he does, some political experts warn that he should not
see Tuesday's victory as a mandate for future runs.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing for Gray Davis is this: He can never
confuse beating Bill Simon with being popular," Schnur said.</TE>

<LD>A commercial fisherman has pleaded guilty to violating federal
fishing quotas, the Ventura County district attorney's office said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Morici, 38, of Oxnard was fined $16,000 and placed on three
years' probation for exceeding the quota of shortspine and longspine
thornyhead rockfish by more than three tons, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an extremely high fine for an individual," Deputy Dist.
Atty. Karen Wold said. "You usually see this kind of fine when you're
dealing with a corporation."</LD>
<TE>   In a complaint filed by the district attorney's office,
authorities alleged Morici was trying to get around the limit by
falsely identifying a catch in 2001 as broadbanded thornyhead
rockfish, a variety found only off the Alaskan shore.</TE>
<TE>   Morici pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of filing false or
inaccurate landing receipts, Wold said.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Invites Business Leaders on Tour of Asia</HD>
<DH>Records show many were donors to Hahn's campaign against
secession. The trip is intended to promote trade and tourism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster and Jeffrey L. Rabin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn announced Friday that he will take a delegation
of about 15 business officials to Asia next week, many of whom
contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his anti-secession
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he invited leaders of businesses that would benefit from
increased Asian trade and tourism. Their role in helping him defeat
secession measures earlier this week was not a factor, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "Politics doesn't have anything to do with this," Hahn said at a
news conference at the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping center. "It's
about economics."</LD>
<TE>   The business executives will be paying their own way on the 10-day
trip, which is being billed as a trade and tourism mission. At one
stop in Tokyo, Hahn will be accompanied by actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Dodgers pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii to encourage travel
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn will meet with tourism operators and officials in Seoul,
Beijing, Tokyo, Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong, as well as airport
and shipping line executives. He hopes to boost tourism, which has
sharply declined, particularly among Asians. He also wants to return
with agreements from airlines to use Ontario International Airport
for passengers and cargo, and encourage Asian officials to hire Los
Angeles firms for work in those countries. Critics of the mayor view
the trip as a reward for those who helped him in his bid to prevent
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood from creating separate cities.
Hahn's L.A. United campaign, which raised more than $6 million, was
successful; citywide, voters rejected secession in the Valley 67% to
33%. And 71% of voters rejected a separate Hollywood city in
Tuesday's election.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, the former state assemblyman who helped lead the
Valley secession effort, said the delegation includes the downtown
business elite that helped the mayor beat back secession.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same in-crowd," Katz said. "It's a harmonic convergence
of good politics and good prospecting."</TE>
<TE>   The firms represented on the trip contributed at least $333,000 to
the mayor's anti-secession campaign. They include several of the
city's largest contractors, including architectural and engineering
firms that have plans to expand Los Angeles International Airport and
that are hoping for more work at Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Landy, president of DMJM, a contractor on LAX projects that
gave $40,000 to L.A. United, will be traveling with the mayor. Edward
McSpedon, executive vice president of engineering firm HNTB, is also
joining the mayor; he donated $1,000, and his firm gave $100,000.
HNTB has been awarded a contract to help with the city's master plan
for expanding the Ontario airport.</TE>
<TE>   Also traveling with the mayor is Shawn Anderson, chairman of WH
Smith, which owns concessions at LAX. The company gave $50,000 to the
mayor's anti-secession campaign after the Airport Commission awarded
the Atlanta-based firm a three-year extension of its contract.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman Hillard, which was one of the earliest donors to L.A.
United and contributed $35,000, will have two representatives on the
trip. The Department of Water and Power is paying their way as part
of the firm's contract to coordinate public relations.</TE>
<TE>   The business delegation also includes: Andrew Cherng, chief
executive of the Panda Restaurant Group, whose business gave $50,000;
Peter Woo, who heads Megatoys, which contributed $10,000 to L.A.
United; and Shu Kwan Woo, the CEO of ABC Toys, where associates gave
a total of $20,000 to the mayor's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Other executives invited on the tour are: Lynne Haraway, vice
president of the Bechtel Infrastructure Corp., which gave $5,000;
C.S. Ha, director of the Korean Centennial, publisher of the Korea
Times newspaper, whose chairman gave $100; and Earl Gales, chairman
and chief executive of Jenkins/Gales &amp; Martinez Inc., which gave
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Frances Kao, an attorney with the law firm of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, is also part of the delegation. Her firm held
a fund-raiser for the mayor's campaign in September, pulling in
nearly $18,000 from partners and others.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of executives were not solely on the mayor's side in the
secession fight. Jim Dunn, president and chief executive of the
Airtel Plaza Hotel across the street from Van Nuys Airport, provided
rooms for secession events, including a major kickoff last August.
The mayor used rooms there for a significant address the morning
after the election. Alan Skobin, a vice president and general counsel
of Galpin Ford, is also traveling with the mayor; his boss, Bert
Boeckmann, is a police commissioner who supported secession but who
did not contribute as much as expected to that effort.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of two business organizations also are going on the trip
-- Bruce Ackerman, president and chief executive of the Economic
Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, and Lee Harrington, president
and chief executive of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
Neither the executives nor the organizations were listed as donors to
L.A. United.</TE>

<HD>Judge Blocks Environmental Suit Against Halaco</HD>
<DH>Attorneys hoped to move the case forward. It has been
delayed while the Oxnard metal recycler seeks Chapter 11 protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has blocked efforts by environmental
groups to push forward with a lawsuit that accuses an Oxnard metal
recycler of fouling the air and water near Ormond Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed last year in federal court, was automatically
put on hold when Halaco Engineering filed for Chapter 11 protection
in July.</LD>
<LD>   The company's attorneys said without such protection, Halaco would
have trouble complying with demands by the Regional Water Quality
Control Board to clean up the property, perched on the edge of
sensitive wetlands.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Environmental Defense Center and the citizens
group Channelkeeper urged a judge to allow their litigation to move
forward, arguing that environmental concerns raised in their court
papers needed to be quickly addressed.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Robin Riblet disagreed. She ruled Nov. 1 that Halaco
should be allowed to continue working toward meeting the water
board's demands without having to contend with a legal challenge that
would divert its attention and resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a company, a small company with 40-odd employees, that
has been up to its eyeballs in negotiations and hearings with the
regional board," Riblet said during a two-hour hearing in Santa
Barbara. "There is only so far [Halaco] can be stretched."</TE>
<TE>   Riblet ordered the parties to return in April to see how well
Halaco has done in complying with a sweeping order to stop the soupy
discharges from the plant that since 1970 have yielded 40-foot-high
slag heaps near Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The discharges, which amount to half a million gallons of
contaminated water each month, are to end by December, and the slag
heaps must be removed within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials estimate they will spend more than $1 million to
meet a long list of technical requirements. They say that fighting
the environmental lawsuit had strapped the company's resources to the
point that bankruptcy was the only option.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco attorneys told Riblet that the company already has made
substantial progress toward complying with the water board's order
but said there is still plenty of work to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here not to get out of the [water board's order]," said
Halaco's attorney, David Shemano of Los Angeles. "We are here to
comply with that order."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental lawsuit alleges two decades of violations of
clean air and water laws at the plant, which has long been under fire
by regulators, area residents and environmental activists.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco set up shop in 1970 at Oxnard's southern tip, an area
flanked by wetlands that are home to such protected species as the
tidewater goby and the California least tern.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, millions of pounds of aluminum and magnesium scrap are
melted at the plant. The recycled product is sold to soda bottlers
and car companies. What is left has been pumped into waste ponds,
where it builds up in slag heaps.</TE>
<TE>   The water board's order addresses the slag heap and related
concerns. The environmental groups say their lawsuit focuses on other
areas -- air pollution and storm water runoff -- not addressed by the
regional board.</TE>

<HD>Parolee Held in Slayings at Shop</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys man is accused of shooting two auto store workers
in a dispute over brake pads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A parolee accused of shooting two Van Nuys auto-parts store employees
to death in a dispute over a $20 pair of brake pads was arrested by a
multi-agency task force at a Canyon Country apartment, authorities
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Jackson, 40, of Van Nuys was taken into custody without
incident at 10:45 p.m. Thursday in the 27500 block of Sierra Highway
by a team that included the Los Angeles Police Department, the U.S.
Marshals Service's Fugitive Task Force and the state Department of
Corrections' Law Enforcement and Investigative Unit.</LD>
<LD>   Three handguns belonging to Jackson, including one believed to be
the murder weapon, were also recovered, said Capt. Bob McNamara of
the LAPD's Van Nuys Division.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson was charged earlier this week with two counts of murder
with a special circumstance in connection with the slayings of Carlos
Avalos, 44, of Van Nuys and Francisco Mercado, 34, of Pacoima. He was
arraigned Friday in Van Nuys Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the two victims were shot Sunday after Jackson, a
regular customer of the store, was told he could not return brake
pads.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that Jackson left the store and later returned,
driving a different vehicle and wearing different clothes, and fired
several shots at the two employees.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities traced that vehicle's license plate and then tracked
down a known associate of Jackson's in Canyon Country, setting up a
surveillance of the associate's residence.</TE>
<TE>   They moved in Thursday night and in minutes negotiated Jackson's
surrender, McNamara said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who is being held without bail, has a criminal record
with at least three felony convictions, including assault with a
deadly weapon on a police officer and armed robbery, McNamara said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Jackson has been in and out of state prison since
the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Report Shows Plenty of Jobs</HD>
<DH>County unemployment rate rose slightly in October compared
with last year, but is still low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County posted its third-lowest October unemployment rate in
20 years last month, indicating that just about anyone in the county
who wants to work can find a job, an economic analyst said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "People are fully employed," said Mark Schniepp, director of the
California Economic Forecast Project at UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   The October rate was 5.4%, compared with 4.9% a year ago, when the
county was enjoying a robust economic rebound.</LD>
<TE>   The number of jobs in the county dropped by 2,800 between October
2001 and 2002, with most of the decline in farm work.</TE>
<TE>   In nonfarm jobs, five areas posted declines. The service industry
lost 800 jobs, construction 400, manufacturing 300, wholesale trade
300 and transportation and public utilities 100.</TE>
<TE>   But other areas saw an increase during the same period. Finance,
insurance and real estate, all lumped into a single industry category
by statisticians, saw a rise of 500 jobs, while government also rose
by 500 jobs and retail grew by 400 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Real estate is going really nuts right now, and it's contributing
a little bit to jobs," Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   Although people are working, Ventura County isn't experiencing
dynamic job growth because its costly housing market is blunting
expansion by private companies, Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that in a time of low unemployment, we're also seeing
low job gains?" Schniepp said. "You would see more jobs being created
right now, I imagine, if we had housing that was more affordable. You
can't hire the people who already live here because they already have
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The median home price in Ventura County is $333,000.</TE>
<TE>   "When the economy picks up nationwide and statewide, Ventura
County firms are going to need to grow and hire," Schniepp said. "It
hasn't hit yet, but they'll be facing some very tough decisions about
whether to stay in Ventura County or move. There will be more
defections over time if the housing crisis continues."</TE>
<TE>   The county ranks 21st in joblessness among the state's 58
counties. October's unemployment rate was 6.2% statewide and 5.3%
nationally.</TE>

<HD>Korenstein Joins Race for 12th Council District</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein announced Friday
that she is entering the already crowded race for the 12th District
seat on the Los Angeles City Council, which is being vacated by Hal
Bernson because of term limits.</LD>
<LD>   The seat represents the northwest San Fernando Valley communities
of Northridge, Granada Hills, Chatsworth and Porter Ranch.</LD>
<LD>   Although she narrowly lost a 1991 bid for the seat, Korenstein
said she is confident she can prevail in a field that includes
Bernson's chief-of-staff Greig Smith, former Republican Assemblywoman
Paula Boland, businessman Robert Vinson, teacher Norman Huberman,
attorney Ken Aslan and accountant Armineh Safarian Chelebian.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something I've always wanted to do," said Korenstein, a
Porter Ranch resident. "I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think I could
win. It's going to be an aggressive campaign but I'm ready for it."</TE>
<TE>   She says her goal is to make the Valley more family friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein has served on the board for the Los Angeles Unified
School District for 16 years. Her current term expires in 2005, but
she does not have to give up her school board seat to run for
council.</TE>
<TE>   Although the council contest is nonpartisan, Korenstein said she
is the first prominent Democrat in the race in a district where
Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5%.</TE>
<TE>   The race is shaping up to be one of the most competitive in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Boland recently was the top vote-getter, at 42%, among 13
candidates for the 3rd District seat on the proposed San Fernando
Valley city council. The defeat of the secession measure negated the
need for a council.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for filing declarations of intent to run for the Los
Angeles City Council is today.</TE>

<HD>Flier Attacking Villaraigosa Called 'Racist'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The same day Antonio Villaraigosa announced he was running for Los
Angeles City Council, voters received a racially charged attack
mailer seeking to undermine his support in the Latino community by
accusing him of betraying Latino constituents at the urging of his
"white advisors."</LD>
<LD>   Although there was no name disclosing who sent out the glossy
flier, attorney Ricardo A. Torres II -- a staunch supporter of
Villaraigosa's opponent, Councilman Nick Pacheco -- said in an
interview late Friday that he spent $5,000 to send out 10,000 mailers
to newly registered Latino voters in the 14th City Council District.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Pacheco said the councilman had not yet seen the
flier. Pacheco could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Torres, who went to law school with Pacheco, said he plans to
raise $500,000 to send out two mailers a week blasting Villaraigosa
until the former mayoral candidate abandons his bid to represent
District 14, which includes parts of Boyle Heights, Highland Park,
Eagle Rock and Mount Washington. He warned that the mailers will
become increasingly derogatory in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, Nick Pacheco is a better candidate for this job,"
said Torres, who describes himself as Villaraigosa's "enemy."</TE>
<TE>   "I ran into Antonio recently at the theater, and I said to him,
'Give me a reason why you are running.' He said, 'Because I need to
run.' ... Because of that, I decided I was going to exercise my
constitutional right to speak out."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said he was disgusted by the mailer, which he called
"racist."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no place in American politics for ugly racial attacks
like this, whether they are targeted at whites, Latinos, Asians or
blacks," said Villaraigosa, who announced his candidacy Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer -- which began arriving at district households Thursday
-- has a picture of Villaraigosa with green dollar signs over his
eyes. "Antonio Villaraigosa ignored us before when his white advisors
said he didn't need Latinos," the mailer said.</TE>
<TE>   The piece -- written in both Spanish and English -- goes on to
criticize Villaraigosa for supporting Gov. Gray Davis, who recently
vetoed a bill that would have allowed some illegal immigrants to get
California driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "After breaking his promise to State Legislators, Gray Davis sent
Antonio Villaraigosa on television ... where his pocho Spanish
Antonio proudly claimed that Davis was 'Nuestro Mejor Amigo (Our Best
Friend).' " ("Pocho" is a derogatory term used to describe Mexican
Americans who do not speak Spanish and who only claim to be Latino
when it's convenient.)</TE>
<TE>   The piece further stated that Villaraigosa's actions proved that
he "listened to the white consultants pulling his strings."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, who voted to support efforts to issue driver's
licenses to certain illegal immigrants when he was in the state
Assembly, said he holds Pacheco responsible for the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Pacheco has proven that, once again, he and his operatives
engage in the worst kind of negative campaigning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disgusting that Pacheco's supporters would resort to sending
out anti-white mailers to Latino voters. We should be working in this
city to bring all Angelenos together -- not divide people based on
race and ethnicity."</TE>
<TE>   Political strategist Rick Taylor said he believes the attack
mailer against Villaraigosa could backfire on Pacheco.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick said from day one that this would be a very tough,
aggressive campaign," Taylor said. "But there's a limit, and racism
works both ways. This is clearly crossing the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Pacheco should denounce this mailer if he has nothing to do
with it," Taylor added. "I'm sure somebody is sitting back in a room
tonight, laughing, thinking, 'This is great.' But these are the kinds
of mistakes that could cost Pacheco the campaign."</TE>

<HD>Memorial Unveiling Postponed</HD>
<DH>Fund shortage means tribute to Vietnam vets won't be
finished until early 2003.</DH>

<LD>A fund-raising shortfall has stalled the completion of a Vietnam War
memorial in Westminster, postponing Friday's planned dedication to
spring.</LD>
<LD>   Cloaked in canvas and duct tape in an otherwise barren park, a
pair of 15-foot, solemn-looking bronze soldiers awaits the addition
of a black-marble fountain, a memorial urn and flags of the United
States and the former South Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   Considered the first memorial to honor troops from the United
States and Vietnam, it is now scheduled for formal unveiling April
26, four days before the 28th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.</LD>
<TE>   A Nov. 24 performance at the memorial site by a group of
Vietnamese American singers is expected to raise $150,000 to complete
the memorial, with work to be finished about two months later.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial committee members said they wanted time before the
dedication to send out invitations to dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor Tuan Nguyen said he understands donors' irritation about
the delays in the four-year project.</TE>
<TE>   "I see their frustration as a sign of how much they care," he
said. "But when you look at the 13 years [the] Pearl Harbor
[Memorial] took to be built, we're doing pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   To protect the bronze soldiers from vandalism, volunteers from
former South Vietnamese veterans groups stand watch from 6 p.m. to 7
a.m. every day.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial committee spokesman Joey Nguyen said the panel will try
to find another means of protecting the statues as winter looms.</TE>
<TE>   Tuan Nguyen visits the sculpture some evenings to encourage the
volunteers, some of whom are in their 70s and 80s.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts me to see how they live in fear," he said. "But it's
moving ... that the memorial already means so much."</TE>

<HD>The Republicans Finally Get a Break in California, and It's
Lincoln's Nose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Southern California, even the statues get nose jobs. Of course, in
this case, a granite Abe Lincoln's schnoz had actually been lopped
off earlier by some high-pressure washing equipment in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   So, Palms-based Sculpture Conservation Studio was hired to put Abe
back together (see photo). Luckily, no spare parts were needed. "They
[the city] brought us the original nose," said the company's Michael
Reinis. "It was slightly damaged, but we were able to put it back
on."</LD>
<LD>   Of course it wasn't quite that easy. Holes had to be drilled into
Abe's nose and head. The two were reattached via steel rods that were
held in place by epoxy.</LD>
<TE>   I visited the statue during the rainstorm Friday. The rest of the
Southland might have been falling apart, but the downpour hadn't
washed away the nose.</TE>
<TE>   Body parts (cont.): The Lincoln operation reminded me of an ad
spotted by Donald Benjamin of Rowland Heights (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Not sure whether the shop removes wax or dirt.</TE>
<TE>   SWD seeks soul mate who doesn't drool too much: Tom Greene of Echo
Park happened upon an unusual singles ad posted in his neighborhood
(see excerpt). The owner described her white pit bull as well
mannered, polite and a virgin (he's an indoor dog). She asked that
"no mean or unpredictable dogs" apply. Commented Greene: "Being a
writer-producer, I'm ashamed to say I had a fleeting thought to set
up a pitch meeting at Fox. I mean really, is this any different from
'Meet The Parents'?"</TE>
<TE>   Unrelated item: Paul Schowalter of Cypress found a damaged sign
that had acquired an unintended meaning (see photo). And I'm sure it
was just a coincidence that the sign was in Sacramento, where the
state Legislature does its business.</TE>
<TE>   OK, some people find classical music boring ... including,
perhaps, the printer of a concert program that Celia Brink of Cardiff
came across. Maybe that would explain why one performer was described
as a "painist."</TE>
<TE>   What a slip! I've written about Ken Bannister's Banana Museum in
Altadena, and its 17,000 collectibles, and I admit I've implied that
Southern California is the capital of bananamania. But a Canadian
performance artist who calls herself Anna Bananas provides convincing
evidence to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed to a "German banana consciousness" over the last
decade, with at least two museums in that nation dedicated to the
fruit. And then there is Bananas herself, who stages street
performances she calls "Bananas in Distress."</TE>
<TE>   She runs through a crosswalk and has her suitcase fly open leaving
"several dozen banana items spread out onto the sidewalk." She
appeals to passersby, " 'Help me save my bananas!' It's quite
hilarious to see who pitches in, who pulls away. When they are all
packed, I award Degrees of Bananology to those who helped."</TE>
<TE>   And me? I'm green with embarrassment that I was so provincial.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Cal State Fullerton student Pape Sow worked as a
lifeguard at the university pool and had the ideal build for the
position. He stands 6 feet 11, meaning he could keep his head above
the water for the entire length of the pool, reports the school's
publication, Titan. I'm sure there's a dunking joke in there
somewhere.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Shed Light on Sea Caves' Wildlife</HD>
<DH>Biologists tell kayak guides about rare birds so paddlers
can avoid harming the creatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After paddling from bright sunshine into a darkened sea cave, it
takes a bit for the eyes to adjust. In that moment, other senses
sharpen to fill the void.</LD>
<LD>   The damp air feels cooler inside, as the cave exhales to make room
for a swell rolling in behind you. The air seems saltier too, so
tangy you can taste it. The craggy walls muffle the ocean's roar,
allowing the ears to tune to the sound of waves sloshing softly
against roughly hewn rock.</LD>
<LD>   Then the calm is shattered by the furious beating of wings and an
alarmed, piercing trill. A pigeon guillemot bolts for the cave's
mouth, leaving its nest behind.</LD>
<TE>   "If you go into a cave with birds flying in and out with fish in
their mouth, then there are chicks in there," explains Paige Martin,
a National Park Service seabird biologist. "It's a good idea to move
along and go to the next cave."</TE>
<TE>   Martin and a team of other biologists and park rangers are leading
a guided tour of Santa Cruz Island's sea caves. It's not a session
for amateurs, but for outfitters and kayak guides. It's not a session
they can afford to miss, because it may determine where they can take
their kayaking clients and what places will be off limits.</TE>
<TE>   Ocean kayaking is surging in popularity, up 30% or more a year at
Channel Islands National Park. Some of the biggest attractions are
the sea caves, each one fascinating in its own way.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a few species of seabirds that nest in and
around the caves are struggling for survival. One of them, the
Xantus's murrelet, recently became a candidate for protection under
the state's endangered-species law.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, ocean kayaking has been the kind of low-impact sport
that fits neatly into the park service's definition of
environmentally benign recreation. Park service officials want to
make sure it stays that way.</TE>
<TE>   To that end Supt. Tim Setnicka, former superintendent of Channel
Islands National Park, has rounded up kayaking guides and biologists
and marooned them on the island -- for a day. In particular, he wants
them to be sensitive to the needs of wildlife inhabiting the sea
caves that are so popular with kayakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to solve this," he says, "on the basis of guides' talking
to the biologists, one to one."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides learn that, when it comes to identifying sea caves,
they often speak different languages.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists refer to caves by number, such as Cavern Point Cave No.
4. Kayaking guides have their own nicknames for the caves.</TE>
<TE>   One popular cave of many names burrows through an islet attached
to Scorpion Rock. Some call it "Birth," a shortened reference to the
narrow rear exit, which is like a birth canal. To slide through the
canal, kayakers must lie nearly flat on their backs to avoid getting
squeezed against the sloping ceiling and narrowing walls. Some emerge
bleeding after brushes with the pitted, barnacle-studded rock, which
can shred exposed skin like a cheese grater.</TE>
<TE>   To their relief, biologists and kayakers learn that the caves that
attract the rarest birds hold little or no attraction to the guides
and their paddling customers.</TE>
<TE>   Bat Cave and Cavern Point Cove Cave -- both "dry caves," with dry
rock or sandy bottoms -- are common nesting sites for the Xantus's
murrelet and the ashy storm petrel, another seabird of special
concern.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned about people getting out of their boats and
walking into these caves," Martin says. "They may step on birds they
cannot see, or step on a log that will crush a bird, an egg or a
chick."</TE>
<TE>   But Eric Little, owner of Aquasports, says his customers are
interested in paddling, not awkwardly hoisting themselves out of
their boats and walking around in cramped places. "We're really just
interested in the wet caves," he says.</TE>
<TE>   (Since the meeting, the park service has closed both of the dry
caves. It will soon issue a public bulletin with a map to pinpoint
the new restrictions.)</TE>
<TE>   Much of the discussion during the day on Santa Cruz Island is
spent figuring out what sort of activity disturbs the murrelets, the
ashy storm petrels, the pigeon guillemots, brown pelicans and
Brandt's cormorants that nest inside caves and on the rocky cliffs
around them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you flush a bird from a cave, is that a disturbance?" Little
asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Kayaking is fairly low impact," says Mike Lamm, co-owner of
Channel Islands Kayak Center. "Do you have concerns about noise
volume? About people talking?"</TE>
<TE>   The biologists aren't sure where to draw the line. But they agree
that repeated disruptions to nest-sitting, breeding or feeding can
make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "You may not think that you are disturbing them," says Nora Rojek,
a seabird biologist for the California Department of Fish and Game.
"But a lot of these birds nest in the same exact crevice year after
year. If they are disturbed too many times, they'll just leave."</TE>
<TE>   There is no disagreement over what to do about a bird with a fish
in its mouth. Move on. The bird is trying to get back to the nest to
feed its young.</TE>
<TE>   The guides, all of whom hold permits from the park service, appear
eager to do their part. Many of their customers are bird-watchers.
Others come to see wildlife and to soak up the beauty of a place that
adventure magazines often include in the top 10 kayaking spots in
America. So they consider wildlife protection to be in their own
self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   Park rangers and biologists remain concerned about kayakers or
boaters who set off on their own without licensed guides. The
concessionaires agree to help with that too.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out there all of the time," Little says. "It's easy to
holler to people and say, 'Hey, don't go in there. It's a federal
offense.' We can't enforce it, but we can inform the public."</TE>
<TE>   On the boat ride back to the mainland, Setnicka seems to be
pleased with his marooning project. "These guys," he says of the
kayakers, "are going to be warriors for the wildlife."</TE>

<HD>Former Teacher Admits Abuse</HD>
<DH>Ex-Camarillo High educator pleads guilty to molesting 11
teenage boys -- nine of them students at the school -- over two
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Camarillo High School teacher pleaded guilty Friday to sex
crimes involving students, admitting he molested 11 teenage boys over
two years.</LD>
<LD>   Nine of those sexually assaulted by Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 31,
were students at Camarillo High when he taught upper-level science
and coached boys' tennis and soccer. He met two other boys in an
Internet chat room.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting at the defense table with his head bowed and speaking
softly, Pridgen pleaded guilty to 20 felony and misdemeanor charges
and no contest to three of the 39 charges he initially faced.</LD>
<TE>   Charges include allegations that Pridgen supplied teenagers with
alcohol, had oral sex with minors, showed them pornography and
behaved lewdly in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the sex acts occurred at Pridgen's Camarillo home,
where the teacher frequently had students over for after-school and
weekend parties.</TE>
<TE>   He is to be sentenced Jan. 17 in Ventura County Superior Court,
and faces a maximum of 13 years in state prison. He remains free on
$500,000 bail until sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley, who accused Pridgen of using
his authority as a teacher to take advantage of teenage boys,
stressed that Friday's action was not the result of a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very pleased with the result," Ridley said outside court
Friday. "We felt this spared the victims having to testify without
compromising anything."</TE>
<TE>   The father of two victims said he was relieved to see Pridgen
admit to the charges after six months of delayed hearings and
seemingly little progress.</TE>
<TE>   He said the case has torn the family apart and will hurt long
after Pridgen is sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my boys to be able to stand up and let him know how they
feel," he said. "It's not just us -- this has hurt a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorney, Paul Takakjian, did not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's plea came before any evidence in the case was presented
in a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley said it is standard to give sexual-assault defendants the
option of admitting to half of the charges against them.</TE>
<TE>   He would not comment on whether he would push for a maximum
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's plea, Pridgen's legal troubles are far from over.
Pridgen is also named in a lawsuit that seeks millions of dollars in
damages from the Oxnard Union High School District, where he was
employed as a teacher and coach for six years before his arrest Feb.
5.</TE>
<TE>   Seven teenage boys and their families have accused school and
district officials of ignoring complaints brought against Pridgen at
least two years before he was charged with molesting students.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence includes a tape-recorded meeting between parents and
Camarillo High administrators and a letter of concern written to the
principal by another coach at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin DeNoce, the Ventura attorney whose firm uncovered that
evidence, said the school must be held accountable in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that Pridgen has accepted his responsibility, I would expect
the school district to accept their portion of the responsibility,"
said DeNoce, who represents the victims in the civil case.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen was arrested after a sheriff's investigation prompted by
one student, now 18.</TE>
<TE>   The youth said Pridgen showed him pornography in attempts to
seduce him, gave him alcohol and masturbated in front of him on
several occasions between the fall of 2000 and January 2002,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The student reported the alleged behavior to police after an
incident Jan. 31, when Pridgen asked the boy to see him after class
about assignments he had missed during an illness, the documents
indicated.</TE>
<TE>   The student told police Pridgen then asked him to engage in oral
sex with another student in exchange for "not giving him a bad grade
during the semester," the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Equipping the student with a concealed microphone and transmitter,
police heard Pridgen admit he had watched pornographic videos with
the boy and had bought him alcohol, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   When Pridgen was initially accused, many parents, teachers and
students swore to his innocence, testifying at a bail hearing that he
was a good person and an excellent citizen.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing Friday, parents of the victims said they felt the
teacher had betrayed them and the community.</TE>
<TE>   One father said his family invited Pridgen into their home many
times, including once for Thanksgiving dinner. "This is someone you
trust, and someone with authority," he said. "He's supposed to be a
role model."</TE>

<HD>File on Ryder Is Missing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Winona Ryder's case of sticky fingers contagious?</LD>
<LD>   A day after the film star was convicted of felony grand theft and
vandalism for shoplifting $5,560.40 in designer goods from Saks Fifth
Avenue in Beverly Hills, a confidential report turned up missing from
her file at the Santa Monica Courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Both Santa Monica police and the Los Angeles County Probation
Department are investigating the highly unusual case, according to
Ken Kondo, a Probation Department spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   The latest plot twist for the doe-eyed actress involves a possibly
purloined "pre-conviction report," which was being kept under wraps
in a locked file cabinet at the Probation Department's Santa Monica
area office.</TE>
<TE>   The document, reported missing late Thursday, is slated to become
public record for 90 days upon Ryder's sentencing, which is scheduled
for Dec. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder was convicted Wednesday of walking out of Saks with 20
items, including a $540 Natori handbag and an $80 pair of Donna Karan
socks in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The actress faces a possible three-year prison term but is almost
certain to get probation instead.</TE>
<TE>   Kondo said backup copies of the probation document exist.</TE>
<TE>   He would not reveal whether it contained any scintillating details
of the sort that might look right at home in, say, a supermarket
tabloid.</TE>
<TE>   The report covers such information as marital and financial
status, prior arrests, medical history, "facts of the offense" and
the Probation Department's sentencing recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were said to be investigating the possibility that a
court employee lifted the report to sell. Kondo sought to dispel at
least one rumor.</TE>
<TE>   "No one grabbed the file and ran out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "From our standpoint," he added, "we're very concerned that a
high-profile case has been tampered with."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Friday, a previously sealed court transcript of an Oct.
24 hearing was made public. It details prosecution efforts to
introduce evidence into Ryder's trial of three previous incidents in
which she allegedly walked out of department stores without paying
for items.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elden Fox, who had closed the hearing,
refused to allow the jury to hear evidence of Ryder's alleged actions
at the Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus in November 2001 and at Barneys
New York in Beverly Hills in May 2000 and October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In two of the incidents, which were videotaped, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Ann Rundle said, Ryder could be "seen doing the identical conduct" as
in Saks -- "selecting items, concealing those items underneath heavy
garment bags or underneath her own clothing, in and out of the
dressing rooms, and ultimately walking out of the store without
paying for the items."</TE>
<TE>   Rundle also told the judge that in one case, Ryder "was seen by
security selecting a hat, wandering around the store with a hat, and
then walking out the door with the hat on her head without paying for
it."</TE>
<TE>   Rundle argued that introducing such evidence to the jury was
important, because it would help show Ryder did not make a mistake
when she left Saks with items she had not paid for.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos countered that his client had "never
been detained. She's never been arrested."</TE>
<TE>   Calling the Saks case weak, Geragos said the evidence of the other
incidents was "more garbage."</TE>
<TE>   Fox ruled against letting the jurors hear of the prior acts,
saying it would be "far more prejudicial than probative."</TE>
<TE>   The judge released the transcripts of the closed October hearing
in response to a state appeals court decision in a case brought by
The Times, Associated Press and the Los Angeles Daily Journal.</TE>

<HD>Season's First Storm Turns Out to Be Curse and Blessing</HD>
<DH>The rain eases the fire danger in Southern California, but
it sparks accidents, churns up big waves and knocks out power to
many.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Parts of California seemed to be getting all the rain that nature
withheld the past year as a Pacific storm swept the state, drenching
the Bay Area, ending fire closures in two Southland national forests
and sending a car hydroplaning into four people at a bus stop in
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The storm, which brought the Los Angeles Basin its first
significant rainfall in almost 10 months, spanned much of the West
Coast. Waves, some approaching 30 feet, crashed along the shore, the
Sierra Nevada braced for up to 4 feet of snow, and power outages hit
San Francisco and nearly 100,000 Southern California Edison
customers.</LD>
<LD>   "The farther north you go, the heavier it is," said Stuart Seto of
the National Weather Service. "It has not gone very far inland or
very far south of Los Angeles in heavy amounts."</LD>
<TE>   At its most potent in Central and Northern California, the
season's first storm poured up to 4 inches of rain on the San Luis
Obispo County coast and pounded the San Francisco Bay Area and parts
of Ventura County with 6 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty intense storm for the first storm of the season,"
Seto said. "It's been 283 days since we last had more than half an
inch in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This is a good
ground-soaker."</TE>
<TE>   The rainfall is expected to taper off today, leaving partly cloudy
skies on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   An inch to 1 1/2 inches of rain fell in the basin, where it was
desperately needed after last year, the driest season in Los Angeles
since record-keeping began in 1877. Dust-cloaked hillsides received a
dousing, and Southern California national forests closed to
recreational use in September because of extreme fire danger were
reopened Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes said the recreational
ban was lifted in almost all of the Angeles National Forest and parts
of the San Bernardino National Forest. The Cleveland National Forest
in San Diego County, where little rain has fallen, remained closed.</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Beach, a driver lost control on rain-slick Beach
Boulevard at 6:30 p.m. and crashed into a bus shelter. One man was
trapped briefly under the collapsed shelter and suffered a critical
head injury. Three other people also were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   The driver and his passenger had been en route to a square dance
when he tried to change lanes and the car lost traction.</TE>
<TE>   "It just kept going round and round and round," said passenger
Madeline Reid, 63.</TE>
<TE>   Near Corona, the driver of a charter bus on Interstate 15 lost
control of the vehicle on the slick roadway about 1 a.m. Friday, and
the bus skidded on its side into the median, according to the
California Highway Patrol. The driver and 35 passengers, who were
returning to Monterey Park from an Indian casino, sustained minor to
moderate injuries. They were treated at seven hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, a one-story duplex slid down a slight slope onto
a gas meter Friday evening, prompting authorities to evacuate nearby
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Two people were inside and heard a creaking, cracking noise and
they exited and it slid," Fire Chief Mike Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   The 4th Street house, which was not bolted to the foundation,
separated at its raised floor, Curtis said. It was not immediately
clear if rain was the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also did not know if the predawn crash of a small
plane Friday near the 91 Freeway was related to the bad weather. The
pilot, alone aboard the plane, was killed.</TE>
<TE>   And in South Lake Tahoe, a large tree crashed onto a vehicle
traveling along a snowy trans-Sierra highway Friday evening, killing
two people and forcing closure of the road for three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 6 inches of rain soaked Ventura County, temporarily closing
a key Ventura Freeway bridge and causing road flooding, minor damage
to buildings, dozens of car crashes and effectively ending a long
fire season.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic backed up for miles Friday morning after the CHP closed
the Santa Clara River Bridge for 45 minutes, fearing that heavy rain
and construction work had undermined bridge supports.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Rice, a Ventura title company employee, was taking her car
to Camarillo for service when she approached the bridge at about 45
mph. She said she hit a slick spot in the road, spun around twice and
slammed into a retaining wall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty horrifying out here," she said from the roadside
shortly after the crash. "It's pouring down rain, traffic is backed
up, and I just wrecked my BMW pretty severely. Now I'm waiting for a
tow truck and a rent-a-car."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 4 inches of rain pummeled the Ojai area overnight, and
about 2 inches fell on the coastal plains from Ventura to Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the storm -- the heaviest to hit Ventura County
since the floods of 1998 -- were felt throughout the area: a post
office was slightly damaged in Oxnard; a couple were rescued after
their car settled into 2 feet of water at Camarillo Springs; and
streets were overflowing in flood-prone areas such as El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Above Ojai, the Los Padres National Forest reopened campgrounds
that had been closed because of the fire danger.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, two jackknifed big-rigs caused a
three-car collision on the rain-slick eastbound Ronald Reagan Freeway
in Chatsworth on Friday afternoon, prompting the CHP to close the
roadway for 40 minutes, said Officer John Seumanutafa. No injuries
were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Van Nuys residents were without electricity for
several hours early Friday morning, while nearly 100,000 Southern
California Edison customers scattered from Victorville to Ventura
County have experienced outages lasting a few seconds to several
hours since the storm arrived Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   As the storm moved across the state, emergency managers were
attending a Sacramento briefing on the upcoming El Nino season, which
is expected to be weak but nonetheless exert an influence on weather
across parts of the United States from December to February.</TE>
<TE>   John Janowiak of the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction
Center in Maryland told state officials to expect above-normal
precipitation in the southern half of California. He said the
north-central part of the country and Alaska could experience milder
than usual temperatures this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Now brewing in the equatorial Pacific, this year's El Nino, a
warming of ocean waters that alters weather patterns, is not expected
to be as severe as the 1997-98 season. The effects of weak to
moderate El Ninos are more of a toss-up, said Kelly Redmond of the
Western Regional Climate Center in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   "El Nino does not necessarily have to be strong to cause
disruptive or memorable weather in parts of the state," he cautioned.</TE>

<LD>A surprisingly strong Pacific storm poured up to 6 inches of rain on
parched Ventura County Friday, temporarily closing a key Ventura

dozens of car crashes and effectively ending a long fire season.</LD>
<LD>   Traffic backed up for nearly 10 miles Friday morning after the

inches of precipitation on the Ojai area and 2 to 3 inches on the
coastal plains from Ventura to Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   It rained steadily Friday. And forecasters predict the rain will
continue through tonight. Up to 8 inches of rain are expected in the
mountains above Ojai by the time the storm ends tonight, and coastal
areas could receive 5 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "The jet stream and the moisture plume and the speed of this thing
-- it slowed down when it hit -- made this a much bigger storm," said
weather specialist Stuart Seto at the National Weather Service office
in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The original forecast was for less than 2 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The storm emerged from an intensive low-pressure system off the
Canadian coast and has dropped rain as far south as Cabo San Lucas,
Mexico, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the storm -- the heaviest here since the floods of
1998 -- were felt throughout the county. A post office was slightly
damaged and a museum flooded in Oxnard; the roof leaked at Rains
department store in Ojai; a couple were rescued after their car
settled into 2 feet of water at Camarillo Springs; and streets were
overflowing in flood-prone areas such as El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 collisions and fender-benders were reported in the
county Friday. No major injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   "The rain has been good and bad," said Joe Luna, a spokesman for
the Ventura County Fire Department. "It has definitely minimized fire
danger, but the roads are incredibly slippery."</TE>
<TE>   The storm is bringing an end to the high-fire season in Los Padres
National Forest, and a campfire ban will be lifted Wednesday,
officials announced.</TE>
<TE>   "We really consider Los Padres National Forest to be in fire
season year-round, but the recent rain has lessened those
restrictions," said Kathy Good, a spokeswoman for Los Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Rains forced closure of the slow lane on the northbound Ventura
Freeway at the Santa Clara bridge through Friday afternoon, according
to California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jeanne
Bonfilio. There was also damage to the slope beneath the freeway,
prompting traffic on Ventura Road to be diverted for much of the day,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the storm-related accidents, police said most drivers
heeded warnings about slowing down during wet weather.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been driving around, and it actually looks like people are
being cautious today," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Eric
Nishimoto. "I didn't see the knuckleheads out there driving too fast,
like they usually do in the rain." Portions of Ventura Road near
Wagon Wheel Road in Oxnard were flooded, but most streets were clear,
said Denise Hamilton, an Oxnard police spokeswoman. Vehicles got
through the flooded area, "but they're going through slowly."</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Weather Service, it will be breezy
today, with south to southwesterly winds of 30 to 42 mph and
occasional strong gusts. The Coast Guard has issued a small-craft
advisory.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hendrick, a store merchandiser at Rains in Ojai, came to
work Friday to find about 2 inches of water in the back of the store.</TE>
<TE>   Rains is under construction, and there was a temporary plastic
roof where workers are building an addition to the store, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The roof just gave way under all that rain, and the water ran
into the whole back of our store," Hendrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the housewares items and boxes were wet, but there was
minimal damage to merchandise, Hendrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at an Oxnard post office on Saviers Road also had a
flood on their hands early Friday after a ceiling tile fell and left
a 20-foot-wide puddle in the lobby. The mess was cleaned in less than
an hour, said supervisor Russ Partee.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2 inches of rainwater flooded the basement of the
Carnegie Art Museum in downtown Oxnard, where dozens of paintings,
charcoal sketches and other drawings were stored.</TE>
<TE>   Employees and firefighters hauled the artwork to the upper floors
and used vacuums to remove the standing water. The amount of damage
had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   "The water didn't reach the art, but there were concerns about the
increase in humidity and whether it would damage the works," said
Oxnard Fire Engineer Don Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   It took a crew of a dozen people nearly two hours to clean the
mess. The nonstop precipitation has been a blessing for the county's
farmers, who hadn't seen rain since January.</TE>
<TE>   "This storm is one of the best things that could have happened to
us," said Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail. "I
didn't expect it to be like this until December or January."</TE>
<TE>   McPhail said the dry fields had no problem absorbing more rain
than originally expected. There was limited runoff, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Environmental Health Division, though, issued a
warning that storm water runoff can carry disease-causing bacteria to
beaches and ocean waters and that people should stay out of the water
for a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   But surfers turned out anyway, taking advantage of 10- to 12-foot
waves.</TE>
<TE>   The rain left the air clean.</TE>
<TE>   "At times like this, our air is as clean as it is in a place like
North Dakota," said Mallory Ham of the county's Air Pollution Control
District.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials made empty bags and piles of sand available at most
fire stations. As of Friday afternoon, only a dozen home and business
owners had stopped by for sandbags.</TE>
