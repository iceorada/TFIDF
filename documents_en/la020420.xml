<HD>As 'X-Files,' 'Ally' End, Fox in a Fix</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Even with the network's critically lauded comedy
'Bernie Mac' and serialized drama '24,' next season could be thin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox has scheduled another of its "Magic's Secrets Finally Revealed"
specials to run during May, explaining how magician David Blaine
pulled off the stunt in which he buried himself in ice.</LD>
<LD>   What the network's executives might want to uncover, while they're
at it, is who cast the spell that put a chill on their ratings.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement this week that "Ally McBeal" would join "The
X-Files" in ending its run next month represents a one-two punch to
Fox, as the network loses two shows that were once darlings with
viewers and critics but whose ratings--even allowing for a flurry of
cast changes--have plunged this season.</LD>
<TE>   For a network that provides only 15 hours per week of national
programming in prime time (as opposed to the 22 hours scheduled by
ABC, CBS and NBC), the departure of those two programs, coupled with
other problem spots on its schedule, places Fox in an unenviable
position: having to potentially add more hours of new series next
fall than can easily be promoted and advertised in today's fragmented
media marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   With "The X-Files" and "Ally" exiting its lineup, Fox's roster of
well-established series returning next season looks thin, including
the tireless "The Simpsons," "Malcolm in the Middle" (which will
likely be moved off of Sundays in the fall to help shore up another
night), "Ally" creator David E. Kelley's "Boston Public," "That '70s
Show," and the unsung Saturday-night tandem of "Cops" and "America's
Most Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Fox's troubles have escaped attention because they
have been overshadowed by ABC, whose widely reported ratings descent
has dominated talk within the entertainment industry through much of
the current television season--fueled both by the decline of "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" and the changing cast within its
management soap opera, including the replacement of programming chief
Stu Bloomberg in January.</TE>
<TE>   Fox also benefited from televising the most-watched World Series
in years last fall as well as the Super Bowl in February, buoying its
ratings average and thus masking some of its deficiencies. Since the
Super Bowl telecast, however, the network has averaged 7.7 million
viewers per week in prime time, an 18% drop versus the corresponding
period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The irony, if not especially surprising, is that Fox's woes come
during a season in which many critics who bashed the network in the
past have enthusiastically embraced some of its programming,
including the new comedy "The Bernie Mac Show"--which recently won a
prestigious Peabody Award--and the serialized drama "24," starring
Kiefer Sutherland.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the latter has struggled to find viewers in a difficult
Tuesday time slot, and if the series returns it might be revised to a
more conventional format, as opposed to the device of each episode
representing one hour in an especially busy day. On the plus side,
the show performs disproportionately well among affluent and
better-educated viewers, an attribute that makes programs such as
NBC's "The West Wing" more appealing to advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs for which the network once harbored high hopes
could also be in jeopardy, among them "Dark Angel," the
science-fiction series produced by "Titanic" director James Cameron,
who--trying to improve the program's chances for a third
year--directed its upcoming season finale.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to jump-start its ratings, Fox could always unleash
its executive vice president in charge of specials and alternative
series, Mike Darnell, whose ability to tap into the zeitgeist has
given rise to "When Animals Attack," "Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?," "Temptation Island" and now "Celebrity Boxing."
Yet even with Fox's renegade image, Darnell's concoctions come at a
potential price to the network's image and, in their more extreme
incarnations, tend to scare away blue-chip advertisers, muting
whatever short-term boost they provide.</TE>
<TE>   Fox officials note that the ratings swoon by "The X-Files" and
"Ally McBeal" already has somewhat lowered the bar in terms of
replacing them, with another new series from Kelley as well as a show
from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss Whedon among candidates
being considered as the network prepares to announce its fall 2002
prime-time lineup next month.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment President Gail Berman said the network
understands it is in a rebuilding mode that requires a level of
patience. "Quality is something that takes off in an almost viral way
on television. It takes time," she said. "It's a snowball effect."</TE>
<TE>   Still, patience is not one of the TV business' foremost
personality traits. As for turning to so-called "reality"
programming--on the order of "Temptation Island," which soared last
season but fizzled when brought back for a second round--Berman noted
that the goal is to achieve balance, using such fare "to round out
the schedule, as opposed to being the schedule."</TE>
<TE>   In short, Fox needs to look beyond stunts and gimmicks and focus
on finding new hits capable of supplanting the ones it's losing. And
while that's true for virtually all the networks, the latest
headlines provide another reminder that even for a sly Fox, there
might be no such thing as a quick fix.</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic's High-Spirited Evening of Mozart, More</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Returning to the podium of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, pianist and
conductor Christian Zacharias led the second-week's installment in
the brief More Than Mozart Festival.</LD>
<LD>   His unhackneyed program, during which he played two Mozart
concertos, offered four handsome works from the Classical era.</LD>
<LD>   The German conductor and a temporarily reduced orchestra lavished
an abundance of care and affection on Haydn's Symphony No. 80, and
the results filled the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with the composer's
inventive musicality.</LD>
<TE>   The temperamental opening movement changes modes, tempos, even
keys, with surprising rapidity, and Haydn's irrepressible zest
colored the finale wherein, unexpectedly, conductor Zacharias
surprised his audience by taking the final repeat, thus humorously
squelching the early clappers.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the evening was also high-spirited. It began with the
sober but charming Symphony in C minor by German composer Joseph
Martin Kraus, an almost exact contemporary (1756-92) of Mozart,
practically forgotten except in Sweden, where he thrived in his
prime.</TE>
<TE>   Zacharias' exceptional pianism--he has been much admired here,
since his debut with the Philharmonic in 1995--was on elegant display
in Mozart's Concertos Nos. 16 and 14, two pieces that seemed too much
alike to offer much contrast.</TE>
<TE>   The pianist's stylish and bravura playing impressed but was
undermined acoustically by the placement of the solo instrument, its
lid removed, facing the orchestra, the soloist with his back to the
audience. This achieved a nice blend but resulted in a lack of
clarity.</TE>

<HD>Argentina: First World Aspirations, Third World Finances</HD>
<DH>Movies*:Fellow directors Juan Jose Campanella and Fabian
Bielinsky look at their country in 'Son of the Bride,' 'Nine Queens.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Money is much on the minds of Argentines these days because of the
government's default on its loans and the collapse of its currency.
So it's not surprising that money factors heavily into two new films
from Argentina, the caper film "Nine Queens," which opened on Friday,
and the Oscar-nominated "Son of the Bride," which opened last month
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Obliquely and not so obliquely, both films dramatize the situation
in Argentina, a country with First World economic, social, and
cultural aspirations and a Third World wallet.</LD>
<LD>   "We were caught in that illusion," says "Nine Queens" director
Fabian Bielinsky. "We are Third World. Sometimes in our history we
thought we were not. Yeah, we don't look like them--our cities our
different, our middle class is larger--but at the end we discovered
we are Third World."</LD>
<TE>   To "Son of the Bride" director Juan Jose Campanella, fiscal
problems are a routine part of life in Argentina. "When wasn't there
a crisis here?" asks Campanella, who divides his time between Buenos
Aires and New York, where he directs episodes of "Law &amp; Order: SVU"
and "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent."</TE>
<TE>   "This one is harder and graver, but it's still one of the crises.
We went through hyperinflation, hyper-recession, the dollar was
cheaper, the dollar was expensive. We went through everything
economically in my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   One of the ironies of the current crisis, which actually began
several years ago, is that it has given a boost to Argentine
filmmakers by providing them with dramatic themes, although it hasn't
given birth to a peculiarly Argentine style of filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if it's not your intention, if you show your context in a
realistic manner, the more dramatic the context, the more interesting
the movie," Campanella says.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the Italians. Their one gift to the history of film was
Italian neo-realism, which came out of World War II. Of course, I
would rather have a great country with no film industry. You can
always make a film. Let's put it in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   As the films of Bielinsky and Campanella demonstrate, some of the
things they are talking about may be audible only to Argentines. For
example, "Son of the Bride" is about a restaurateur (Ricardo Darin)
who inherited the business from his immigrant father and has a
midlife crisis prompted by nasty vendors, a heart attack, his
mother's Alzheimer's, the demands of his girlfriend, the needs of his
daughter, and the hostility of his ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he bails out, dreaming of a sunny retirement in
Mexico. Certainly there is enough here for any viewer, but for
Argentines there is something more.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the whole thing with the restaurant was a metaphor for
the country, but it was always down there, as the second layer, this
rich country that we inherited from our parents and that we sold, and
now we have to start over in a broken-down cafe across the street,"
Campanella says.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, "Nine Queens," about a pair of con men (Darin again and
Gaston Pauls) who try to sell a forged set of rare stamps, is a genre
film, not a sociopolitical statement, but that didn't stop Argentine
audiences from reading between the lines.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the degree to which they did so surprised Bielinsky and
contributed to the film's popularity in Argentina. (It was released
there in August 2000 and took in $7 million at the box office.)</TE>
<TE>   "It was not my intention to [say,] 'Hey, I'm going make this a
reflection of our society, blah blah blah,'" says Bielinsky, who has
an extensive career as a commercial director in Argentina. "My
priority was to tell this swindlers' story as good as I could. And
then, of course, I knew that in my country, to talk about lying,
cheating, deceiving, etc., in some way is talking about us or a part
of our society."</TE>
<TE>   So, like Campanella, Bielinsky was well aware of the film's
subtext. He describes it, somewhat graphically, as a "smell--the
smell of pervasive corruption." Argentines, he said, are acutely
sensitive to it, having their noses rubbed in it every day.</TE>
<TE>   "The film as a whole could be described as a picture of a feeling
that, once in a while, every Argentine goes through, which is:
Everything is a lie, everybody is lying, nobody is honest, nobody is
going to tell me the truth," Bielinsky says. "It is not exactly
reality. We have a lot of honest people here, so it wouldn't be fair
to say that everybody lies, everybody cheats, everybody is thinking
of himself, there are no honest working people in my country."</TE>
<TE>   Lest Americans and other viewers find this context off-puttingly
Argentine, it should be said that the characters in these films are
recognizably middle and upper-middle class. Darin's character in "Son
of the Bride" lives in a posh flat, drives a fancy car and has his
ear glued to a cell phone. As Campanella puts it, he "has no
ideology, can't commit, rushes from one place to another, zaps
through television channels." He sounds like a character that Tom
Cruise or Richard Gere might play. Although Darin's character in
"Nine Queens" is more hand-to-mouth, he is by no means raffish.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bielinsky manages to play on a number of middle-class
concerns. He wanted middle-class audiences to identify with crooks,
which ties into the idea that some of those who are corrupt are
middle-class government functionaries. At the same time, the
worsening economy has inevitably hit the poor and thus increased
crime, so he has his two main characters performing scams on the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Campanella likens the upheaval in his country to the chaos of the
Great Depression and the disorder of the Vietnam War--both of which
generated great movies. In both cases, he says, the middle class was
affected, not just the poor and marginalized, which is when
significant changes can occur. He says the Argentine middle class has
brought down two presidents in recent months by taking to the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   While this ferment may have fed the Argentine film industry
artistically, the underlying economic reality could ultimately starve
it. Argentine films are funded largely by the government, which is
not exactly flush right now.</TE>
<TE>   Bielinsky sees slowing production as a consequence. In his view,
the best-case scenario is that foreign productions take advantage of
the cheap peso to shoot in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "Son of the Bride" may be Argentina's last gasp internationally,
at least for a while. Campanella says there was a lot of national
pride associated with his Oscar nomination. "I was in a cab [in
Buenos Aires] two days after the nominations came out," he says. "And
on the radio they started talking about the movie. And the cab driver
doesn't know who I am. And he says, 'I hope that at least his movie
gets an Oscar. Please, let's have one thing made by Argentines that's
considered good.'"</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it was not to be ("No Man's Land," from Bosnia-Herzegovina,
won the foreign-language film Oscar). Nothing comes that easily to
Argentina these days.</TE>

<HD>Lulled Into a Kinky Groove</HD>
<DH>Rhythms from the high-energy alt-rock Mexican band create a
funky trance that leaves fans wanting mas y mas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get Kinky, you have to let go.</LD>
<LD>   The alt-rock group by that name proved that point in its Los
Angeles debut Thursday, playing with the buoyant, nonstop exuberance
that has created such a buzz around this merry band of Mexicans in
the alternative music world. The quintet's thrilling, hourlong
concert, at Hollywood's sixteen fifty club, felt less like a series
of songs than one long, uninterrupted groove that carries listeners
along involuntarily.</LD>
<LD>   When Kinky starts concocting its overlapping patterns of rhythm
and electronic sounds, fans wait for the trance to take hold. When
band members start bouncing like jumping jacks, everybody bounces
with them. And when they release the built-up tension, the room
explodes with merriment and movement.</LD>
<TE>   Near the opening of the show, the group shouted the chorus from a
signature song, their voices escalating in tone and volume: "Vamos
queriendo mas y mas, mas y mas, mas y m-a-a-a-s."</TE>
<TE>   The line's ambiguous Spanish wording could mean an exhortation to
join the band in either wanting more, or loving more. Whether or not
they understood the language, the multiethnic mass got swept away by
the monosyllabic chanting for "more," seduced by the word's hypnotic
repetition to stop holding back.</TE>
<TE>   Too much thinking at a Kinky show spoils the fun.</TE>
<TE>   Kinky is a collective of five friends from Monterrey, Mexico, a
mecca for Latin alternative music. Seeing them live reveals why the
inventive group has generated such a groundswell of excitement since
winning a battle of the bands contest among unsigned acts at the
inaugural Latin Alternative Music Conference in New York in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The group, founded just months earlier in late 1999, sparked a
label bidding war and eventually signed with London-based Sonic360,
headed by Coldplay producer Chris Allison. Kinky's self-titled debut
album, just released in the U.S. by Nettwerk America, only captures a
fraction of its wild onstage frenzy, but it's still intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   In its attack on U.S. audiences, the group chooses to ignore
language conventions, which dictate that Latin artists should switch
to English to win crossover audiences. While sticking mostly to
Spanish, Kinky managed to stand out among bands performing at
Austin's recent South by Southwest music fest, winning rave notices
from critics.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to rise above all those barriers," said Ulises Lozano,
the band's keyboardist and programmer, during a tour stop in Santa
Barbara earlier this week. "Language should not matter here."</TE>
<TE>   That concept works because Kinky is primarily a dance band. Its
goal, Lozano explains, is to make sure "there's always that euphoria"
in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Members called themselves Kinky because they like the way the word
sounds. There's nothing perverse about their sparse, poetic lyrics,
nor their performance. On stage, they may whip up a wicked funk, but
they exude a wholesome, childlike joy.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, the name suggests they push the limits, but of genres.
Individually, their tastes sound more normal. Lozano loves German
electronica. Guitarist Carlos Chairez, also 30, is more of a rocker.
Percussionist Omar Gongora, 26, is an avid fan of Brazilian and
Afro-Cuban jazz, while bassist Cesar Pliego, 23, likes traditional
cumbias.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, it all fits together in a vibrant, natural amalgam. It's
like Monterrey itself, a city bristling with bands of all styles but
free of the judgmental barriers that keep genres and artists apart,
says the band.</TE>
<TE>   Singer and guitarist Gilberto Cerezo, 23, deceptively quiet off
stage, helped charge the crowd Thursday. He hopped around gleefully
and almost collided with his band mates, all bouncing about like
superheated molecules.</TE>
<TE>   Though his lyrics get lost in the excitement, Cerezo's love of
Latin American literature injects a dose of magic realism to the
group's songs, along with a cool sense of irony. The video of "Soun
Tha Mi Primer Amor" shows a hapless Cerezo riding a laconic horse
through a humble village, offering flowers from a rustic sack to
ungrateful or indifferent townsfolk. They scowl, slap him and throw
water in his face. The singer remains stoic, reciting his words of
passion passively. Finally, when a beautiful woman seems ready to
receive his offering, he discovers he has run out of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a happy theme, but it doesn't have a happy ending," says
Lozano of the video. "It contains something of that rural life, which
can be half cruel."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the real life the band members know in Monterrey, a
powerful and wealthy industrial capital of the border state of Nuevo
Leon. Their families are well-to-do, providing the encouragement to
pursue their musical careers, and the means to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano and Chairez first met in Los Angeles a few years ago during
a summer study program sponsored by Boston's Berklee College of
Music, which Lozano had attended. They had never met in their
hometown, making their foreign encounter as fortuitous as the sounds
they would eventually create together.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, they were joined by Cerezo, comprising an informal,
pre-Kinky nucleus that experimented with "underground" music. The
friends occasionally backed an experimental theater group called
Teoria de Gravedad (Theory of Gravity), improvising music to
constantly changing skits, surrounded by actors and even audience
members on stage. They thrived on the free format.</TE>
<TE>   "Kinky is a very visual band," says Chairez. "It's easy for us to
see something, and musicalize it. A single moment can fill a song."</TE>
<TE>   Despite critical acclaim, the band is still struggling to build a
following. Kinky played to half-empty clubs this week in San
Francisco, Santa Barbara and San Diego, traveling by car and eating
takeout pizzas for dinner on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in L.A. at daybreak Thursday, band members conducted
media interviews and an in-store appearance at the Amoeba Music store
in Hollywood before the show. By the time they took the stage that
night, they had been up for more than 24 hours. So where do they get
that energy?</TE>
<TE>   "We really enjoy playing together," says Lozano, who occasionally
straps on a norteno accordion during the show. "You don't get tired
that way."</TE>

<HD>What Drives Sorvino? Well, a Variety of Things</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memo to studios: Mira Sorvino is ready to do a big fat Hollywood
comedy. Anyone who has forgotten how funny Sorvino can be need only
see "The Triumph of Love," an 18th century screwball sex farce that
opened Wednesday in which she plays a princess bent on seducing a
pompous philosopher (Ben Kingsley) and his spinster sister (Fiona
Shaw) in order to restore her true love (Jay Rodan) to his rightful
place on the throne.</LD>
<LD>   Sorvino's comedic gifts have not been demonstrated much in recent
years. Most of the 17 films she's made since 1997's "Romy and
Michele's High School Reunion," released a year after she took home
the supporting actress Oscar for her role as the helium-voiced hooker
in "Mighty Aphrodite," have featured the New Jersey-bred actress in
serious roles.</LD>
<LD>   "Triumph" marks a highly theatrical return to comedic form, and
Sorvino says she's ready for more. "I can't predict what's going to
come across my desk, but I'd love to do a big comedy."</LD>
<TE>   Given its limited release by Paramount Classics, "Triumph" might
not qualify as a "big" movie, but Sorvino's role is super-sized. She
drives virtually every scene as the devious, gender-switching
Princess. "When I first read the script, I thought, 'Oh God, I can't
play this woman, I can't stand her, she's such a monster,'" says
Sorvino, sitting down for a bowl of seafood soup at a cafe in Malibu,
the community where she's lived for the past few months. "She's this
master manipulator who divines each character's true desire, figures
out what they really want to hear and then tells it to them."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of playing Princess/Phocion was elemental, she says.
"It's what you'd imagine as a little girl, you know: I got to be a
princess, I got to be a boy, and I got to do all these naughty things
and it was thrilling." Among the thrills: going toe to toe with
Kingsley's Hemocrates, a repressed academic who tries to fend off the
Princess' charms. Kingsley likened his scenes with Sorvino to a
tennis match at Wimbledon. "The crowd holds their breath when you get
two really good tennis players against each other, but at the same
time, playing with each other in the same game. We can only hit the
ball back as well as it comes at us."</TE>
<TE>   Sorvino was living in Paris two years ago with her boyfriend,
actor Olivier Martinez, when she first talked to "Triumph"
writer-director Clare Peploe about the role. Peploe recalls Sorvino's
impromptu audition. "We went to my apartment, which Roberto Benigni
had lent me, and Mira just read me a bit of Phocion seducing Leontine
in this flawless British accent, and I felt like Leontine. I was
completely seduced."</TE>
<TE>   Once Sorvino clinched the deal after meeting "Triumph" producer
Bernardo Bertolucci, the Harvard-educated actress did extensive
homework. She read Pierre Marivaux's original 1732 play, in French.
She studied 18th century portraits at the Louvre so she could mimic
the artificial poses as a "tip of the hat" to the era's preening
sensibility. She also borrowed some moves from contemporary figures.
"I pulled from a lot of crazy pop culture icons to play the guy. I
watched the Albert Finney movie 'Tom Jones,' and Capt. Kirk is in
there a little bit to get that larger-than-life, macho, bravura
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like 'Twelfth Night,' or any of those plays where you have
women masquerading as men. You want the audience to be laughing:
'Well, she doesn't get it quite right, because she's trying a little
bit too hard.'"</TE>
<TE>   Before filming "Triumph," Sorvino made "The Grey Zone," a
fact-based Holocaust drama slated for an October release. She plays a
concentration camp captive tortured for smuggling gun powder to a
group of Jewish prisoners planning to blow up the crematoriums at
Auschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   When casting "The Grey Zone," writer-director Tim Blake Nelson
found Sorvino's performance as a downtrodden Bronx housewife in Spike
Lee's 1999 urban drama "Summer of Sam" particularly intriguing. But
would she buy into his vision of a deliberately flat,
documentary-like film? And would she be easy to work with?</TE>
<TE>   "I encountered none of that difficult attitude others had told me
about," Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   Sorvino has confronted those "difficult" rumors more than once.
"When I won the Oscar, my life became a total whirlwind and I got
rocketed into doing one film after another very quickly, and no one
really tells you how to do it, what the rules are, and how to be the
consummate professional.</TE>
<TE>   "You sort of have to learn as you go. Now I know what needs to
happen on a movie set and how the actor has to be a team player,
which I don't think I really understood before."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson says Sorvino delivered precisely the muted performance the
picture required, without "a moment of movie-star antics.... Hers is
a lean, entirely unsentimental performance and it takes a lot of guts
for an actor to resist the impulse to embellish."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of "Aphrodite" and "Romy and Michele," Sorvino could
have capitalized on her platinum persona by picking more projects in
the same vein. That was not an option, she says."I had done 'Mighty
Aphrodite' and [the TV movie] 'Norma Jean &amp; Marilyn,' and then I did
'Romy and Michele' and that's sort of three dumb blonds in a
row--well, Marilyn Monroe was not a dumb blond but that's how she was
perceived--so after that, I did get a lot of offers for dumb blonds,
but I wouldn't do them. As Robert Redford said to me when I did 'Quiz
Show'"--Sorvino slips into a mock stentorian voice--"he said, 'Beware
the sex roles, Mira; they come to a dead end at 35.' And I think that
was good advice."</TE>
<TE>   While dating Quentin Tarantino, a fan of horror and action genres,
Sorvino followed "Romy and Michele" with "Mimic," in which she played
a scientist fighting mutated insects. The sci-fi thriller was praised
for Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's stylish visuals but failed
to connect at the box office. Sorvino has no regrets."Guillermo is
really brilliant and funny so I just said, 'I'm going to try this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Next came "The Replacement Killers," a martial arts feature
directed by Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day"). The appeal for Sorvino?
"Rather than being a sad character, I wanted to run around and kick
and jump and do stunts. It was fun. That was where I was then. I'm
not really there anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to make "Free Money" "had nothing to do with any kind
of judgment call, any kind of career planning," Sorvino says. "It was
like, 'Marlon Brando? Sign me up.'"</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on her hits and misses, Sorvino, the daughter of actor
Paul Sorvino, says, "I think in the past maybe some of my choices
were more like 'OK, well this seems fun, let's do it.' But you have
to remember, I was just starting out and I was more innocent about
the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Sorvino moved to Los Angeles last year from New York in part
because she simply could not find a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment
with southern exposure at a reasonable price. While visiting Los
Angeles with her mother, Sorvino spotted a house in Malibu and
decided on the spur of the moment to move west. "To think that I was
dying for a tiny square foot where I could put a tree, and now I have
land and trees and birds and lizards."</TE>
<TE>   There were also show-biz considerations. "In moving here," she
says, "I would be committing myself 100% to my career, which I've
never really done before."</TE>
<TE>   Sorvino continues to alternate between studio projects, like
Warner Bros.' Civil War drama "Gods and Generals," opening in
September, and smaller films, including "Between Strangers," an
ensemble drama co-starring Sophia Loren, and Sundance entry
"Wisegirls," both slated for release later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I would enjoy doing a bigger movie right now because I think,
just in terms of the sequence of things, that would be nice," she
says. "But if somebody sent me some brilliant script about the
fascinating women living in some fantastic age, I'd have to think
twice."</TE>
<TE>   In short, Sorvino, the master seductress in "Triumph of Love," is
herself subject to the seductions of a great script, regardless of
commercial potential. "It's just a question of what I fall in love
with."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to use some kind of instinct meter about it," she adds.
"I think I'm getting closer to my instincts now. I don't think there
needs to be a plan. I think there needs to be love. I think you need
to love what you're doing and then the rest is anybody's guess."</TE>

<DH>A too squeaky-clean 'Warning: Parental Advisory' recalls
'80s debate about pop lyrics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some things would be hilarious, if they weren't true. Take the whole
'80s escapades surrounding the establishment of the Parents Music
Resource Center by Tipper Gore, Susan Baker and several other
"Washington wives" concerned about the content of pop music being
sold to children.</LD>
<LD>   It was surreal: Gore on TV discussing the masturbation imagery of
Prince's "Darling Nikki"; Bob Dole castigating Cannibal Corpse as if
the little-known horror-metal band was a threat to national security;
various other prim and proper types combing through W.A.S.P., Twisted
Sister and Judas Priest albums in search of Satanism and
sadomasochism; the unlikely triumvirate of Dee Snider, Frank Zappa
and John Denver lecturing a Senate committee about free speech and
family values while music executives hid behind the 1st Amendment at
any suggestion that perhaps some material just isn't suitable for
kids.</LD>
<LD>   So why, in turning the events into a TV docudrama (er,
docu-farce), thread the conflict around fictional characters and a
lightweight back story closer to Ozzie Nelson than Ozzy Osbourne?
That's exactly what the people behind the VH1 movie "Warning:
Parental Advisory" have done, with Jason Priestley as a young, naive
music-industry lobbyist caught between his ambitions and his ideals.</LD>
<TE>   The tone is "The West Wing" meets "That '80s Show," though with
none of the intellectual aim or sizzling banter of the former or the
what-we-know-now humor of the latter. Save for a few Echo &amp; the
Bunnymen references and the fact that the music is played from vinyl
LPs, there's little sense of cultural context. Everything seems
watered-down and predictable, right down to the excessive lingering
on uptight conservatives having to speak naughty words and the pale
romantic tension between Priestley's Charlie Burner and a pragmatic,
conservative colleague (Deborah Yates).</TE>
<TE>   Burner is a well-meaning innocent where the events call for a
whip-smart crusader a la Rob Lowe's Sam on "The West Wing." Gore
(Mariel Hemingway) is portrayed as a similarly well-meaning though
misguided innocent. Most of the rest of the characters (the other
PMRC women, the senators, a couple of sub-"High Fidelity" record
store clerks) are basic caricatures.</TE>
<TE>   The only real dynamic comes from the Terrible Trio of rock stars,
and not much there. Griffin Dunne plays the late Zappa too benign and
lacking the sarcastic snarl for which he was known. Tim Guinee is all
distracted golly-gee as space-program-obsessed Denver. Dee Snider, as
himself, brings amped-up energy, but the script (by Jay Martel),
direction (Steven Haft, who did HBO's "Pirates of Silicon Valley")
and acting all work too hard to illustrate how the 1985 establishment
was frightened by the cartoonish Snider and Twisted Sister. (Perhaps
the best telling of this story, though, would have been through
Snider's eyes, rather than the fictional lobbyist's.)</TE>
<TE>   But even the drama of the Senate hearings is played light, with
the rock stars' knockout punch coming too cleanly to have any
dramatic weight, which makes the eventual compromise agreement to put
warning labels on potentially offensive recordings even more
anti-climactic than it was in real life. The label for this? Warning:
Dumbed-down television.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Warning: Parental Advisory" can be seen Sunday at 9 p.m. on VH1.
The network has rated it TV-14-L (may be inappropriate for children
under the age of 14, with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>A Race to Reverse a Subversion of Justice</HD>
<DH>Television: 'Whitewash: The Clarence Brandley Story,'
Sunday on Showtime, re-creates one man's judicial nightmare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I am just like a typical American," former death row inmate Clarence
Brandley, 51, says matter-of-factly, shortly before a Directors Guild
of America screening of the movie based on his life. "If an issue
didn't affect me, I didn't worry about it. But once I got into the
situation I was in, then my eyes became more open to what was really
going on and how the system actually works."</LD>
<LD>   The "system" that opened Brandley's eyes taught him that justice
can be not merely blind, but also dangerously dysfunctional--his
harrowing 10-year descent into the depths of American criminal
justice is laid bare in "Whitewash: The Clarence Brandley Story,"
premiering Sunday on Showtime.</LD>
<LD>   Airing less than a week after a bipartisan Illinois judicial
commission recommended comprehensive changes in the way capital
punishment is administered in that state, "Whitewash" investigates
Brandley's near-fatal encounter with the judicial system in his home
state of Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The troubles faced by Brandley, who is African American, began in
1980 when he was a high school maintenance supervisor overseeing an
all-white team of janitors in his hometown of Conroe, Texas. That
August, a white 16-year-old girl was found raped and strangled on
school grounds, and he was promptly taken into custody. The arresting
detective used a racial epitaph to tell Brandley that because he was
African American, he was "elected."</TE>
<TE>   From that point on, his ordeal reads like a Kafka nightmare. The
trial judge and prosecutor rehearsed their objections and rulings.
Evidence was destroyed. The presiding judge complied with the request
of a female court clerk and set Brandley's execution date on her
birthday. The federal judge who later reviewed the case wrote, "In
the 30 years this court has presided over matters in the judicial
system, no case has presented a more shocking scenario of the effects
of racial prejudice, perjured testimony, witness intimidation, an
investigation the outcome of which was predetermined, and public
officials who, for whatever motives, lost sight of what is right and
just."</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Tony Bill from a screenplay by Abby Mann, "Whitewash"
tells its story at a deliberate pace with few emotional adornments.
About the film's spare style, Bill said, "I felt that the story was
extremely compelling. I didn't want to embellish it with any
flashiness beyond the cold, hard facts. A great deal of the dialogue
is taken directly from the court records. I felt that the style of
the film should reflect the absolute truth to which we were trying to
adhere."</TE>
<TE>   Mann, who won an Oscar for "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961) and an
Emmy for "Indictment: The McMartin Trial" (1995), has made a career
of projects that explore complex issues of social, racial and legal
injustice, and Brandley's case had elements of all three. In 1987,
Mann was contacted by crusading death-penalty foe Jim McCloskey, a
former preacher whose work on behalf of Brandley and other
controversial death-row defendants has been profiled on "60 Minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The case was already the focus of British journalist Nick Davies'
book "White Lies: Rape, Murder and Justice Texas Style" when
McCloskey contacted Mann, who arrived just five days before Brandley
was to be executed. According to Mann, McCloskey told him, "This is
one of the most extraordinary cases because there isn't a scintilla
of evidence against this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Brandley's plight attracted a panoply of authentic American
characters. One of the most compelling was a Houston political
activist and preacher with the unlikely name of Jew Don Boney Jr.
Joining Brandley, Mann and their wives for a pre-screening interview
in the lobby of a Westwood hotel, Boney (who is played by "Oz's"
Eamonn Walker) said he waged a 10-year campaign to free Brandley from
death row.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to understand that there were over 200
demonstrations, actions and civil disobedience to get Clarence
Brandley a new trial so that new evidence and good, excellent
lawyering could drive the truth home and ultimately exonerate him,"
Boney said in the stentorian tones of a Southern Baptist preacher.
"Clarence's conviction was not a mistake. It wasn't an accident....
He was the victim of a district attorney, a number of judges and law
enforcement actually manufacturing evidence to railroad somebody that
they knew they didn't have the evidence to convict."</TE>
<TE>   Gil Bellows, of "Ally McBeal" and "The Agency," plays Mike De
Guerin, the unflappable defense attorney who manages to win
Brandley's freedom, and Courtney B. Vance, who co-stars in "Law &amp;
Order: Criminal Intent," portrays Brandley.</TE>
<TE>   "The piece is the process of his growing faith," Vance said. "I
knew that that's the only way it could be played. And that's the only
way that that man could stay alive--anybody on death row. If you
don't have faith, you turn into an animal. He didn't turn into an
animal, so I knew he had faith."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if his experience has made him bitter, Brandley first
spoke of the faith and people that sustained him, then added quietly,
"Sure, I'm bitter. I'm a human being like anybody else. But I don't
let my bitterness get me in a position where I'm going to let it
destroy me. Because then I would be locked up for something I did
do."</TE>

<LD>"Deja vu all over again," boomed malaprop-ing talk show host Sean
Hannity on the Fox News Channel during a Thursday evening of media
ranting and hyperventilating after has-been actor Robert Blake had
been taken into custody by Los Angeles police in connection with last
year's murder of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, all over again, for hadn't the public walked this plank
before when O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife,
Nicole, and Ron Goldman, en route to landing in a vast, turbulent sea
of media frenzy?</LD>
<LD>   Just when you think these 24-hour-news fruitcakes can't possibly
get worse, more indulgent or more absurd in covering breaking,
high-profile crime stories to the exclusion of events more
meaningful, something like Thursday night explodes onto the screen.</LD>
<TE>   At an LAPD press conference touching on the cases against Blake
and his handyman/bodyguard Earle Caldwell, CNN reporter Frank Buckley
mentioned the possibility of authorities being faulted for a "rush to
judgment." They were rushing to judgment?</TE>
<TE>   Before Blake even had been booked at Parker Center, a familiar
assembly line of spewing heads on CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC
was rolling forward irrevocably, arguing from every conceivable angle
the legal case against him they initially knew hardly anything about.
Only CNN's Charles Feldman--a first-rate journalist and seasoned
crime specialist who had been on the Blake story since its inception
a year ago--provided measured, fresh reporting about Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this story won't be fascinating on a titillating level
and surely worth covering to some extent. But unfortunately, it will
likely be covered to a colossal extent, destined to assume a swollen
life of its own that the media will then use to justify their
over-coverage that first planted the seed. In fact, this pregnant
belly already began growing Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Blake was still handcuffed in the back seat of an unmarked
white police car fighting rush-hour traffic on the 101 Freeway, these
premature questions, leading to wild speculation, were being asked on
TV:</TE>
<TE>   * What will be the defense strategy of his lawyer, Harland W.
Braun?</TE>
<TE>   * Would Braun ask for a change of venue?</TE>
<TE>   * What about jury selection?</TE>
<TE>   * Would Blake's trial be televised?</TE>
<TE>   * If cameras are banned from this courtroom, is an appeal by the
media possible?</TE>
<TE>   * Will Blake take the stand in his own defense? "I'm sure we'll
chew about that," said CNN legal guru Cynthia Alksne. Why not? They
chew about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just wonderful that, before he's even been charged, we can
talk about the prosecution and the defense," groused MSNBC legal
analyst Dan Abrams, his sarcasm indicating he'd had enough of this
meaningless swill. At last, a sane voice cautioning restraint. Then
Abrams went on and speculated about the prosecution and the defense,
as he did again Friday morning on NBC's "Today" program.</TE>
<TE>   How loopy was much of the coverage?</TE>
<TE>   So loopy that Fox News Channel got even Geraldo Rivera on the
horn. "What's likely to have happened recently to allow this arrest
to happen now?" Hannity's Fox co-host, Alan Colmes, wanted to know.
It would have been a reasonable question had Rivera been in Los
Angeles. Or in the U.S. Or in the hemisphere. But he wasn't. He was
speaking by satellite from Beirut, where, as a war correspondent
covering the Middle East conflict, he was as distant from the L.A.
crime beat as Blake was from the streetwise cop he played on ABC's
"Baretta" in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But what, Rivera shrink? "Any number of a myriad of
possibilities," he responded to Colmes. "I can only assume ... " In
fact, he was not the only one on this 24-hour-news landscape making
assumptions based on scant data.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, CNN's Aaron Brown spent much of the evening playing the
role of Anchorman Buckling Under Self-Doubt while publicly beating
himself up for doing what he was doing, then going ahead and doing it
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "How are the media gonna cover this?" he wondered, throwing open
the door to this glass house. Didn't he get it? He and CNN are the
media. Yet his fixation on self-examination throughout the evening
made it appear he was having some kind of out-of-body experience.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the camera, Brown warned about overplaying the Blake
story that he and CNN were overplaying by blowing off much of the
day's other news. "The country's at war, on your side of the camera
and on mine," he reminded us. "We ought to keep that in mind." It
sounded like he was admonishing viewers for watching the
over-coverage that he immediately extended by weighing the potential
impact of Blake's tough-guy image. "Can you inoculate him [so a jury
can distinguish] between what he is and what he has played?" he asked
attorney Alksne.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger question: Who would give these guys a slow-down
inoculation?</TE>
<TE>   The network morning shows, too, were all over this sucker Friday.
"Slim and none," Court TV anchor Catherine Crier said on CNN Friday
about the chances of Blake's account of how his wife died being
truthful. The rush to inflate is bound to accelerate, too, for coming
in prime time Monday is the long-ago-taped ABC special "Contact:
Talking to the Dead," in which medium George Anderson purports to
chat with Bakley from beyond, as her mother and sister listen in. And
darn, she doesn't say who pulled the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   What were the chances of this story quieting down?</TE>
<TE>   You'd have to say slim and none. How big was it Thursday night? So
big that KNBC dispatched its Big Dippers into the night for live
stand-ups on the street. It had Colleen Williams co-anchoring the 11
p.m. news in front of the Studio City restaurant outside of which
Bakley was fatally shot in her car, and Paul Moyer co-anchoring
outside the main entrance of the swanky Hidden Hills community where
Blake had been taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested at his own house, which he bought for $1.3 million, CNN
reporter Thelma Gutierrez had said when posted there hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At his wife's house, reported Hannity.</TE>
<TE>   At his sister's house, several stations reported.</TE>
<TE>   At his daughter's house, anchor Harold Greene correctly reported
on KCBS-TV, after his station had earlier gotten it wrong.</TE>
<TE>   When Blake had been collected from the sprawling ranch home, it
was crucial for Los Angeles news choppers to provide live overhead
coverage of the police car as it edged toward downtown. Why? You
could never tell, Blake might try to escape.</TE>
<TE>   After scooping everyone with a live phone interview with Blake's
lawyer Braun, as he was in his own car traveling toward Parker
Center, CNN's Larry King homed in on the freeway traffic holding up
the police vehicle carrying Blake.</TE>
<TE>   King asked Feldman why there was no siren. In fact, the siren was
TV.</TE>

<LD>As a fervent "SpongeBob SquarePants" devotee since the show's debut,
I was both heartbroken and relieved to see that series creator
Stephen Hillenburg has opted not to renew his contract with
Nickelodeon ("'SpongeBob' Creator Feels Wrung Out," by Bettijane
Levine, April 13). I respect his intent to avoid "watering down" the
franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Then I read a little further. Nickelodeon can continue to produce
new episodes, regardless of Hillenburg's involvement or approval. But
he doesn't think they would do that: "I think they would want to
maintain the original ... quality."</LD>
<LD>   Wow. It's easy to see where "SpongeBob" gets that trademark
innocence and naivete.</LD>

<LD>Based on the strong review from your paper, my husband and I went to
see "Frailty" ("A Powerful Depiction of Human 'Frailty,'" by Kenneth
Turan, April 12). Let me use dialogue here consistent with the
creativity shown in the script: You've got to be kidding!</LD>
<LD>   Everyone walking out of the film was shaking their heads and
laughing. The man next to us said, "I can't believe I sat through the
whole thing." It is, without a doubt, the most misrepresented and
worst movie I have ever paid to view.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It amazes me how "enlightened" minds clap shut and remain clamped
tight regarding the power of faith in God.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Stuart's review of "The Other Side of Heaven" ("On a Spiritual
Mission in the South Pacific," April 12) was condescending at best,
and pointedly insulting at worst. Dismissively detailing no more than
the bare bones of the plot, Stuart sweepingly deemed the film full of
"Mormon propaganda," "thrillingly awful moments," "white Christian
chauvinism" and "a clueless air of self-congratulation." Whew! Could
it really be that bad? I decided see for myself.</TE>
<TE>   Funny. What I saw was a story of young John Groberg, who learned
to love a people very different than himself. He learned their
language, ate their food, worked beside them, mourned their losses,
lived through their trials. He gained respect for the rival minister
and learned wisdom from those with more life experience than he. His
tools were humility, determination and an ability to laugh at
himself. Stuart didn't take time to review the directing, acting,
cinematography, etc. What he did review, in supercilious tones, was
the premise that a spiritual disciple could actually experience a
profound odyssey such as Groberg did. People do, you know. Even
young, white Christian males.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I got a real kick out of the Eastside versus Westside piece in
Calendar Weekend ("The Ultimate Turf War," by Leslee Komaiko and
Christopher Noxon, April 18). As the ultimate Eastsider, I love this
argument but, sadly, the strongest points in our favor weren't
included.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Pasadena there are cultural institutions of international
(not local) importance: the Huntington, the Norton Simon and the
Pacific Asia Museum. These treasures pack a powerful punch and make
Westsiders run with their tails between their legs.</LD>
<LD>   Add to that a culturally diverse mix of people, great shopping in
Old Town and the most beautiful domestic architecture in L.A.,
surrounded by glorious trees (remember those?), and you have the
winner, hands down.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading the Eastside-Westside sound off, I'd just like to
say: none of the above, thank you. While I technically live on the
Eastside, anywhere away from these two bad-tempered complainers is
where I'd like to live. I know this piece was supposed to be funny,
but it's just this kind of negative, me-first/I'm better/hipper
attitude that's turning our streets and public spaces into
confrontational danger zones.</TE>

<TE>   I absolutely loved "The Ultimate Turf War." It was sometimes
provocative, quite amusing and a great road map of the many
fascinating things to do and see on both the Eastside and Westside. I
honestly think that the match between the two sides was a draw.</TE>
<TE>   But as for the SUV traffic jams near the ocean: Betcha a big
percentage of the behemoths emanate from the Eastside.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since when did the "Eastside" begin at La Brea Avenue? Your
dueling "Westsider" and "Eastsider" hardly acknowledge the real
Eastside--the one east of downtown. By denying the existence of this
less fashionable Eastside, your lighthearted feature becomes a
depressing example of the very real parochialism that does us no
good.</TE>

<LD>Taylor Hudson has mounted his high horse to call those of us who were
appalled by Ron Howard's decision not to cast a Latina actress to
portray the Salvadoran Alicia Nash in "A Beautiful Mind" "hypocrites"
(Letters, April 13).</LD>
<LD>   Hudson then goes on to "prove" his point by asking where was the
"similar outrage" when the English Ben Kingsley played Gandhi; the
Aussie Russell Crowe played Virginian John Nash; the Texan Renee
Zellweger played (the fictional) Bridget Jones.</LD>
<LD>   Um, Mr. Hudson? Those would be just super points but for one
thing: Those actors all portrayed the people they played with the
appropriate accents to indicate where they were from. Jennifer
Connelly's portrayal did not for one moment begin to let us in on the
fact that Mrs. Nash is Salvadoran. And we want to know why.</LD>

<TE>   'SpongeBob's' Innocence</TE>
<TE>   As a fervent "SpongeBob SquarePants" devotee since the show's
debut, I was both heartbroken and relieved to see that series creator
Stephen Hillenburg has opted not to renew his contract with
Nickelodeon ("'SpongeBob' Creator Feels Wrung Out," by Bettijane
Levine, April 13). I respect his intent to avoid "watering down" the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Then I read a little further. Nickelodeon can continue to produce
new episodes, regardless of Hillenburg's involvement or approval. But
he doesn't think they would do that: "I think they would want to
maintain the original ... quality."</TE>
<TE>   Wow. It's easy to see where "SpongeBob" gets that trademark
innocence and naivete.</TE>

<LD>I wonder what comedy-writing school Vic Cabrera attended ("'Lopez'
Family Dynamics Not True to Life," April 15). Or perhaps his put-down
of "The George Lopez Show" was slanted not by what he calls poor
comedy writing but more likely because he was relegated by his wife
to watching the new comedy on his small TV set in the kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   Out here in viewerland, my friends, family and neighbors are quite
delighted with the series. We think it is funny, refreshing and a
welcome change from the reruns of a dozen sitcoms we're faced with
each evening. We laugh a lot.</LD>
<LD>   VIRGINIA MIESSNER</LD>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The characters on "The George Lopez Show" are not honest to
Cabrera because, maybe, he doesn't know anyone like that. I sure do.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a 30-years-young Latino father with an 11-year-old daughter
whom I want to know everything about. The channels of communication
are always open on my side. My daughter might choose not to tell me
some things, but I am there to listen to anything she has to share.
Especially if sharing with me is going to make her feel better. My
father was definitely not like that, but we live in a different time
now. "Where's her mother?" is not the solution.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera generalizes too much and assumes that all Latino families
are like his. Wrong. There are real people like everyone on that
show.</TE>
<TE>   RAFAEL CARDENAS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some may see "Resurrection Boulevard," "American Family" and "The
George Lopez Show" as groundbreaking, but it annoys me as a young
Latino to see stories revolve around East L.A., gangs, families
sitting down eating rice and beans, and everyone speaking with an
accent.</TE>
<TE>   Latino culture is diverse. We don't all come from East L.A., we
are not all in gangs, we eat things besides rice and beans and we all
don't speak with accents. It disturbs me that stereotypical roles
continue to be broadcast the same way they were when I was growing
up.</TE>
<TE>   DAVID G. VILLANUEVA</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latinos are as diverse as any other loosely defined ethnic group
on Earth. But whereas white people accept their diversity and
understand that the white characters they see on TV do not
necessarily represent them or their entire race, minorities often
labor under the assumption that if the minority characters they see
on TV aren't exactly like them, then something's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This was what sank "All American Girl" (ABC's noble attempt to
produce the first Asian American sitcom). Let us hope that Latino
activists don't make the mistake that Asian American activists did
when they drove that show off the air because of its "unrealistic"
portrayal of an Asian American family.</TE>
<TE>   If minorities really want to see more nonwhite characters on TV,
we must do as we ask white people to do, and "celebrate
diversity"--not just the diversity of our society as a whole, but
also the diversity that occurs within our own racial or ethnic
groups.</TE>

<LD>We at Premiere are grateful to Patrick Goldstein for pointing out
that Premiere pioneered the concept of a Power List ("Powers Behind
the Thrones," April 16), and we share his conviction that those with
"the commitment to make good movies" should be "exalted." Thus his
reiteration of our choices of George Clooney (No. 27), Joel and Ethan
Coen (No. 92), Danny DeVito (No. 69), Ang Lee (No. 59) and Working
Title (No. 51) is unsurprising. We'll be glad to share our Power
Listers with Patrick again next year.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding Susan Sarandon, Patrick Goldstein asked, "Who else can
say they worked with Billy Wilder and Natalie Portman?"</TE>
<TE>   At least two other people can say that: Austin Pendleton worked
with Wilder in "The Front Page" and appeared on Broadway with Portman
in "The Diary of Anne Frank," and Christopher Lee acted for Wilder in
"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" and can be seen with Portman in
the upcoming "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." I am a

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the world watches a real-life drama about the love invested in
a homeland and the blood shed over it, the Open Fist Theatre Company
is wrestling with those themes in a staging of "Flight," by Russian
writer Mikhail Bulgakov.</LD>
<LD>   Written in the mid- to late 1920s and banned before it could be
presented in the fledgling Soviet Union, the play revisits the final
days of the Russian Revolution and civil war, as the opposing armies
murder and lay waste to the very things they profess to hold dear.</LD>
<LD>   In a version freely adapted by Steven Haworth and staged by
Charles Otte, the story unfolds as a fevered dream. The actors are
mirrored in glass panels, and the world around them keeps
dissolving--effects achieved by the evanescent interplay of Bill
Eigenbrodt and Meghan Rogers' set and Robert Conner's projections.</LD>
<TE>   Yet while the presentation is haunting and beautiful, it is also
messy and baffling. Abrupt stylistic shifts and elliptical meanings
make the proceedings difficult to follow, and not all 16 performers
are equal to the complex tasks set out for them.</TE>
<TE>   In "Flight," Bulgakov--whose later masterwork would be the novel
"The Master and Margarita"--follows the last remnants of
pre-revolutionary Russia as they are pushed out of their homeland by
the Red Army's advance.</TE>
<TE>   Key characters include Maj. Gen. Grigory Charnota (Patrick Tuttle)
and Gen. Roman Kludhov (Will Kepper), White Army commanders who are
bitterly frustrated by their inability to stem the Red tide, and
Sergei Golubkov (Joe Zanetti) and Serafima Korzukhina (Arizona
Brooks), civilians seeking what little protection the defeated army
can still provide.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Red and White armies commit atrocities as they pass
across the land, murdering those they suspect of sympathizing with
the other side. Haunted by guilt for the zeal with which he ordered
his countrymen hung, Gen. Kludhov will later realize, "It was all for
nothing. It was all pointless."</TE>

<LD>   'The Osbournes': Biggest MTV Hit</LD>
<LD>   "The Osbournes," the reality show about rocker Ozzy Osbourne and
his colorful family life, is officially the biggest hit series in
MTV's 21-year history. And, according to Nielsen Media Research, the
series has pushed aside professional wrestling as cable's
most-watched show.</LD>
<TE>   More than 6.2 million people watched last Tuesday's episode, up
from 6 million the week before--surpassing the number who tuned in to
MTV's "Beavis &amp; Butt-head" and "Real World."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to take advantage of the hit, MTV is playing episodes 15
times a week. Three more original episodes are due to air before the
end of the season, and the network may try to use existing footage to
create up to three additional new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are underway with the family about filming another
season's worth of shows. The Osbournes are reportedly concerned about
an influx of tourists at their California home and may ask that some
of the filming take place at their second home in England.</TE>

<TE>   Swastika Poster Nixed for Costa-Gavras Film</TE>
<TE>   Mikado Film, the distributor of Costa-Gavras' "Amen," is pulling
down posters for the political drama in Italy--heading off a move by
right-wing politicians to ban them.</TE>
<TE>   The posters, designed by Oliviero Toscani, feature a red swastika
designed to resemble a Latin cross. The film tells the story of Pope
Pius XII's purported silence during World War II in the face of Nazi
war crimes against Jews--a theme likely to incur the wrath of the
Vatican. The film opened Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I am surprised [at Mikado's move] because the distributor
radically changed the promotion plan for the film without warning
us," Costa-Gavras told the Hollywood Reporter. "It seems he is
embarrassed or wants to apologize for its content."</TE>
<TE>   Mikado chalked up its decision to international strife. "Given the
current tensions in the Middle East, we thought the posters could
lend themselves to misunderstandings," said the company's co-chief,
Roberto Cicutto.</TE>
<TE>   No matter, Costa-Gavras maintained. Retreating from the statement
made by the poster sets a bad precedent, he said. "This is a movie
about history, which ... as always, repeats itself. Silence is never
a solution."</TE>

<TE>   Former Maid Slaps Brando With Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Maria Cristina Ruiz, reported to be a former maid of Marlon
Brando, filed a lawsuit against the actor in Los Angeles Superior
Court, charging him with breach of contract. She claimed that the
famous actor fathered three children--now aged 8, 10 and 13--with her
during a nearly 14-year relationship that ended last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, 43, seeks $100 million in damages as well as monthly
payments for support and maintenance. Her lawsuit maintains that they
lived together and that Brando, 78, supported her until December,
after which he only paid child support. He promised that his property
would be divided between her and the children if the relationship
ended, Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   No one from Brando's camp, contacted by the Associated Press,
chose to comment.</TE>

<TE>   Settlement Reached in Tammy Wynette Case</TE>
<TE>   A settlement has been reached in the case in which Tammy Wynette's
four daughters charged that Dr. Wallis Marsh contributed to the death
of the country music star. Details were not released. The matter had
been scheduled to go to trial May 7.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for her hit "Stand by Your Man," Wynette died in 1998
of heart failure caused by chronic blood clots. She suffered for
years with painful stomach ailments and was treated for addiction to
painkillers. Marsh, a Pittsburgh physician, prescribed the drug
Versed to the singer.</TE>
<TE>   The daughters--Tina Jones, Jackie Daly, Georgette Smith and Gwen
Nicholas--were seeking $50 million, claiming that he mismanaged her
case.</TE>

<HD>Rebellious Tone of 'fresh tracks/02' Survives Fuses and
Seating</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The George J. Doizaki Gallery at the Japanese American Cultural &amp;
Community Center resembled a trendy performance club Thursday, as the
center's "fresh tracks/02" series opened a three-night run.</LD>
<LD>   Although food and drink weren't sold, the audience and the
performers were young, the material had a rebellious streak and the
sight lines were terrible. Most of the folding chairs were in rows on
the flat floor, with three raised rows near the back, so it was
difficult to see the dancers or actors whenever they approached a
prone position.</LD>
<LD>   Near the end, just as the hereandnow theater company was beginning
the depiction of a feverish sexual assault, a fuse blew out. The
stage lights and sound system broke down, the house lights came up,
thumbs twiddled. After the problem was fixed, the company resumed its
work with different material, probably a smart choice, although the
audience was left wondering what might have been.</LD>
<TE>   The evening began auspiciously with "S(hed)," a sensual video and
dance that focused on undressing, dressing and cross-dressing,
performed by the choreographer Marianne Kim and Peter Carpenter, with
videography by Viola X.</TE>
<TE>   Two spoken-word artists followed: Rotha Dom, a soft-spoken
commentator who discussed a daughter disdainful of her Cambodian
American mother, and Leah Taguba, a hip-hop-influenced Filipina
American with a more aggressive approach.</TE>
<TE>   The hereandnow company presented four sketches in addition to the
one that was interrupted. The lighter-toned pieces--one about pidgin
and the other about a trio of miked sound-effects artists at the
mall--were more successful.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's third bill of fare will feature a different round of
dance, spoken word and hip-hop.</TE>

<LD>The "disease of the week" genre has been a TV staple for decades, to
the point where viewers who have been burned once too often have
become immune to even the slickest of promotional campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   But don't let the afflictions of the past lead you to cast a
jaundiced eye toward Sunday's little gem of a movie "Two Against
Time" (CBS, 9 p.m.). Director David Anspaugh and co-stars Marlo
Thomas and Ellen Muth turn what might have been a routine emotional
button-pusher into an achingly beautiful story of a mother and
daughter's struggle for survival.</LD>
<LD>   Anspaugh has distinguished himself previously in a pair of
sports-related theatrical releases, "Hoosiers" (1983) and "Rudy"
(1993), and he uses the against-all-odds themes learned there to
wrenching effect in this film, which, like the other two, is based on
a true story. Thomas is exceptional as Julie Portman, a divorced mom
whose strained relationship with her rebellious daughter, Emma
(Muth), seems to be the biggest problem in her life. Not for long,
and not by a long shot.</LD>
<TE>   What first appears to be just a sore elbow for Emma is diagnosed
as a cancer that attacks muscle tissue. The grueling treatment
regimen that follows puts the roles of mother and daughter in a new
light, helping bring them together even as the disease threatens to
tear them apart--forever.</TE>
<TE>   But there's another shoe that's about to drop, and it comes with a
thud that shakes both mother and daughter to their core. Julie is
diagnosed with breast cancer, and her plight suddenly puts an ominous
new spin on the pair's caregiver-patient arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Anspaugh shows uncommon craft in building several
pivotal scenes that lend strength and nuance to the movie, and David
Shire's music is a marvel of restrained elegance.</TE>
<TE>   And in the end, "Two Against Time" shows just how precious that
time can be.</TE>

<HD>Incubus Rises Above Ear-Candy Level</HD>
<DH>Popular band from Calabasas makes more than just noise,
offering sturdy grooves, pleasing melodies at Forum show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All the parents who dropped off their kids at the Incubus concert
Thursday at the Forum, and all those middle-aged chaperons with
earplugs conspicuously shutting out the band's noise-quake, had
nothing to fear.</LD>
<LD>   This 20-something quintet from Calabasas may bring the noise, but
a quick sift through the clamor reveals lyrics whose sentiments
square with those youth-directed public service announcements the TV
networks run during sporting events. Incubus is a band of moralists
whose music is buffed out with the brawn of a WWF wrestler.</LD>
<LD>   A classic case of local boys made good, Incubus released a
self-made album independently in 1995, was signed to Epic records
shortly thereafter. It then rode the metal-sentimentalist rock fad
all the way to multi-platinum status and shows such as this, which
was a near sell-out.</LD>
<TE>   But it would be doing Incubus an injustice to place it on the same
continuum as Staind and Nickelback, two bands that seem to regard
acoustic guitars as little more than meal tickets toward radio
immortality.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Incubus does a fine job of aiming straight for its target
audience. Its lineup featured turntablist Chris Kilmore, who provided
the requisite hip-hop window dressing, and dexterous bassist Dirk
Lance, who, along with drummer Jose Pasillas, provided nimble funk
grooves to guitarist Mike Einziger's circular riffs. Einziger is the
band's linchpin, a technically slick player whose melodies wander
into pleasing, unexpected territory. He lifts Incubus out of the
neo-grunge gutter.</TE>
<TE>   Incubus' lyrical messages can be reduced to greeting card
aphorisms, but Einziger's wide-screen sonic constructions gave the
songs a heftier emotional resonance for those who sang along to every
word at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "Drive," the band's first big hit, is about letting fear take over
one's life. "Lately I'm beginning to find that I should be the one
behind the wheel," sang lead singer Brandon Boyd, no doubt stirring
the young hearts of every kid in the arena who has been grounded
without dinner. "Nice to Know You" and "Mexico" are songs about
romantic betrayal--one astringent and vituperative, the other a kind
of tender kiss-off, both big hits with this crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Incubus has located that special place where fear and
disillusionment wrapped in metal bluster send out the right homing
signals to both male and female listeners, and for that they have
been amply recompensed. But the band can't be written off as mere
marketeers. As songwriters, they don't dismiss structure, and if
their lyrics tended toward the banal on Thursday, they were able to
overcompensate with sturdy, nuanced grooves.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Andersen Partners Talking to Rival Firms</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The office might sell parts of its business to
KPMG and Deloitte &amp; Touche amid possibility the company will go out
of business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Partners in the Los Angeles office of accounting firm Arthur Andersen
are in negotiations to sell parts of their Southern California
business to rivals KPMG and Deloitte &amp; Touche, according to people
familiar with the talks.</LD>
<LD>   Until the Enron Corp. debacle, which has cost Andersen hundreds of
clients and sparked massive layoffs, the firm's Southern California
operations employed about 1,500 staff members and counted important
businesses such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., Edison International
and the Dodgers as clients.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen has offices in Los Angeles, Woodland Hills and Irvine.</LD>
<TE>   The talks with rivals are part of a nationwide trend in which
individual Andersen practices are seeking to cut deals with other
firms in anticipation of the company going out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of discussions going on," one Andersen source
said. "Different offices are pursuing their own agreements. Partners
are looking at all the options for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   None of the firms involved in the discussions would comment,
although under various scenarios being considered, different parts of
the practice and its staff could go to either KPMG or Deloitte.</TE>
<TE>   And as with other deals involving Andersen, these talks still must
deal with how the acquiring firms could insulate themselves from the
billions of dollars of claims against Andersen arising from its work
for Enron, which is in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, Andersen rejected a bid by leveraged
buyout firm Fox Paine &amp; Co. to acquire its national tax practice.
Sources said Andersen decided instead to pursue a deal to sell about
half of the practice to Deloitte. The practice accounts for about 25%
of Andersen's $4.3 billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's outlook turned bleaker this week when it failed to
settle its criminal charge of obstruction of justice with the Justice
Department. The case will go to trial May 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day that goes by, they lose more clients, more partners,
more staff members and more revenue," said Randolph Beatty, dean of
USC's accounting school. "At a certain point, there won't be anything
left."</TE>
<TE>   Though negotiations have broken off in the criminal case and are
stalled in Andersen's efforts to settle the giant Enron investor
class-action lawsuit, talks continue between Andersen and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Yet it is unclear whether a final
deal would be inked in the absence of a parallel settlement with the
Justice Department, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen and the SEC have sketched out the broad contours of a
plan to settle civil charges stemming from the collapse of Enron. But
key issues, including the exact amount Andersen would pay in a fine,
have not been finalized, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC sought a penalty of as much as $500 million earlier this
year. But that amount has been scaled back significantly amid the
accounting firm's financial debilitation.</TE>

<HD>FCC Challenges Ruling on TV Ownership Cap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission challenged an appeals court
decision setting aside a limit on the television stations News Corp.,
Viacom Inc. and other media companies may own.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in
February told the FCC to rewrite a rule that limited companies to
reaching 35% of TV homes with their stations.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC asked the court to reconsider its decision. Consumer
advocates and smaller TV station groups support the cap, saying it
boosts diversity and competition. News Corp. and Viacom, each
reaching about 39% of TV homes, challenged the limit as obsolete amid
cable and Internet options.</LD>
<TE>   The court ruling "imposes a substantial and continuing burden on
the agency that threatens administrative paralysis," the FCC said in
its appeal filed with the court.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell has said the February decision
makes it hard for the agency to maintain other media ownership rules.</TE>
<TE>   The court said in the ruling that the FCC had to prove every two
years that each ownership restriction continued to be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. spokesman Andrew Butcher said the FCC's appeal won't
affect the company.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Ford Luxury Division Chief Stepping Down</HD>
<DH>Autos: Wolfgang Reitzle is replaced by Mazda President Mark
Fields. Lincoln brand moves out of the premier group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>As part of its sweeping restructuring plan, Ford Motor Co. said
Friday that the head of its luxury auto division was stepping down
and that it would move the California-based Lincoln brand out of its
Premier Automotive Group.</LD>
<LD>   Wolfgang Reitzle, a highflying auto executive recruited from BMW
in 1999, is leaving to become chief executive of Linde, a German
industrial firm. Reitzle will remain for an unspecified time as a
consultant to Ford on product, design and marketing issues.</LD>
<LD>   He will be succeeded by Mark Fields, president of Mazda Motor
Corp. Fields, 41, is considered a Ford whiz kid who was named head of
Mazda when he was 38.</LD>
<TE>   Reitzle steps down as Ford's luxury czar only three months after
the auto maker announced its wide-ranging recovery plan that included
having the PAG brands--Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover and Aston
Martin--grow aggressively and account for 35% of Ford's profit by
mid-decade.</TE>
<TE>   Reitzle's exit is "a disappointing development, given the
credibility he brought to the company's luxury effort," Merrill Lynch
auto industry analyst John Casesa said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Operating Officer Nick Scheele said Ford's luxury brands
still would deliver their planned profits. Lincoln and the Mercury
brand, which make up the Lincoln Mercury division, are being merged
into Ford's North American operations to gain manufacturing and
marketing efficiencies, Scheele said. Fields will direct PAG from
London.</TE>
<TE>   "Lincoln was a little bit of an orphan with the other products in
PAG and has more of a tie with the Ford brand," said David Cole,
director of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   There was never any consideration to moving the Irvine-based PAG
staff to London, Scheele said. "This is their biggest market, and
California is as good a place as any, if not better. It's a hugely
growing demographic area, it represents automotive buying habits, and
you see the competition close-up."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors had circulated for weeks in Detroit that Reitzle had a
falling-out with management.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolfgang has, and continues to have, strong feelings for Ford,"
Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr. said. "But Wolfgang wanted to
run his own show. He wanted to be his own CEO in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times late last year, Reitzle said
William Ford "was there at every interview" and was "fully
supportive" of Reitzle's plans for PAG.</TE>
<TE>   It was Reitzle's idea to leave the post and remain as a
consultant, Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   A European sophisticate, Reitzle said he admired the work done by
such wide-ranging retailers as Prada and Gap.</TE>
<TE>   "He must be a real unfathomable presence, a Renaissance man coming
in and talking about cars in terms people had never heard before,"
said David E. Davis, editorial director of Motor Trend.</TE>
<TE>   Fields presided over a turn of fortunes at Mazda, from losing
money to earning $9.7 million in the six months ended Sept. 30, the
first half of the last Japanese fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   But Mazda, which was the No. 4 Asian import brand in the U.S.
three years ago, has stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   It was passed by Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in 2000, and last year it
slipped from No. 5 to No. 6 as Hyundai Motor Co. passed it. It
declined 18% in the first quarter of this year to be the No. 8 Asian
import, passed by Kia Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus unit.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Booth, a Mazda senior advisor, will succeed Fields at Mazda.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares rose 49 cents to $16.36 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Gates to Testify for the First Time in 4-Year Microsoft
Antitrust Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Software giant's chairman will tell judge that the
proposed remedy sought by the non-settling states would harm
industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates will testify against the
antitrust sanctions sought by nine states still pursuing the landmark
case against the software giant.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the first time Gates testifies in the historic
four-year case.</LD>
<LD>   Gates gave a sworn deposition before the original trial, and
videotaped portions of it were played in the courtroom in 1998 and
1999, prompting U.S. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to describe him as
evasive and forgetful.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson's comments about Gates' testimony in interviews to
reporters contributed to his removal from the case.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, the world's richest man, "will speak to the potential harm
to consumers and the industry posed by the non-settling states'
remedy proposals" in his testimony before U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly, Microsoft said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   More specifically, Gates will tell the judge that the stricter
sanctions would hobble collaboration in the computer industry,
according to a company spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The nine states have refused to sign on to a settlement of the
case reached between Microsoft and the Justice Department in
November.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Microsoft named Gates along with Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer and 11 other company executives as possible witnesses
for the hearings on the states' demands.</TE>
<TE>   But until Friday, it was unclear when--or even whether --Gates
would appear in court.</TE>
<TE>   The case will enter its sixth week Monday. Gates is to testify on
that day after lawyers for the states finish questioning another
Microsoft executive, David Cole.</TE>
<TE>   The choice to put Gates on the stand could be a risky one for
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most damaging statements and e-mails during the
liability phase of the trial came from Gates, and he has a reputation
of being easily frustrated with people who are not technically savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know whether this is the lawyer's idea or the
client's idea," said Dana Hayter, a San Francisco antitrust attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Hayter said Gates' mission on the stand will be to "sound
reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   "If instead the impression is that he views [the remedies] as
either a personal attack or an attack on Microsoft, and he's
concerned more about why it hurts Microsoft than why it hurts the
consumer, then the mission won't be achieved," Hayter said.</TE>
<TE>   During opening arguments in the case five weeks ago, an attorney
for the states told Kollar-Kotelly that Gates was being similarly
evasive this time around.</TE>
<TE>   When asked at a pre-hearing interview whether the settlement would
allow Microsoft to use the same tactics that landed it in court,
Gates replied, "There's not enough data in this summary to allow me
to answer that."</TE>

<DH>Insurance: The approved increase by CalPERS distresses many
who became government workers for the benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than anything else, it was the generous health benefits that
attracted Liz Carvin to government work back in 1984. Even as a
janitor for the General Services Department in Sacramento, Carvin
felt like a rich woman when it came to her medical coverage.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent years, her health insurance contributions for
herself and her family have been creeping higher. Co-payments for
doctor's office visits doubled this year to $10. Carvin's share for
prescription drugs tripled in some cases; it now costs her about $60
a month for asthma and diabetes medicine. And it's going to get
worse.</LD>
<LD>   With CalPERS' approval this week of a 25% increase in health
premiums for next year, Carvin and many of the 1.2 million members of
the California Public Employees' Retirement System are facing
out-of-pocket premium increases of as much as 66%.</LD>
<TE>   Carvin, who takes home about $1,600 a month, is expecting her
contributions to jump from about $70 a month this year to more than
$100.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," Carvin said. "You might not make that much, but
the benefits, that's why we got in it," she said of government
employment. "But now we're just like everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   By most measures, CalPERS members, who include state and local
government workers and retirees, still are better off than most when
it comes to health insurance. For state employees in California, the
government next year will pick up 85% or more of the total premium
costs.</TE>
<TE>   On average, private employers nationally contributed 76% of
medical insurance premiums for individual coverage and 67% for
families of employees, according to a survey last year by Mercer
Human Resource Consulting. Mercer's report also suggests that CalPERS
members pay less for health insurance than most government workers in
other states.</TE>
<TE>   Blaine Bos, a principal at Mercer, said private and public
employers typically have not been shifting a greater percentage of
health premiums to workers in the last three years, largely because
of the competitive labor market.</TE>
<TE>   But with corporate profits still sluggish and signs that
health-care costs will continue to spiral, analysts say employers
could start to put more of the onus on workers, as CalPERS has.</TE>
<TE>   In approving the 25% average jump in HMO premiums next year,
CalPERS, the nation's second-largest buyer of health insurance,
warned that things could get worse the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Most California state government workers have not received a pay
raise in nearly two years, although their take-home pay rose by 2.5%
this year because of pension deferrals.</TE>
<TE>   By contract, state workers are slated to receive a 5% wage
increase next year. But for some, that will be wiped out by higher
medical costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to find a way to lower my standard of living,"
said Ralph Robles, who works for the Air Resources Board in
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strain, especially for the lower income and
chronically ill,'' said Steve Nakamura, president of Local 794 of the
California State Employees Assn. He said that more than a third of
the association's members covered by CalPERS' health plans earn less
than $3,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The strains already are apparent. A number of workers said they
had reduced visits to doctors this year, after co-payments rose for
office visits.</TE>
<TE>   Some CalPERS retirees, to avoid office co-pays, have been going to
hospital emergency rooms because there is no ER co-payment under
CalPERS' plans for retirees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's happening enough where it's a problem," said Kathleen
McKenna, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente, which is CalPERS'
biggest HMO with almost 400,000 enrollees.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser's premium for CalPERS is rising 23% next year, an increase
the HMO partly attributed to higher costs at its hospitals, including
state-required seismic retrofitting. Most of the burden falls on
state employees, whose rates will go up much more than those of
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Employees who want Kaiser coverage for themselves and their
families will contribute $86.95 a month, up from $52.44 this year.
Family coverage at CalPERS' other major HMO, Blue Shield, will cost
an employee $108 a month, compared with $69 this year.</TE>
<TE>   For Vickie Bordeaux, a single mother in Sacramento, that $39 would
buy a pair of shoes for her teenage son or a Sunday afternoon at the
movies with her family. Or pay the phone bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me mad. It's a big, old chunk out of my paycheck," said
the 37-year-old clerk with California Community Colleges in
Sacramento. Even when office co-pays were $5 last year, Bordeaux
said, she spaced out her visits for back spasm therapy to save money.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's already $10 to get into the door," she said. "That makes
me not go to the doctor."</TE>

<HD>Dow, S&amp;P Snap Their 4-Week Losing Streak</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: FBI warning of possible attacks inflicts limited
damage, with Nasdaq reversing mild gains. Telecom stocks slip. Bonds
are mixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks rose Friday on upbeat earnings from International
Paper, but an FBI warning of possible attacks against U.S. financial
institutions sucked wind out of the rally and left the broad market
flat and high-tech issues down.</LD>
<LD>   The damage ultimately was limited, much like Thursday when the
market recovered from midday declines after an airplane crashed into
a skyscraper in Milan, Italy.</LD>
<LD>   By day's end, major indexes had posted their first weekly gains in
at least a month. Bonds were mixed, while gold prices fell and oil
rose slightly.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.83 points, or 0.5%, to
10,257.11. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index finished up less than a
point, or 0.1%, at 1,125.17. The Nasdaq composite index reversed mild
gains and fell 5.60 points, or 0.3%, to 1,796.83.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, but
losers outnumbered winners 8 to 7 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow rose 0.7% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 1.3%,
snapping four-week losing streaks for both indexes. The Nasdaq posted
a weekly gain of 2.3%, ending a five-week skid.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's early rally, sparked by optimism over Microsoft's latest
results, faded as the telecom sector dampened the mood. Microsoft
rose 83 cents to $57.20, but Qwest Communications fell 97 cents to
$6.60 after issuing a profit warning.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications fell $1.17 to $32.72, and BellSouth slid $1.33
to $31.37. WorldCom, down 35 cents to $5.98, and Verizon
Communications, off 45 cents to $42, also got caught in the general
nervousness about the telecom sector. The S&amp;P telecom services index
lost 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Dow member IP, the No. 1 U.S. forest products company, gained 84
cents to $42.17 after it posted a net profit for the first time in
seven quarters on cost-cutting initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the 30 corporate icons in the blue-chip Dow
Jones industrial average had reported their earnings by the close
Friday. It's been a mixed bag of earnings, and investors are
scratching their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a clear indication that earnings are insufficient to
provide upside momentum," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment
officer at investment firm Waddell &amp; Reed. "The market is still
looking for something to take a cue from, and it's yet to be
revealed."</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Adelphia Communications fell 78 cents to $6.28 after the
cable-TV operator said it may be delisted from Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Walt Disney was one of the Dow's biggest gainers, rising 55
cents to $24.95. Goldman Sachs upgraded it to "trading buy" from
"market perform," citing a quicker-than-expected recovery in its
theme park business and continuing signs of a pickup in the
advertising market.</TE>
<TE>   * Transmeta slumped nearly 15% after the low-power semiconductor
designer reported a wider loss and said its chief financial officer
resigned, the latest in a string of executive defections from the
once highflying Silicon Valley start-up. Its shares fell 49 cents to
$2.80.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Says Recession Has Ended, GDP Edges Up 0.7%</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Finance minister says an upswing in U.S.
growth would help accelerate expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANCUN, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Mexico has climbed out of recession and expects to post 0.7%
quarterly growth amid expectations that a U.S. economic resurgence
will propel it even higher later this year, the finance minister said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco Gil Diaz told a convention of Mexican bankers here that
signs of a turnaround are weak but unmistakable and that the
recession has ended after five consecutive quarters of economic
shrinkage.</LD>
<LD>   Gil Diaz said gross domestic product rose 0.7% over the first
three months of the year. The economy was stagnant in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   To reinforce his case, Gil Diaz said that industrial production
showed month-to-month gains in January and February and that exports
by maquiladoras--the plants concentrated in border areas that are a
prime motor of manufacturing growth--rose 2.2% in February.</TE>
<TE>   "Taken together, observing the monthly evolution of the economy,
there exists evidence that the Mexican economy is beginning a new
phase of growth," Gil Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Rangel Domene, president of the Mexican bankers'
association, concurred, saying faint but unmistakable signs of a
recovery are evident amid the bumps in consumer confidence and credit
demand and especially in the 100,000 jobs created after last year's
declines.</TE>
<TE>   Loan applications from Mexican businesses still have not
significantly increased, but that's because of the time it takes
before Mexico feels the effects of the U.S. upturn.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still waiting to feel the favorable impact of a U.S.
recovery," Gil Diaz said, partly because Mexico's economy is not
closely linked to high-technology and defense industries, the sectors
that have benefited most from the incipient recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Domene said that Mexico's economy should grow 1.5% this year and
that in "the second quarter the recovery will be much more evident."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Mexico has become increasingly dependent on the
U.S., where one quarter of Mexico's economic output and 80% of its
exports end up.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Ortiz, the head of Mexico's central bank, said the peso
continues to be strong, not because of any central bank policy but
because the peso, and by implication Mexican financial and business
assets, are in high demand in the global marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for the investment growth include Mexico's improving
productivity, low inflation and prospects for growth, Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investment in Mexican stocks and bonds grew almost 22% in
the first quarter compared with the year-end closing, attracted by
good economic prospects and the upward revision to investment grade
of Mexican sovereign debt by the three principal debt-rating
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Other bullish signs of a recovery are that total internal
investment in Mexico increased in January and the index of business
confidence for increased production, sales and jobs rose in February,
Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico's long-term growth prospects are challenged by the lack
of bank credit, which has effectively dried up since the 1995 banking
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In an address Thursday, President Vicente Fox promised a
legislative campaign to free up credit. He urged bankers to help by
"dusting off the loan machinery ... so that the financial system
returns to becoming a link between savings, investment and growth."</TE>

<HD>Lawyers File Objections to First Alliance Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-profile lawyers are challenging First Alliance Corp.'s record
$60-million-plus settlement of "predatory" lending claims, saying the
proposal unfairly limits their efforts to recover damages from Wall
Street firms that funded the Irvine lender.</LD>
<LD>   The objections, filed this week in federal court in Santa Ana, are
being raised by attorneys including Richard Scruggs, who helped win
billions of dollars from tobacco firms, and Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &amp; Lerach, a firm known for its lawsuits accusing public
companies and executives of misleading investors.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers filed a racketeering lawsuit in February accusing
Lehman Bros. Holdings, Prudential Securities and First Union Bank of
encouraging First Alliance's illegal practices.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed even as lawyers for First Alliance and its
founder, Brian Chisick, were working out their landmark deal to
settle previous claims filed against them.</TE>
<TE>   It appears unlikely that the objections will derail the
settlement. A preliminary hearing on the agreement is set for Monday
before U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who can't rewrite the
settlement but could suggest the parties make changes.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Scruggs and the other lawyers contend the
proposed settlement--announced March 21--is vague and unfairly
restricts them from gathering evidence from First Alliance customers
that they could use in their suit against the Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   They also complain that part of the settlement hasn't been made
public.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous government and private lawsuits accused First Alliance
and Chisick of cheating borrowers nationwide by failing to disclose
onerous fees and interest rate adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement, estimated to provide $60 million to $70
million to 18,000 borrowers, would be the largest ever in a home loan
case, the Federal Trade Commission said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement doesn't include the Wall Street firms, which loaned
money to First Alliance and bundled its loans for sale as
mortgage-backed securities.</TE>
<TE>   David Zlotnick, an attorney in one of the class-action suits, said
in a reply to the Scruggs-Milberg filing that the settlement easily
meets a "fair and reasonable" test and doesn't unfairly restrict the
suit against the Wall Street firms.</TE>

<LD>Tribune Co. reported flat first-quarter operating profit of 32 cents
a share, 3 cents better than analysts' forecasts, and said it expects
second-quarter and full-year earnings "at the upper end of the range
of analyst estimates" because advertising has begun to pick up.</LD>
<LD>   The latest results exclude charges relating to the acquisition of
Times Mirror, whose holdings included the Los Angeles Times. Tribune,
which owns several other newspapers as well as television stations,
said that including the charges, it had a net loss of $108.1 million,
or 33 cents a share, compared with year-ago profit of $63.9 million,
or 20 cents. Revenue fell 4.6% to $1.23 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The company's optimistic tone helped push its shares up $1.87, or
4%, to $46.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<HD>Enron President to Resign in June</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. said President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey
McMahon resigned effective June 1 amid demands by creditors for new
managers with no ties to the energy company's bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   McMahon, 41, was the highest-ranking manager left who worked at
Enron before it admitted to hiding debt and losses through special
partnerships. No replacement has been chosen for McMahon, who had
been working with interim Chief Executive Stephen Cooper on a
reorganization plan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.</LD>
<LD>   The company won't pay him any severance, Palmer said.</LD>
<TE>   Though lawmakers investigating Enron praised McMahon for
questioning the propriety of the partnerships before the company's
collapse, creditors have sought to clean out the executive suite.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, McMahon is one of the wrongdoers, and we don't feel
he belongs at the company," said Andrew Entwistle, an attorney
representing the state of Florida, which lost about $335 million in
Enron investments.</TE>

<LD>* Japan's top telecommunications company, Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone Corp., said it will eliminate 17,000 jobs, or 7.8% of its
work force, as part of a three-year plan to revive its business.</LD>
<LD>   * United Airlines parent UAL Corp.'s first-quarter net loss
widened to $510 million, or $9.22 a share, from a loss of $313
million, or $5.97, a year ago, as the carrier flew fewer passengers
and cut ticket prices to spur demand after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Revenue plunged 26% to $3.29 billion. UAL's operating loss was $487
million, or $8.81 a share, better than the $10.24 estimate of
analysts.</LD>
<LD>   * Alaska Air Group Inc., parent of Alaska Airlines and regional
carrier Horizon Air with mainly West Coast routes, said its loss
widened to $34.4 million, or $1.30 a share, from $33.1 million, or
$1.25 a share, a year ago. Analysts expected a loss of $1.53. Revenue
dropped 3.7% to $496.9 million.</LD>
<TE>   * Delta Air Lines Inc., US Airways Group Inc. and Continental
Airlines Inc. matched AMR Corp.'s American Airlines in raising
leisure fares $20, as they try for the second time this month to
revive revenue after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * Citigroup Inc.'s unit Grupo Financiero Banamex said it is
preparing to launch binational bank accounts for Mexican workers
living in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   * Thales Raytheon Systems of El Segundo reached a deal to sell
radar systems worth about $140 million to French defense electronics
group Thales. Thales Raytheon is Thales' joint venture with Raytheon
Co., the aerospace and defense giant based in Lexington, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   * Compaq Computer Corp. has been asked by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to preserve documents related to its
$20.1-billion acquisition by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. The request
follows a disclosure by Hewlett-Packard this week that the SEC and
the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan are seeking information about
votes on the proposed Hewlett-Compaq merger by Deutsche Bank and
Northern Trust Corp.</TE>
<TE>   * Equity Office Properties Trust, the largest U.S. office building
owner, said its chief executive has resigned for personal reasons,
and real estate mogul Samuel Zell, its chairman, has assumed that
post on an interim basis.</TE>
<TE>   * Univision Music Group, the record arm of Spanish-language
broadcaster Univision Communications Inc., closed an estimated
$210-million deal to acquire Latin music powerhouse Fonovisa Records.
Insiders expect Fonovisa to strike a distribution deal with Vivendi
Universal's Universal Music Group, but the Latin label could opt to
continue handling its own distribution.</TE>
<TE>   * ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. doubled the bonus for Chief Executive
Milan Panic last year amid proxy battles and an ongoing fraud
investigation by U.S. regulators. Panic's bonus rose to $1 million
from $478,700. The drug maker, which makes the ribavirin hepatitis C
drug, also raised Panic's salary to $901,446 from $750,366, according
to a filing with the SEC.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. shares soared 22% after the biggest
operator of Medicare health plans said it won a two-year extension on
$735 million in debt.</LD>
<LD>   Shares rose $4.65 to $26.01 in heavy trading. The shares have more
than doubled since closing at $11.06 on Sept. 21.</LD>
<LD>   PacifiCare said its lenders agreed to extend the debt until
January 2005, giving the company more time to battle rising medical
costs and a lawsuit by the Texas attorney general concerning unpaid
claims. The agreement requires PacifiCare to cut $250 million from
its debt by Jan. 2, the firm said after U.S. markets closed.</LD>
<TE>   PacifiCare, based in Santa Ana, also said it wrote down $897
million in assets in the first quarter to comply with stricter
accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   The action will add about $56 million to earnings in 2002, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock was upgraded to "market outperform" from "market
perform" by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Charles Boorady.</TE>

well but that they involved complex issues.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital shares some facilities with the USC/Norris Cancer
Center, a research institution that would not be part of any

<HD>Starbucks Settles Suit on Overtime</HD>
<DH>Workplace: The firm is one of hundreds to be hit by
class-action lawsuits filed under California's wage-and-hour laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starbucks Corp. said Friday that it has agreed to pay as much as $18
million to settle claims that thousands of current and former
managers and assistant managers in California stores were forced to
spend long hours performing menial tasks and then cheated out of
overtime pay.</LD>
<LD>   Starbucks is one of hundreds of retailers, restaurants and other
businesses to be hit by class-action lawsuits filed under the state's
wage-and-hour laws, which require employers to pay time and a half
after eight hours of work in a day.</LD>
<LD>   This applies even to salaried workers who hold the title of
manager or supervisor if they spend at least 50% of their time
performing tasks that are not related to managing.</LD>
<TE>   Days after the Starbucks suits were filed, a jury in Oakland hit
Farmers Insurance Exchange with a $90-million overtime bill on behalf
of 2,400 claims adjusters.</TE>
<TE>   Several other companies have agreed to settle white-collar
overtime suits. Pacific Bell agreed in December to pay $35 million to
end a lawsuit by 1,500 engineers who alleged they worked 50 hours a
week but were paid for 40. PacBell also has the second-largest
settlement, agreeing in 1997 to end an overtime suit by sales support
managers by paying $27.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Rite Aid Corp. settled with 3,000 managers and assistants
for $25 million, and Bank of America Corp. settled with as many as
6,000 personal assistants for $22 million in October.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are losing more and more of the wage-and-hour
classification cases," said California Chamber of Commerce Vice
President Fred Main.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect that we will see more and more of the cases move
more quickly. [This] has become a ripe area of class-action lawsuits
over the last couple of years. And it moves quickly through one
industry and then on to the next one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest specialty coffee retailer denied liability in
the pair of lawsuits filed in Los Angeles in July and said it agreed
to the settlement to resolve the claims without incurring protracted
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the unique aspects of California wage-and-hour laws, which
differ significantly from federal and other state laws, we believe
this settlement was the best solution for all parties involved,"
Starbucks Senior Vice President Jennifer O'Connor said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Starbucks was one of many companies that has faced this type of
class-action lawsuit in California in recent years."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear, beyond making settlement payments to an estimated
1,000 current employees and an unspecified number of former
employees, whether Starbucks would change the way it paid managers
and assistant managers in California stores. Of the 5,000 Starbucks
worldwide, 821 are in California.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Starbucks declined to answer questions beyond a
statement issued Friday, which said the settlement was subject to a
confidentiality pact. West Los Angeles lawyers Dennis F. Moss and
Rene L. Barge, who represented a group of the plaintiffs, also
declined to comment because of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews in July and in the lawsuits, Starbucks managers and
assistant managers alleged the $2-billion company routinely violated
wage-and-hour laws by requiring them to work more than 40 hours a
week and spend more than half their time on the floor--ringing sales,
cleaning out cappuccino machines, mopping up and other such chores.</TE>
<TE>   Starbucks, which was named to Fortune magazine's "best places to
work in 2002" list, said it would take a one-time charge of 3 cents
per share in the second quarter to reflect the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Starbucks fell 42 cents to $24.98 on Nasdaq after the settlement
was announced.</TE>

<HD>Tech's Recovery Still Far Off</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Companies' cautious spending on upgrades keeps the
industry from making the expected comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite high hopes that the beleaguered tech economy would climb out
of recession this year, quarterly results from industry bellwethers
this week indicate that the long-awaited recovery is still only a
dream.</LD>
<LD>   IBM Corp. reported its steepest drop in earnings in nearly a
decade, blaming corporate customers that held back on technology
spending. Data storage company EMC Corp. posted its third consecutive
quarterly loss after being forced to slash prices in the face of
weakening demand.</LD>
<LD>   Cell phone giant Nokia said it expected to sell 20 million fewer
handsets this year than it previously anticipated. Even soft- ware
behemoth Microsoft Corp. warned that it would miss profit targets for
fiscal 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "We've heard from most of the major companies now, and they all
say the same thing--no pickup in [information technology] spending,"
said Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist, a newsletter
based in Nashua, N.H. "Companies that had been very positive in
January about hitting a bottom are now turning around and saying
there's no pickup. Some are saying they might not see it until 2003."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest factor is that companies are acting cautiously and
postponing investments for major projects such as new systems for
supply chain management or overhauls of the computers that run human
resources departments, said Mark Specker, managing director of
SoundView Technologies Group.</TE>
<TE>   After their budgets have been completed at the beginning of the
year, information technology managers at large corporations typically
begin talking to software vendors such as Oracle Corp., SAP, Siebel
Systems Inc. and Veritas Software Corp. about the projects they plan
to implement.</TE>
<TE>   "They get the first whiff of what projects are going to be hot,
when they're going to be implemented and how big spending is going to
be," Specker said.</TE>
<TE>   But after making their plans, technology managers this year
discovered that the higher-ups who control the purse strings were
unwilling to pay for the projects to go forward. Suddenly, deals that
looked so certain had vaporized, and the software vendors were the
first to break the news to Wall Street, Specker said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the canaries in the coal mine," he said. "They were
singing reasonably cheerily until about the beginning of March. Then
the fumes got them and they fell dead."</TE>
<TE>   The next victims are hardware manufacturers, such as IBM and Sun
Microsystems Inc., which typically see demand spike in June. Instead,
network equipment maker Sun said Thursday that it would cut 1,000
jobs during the next six to nine months after posting a slim fiscal
third-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   Chip companies also are suffering. Although Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. reported strong microprocessor sales and a smaller-than-expected
quarterly loss Wednesday, the company expects unit sales to fall 5%
to 10% next quarter compared with the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Industry leader Intel Corp. expressed optimism about the next
three months after announcing a decline in first-quarter earnings
Tuesday. But analysts are skeptical that demand for PCs will be as
strong as Intel expects.</TE>
<TE>   Massive overcapacity in the telecom sector only compounds the
problem, since providers forced to slash prices can't afford to
invest in their networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Just this week alone we had massive capital spending cuts from
their already depressed levels at SBC, BellSouth, Qwest, Nextel and
Sprint, among others," Hickey said.</TE>
<TE>   The stream of disappointing earnings reports also was due in part
to the expectations of Wall Street, said Jon Ekoniak, senior analyst
with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Menlo Park.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty about the war on terrorism and the shaky recovery
increased demand for solid performers, with analysts setting a high
bar for usually reliable firms such as Microsoft and IBM.</TE>
<TE>   "With the tough quarter, it was very challenging for them to meet
their estimates or, if they did, to keep up the same sort of optimism
going forward," Ekoniak said.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the stocks of several bellwether companies rose at
the end of the week, suggesting that shareholders believe stock
prices have been punished enough.</TE>
<TE>   The one bright spot is consumer-related technology, which is
showing some strength as American households try to spend their way
out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   Brisk demand for Apple Computer Co.'s new flat-panel iMac helped
the company beat analysts' estimates for first-quarter earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-oriented companies benefited from the holiday shopping
season, which allowed them to clear inventories, said Mike Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay. At
the same time, many products are so new that their numbers have
nowhere to go but up.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of new products are out there--everything from digital
cameras to CD burners to DVD players--and those technologies are
still early enough in their growth curves that the recession won't
hurt them," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   But those sales are not enough to pull the rest of tech out of its
two-year slump.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a DVD seller, you're doing great," Hickey said. "The
problem is that's a tiny, tiny amount of what we consider to be the
tech industry. It's driven by computers, telecom and wireless."</TE>

<HD>Big Vivendi Stock Purchase Disclosed</HD>
<DH>Media: In what is seen as a pure investment play, French
corporate raider has acquired 5 million shares of the firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French corporate raider Vincent Bollore has amassed a 5-million-share
stake in Vivendi Universal, adding to the intrigue and management
tumult that have rocked the media conglomerate this week.</LD>
<LD>   Bollore, who has a reputation for shaking up undervalued
companies, last week acquired the 0.5% stake in Vivendi, making him
among the top 10 investors in the Paris-based concern.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier welcomed the investment
as a sign of confidence in the company, whose stock has fallen 35%
this year amid concerns about the company's debt load and Messier's
strategy for converting a water utility into a global media and
entertainment leader.</LD>
<TE>   But it's unclear whether Bollore is friend or foe to Messier and
Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Bollore reportedly has close ties to the French government, which
is furious with Messier over his decision to ax the popular head of
the money-losing Canal Plus pay television group.</TE>
<TE>   The firing touched off a political and cultural uproar in France,
where Canal Plus is the leading financier of French cinema and is a
symbol of the country's cultural independence from the United States.
Vivendi owns Los Angeles-based Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts interpret Bollore's play as a pure investment decision
rather than as the first step in a hostile takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Bollore bought the shares last week when they hit a five-year low
on the Paris Bourse. Vivendi's American depositary receipts closed up
11 cents at $35.41 on Friday in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Bollore has been a major investor in such companies as Lazard
Freres, Peugeot and Mediobanca.</TE>
<TE>   "What this is, very simply, is a financial investor who saw that
Vivendi's shares were undervalued at the time he bought them," said
Mark Harrington, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. "I don't think there's
any hidden agenda with regards to a hostile takeover bid."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Bollore has $1 billion more that he could invest in
Vivendi, but that would give him only a 2.5% stake in the company,
putting him behind the top two investors, the Bronfman family, which
owns 5% of the outstanding shares, and Royal Philips Electronics,
which has a 3.5% stake.</TE>
<TE>   A breakup of the company by a consortium of investors is unlikely,
Harrington said. "There's just no hidden gem within Vivendi that I
think would attract financial investors," he said, citing the
financial losses at Canal Plus and the slowdown in the company's
music business.</TE>
<TE>   "The market capitalization is about $40 billion, so it's still a
sizable offering," said George Nichols, an analyst with Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago. "There aren't many companies that would have the
financial wherewithal to scoop down and grab it."</TE>
<TE>   In what's referred to as the "Messier discount," many analysts are
reducing their valuations of the company by 30% to 40% to reflect
their concerns about Messier's strategy and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's stock has fallen about 50% since the company spent $39
billion acquiring Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios and, separately,
Canal Plus 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   To help boost investor confidence, Vivendi this week said it had
reached an agreement to sell its business and health publishing unit
in a deal that would reduce its debt by about $900 million.</TE>
<TE>   For now, most board members are backing Messier and his decision
to oust Canal Plus' Pierre Lescure, but they disapprove of the public
and embarrassing way in which the management overhaul was handled, as
well as Messier's previous statements criticizing French film
subsidies, sources familiar with the board say.</TE>

<HD>A Sucker Punch Against Smoking</HD>
<DH>Listen up, FDA: Nicotine lollipops beat the gum and the
patch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN CARTER</AU>
<BD>Sean Carter is a lawyer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a smoker, I can attest that, with the possible exceptions of
performing neurosurgery, playing the violin or operating a
"childproof" lighter, there is nothing more difficult than quitting
smoking. This is not to say that it is impossible to quit. In fact,
I've quit smoking several times.</LD>
<LD>   Because of people such as myself, an entire industry has grown
around smoking cessation. Several companies offer nicotine gum and
patches. And recently, some companies have began to market new
nicotine-laden products, such as nicotine lip balm and even nicotine
water.</LD>
<LD>   In my efforts to quit smoking, I've tried many of these products.
They all seem to have at least one major drawback.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, the nicotine gum is wonderful for getting a quick
nicotine "pick-me-up" when you can't light up. However, as you can
imagine, it doesn't go particularly well with an after-dinner wine.
Moreover, I find it difficult to justify leaving my office at work
every 15 minutes to take a gum break.</TE>
<TE>   The nicotine patch has one major advantage: simplicity. You simply
stick the patch to your arm and all of your nicotine needs are met
for the day. Well, almost all of them.</TE>
<TE>   For one, the nicotine patch doesn't satisfy the oral and manual
fixations that afflict many smokers. Second, most smokers are not
craving a constant flow of nicotine. Rather, look for an abrupt
change in body chemistry, which helps us stave off boredom, stress
and annoying nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I was excited when I heard about a new
smoking-cessation aid hitting the market: nicotine lollipops. The
lollipops seemed to provide good solutions to the major drawbacks of
the gum and the patch. Moreover, you can still look cool sucking on a
lollipop. After all, it worked for Telly Savalas on the hit TV show
"Kojak." And let's face it, trying to look cool is what made most of
us take up smoking in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   However, before I could shave my head and start saying, "Who loves
you, baby?" the Food and Drug Administration halted the sale of
nicotine lollipops. According to the FDA, the nicotine used in the
lollipops, nicotine salicylate, has not been tested for safety or
effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's action in this matter is questionable for a number of
reasons. For one, when did the FDA gain jurisdiction over nicotine
products? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, not the FDA,
oversees the tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   As a legal matter, the FDA has about as much control over
cigarettes as I have over my children.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the FDA claims that it has jurisdiction over
smoking-cessation aids because they are "drugs." And the FDA's policy
is to test all drugs before they are sold. This is the kind of
backward thinking that typifies large bureaucracies and my wife's
side of the family.</TE>
<TE>   After all, maybe it's just me, but I'm willing to take my chances
with the lollipops. In fact, I don't care if they contain trace
elements of gasoline, Drano or my wife's meatloaf; they have to be
safer than cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   However, the FDA disagrees. As a result, a "drug" that could
possibly reduce smoking deaths will be held up for safety reasons
while cigarettes will continued to be sold to the same people being
"protected" by the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   In answer to Kojak's immortal question, "Who loves you, baby?":
certainly not the FDA.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I first came through the doors of Goodwill Industries in
December 1999, I was futureless, jobless and hopeless. I never
thought I would have a career in anything, especially not in banking.</LD>
<LD>   I never knew there were people in the world who sincerely cared
enough to help the underprivileged and disadvantaged become
productive members of not only the work force but of the community.</LD>
<LD>   I was a recovering drug addict with a ninth-grade education and no
job experience. Goodwill Industries did not give me weird looks or
whisper behind my back. When they discovered that I had a criminal
record as a result of my substance abuse, they did not slap a mop in
my hand and say, "That's the best we can do for you." Instead, they
gave me confidence and trust. They encouraged me to enroll in a GED
preparation course; I received my high school diploma in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   I attended a job development class while working as a retail clerk
at one of the Goodwill stores in downtown Los Angeles. I would be at
the train station by 6 a.m. and come home at 8 p.m. It was quite a
relief when I finally did land a 9-to-5 job.</TE>
<TE>   I was hired as a direct banking associate, where I provide
customer service for retail sales and accounts and assist in the loan
support area.</TE>
<TE>   When I was chosen to participate in the "Go the Distance" Learning
Project (an online training course taken on a computer placed in the
participant's home), I was floored. Not only did I have a successful
and promising career, but with acceptance into this program I also
now had an opportunity to advance that career.</TE>
<TE>   I took the supervision/management course and learned how to become
a leader, monitor and spokesperson for my associates. I've learned
how to communicate with individuals and meet their needs without
bending too far, how to deal with personalities with professionalism
and not to take things personally; how to maintain a business focus
without being a complete drone. These skills are an essential part of
my growth at my present job.</TE>
<TE>   I've learned what part I play in the growth and development of the
company, how important it is to be a team player.</TE>
<TE>   I found this course to be not only interesting, useful and fun,
but time-manageable, which was very important for the participants
who work, go to school and maintain a household.</TE>
<TE>   I am now seriously considering starting to go for a degree in
business management in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   "Go the Distance" has participants who have fallen victim to
circumstance, such as women whose husbands left them or died, pushing
them into the work force to become the sole provider for the family
for the first time. Others are single parents trying to develop
skills to better support their household.</TE>
<TE>   The program has encouraged me to strive for a positive life
regardless of what others may say or do to discourage me. I've
learned there are no life experiences or obstacles that can't be
overcome; no boundaries, odds or statistics that can't be beaten as
long as we are willing to work very hard.</TE>

<LD>Wind Bell: Teachings From</LD>
<LD>   the San Francisco Zen Center 1968-2001</LD>
<LD>   Michael Wenger, editor</LD>
<TE>   North Atlantic Books</TE>
<TE>   220 pages, $14.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last year, I reviewed on this page "Shoes Outside the Door,"
Michael Downing's absorbing account of what his subtitle called
"Desire, Devotion and Excess at the San Francisco Zen Center."</TE>
<TE>   It offered a saddening view of the internal politics, the dubious
business dealings and the exploitation of well-intentioned spiritual
aspiration that, during the mid-1980s, threatened to undermine this
effort to root Zen Buddhist practice in American soil.</TE>
<TE>   Now, thankfully, comes "Wind Bell" as a lively antidote,
presenting a broad spectrum of teachings and personal experiences
from the same center over the last 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Wind Bell" is an anthology of texts culled from the center's
eponymous newsletter, which has been published with varying
regularity since 1961. The book's editor, Michael Wenger, also a
practitioner and teacher at the center, has edited or co-edited the
newsletter on and off since 1984. He wisely chooses to anchor his
selection in three key texts transcribed from lectures by Shunryu
Suzuki, the center's founder, inspiration and presiding roshi, or
spiritual leader, until his death in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki's well-known "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" is an
indispensable guide to Zen thought and practice, and the lectures
here reveal the subtle mind of a seminal teacher whose peculiar
talent was to make both the uncompromising, self-evident simplicity
of Zen and its subtle, sometimes bewilderingly obtuse sophistication
accessible to the rational Western mind. "Form is emptiness," says
its basic, now familiar paradox. "Emptiness is form."</TE>
<TE>   For Suzuki, the purpose of Zen was to transcend the constantly
shifting, illusory world of self by learning through practice "to be
free from thinking mind and emotional activity."</TE>
<TE>   Wenger next devotes a generous section to the center's other
teachers. Many of the contributors will be familiar to those with
anything more than a passing acquaintance with the literature:
Richard Baker, Suzuki's successor as roshi, on mind-body awareness;
Mel Weitsman on the four Buddhist views of love; Yvonne Rand on
"Cultivating Beginner's Mind," in which she poses the question "How
can I be a beginner in each moment, even in those situations where I
am doing something that I have done many times before?"; and Reb
Anderson in a wonderfully lucid exploration of the deceptively simple
art of shikantaza, or "just sitting."</TE>
<TE>   We get a sense, in these highly individual voices, of the depth of
personal authenticity and the devotion to practice that form the
spiritual guts of the center--an impression reinforced in a later
section on sacred ritual, including the text of the "Lay Bodhisattva
Initiation Ceremony" for those wishing to make a solemn commitment to
the Zen path and personal accounts of the "Dharma Transmission" of
the responsibilities of priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its resident teachers, the center has attracted as
visitors many of the leading figures in the propagation of Buddhist
thinking in the West.</TE>
<TE>   They, too, are substantially represented here, including Robert
Thurman, in a hip, meandering investigation of the Vimalakirti Sutra
on the nature of non-duality; and Thich Nhat Hanh's gently lyrical
teaching on "Watering the Seeds of Buddhism" in the simplest acts of
daily life.</TE>
<TE>   A final section, drawn mainly from the writings of lay
practitioners, follows up on this theme by elaborating on the variety
of applications of Zen to ordinary life experiences--from parenting
to creative work, from the practice of healing to the gentle art of
caring for the dying.</TE>
<TE>   Is Zen a "religion"? Certainly some of the teachings
here--including the introductory lecture by Suzuki on the
relationship between the Nirmanakaya Buddha (the historical Buddha),
the Sambhogakaya Buddha (the "Perfect One, or Truth Itself") and the
Dharmakaya Buddha (the "fundamental, undeveloped Buddha
Body")--suggest belief in an all-powerful being and a structural
underpinning of dogma and ritual.</TE>
<TE>   More than in other faiths, however, practice weighs significantly
over belief in Zen Buddhism.</TE>
<TE>   "Just sitting" becomes a way of living one's life in acceptance of
suffering, impermanence and mortality.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the work and example of the San Francisco Zen Center,
more and more people today are engaged in the practice, and "Wind
Bell" offers us a rich tapestry of individual voices--and some
photos, mostly of a "family snapshot" variety--all contributing to
the picture of a center truly back on mission.</TE>

<LD>The question of why someone would climb a mountain continues to tease
us long after George Leigh Mallory's mocking response, "Because it's
there." The riddle has fresh intensity since 1996, when a sudden
storm caught and killed eight climbers near the summit of the
29,035-foot Mt. Everest. Any answer is about as good as another. But
one thing that hooks people on climbing is reading, and author Robert
Roper's excellent new biography of Everest pioneer Willi Unsoeld
explores that point.</LD>
<LD>   Climbers aren't like tennis players or football players, he argues
in "Fatal Mountaineer." "They have their noses deep in books when
young, and after being thrilled by the great figures from the past
they become mad to do the thing themselves." He adds that "an amazing
number" of Unsoeld's friends and fellow climbers were motivated by
reading accounts of past expeditions.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Houston, for one, became obsessed with climbing after
reading G. W. Young's "On High Hills" at the age of 12. There is
anecdotal evidence that many others' early steps toward the peaks
were first made in their imaginations. Their literary guides include
Eric Shipton and Harold Tilman, the pioneer British explorers of the
Himalaya; Chris Bonington, Heinrich Harrar, Gaston Rebuffat, Walter
Bonatti and Lionel Terray.</LD>
<TE>   Many cite "Annapurna," Maurice Herzog's account of the 1950 first
ascent of an 8,000- meter peak, a select group of 14 of the world's
tallest mountains. Until recent years, this was the most popular
mountaineering book of them all. But it has since been eclipsed by
Jon Krakauer's chilling chronicle of the 1996 Everest disaster, "Into
Thin Air."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas B. Clinch of Palo Alto, a former president of the
American Alpine Club who has an extensive mountaineering library,
accepts Roper's argument up to a point. Clinch's experience is that
young people make a first brush with climbing, often at the
invitation of a friend or mentor, and then begin fueling their
passion by reading. There's little question, however, of the
mountains-to-books link. Clinch himself wrote "A Walk in the Sky,"
about the American expedition that made the first ascent of
Gasherbrum in Pakistan in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Roper notes that the early expedition books often were idealized
epics of exotic lands, full of stiff upper lips and muddling through.
Personality conflicts were glossed over in favor of the sportsmanship
and teamwork needed to get a climber to the top. The trend changed in
the 1970s, along with much else in life, to include clashes over who
got to be on the summit team, the challenging of leaders' judgment,
fights over climbing style and ethics, breathless love affairs at
high camps and graphic descriptions of hygiene problems.</TE>
<TE>   Many youngsters now start climbing on artificial walls in gyms,
with some gravitating to outdoor rock climbing areas. Would they be
inspired to greater heights by Harrar's "White Spider" or Terray's
"Conquistadors of the Useless"? Most would be content to stay in the
gym. But there will always be a tiny fraction who come away with a
passion that sends them toward white, distant summits.</TE>

<LD>Channeling Sierra Nevada water to Southern California was one of the
great engineering feats of its day, and in 1915 Los Angeles annexed
the San Fernando Valley mainly because the aqueduct that brought that
water ended there. Almost 100 years later, the Valley's effort to
secede from the city is a monumental reverse-engineering challenge.</LD>
<LD>   How do voters go about untangling a century's worth of water
mains, sewer pipes, power lines, computer networks, employee pension
plans and bond obligations, not to mention the history, that have
come to knit the Valley to the rest of Los Angeles? And what would be
the result?</LD>
<LD>   As secession winds its way to an almost certain vote in November,
the Los Angeles chapter of the League of Women Voters has drawn
voters a blueprint to help them understand the debate's complexities.
In addition to sponsoring candidate debates, the nonprofit,
nonpartisan league works to clarify major issues; its 60-page report
calls the prospective ballot measure the most important here since
voters approved the bonds to build the Los Angeles Aqueduct.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately the league found so many differences between the city's
and secession advocates' figures, analyses and projections that it
couldn't say what a new Valley city would be like. Should secession
pass, some issues will probably be settled by the courts, others
negotiated over the next several years. Voters, the report concluded,
would have to decide in November "based on faith, and only a rather
vague vision, that somehow it will all work out."</TE>
<TE>   How can voters make that decision with so many questions
unanswered? The league, which will take a position itself before the
November election, suggests that residents counter the uncertainty by
asking still more questions: Will secession achieve the goals that
its proponents claim? Will I, and my community, be better off? How
will dividing Los Angeles affect the future of the region?</TE>
<TE>   Take schools, a source of dissatisfaction for Los Angeles
residents on both sides of Mulholland Drive. The city does not
oversee the Los Angeles Unified School District, so Valley secession
would not break up or otherwise "fix" the school district, as many
people believe.</TE>
<TE>   The report traces some of the frustrations underlying secession to
the changes that have reshaped and in some cases unsettled much of
Southern California over the last 30 years, from the loss of
aerospace jobs that supported middle-class families to demographic
shifts that have made Los Angeles one of the most diverse cities on
Earth. Would splitting Los Angeles into the nation's third- and
sixth-largest cities restore a sense of community or just cost it
clout? This is the kind of question that's being argued passionately
and the kind of question that needs to be raised when deciding
whether to take apart one of the world's best-known cities.</TE>

<LD>Media-savvy youngsters tend to ignore traditional advertising, so
marketers always are on the prowl for new gimmicks. The hip
skateboarding apparel company Etnies hit the jackpot in Lake Forest,
where it bought the naming rights to a planned municipal skate park.
This will, among other things, put Etnies' name on the lips of
hundreds of youngsters--as in "meet you at Etnies after school." This
deal, however, is out of bounds in taking a straight marketing shot
at children in a public park.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County city got a paltry $100,000 from Etnies, 10% of
the cost of the park. That's pocket change in a world where Coors
will spend a reported $300 million to join the NFL's advertising
team. Selling beer to adults, though, isn't the same as using a city
park to make a sales pitch to young skateboarders. Etnies is also
selling its T-shirts on the city Web site (albeit with profits going
to the skate park) and negotiated exclusive use of the public park on
certain occasions.</LD>
<LD>   Cash-strapped local governments and organizations have taken
eagerly to the "if we build it, they will sponsor it" mentality. The
rush to generate sponsorships stretches from the Rose Bowl, now
scrambling to find a corporate replacement for AT&amp;T, to Hollywood,
where athletic shoe maker Vans Inc. financed "Dogtown and Z Boys," a
critically acclaimed skateboarding documentary.</LD>
<TE>   Lake Forest, however, should have followed the lead of San
Clemente, which named a park after a slain policeman and used a
modest sign to acknowledge a $100,000 corporate donation for an
accompanying skate park. In the words of a San Clemente official,
"Lake Forest sold out." The best deterrent to a repeat would be for
skateboarders to see Etnies as part of the establishment, and thus
anathema.</TE>

<LD>How ironic that in the same issue that The Times writes of the
destruction of hills, streams and homes in the search for coal ("The
Steep Cost of Cleaner, Cheaper Coal," April 14) there would appear an
advertisement for home photovoltaic systems (Page A31). The new
generation of solar shingles has proven itself effective in providing
up to 40% of a household's electrical needs in locations as diverse
as sunny Southern California and cold, cloudy Holland, according to
Guillermo Hernandez, adjunct professor of architecture at Woodbury
University and head of the DWP's Solar L.A. project.</LD>
<LD>   This innovative product requires no batteries or special
equipment: The energy feeds directly into the power grid and the
homeowner's meter runs backward, paying for itself in six to 10
years. Currently, the DWP will subsidize 40% of the cost of
installing these systems. Considering the cost to both the
environment and people's health, wouldn't it make sense for the
federal government to step in and pick up the balance?</LD>
<LD>   A 100% rebate, offered nationwide, would immediately end our
dependence on foreign oil, save our environment and produce millions
of new jobs. Instead, the Bush administration wants to further relax
coal mining standards.</LD>
<TE>   Charles Crawford</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the Bush administration to rewrite mining and dumping
regulations to suit President Bush's and his industry cronies' narrow
interests reduces the president to little more than a common dictator
who changes the rules. And the fact that many members of his own
party have implored him to cease his slash-and-burn environmental
policies only underscores the fact that this man is seriously out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, Interior Secretary Gale Norton and the rest of the industry
shills seem unconcerned that they're also destroying the lives of the
residents of Appalachia and other environmentally sensitive areas.
This wholesale destruction of irreplaceable natural resources for
short-term financial gain, plus the betrayal of the people affected,
will not only be Bush's domestic legacy but will be an issue that he
will be hard-pressed to defend come 2004.</TE>

<HD>Forced to Pay Child Support</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your April 15 article, "DNA Shakes Up Child Support Laws," proves
that men are often trapped into parental roles when they have no
desire to be parents. Fathers have minimal legal rights and huge
legal financial responsibilities.</LD>
<LD>   If sociologists were really concerned about the importance of the
role of fathers, they wouldn't only look at how much money a father
can provide but would realize that a father should be more than a
weekend visitor. A father paying child support should have the right
to see that his support payments are going toward the children he's
supporting, and he should have equal input into the decisions being
made concerning his children. To force a man to pay support payments
to a child he does not claim as his is an outrage.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Davis</LD>
<TE>   Covina</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two possible solutions to keep these situations from occurring in
the future: 1) Mandate DNA testing for newborn babies and their
parents. Some people might find this too Big Brother-ish, so an
alternative is: 2) Require DNA testing in all child support court
cases. In addition, require DNA testing of any man paying child
support, if paternity has not been previously established, or have
the man waive his right to the testing.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Klipper</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article is a wonderful illustration of the warped attitudes
of some organizations. Taking the twisted logic of these groups one
step further, an individual falsely condemned to death row would
still be executed for the good of the victim's relations if some
relatively short period of time passed prior to exonerating DNA
analysis. A man having a substantial portion of his income
expropriated to support someone else's child is not a father but
rather a victim of the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Buehler</TE>
<TE>   Corona</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although I agree that the welfare of children is important enough
to force a man to pay for a child who didn't turn out to be his, I
think there should be consequences for the mother who has repeatedly
lied and broken the law. After having had sex with at least two
different men in a short period of time, she chooses the most
gullible of the group to exploit. She lies to him, she lies to a
judge and she lies on the birth certificate.</TE>
<TE>   I suggest that on the child's 18th birthday, the mother should
become liable for past child support and pay it back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "An Rx Against Violence," editorial, April 14: The analogy you
used of the injured person refusing paramedic help to expose the
lunacy of our policy for the mentally ill homeless was right on the
mark. Here's another: By law, a minor is deemed incapable of making
the decision to live on the street, yet we let a mentally incompetent
person make such a decision. So why is it that being mentally ill is
a valid legal defense for murder (the mentally ill offender cannot
tell right from wrong), yet being mentally ill isn't a reason to get
a person off the street?</LD>
<LD>   The unholy alliance, during the Gov. Reagan era, of the right wing
(which wanted to cut spending) and the left-wing libertarians (who
wanted to free the institutionalized) has been a complete and total
failure. Running a mental institution on our streets is clearly
ruining our cities. Surely we can do better for those who need (but
don't know they need) help.</LD>
<LD>   Tomas Fuller</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is a strange logic that suggests that the consequences of lack
of treatment for the "small percentage of people" who are both
violent and labeled "mentally ill" are somehow "just as bad" as the
historic and continuing mistreatment of those who have found
themselves in the care of the mental health system. To my knowledge,
no study has been done comparing violence perpetrated by the mentally
ill with the violence imposed upon them by those into whose care they
have, voluntarily or forcibly, been entrusted.</TE>
<TE>   It is not our expectation of caregivers that they will insult,
humiliate, rape, assault and, without informed consent, conduct
dangerous experiments upon those in their care. Yet only the poorly
informed, or the mendaciously self-interested, would deny that this
has been the lot of many thousands of the psychiatrically diagnosed.
And this is in addition to the not-so-infrequent damage done by
mental health treatments themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal now surrounding revelations of mistreatment of
vulnerable individuals by persons acting under cover of piety within
the Catholic Church suggests that none of our institutions should be
immune from public scrutiny. Neither should the experiences of those
who fear, mistrust or challenge venerated institutions be easily
dismissed for no better reason than the public's need for
self-deception. The record of our mainstream mental health system is
hardly so free of taint that any of us should offer it our unexamined
trust, much less those who have experienced its ministrations or
those upon whom we would force its services by government edict.</TE>
<TE>   Both public and private safety are better served by an imperfect
but largely transparent justice system than by a mental health system
that protects an unknown but too-high percentage of wolves in sheep's
clothing.</TE>

<HD>Support for the Salton Sea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Salton Sea Sticking Point in Water Deal" (April 14) says that the
Salton Sea "is a place that was never supposed to be." The Salton Sea
is only the most recent of a series of much larger lakes that have
filled the basin--collectively called prehistoric Lake Cahuilla.
Carbon dates of travertine deposits and lake-related archeological
remains indicate that the sea was full more than half of the time
over the past 1,300 years.</LD>
<LD>   Your article says the sea is polluted with "agricultural
pesticides and Mexican sewage." Studies of water and sediments found
only trace amounts of pesticides and other pollutants in the sea.
Fecal coliform bacteria levels from sewage were well below EPA health
thresholds. You say that restoration plans "will only delay the sea's
demise from extreme salinity." Solar evaporation ponds, in
conjunction with on-sea desalination, provide proven solutions to
rising salinity. For as little as $300 million ($6 per household in
Southern California), solar ponds can remove the salts from the sea.</LD>
<TE>   If water transfers go forward, salinity will skyrocket. The
fishery will collapse, and 200 million dead fish will then represent
a real odor problem. Millions of migratory birds will lose one of
their last critical stopovers on their already imperiled journeys.
Lowering of the sea will expose more than 100 miles of fine
lake-bottom sediments, representing a huge impact on already poor air
quality in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.</TE>
<TE>   It is L.A.'s and San Diego's wasteful water use that is the real
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Krantz</TE>
<TE>   Program Director</TE>
<TE>   Salton Sea Database Program</TE>
<TE>   University of Redlands</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This article failed to mention that on March 28 the Salton Sea
Authority and the Imperial Irrigation District voted unanimously to
support a resolution opposing water transfers of any amount from the
Salton Sea that would pose significant negative impacts on wildlife
or expose enough shoreline to create a human health hazard by
airborne dust. This critical move was approved the previous month by
Riverside County, local Indian tribes, Palm Springs and other
municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   However, even more upsetting was your morose and inaccurate
portrayal of the surreally beautiful Salton Sea. The color of water
is not evidence of pollution. By the time the waters of the New River
and other tributaries travel across miles of desert to reach the
Salton Sea, no significant levels of contaminants have been found in
regular state monitoring. In fact, lifeguards at the Salton Sea State
Recreation Area are not even required to be inoculated, though their
counterparts along the polluted Pacific shoreline certainly need to
be.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Haddad</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't help but wonder why seawater is not part of the
environmental solution to this ever-increasing problem of salt and
pollutant buildup in the Salton Sea. As the Salton Sea is below sea
level, no energy would be required to pump seawater into the sea and,
indeed, some electricity could be generated that could be used to
pump high-salt brine and agricultural waste-water rich in pesticides
and herbicides seaward. The use of seawater could regulate the
shoreline, allowing for development of this area, improve water
quality and end the fight over the ever-diminishing fresh-water
resource.</TE>

<LD>Re "Shoe Logo on a Park? Lake Forest Says It's a Good Fit," April 14:
They make obscenely large gifts to politicians who will lower their
taxes, shred the safety net and ax public amenities, and if that's
not enough, the corporations dodge their community responsibilities
by going offshore. No wonder we're disgusted when they throw us a few
pennies, then demand their logo be placed on our parks, on our bus
benches, on our sports venues and (coming soon) on our public
toilets. Mervyn's even has its logo on an interpretive plaque in
Yosemite. Oh, we are so grateful!</LD>

<LD>Re "Close House Races Go the Way of Rotary Phones, Newt Gingrich"
(April 15), on the entrenched incumbency of House members: Ronald
Brownstein overlooks one crucial factor, namely, the desire by many
people to live in a district that has a representative whose views
mirror their own.</LD>
<LD>   Since moving here in 1981, I've been represented by Henry Waxman,
Howard Berman, Tony Beilenson, Brad Sherman and now Berman again--all
Democrats and all fairly liberal. And that's just fine with me. I
wouldn't want to live in an area where my neighbors would send
someone like Tom DeLay (R-Texas) to Congress term after term--just as
I'm sure his constituents feel the same way about Waxman. So we
voters must shoulder a goodly portion of the blame for this mess
we're in.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Schlesinger</LD>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brownstein isn't telling us anything we didn't figure out years
ago: Our votes don't count. But the "less benign factors" he
enumerated ignore one writ large--third-party challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting is not the only legal process available to
incumbents determined to stay in office. Limiting third-party and
independent-candidate challenges is the other, and challengers from a
variety of ideological positions are routinely prevented from gaining
ballot status. It's all legal and commonly upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   The tinkering with campaign financing and the rhetoric about
corporate influence, accountability and full disclosure miss the
mark. Yet there is an effective way for guaranteeing representation
that would be acceptable to the majority of U.S. voters. Moreover, it
has stood the test of time in Western democracies where voter turnout
far exceeds our own. It's called proportional representation, and it
can take many forms, including a method that just passed muster with
San Francisco voters--instant runoff voting.</TE>

<LD>Re "Century City Project Upsets Some Residents," April 14: I recently
purchased a condominium in Century City because, as a former New
Yorker, I longed for a mixed-use, walking-friendly environment. I
envisioned walking to work and shopping. The Shubert Theatre was a
powerful and treasured reason I chose the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   I would urge the developers of the site to consider what a
wonderful opportunity they have to put retail shops at the ground
level, facing the Avenue of the Stars, which could draw not only the
4,000 residents of the condominium homes nearby but also the many
thousands of visitors from the three luxury hotels directly across
the street. Perhaps a small theater the size of the Canon Theatre
could be incorporated for an "off-Broadway" venue, which would be
profitable and bring many more shoppers to the complex.</LD>
<LD>   This is an opportunity for visionary development that provides
people with a neighborhood that could be copied elsewhere.</LD>

shouldn't worry about the current stoppage of certain oil imports
because "Saudi Arabia and others--what others?--"are expected to make

about raising gas mileage standards, I heard much the same assurances
from those of a more conservative stripe so as to downplay the
"lessen dependence on foreign oil" argument.</LD>
<LD>   So there we have it. Liberals and conservatives agree that we
shouldn't worry too much about short-term oil import problems because
we can rely on Saudi Arabia to get us out of trouble.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for printing "Stark, Bitter Debate Plays Out Over Dunes"
(April 15), about the ongoing strife between off-roaders and
environmentalists. Off-roaders' attorney Bill Horn got to the bottom
of the debate when he observed that traditional outdoors people don't
want to hear the roar of a dune buggy while they camp. He goes on to
claim that this is not a legal basis to limit the use of public
property. I beg to differ.</LD>
<LD>   Off-road vehicles are noisy, smelly, leave ugly tracks in nature,
contribute to air pollution and threaten the native wildlife with
habitat destruction. Public policy states that the public lands are
to be used sustainably. With the growing, uncontrolled use of these
machines, our natural wild areas are being overrun and quiet areas
for city folk to go to for respite from the noise and pressure of the
urban environment are becoming scarce.</LD>
<LD>   We've got to say no to off-road vehicles now.</LD>

<TE>   As a Californian who enjoys many forms of motorized recreation, I
feel that your article stereotypes vehicle users as one and the same.
Exploring a remote canyon at Lake Powell on a personal watercraft or
riding an all-terrain vehicle in the Imperial Sand Dunes allows me to
see more than one could on foot. Motorized recreation is not the
reckless and dangerous endeavor portrayed by those who feel public
land should be limited to pedestrian access.</TE>
<TE>   The National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have
a difficult task in balancing the needs of the different user groups
and protecting the environment for future generations. The lawsuits
brought by anti-motorized recreation groups have drained the
resources of the agencies responsible for governing the land.
Litigation, not scientific research, has shaped current land-use
policies. Fair evaluation of environmental impact should be done to
set guidelines for public land use.</TE>

<TE>   I'm both an off-roader and an environmentalist. I am always amazed
at how shortsighted policies can be that open up areas loaded with
rare and poorly understood plants and animals. Only recently, gila
monster venom was found to contain what may be an antidote to
Alzheimer's; who would think that wiping out something that rare and
ugly would have any effect on the human race?</TE>
<TE>   Far too little is known about the biology of the Algodones to
allow further destruction with a glib wave of the hand. What a lot of
people don't know is that there are levels of habitat required to
sustain many species in any given area. That amount increases
exponentially with decreasing resources, such as those found in dune
areas. So even if you don't directly destroy a plant or animal
species, if you ruin the area near or around it you may kill off its
pollinators or food sources and doom it anyway.</TE>

<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and Assembly members Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento) and Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro) should be
complimented on their bill to protect consumers from unapproved
charges (April 16). The problem is not the sale of information to
marketeers by the banks but the banks' payment of unauthorized
charges. When you complain to the bank that there is no contract or
signed debit slip, they call it a "non-sweep transaction." They tell
you that only the vendor can cancel the charge. You are then forced
into their own tedious appeals process.</LD>
<LD>   The banks are more loyal to vendors who bring in lots of business
than to the clients to whom they have a fiduciary responsibility. The
law should be changed to force banks to cancel charges at the request
of the client when no contract can be proven by the vendor. A few
losses by the banks would curtail the process.</LD>

<HD>Slow Down Fast Food With a Veggie Burger</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a shame that Rich Ganis' "Burger King Uncowed" (Opinion, April
14) presented the "BK Veggie" in such a negative light, because the
fate of millions of animals depends on this product's success. In the
article I was quoted as cautioning that if the BK Veggie flops, "it
might set the growth of the movement [to protect animals] back 10
years."</LD>
<LD>   Ganis dismissed my assertion by saying, "That's an awful lot to
hang on the fate of one sandwich. The truth is, Burger King's new
entree will do little to keep animals out of the slaughterhouse."</LD>
<LD>   Ganis' claim that the BK Veggie won't significantly reduce
slaughter is astonishing and utterly wrong. As a longtime vegan, I'm
no fan of Burger King. But the BK Veggie is of the utmost importance
to farm animals and could stop more animal slaughter than any food
product in history. Yet Ganis pooh-poohs this product because it's
not perfect nutritionally, environmentally or socially.</LD>
<TE>   The BK Veggie isn't perfect, but in each of these spheres the
product offers clear-cut advantages over its meat-based counterparts.
If the BK Veggie fails, it will torpedo any chance that McDonald's or
Wendy's will introduce a similar product. The fate of countless
animals is riding on its success.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Marcus</TE>
<TE>   Newfield, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thoughtful discussion of the health, environmental and humane
implications of Burger King's veggie burger is much welcomed. Ganis'
piece could be much improved by the simple inclusion of comparative
nutrition data between the veggie burger and the cow-based burger.
His criticisms of corporate food production are well-founded.
However, it may be unwise to allow the perfect to become the enemy of
the good.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "County Shelves Plan for Early Learning Center at the Mall," April
11: The L.A. County Office of Education changed plans about where to
place an innovative preschool learning center because of a change in
funding. The original request was for a $2.1-million appropriation.
What was finally received, while still generous, was only $440,000.
This crucial funding difference--nearly $1.7 million--was not
mentioned in the story.</LD>
<LD>   In December 2001, after getting the news, the LACOE began
reviewing other options for the project. This revised planning was
based on the new fiscal reality. We are grateful for funding to help
ensure that young children are ready to learn when they begin school.
We take pride in being fiscally and educationally responsible. And we
view our new plans for a partnership with the county's Women, Infants
and Children nutrition centers as an effective and cost-efficient way
to aid communities in need.</LD>

<LD>Diane Halpern makes a convincing case in her April 16 commentary,
"Create Work Policies Fit for a Mom." What is missing is how other
developed nations deal with the problem of a market economy that
denies the basic biological and spiritual needs of women to bear and
nurture children, demanding that they work for wages instead.</LD>
<LD>   Women in other developed nations are helped to bear and nurture
children with taxes: paid universal health care; paid maternity and
paternity leave, as in Scandinavia, permitting the nonworking parent
to bond with the newborn; adequate child care, as in France; public
education, K-college; adequate after-school recreation programs; and
transition from school to apprenticeship or a job. The precedents
exist for public policy and parents, together, providing the
essentials of meaningful, loving care of the young, which are denied
working women and their children in the richest country in history.</LD>

<HD>Winning Decathlon Team Faces Questions</HD>
<DH>Contest: The top scorer from the school that beat Moorpark
at U.S. academic finals may have been ineligible due to poor grades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Ramlow has a D-plus average. He also earned the distinction of
top scorer in the nation at the U.S. Academic Decathlon last week,
with 8,678 points.</LD>
<LD>   But Ramlow shouldn't have been allowed to compete, says Moorpark
High School, which narrowly lost to Ramlow's team, Waukesha West High
School in Wisconsin.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether the 17-year-old, who won several gold medals,
was ineligible after his grades slipped below a threshold set by a
Waukesha School District policy.</LD>
<TE>   "The question is, are they going to do what's right?" said Larry
Jones, a history teacher who has coached the Moorpark team on and off
for nine years. "They created this policy, then they decided to
ignore their own rules. Most schools don't have that luxury."</TE>
<TE>   But the revelation apparently will not change the final outcome, a
fact that has upset school officials in Moorpark. The nine
decathletes on Moorpark's team finished just 579 points behind
Waukesha at the finals April 11 and 12 in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Ramlow's mother disputed the idea that he should not have
qualified for the national event, citing his 1.833 cumulative GPA,
according to the Milwaukee Journal. The rules, however, are more
specific.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin policy--common among school districts
nationwide--bars students from participating in extracurricular
activities or sports if their grade point average falls below 1.5 or
if they earn more than one F. Eligibility, however, is determined by
quarter grades.</TE>
<TE>   The youth said he learned only this week that he was not eligible.
He said he believed that semester marks determined whether he could
remain on the team, not his quarter grades.</TE>
<TE>   "I made sure I passed enough to be able to compete, and we all
thought that I was qualified," he said. "Being an underachiever is
kind of rough, and that's what I loved about decathlon. I got a
chance to do my best."</TE>
<TE>   School officials in Wisconsin did not return calls Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But Molly Ritchie, director of that state's academic decathlon,
said the grade policy is enforced only on sports teams, not on other
extracurricular activities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Academic Decathlon officials also knew Ramlow had a low GPA
and a poor attendance record, Executive Director Les Martisko said.
But because the national organization does not require students to
maintain a minimum GPA or attend classes, he said there is little he
can do about the situation. "We're not changing the outcome," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Such explanations did not sit well with educators in Ventura
County, who maintain that the debacle is sending the wrong message to
kids who are involved in "aca-deca."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unethical, and it goes against everything education in this
country is supposed to stand for," Jones said. "It's saying if you
can win, it doesn't matter how much you break the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Gore, who runs the Ventura County decathlon out of the
superintendent of schools office, said Wisconsin and national
decathlon officials should investigate the matter and, if it is
determined that Ramlow was not eligible, subtract his points from the
team's score.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not reflect well on other academic decathletes or the
program in general," Gore said. "The high school had a responsibility
to hold a higher standard."</TE>
<TE>   Other officials in California had different opinions. Marvin Cobb,
executive director of the California Academic Decathlon, said he
remains happy with his state's performance in the U.S. meet and will
not appeal the results. "I think this is much ado about nothing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Decathlon teams have nine members, three with A averages, three
with B and three with C averages or less. Ramlow, clearly in the
latter group, nevertheless beat out all others in total points at the
event.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin youth said that he believes the controversy lies
with the district's vague policy and that the team's achievement
should not be questioned.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so sad people don't think we earned this, when we worked
so hard," the teenager said.</TE>
<TE>   "Decathlon has made me a better person. Why anyone would want to
put a bad light on that, I don't know."</TE>

said. But because the national organization does not require students
to maintain a minimum GPA or attend classes, he said there is little
he can do about the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the points of the competition is to get low-achieving
students involved," Martisko said, adding that Waukesha's win--making
it the first team from a state other than Texas or California to take
the national title in the event's 21-year history--has "been a really
positive thing" for the small school.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not changing the outcome," he said. "This team is the

<TE>   Such explanations did not sit well with educators in Ventura

<TE>   The confusion in Wisconsin is the latest conflict to arise from
this year's national battle of the brains.</TE>

locked in a protracted court battle to determine which high school

<HD>For Daring Pilots, Sky's the Limit</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Jaw-dropping aerobatic displays thrill thousands
at the Point Mugu Air Show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual Point Mugu Air show opened with a roar Friday with more
than 4,000 people turning out to witness displays of aerobatics so
startling that many gasped and shut their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Supersonic jets blasted just 200 feet overhead while acrobatic
biplanes twirled like ballerinas in the blue skies.</LD>
<LD>   People jumped, ears were plugged and some said their bones
actually rattled.</LD>
<TE>   The star attractions were the Thunderbirds, the famed Air Force
flying team outfitted in red, white and blue F-16 fighter jets. But
there were also flights of F-14, F-15 and F-18 fighter-bombers. The
supersecret, radar-eluding Stealth fighter also made an appearance,
zipping overhead with its distinct black wedge shape framed against
the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, aircraft were parked and opened for the public to
explore. People meandered around the cargo bay of a C-130 transport
plane. Others examined vintage aircraft and peered into the windows
of an aging Soviet MiG fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Security was tighter this year because of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the war in Afghanistan. Military personnel searched bags
at the entrance and forbade the use of coolers inside the air show.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan war apparently boosted public interest in military
hardware, according to some who manned booths around the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting a lot more questions than last year about what we
do," said Lt. Chan Barry, a naval flight officer who was standing
beside an E2C Hawkeye aircraft, which directs planes to their targets
and also picks up enemy radio traffic. "Everyone is asking if I was
in Afghanistan. More people are saying they appreciate what we do."</TE>
<TE>   At a booth with inert mortar rounds, missiles and land mines, the
Soviet-made RPG or rocket-propelled grenade-launcher was the clear
favorite. The weapon, a favorite among guerrilla armies worldwide,
was widely seen toted by Afghan militiamen on news broadcasts at the
height of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very interested in ordnance this year," said Lt. Eric
Bray, who runs the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit at Point Mugu.
"They all want to see the RPG. They know it because they see it on TV
and in the movies."</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd awaited the Thunderbirds, there were wild aerobatic
fliers such as John Nash and Sean Tucker in his red high-performance
biplane.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker had the crowd on its feet and gasping as he seemed to push
his small plane to the limit. He flew straight up, then dove straight
for the runway before pulling up at the last second. At one point
Tucker flew upside-down just 20 feet above the runway at speeds of
230 mph.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Nash would fly his plane in ever-tightening
corkscrew patterns and then let the plane drop nearly back to earth
before pulling up.</TE>
<TE>   About 3:30 p.m. the Thunderbird pilots started their engines and
took the aircraft to the edge of the runway. With martial music
blaring from speakers, they sped down the runway and banked sharply
just after taking off.</TE>
<TE>   The ground shook as they screamed past, sometimes flying just 18
inches apart at supersonic speed.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the planes formed a diamond formation and another sped
through the center. Two planes zoomed toward each other at 1,200 mph,
turning at seemingly the last second to avoid collision. Planes flew
200 feet above the runway before shooting three miles straight up
into the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras inside the cockpits showed the pilot as he maneuvered,
broadcasting the image up on a giant screen on the side of the
runway.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration continued for about 45 minutes, making up for
last year when fog grounded the Thunderbirds and disappointed the
hundreds of people who came to see them.</TE>
<TE>   Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just fantastic," said Beckie Fender, 48, of Newbury
Park. "It awakens all of your senses. Your whole body tingles when
they go by."</TE>
<TE>   Children who were part of the Make a Wish Foundation got ringside
seats after being invited by the Thunderbird team.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved all the planes doing tricks," said 7-year-old Hailey
Johnson of Ventura, who is battling cancer. "I especially liked the
two that flew off on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Dani Anderson, 15, who has muscular dystrophy, watched in awe as
four jets stacked like a sandwich blew past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how they can get in so close to each other," the
Camarillo girl said.</TE>
<TE>   When the show was over, the planes landed and the six pilots
climbed out. They were greeted by raucous applause.</TE>
<TE>   "With everything that happened in September you watch this with a
sense of pride," said Alesha Silva, 28, of Goleta. "You really
appreciate what they do."</TE>
<TE>   The show, which includes free admission and parking, continues
today and Sunday, with gates opening at 8 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Responds to Sex Abuse Scandal</HD>
<DH>Catholics: Tod D. Brown of Orange diocese says church will
have to give laity more influence, among other reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh from a two-day meeting with 20 Roman Catholic leaders in Los
Angeles, Tod D. Brown, bishop of Orange, said Friday it's clear that
bishops and priests will have to yield some authority to church
members as a result of the church's unfolding sex scandal.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the Catholic Church in our country has been too
clerical," said Brown, a member of the Vatican's Curia, an elite
group of cardinals and bishops whose members perform duties in the
pope's name and with his authority.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to take seriously" the reforms of the Second Vatican
Council, a modernizing effort of the 1960s, and get the laity
involved at all levels--"as much as we can do that theologically," he
added.</LD>
<TE>   Placing lay Catholics in roles of influence can produce watchdogs
within the church and also bring in different perspectives, loosening
the powerful grip that each bishop has on his diocese. Each of the
church's 195 U.S. dioceses operates independently, with its bishop
reporting to the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Some prelates already have proposed such reforms. On Thursday,
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony announced an expanded role of laity in the
Los Angeles Archdiocese, including using victims of molestation to
review sexual abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's comments came after a conference of California and Nevada
prelates who were preparing for the highly anticipated national
bishops' conference in June. It will be the first time the bishops
have gathered since news media revelations in Boston early this year
unveiled case after case in which church officials had allowed
priests accused of molestation to remain on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the bishops' meeting was dominated by discussions of
the scandal. He said the bishops generally agree on the basics of an
effective sexual abuse policy for clergy, similar to the strict,
revamped guidelines put into place recently by the Los Angeles and
Orange dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   The changes include a hot-line number, an advocate for victims,
and outreach programs to educate church members and their children
about how to recognize inappropriate behavior by priests.</TE>
<TE>   However, some prelates still feel uncomfortable dismissing an
otherwise good priest who has a single molestation in his distant
past, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some bishops having trouble with a 'zero-tolerance'
approach," he said. "They're struggling with that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Time 'When True Healing Can Begin'</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the issue of whether a priest with a past history of
sexual abuse should remain in the ministry will be debated vigorously
at the national conference in June, a time "when true healing can
begin."</TE>
<TE>   He said efforts to give the laity more authority will generate
lively discussions on sensitive issues that the Vatican would prefer
not be discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to be listening to our people clearly, we're going
to listen to what they have to say, whether we want to hear it or
not," Brown said. "So if they are concerned about celibacy [for
example], we're going to have to listen to that."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Pope John Paul II unexpectedly summoned the
eight U.S. cardinals--along with two American bishops--to the Vatican
next week to talk about the abuse controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Vatican wants to become better apprised of the situation,"
Brown said. "They are saying, 'Tell us more about it, what can be
done, and how can we help you?' That's how I see it."</TE>
<TE>   Brown declined to comment on whether he or his fellow bishops
think it would help the healing process if Cardinal Bernard Law of
Boston resigned after it was revealed that he knew priests accused of
sexual abuse were being moved from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   But in general, "I would say that if a bishop made a serious
mistake, he needs to take responsibility for that," Brown said. "When
a bishop comes to a point that he understands he cannot restore
credibility to himself and his ministry," he should resign.</TE>
<TE>   So far, "there's no light yet at the end of the tunnel" as far as
the sex scandal is concerned, Brown said, adding that the controversy
will continue as long as legitimate victims of abuse keep coming
forward.</TE>
<TE>   There was a "certain sadness" among bishops Brown met with, "but
there was a lot of strength gained by coming together and sharing our
concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said some of the Catholic Church's greatest strides have
been instigated by major scandals, and there are blessings to be
found amid ongoing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great cleansing," he said. "We'll come out of this a
humbler, holier, more dedicated church."</TE>

<HD>Detectives Search Blake's Home, 2 Other Locations</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police seize papers, computers and weapons. Actor is
being held without bail in a segregated jail ward.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Robert Blake in custody in the county jail's hospital ward, Los
Angeles police detectives searched the actor's Hidden Hills home and
two other places Friday for additional evidence to prove that he
killed his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's lawyer said authorities also sought to bolster their case
by offering a deal to the actor's bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, who,
like Blake, was arrested Thursday. But attorney Harland W. Braun said
no deal was struck. Police denied that any deal had been offered.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, and Caldwell, 46, are suspects in the death last May of
Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, who was shot in the head near a
Studio City restaurant where she and Blake had just eaten.</LD>
<TE>   The actor, who has maintained his innocence, is accused of
shooting Bakley with a World War II-vintage weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, booked on suspicion of murder, is being held without bail
in a segregated area on the hospital floor of the Men's Central Jail
in downtown Los Angeles, the same ward that once housed O.J. Simpson,
among other high-profile inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials stressed that Blake, best known as the
detective in the 1970s television series "Baretta," is being held
there because there was not enough room in segregated housing in
other areas of the jail. They added that he was not suffering from
any medical condition.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of his notoriety, to put him in the regular population,
it would put him in danger," said Sheriff's Lt. Carl Deeley.</TE>
<TE>   In sweeps of Blake's home in Hidden Hills and Caldwell's apartment
in Burbank, homicide detectives seized papers, computers and weapons,
said Capt. Jim Tatreau of the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on search warrants issued Thursday, detectives also
examined a third location, identified only as somewhere in "the
southern part of the state," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference at the LAPD's headquarters, Tatreau said
detectives plan to present the case against Blake and Caldwell to the
Los Angeles County district attorney's office early Monday. If
prosecutors file charges, both men are expected to be arraigned that
morning in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Additional Arrests Expected</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau also said detectives have questioned two people Blake
allegedly solicited to murder his wife but don't anticipate making
any additional arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "They've certainly been interviewed and provided statements,"
Tatreau said of the two people.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question about whether the two people rejected
Blake's alleged offer to kill his wife, Tatreau said, "No one has
offered that they turned it down and no one has confirmed anything
about their role or what they did."</TE>
<TE>   That was typical of the tenor of the news conference, in which
little new information was disclosed about the nearly year-old case.
Investigators traveled to more than 20 states, interviewed more than
150 witnesses and collected about 900 items of evidence, authorities
said. No other LAPD murder investigation has required so much travel,
Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   The case was especially complex because Bakley had a checkered
past and, according to Braun, many potential enemies. She had a
criminal record and had been running a mail-order dating service in
which she allegedly sent letters, videotapes and nude photographs to
men in exchange for cash, plane and bus tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Blake married her in November 2000, five months after she gave
birth to a daughter, Rose. Tests had shown Blake to be the father.
The girl has remained with Blake and his adult daughter, Delinah,
since Bakley's death.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Blake told them that Bakley was shot in the couple's
car when he left her alone briefly to retrieve a gun, which he is
licensed to carry, from the restaurant where they had been eating.
Police said Thursday that he killed her to escape their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the charges expected to be filed Monday will likely be similar
to what Police Chief Bernard C. Parks announced Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he expected that Blake would face one count of murder
with a special allegation of lying in wait, which means he could face
the death penalty, and two counts of solicitation, and that Caldwell
would face one count of conspiracy to commit murder.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the way the arrests were carried out suggested there
might be friction between the two agencies over handling of the case.</TE>
<TE>   He said he thought police "jumped the gun" by not waiting to
arrest Blake until a criminal complaint or indictment was filed.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to me as if Parks is trying to jam this down [Dist.
Atty. Steve] Cooley's throat," Braun said. "I think it's a very weird
situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Case 'Came Together' After Nearly a Year</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons said the district attorney's office did not file a
criminal complaint before the arrest because the case had not been
formally presented to prosecutors. "There is a ballet, if you will,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working with them for 11 months," she added. "Finally
it all came together a few days ago."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons declined to comment on Braun's claim that authorities had
offered a deal to Caldwell, who police said was believed to have been
out of town the night Bakley was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said police "offered to let him go last night if he would
give them information that would have hurt Robert, but he didn't have
any."</TE>
<TE>   Bakley's family, which has expressed relief over the arrests,
announced plans Friday to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Blake
and Caldwell in the next two weeks. The lawsuit must be filed in Los
Angeles County Superior Court by May 4, the one-year anniversary of
Bakley's death.</TE>
<TE>   "The family is pleased they are making a step toward closure and
resolution," said Bakley family attorney Cary Goldstein. "They are
still feeling the pain of the murder."</TE>
<TE>   He said child custody is not an issue at this time. Rose is living
with Blake's adult daughter. The Bakley family may eventually seek
visitation rights.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Budget Avoids Major Spending Cuts</HD>
<DH>Finances: The recent recovery and an increase in DWP funds
fatten the mayor's $4.81-billion, status-quo plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Improvement in the local economy combined with an increase in revenue
from the Department of Water and Power has allowed Los Angeles to
avoid significant budget cutbacks in the spending plan presented
Friday by Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's budget team took advantage of the area's robust real estate
market to help close the budget gap, while also turning to the DWP
for a bigger share of the municipal utility's receipts.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, a shortfall that many had predicted would be the
largest in a decade instead shrank significantly, allowing the
government to avoid layoffs and major service cutbacks.</LD>
<TE>   The 2002-2003 budget, which the mayor unveiled Friday, contains
small trims to the city bureaucracy while slightly increasing police,
fire and other basic services.</TE>
<TE>   The total city budget is $4.81 billion, down a fraction from last
year, and for the most part maintains the status quo, including a
citywide hiring freeze.</TE>
<TE>   "The slowing economy and the effect of the [Sept. 11] attacks made
this one of the most difficult budgets in years," Hahn said during a
morning news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council now begins its review of the proposed budget,
which must be returned to the mayor for approval by June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor's budget did a good job of preserving the level
of city services we funded last year," said City Councilman Nick
Pacheco, head of the Budget Committee. "I'm sure there's a bunch of
small issues that we're going to have to deal with, but in terms of
the big picture, I think all of our hard work this year with savings
paid off."</TE>
<TE>   In January, city officials warned that Los Angeles could be facing
a $250-million budget shortfall and predicted that all but basic
public safety services could face cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few months, the prognosis of next year's revenues
perked up considerably, powered by a strong local real estate market.
Now, officials believe that the city's revenues will grow by a modest
3% next year, and perhaps more.</TE>
<TE>   "All the local, state and national economists are saying we're
well on our way to recovery," said William Fujioka, the city's
administrative officer. "But we still need to proceed carefully."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's office persuaded the DWP to increase its contribution
to the city coffers from 5% of power sales to 7%, an increase of
about $46 million.</TE>
<TE>   The change brings the DWP in line with other public utilities,
many of which give a bigger share of their profits to local
municipalities. The move still must be approved by the DWP
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Given our financial strength and position in the market, we're in
a good position to absorb the cost," said Frank Salas, the DWP's
chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was also able to close the projected gap in the 2002-03
budget by pushing city departments to make $49 million in cuts in
this fiscal year and instituting a hiring freeze for all employees
except sworn police officers and firefighters, resulting in $15
million in savings.</TE>
<TE>   Those moves allow the city to roll over $64.9 million into the
reserve fund, just enough to meet the minimum standard of 2% of the
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm impressed with how the budget has been handled, in terms of
the deficits that everybody anticipated," said City Council President
Alex Padilla, praising the steps taken this year to save money.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the mayor's budget team had to make only $38 million
in cuts to balance the budget he presented Friday, trimming programs
that affect city employees rather than Los Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-nine positions throughout the city are being eliminated
through attrition. In addition, city departments have smaller budgets
for contractual services, printing and binding, travel, and City
Council liaisons.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not going to be a lot of traveling by departments to
conferences next year," Hahn said. "So they're going to have to have
somebody else go and take notes for them."</TE>
<TE>   With fewer resources, all but emergency maintenance on city
buildings will be postponed. New phones will not be installed. Bulk
mailings will be limited.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Butcher, head of one of the unions that represents city
workers, said she was pleased with the budget document.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very reasoned approach to getting through temporarily
tough times and not cutting anything that affects services," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of General Services, which assists the rest of the
city bureaucracy, took one of the largest cuts, losing about
$3million.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Mukri, general manager of the department, said he will be
working with other city officials to determine how to prioritize the
limited resources for maintenance and upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   Some departments received modest increases. The Los Angeles Police
Department is to get $34million more than this fiscal year, enough to
hire 360 officers and implement the second year of a federal consent
decree mandating changes in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has also proposed transferring 100 officers from
administrative positions in community affairs, the DARE program and
the ombudsman's office back to patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Because attrition is expected to continue, the hiring and
transfers will only slightly raise the number of police officers on
the street. The mayor said that if recruitment and hiring increase,
he will try to find money to hire more officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department is to receive an increase of $19 million,
money that will replace obsolete equipment and hire 24 more
paramedics and 48 more firefighters. The mayor has also proposed
establishing a new hazardous-materials squad in the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss, who has been lobbying for more
spending to defend the city against terrorism, said he was pleased
with the new squad.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very good to see the mayor has taken the threat seriously
and responded," said Weiss, who added that he will try to find money
to pay for additional measures during the budget process.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's budget also includes more money for new parks,
neighborhood councils and neighborhood prosecutors, who work with the
LAPD and community groups to tackle crime.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the council, about 260 miles of streets will be
resurfaced and 78 miles of sidewalks will be repaired--the same
amount as last year. More than 123,000 trees will be trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is frustrating in my first year in office, my first budget,
I'm actually looking at spending less money in the city than more,"
Hahn said. "But we looked for ways to make cuts really not visible to
the public."</TE>

<HD>Drivers to Vote on Bus Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: Negotiators for union urge members to reject latest
proposal by Los Angeles Unified's transit contractor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Striking school bus drivers said Friday they will vote this weekend
on whether to continue their 17-day walkout or accept the latest
proposal from the Los Angeles Unified School District's
transportation contractor, Laidlaw Education Services.</LD>
<LD>   Strikers voted down a previous offer last week, and the
negotiating team for Teamsters Union Local 572 is urging a rejection
of the latest offer too. Details on the timing and location for the
voting had not been settled Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Teamsters spokesman Don Owens said Laidlaw's latest offer is
nearly the same as the one rejected last week. The biggest sticking
point is the health-care plan, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "If the members vote against this, we stay on strike," Owens said.
"At that point it can be called a strike of attrition."</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw executives could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The company's health-benefits package offers coverage only after a
year of employment.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders said they want another health plan used by many
other Teamsters locals that would offer coverage sooner and reduce
the company's costs by 20% for each employee enrolled in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to union officials, Laidlaw executives argued that
such a proposal would attract more workers than now buy into the
coverage, raising the company's overall costs.</TE>
<TE>   The union first demanded wage and benefits parity with drivers
employed directly by the school district. L.A. Unified drivers make
$13 to $24 an hour, while Laidlaw drivers earn $8 to $15 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In the package rejected by drivers last week, Laidlaw offered an
average annual raise of 6.3% over three years, but little in enhanced
benefits. Details of the current offer could not be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   During the strike, L.A. Unified has used smaller bus contractors
and its own in-house fleet and drivers as substitutes on Laidlaw
routes.</TE>
<TE>   But the walkout continues to cause delays averaging nearly an hour
for 20,000 affected students. Athletic events and field trips also
have been curtailed because of bus shortages.</TE>

<HD>Residents to Take a Look Back at Old Canoga Park</HD>
<DH>Memories: Historical society puts mementos on display as
the city formerly known as Owensmouth turns 90.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean and Jim Jauck are not from founding families, but they will be
at the Canoga Park Women's Club on Sunday when the community
celebrates its 90th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-nine-year-old Jean Jauck is a past and future president of
the Canoga-Owensmouth Historical Society. Jim Jauck, 70, is director
of the community's modest history museum, housed in former Los
Angeles City Fire Station No.72.</LD>
<LD>   A retired engineer, Jim Jauck greets visitors who straggle in on
the second and fourth Sunday of the month, when the museum is open to
the public.</LD>
<TE>   He points out such local treasures as the so-called Owensmouth
baby, a little plaster-of-Paris plaque featuring a stork carrying an
infant from its beak.</TE>
<TE>   In 1912, the Janns Investment Co. gave the plaques as mementoes to
anyone who bought a lot in its new community, called Owensmouth.
Owensmouth was then the "baby" community in the San Fernando
Valley--following the creation of Van Nuys and Marian, later renamed
Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the plaques are known to exist. Local history is made
of such modest artifacts, and the passion of people like the Jaucks.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 100 active members in the historical society, all
of whom cherish such small treasures as the artifacts in the museum
related to Clara Rooksby.</TE>
<TE>   Miss Clara Rooksby, as the Jaucks always call her, was one of
three original teachers at Owensmouth High School, later Canoga Park
High School. The community changed its name in 1931 to Canoga Park.
She also founded the local library.</TE>
<TE>   Rooksby died in 1967, at 103, and the museum now has her Victrola,
which visiting children love to see wound up and hear played.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Jaucks, who live in West Hills, children are also
intrigued by the mustache cup and apple corer on display.</TE>
<TE>   When Jean Jauck is tending the museum, she often points to a
compact black machine on display and asks young visitors if they know
what it is. They rarely do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a typewriter," she tells them. "They're used to computers,
and a typewriter is a thing of the past."</TE>
<TE>   A white egg in one of the cases also fascinates visitors. It is a
reminder of the Charles Weeks Poultry Colony, an experiment begun in
1922 by a 50-year-old philosopher and entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks urged families to find happiness and economic salvation by
plunking down $1,500 for a one-acre plot in what residents continue
to call Winnetka. They could live on the land and raise chickens on
it, then sell their eggs--newly fashionable white eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people in our organization who lived in Weeks Colony,"
Jean Jauck said.</TE>
<TE>   The Canoga Park Women's Club founded the museum in 1987, to mark
the community's 75th birthday. Jean Jauck gives the group much of the
credit for documenting the community's past.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, as citizens, we tend to neglect our heritage," she said.
"I think it's important to remember your heritage and your roots.
Otherwise, [where you live] is just a place."</TE>
<TE>   Historian and "Owensmouth baby" Catherine Mulholland will speak
Sunday at the Women's Club at 7401 Jordan Ave. between 2 and 4 p.m. A
special invitation to the event, which is open to the public, has
been extended to members of the founding families of Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland Family Had Part in Area's History</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland, whose books include "William Mulholland and the Rise
of Los Angeles," is the granddaughter of the L.A. water czar.</TE>
<TE>   "The town was 11 years old when I was born," said Mulholland, 79,
whose birth was announced in the Owensmouth Gazette.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch owned by her father, Perry Mulholland, and mother, Addie
Haas Mulholland, is now the site of a Northridge Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my mother, who was one of the original settlers, 'You
know, I think I'd like to write something about the early days of
Owensmouth,'" Mulholland recalled. "And she said, 'How in the world
are you going to make that interesting?'"</TE>
<TE>   Her mother's remark, Mulholland said, "does capture an attitude
toward history that's shared by many people."</TE>
<TE>   As people grow older, Mulholland found, they tend to become more
interested in the past of their own community: "When you're young,
you're just too busy creating your own life to care."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland said that her mother's family moved to Owensmouth from
Calabasas, then a rural community, because Owensmouth promised better
schools and transportation (a trolley that once traversed the San
Fernando Valley was already in the works).</TE>
<TE>   "Civilization was coming and the amenities that civilization could
provide--amenities that Calabasas didn't have," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Historical societies may be silly at times, Mulholland said, but
they are also invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the local historical societies in Southern California,
there would be a real vacuum in our history," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The world I knew is gone. The only way you can capture even a
fragment of it, is through books, movies and historical societies."</TE>

<HD>Official Adds to Intrigue in Carson</HD>
<DH>Probe: Councilman who changed his vote on a controversial
trash-hauling contract was secretly cooperating with FBI, his lawyer
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Carson councilman was secretly cooperating with the FBI when he
cast the deciding vote to approve a controversial trash-hauling
contract, then later cast the deciding vote this week to rescind it,
his lawyer said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "He didn't flip-flop," attorney Jose Y. Lauchengco Jr. said of his
client, Councilman Manuel Ontal.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been a culture of corruption in that city in the
awarding of contracts. Manny Ontal got fed up with it and he wanted
to put a stop to it, and he did."</LD>
<TE>   Lauchengco refused to say whether Ontal approached the FBI. "Let's
put it this way," he said. "My client took the initiative."</TE>
<TE>   In February, Ontal voted with Mayor Daryl Sweeney and Councilwoman
Raunda Frank to approve an exclusive, multimillion-dollar commercial
waste hauling contract with Browning Ferris Industries.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was controversial. BFI eventually said at a public
council meeting that it had hired Sweeney's personal lawyer, who was
also employed as an attorney for the city.</TE>
<TE>   A BFI executive told the City Council that the lawyer, Robert
Pryce, had faxed secret bid amounts submitted by a BFI competitor to
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Even after learning that BFI had received the fax, the council
majority allowed the firm to lower its bid.</TE>
<TE>   BFI's competitor, Waste Management Inc., told The Times that it
had earlier passed up a chance to hire Pryce after Sweeney
recommended him.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management said it declined after Pryce asked for $1 million
for help in delivering a council majority.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Ontal had originally voted for the contract, Lauchengco
said: "The only intelligent answer to that is that the natural course
of events must be permitted to take place."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he was then asked, a crime must be allowed to be
committed if it is to be prosecuted?</TE>
<TE>   "Right," the lawyer responded.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been charged with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, FBI agents searched the residences of Sweeney and
Frank and the Gardena office of BFI.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials have refused to say what they were looking
for, noting that warrants authorizing the searches have been sealed
by court order.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney has declined through an attorney to be interviewed. Frank
and Pryce have not responded to repeated requests for interviews.
Messages left Friday for Ontal on his voice mail were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   A BFI spokesman has declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ontal stunned political watchers in the city of 90,000 on
Wednesday by switching sides in the contract debate. He voted with
council members Kay Calas and Jim Dear to overturn the BFI contract.</TE>
<TE>   Lauchengco suggested that Ontal changed his vote to right a wrong.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Ontal announced his intention to resign effective
in June.</TE>
<TE>   He told the packed council chambers that residents deserve a
decision-making process that is "honest and fair."</TE>
<TE>   Ontal's lawyer said Friday that his client is not facing arrest.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested, but would not confirm, that FBI agents are
protecting Ontal, acknowledging that four FBI agents accompanied
Ontal when he left the meeting after announcing his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer also said FBI agents are investigating other government
actions in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, The Times reported that another firm seeking to do
business in Carson, Rand Pearlman Ventures, said Sweeney also had
strongly urged it to hire Pryce as a lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Richard Rand said Pryce asked him, among other things,
for a 10% equity stake in a planned $300-million shopping center to
be anchored by Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   The developer refused, and lost the business opportunity to a
competitor.</TE>

<HD>Calm Amid Storm Known as Compton</HD>
<DH>Tradition: 'First Church' marks its 134th anniversary with
hopes of rekindling its stature in the community.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in the cushiony living room of her home, Julliett Tucker
remembers Compton.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that she ever left the city, mind you. In fact, her
ranch-style house is in an area she and her neighbors once called the
Hollywood of Compton.</LD>
<LD>   What the 69-year-old grandmother remembers is a Compton of four
decades ago, a Compton that people were fighting to move into, not
escape. A Compton whose collective face was nothing like hers, but
welcomed her and her family warmly when they bought their house in
the early 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   It's a town that for Tucker is wholly intertwined with the First
United Methodist Church of Compton, which celebrates its 134th
anniversary this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In one of Southern California's most tumultuous cities, the
primarily black church of 300 is a reminder of the aspirations of the
civil-rights era that seem to have eluded Compton in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Odis Fentry said the celebration, to be marked with a
gospel concert tonight and a special sermon Sunday, aims to rekindle
the church's historical stature in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Both the city and the church were founded in 1867 by a group of
Methodist settlers from Stockton. The city was incorporated that
year, and the church was formally organized a year later. One of its
original trustees was the city's namesake, Griffith Dickenson
Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Compton was primarily white when residential segregation began to
fade in the 1950s in Southern California. Blacks seeking better
housing moved in, some attracted to First Church, as it was known,
because there was "structure to the worship," said Julliett Tucker's
husband, Cleo. "It wasn't all wild and crazy like some other churches
we went to."</TE>
<TE>   Maxcy Filer, a 71-year-old church member and onetime Compton city
councilman, said blacks also joined First Church because there
weren't any African Methodist Episcopal churches in the area.
"Methodist was Methodist to us."</TE>
<TE>   First Church, which was in downtown Compton, became one of the
city's earliest integrated institutions. The Filers, who arrived in
the mid-1950s, were one of two black families in the neighborhood and
at the church, Filer said.</TE>
<TE>   The church's pastor, the Rev. Earl Isbell, not only accepted the
change but encouraged it, said Filer, who served as president of the
Compton NAACP for five years, beginning in 1960. "He was for it. Some
of the whites didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   During Sunday services, the black families would sit together,
Filer recalled. But Isbell forced integration, sometimes beginning
his sermon by asking the Filers or one of the other black families to
sit in a section of the church occupied by whites.</TE>
<TE>   White flight followed in Compton and other integrating communities
such as the Crenshaw District. Filer's son, Compton Municipal Court
Commissioner Kelvin Filer, said he doesn't remember the exodus. "What
I remember is seeing more people like me showing up," said Filer.
"After a while, there were a lot of us there. We used to all go to
church together, and hang out in the neighborhood together."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Goff remembers those days too. She moved into the
neighborhood the same year as the Filers. Today, the 69-year-old
grandmother, who has since moved to Lakewood, is among the handful of
whites who remain with First Church.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the one place that I wanted to go," said Goff.
"There are a lot of churches on the way. But this one ... I just feel
at home there."</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, a contingent of the church's white members left to form
Temple Methodist Church. Goff didn't see any reason to leave. For
her, First Church has always been about "the spiritual growth and
fellowship," she said. "I've met so many good people here."</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Julliett Tucker and her family left the west
side of Compton and bought a house on the primarily white east side
of the city on Poinsettia Street. They joined Temple Methodist, which
was still largely white. Julliett Tucker said she didn't mind the
differences in race. She had been brought up in the Methodist Church,
she said, and most of her life had attended services with mixed
congregations.</TE>
<TE>   Cleo Tucker, who worked in a Long Beach shipyard at the time, said
he was only interested in the message being preached by the church's
pastor, the Rev. Bill Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   The first week in their new home, the Tuckers were called on by
Henderson, who was white.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Baptist," Cleo Tucker told Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's all right," the pastor said. "I hear Baptists make
the best Methodists."</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, the city of Compton purchased First Methodist Church's
property downtown, and the church merged with Temple Methodist to
form First United Methodist Church. Cleo Tucker, who became the first
black man to join Temple Methodist, said the merger resulted in the
departure of most of the remaining white congregants--and numerous
black families too.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them [blacks] resented the Temple church because they
understood why it was there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker and his family stuck it out. So did the Filers, the Goffs
and several dozen others.</TE>
<TE>   The current pastor, 72-year-old Fentry, has had a 42-year
on-and-off relationship with the church.</TE>
<TE>   Fentry had been an associate pastor in the 1960s, the first
African American to hold the post at the church, and worked with
Isbell to bring new black families into the congregation. He left in
the mid-1980s, when he was assigned to churches in Gardena and Los
Angeles, then became superintendent of the Los Angeles district. He
quit that position in 2000 at 70, the denomination's customary age of
retirement, but returned to First United Methodist in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   He found the church property a mess. The parking lot needed to be
repaved, and the building was literally falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   Fentry obtained a $10,000 grant from the city to repair and
resurface the parking lot. He also replaced 30 missing and broken
pieces of stained glass in the sanctuary and fellowship hall.</TE>
<TE>   Once he was done with the physical repairs, Fentry started on the
church's spirituality. In a decade, the congregation had gone through
five pastors.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to engage his congregants, Fentry introduced
anointing services, something traditionally associated with Eastern
Orthodox or Roman Catholic churches. He prayed more fervently with
his members. When an older member of the congregation took ill,
Fentry laid his hands on her shoulder and prayed for her in front of
the entire congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the Methodist Church don't usually react well to stuff
like that," said Fentry of the mostly middle-class congregation.
"These are things you usually see in other churches, but the
congregation needed it."</TE>

<HD>Man Sues Airline Over Wife's Disappearance</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The husband of an Alzheimer's patient who disappeared at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport on Dec. 5 has filed a $10-million lawsuit
charging that American Airlines or its agents lost her.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney representing Joe Dabney, 63, filed the lawsuit in
Bakersfield, where he and Margie Dabney lived at the time of her
disappearance. It accuses the airline of gross negligence, breach of
contract and incompetence.</LD>
<LD>   The Dabneys were bound for LAX from Indianapolis and had a plane
change at the Texas airport. Margie Dabney, 70, vanished in the
minutes after she and her husband left one gate headed for another in
the terminal. She remains missing.</LD>
<TE>   American Airlines spokesman Marty Heires said Friday that "we
don't normally comment on lawsuits," but noted the efforts the
airline had made to help the family. Those included paying many of
the expenses of Candace Price of Indiana, who has spent weeks in
Texas searching for her mother.</TE>
<TE>   The airline has said that the attendant assigned to escort the
Dabneys to their gate may have mistakenly thought he was to help only
Joe Dabney, who must use a wheelchair. The airline says the attendant
did not know that the wife suffered from Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   The national Alzheimer's Assn. says that 4 million Americans
suffer the memory-impairing disease, and that about half of the
afflicted wander at some point.</TE>

<HD>High School Student From Germany Appeals UC Davis
Acceptance Foul-Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yuta Sakane, a high school senior at a German-American school in
Berlin, really, really wants to attend UC Davis.</LD>
<LD>   His aim has been to go to a college with top-notch programs in
each of his two very different passions--agricultural science and
art--and the Northern California school seemed like the perfect
answer.</LD>
<LD>   So Sakane was thrilled late last month when he received a letter
from the campus saying he was accepted for next year's freshman
class. He was so sure UC Davis was the right place that he
immediately fired off letters to all four of the other schools that
accepted him to decline their offers.</LD>
<TE>   And then came the bad news: Sakane received a follow-up letter
from UC Davis last week explaining that he was one of 105 students
rejected by UC Davis who, because of a clerical error, was sent a
letter of acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   Sakane has lodged an appeal with UC Davis--the only one that
university officials know of thus far. Meanwhile, his guidance
counselor is both baffled and angry over what he said is the school's
insensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you this, in the circles I travel in, when we make a
mistake of that magnitude ... we just go ahead and honor what we'd
said we were going to do," said Herb Blount, head of the guidance
department at the John F. Kennedy School in Berlin, the international
school that Sakane attends.</TE>
<TE>   UC Davis officials declined to discuss the specifics of Sakane's
case with a reporter, saying only that none of the 105 students
involved in the foul-up met the university's "selection criteria."</TE>
<TE>   Blount explained that it isn't as if Sakane, who speaks Japanese,
English and German, is an academic slacker. His school requires only
28 hours of classes for seniors, but he is taking 42.</TE>
<TE>   Sakane, a Japanese national whose father works for a restaurant
company in Germany, said he mainly is upset for his parents, who were
eager for their son to attend the school.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents, they haven't done anything wrong," said Sakane, 18.
"I can be depressed, but I don't want to see other people depressed."</TE>
<TE>   Sakane admits his grade point average, at 3.73, is good but not
stellar. Likewise, his SATs totaled 1150 out of a possible 1600. That
included an impressive 700 out of 800 in math, but a far less
impressive 450 in verbal. This week, Blount spoke with Gary Tudor, UC
Davis' director of undergraduate admissions, on Sakane's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The university administrator offered little reason for optimism.
Tudor said in an interview that the median combined SAT score of the
students accepted for the freshman class was 1230, and the median
grade point average was 3.86.</TE>
<TE>   Tudor said he had not yet reviewed Sakane's appeal, but added that
"very few appeals are granted at this late date."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Sakane said, he still has another option, Penn State,
one of the schools where he previously sent a "decline" letter. The
school agreed to keep a space open for him.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Admits Many Violations, Loses License</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Obstetrician concedes he put patients in danger.
He says his big fear is embarrassing his wife, a Claremont
councilwoman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIPTON BLISH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Claremont obstetrician-gynecologist on probation and without
medical malpractice insurance has been stripped of his license after
he acknowledged to the Medical Board of California that he misled
patients, endangered their lives and attempted a second-trimester
abortion.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Rosenthal, who began practicing in 1969, is married to
Claremont Councilwoman Karen Rosenthal, a former mayor.</LD>
<LD>   He admitted gross negligence and incompetence to the board in an
agreement signed Sept. 24, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview Friday he admitted to poor decisions that he made
in part because he was taking Prozac that he prescribed to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Also, he did not fight the charges because he could not afford to
pay high lawyer fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not in a position to defend myself," he said. "So I
basically rolled over."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal said he retired soon after the latest incidents.</TE>
<TE>   The board accused him of mishandling three abortions in 1999, when
he was running his own Upland-based Family Birthing Center serving
women with low-risk pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted to the board that he misled patients, lied to another
physician, failed to reveal an abnormal pap smear result, failed to
perform an ultrasound on a patient who had already delivered four
babies by caesarean section, and started an abortion procedure on a
patient in her second trimester.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Rosenthal was on probation for two other incidents,
one in 1986 and one in 1992. In the latter case, medical board
prosecutors said he gambled that a pregnancy would be without
incident and didn't tell his patient that he had lost his privileges
in San Antonio.</TE>

<HD>A Priest in the Camp of the Sexually Abused</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Former church insider, now a U.S. military
chaplain, is hailed as an unsung hero by victims' advocates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>COLLEEN BARRY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMSTEIN, Germany</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of alleged victims of clergy sex abuse might never have come
forward if not for a former Roman Catholic insider who is now a
military chaplain at Ramstein Air Base.</LD>
<LD>   Father Thomas Doyle was once a canon lawyer at the Vatican Embassy
in Washington and on the fast track to becoming a bishop. But soon
after the first major U.S. clergy scandal emerged in the 1980s, Doyle
says he saw a conflict between trying to protect the church and the
victims--and sided with the victims.</LD>
<LD>   Now he is one of the few priests committed to appearing in civil
court as an expert witness for alleged victims of abuse. He has
consulted with hundreds of alleged victims in the United States,
Canada, Ireland, Britain, New Zealand and Australia, and testified in
dozens of cases.</LD>
<TE>   Victims' advocates hail him as a long-unrecognized hero. In
public, church officials are gently critical of Doyle, though
sometimes there are private expressions of hostility.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, an American, insists that his goal has always been to help
the church become a better institution.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't outspoken because I wanted to be a maverick," he said in
an interview at his apartment in southwestern Germany. "I found out
the system didn't want to bear the truth. I was shocked."</TE>
<TE>   When clerical sex abuse of minors first became an issue, Doyle was
working at the Vatican Embassy, where he oversaw the promotions of
U.S. bishops. He was smart, ambitious and conservative--with master's
degrees in philosophy, political science, theology and canon law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Doyle was asked to prepare a response to a letter from
the vicar general of Louisiana informing the embassy that Father
Gilbert Gauthe was accused of sexually abusing five children.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, I was still trying to protect the institutional
church at the same time as the victims," Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal appeared containable at first. Gauthe's diocese was
negotiating settlements. But a week later, another letter arrived at
the embassy: One of the families had pulled out and was filing a
civil suit.</TE>
<TE>   The case became a watershed, marking the first time the U.S.
church had publicly confronted sex abuse of minors.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthe pleaded guilty to molesting 11 boys and admitted
victimizing dozens more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Protocol on Issue Not Formally Adopted</TE>
<TE>   Working with two other men--Father Michael Peterson, a
psychiatrist who has since died, and Gauthe attorney Ray
Mouton--Doyle drafted a protocol intended to help bishops deal with
abuse by clergy.</TE>
<TE>   But the 98-page manual describing a broad range of medical, legal,
insurance and pastoral issues was never formally adopted as the
authors hoped, despite initial backing from influential cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   With his career stalled, Doyle joined the U.S. Air Force in 1986
and turned his focus toward helping survivors of clergy sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mouton: "I really believed in what we were doing. He believed
in what we were doing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the church said, 'You go walk points for us and find
the enemy.' And we did; we found the enemy and radioed back, 'The
enemy is us.' And they called a strike in on us."</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said it is not true that the report was ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "The bishops did learn from him, and from other sources," and took
many actions then and later, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, the bishops adopted a set of advisory principles on
dealing with abuse by clergy and expect to address the issue again at
their June meeting in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of clerical abuse say innumerable cases never would have
been heard without Doyle.</TE>
<TE>   "There are victims numbering in the dozens, if not hundreds, who
would not have come forward if not for his patient listening and
steadfast support," said David Clohessy, who runs a Chicago-based
network for people abused by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Rugged and trim at 57, Doyle is comfortable with his everyday life
in the Air Force. He loves to fly airplanes, is a lifelong member of
the National Rifle Assn., and is more at ease in military garb than
in a Roman collar.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more integrity in the leadership of the military than in
the Roman Catholic Church," he said. "An officer does not walk past a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Doyle seems surprised that the latest American clergy scandal has
led to next week's meeting between the pope, Vatican officials and
U.S. cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike in previous cases, he said, both the offenders and the
superiors who protected them are now being held accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "I was involved in all the big cases," he said. "I saw the bishops
lie on the stand. I saw the evidence, clear as a bell. But they
survived. It's like a Teflon hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "This time it's different."</TE>

<HD>2 Men Held in Shooting Over Alleged Drug Deal in Lancaster</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men are suspected of shooting a couple in their Lancaster home
after what investigators believe was a disagreement over a drug deal,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Melvin Carter, 32, of Palmdale, and Randolph Hicks, 53, of
Lancaster, are scheduled to appear at Antelope Valley Municipal Court
for arraignment Tuesday on charges of attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives arrested Carter at a local restaurant. Hicks turned
himself in at the sheriff's station in Lancaster, said Deputy Sonia
Parra of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   The men allegedly shot Rose and Eugene Kato about 2 p.m. Thursday
after an argument that investigators say ''may have been precipitated
over a drug transaction,'' Parra said.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Kato, 45, was shot three times in the chest and was listed in
critical but stable condition at Antelope Valley Hospital in
Lancaster, a hospital spokesman said. Eugene Kato, 39, was shot once
in the chest and was stable.</TE>
<TE>   Carter and Hicks are being held in Lancaster jail on $1-million
bail each.</TE>

<HD>Carl Eifler, 95; Ran OSS Unit in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl F. Eifler, who commanded the first OSS covert operations unit
during World War II and was dubbed "the deadliest colonel" for his
daring exploits and planning of operations behind enemy lines, has
died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Eifler died April 8 of natural causes in a medical rehabilitation
center in Salinas, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Central Casting couldn't have supplied a more imposing figure than
the 6-foot, 2-inch, 240-pound, tough-as-nails Army colonel.</LD>
<TE>   Eifler, according to his biographer, devised top-secret plans
(that were later canceled) to assassinate Chinese leader Chiang
Kai-shek and to kidnap Adolf Hitler's top atomic scientist.</TE>
<TE>   He was, in a word, fearless.</TE>
<TE>   He thought nothing of grabbing a 10-foot king cobra by the tail
and slicing off its head. He'd often challenge his men to "hit me in
the stomach as hard as you can," and wouldn't even flinch.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just him," said Tom Moon of Orange, who served as an OSS
agent under Eifler in Burma and India and later wrote a biography of
him. "Somebody told me they watched him one night digging a bullet
out of his leg with a spoon handle."</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Strategic Services, which was under the direction of
Gen. William "Wild Bill" Donovan, was the precursor of the Central
Intelligence Agency.</TE>
<TE>   When Eifler became commander of OSS operations in the Far East in
mid-1942, he had 22 men under his command. His Special Unit
Detachment 101 ultimately included 800 Americans and as many as
10,000 natives.</TE>
<TE>   In Burma, Eifler trained Americans and locals in undercover and
covert operations, set up camps, built small airstrips in the jungle,
cut enemy supply lines, planned ambushes, and rescued downed American
and British fliers. "I broke every law of God and man, but I never
did anything for personal gain," he said at an Assn. of Former
Intelligence Officers convention in San Diego in 1983. "I was out to
win a war for my country, and you can't fight a lawful war.... I
think the CIA today has gotten a lot of bad publicity. Where do you
want them to get information? From churches?"</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles in 1906, Eifler dropped out of school in the
eighth grade. Yearning for adventure, he lied about his age and
joined the Army. But he was discharged a year later when the Army
discovered he was only 15.</TE>
<TE>   Back in California, he knocked around doing carpentry and other
odd jobs before first joining the Los Angeles and later the Newport
Beach police departments. He later joined the U.S. Customs Service
and once uncovered a Japanese spy ring in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Eifler, who had joined the Army reserves around 1930, went on
active duty in early 1941 and was an infantry officer stationed in
Hawaii when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   He was put in command of a detention camp on Sand Island in
Honolulu, but a month later was ordered to report to the Coordinator
of Information in Washington, D.C. That agency later became the OSS.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Joseph W. Stillwell Jr., who had been friends with Eifler
when he was in the reserves in San Diego, was now the Far East
theater commander, and he requested that Eifler head up a covert
operations unit.</TE>
<TE>   Eifler, who recruited the top men from various military units in
the Far East, ultimately selected 20 men for the unit.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1942, Eifler and his men headed to Burma. For the next two
years, Eifler operated on direct orders from Washington in the
China-Burma-India theater of operations.</TE>
<TE>   According to Moon, Eifler tapped prostitutes for gathering
information and poisoning Japanese officers.</TE>
<TE>   Eifler lived a charmed life during most of the war, surviving the
crashes of two light planes behind enemy lines that forced him to
walk out of the jungle alone.</TE>
<TE>   Once, however, he suffered injuries that would plague him
throughout his life.</TE>
<TE>   After jumping into the water to guide six rubber boats loaded with
saboteurs and supplies, he was repeatedly smashed against the rocks
while attempting to return to the patrol boats.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered head injuries that required 18 months of
hospitalization after the war and thereafter plagued him with
headaches and occasional memory lapses.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, according to Moon, Stilwell suggested to Eifler that
a way should be found to kill Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, whom Stillwell
believed to be interested more in internal feuds in China than in
battling the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Eifler devised a plan to poison the Chinese generalissimo, but
Stillwell called it off at the last minute when, according to Moon,
Stillwell thought "he didn't have the moral authority to kill the
head of the world's largest nation."</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, OSS director Donovan recruited Eifler for another deadly
plan: to capture Werner Heisenberg, the Nazis' leading atomic
physicist.</TE>
<TE>   The plan Eifler devised entailed having him enter Germany, capture
Heisenberg and spirit him out of the country through Switzerland and
into a U.S. Army bomber, which would drop the two men to a waiting
submarine.</TE>
<TE>   Moon said the plan was aborted by Donovan after the Americans
successfully developed the atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Eifler set out to get the education he never had.
Once an agnostic, he became a Christian and earned a bachelor's
degree in divinity from Jackson College in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, he earned a doctorate in psychology from the
Illinois Institute of Technology and went to work for Monterey County
as a psychologist. He retired in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Moon, whose 1975 biography of Eifler is titled "The Deadliest
Colonel," said Preston Goodfellow, an OSS deputy director, gave
Eifler his moniker.</TE>
<TE>   "The tag just stuck," said Moon. "A couple of magazine articles
written about him called him the 'Deadliest Hombre,' but that word
'deadliest' just kind of stuck to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really the man for the times; he was absolutely fearless.
Later on, when he became a psychologist, he said, 'I never felt I'd
fail anything. I know that was not normal.'"</TE>
<TE>   Eifler's first wife, Lou, died in 1961. His second wife, Margaret,
died in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a stepson, Byron Hisey; and a sister, Hilda
Coleman.</TE>

<HD>Marines May Seek Delay on El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: Navy is set to announce the fate of the closed
base Tuesday, but a general says he might need time to study a plan
to move boot camp from San Diego to O.C. site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days before the Navy is expected to announce its decision on how
it will dispose of the El Toro Marine base, Commandant Gen. James
Jones said he may ask for a delay to allow study of a proposal to
move the Marines' West Coast boot camp from San Diego to the closed
base.</LD>
<LD>   Jones said Friday that he plans to meet with civic leaders in San
Diego and Orange County before deciding what he will recommend to
Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England. The Navy is set to announce
Tuesday what it plans for the former base.</LD>
<LD>   "There might be good reasons to take a deeper look" at moving the
recruit depot, Jones said, speaking in San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Jones said a study could be completed in 90 to 120 days. He said
England has not made a decision about El Toro: "He's exactly where I
am on it--not leaning too far one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Conceding that "it's a very emotional issue," he said he would
want the move to be satisfactory to both San Diego and Orange
counties, and beneficial to the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   "If San Diego is radically opposed and sees no value in expanding
the airport [Lindbergh Field, which is next to the recruit depot],
then I'm not particularly anxious to stir that up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido) caused a political
stir in both counties recently when he revealed that Jones had spoken
to him about shifting the recruit depot, which has been in San Diego
for 79 years, to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Noise from Lindbergh Field often causes problems at the depot,
which trains 20,000 recruits a year.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the depot has no live-fire ranges and no space for a crucial
piece of training known as the Crucible, where recruits spend several
days in the hills to determine their fitness to be Marines.</TE>
<TE>   For weapons training and the Crucible, recruits are sent to Camp
Pendleton, 40 miles north. What makes El Toro attractive, Jones said,
is the possibility of having firing ranges and Crucible terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor favoring El Toro, he said, is that it has several
thousand housing units. San Diego is so short of affordable housing
that the City Council is on the verge of declaring a "housing
emergency."</TE>
<TE>   At 388 acres, the San Diego recruit depot has long been deemed too
small. The El Toro base is about 4,700 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jones conceded that there are "legislative problems" that
would have to be overcome if the Marine Corps wanted to move its San
Diego training base, which handles all recruits west of the

<HD>El Toro May Still Be in Marines' Future</HD>
<DH>Land use: Navy is set to announce the fate of the closed
base Tuesday, but a general might ask for delay to study moving boot
camp from San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days before the Navy is expected to announce its decision on how
it will dispose of the El Toro Marine base, Commandant Gen. James
Jones said he may ask for a delay to allow study of a proposal to
move the Marines' West Coast boot camp from San Diego to the closed
base.</LD>
<LD>   Jones said Friday that he plans to meet with civic leaders in San
Diego and Orange counties before deciding what he will recommend to
Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England. The Navy is set to announce
Tuesday what it plans for the former base.</LD>
<LD>   "There might be good reasons to take a deeper look" at moving the
recruit depot, Jones said, speaking in San Diego. "It would make
sense to do that before we write the final words that would slam the
door on the process."</LD>
<TE>   Jones said a study could be completed in 90 to 120 days if he
thought one was worthwhile. He said England has not made a decision
about El Toro: "He's exactly where I am on it--not leaning too far
one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Conceding that "it's a very emotional issue," he said he would
want the move to be satisfactory to both San Diego and Orange
counties, and beneficial to the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   "If San Diego is radically opposed and sees no value in expanding
the airport [Lindbergh Field, which is next to the recruit depot],
then I'm not particularly anxious to stir that up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido) caused a political
stir in both counties recently when he revealed that Jones had spoken
to him about shifting the recruit depot, which has been in San Diego
for 79 years, to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Noise from Lindbergh Field often causes problems at the depot,
which trains 20,000 recruits a year. Even drill instructors sometimes
have to fall silent when jets roar overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the depot has no live-fire ranges and no space for a crucial
piece of training known as the Crucible, in which recruits spend
several days in the hills to determine their fitness to be Marines.</TE>
<TE>   For weapons training and the Crucible, recruits are sent to Camp
Pendleton, 40 miles north. What makes El Toro attractive, Jones said,
is the possibility of having firing ranges and Crucible terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor favoring El Toro, he said, is that it has several
thousand housing units. San Diego is so short of affordable housing
that the City Council is on the verge of declaring a "housing
emergency."</TE>
<TE>   At 388 acres, the San Diego recruit depot has long been deemed too
small. The El Toro base is about 4,700 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jones conceded that there are "legislative problems" that
would have to be overcome if the Marine Corps wanted to move its San
Diego training base, which handles all recruits west of the
Mississippi. Another problem is the cost, estimated at $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   He said the shift would have to be a "zero sum"--that is, that the
money would have to come from the sale of the San Diego property and
possibly a portion of the El Toro property.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to
welcome the Marines back, with three of the board members
overwhelmingly supporting such a move. But San Diego officials seem
split: the City Council has taken no position, and the congressional
delegation is split.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said the move would allow the crowded, single-runway
Lindbergh Field to expand. But airport planners have said the depot
property is too small and poorly situated to solve the airport's
problems.</TE>

<HD>Community Garden Takes Root in South Los Angeles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to a 71-year-old former school custodian and the contributions
of several philanthropic institutions and government agencies, South
Los Angeles has its first community garden--an 8,000-square-foot plot
straddling Vermont Avenue near the Coliseum where residents can grow
food for their families.</LD>
<LD>   Helen Johnson is the true founder of the Vermont Square Community
Garden, although she is quick to stress that it was the S. Mark Taper
Foundation that put up $80,000 to finance the project, including the
$58,000 it cost to buy the land on an old Red Car right of way from
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Another nonprofit group, the Trust for Public Land, brokered the
deal. City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo also put up some money, and the
nonprofit Los Angeles Community Garden Council now owns the property.</LD>
<TE>   Each neighborhood resident who farms a garden plot pays $2 a month
for the privilege and can maintain possession as long as he or she
makes those payments. The garden council provides the water, and the
Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks contributes
fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   "We are digging, creating and expanding," said City Councilwoman
Jan Perry at a dedication ceremony Friday, while Larry Kaplan of the
Trust for Public Land told of hopes to create many more community
gardens in Los Angeles, where 100 exist in some form already.</TE>
<TE>   "These residents have not only learned how to harvest their own
food, but they've made it happen by finding many supporters for their
dream," Kaplan said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands and Belgium are famous for their urban garden
plots. There, thousands of residents farm large plots on the edges of
cities, growing many of the vegetables and fruit they consume.</TE>
<TE>   New York City also has seen a rapid expansion of such plots.</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson began gathering support for the South Los Angeles
project, there was only an empty, abandoned lot. According to those
who spoke Friday, Johnson proved adept at seeking help, even from
religious institutions such as Los Angeles' Temple Israel, which
donated some fruit trees.</TE>
<TE>   Finding affordable land is a major impediment to such projects,
but the abandoned Red Car right of way proved to be just what was
needed in this instance.</TE>
<TE>   The garden looked well-watered and well-tended Friday, and it was
obvious that many vegetables were ready for harvesting. Others, such
as corn, are just starting their spring growth.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said he hopes that a community center can eventually be
built next to the garden.</TE>

<HD>National Guard to Halt Airport Security Duty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soldiers from the California National Guard, who have provided
anti-terrorist security at commercial airports since Oct. 5, will end
their deployment and return to their homes and regular jobs May 10, a
state military department official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman Lt. Col. Terry Knight said that he was uncertain who
would replace the National Guard members for duty at Los Angeles
International Airport and elsewhere, but that he understood it would
be law enforcement officers, at least until federal marshals can
relieve them permanently.</LD>
<LD>   More than 800 members of the California guard have served on
active duty as a security force at 28 of the state's airports since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of the call-up by President Bush, it was unknown how
long the Guard members would serve at the airports. Knight said state
officials were notified by the federal Transportation Security
Administration that the Guard's task would end May 10, although the
process of demobilization could last another three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Unaffected by the windup of the airport security mission will be
smaller groups of National Guard soldiers whom Gov. Gray Davis
ordered last fall to guard four suspension bridges against possible
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   No attacks occurred at the Golden Gate and Bay bridges in San
Francisco, the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro or the Coronado
Bridge in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>F. Kenneth Iverson, 76; Built Nucor Into No. 2 Steelmaker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>F. Kenneth Iverson, who turned a failing nuclear instruments company
into a firm that helped redefine the workings of the U.S. steel
industry, has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson died Sunday in Charlotte, N.C., of complications from
emphysema and heart trouble.</LD>
<LD>   In the mid-1960s, Iverson became president of the Nuclear Corp. of
America, a company based in Phoenix that was facing bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   "It was by default that I took over," Iverson told a reporter some
years ago. "Everyone else was too afraid to be at the helm of a
sinking ship."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson starting rebuilding the company around the Vulcraft steel
division. He sold or shuttered half the company's businesses and
moved the firm to Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   He implemented cutbacks that reduced the corporate staff to about
50, making it one of the smallest of a Fortune 500 company, and
dumped corporate perks such as company cars.</TE>
<TE>   The headquarters itself was part of a suburban Charlotte office
park. Iverson's office in the five-story nondescript building
overlooked a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   He often joked that the executive dining room was the delicatessen
across the street from the office. But joking aside, that's where
Iverson held his lunch meetings. When he visited company mills,
Iverson flew economy class and rented a car.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson said he got his ideas for Nucor--"a company without
walls"--from his first job after graduate school. He went to work at
Vulcraft, a maker of steel joists used in construction, as general
manager of a plant in South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "There were segregated high schools, segregated Christmas parties,
segregated bathrooms," Iverson told a reporter for Bloomberg News
some years ago. "The first thing I did was to tear down the bathroom
walls."</TE>
<TE>   In refocusing Nuclear Corp.--the name was changed to Nucor in
1972--Iverson decided to manufacture steel entirely in relatively
small factories using recycled steel scrap. Such mini-mills, which
make steel more cheaply and quickly, were copied by other steelmakers
and now produce more than half of all steel made in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The technology helped build Nucor into the country's
second-largest steelmaker. Iverson's incentive-based pay structure
was credited with driving up wages and productivity. He chose
managers with an entrepreneurial drive and gave them tremendous
autonomy, as long as they met financial expectations and treated
workers with respect.</TE>
<TE>   Nucor now has 8,400 employees and produced earnings last year of
more than $100 million. Sales last year topped $4.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Downers Grove, Ill., Iverson attended Northwestern
University before serving in the Navy during World War II. After the
war, he finished his course work in aeronautical engineering. He
later earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush awarded him the National Medal of
Technology in 1991. Iverson stepped down as Nucor's chief executive
in 1996 and resigned as chairman in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Martha, a daughter and a son.</TE>

<LD>Araceli Vallejo said she can't stand the look of frustration on her
mother's face when she tries to do her errands by phone and ends up
losing her call after waiting for someone who speaks Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   In such moments, said Vallejo, 18, she wishes she had the power to
change the law so there would be more help for immigrants like her
mother, who doesn't speak English yet.</LD>
<LD>   Using political muscle to make such changes was the theme of a
student conference Friday in Anaheim. Titled "2002 in 2002," its goal
is to eventually register at least 2,002 young Latino voters before
the November election. Among speakers were Rep. Loretta Sanchez
(D-Garden Grove); her sister Linda Sanchez, a candidate for a
congressional seat in Los Angeles County; and state Sen. Joe Dunn
(D-Garden Grove).</LD>
<TE>   The conference, organized by the Latino Youth Leadership
Institute, drew more than 500 high school and college students from
across Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Because an increasing number of students in Orange County's public
schools are Latino, getting them involved in Latino political issues
is essential, said Ignacio "Nash" Orozco, president of the institute.
Based in La Habra, the organization was founded recently as an
affiliate of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute in
Chicago. Funding for the youth conference came from corporate, labor
union and community donations.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose is to bring the students out of their neighborhoods
and show them that there are other things to life besides their
community," said Orozco, a technician for the city of Santa Ana. "We
just need to let them know that if they don't get involved in the
voting process, they'll never understand it."</TE>
<TE>   The mood of the conference, at the West Coast Anaheim Hotel, was
lively and upbeat. Students who had sat quietly through a morning of
speeches came alive after lunch when speakers began playing Mexican
rancheras alluding to the grape and lettuce boycotts organized by
farm labor leader Cesar Chavez. When the music changed to the
livelier beat of a merengue, energized students danced in the aisles,
on their chairs, even on the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Folk singer Jesus "Chuy" Negrete, who holds academic and honorary
degrees from several universities, including Stanford and UC
Berkeley, sang in Spanish and English about the Mexicans who have
left their homeland to find work in the United States. Accompanying
himself on harmonica and guitar, Negrete sang and spoke of their
struggles and the obstacles they face trying to adapt to U.S. culture
and climate. He heralded the contributions of immigrant families
"whose hands pick up the vegetables on America's table." He referred
to the migrants as the students' abuelos, or grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   "Learn your history," he told the students, who listened intently
to his 20-minute presentation. "You don't want to repeat history in
Santa Ana, you want to make history."</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring that point was speaker Randy Parraz, co-founder of
the youth institute. He emphasized that demographic shifts in Orange
County give young Latinos political momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Parraz, a Southern California field representative for the
AFL-CIO, urged the students to take advantage of the trend. "Those
numbers don't mean anything if we don't organize," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the daylong conference, 100 students had registered
to vote. One of those was Araceli Vallejo, who said she was inspired
by Rep. Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here went through different obstacles to get to were
they are," Vallejo said. "You never know what difference you can make
until you try."</TE>

<HD>Hitler's Birthday Party in La Habra Is Off, Group Says</HD>
<DH>Aryan Nations: Chapter is seeking a new venue after word
leaked out that it had booked the Moose Lodge. An official there says
the group misrepresented itself.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Aryan Nations group that booked a La Habra Moose Lodge for a party
today says publicity has forced it to move the event.</LD>
<LD>   A man who answered the phone at the number listed on the
white-supremacist group's Web site said Friday the event was canceled
after the location was revealed. He said a new location was being
sought. He would not give his name or other details.</LD>
<LD>   The Loyal Order of the Moose expressed shock on learning this week
that the Brandenburg Division, a chapter of the Aryan Nations based
in Long Beach, had booked the hall for a party celebrating Adolf
Hitler's birthday and had been promoting the event on the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   The event's location was given only as Orange County, and the
group's Web site said directions were on the tickets, which cost $15
in advance and $20 at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Promotions for the party said it would feature the rock band
Youngland, which sings white-supremacist lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending were asked to "dress appropriately" and were
reminded that "all National Socialist customs and traditions will be
observed."</TE>
<TE>   The Moose Lodge learned Thursday that its hall was identified by
the OC Weekly newspaper as the party's location.</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Stiller, an incoming Moose officer, said lodge records showed
that a fund-raiser had been scheduled for tonight, but the renting
party was not identified.</TE>
<TE>   A Hitler celebration would not have been allowed, Moose officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They misrepresented themselves," lodge officer Michael Mackey
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Moose lodge, through the La Habra Police
Department, announced the hall would be closed today.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to reach anybody to say that this event was
going to 100% happen there," said Cindy Knapp, a police spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But Moose officials didn't want to take any chances, she said.</TE>

<HD>James Martin Jr., 81; Oversaw 2 Missions to Mars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Martin Jr., a NASA engineer who in the 1970s was project
manager of the unmanned space missions to Mars known as Viking 1 and
2, the first U.S. expeditions to land safely on another planet, has
died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Martin died April 14 of cancer at a son's home in Crofton, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, an aerospace engineer, joined NASA's Langley Research
Center in 1964 as assistant project manager for the Lunar Orbiter
Project. The orbiters' five subsequent missions brought back
essential information about the moon later useful in the manned
Apollo flights.</LD>
<TE>   For his role in Lunar Orbiter, he received NASA's Exceptional
Service Medal in 1967. But a bigger-profile role was yet to come, on
the intricate nationwide, $1-billion effort known as Viking. Its
goals were to check for signs of life on the red planet and conduct
other studies for manned missions there.</TE>
<TE>   Martin became project manager in the late 1960s, and it was a
daunting endeavor. One scientist at the time likened the precision
involved to tossing a basketball from an arena in Los Angeles and
getting it through the hoop at Madison Square Garden in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He spent much of his time on charting cost and logistical
projections for the Viking expeditions, robot-controlled spacecraft
timed to land around the nation's bicentennial in July 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he oversaw 750 scientists and technicians
coordinating a trip of more than 500 million miles. He used data from
the Mariner orbiters already circling Mars to select safe landing
spots for Viking on what appeared to be a knotty surface.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was known for his austere and sensible manner, often
canceling contracts with contractors when they failed to make
deadlines. He said sloppiness would cost NASA, and taxpayers,
hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Problems did arise. Technical mishaps wound up delaying both
launches by several days.</TE>
<TE>   Two identical Viking rockets went up from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on
Aug. 20 and Sept. 9, 1975. After changes in the original landing
plans based on new information, Viking 1 made it to Mars on July 20,
1976, and Viking II on Sept. 3 of that year.</TE>
<TE>   The thousands of color images sent back by the Viking spacecraft
revealed tantalizing pictures of Mars as a flat, rock-covered plain
with long, narrow clouds floating in a reddish sky. Soil and
atmospheric analyses also were conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Though designed to last only 90 days, both Viking landers
continued to transmit information back to Earth into the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Martin resigned from NASA at the end of 1976 to become vice
president of advanced programs and planning for Martin Marietta
Aerospace in Bethesda, Md. He retired in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   He continued working as a NASA consultant, with projects such as
the Mars Pathfinder mission of the mid-1990s. That was the only other
U.S. project to land successfully on Mars.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he was asked back to help restructure the Mars
exploration program after expensive mishaps with the Climate Orbiter
and Polar Lander.</TE>
<TE>   He played a role in the Mars Odyssey mission, which was launched
in 2001 and continues to send back data about Mars while it orbits
the planet.</TE>
<TE>   James Slattin Martin Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up
in Springfield, Ill. He liked building model airplanes, and by his
early teens was designing gas-powered craft. Sometimes he tried too
hard, as when he overloaded two planes with fuel and then launched
them.</TE>
<TE>   "My father and I tried to follow them in the car, but never did
find them," he said in his official NASA biography.</TE>
<TE>   He was a 1942 aeronautical engineering graduate of the University
of Michigan; during summers he worked on an assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   He credited that experience with teaching him how to balance his
interest in design with what would work.</TE>
<TE>   From 1942 to 1964, he worked for Republic Aviation Corp. in New
York. During World War II, he worked on design for the P-47
Thunderbolt fighter and the F-84, a pioneering fighter jet. He left
Republic as manager of space systems requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Frieda Rexroth Martin; two children
from his first marriage; two children from his second marriage; a
sister; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>MTBE Phaseout Cost in Billions, Analyst Says</HD>
<DH>Environment: Good news is frequency of fuel additive, a
possible carcinogen, found in wells less than forecast, state
official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gasoline additive that may cause cancer has had far less impact on
the state's drinking-water supply than expected, and replacing it
will drive gasoline prices up to $1 billion more than Gov. Gray Davis
expected when he banned it, according to a California Energy
Commission analyst.</LD>
<LD>   Still, analyst Gordon Schremp and other state officials said they
support Davis' decision to phase out MTBE, or methyl tertiary-butyl
ether, by the end of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "MTBE needs to go. Period," said William L. Rukeyser, assistant
secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency. "The
numbers are important, but they are not something that drives the
decision [to ban] MTBE....The reason the decision is not going to be
revisited is because of environmental concerns and the very great
importance that this administration attaches to water quality
throughout the state."</LD>
<TE>   But MTBE producers are seizing upon Schremp's gasoline-price
estimates to urge Davis to rethink his executive order.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people have dug in their heels on this issue," said Frank
Maisano, spokesman for the Oxygenated Fuels Assn., a coalition of
MTBE producers based in Washington, D.C. "This is going to have to
cause some sort of reexamination of the policies that California puts
in place."</TE>
<TE>   MTBE is added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner, which reduces
air pollution. Use of MTBE became common in the 1990s, but research
revealed it is a probable carcinogen that spreads quickly through the
groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Davis announced a phaseout of the chemical by the end of
this year. But last month, he said the ban would be delayed a year
because of concerns about gasoline shortages and price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, Schremp told a gathering at the World Fuels
Conference in San Antonio that the cost projections Davis used to
make his 1999 decision to ban MTBE turned out to be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   University of California research in 1998 projected that annual
water-cleanup bills could reach $1.5 billion if MTBE were kept in
gasoline, but Schremp said that by using new assumptions gleaned from
four years of MTBE experience, cleanup costs would be less than
one-sixth of that figure.</TE>
<TE>   "The frequency of MTBE showing up in wells is a lot less than
anticipated in the UC study," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schremp added that the cleanup figures do not include oil
companies' liability for contamination.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco jury is to begin deliberations Monday to determine
how much to award a South Lake Tahoe utility after more than
one-third of that city's wells were shut down because of MTBE.
Cleanup could reach $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Similar lawsuits have been filed across the country, including
Santa Monica and Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Energy commission research in 1998 said replacing MTBE with
ethanol would cost $450 million annually, but Schremp said he now
projects that replacing MTBE could cost up to $1 billion more
annually, plus a possible one-time price increase of $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schremp said the answer is not to allow MTBE to remain in
gasoline, but to continue pursuing a federal waiver so that
California doesn't have to include any additive in its gasoline--a
position backed by the governor's office, the state's U.S. senators
and environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   But MTBE producers said the new cost estimates are a rational,
well-reasoned argument to keep MTBE in gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "MTBE in groundwater is a manageable issue," said David Harpole,
spokesman for Lyondell Chemical Co., the world's largest MTBE
producer. Environmentalists said that's absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to pollute water and then try to clean it up,"
said Will Rostov, a staff attorney with Communities for a Better
Environment.</TE>
<TE>   However, Harpole said he hopes the state's leadership will
consider the new cost estimates and decide that MTBE has a role in
California.</TE>
<TE>   But Rukeyser said, "The decision has been made and it's
final....California is going to get rid of MTBE in gasoline, and
we're going to do that before the rest of the country."</TE>

<HD>Feuding Nixon Daughters Are Told to Negotiate</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Orange County jurist offers to mediate the battle
over control of a $20-million bequest. Both sides agree, but lawsuits
in Florida and California are pending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County probate judge on Friday urged former President
Nixon's two daughters and the library that bears his name to work out
their differences and end a legal fight over how to spend a
$20-million bequest.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said it would be a mistake for the parties to battle
over the bequest and offered to mediate. All sides welcomed the
offer.</LD>
<LD>   Nixon's daughters are feuding over how to spend a bequest to the
library made by the former president's longtime friend, Charles
"Bebe" Rebozo, who died in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Julie Nixon Eisenhower and the library board are demanding that
the money be spent exclusively on the library. But Tricia Nixon Cox
favors a plan that would give the sisters and a Nixon friend, Robert
Abplanalp, control of the money.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the disagreement, the money remains tied up by a
Florida probate court, which is sorting out Rebozo's estate. The
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation filed lawsuits this
year in Miami, where Rebozo died, and in Orange County, site of the
library. The suits demand that the money be handed over to the
foundation immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a Miami probate judge said it was the sisters' duty to
settle the matter out of court and suggested she might throw out the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard O. Frazee
Sr. put off a decision on whether California courts can weigh in on
the matter and urged the parties to settle.</TE>
<TE>   Frazee said he will wait to hear from attorneys for the sisters
and the library before arranging mediation. "This court could be a
great help," said Eisenhower's lawyer, John Deily.</TE>
<TE>   "I have unlimited confidence in Mr. Frazee's ability," added Cox's
attorney, Thomas Malcolm. "If he's willing to serve in that capacity
[as mediator], I think it would be wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   In a sign, however, that the dispute may not be easily resolved,
Cox's lawyer issued a news release demanding that the library
foundation immediately drop its efforts to "rewrite the clear terms
of Mr. Rebozo's trust." The release said Rebozo wanted the former
president's daughters to control the money, not the library
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm, Cox's attorney, was particularly critical of foundation
executive director John H. Taylor, whom he said "has caused a public
spectacle and controversy [and] attempted to divide the Nixon family
and friends."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the foundation insisted Taylor is trying to ensure
that the money is spent on the library. The foundation hopes to put
the money into an endowment that could provide the library more than
$1 million annually.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Daughters Told to Settle Feud</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Orange County judge offers to mediate the battle
over control of a $20-million bequest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County probate judge on Friday urged former President
Richard M. Nixon's two daughters and the library that bears his name
to work out their differences and end a legal fight over how to spend
a $20-million bequest.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said it would be a mistake for the parties to battle
over the bequest and offered to mediate. All sides welcomed the
offer.</LD>
<LD>   Nixon's daughters are feuding over how to spend a bequest to the
library made by the former president's longtime friend, Charles
''Bebe'' Rebozo, who died in 1998. Julie Nixon Eisenhower and the
library board are demanding that the money be spent exclusively on
the library. But Tricia Nixon Cox favors a plan that would give the
sisters and a Nixon friend, Robert Abplanalp, control of the money.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the disagreement, the money remains tied up by a
Florida probate court, which is sorting out Rebozo's estate. The
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation filed lawsuits this
year in Miami, where Rebozo died, and in Orange County, site of the
library. The suits demand that the money be handed over to the
foundation immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a Miami probate judge said it was the sisters' duty to
settle the matter out of court and suggested she might throw out the
lawsuit. On Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard O.
Frazee Sr. put off a decision on whether California courts can weigh
in on the matter and urged the parties to settle.</TE>
<TE>   Frazee said he will wait to hear from attorneys for the sisters
and the library before arranging mediation. ''This court could be a
great help,'' said Eisenhower's lawyer, John Deily.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have unlimited confidence in Mr. Frazee's ability,'' added
Cox's attorney, Thomas Malcolm. ''If he's willing to serve in that
capacity [as mediator], I think it would be wonderful.''</TE>
<TE>   In a sign, however, that the dispute may not be easily resolved,
Cox's lawyer issued a news release demanding that the library
foundation immediately drop its efforts to ''rewrite the clear terms
of Mr. Rebozo's trust.'' The release said Rebozo wanted the former
president's daughters to control the money, not the library
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm, Cox's attorney, was particularly critical of foundation
executive director John H. Taylor, whom he said ''has caused a public
spectacle and controversy [and] attempted to divide the Nixon family
and friends.''</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the foundation insisted Taylor is trying to ensure
that the money is spent on the library. The foundation hopes to put
the money into an endowment that could provide the library more than
$1 million annually. At the root of the problem is the sisters'
disagreement about what role Taylor and the 24-member board should
play in managing the Rebozo gift.</TE>
<TE>   Cox favors a plan that would allow the sisters and Abplanalp to
manage the money.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower wants the library foundation to control the gift.
Because of the battle, the bequest has been frozen for three years.</TE>

<HD>Many Wonder What's in Store for Oaks Mall</HD>
<DH>Retail: Shopping center's pending sale has merchants and
city officials hoping for a new upscale tenant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the owners of The Oaks shopping center mull purchase offers,
merchants and Thousand Oaks city officials are hoping a new
proprietor will burnish the center's image by going after a
higher-end department store.</LD>
<LD>   "We have customers each day that say they would like to see
something like a Nordstrom, Saks or Bloomingdale's," said Joe Perez,
manager of Ben Bridge Jewelers.</LD>
<LD>   Perez said the mall is well managed and enjoys robust sales. But
he and other shopkeepers lament the redundancy in the mall's anchor
stores. Because of mergers during the mid-1990s, The Oaks ended up
being anchored by two Robinsons-May and two Macy's stores. There is
also a JCPenney.</LD>
<TE>   The city of Thousand Oaks also wants more of a choice for
shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want any future buyer to be looking at the mall as a quality
mall that deserves additional investment," said Deputy City Manager
Jim Friedl. "Perhaps even adding a significant retailer."</TE>
<TE>   The mall is primarily owned by the California State Teachers'
Retirement System. Toronto-based TrizecHahn Corp., which manages the
center for the public school educators' pension fund, owns a minority
share.</TE>
<TE>   As for the shopping center's hush-hush price tag, an approximate
market value of $165 million has been "discussed loosely," said
Thousand Oaks Economic Development Manager Gary Wartik. CalSTRS
purchased the mall in 1991 for $94 million, according to a CalSTRS
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   If the mall is sold, the deal would represent only about 60% of
the overall property, Wartik said. That is because the anchor stores
own their respective real estate and accompanying parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Although TrizecHahn officials declined to provide specific details
of their search for suitors, city officials said a sealed-bid process
concluded last week.</TE>
<TE>   Three potential buyers have contacted Thousand Oaks officials for
"getting-to-know-you" consultations, Friedl said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to want to know what the local government is
like," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While any deal is ultimately a private transaction between buyer
and seller, Friedl said, the city wants a buyer committed to securing
the long-term health of the mall.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can do is put out a positive message about what kind of
buyer we are hoping to be able to embrace," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the sealed-bid process concluded, Wartik said, mall
management is now likely reviewing any offers. "We would anticipate
that management might narrow it down in a matter of some weeks," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   CalSTRS officials would not discuss their decision to sell the
shopping center. Rick Matthews, a spokesman with TrizecHahn, said the
sale reflects his company's corporate restructuring from a
Canadian-based real estate company to a U.S.-based real estate
investment trust.</TE>
<TE>   The city gained $2.3 million in tax revenue for fiscal year
2000-2001 from the mall--second behind Thousand Oaks Auto Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Ernest Hahn opened The Oaks in 1978 on about 90 acres
encircled by West Hillcrest Drive, Lynn Road and the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   With 130 stores and more than 1 million square feet of floor
space, the mall was the county's largest retail center for years,
until the recent renovation of the Pacific View Mall in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   And there is good reason to grow, Wartik said, because research
has shown that many area residents travel outside the county to shop
at upscale stores.</TE>
<TE>   "For many years, people have wanted something like a Nordstrom or
a Bloomingdale's because the area demands that," said Kamal Darwiche,
owner of Final Touch, a collectibles shop at the mall. "Many
customers say they have to drive to the Valley or Santa Barbara if
they want to shop at a fine department store."</TE>

<LD>A controversial fourplex that a developer proposed to improve with
city funds and rent to low-income tenants reportedly was sold for
$800,000 Friday at a probate-court auction in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The identity of the bidder was not available, but a neighbor who
attended the auction said it was not the Laguna Beach developer who
had proposed the improvements and subsidy deal to the city three
months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The developer had proposed using $400,000 of city
affordable-housing redevelopment funds. Residents of the neighborhood
on Ocean Avenue and a City Council candidate had questioned whether
the city should subsidize rents in the upscale beach area.</LD>

<LD>Now for a new type of phone solicitation. KNX radio anchor Dick
Helton writes that he was waiting in his Jeep at a stoplight on
Sunset Boulevard when "an obviously homeless man came up to my window
and asked, 'Could you spare some cell minutes?'"</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of high-tech panhandlers: In Santa Monica, Bob Patterson
spotted a guy with a sign that said: "www.anysparechange.com."</LD>
<LD>   Service, whether you want it or not: The corner of 4th and Los
Angeles streets seems to be the workplace of several human
window-washers--the street people who spray your window with some
unknown substance, rub a dirty cloth on it and then ask for money.</LD>
<TE>   I was stopped at a light when one of these characters approached,
and I noticed a couple of other drivers in line--obviously veterans
of this route--who went into an anti-beggar mode.</TE>
<TE>   They pulled up to within a few inches of the cars in front so that
the window-washer couldn't squeeze in.</TE>
<TE>   Markings of a past civilization? Ed Stalcup of Malibu noticed a
not-too-ancient pictograph while driving up north near Monterey (see
photo). An adjacent sign said: "Kayak Crossing."</TE>
<TE>   Weird world of animals: Eve Tusler of Pasadena saw an
advertisement for some pigs that must have jumped out of fat bottles
and another one for an exercise program for mollusks (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Annals of strange crime: The Huntington Beach Wave's police log
said a man complained "that a customer came into his store and threw
a banana on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Stealing a base is one thing ... : The Long Beach Press-Telegram's
police log included this item: "Grand theft; baseball pitching
machine valued at $1,500; from a field at Cypress College." May the
thieves be thrown out at home by the cops.</TE>
<TE>   Technicalities, technicalities: Gov. Gray Davis delights in
dismissing Pacific Palisades businessman Bill Simon, his Republican
rival, as someone who has never been elected to public office and has
never voted in a Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the nonvoting issue hasn't hurt a couple of past
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The late Sonny Bono acknowledged he had never voted until he ran
for mayor of Palm Springs at the age of 53. He won easily (helped by
his own vote, presumably).</TE>
<TE>   And Vice President Dick Cheney admitted during the 2000
presidential campaign that while he was registered to vote in Texas,
he had failed to vote in 14 of the previous 16 elections in that
state--including that year's presidential primary.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Reporter Joe Shea wrote a large check to the IRS
Monday morning, then drove to the L.A. County Courthouse to cover a
trial.</TE>
<TE>   At the metal detector, he told an officer: "You know this is the
second time I've emptied my pockets this morning."</TE>

Cultural Center.</LD>
<LD>   If the desert has an attic stuffed with memorabilia, this is it.
Along a dirt road christened "Boulevard of Dreams" sits a collection
of outdoor mementos--abandoned outhouses, gold-mining machinery, a
rusting John Deere tractor, a cannon, all donated and trucked in from
across the Mojave.</LD>
<TE>   But the real treasure is tucked away inside two trailers, a
library and the freshly repainted Goffs schoolhouse. Stored there are
more than 700 oral histories, 4,000 maps and 40,000 photographs.</TE>
<TE>   For close to 20 years, Dennis Casebier, a retired naval physicist,
has been searching out old-timers in nursing homes and trailer parks
across the United States and Canada, tapping into their memories to
construct a genealogy of the High Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine today, but this whole valley was once dotted
with farms and railroads and post offices and stores," he said,
gazing at the wind-blasted landscape.</TE>
<TE>   There are half a dozen lonely little towns like Goffs scattered
across the eastern Mojave Desert and scores more fading rural
outposts in California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Originally brought to life by homesteads, railroads and mines,
many blossomed when Route 66 was built. Long after interstate
highways reduced the "Mother Road" to a meandering byway, some of the
mostly empty towns somehow hang on.</TE>
<TE>   "If you drive that old route, you can see remnants of these little
communities," said Dennis Schramm, assistant manager of the
1.6-million-acre Mojave National Preserve, which Goffs borders. "I've
seen 'em in Utah, and off the 395 headed up to Mammoth."</TE>
<TE>   Goffs was founded in 1883, when a railroad siding was built at the
top of a hill here. Route 66 came through in 1926, along one edge of
what is now the Casebiers' place. Goffs flourished until 1931, when
the road was realigned six miles away.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearby Lanfair Valley, homesteaders began arriving in 1910.
Anyone who "dry-farmed" for three years--planting crops without
imported irrigation from the Colorado River--got free title to the
land from the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   For a few rainy winters in the 1900s' and early teens, peach trees
and beans and watermelons flourished in the desert. But years of
drought devastated the farms, and most people moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Goffs enjoyed a revival of sorts during World War II, when 10,000
soldiers at a time were stationed here and living in tents. They
burned up most of the old buildings, piece by piece, to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 11 bumpy miles from Interstate 40, Goffs is a smattering of
manufactured homes and trailers next to the railroad tracks. Freight
trains still roar past.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ghosting," Dennis Casebier said matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   Casebier said he fell in love with the desert while in military
training in Twentynine Palms during the Korean War. During his naval
career, whenever he was in Washington, D.C., he would hole up in the
National Archives at night, poring over land patent files, old maps
and photos of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   When he retired in 1990, a ranching couple who had moved into the
decaying Goffs schoolhouse offered to sell it and 113 acres to the
Casebiers for $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The earth here looks bare and dusty, but kick it around and you'll
come across a fragment of the multilayered past--a soldier's dog tag,
a grinding stone used by the Paiute Indians or a railroad "date" nail
with the year it was made pounded into the top.</TE>
<TE>   Using the Internet, property and voter registration records, and
word-of-mouth, Casebier has tracked down hundreds of east Mojave
old-timers and captured their memories on tape.</TE>
<TE>   There is the voice of Sara Dean, the daughter of black
homesteaders from Arkansas who said her family didn't experience
prejudice here, though they never went to the picnics or dances held
regularly at the schoolhouse. Dean died about two years ago, Casebier
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many people spoke of gunfighter Bill Hollimon, whom Casebier has
dubbed the "Robin Hood of the Mojave."</TE>
<TE>   According to Casebier, Hollimon, an excellent marksman, took on
the wealthy owners of the Rocky Springs Land and Cattle Co. because
they refused to share water with their farming neighbors and allowed
their cattle to stampede across others' property.</TE>
<TE>   Hollimon would ride through the night with a pair of .45-caliber
pistols, Casebier said, and wherever he stopped, there would be fresh
Rocky Springs beef hanging on a post next to a farmer's house at
dawn. Hollimon died of old age, Casebier believes. He is still
looking for descendants of Hollimon and the Rocky Springs owners.</TE>
<TE>   Casebier doesn't miss much. When he had a heart attack in 1997, he
noticed while being rolled into an operating room that the orderly's
name tag said Nay.</TE>
<TE>   The Nays were desert pioneer brothers whose relatives Casebier had
been seeking for years. Sure enough, he learned just before receiving
anesthesia that the orderly was a descendant.</TE>
<TE>   At 67, Casebier frets about the future of his collection. He has
set up a nonprofit organization and is "nurturing" volunteers who
drive out from the Los Angeles area on weekends to help with research
and restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Part of him knows it would make sense to partner with his
neighbor, the Mojave National Preserve. But part of him can't bear
the thought. For this gruff contrarian, "national parkizing" is a
"politically correct" mistake and waste of public dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "All they care about is the critters," he said, referring to the
desert tortoise and other endangered species that are a focus of the
park's preservation efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I like critters too, but they're missing a huge part of the
resources out here--the cultural resources, the history."</TE>
<TE>   Schramm of the Mojave National Preserve said Casebier's collection
is "unmatched" and that preserve officials would like to work with
him. Park attendance is increasing, as Casebier knows.</TE>
<TE>   "City folk and environmentalists," he scoffed. Yet, he and Jo Ann
open their grounds to the public several weekends each year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he invited two park rangers to his place to look at a
railroad baggage case he will donate to them for an exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings," he said. "It's so important for people to
know their history."</TE>
<TE>   An open house will be held at Goffs schoolhouse April 27 and 28,
and again in October. For information, call (760) 733-4360, or send
an e-mail to goffs@eastmojave.net.</TE>

<LD>Joe W. Johnson, 93, professor emeritus of civil and environmental
engineering at UC Berkeley, died April 11 at his home in Victoria,
British Columbia, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Kansas, Johnson grew up in Winslow, Ariz., and Los
Angeles. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in civil
engineering at Berkeley. After graduating, he joined the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss.,
and the Soil Conversation Service in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson joined the Berkeley faculty in 1942. He became an
authority on coastal engineering during his 33-year tenure at
Berkeley and helped define it as a separate discipline within civil
engineering.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of the first researchers to really study beach
erosion, particularly in areas of development," said Robert Wiegel, a
longtime colleague at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Johnson served as a consultant for state,
federal and international organizations on shoreline and harbor
problems.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moses Lasky, 94, a prominent San Francisco trial lawyer whose clients
included the Oakland Raiders and J. Paul Getty, died April 7 of
complications from pneumonia at a San Francisco hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Denver, the son of Polish immigrants, Lasky entered the
University of Colorado at the age of 14 and financed his education by
selling books door to door. Before his 21st birthday, he had earned
his bachelor's and law degrees. Too young to be admitted to the bar,
Lasky enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he earned a master's
degree.</LD>
<LD>   He moved to San Francisco and eventually became a senior partner
at the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison. He later was a
founder of the law firm of Lasky, Haas, Choler &amp; Munter.</LD>
<TE>   Along with Joseph Alioto, Lasky represented the Raiders in the
1980s. In one highly publicized case, the city of Oakland ended up
paying the Raiders $4 million for lost revenue from broadcasting,
attendance and luxury suites.</TE>
<TE>   A collector of modern art, Lasky was a member of the board of the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</TE>

<HD>Policy Changed at Rat-Plagued Crypt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County coroner's office will soon begin cremating
unidentified and unclaimed bodies stored in a crypt where rats
recently were found.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen of the roughly 60 bodies in the long-term storage facility
had been partly eaten by rats. Workers had complained that the
problem was the result of keeping unpreserved corpses for extended
periods; one of them had been dead since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey on Friday said his office had
erred in keeping the bodies until all leads on identification and
next of kin had been exhausted. Now, bodies unidentified or unclaimed
for longer than six months will be marked for cremation.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 50 bodies have been marked for cremation, which could begin
as early as next week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come to the realization that we're storing bodies longer
than we need to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Exterminators continue to visit the crypt daily in an effort to
wipe out the rat infestation, which was discovered in February.</TE>

<LD>A four-unit apartment house that stirred controversy over a
developer's plan to use city funds to improve it and rent it to
low-income tenants reportedly was sold for $800,000 Friday at a
probate court auction in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The identity of the bidder was not available, but a neighbor who
attended the auction said it was not the Laguna Beach developer who
had proposed the improvements and subsidy deal to the city three
months ago. The developer had proposed using $400,000 of city
redevelopment funds earmarked for affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of the neighborhood on Ocean Avenue and a City Council
candidate had questioned whether the city should be spending money
for rent subsidies in the upscale beach area.</LD>

<HD>CSU Channel Islands Installs New President</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: Richard Rush calls event a tribute to Ventura
County residents who fought for a four-year campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Channel Islands President Richard Rush was formally
installed into office Friday during a colorful, pomp-filled ceremony
meant to launch a series of events leading up to the opening of the
Camarillo campus in late August.</LD>
<LD>   Clad in a burgundy robe, and flanked by colleagues and university
officials bedecked in academic regalia, Rush was confirmed by CSU
Chancellor Charles B. Reed before hundreds of supporters, some of
whom had traveled halfway across the country to wish him well.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Rush told the crowd that the ceremony was less a
celebration of individual achievement than a tribute to the many
people who have worked to turn the dream of Ventura County's first
four-year public university into a reality.</LD>
<TE>   "I accept this responsibility in the name of the people of Ventura
County, who for over 30 years sought a four-year public university to
serve this area," said Rush, who accepted the $200,000-a-year job in
March 2001 after nearly a decade as president of Minnesota State
University at Mankato. He started at Channel Islands in June.</TE>
<TE>   "Today marks the beginning of the celebration of a dream come
true," he said. "Though this ceremony inaugurates a president, it is
truly the celebration of this community's vision and commitment."</TE>
<TE>   After years of planning and preparation, Cal State Channel Islands
will open Aug. 26 at the former Camarillo State Hospital complex.</TE>
<TE>   While there will be a number of events leading up to that
day--including opening ceremonies Aug. 16 and a black-tie
presidential fund-raising dinner the following day--Friday's ceremony
marked the stretch run for the long-awaited campus, the 23rd in the
Cal State University system and the first since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of history and achievement did not go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) congratulated those in
attendance for being the driving force behind the creation of the new
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I have goose bumps," the congresswoman said. "I have chills
tingling up and down my spine at the occasion this brings us: the
birth of this university."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jack O'Connell, who has carried legislation and budget
bills to make the new campus a reality, commended the work of those
who had come before Rush. He praised people such as founding
President Handel Evans, who marched in a processional ushering the
new president to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell then turned his attention to Rush.</TE>
<TE>   "In President Rush, we have the right man for the right job at the
right time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then student Eleanora Bruno stepped forward, offering words of
encouragement for Rush from the inaugural class.</TE>
<TE>   "We wish you continued strength and wisdom for the challenges
ahead," said Bruno, who was the first student accepted to the Channel
Islands campus and who plans to study business. "Shoot for the moon.
Even if you miss, you will land among the stars."</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of the university's bell tower building, one of a
handful of sun-bleached state hospital structures renovated and ready
to receive students, Rush stepped forward to accept a bronze
medallion commemorating his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Then he spoke with reverence about the responsibility he had been
given. And he promised that he and his faculty and staff would not
let the community down.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to state most clearly that this university will focus on
students and their successes," said Rush, who served as a faculty
member and administrator for nearly 20 years with the Cal State
system before assuming the top job at Mankato in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "We will engage students' minds and foster their aspirations," he
said. "Together, we will create the future, not simply inherit it."</TE>

<HD>SAG Rejects Agreement Between Actors, Agents</HD>
<DH>Labor: In a defeat for union leaders, members vote down
changes in rules on investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screen Actors Guild members turned down a new agreement late Friday
governing relations between agents and actors that would have allowed
investments by advertising companies and producers in Hollywood
talent agencies.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly 55% voting to reject, members sided with those who
argued that the proposal would blur the line between agent and
employer. It would create conflicts, they said, because an agent
might represent an actor in a movie, for instance, in which the
agent's company had a financial interest. The agent, therefore, might
not act in the client's best interest.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents included Richard Dreyfuss, Rob Schneider, Charlton
Heston and Jason Alexander.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a major defeat for SAG leadership, which had
marshaled its staff and numerous stars in support of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Led by President Melissa Gilbert, SAG had argued that the proposal
included numerous safeguards and other sweeteners that would bolster
the union's sagging finances. Supporters included Danny Glover, Helen
Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and "West Wing" cast members
Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and Bradley Whitford.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Gilbert said: "SAG's mandate remains unchanged.
SAG will continue to do what is in the best interests of all guild
members."</TE>
<TE>   Only about 30% of SAG's 98,000 members even have agents, but all
members were allowed to vote under the union's rules. The final tally
was 13,977 to 11,680.</TE>
<TE>   At stake was a new "franchise agreement" between agents and the
union to replace an expired one that had been in place since 1939
largely to protect actors from unscrupulous agents. Agents who want
to represent a SAG actor must agree to abide by the agreement, which
governs such matters as commissions, financial interests for agents
and other items.</TE>
<TE>   The rejection of a new agreement throws the relationship between
actors and agents into confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, agents are no longer bound by any agreement and
could sell themselves to companies involved in production or invest
in producers themselves. But realistically they might face a backlash
from stars they represent.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, executives at talent agencies privately said Friday that
they don't expect anything drastic to happen soon, adding that most
agencies will study their options carefully over the next few months
before making any moves.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Assn. of Talent Agents and the smaller
National Assn. of Talent Agents trade groups strongly suggested that
their members will do what they want and may take legal action if SAG
tries to stop them. The groups accused a minority opposition group of
sabotaging the deal "by disseminating inaccurate and irresponsible
information."</TE>
<TE>   They added: "We have waited patiently while the SAG leadership has
changed hands three times and squandered countless opportunities for
their working membership."</TE>
<TE>   They said that they will look for "the most expansive creative and
economic opportunities available."</TE>
<TE>   The debate caused a bitter split in an already fractious guild.
SAG has been beset by internal bickering between moderate and more
confrontational forces for three years.</TE>
<TE>   During one meeting this month to discuss the proposal, members
objected to the presence of security guards, calling them
intimidating. A board of local Hollywood members censured Gilbert for
a telemarketing campaign to support the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing that they are unfairly hamstrung by the rules, agents for
more than two years have pressed for a new deal.</TE>
<TE>   They say they need fresh capital to expand their businesses, and
should be allowed to diversify into such areas as modeling and sports
agencies, public relations or foreign film distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Agents argue that such deals would create jobs for clients by
giving the firms a shot in the arm financially, as well as forming
alliances that would create projects.</TE>
<TE>   The deal agreed to in February would have allowed advertising
agencies, major advertisers and even independent production companies
to buy as much as 20% of a talent agency.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, agencies for the first time could have owned as much
as 20% of the production companies that make movies and TV shows.
Studios and their parent companies would have been barred from buying
into an agency.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was advocated by the Assn. of Talent Agents, with
Hollywood's largest agencies--Creative Artists Agency, International
Creative Management, the William Morris Agency, United Talent Agency
and Endeavor--the major forces behind the new agreement.</TE>

<HD>No Evidence of Struggle in Victim's Car, Judge Told</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Forensic expert says blood stains inside slain
student's vehicle don't suggest she was fending off an attack after
being shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although blood was spattered and smeared in slain Moorpark College
student Megan Barroso's car, a forensic scientist testified Friday
there was no evidence of a struggle inside the bullet-riddled
vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Crime lab experts found numerous blood stains throughout the front
section of Barroso's car, scientist Ed Jones told a judge at the
preliminary hearing for Vincent Sanchez, accused of killing the
20-year-old Moorpark woman.</LD>
<LD>   But those stains did not suggest Barroso was fending off an attack
after being shot, Jones testified.</LD>
<TE>   Barroso disappeared in the early morning of July 5 after leaving a
party. Her car was found abandoned near a freeway overpass in
Moorpark, and her remains were found a month later in a ravine near
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Sanchez, a 31-year-old Simi Valley handyman, fired
shots at the car, then abducted and sexually assaulted Barroso before
she died.</TE>
<TE>   The death penalty is being sought by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys say there is no evidence of rape. They have
tried to show throughout their client's preliminary hearing in
Ventura County Superior Court that Barroso could have died almost
immediately after being shot in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, scientists offered evidence that could support either
theory.</TE>
<TE>   While Jones found no sign of a struggle, suggesting Barroso could
have been unconscious or dead after being shot, he also found more
than 20 blood stains around her purse and a small makeup case that
could suggest she was alive and trying to reach for her cellular
phone.</TE>
<TE>   The phone was found on the passenger floor next to the spilled
contents of the blood-stained makeup case. Those stains, Jones
testified, were consistent for a person with a bloody hand who was
trying to open the case. The coroner also found metal fragments in
Barroso's right hand.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the blood evidence, a firearms expert testified
that six bullets ripped through Barroso's rented Pontiac Sunfire. One
pierced the hood, three went through the windshield, and one tore
through the rear passenger door and exited through the rear
driver-side door.</TE>
<TE>   A sixth bullet was fired through the front driver-side door.
Firearms expert Jim Roberts examined bullet fragments taken from
Barroso's body at the autopsy and matched them to an assault rifle
seized from the defendant's home.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume Monday.</TE>

<HD>Simon Tripped Up by Queries on State Taxes</HD>
<DH>Campaign: A spokesman for GOP gubernatorial hopeful insists
nominee has paid every year. 'This is enough,' candidate says. Davis
camp keeps hammering on issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. said Friday that he
paid California income taxes for his earnings last year, but was
unsure whether he had done so each year over the previous decade.</LD>
<LD>   A campaign spokesman, James Fisfis, said later that Simon had, in
fact, paid California income taxes every year since moving to the
state in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The effort to explain Simon's tax history came as the
multimillionaire candidate continued to refuse Gov. Gray Davis'
demand that he release his past tax returns. Simon has requested an
extension for filing his 2001 tax return.</LD>
<TE>   "At some point you say, jeez, this is enough disclosure," Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the April 15 tax filing deadline, Davis has used Simon's
refusal to release his returns as a weapon to cast Simon as a rich
wheeler-dealer out of touch with ordinary Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in turn, has compared Davis to Karl Marx and "Big Brother"
for saying Simon should prove to voters that he paid his "fair share"
of taxes.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon sparked more criticism from the Davis campaign
when he said he was unsure whether he paid any California income
taxes last year.</TE>
<TE>   But at a campaign stop on Friday in Anaheim, Simon said he knew he
had paid state taxes last year but just lacked "the precise numbers"
when reporters questioned him.</TE>
<TE>   "I did pay taxes both in California and federally--and in some
other states where it was appropriate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to name the other states.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts to tamp down discussion of his taxes were temporarily
thwarted, however, when he was asked Friday whether he had paid
California income taxes every year since he moved to the state from
New Jersey in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have all my tax returns with me, and I don't carry them
around with me," he said. "I can't necessarily tell you what was on
the tax returns over a 10-year time frame when you just give me that
question, not having known that it might be coming."</TE>
<TE>   Fisfis said later that the campaign checked with Simon's
accountants in New Jersey and confirmed the candidate had paid
California income taxes every year since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate's earlier inability to say for sure drew a new round
of criticism from the Davis reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me he's having trouble recalling what his own
finances are," said Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar. "If he
can't keep track of his own finances, how does he expect to keep
track of California's $100-billion budgets?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon said a finance disclosure report he was required by law to
file in December already offered "a very exhaustive and extensive
look at pretty much everything to do with my finances."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a matter of hiding anything," he said. "It's really more
a matter of--we're on a campaign, and we're trying to talk about our
message. And we want to try to make sure that we're receptive to
questions as best as we can. But at some point you say, 'Enough is
enough.'"</TE>
<TE>   In the disclosure report, Simon listed scores of trusts,
partnerships and corporations as assets or sources of income. In some
areas, the 128-page report contains more information than might be
found on a tax return, but in others it offers less.</TE>
<TE>   Though candidates for statewide office are required to file the
reports, they list ranges of income, not precise amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some stock sales, for example, are reported as income in the
category of "over $100,000." Among the sales in that category are
shares of Allied Waste Industries Inc., a garbage hauler, and Hanover
Compressor Co., an energy exploration company.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates are not legally required to release their tax returns,
but voluntary disclosure has become routine. President Bush and Vice
President Dick Cheney have released their tax returns, and Davis
disclosed his on Monday. Former Govs. Pete Wilson and George
Deukmejian also released theirs when they were in office. Simon said
Monday that he requested an extension for filing his 2001 tax returns
because his finances were so complex that he "could not be reasonably
expected" to file his returns by April 15.</TE>
<TE>   The tax returns issue has been a weeklong distraction for Simon.
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) chatted briefly with Simon
at the campaign event in Anaheim, a fund-raiser for Rep. Ed Royce
(R-Fullerton). Rohrabacher asked Simon in jest, "What's this about
you not paying taxes?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon responded, "This is crazy," Rohrabacher said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake View Terrace woman was being held Friday on suspicion of
attempted murder after she allegedly slashed her 5-year-old son's
wrists with a razor blade and then cut her own.</LD>
<LD>   Bernadette Marks, 37, was spotted by neighbors at 12:25 p.m.
walking along the sidewalk in the 11600 block of Kismet Avenue,
bloodied and carrying her son in her arms, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   "They were both bleeding badly," Officer Don Cox said. "It
appeared the boy was more severely injured than the mother."</LD>
<TE>   Marks was treated at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center and
transferred to Twin Towers jail, where she is being held in lieu of
$1-million bail. Her son was in stable condition late Friday at
Childrens Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Marks had a history of mental problems.</TE>

<HD>CSUN Program Gets Nod</HD>
<DH>Education: School is tapped to craft training courses for
teachers nationwide. A grant of $5 million is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Carnegie Corp. of New York has asked Cal State Northridge and
three other universities to take part in a landmark initiative to
create model teaching programs across the country.</LD>
<LD>   CSUN, the largest producer of teachers in the state, is expected
to qualify for a $5-million teaching grant in the next few months,
university officials said. The chancellor's office of the 23-school
California State University system will match the grant over the next
five years.</LD>
<LD>   "If we are looking for models, [CSUN] could be a good model for
other state institutions," said Susan King, a spokeswoman for the
Carnegie Corp., the New York-based philanthropic and educational
organization founded by steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie.</LD>
<TE>   The Bank Street College of Education in New York City, Michigan
State University and the University of Virginia will also participate
in the "Teachers for a New Era" initiative.</TE>
<TE>   CSUN was tapped, said university President Jolene Koester, because
of its nationwide reputation for educating quality teachers. With
1,600 budding educators graduating a year, the school represents the
single biggest source of new teacher talent in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The university has a long commitment to teacher preparation,"
Koester said. "We have entered in many partnerships with the local
school districts. We have been involved in many innovative programs.
And we have an all-university commitment. I think that's what
Carnegie saw in Cal State Northridge."</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Corp. officials said they sought education programs that
could show collaboration with other disciplines and had strong
support from administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Rusche, dean of CSUN's College of Education, said the
school epitomizes the kind of teamwork that Carnegie looked for.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly view teacher education as a university-wide
enterprise," Rusche said.</TE>

<HD>Urich Recalled as Actor and Friend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of friends and celebrities mourned TV star Robert Urich on
Friday as a down-to-earth actor who never let success go to his head.</LD>
<LD>   Urich died Tuesday at the age of 55 after a long battle with
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Actors Tony Danza, Gavin MacLeod and Tom Selleck joined the nearly
1,000 mourners at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in North
Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   "It's sad because of who Bob is and was. You see the friends he
had, real friends. It's not just show business, it's true friendship
that brings these kind of people out," Selleck told reporters outside
the church.</TE>
<TE>   A framed black-and-white photograph of the actor was positioned
outside the church amid an array of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   During his 30-year TV career, Urich was best-known for playing
private investigators in "Vega$" and "Spenser: For Hire" and a
luckless cowboy in "Lonesome Dove."</TE>
<TE>   His death came one day after the debut of the television movie
"Night of the Wolf," in which Urich co-starred as a ranch foreman.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his first TV role in the 1973 comedy series "Bob &amp; Carol
&amp; Ted &amp; Alice." He also appeared in the TV series "S.W.A.T." before
being cast as Peter Campbell in "Soap."</TE>
<TE>   Other TV credits include "Crossroads," "Vital Signs," "It Had to
Be You" and "The Love Boat: The Next Wave."</TE>
<TE>   Among his film roles were appearances in "Turk 182!" with Timothy
Hutton, and in "Ice Pirates" with Anjelica Huston.</TE>
<TE>   After being diagnosed with cancer, Urich became active in cancer
research. He and his wife established the Heather and Robert Urich
Fund for Sarcoma Research.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County officials are recommending that a revamped child
support collections office be headed by Stan Trom, the same man who
ran the district attorney's child-support division for 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said Trom is "thoroughly
knowledgeable" about child-support issues and would make a
well-qualified leader. Trom would oversee a newly created county
department that oversees more than $50 million in child-support
payments each year.</LD>
<LD>   Criticism over local district attorneys' handling of collection
duties prompted legislators to create a new state-supervised system
to do the job. Counties are charged with administering the programs
locally.</LD>

<LD>A former gang member told a jury Friday that he saw murder suspect
Ramiro Salgado hit Ventura resident William Zara with a shovel during
a fight in September 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Salgado, 22, is accused of participating in the beating death of
Zara, who was bludgeoned outside his apartment by gang members who
mistakenly thought he had reported their noisy party to police.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, 25-year-old Chris Gonzales, a former Ventura gang
member, testified that during the fight he saw Salgado strike a young
man, later identified as Zara, with a shovel.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales was initially charged with murder, but the charges were
set aside after he agreed to enter a witness protection program and
testify against fellow gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Four co-defendants arrested before police uncovered evidence of
Salgado's alleged involvement were convicted of murder last year and
are serving life sentences.</TE>

<HD>2 More Women Accuse Police Officer of Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two more women have accused a San Bernardino police officer, already
charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting 11 other victims
while on duty, of assaulting them, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Arraignment for Officer Ronald VanRossum on more than two dozen
felony counts, including rape and kidnapping, was postponed Friday
until June 17 to give his attorney more time to review the evidence.</LD>
<LD>   VanRossum, 37, alternately described as a rogue officer and a
Little League father, has been in custody on $2-million bond since
his arrest March 28. He did not appear in court Friday.</LD>
<TE>   His attorney, William Hadden, could not be reached for comment
Friday, but said earlier that his client is not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say the officer, a 14-year veteran of the
department, targeted low-income women, some of them prostitutes and
drug addicts, between April 2000 and November 2001 while working
night patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The case came to light in November when a woman arrested on an
outstanding warrant told authorities that VanRossum had once driven
her to a remote location and raped her while on duty. VanRossum was
placed on leave while officers investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Police recently turned the names of two additional victims over to
the San Bernardino County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Mickey, a spokeswoman for the district attorney, said no
additional charges have been filed, and she did not know if more are
forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, Judge W. Robert Fawke extended a ban on publishing
VanRossum's picture.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times and the Riverside Press-Enterprise
photographed the officer March 29 with Fawke's permission, but after
lawyers on both sides objected, the judge said the pictures could not
be published.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the newspapers have asked appellate judges to overturn
that decision. Friday was the last day for the district attorney and
the Superior Court to file opposition to the newspapers' request.</TE>

<HD>Wahoo McDaniel, 63; Football Player Became Popular Wrestler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Wahoo McDaniel, the former pro football player who became one of pro
wrestling's most flamboyant figures, has died of complications from
renal failure and diabetes. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   McDaniel, who lost both of his kidneys about 4 1/2 years ago, died
Thursday night at Cy-Fair Medical Clinic in Houston, his oldest
daughter said. He had been in failing health in recent years, often
undergoing kidney dialysis, and was on a waiting list to receive a
kidney transplant.</LD>
<LD>   McDaniel was born in Bernice, La., on June 19, 1938, and was a
football star at Midland High School in Texas in the 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   He moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where he lettered at
linebacker from 1957-59. He holds the school record for the longest
punt with a 91-yarder against Iowa State in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wild, crazy Indian," daughter Nicky Rowe said Friday.
"He was bigger than life. He was just amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-11, 280-pound McDaniel was selected by Los Angeles in
the second round of the American Football League draft in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   He bounced around the AFL for much of his eight-year career,
spending time with the Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, New York Jets
and, finally, the Miami Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of his football career, McDaniel had already
established himself as a name in minor-league wrestling circuits
around the country. But as a Jet, he began to headline wrestling
events at Madison Square Garden with the help of the arena's owner,
Sonny Werblin. Werblin also was involved in the ownership of the
Jets.</TE>
<TE>   McDaniel capitalized on the stardom from his gridiron days and
made a smooth transition into wrestling full time. He became one of
the country's most popular and beloved wrestlers during the 1960s,
'70s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the first to make the transition from football to
wrestling," said Bob Ryder, who operates the wrestling Web site
1wrestling.com. "When he found out he was making more money as a
wrestler than a football player, he gave up football. He was such a
big star."</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of his 30-year wrestling career, McDaniel had
memorable battles with wrestling stars such as "Nature Boy" Ric
Flair, "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter. He won several titles
before retiring in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrestled all the top wrestlers in the world, and I traveled a
lot," McDaniel once said. "I got to see a lot of places that I
probably wouldn't have gotten to see."</TE>
<TE>   He was also fiercely proud of his Chickasaw Indian heritage and
always entered the ring with his elaborate trademark feathered
headdress.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he retired, health problems limited McDaniel to one
of his newfound passions--golf. He made his home in Charlotte, N.C.,
until recently, but moved to Houston to live with his daughter and
son-in-law as his health began to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   "He also became a mentor to a lot of other wrestlers," Rowe said.
"He was so famous, I just didn't realize it until now. We've got so
many calls from people."</TE>
<TE>   Rowe said the family plans to scatter McDaniel's ashes over a lake
near Del Rio, Texas, that was once the favorite fishing spot of her
father and grandfather. They plan a memorial service in Midland next
week.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Rowe, McDaniel is survived by another daughter and
a son.</TE>

<HD>Man Builds a Welcome Addition to Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Volunteerism: Highland Avenue offramp gets a citizen
makeover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Ginn used to get angry every time he drove past the trash dumped
next to one of the main gateways to Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Old mattresses, broken shopping carts and piles of rubbish were
strewn in the weeds alongside the Highland Avenue exit from the
Hollywood Freeway. The dumping ground was a no-man's land created by
the three-way boundary of city, county and state property, and nobody
seemed interested in claiming responsibility for cleaning it.</LD>
<LD>   So the Hollywood Bowl groundskeeper cut through four layers of red
tape and built his own do-it-yourself entryway into Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   He planted native oak saplings and toyon plants where the trash
had accumulated. And to make the site more hospitable, he constructed
his own 63-square-foot "Welcome to Hollywood" sign in the middle of
it all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our front door. It should be a welcome mat," Ginn said
Friday. "I'd be embarrassed every time I got off the Hollywood
Freeway. That offramp seemed to catch it."</TE>
<TE>   The site is important because international visitors staying at a
nearby Cahuenga Pass youth hostel walk past it on their way into
Hollywood. And San Fernando Valley concert-goers headed for the
Hollywood Bowl get an eyeful when they pass by in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Ginn, 57, is grounds maintenance supervisor at the Bowl, where he
has worked for 16 years. He enlisted a friend, Sal Barcenas, to help
with the cleanup. Barcenas directs a crew of minor offenders who, as
part of their sentences, do maintenance work for the Los Angeles
County Department of Parks and Recreation in the vicinity of the
Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   A wall that helps form a walkway beneath the offramp was used as
the base of Ginn's welcome sign. At first, he considered painting a
mural on it. But the 8-foot wall was too small.</TE>
<TE>   Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce,
agreed to let Ginn use the stylized lettering from the famous
Hollywood sign without paying the usual licensing fee.</TE>
<TE>   It took six months after that to get the approval of state, county
and city officials for the project. Once those hurdles were cleared,
Ginn purchased a postcard of the Hollywood sign and sketched out his
welcome sign. He scrounged scrap marble floor tiles and Barcenas
helped him form them into the sign's letters.</TE>
<TE>   The white lettering jumps out at passersby from the finished
sign's black background. Since being installed two weeks ago, it's
gotten rave reviews from offramp motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good addition to the area," said Wendy Lord, who manages
the Hollywood Bungalows youth hostel near the sign. "It's a nice
welcome for visitors."</TE>
<TE>   Ginn, who lives in Arcadia, said the landscaping he created in the
offramp area may soon spread to some other undeveloped hillside areas
near the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Besides improving the looks, the new vegetation will eventually
cut down the brush fire danger, he said.</TE>

<LD>Garcetti garage--The Patt Morrison column in Wednesday's California
section said that in the 1980s, then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was ordered
to tear down part of a garage built too close to the property line. After
issuing that order, however, the city ruled that it had erred and had
given Garcetti a permit for the garage. As a result, the city relented on
its order and granted Garcetti a variance to let the garage remain as
built.</LD>

<HD>Gagne Saves Night Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After another strong effort by Nomo, closer gets
seventh save in as many chances in 5-2 victory over Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Gagne is perfectly happy as the Dodger closer.</LD>
<LD>   And why not?</LD>
<LD>   The converted starter has made 10 appearances this season and has
yet to give up a run.</LD>
<TE>   Gagne turned in what has become a typical performance Friday night
at Dodger Stadium, slamming the door on the San Diego Padres in a 5-2
victory before 47,425.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne struck out Phil Nevin with two runners on in the eighth and
pitched a perfect ninth as the Dodgers (10-7) won their third game in
a row. He has seven saves in seven opportunities, has not given up a
run in 11 innings and has retired the last 15 batters he has faced.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to throw a lot of strikes early and get ahead in the
count," said Gagne, who entered the game in the eighth inning for the
first time this season. "What helps is that I throw all my pitches
for strikes. You can't sit on one pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne preserved the victory for Hideo Nomo (2-2), the No. 2
starter in a rotation that began the game having held the opposition
to a .214 batting average, the lowest mark in the National League.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up two runs, four hits and struck out five in 71/3
innings as a Dodger starter gave up two earned runs or fewer for the
12th time in the last 14 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like a broken record," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Our
pitching staff is carrying us."</TE>
<TE>   Several players helped carry the offensive load against Brian
Lawrence (2-1), who had pitched 16 consecutive scoreless innings,
including seven in a 1-0 victory over the Dodgers and Nomo last
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hansen, who played first base in place of Eric Karros, drove
in two runs with a single in the first inning and a sacrifice fly in
the eighth. Dave Roberts scored a run in the first and had a
run-scoring single in the fourth, Brian Jordan tripled in an
insurance run in the eighth and Shawn Green had two doubles and
scored a run.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Gagne who ensured victory when he came on in relief of
Paul Quantrill with two out in the eighth after D'Angelo Jimenez
drove in Ramon Vasquez with a double to make the score 3-2 and Mark
Kotsay walked.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne struck out Nevin to end the threat, then retired Ryan
Klesko, Ron Gant and Sean Burroughs in the ninth to preserve the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to get ahead [on the count] on a guy like that," Nevin
said. "I just didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive game, the Dodgers scored in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff batter Roberts was hit by a pitch and Cesar Izturis
followed with a single to left before Lo Duca sacrificed.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence issued an intentional walk to Green to load the bases
bringing up Jordan, who hit a ground ball that forced rookie third
baseman Burroughs to dive to his left. Burroughs got the force at
second, but Jordan beat Jimenez' throw to first to give the Dodgers a
1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen followed with a shot toward the mound that bounced off the
rubber and rolled to the outfield for a run-scoring single and 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers increased the margin to 3-0 in the fourth inning.
Adrian Beltre hit a fly ball to left that cleared the fence, but left
fielder Gant leaped and brought it back into the park. Beltre wound
up with a triple.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre was thrown out at the plate on Mark Grudzielanek's ground
ball to second, but Nomo walked and Grudzielanek scored on a single
by Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres pulled to within 3-1 in the fifth when Burroughs hit
his first career homer into the right-field pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo was replaced by Quantrill in the eighth after giving up a
lead-off single to Vasquez and getting Tom Lampkin to pop out to
Beltre. Quantrill struck out pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney, but Jimenez
was credited with a run-scoring double when he hit a ball off home
plate that bounced into left field to make it 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   One batter later, Gagne entered the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets what he's doing out there and he's gotten it very
quickly," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "And he's very effective at
doing it."</TE>

<LD>Forty years ago, Oscar Robertson put together a season unique in NBA
history.</LD>
<LD>   You want numbers? Peep the Big O's stats from 1961-62: 30.8
points, 12.5 rebounds, 11.4 assists a game.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, he averaged a triple-double.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that's still the most unbelievable thing I've heard of,
along with Wilt's 100 points," Magic Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   You hear triple-double, you probably think of Magic. That's kind
of like Elvis Presley and rock 'n' roll; he's the guy who popularized
it, not the one who originated the style.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson produced 138 triple-doubles in his career. They call him
the NBA's all-time leader. Like "blocked shots," which were not kept
as official statistics until 1973-74--after Bill Russell and Wilt
Chamberlain's years of controlling the paint--the triple-double is a
category that will always be skewed.</TE>
<TE>   The term "triple-double" was coined by Bruce Jolesch, the former
Laker public relations director who needed a way to summarize
Johnson's penchant for recording double figures in points, rebounds
and assists.</TE>
<TE>   If they'd bothered to keep track back when Oscar played, he would
have put the number off the charts. He was just three-tenths of an
assist here, one-tenth of a rebound there from averaging a
triple-double in each of his first four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In his rookie year with the Cincinnati Royals in 1960-61, he
averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists. In 1962-63, he
averaged 28.3 points 10.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists. In 1963-64: 31.4
points, 9.9 rebounds and 11 assists. When you add up the numbers and
divide them over his 309 games, Robertson's averages for his first
four seasons come out to 30.2 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists.</TE>
<TE>   To Robertson, it was just about playing basketball, not posting
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought everybody played the same way," Robertson said. "I was
just trying to win. You did what you could to win. We didn't have a
great basketball team, didn't have great forwards."</TE>
<TE>   That's where his emphasis on rebounding came in. And considering
some of the centers he had to fight to get those boards, it's what he
considers the most impressive about his triple-doubles.</TE>
<TE>   "When I [started playing in the NBA], they only had eight
basketball teams," Robertson said. "You had Russell,
Chamberlain--Nate Thurmond came on later--really great inside
presence on rebounds. I think my feat was special, looking back on
it."</TE>
<TE>   The assists came from reading the game.</TE>
<TE>   "As a guard, you try to probe," Robertson said. "If you play
against someone and your man has got a mismatch, you keep going to
it. When I played, you kept going to someone till he missed."</TE>
<TE>   And while handling all the little things, he still finished among
the top three scorers in the league in each of his first seven
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "When I played, I'm averaging 30 points per game, as well as the
assists and rebounds," Robertson said. "Today if they get 10 points,
they think it's the coming of Jesus. If I'd averaged 10 points and 10
assists and rebounds, they wouldn't have said much about it."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Net guard Jason Kidd is a leading candidate for most
valuable player, in part because he led the NBA in triple-doubles.</TE>
<TE>   He had eight.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about it--a triple-double every night," Johnson
marveled. "My little ones that I accomplished were hard enough. It's
just amazing. I don't think he gets enough credit for that."</TE>
<TE>   Those who played against him know better. Mentioning Robertson's
name at the gathering of Minneapolis and L.A. Laker greats last week
set the praise flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "Oscar amazed me every time he played," said Clyde Lovellette.
"Because he was a great ballplayer. You can't mention any guard
without mentioning Oscar, because he was a super player.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about the double-doubles and the triple-triples, but
he came to play every game," Lovellette added. "He was on the court
40 minutes, 48 minutes, and he'd give you 100% all the time. He was
just a great individual, great ballplayer. He'd rank right up among
the top players today at his position."</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 5, Robertson redefined the guard position. Without him,
you wouldn't have 6-9 guys like Johnson bringing the ball up, or
guards operating in the low post. (Another thing they had in common:
both won championships with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Robertson got his in
Milwaukee in 1970-71).</TE>
<TE>   Although he was Johnson's forerunner, "They didn't play the game
at all alike," said Jerry West, the former Laker guard and later
executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "[Johnson] played the game with a flair, a completely different
kind of game. Oscar looked more methodical. He just ground people
down. He had a great instinct to do the kind of things that made him
great.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a great player. He could do everything. He really
didn't have any weaknesses in his game. When he was born, they
sprinkled some extra dust on him."</TE>
<TE>   In today's players, Robertson sees some elements of his style in
Kidd and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Among the rest, however ...</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these players seem like they've never touched a
basketball," he said. "Coming down, taking a long jump shot every
time is not playing basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The man who set the NBA assists record--surpassed by Johnson and
then John Stockton--can still dish out opinions on any number of
topics.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks that college athletes would get into less trouble if
they had to stay on campus, that the NFL does a better job than any
other sport when it comes to honoring its past heroes, that athletic
shoe companies should market to more people than those 18-24, and
that corporate America is too skewed toward the big companies.</TE>
<TE>   That last opinion was ventured while discussing the chemical,
sanitation management and corrugated packaging companies he runs.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, 63, still attends games at Cincinnati, where he was a
three-time national college player of the year and led the Bearcats
to the Final Four twice.</TE>
<TE>   He'll tune in to watch a few NBA teams on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the Lakers, Sacramento, San Antonio," Robertson said. "I
like to watch Minnesota sometimes. Some teams I don't want to watch,
they're not worth mentioning. I don't think they're very competitive.
The organizations have not done a good job selecting [players]."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's philosophy is that the game is won from the free-throw
line and below. He said the Detroit Pistons understand the concept,
which is why they're winning, even though they don't have any "star"
players besides Jerry Stackhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years after Robertson's landmark achievement, there were 29
triple-doubles posted this season. In 1961-62, that was just an
average couple of months for Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Although, when you think about it, there was nothing average about
it.</TE>

Doubling Up
When Oscar Robertson, right, joined the
Cincinnati Royals in 1960, the term
"triple-double" wasn't in use in the
NBA. Robertson was ahead of his time:
through his first four pro seasons he
was averaging a triple-double:

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in a long while, Pedro Martinez was dominant.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez pitched one-hit ball for eight innings, and Shea
Hillenbrand had a bases-loaded triple to lead the Boston Red Sox over
the Kansas City Royals, 4-0, at Kansas City, Mo., on Friday night for
their fourth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez (2-0) struck out six and walked none, lowering his
earned-run average from 6.91 to 4.43. He gave up only a clean single
to Mike Sweeney in the fourth and ended the inning by striking out
Michael Tucker for his 2,000th career strikeout.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a huge milestone," Martinez said. "It's something to be
proud of. A lot of people doubted if I could pitch five innings
[early in my career]. It is pretty much the same as the first time I
won 20 games."</TE>
<TE>   Rich Garces pitched the ninth, giving up Neifi Perez's two-out
single, to complete Boston's second shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who retired his last 13 batters, joins seven other
active pitchers with 2,000 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Toronto 5--Gerald Williams threw out the go-ahead run
at the plate in the top of the ninth and scored the winning run in
the bottom half as the Yankees bailed out Mariano Rivera and won at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who came on as a defensive replacement in the ninth,
caught Raul Mondesi's fly ball to right and threw out Homer Bush at
the plate, keeping the game tied at 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Williams sparked the winning rally by walking against Bob File
(0-1), moving to second on a sacrifice and scoring on Alfonso
Soriano's single.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 12, Cleveland 3--Kyle Lohse (1-1) pitched seven strong
innings and Tom Prince homered twice to lead the Twins at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Losers of 14 of 19 to the Indians last season and swept in a
four-game series last week in Cleveland, the Twins scored four in the
fourth inning and six in the fifth to build an 11-0 lead. Cleveland
has lost four in a row after starting the season 11-1.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 8, Chicago 2--Randall Simon tied his career high with four
hits, and Oscar Salazar hit his first major league home run to lead
the Tigers at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sparks (1-1), backed by a 5-0 lead in the second, gave up
five hits in eight innings, and Mike Rivera drove in two runs for the
Tigers, who have won three of four after an 0-11 start.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Seattle 0--At Seattle, the Rangers ended the Mariners'
10-game winning streak as Rafael Palmeiro hit his 450th career homer
and Kenny Rogers pitched his first shutout in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Tampa Bay 5--Brook Fordyce drove in the go-ahead run
with a squeeze bunt in the 14th inning as the Orioles defeated the
Devil Rays at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Erstad Has Unhappy Landing in Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Center fielder suffers a possible head injury and
is taken to hospital, putting a damper on the Angels' 9-7 win at
Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels could not cheer. On the rare night when the hitters
carried the team, the Angels' thoughts were with Darin Erstad, their
center fielder and team leader.</LD>
<LD>   As the players headed onto the field for the postgame handshake,
presumably relieved after the pitching staff blew all but two runs of
an eight-run lead, they awaited word on the condition of Erstad,
taken to a local hospital for tests after possibly suffering a head
injury while trying to make a diving catch.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels posted season highs in runs, hits and walks in a 9-7
victory over the Oakland Athletics Friday. Bengie Molina drove in
three runs and had three of the Angels' 12 hits. The Angels blew most
of a 9-1 lead and gave up four runs in the bottom of the ninth before
Troy Percival, fresh off a two-week stay on the disabled list,
recorded his first save since April 2, throwing as hard as 98 mph.</LD>
<TE>   Erstad was taken for X-rays and a CT scan of his head and neck,
which came back negative, according to Allan Pont, the A's team
physician. Pont examined Erstad after he left the game and found him
to be "lightheaded" and "a little groggy," with concern about a
concussion or other residual effect from a play Tuesday in which
Erstad slammed his head into the outfield fence at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than celebrate his save, Percival dressed hurriedly to go
visit Erstad at the hospital, where the outfielder was expected to
remain overnight for observation.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad left the game an inning after diving for a line drive hit
by Carlos Pena in the third. Erstad did not make the catch but landed
hard on the ground--hitting his chin, Pont said, and perhaps jarring
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad batted in the fourth inning, then was replaced by Jeff
DaVanon. After a clubhouse examination by Pont, Erstad was taken to
the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough for him to focus," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"His equilibrium was a little bit off.... He obviously was in no
condition to play a ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's body took a beating during Tuesday's game, in which he
slammed his head into the outfield fence, breaking his fall with his
arms, and later dived for two other balls. Erstad was cleared to play
Wednesday after undergoing tests, and Pont said Angel trainers have
kept Erstad under close observation since then.</TE>
<TE>   Percival said he spoke briefly with Erstad in the clubhouse before
he was taken to the hospital. "I just told him to hang on tight,"
Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   The game featured a nice display of the offensive diversity the
Angels promised this spring. They did not hit a home run, but the
highlights were many and varied.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer dived into first base to beat out an infield single
and later stole a base. Adam Kennedy dropped a bunt single. Tim
Salmon did not get a hit, but he drew two of the Angels' five walks.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who had not driven in a run this season, drove in two.
Troy Glaus singled to end an 0-for-21 skid. Fullmer scored twice, as
did Scott Spiezio. Kennedy, Garret Anderson and David Eckstein each
had two hits.</TE>
<TE>   By the fifth inning, the Angels led by five runs, their largest
lead of the season. They extended the lead to eight runs before the
A's chased Jarrod Washburn by scoring twice in the seventh inning.
Washburn, who held Oakland to one run over the first six innings,
earned his first victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels displayed ample offensive creativity in the third
inning, when they scored four runs, and in the fifth, when they
scored two more on one hit, one hit batsman and two walks.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, the Angels put the first three runners on
base, the first time they had done so in any inning in nine days.
Scioscia twice used the hit-and-run, a prelude to RBI singles by
Kennedy and Fullmer and a two-run double by Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the win, the Angels are 6-10 and 61/2 games out of first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a serious uphill climb," Erstad said before the
game. "But I truly believe we're going to hit. We're going to score
runs."</TE>
<TE>   They did Friday, without him. Whether they can do it without him
for an extended period, if necessary, is another question.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>A Striking Pattern for Hitters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>In spring training, the Angels emphasized that their hitters needed
to work the count, take more pitches and take more walks. The Angels
began Friday's game ranked last in the major leagues in walks and
on-base percentage, and batting coach Mickey Hatcher wonders if his
hitters are so worried about taking pitches that they are letting the
most hittable ones go by.</LD>
<LD>   As opposing pitchers suspect the Angel hitters might be prone to
taking a pitch, Hatcher says, they might leave a first-pitch fastball
over the plate. Too often, Hatcher says, the hitter takes the strike,
falls behind in the count and makes an out.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't take a first-pitch batting-practice fastball at 88 mph,"
Hatcher said. "We're not a good two-strike hitting team. I don't want
them going up there and giving up pitches they should hit. You might
only get one good pitch to hit in an at-bat, and they've got to be
ready to hit it."</LD>
<TE>   The remedy, of course, is for the Angels to start hitting, so that
pitchers fear putting that first pitch over the plate. The Angels
began play Friday hitting .220; they hit 16 fly balls for outs
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hit 16 fly balls and expect to win the game," Hatcher
said. "I told them, get your mind off your average and let's make
some adjustments. I don't see adjustments being made. We've got a lot
of guys who work hard, but there's a difference between working hard
and applying it in the game, and that's what is not happening."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of results has bred a crisis of confidence among the
hitters, Hatcher said.</TE>
<TE>   "The confidence level of a lot of guys is down," he said. "We're
trying to build it up. It's tough to see what's happening. A lot of
it is mind-boggling to me. We don't see the confident approach we saw
in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One day after benching right fielder Tim Salmon and suggesting he
could miss a few games, Manager Mike Scioscia returned him to the
lineup, batting seventh. Salmon began play Friday hitting .143.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ultimate goal is to get Tim Salmon productive.... It's hard
to be productive unless you have a chance to get at-bats," Scioscia
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a case where Tim will come in every day and wonder
whether he's playing. We're not going to pull the plug on a guy 40
at-bats into the season. If he starts swinging the bat well, that's
not going to be an issue. If there's a prolonged production shortage,
we're going to mix and match."</TE>

<HD>A Night of Firsts for the Avengers</HD>
<DH>Pro football: L.A. scores early and often in defeating New
York, 43-25, in opener before 13,142 at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Avengers accomplished something Friday night that they were
unable to do in their first two seasons in the Arena Football League.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time the Avengers (1-0) have been above .500.</LD>
<LD>   A 43-25 victory over the New York Dragons before 13,142 at Staples
Center was the kind of win the team has sought to build interest in
the team.</LD>
<TE>   Wide receiver Chris Jackson, who has switched from being a two-way
player to an offensive specialist, had a game to remember.</TE>
<TE>   The former basketball standout at Santa Ana Mater Dei High who
turned to football at Washington State, tied a team record with five
touchdowns. Four came on receptions, the last one being 19 yards to
give the Avengers a 40-18 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The four touchdown receptions were a career high for Jackson, who
also had a career high in receptions with 12, good for 145 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting the victory was the most important thing," Jackson said.
"Any one of the wide receivers can have a big night in this system.
Tonight was just my night."</TE>
<TE>   It was also a successful starting debut for quarterback Tony
Graziani, who played in two games last season as a backup. Graziani
completed 26 of 39 passes for 273 yards. He threw four touchdown
passes and ran for another score.</TE>
<TE>   Benefiting from the efforts of Jackson and Graziani was Ed
Hodgkiss, who won his first game as an Avenger coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers showed other signs this could be a turnaround season.</TE>
<TE>   Defensively, they exploited the inexperience of Dragon quarterback
Danny Ragsdale. The former University of Redlands standout, making
his first Arena start after spending last year as a backup to Aaron
Garcia (now in the NFL with the 49ers), was sacked four times and
intercepted by Avenger defensive back Derek Grier. He passed for 129
yards, completing 13 of 24 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The 25 points scored by New York were the fewest ever by an
Avenger opponent. Last year, Los Angeles held Oklahoma to 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably more impressed with the defense tonight," Hodgkiss
said. "Our linemen got a lot of pressure on [Ragsdale]. The secondary
was able to play a lot of man coverage, and they were lined up
against some pretty good receivers."</TE>
<TE>   The schedule gets more challenging for the Avengers. L.A. must go
on the road to play Arizona, Dallas and defending Western Division
champion San Jose before returning home to face Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   All but Dallas, an expansion team, made the playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson started his big game with a 15-yard touchdown reception on
the Avengers' second play.</TE>
<TE>   His second touchdown came on a two-yard run late in the first
quarter. And Jackson continued to torment the Dragon secondary with
two more touchdown passes from Graziani, each covering 14 yards.</TE>
<TE>   As the half ended Jackson already had seven receptions for 89
yards. Graziani threw for 158 yards in the half, completing 13 of 20.</TE>
<TE>   But Graziani also had a couple of turnovers that helped the
Dragons stay in the game.</TE>

<LD>Gary Sheffield was held out of the lineup for the third consecutive
game Friday night as the Atlanta Braves' right fielder nurses a
sprained left wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield, who was not available for comment, took a cortisone
shot Thursday. He was hit by pitches twice at Philadelphia on April
11.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield, a former Dodger, is batting .263 with three homers and
nine runs batted in. He is hitless in his last 11 at-bats.</LD>

<KH>BOXING STEVE SPRINGER</KH>
<HD>For Mayweather, Dollars Aren't Making Sense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Once the dominating figure in boxing, Mike Tyson coasts for a decade,
staging one freak show after another. He spends time behind bars for
rape and road rage convictions, bites off a piece of one man's ear,
allegedly bites another on the thigh and chews out nearly everyone
who dares approach him with vicious, vulgar language. And still he
remains a huge attraction, big enough to earn $17.5 million for his
June 8 heavyweight title match against Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar De La Hoya loses to his two biggest opponents, takes nine
months off to launch a singing career, engages in a nasty,
name-calling legal battle with promoter Bob Arum, returns to fight
two badly overmatched opponents and still remains an attraction. His
Sept. 14 fight against Fernando Vargas will earn De La Hoya a minimum
of $14 million.</LD>
<LD>   All of which leaves Floyd Mayweather Jr. confused and frustrated.
Where's his adulation? Where are his million pay-per-view buys? Where
is his Oscar money?</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a star, but I want to be a megastar," said Mayweather, who
has moved up to the 135-pound division to challenge World Boxing
Council lightweight champion Jose Luis Castillo tonight at the MGM
Grand Garden Arena. "I want my face out there more. I want to become
a household name. I was promised I was going to be as big as life."</TE>
<TE>   Those promises, Mayweather said, were made by his promoter, Arum.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to be promoted a lot more," Mayweather said.</TE>
<TE>   He sees no other reason why it is not his face adorning billboards
and magazine covers, his signature on contracts for lucrative
endorsement deals, his name popping up in arguments about the best
fighter, pound for pound.</TE>
<TE>   To augment his argument, he can point to his skills, which include
dazzling speed and more-than adequate power. He can mention his
record, 27-0 with 20 knockouts. He can produce an impressive list of
opponents, which include Genaro Hernandez, Angel Manfredy and Diego
Corrales. He can boast about winning the WBC 130-pound title at age
21 and successfully defending it eight times.</TE>
<TE>   His talent has not been overlooked by knowledgeable boxing people.
Even though he is moving up in weight to take on a tough veteran who
has a 45-4-1 record with 41 knockouts, Mayweather is a 4-1 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Yet an attraction he is not. Ticket sales for tonight are so
sluggish that Arum predicts only 5,000 will be sold. So although
Mayweather will make $2.2 million for this fight--double that of his
opponent--his dream of Oscar money remains just that, a dream.</TE>
<TE>   What's the problem? There are several.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mayweather remains undefeated, his ring performance is
not unblemished. He has been troubled by pain in his hands that has
often forced him to hold back. And his physical limitations have
sometimes been matched by a lack of mental sharpness. A defensive
counterpuncher who shies away from aggressiveness, he seems to fight
down to the level of lesser opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a couple of stinkers," he conceded, "but I've had a lot
more good ones."</TE>
<TE>   Ugly performances in the ring have been matched by ugliness
outside the ropes. A feud with his father, Floyd Mayweather Sr., who
also served as his manager and trainer, resulted in a breakup of
their relationship. At issue was Junior's decision to replace his
father as manager with rap-music producer James Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Junior wound up looking like the bad guy when he evicted his
father from the residence Junior had paid for.</TE>
<TE>   Senior's brother, Roger Mayweather, replaced him as trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "Not having his father has hurt his performances," Arum said. "I
really believe that. It's not that Roger is not a good trainer. It's
just that he doesn't have the control over Floyd."</TE>
<TE>   In or out of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather pleaded to domestic violence charges last month and was
given a six-month suspended sentence and two days of house arrest.
The incidents involved two women who have had children with him.</TE>
<TE>   It also didn't help Mayweather's image when he initially rejected
a six-fight, $12.75-million offer from HBO, labeling the money "slave
wages."</TE>
<TE>   But all that is behind him and so too, promises Mayweather, will
be Castillo after tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather weighed in at 134 pounds Friday, Castillo at 1341/2.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a brick chin," said Mayweather, "and I ain't going
anywhere. I was knocking people out as a featherweight. Imagine me
now hitting like a welterweight."</TE>
<TE>   Mystery Guest</TE>
<TE>   All Jim Brown was told was that a minister had come to see him.</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Fame running back had fallen on lean times. Literally.
Sentenced to six months in a Ventura County jail for smashing the
window of a car belonging to his wife, Monique, Brown had gone on a
hunger strike.</TE>
<TE>   But when he saw who the minister was, a big smile crossed Brown's
face.</TE>
<TE>   "Big George," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was George Foreman, the former two-time heavyweight champion
who is now a Houston minister.</TE>
<TE>   "I surprised him," said Foreman, whose friendship with Brown
stretches to the mid-1970s. "I don't get into who did what. I know,
deep down, Jim is a good person.</TE>
<TE>   "He was shocked to see me and that is the best kind of visit."</TE>
<TE>   According to Foreman, Brown has turned to religion.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he has been reading the Bible," Foreman said, "and now
his blood pressure is down and his cholesterol level is better. I
told him maybe he should pay the county for being there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sad when I had to go. You look at that soundproof cell and
you hate to leave a friend there."</TE>

<LD>Tired of seeing Tiger Woods dominate the links? Looking for that
certain someone to bring him back to the pack and make golf a
competitive sport again?</LD>
<LD>   Greg Norman has his eyes on just such a person. No, it's not
Norman himself, or Phil Mickelson, or Ernie Els, or any of the other
current also-rans on the tour.</LD>
<LD>   "Phil and Ernie and Sergio [Garcia] and Vijay [Singh] and Retief
[Goosen] and David [Duval]," Norman writes on his Web site, "have
only one hope left: the Swedish model."</LD>
<TE>   That would be Elin Nordegren, Woods' 22-year-old girlfriend, whose
photo layouts have become a huge hit on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The nanny: Nordegren was nanny to golfer Jesper Parnevik's kids
when she met Woods at last year's British Open. Parnevik told a
Swedish newspaper it was love at first sight.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Tiger Woods will become so head-over-heels in love with his
new girlfriend," Norman writes, "that he'll want to get married, have
children and quit playing golf for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Dream on, Greg.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The record for individual assists in a Laker playoff
game is 24, held jointly by a Laker and a Laker opponent. Name the
two players.</TE>
<TE>   Short story: Norman Chad on AOL Exclusive, describing the lower
half of Utah Jazz guard John Stockton's uniform: "There's no easy
explanation for Stockton's short shorts. I figure he just latched
onto a pair in eighth-grade phys ed, loved the feel of them and
decided to keep them until they fell off."</TE>
<TE>   Tough crowd: The New York Mets put pitcher Satoru Komiyama on the
disabled list after he broke the middle finger on his pitching hand
opening a garage door.</TE>
<TE>   Says Bret Lewis of KFWB (980): "Anyone in New York can tell you
how hard it is to get through the day in that city without the use of
your middle finger."</TE>
<TE>   Bird watching: Larry Bird may be far removed from the Boston
Celtics, but he's still a fan. And a critic.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I watch [Paul Pierce] play," Bird told Jackie
MacMullan of the Boston Globe, "he's hitting every one of his shots.
But then, when it's over, you look and he's shooting 40%. I am always
so surprised when that happens. Forty percent is so bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Antoine [Walker], with him you notice all the misses because
he takes so many bad shots."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1912, Fenway Park opened in Boston
with the Red Sox defeating the New York Yankees, 7-6, in 11 innings.
Tiger Stadium in Detroit also opened its doors as the Tigers defeated
the Cleveland Indians, 6-5. Continuing the theme, on this day in
1916, the Chicago Cubs played their first game at Weeghman
Park--renamed Wrigley Field in 1926--beating the Cincinnati Reds,
7-6, in 11 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson had 24 assists in a 1994 playoff game
against the Phoenix Suns. Stockton had 24 for Utah against the Lakers
in a 1988 playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   Finally: Phil Mushnick of the New York Post reports that New York
Ranger radio announcer Sal Messina was obviously unfamiliar with the
subject when he read a promo for a women's soccer match.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the name "Mia Hamm," Messina told his audience to tune
in when "the New York Power take on the Miami Ham."</TE>

<HD>Streaking Beltre Is Glad to Be Feeling Good</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Adrian Beltre finished Friday night's 5-2 victory over the San Diego
Padres with a healthy 11-game hitting streak and a .298 average.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers' 23-year-old third baseman said that should come as no
surprise. Last year he was recovering from two surgeries: a botched
appendix procedure that was performed in the Dominican Republic on
Jan. 12, and a follow-up surgery on March 12 in the United States
that was done to repair the damage.</LD>
<LD>   He opened the season on the disabled list and finished with a .265
batting average, 13 home runs and 60 runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year, I was trying to get back the feeling of being healthy
while I was playing every day," Beltre said. "This year, I am
completely healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, in his third season as the Dodgers' starting third
baseman, extended his streak with a triple in the fourth inning
against Brian Lawrence. Beltre hit a fly ball to left field that
cleared the fence, but left fielder Ron Gant leaped and gloved the
ball as he crashed into the fence. The force of the collision caused
Gant to drop the ball and Beltre steamed into third.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been swinging a lot better the last 12 days," said Beltre,
who is 15 for 41 during the streak with two home runs, a triple, two
doubles and four RBIs. "I'm getting deeper into counts and getting
good pitches to hit.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a streak, it's kind of motivating. You always want
to get a hit, but when you have a streak going, you concentrate even
more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie shortstop Cesar Izturis committed his first two errors of
the season Thursday against the Padres, but he was unfazed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to happen," Izturis said. "What happened last night
is the past. I don't really think about the past.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm glad we won the game because if we had lost, that would
have been tough."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said he was not worried about his 22-year-old
shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's something you're going to see on any kind of
a regular basis, so if you were here [Thursday], I guess you afford
yourself the opportunity to say, 'Hey, I saw him make two errors in
one game once.'"</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Careful With Brown</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Although indications are pitcher will go on
disabled list, team says no decisions have been made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All signs Friday pointed to Omar Daal enjoying life in the rotation
longer and Kevin Brown returning to the disabled list soon because of
torn scar tissue in Brown's surgically repaired right elbow, though
the Dodgers said nothing has been determined while continuing to
accentuate the positive.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy acknowledged that Brown still had swelling
around his elbow--seemingly a red flag--after the club's No. 1
starter played catch on flat ground for the fourth time in as many
days. But Tracy said a decision would not be made until today
because, "As rigorously as he threw the ball, we're going to wait and
see how he's doing before we decide any course."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers hope Brown will be ready to pitch off a mound for the
first time since re-injuring his elbow in last Saturday's 6-4 loss to
the San Diego Padres at Qualcomm Stadium, taking another step away
from the disabled list. And they're feeling less queasy about losing
Brown for a few more starts after Omar Daal worked 61/3 strong
innings in Thursday's 5-2 victory at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   But the team isn't the same without the 37-year-old right-hander,
who appears headed to the disabled list for the first time this
season and fourth time since the beginning of the 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about a lot of things," Tracy said after emerging from
a private meeting with General Manager Dan Evans and medical
personnel. "Obviously, you don't sit around and talk about just that
one thing. You talk about other areas that you would go to if, in
fact, it doesn't work out exactly the way you'd like to see it work
out.</TE>
<TE>   "That's conversation that I like to have. I don't like to see us
staggering around searching for an answer if we have to come up with
one.... As of right now, he is on course to [start Wednesday against
the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park]. But we're getting ahead of
ourselves by saying it's going to happen because we still have to
wait and see how he is."</TE>
<TE>   Team physician Frank Jobe seemed to be ahead of the curve,
intimating he would recommend putting Brown on the disabled list
unless something changed quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've done is gone day by day," he said. "After eight days,
it's getting close to the time to make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Brown used to push the envelope with injuries, pitching through
many and often returning sooner than advised. He said his experience
last season, when he underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle Sept.
27, has made him more conservative, and the Dodgers are more forceful
with him, or at least trying harder to reason with him.</TE>
<TE>   "From my vantage point as the manager of the club, we will err on
the side of caution," Tracy said. "It's April, not the end of August.
It's not a huge situation, a critical situation in the month of
September, and all those types of things are very important to me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brown won't make it easy on the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice to Kevin is that you always want to make sure you're
pitching in September," agent Scott Boras said. "As evidenced by
[Thursday] night's game, there's certainly a bit of leeway with
available guys who can give some innings, without taxing the bullpen,
that will allow him to be a little more [conservative] about his
rehab.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'd say to Kevin. Whether or not Kevin would listen
to that, that's another matter."</TE>
<TE>   Daal provided what the Dodgers needed against the Padres, working
efficiently and effectively in his first start with the club. The
left-hander is not considered in Brown's class, but the Dodgers
believe he could be a good replacement for their staff ace.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy who could be starting for lots of teams," pitching
coach Jim Colborn said. "It was great foresight by the front office
to arrange things like this. You can count on one hand the teams that
have had this kind of depth."</TE>
<TE>   Brown agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge boost," he said. "Obviously, you're not depending on
somebody that has very little, or no experience, in the big leagues.
He's done it, he's comfortable with it and he's been successful at
it. That's a great luxury."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Fire Gauthier as General Manager</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck General Manager Pierre Gauthier was fired Friday, less
than a week after the team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the
third consecutive season.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversees the Ducks, said
he would start searching for a new general manager immediately.
Former New York Ranger general manager Neil Smith, who is a
consultant for the Ducks, is expected to be a leading candidate.</LD>
<LD>   This is another shakeup in an organization that was once extremely
successful under Disney. The Ducks sold out 90 of 93 games during one
stretch in the 1990s and their merchandise sales were among the
highest in professional sports.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously we are disappointed in what we have been able to
achieve the last three seasons," Pressler said. "Although Pierre did
a great job molding this team and helping us, I want to accelerate us
becoming a Stanley Cup contender. With new leadership, we have a
better chance of getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is given that task will have a small base of solid
players, including Paul Kariya, on which to build. But it is also a
team that finished 25 points out of the playoffs this season.</TE>
<TE>   The problems are not just on the ice. Attendance at home games has
plummeted the last five seasons, with the Ducks drawing crowds
estimated at 6,000 for many games this season. Some team sponsors
were concerned by the poor attendance and how they were being treated
by the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is good for us," center Matt Cullen said. "The path
we were following the last few years wasn't taking us where we want
to go. Obviously changes were needed. It's great for us to have a
fresh start. This will be good."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Duck players were stunned by the news. Even Gauthier
appeared to be caught off guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a meeting with him [Thursday] to discuss team matters,"
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said. "He said nothing that led me to
believe he wouldn't be back. We are all tired of losing. I was
concerned because we got to do something to make this better, make
the playoffs, simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier was general manager for four seasons, taking over a team
that had finished 13 points out of the playoffs for the 1997-98
season and still hadn't recovered from the firing of Coach Ron
Wilson, ordered by then-team President Tony Tavares after the Ducks
were eliminated in the second round of the 1997 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier added two key players, defenseman Fredrik Olausson and
forward Marty McInnis, and got immediate results.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks finished sixth in the Western Conference but were
eliminated in the first round of the 1999 playoffs by the Detroit Red
Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Things unraveled quickly after that season. The Ducks finished
last in the Western Conference in 2000-01 and were 13th this season.
Gauthier added pieces--goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, forward Dan
Bylsma and defenseman Keith Carney--but was unable to improve the
overall quality and depth.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier's hands-on style, plus a sometimes abrasive personality,
intimidated many in the front office. One employee approached
Gauthier with a question before the season and was dressed down,
according to numerous sources. Gauthier compared the employee to a
chair, there to be used only when needed.</TE>
<TE>   Players felt he was aloof, some becoming angry this season when it
was revealed Gauthier had faxed to other teams a list of 10 players
on the trading block.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier also often contradicted several of his own statements.</TE>
<TE>   He said Coach Craig Hartsburg was not the problem early in the
2000-01 season, then fired Hartsburg a month later.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier said he wouldn't trade star forward Teemu Selanne, then
sent him to San Jose a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   But what hurt him the most was the team's inability to make the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "You never expect something like this," Tverdovsky said. "But the
other thing is when the team is not doing well, someone has to take
the blame. Either the players or coaches, or the management."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Ruiz Quickly Making an Impression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Ruiz has played only three Major League Soccer games, but
already the Galaxy's Guatemalan striker is a marked man.</LD>
<LD>   Because Ruiz has scored five goals in those three matches, he can
expect defenders to crowd him more tightly and to feel the crunch of
tackles that have a lot more bite to them.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the 22-year-old hasn't already been targeted. In his
three games, he has been fouled 10 times, more often than any other
Galaxy player.</LD>
<TE>   "In Guatemala, this did not happen so frequently because the style
of play was slower and more technical," he said. "In MLS, [the play]
is quicker and more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Ruiz experiences a road game for the first time in his
MLS career when the Galaxy travels to the Cotton Bowl for an
early-season rematch with the Dallas Burn. The teams tied at the Rose
Bowl last Saturday, 1-1, with Ruiz scoring the tying goal five
minutes from the end. The Burn is likely to be on the lookout for
him.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting very used to the sight of Carlos ripping off his
shirt and running to the crowd with a last-minute winner," Ivan
Gazidis, the league's deputy commissioner, said earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could have foreseen that Carlos would be able to do this
so soon. I think he has the potential to be a real star for the
Galaxy and this league."</TE>
<TE>   Even though unbeaten, the Galaxy has struggled. All five of the
team's goals--every one of them by Ruiz--have all been scored in the
last 10 minutes of regulation play or in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [scoring goals] depends on any one player," Ruiz
said, "but if the team functions well at moving the ball, either me
or some other player will find the opportunities to score."</TE>

<HD>Tide Rolls to Title, UCLA Takes Third</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Valorie Kondos Field's words said no, she wasn't disappointed that
UCLA's two-year reign as the NCAA women's gymnastics champion was
ended by Alabama Friday at Coleman Coliseum, because her team had
competed with heart and passion.</LD>
<LD>   But the expression in the UCLA coach's eyes said yes, the Bruins
deserved a better fate than third place behind the Crimson Tide and
Georgia at the NCAA Super Six final.</LD>
<LD>   Did Alabama, competing before a roaring crowd of 7,034, benefit
from a home-gym advantage in winning its fourth national title?</LD>
<TE>   "What do you think?" Kondos Field asked rhetorically. "I'm very
pleased with how we performed. We competed very well, well enough to
win the national championship. Our plan is always to come out and
compete our meet. We had a great season and a great meet."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama, the highest-scoring team in Thursday's preliminary team
competition, was remarkably sharp for the second consecutive night,
nailing its vaults and showing steely nerves on the beam. The Tide
finished with 197.575 points, to 197.250 for Georgia and 197.150 for
the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Utah was fourth, with 196.950 points, followed by Nebraska
(196.425) and Stanford (196.025 in its Super Six debut).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Alabama, UCLA had to overcome some small wobbles, a few
imperfect landings, and a fall by Alyssa Beckerman on the balance
beam. The lowest score among the six performers in each event is
dropped and the rest are added to determine the team's score for that
event, and the team's total is the sum of its scores on the four
events. After dropping Beckerman's 9.050, UCLA scored 49.150 on the
beam, fourth behind Alabama, Georgia and Utah and its lowest event
score of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "She only competes in two events. Beam is her event. She's the
beam queen," Kondos Field said of Beckerman. "She put extra care into
every skill instead of letting it flow."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama was exuberant and sure in every event. Despite losing
senior all-around competitor Raegan Tomasek to a leg injury Thursday,
the Tide got clutch performances from its entire lineup. Andree
Pickens scored 9.95 on the vault, uneven bars and beam, and added a
9.90 on the floor for an all-around total of 39.750; when she
completed her beam routine, the last performer on the last rotation,
the partisan crowd leapt to its feet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the perfect end of a four-year career," said Pickens, a
senior from Houston. "I knew if we were solid, it was ours."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had completed their rotations by then and had gone to
their locker room, knowing Georgia and Alabama could pass them but
feeling no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "We congratulated each other for a great season and a great NCAA
championship," said Yvonne Tousek, who will defend her uneven bars
title in tonight's individual event finals. "We're proud of each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Onnie Willis agreed. "We came out and did what we wanted to do.
[Beckerman's fall] was a fluke. Overall, I think we did pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The championships end today with the individual event finals.
Willis, Doni Thompson, Jamie Dantzscher and Tousek will compete in
the bars final, Beckerman and Dantzscher on the beam, Dantzscher and
Willis in floor exercise and Dantzscher in vault.</TE>

<HD>2003 'Cup to Santa Anita</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: It's official that track will play host to
sport's richest day for the third time, but for the first since 1993.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Anita, where the biggest Breeders' Cup upset occurred in 1993,
has been officially tapped to host the one-day glut of million-dollar
races next year.</LD>
<LD>   Twice in recent years the Breeders' Cup planned to return to Santa
Anita, but the event went elsewhere because of ongoing construction
at the Arcadia track.</LD>
<LD>   "After two false starts in the last three years, it's with
particular pleasure to learn of this selection for 2003," said
Sherwood Chillingworth, executive vice president of the Oak Tree
Racing Assn. Oak Tree, a not-for-profit group that leases the track
for an annual fall meet.</LD>
<TE>   The Breeders' Cup made a tentative commitment to Santa Anita in
September, but didn't confirm the selection, the third for the track,
until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 20th Breeders' Cup--eight races worth $13 million--will be run
on Oct. 25, 2003. On almost that same day in 1993, Arcangues, a
sore-backed longshot from France, won the Breeders' Cup Classic at a
whopping 133-1 and paid $269.20 for a $2 bet, still the series
record.</TE>
<TE>   The first Santa Anita Breeders' Cup came in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The other three Breeders' Cups in California were run at Hollywood
Park, most recently in 1997. This year's races will be run on Oct. 26
at a new Breeders' Cup venue, Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   While the Breeders' Cup appreciates the virtual guarantee of good
weather in California--temperatures were in the 80s at Santa Anita in
1993--European trainers would generally prefer the shorter trips and
the cooler weather that the tracks in New York and Kentucky can offer
their horses. Dancing Brave, the English colt who was one of the
biggest Breeders' Cup favorites, went down to defeat at 1-2 odds in
the Turf Stakes at Santa Anita in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Officer's problematic career took another backward turn Friday,
when trainer Bob Baffert said that he was scratching the 3-year-old
colt from today's $325,000 Coolmore Lexington Stakes at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Officer, the 8-5 morning-line favorite for the Lexington, was
found to have a swelling in the tendon area of his lower left foreleg
after a routine morning gallop at Churchill Downs on Thursday.
Baffert, saying that the injury wasn't career-ending, said Officer
would be returned to California, where after a three-month rest he's
expected to resume training.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert, who won consecutive Derbys with Silver Charm and Real
Quiet in 1997-98, will have a starter in the race this year, on May
4, because Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., which also races
Officer, last week bought 90% of War Emblem, the Illinois Derby
winner, for an estimated $1million.</TE>
<TE>   With Officer out, the post-time Lexington favorite will be either
Ethan Man or Easyfromthegitgo. Steve Asmussen, who trains
Easyfromthegitgo, said this week that he would prefer to zero in on
the Derby with two other colts, Private Emblem and Windward Passage,
and Patrick Byrne, who trains Ethan Man, said it would take a big
effort today for that colt to run back at Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   But Wayne Lukas, who missed the Derby last year for the first time
since 1981, probably would consider the Derby if his Proud Citizen
scored an upset in the Lexington. Proud Citizen beat only one horse
in the Santa Anita Derby and is 8-1 on the morning line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Chavez, who has been riding Booklet, has the Kentucky Derby
assignment on Easy Grades, the runner-up in the Santa Anita Derby....
Saarland, who suffered a breathing problem while running fourth in
the Wood Memorial, underwent corrective surgery Wednesday. He's still
expected to run in the Derby.... Unless Mick Kinane fights a
seven-day suspension in England, he won't be available to ride
Johannesburg in the Derby. Kinane received the suspension after one
of his mounts was disqualified from first to fifth in a stake at
Newmarket on Thursday. Jerry Bailey will likely ride Johannesburg in
Kinane's place. Right now Bailey has the mount on Johannesburg's
stablemate, Castle Gandolfo.</TE>

<HD>She Wants to Pull in Two Directions</HD>
<DH>Multisports: Northwood's Farson chooses to compete in track
and swimming during the same season with the hope of qualifying in
Southern Section finals in each sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christie Farson is racing a set of clocks, pushing her body to the
limit while simultaneously pulling it against the grain, all in an
effort to accomplish what few high school athletes attempt.</LD>
<LD>   Farson, a junior at Irvine Northwood High, is hoping to qualify
for the Southern Section finals in both track and swimming in the
coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   She has already experienced success in swimming and distance
running, having won a Southern Section Division II title in the
200-yard medley relay last spring and having led Northwood to
top-five finishes at the section's cross-country finals each of the
last three years.</LD>
<TE>   This spring is the first time she has competed in two sports in
the same season. Although she has developed quickly on the track, she
has experienced a noticeable drop-off in the pool.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I only planned to go to a couple [of track meets], but
then I found I enjoyed it and kept doing it," she said. "My swim
coach could tell I was not swimming the same, but he said [I should
try] to do my best in track."</TE>
<TE>   Farson's track times in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters have
consistently improved this spring. She turned in a 5-minute 25-second
four-lap split in the 6,400 relay Friday night at the Arcadia
Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   She's closing in on the Division III automatic qualifying time of
5:18.00 for 1,600 meters, which she must achieve at the Pacific Coast
League finals on May 2 to qualify for the section preliminaries May
11 at Long Beach College. That's the same day as the Division II swim
finals, five miles away at Belmont Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm dropping times consistently," said Farson, who is entered in
the seeded 1,600 at the Orange County Championships today at Trabuco
Hills High. "I can't wait to see where I am at the end of the
season."</TE>
<TE>   The trade-off has come in her swimming performances. She swam a
personal-best 58.16 in the 100-yard butterfly last season, good for
fifth at the section finals. So far this season her best time is
1:02.25, a half-body length off the Division II automatic qualifying
standard of 1:01.50.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only been putting in about half the [time in swimming]
practice I did last season," Farson said. "Right now, I'm just trying
to see if I can get a qualifying time, but so far I haven't gotten
close to last year's times."</TE>
<TE>   She looked strong Tuesday at the preliminaries of the Southern
Section Relays, notching a 27.1 split in the 200-yard butterfly relay
and helping the Timberwolves earn top qualifying honors for Monday's
final at Belmont Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad to see her turn in a good swim," swimming Coach Ron
Hansen said. "She had been down on herself lately."</TE>
<TE>   Farson isn't the only prep athlete to participate in distance
running and swimming. Erin Zehntner is familiar with the discipline
it takes to compete in both.</TE>
<TE>   Zehntner ran cross-country for three seasons and swam for four at
Irvine High from 1995-99. Her best cross-country season came as a
sophomore, when she was fourth at the Division I section finals and
13th in state.</TE>
<TE>   She quit running her senior year to concentrate on swimming. That
spring, she won a Division I section title in the 200 freestyle and
went on to compete at the 2000 Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do both sports at the same time and perform at a high
level," said Zehntner, now in her third year at UCLA, although she no
longer competes after undergoing hip surgery. "With swimming, you
have to commit to whatever workout you have that day. You don't have
much time or energy to do anything else. That's not surprising to
hear her times are falling."</TE>
<TE>   Barrett Schulenburg, girls' track and field coach at Northwood,
said he began tweaking Farson's interest in the sport while she was a
student in his history class last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'Whatever the swimming coach says, we'll work it
out.'" Schulenburg said. "I was kind of surprised when she came to me
and said she would like to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Farson and her two coaches worked out a training schedule in which
she would split practice time between the sports and attempt to make
all the competitions. The arrangement has forced Farson to be
creative, occasionally training before and after school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a challenge, but she's very motivated to do it,"
Schulenburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Farson has been the top distance runner at Northwood since the
school opened in 1999. She has twice helped the Timberwolves qualify
for the state cross-country meet.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been our leader since her freshman year," said Randy
Rossi, girls' cross-country coach.</TE>
<TE>   Farson said her drop-off in swim times has caused her to think
about next spring, and whether it's worth splitting time between
sports. She hopes to continue running in college, but would like to
end her swimming career on a high note.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of depends on how the swim season goes," she said. "I
might devote all my time to track next year."</TE>

<TE>   Fast fact: Matt Bruno of Trabuco Hills will run in the boys' 100
meters after missing last Saturday's Arcadia Invitational with
tendinitis in his right foot. "I did block practice today and I felt
no pain," said Bruno, who placed third in the 100 at the state
championships last year. "But it's my right foot. It bothers me most
when I run the turn [in the 200]."</TE>

<LD>The defending champion is back, but she is not the one to beat in the
$250,000 Santa Barbara Handicap today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Astra, who defeated Beautiful Noise and five others as the 7-5
favorite in last year's race, will try for her ninth victory in 13
starts in the Grade II, but most of the attention will be focused on
Golden Apples.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Gary Tanaka and trained by Ben Cecil, the Irish-bred
filly has established herself as arguably the best female turf
performer in the country and she will be favored to remain perfect at
Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of her previous two starts on the turf, Golden Apples
began her 4-year-old campaign with a powerful victory in last month's
Santa Ana Handicap. Outrun early as usual, she was last after six
furlongs and it appeared to some she may be in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   However, she began a strong rally under jockey Garrett Gomez along
the inside and was up to beat pacesetter--and 2001 Matriarch
winner--Starine by a little more than a length. It was her fourth
victory in nine starts and only once has she been worse than third.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Astra, who will be making her second start for trainer
Laura De Seroux after winning eight of 11 for Simon Bray, the rest of
the field consists of Polaire--who will race coupled with Golden
Apples because she is also owned by Tanaka--Blue Moon, Desiraes My
Candy and Old Money.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bluesthestandard and Aggressive, who have
combined to win eight of 11, head a field of eight $20,000 claimers
going six furlongs in today's eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Valenzuela. He won two races with longshots
Thursday, coming from off the pace to win the sixth with Cafe Del Mar
($18), then, subbing for Martin Pedroza, took Meet Me To Dixie
($29.80) wire-to-wire in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The Right Prize. Claimed first for $40,000, then for
$50,000, the gelding has one third in eight starts and is running
against $12,500 maidens in today's ninth at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Cat Blade in the fifth,
using Issaqueena, Gold Scammer and Vital Asset in the sixth and
Friendly Wager, Another Star, Broadway Moon, Such Charisma and
Riverside in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/228. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $21/$1,313. Total money bet: $1,428.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>After hearing an explanation from Denis Morel, supervisor of
officials for Thursday night's playoff opener against the Colorado
Avalanche, the Kings at least know why a first-period goal by Craig
Johnson was disallowed.</LD>
<LD>   But it did little to mollify them.</LD>
<LD>   Referee Stephane Auger waved off the goal, which was scored on a
rebound from a scrum in front of the net, because he had intended to
blow his whistle to stop the play, believing that goaltender Patrick
Roy had covered the puck.</LD>
<TE>   At least, that was the explanation given the Kings by Morel, King
Coach Andy Murray said Friday, mulling his team's 4-3 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not satisfactory when you lose the game by one goal," Murray
said. "Obviously, we feel there was a poor judgment made by the
official. He's in a tough spot. He's a young referee, calling his
first playoff game, I believe.</TE>
<TE>   "But we watched the replays and he has the whistle at his mouth
during that whole scrum in front of the net. It's not like something
he had to bring up from his side and blow it. If he wanted to blow
it, he could have blown it earlier. He didn't. He blew the whistle
when the puck was in the back of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I guess that's their excuse. But I can't use that
[excuse] if I intended to cover my guy out in front of the net [and
he scores]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski was glad to finally put a puck past a goaltender
but disappointed that his third goal since Jan. 5, his first not
scored into an empty net, came in a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bittersweet," he said of his second-period goal, which cut
the Kings' deficit to 2-1. "Great play by Cliffy [Ronning] coming
into the zone there [before feeding a pass to Smolinski in the left
faceoff circle]. I was just able to slide it underneath [Roy]. It was
a big lift and I was glad to be a part of it."</TE>

<TE>   With Rob Blake leading the way with four shots on goal, Avalanche
defensemen accounted for eight of the team's 31 shots against King
goaltender Felix Potvin in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Expect more of the same today.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get a chance we want to keep jumping into the play," said
defenseman Martin Skoula, who had an assist on Colorado's second goal
Thursday. "But we don't want to make stupid mistakes by jumping when
it is not there.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Kings] cover the three forwards really good. [In Game 1] we
wanted to help generate more offense by jumping into the play and get
that extra fourth guy involved."</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Blake ranked among the league's top
defensemen in scoring with 16 goals and 56 points.</TE>
<TE>   But it was veteran Greg de Vries who scored the lone goal by an
Avalanche defenseman in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Our decision making was very good," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley
said. "Our defensemen were very involved and worked well with our
forwards."</TE>
<TE>   Having defensemen helping out on offense can sometimes lead to
easy goals by the opponent. That happened twice to the Avalanche in
Game 1 on goals scored by the Kings' Ziggy Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, we were very aggressive for no reason," Roy said. "But
overall we did a good job. We won a lot of the physical battles."</TE>
<TE>   Added Hartley: "Two of the goals we gave up did come on plays when
a defenseman jumped into the play. But that's part of our plan. We
want our six defensemen to have the green light to move in as long as
they use common sense and feel that it is worth it. Sometimes, that
does backfire on you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado forward Alex Tanguay fell short of expectations during
the regular season with 13 goals and 48 points.</TE>
<TE>   But Hartley stuck with him and put him on the Avalanche's top line
with Joe Sakic and rookie Radim Vrbata. Tanguay rewarded his coach
Thursday with one of his best games of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to give a guy a tap on the back or a kick in
the butt. I think it's safe to say that [Tanguay] got both during the
season," Hartley said. "It's a fresh start for everyone and the way
Alex played in Game 1, I thought he was dominant. He was first to the
puck, had lots of energy going to the net and he was great on the
forecheck."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Milan Hejduk, who sat out the last 20 games of the season
because of an abdominal injury, practiced Friday with the Avalanche
and took part in contact drills for the first time in nearly two
months. Hejduk will not play today but probably will return if the
series goes beyond four games.</TE>

<HD>Defense Takes Holiday on Ice</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Kings, Avalanche are among NHL's hardest to score
against, except when they play each other.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Both teams set club records for defense, ranking among the best in
the NHL. Their goaltenders posted career-low goals-against averages.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, whenever the Kings and Colorado Avalanche played this
season, their defensive statistics suffered, as was the case again
Thursday night in the Avalanche's 4-3 victory in Game 1 of their
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings posted a franchise-low 2.29 goals-against average during
the regular season, but in five games against the Avalanche they have
given up fewer than four goals only once. And this is an Avalanche
team that set club records for fewest goals in a season (212) and
number of times shut out (10).</LD>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, gave up a league-low 169 goals and led
the league with a franchise-record 2.04 goals-against average. But
the Kings scored six goals in one game against Colorado and averaged
3.75 in the last four.</TE>
<TE>   "It would still be difficult to convince the players that there's
a lot of open ice out there because they're taking a lot of
punishment physically," King Coach Andy Murray said Friday, asked
about the trend after the Kings practiced in the Pepsi Center in
preparation for Game 2 today. "It's been demanding that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams play a pressure forechecking game. We don't sit back.
There have been some turnovers created because of that. There have
been mistakes made. But I think it's still certainly the emphasis to
be good defensively."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers say defense has not been emphasized enough.</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy, whose 1.94 goals-against average
led the NHL and was the best of his brilliant career, must cringe at
his 3.21 average against the Kings. Against the rest of the NHL, it
was 1.85.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Felix Potvin has been worse against the
Avalanche. His goals-against average, 2.25 against everybody else, is
3.43 against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of the way both teams play," Avalanche Coach
Bob Hartley said of the inflated numbers. "We play two different
styles and that creates openings on both sides. But perhaps the
biggest [factor] is that both teams have gifted hockey players, which
makes for very exciting games."</TE>
<TE>   Exciting, no question, but uncharacteristic for teams that ranked
among the league leaders not only in goals-against average but also
in penalty killing.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1, the Kings had an early goal disallowed on a
questionable call. Then they rallied from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits,
scoring three goals in about 121/2 minutes before defenseman Greg de
Vries scored on a rebound with 5:34 to play, giving the Avalanche the
victory with his first goal in 67 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both teams looking back would like to have a couple of
goals back and play a little bit tighter defensively," King
defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. "But we dug ourselves a little bit
of a hole, being down 2-0, and we had to open it up to get back into
the game. And once that style of hockey started being played, it was
a little bit back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's hard in the middle of the game, with all the
emotion, especially in Game 1, to all of a sudden start to be more
conservative. It was a kind of game where it was go, go, go, back and
forth. Probably pretty entertaining hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Not unlike the previous four games between the teams, which
resulted in a regular-season series split, the Kings outscoring the
Avalanche, 14-13.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, in a seven-game Western Conference semifinal series
won by the Avalanche, the Kings scored only six goals in the last six
games but still won two, 1-0 victories by Potvin in Games 5 and 6,
the second in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps form will prevail again as this series develops.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know what to expect," Murray said. "I know they're
going to be hotly contested games and they're going to be physical.
Both teams have a lot of pride. I think it's tough to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd think probably they would be lower-scoring based on the
playoffs last year. But it's really hard to say. I think both coaches
go in with the idea, 'Let's make sure we're solid defensively.' But
if we can win, 8-7, we'll take it."</TE>

<HD>Horry Says He'll Be Ready to Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By midafternoon Friday, two days before the Lakers would open their
first-round playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Robert
Horry said he would play, without a doubt.</LD>
<LD>   Horry has developed a hematoma, or collection of blood, beneath
his abdominal muscle, but he withstood two hours of treatment Friday
morning, jogged through parts of a practice and afterward matched
24-foot jumpers in a contest with five other Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   A savvy power forward who is the Lakers' best chance at defending
Portland's rangy Rasheed Wallace, Horry has not made it to the end of
either of his last two games, leaving because of sharp abdominal pain
after 22 minutes Monday and three minutes Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel fine," Horry said in a voice a bit too high.</TE>
<TE>   But, he insisted, "No doubts at all. I'll be ready and willing to
go."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of practice, Horry stood, near Phil Jackson, during a
five-on-five scrimmage. He leaned against the basket stanchion, his
hands wrapped in the bottom of his purple jersey.</TE>
<TE>   When it was done, he grabbed a basketball and loped as he does to
the other end of the floor, and flicked jump shots without effort. He
chased his misses easily, without apparent regard to the injury that
could shape the final days of the Lakers' hopes to three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had little or no pain.</TE>
<TE>   "If I do have it I'm going to just ignore it. So I'll be all
right," said Horry, who frequently experiences discomfort in his
knees, hips and back. He sat out one game this season because of a
tight hamstring, an ailment that bothered him sporadically for
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I can [play through it]," he said. "All through my
career, I've been playing with some kind of little injury. So I
should be able to handle this."</TE>
<TE>   It is critical to the Lakers that he does. As Jackson reminded
everyone Friday, a run through the Western Conference playoffs
probably means playing through power forwards Wallace, Tim Duncan and
Chris Webber, some of the most talented players in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Offensively, the Laker strengths lie elsewhere, at center with
Shaquille O'Neal and swingman with Kobe Bryant. If they win their
third consecutive title, the Lakers will have come with three
starters at power forward, the Samaki Walker/Horry combination
following first A.C. Green and then Horace Grant.</TE>
<TE>   By last season's playoffs, however, Horry was getting nearly as
many minutes as Grant, and most of the fourth-quarter playing time,
just as he would this season.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that these are the playoffs, Horry said, helps deaden his
abdominal discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mask the pain," he said, "but you realize these games
are very important, that you have to go through them. If it's not
anything that's going to keep you from playing the game after that,
then you keep going. But, for the most part, you ignore pain."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who admires Horry's ability to stabilize his game in the
playoffs, said he was not yet willing to assume Horry would be ready
for the start of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope so," he said. "We're optimistic that another day [will
help], that [today] he'll get out on the basketball court and do some
things and then play on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Less Horry, of course, would mean the need for more Shaq. Walker,
Slava Medvedenko and Mark Madsen would see the minutes spillover, but
O'Neal would feel the defensive crush and the offensive
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when you go to the playoffs, you start looking at his
playoff figures," Jackson said. "That's what a Shaq effort is all
about. We think 15 rebounds and 35 points."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal wouldn't argue that, probably. He averaged 30.4 points and
15.4 rebounds last postseason, though that was before his toe seized.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of past playoffs set up the best quote of the
early postseason, from O'Neal, discussing the difference between the
Trail Blazers with Arvydas Sabonis, and the Trail Blazers without
Sabonis, who retired last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I made Sabonis quit two years ago," O'Neal said. "If he comes
back, I'll make him quit again."</TE>

Shaquille O'Neal, a 335-Pound Force of Nature, Into the Mix and Every
Call Becomes ...</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Walton pops a videotape into the recorder and a game between the
Lakers and Chicago Bulls appears on the screen.</LD>
<LD>   The game, played Jan. 12, would have been another ho-hum midseason
bore--except that Laker center Shaquille O'Neal loses his cool after
being hacked one too many times by Brad Miller of the Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   Footage of O'Neal's swing (and miss) at Miller's head sparked
debate about the punishment O'Neal takes--and delivers--and the
difficulty of officiating a game that features a player who has no
peer.</LD>
<TE>   "They always talk about all the great players getting all the
calls," said Walton, a television commentator who was one of
basketball's best centers.</TE>
<TE>   "But the great players are involved in every single play. The
better they are the more stiffs that are going to be out there who
are going to come and try to slow [them] down by fouling.... That's
why you keep moving."</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of moving....</TE>
<TE>   "Right when Shaq gets the ball, watch his feet," Walton said.
"First of all, he gets hit, now watch his feet and ask which one is
his pivot foot. What's a defensive player to do if they don't call
that? Call the violations!"</TE>
<TE>   The tape continues to roll.</TE>
<TE>   "How is that not steps?" Walton asks. "He just changed pivot feet
on the way to the basket.... As a defensive player, your goal is to
make the guy use bad footwork, but if the referee doesn't call steps,
they don't call double dribble, they don't call three seconds, then
what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   What to do, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   What O'Neal is allowed--and what leeway opponents are given in
trying to defend him--will be key to the Lakers' success in the
playoffs, beginning Sunday against Portland at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Cuban, the controversial owner of the Dallas Mavericks, put
the spotlight on officiating this week when he said, "Ref assignments
are more important than playoff matchups in the West. You get the
wrong ref, that's worse than getting the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Teams can't pick which officials work their games, but Cuban, who
has been fined more than $1 million for critical comments about NBA
referees the last two seasons, reportedly has compiled pages of
statistics on the tendencies of some officials.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, according to Cuban and others, is guilty of traveling,
camping in the paint for more than three seconds, charging and using
his off arm to clear his path of defenders while he launches a shot.</TE>
<TE>   On orders from the league offices, referees can't be interviewed
about their work. As for Walton, he sees both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a small handful of guys who are the most difficult guys
in the history of the game to referee," Walton said. "Shaq's one of
them.... Shaq's combination of power and skill separates him from any
player in the history of basketball other than Wilt [Chamberlain]....</TE>
<TE>   "It's always tough when you're the biggest and strongest because
there is no sympathy. There is no recognition that there is anything
wrong. But as a referee, none of that should matter. When you see a
hit, when you see someone committing a foul, you should call it.</TE>
<TE>   "He absorbs a lot and he gives a lot. Like all the great
ones--Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], Magic [Johnson], [Larry] Bird--they all
gave it out. But none of those guys had the physical power that you
have with Shaq, so when he gives it out, it's like life-threatening."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is officially listed at 7 feet 1, 335 pounds, and he is all
but impossible to guard straight up in a league increasingly devoid
of other quality big men. Even though he was slowed this season by
pain from an arthritic right big toe, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and
10.5 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no answer for him," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"You've got to be willing to use your 18 fouls from your three post
players on him. If he catches it in the low post, there's not a guy
in the NBA, the NFL, major league baseball or the NHL who can stop
him. Maybe in the WWF.... "</TE>
<TE>   The key, Walton said, is to not let O'Neal receive a pass close to
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is so powerful, it's very difficult because he can get great
position and he is phenomenal, probably the best center ever, at that
reverse spin move where he catches the lob and dunks it. But it's
also the way he reposts himself.... Once he gives the ball up, you
relax defensively a little bit and he just takes advantage of that.</TE>
<TE>   "[The defender] is standing there and all of a sudden Shaq has the
ball. He doesn't like where he is and he throws it out and backs up
and he's right where he wants to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball is exactly like chess. It's all about control of the
areas, the positions. John Wooden had so many great sayings:
'Basketball is not a game of size and strength. It is a game of
skill, timing and position.' Shaq has all that stuff, but he also has
the unmatched power and he can play both games."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi, the Clippers' 7-foot center, offered this
advice about guarding O'Neal, who outweighs him by about 70 pounds:
"Your best possible hope is to try to draw a charge. He's too big,
too experienced and his footwork is too good. He could score 100
points on you if he wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're behind him and he makes that turn where he dips his
shoulder into you, you have to hope for a charge. You're at the mercy
of the refs."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi and the Clippers did a credible job in four games
against O'Neal this season, "holding" him to an average of 22.5
points. It was a far cry from the March 6, 2000 game, when O'Neal
went for a career-best 61 points against them.</TE>
<TE>   What stood out this season, however, was a near fight between
Olowokandi and O'Neal in the closing moments of the Lakers' victory
March 15. A frustrated O'Neal claimed Olowokandi was too rough with
him. An equally perturbed Olowokandi said O'Neal could dish it out
but not take it and it was time for him to "grow up."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been praised for his restraint. Until going after
Miller, he had been a model citizen in the face of constant pounding.</TE>
<TE>   It's an admirable trait, according to Walton.</TE>
<TE>   "The way you get back [at opponents] is in the course of the
action," he said. "Taking a hard foul on a blocked shot. On a
rebound, you go past the normal rotation of your elbows. A lot of
times, you have the mind-set, 'I'm going to punch them all out,' but
that's just the rage that makes you play better.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of your preparation, your willingness to go out there
and do anything, but you have to play with self-restraint."</TE>
<TE>   So how in the name of James Naismith do you stop O'Neal without
fouling out in the game's first six possessions?</TE>
<TE>   Some say there are tricks of the trade that can at least slow
O'Neal after he stations himself on the left block, his favorite
starting spot in the offense. Walton believes Sacramento's Vlade
Divac is perhaps best suited of all the Lakers' potential playoff
foes to thwart O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Vlade, despite his flaws, has the best chance because he can run,
think and pass," Walton said. "You can run an offense through him, he
can catch the ball and all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   There are three keys to defending O'Neal, according to Walton.</TE>
<TE>   "Eliminate the lobs, eliminate his right-handed jump hook and
eliminate his offensive rebounding," he said. "On the offensive end,
your goals would be to run him and have the ball in your hands a lot
so that he would have to guard the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "And constantly make him move. Don't ever let him stop."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi offered these tips:</TE>
<TE>   "You have to cut him off before they think he's open. Your
teammates have to play the passing lanes. Then maybe their guys will
pass the ball away from him. It's partly psychological. If they think
they can get it to him, they will. You have to overplay him. When you
see the ball two passes away, you have to be ready to cut that off.
You have to discourage them from passing the ball to him."</TE>
<TE>   And it that fails?</TE>
<TE>   "Just pray," Olowokandi said.</TE>

the April 11 ceremony itself was almost as pathetic as Halle Berry's
Oscar speech.</LD>
<LD>   Public address announcer Lawrence Tanter's timing was atrocious;
Carrot Top could have done better. I know he was probably only
reading off the cards, but he announced the Minnesota legends names
in such a fashion that allowed the crowd to cheer more (a lot more)
for the presenting icons: Sharman, Kupchak, West, Worthy and Baylor,
rather than the forerunners themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Even if it was unintended, and poorly organized, it was almost as
if the Laker brass were saying: "Yes, we are family, but while you
Minneapolis guys were OK, and paved the way for us, our L.A. guys
really outshined you."</LD>

<LD>When Barry Bonds broke Mark McGwire's single-season home run record
last year, I wonder if Major League Baseball officials immediately
called Pacific Bell Park to squawk about extending the fences
(Barryizing?).</LD>
<LD>   When Wayne Gretzky shattered the single-season goal record some
years ago, I'm curious if the powers of the NHL decided to
miniaturize the size of the goals and nets (Gretzkyizing?).</LD>
<LD>   When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar broke the all-time scoring record, did
the NBA commissioner and rules committee mull over raising the hoop
another foot? (Kareemizing?)</LD>
<TE>   Of course not! Ridiculous ideas all. Just goes to show how inane
the hierarchy of Augusta National was in extending, or "Tigerizing"
the course. Why try to stop one player (which they weren't able to
do) at the expense of countless other golfers that can't drive the
ball as well? Is it not fascinating to watch poetry in motion making
history in our lifetime? The Nielsens, golfing world, and the general
population think so.</TE>

stop him: You can only hope to contain him."</TE>

<TE>   Bill Plaschke's coverage of the Masters was annoying and
embarrassing, kind of like that old geezer on the golf course that
never shuts his yap.</TE>
<TE>   First, you knock Phil Mickelson all over the place, saying he
chokes in the majors. We are watching history in the making with
Tiger Woods winning six out of the last 10 majors. It's like calling
Johnny Unitas' backup a bum.</TE>
<TE>   Second, you jump on Woods' bandwagon in Sunday's edition because
you have no imagination. Third, you accuse Woods of lying back while
others fall, stumble and bogey their way out of contention because
they were scared.</TE>
<TE>   I am writing to Hootie Johnson and requesting that Plaschke be
sent one of those "letters" for next year's Masters.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a sports psychologist, I watched the best players in the world
"collapse" coming down the stretch in the Masters, leaving the
sportswriters and even Ken Venturi perplexed as to how to explain it.</TE>
<TE>   Why couldn't anyone mount an aggressive challenge to Tiger Woods,
they wondered? It's called pressure, and it can't be underrated.
Venturi knows what pressure is--long ago it cost him his chance of
being the only amateur to win the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   If we're going to invoke cliches like, "The Masters begins on the
back nine on Sunday," we need to try to remember what they are
intended to address: fear and trembling; pressure.</TE>

<TE>   It was exciting, thrilling and fun to watch Arnold Palmer "go for
it" over the years. You knew that whatever the situation he would
wrap the golf ball around the tree with a low hook and hope it
stopped near the green. Sometimes it didn't; when it did he won and
we loved it. I thank Arnold Palmer for all he has done for golf and
the thrills he gave us over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Come back any time, Arnie, and we will watch you take your clubs
out of the car and play golf--we don't care what you shoot.</TE>

<TE>   Because Tiger could not present his third green jacket to himself,
I thought it would have been more fitting, given the emotion of this
year's Masters, that Arnold Palmer should have presented Tiger with
it instead of Hootie Johnson.</TE>

<HD>Rafer's Choice Gets Mixed Review</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have for many years considered Rafer Johnson one of the two
greatest all-around athletes I ever saw perform, the other being
Jackie Robinson. Moreover, Johnson's letter published in last
Saturday's Times questioning the elimination of Gary Cunningham from
consideration for UCLA's athletic director position demonstrates that
he is as perceptive as he was athletic.</LD>
<LD>   As Johnson noted, Cunningham has everything that UCLA should be
looking for in an athletic director. Therefore, he obviously had to
be rejected if the Bruins were to continue on their current course of
mediocrity in the major sports.</LD>
<LD>   Bart Robertson</LD>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to one of my all-time heroes, Rafer Johnson,
a passionate advocate of Gary Cunningham for the UCLA athletic
director position, it is clear that Mr. Johnson is overlooking one
very salient fact regarding Gary Cunningham.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Cunningham is 62 years old and rapidly nearing retirement age.
Does it really make sense to hire an individual even if that
individual is eminently qualified, when he has at best a tenure of
maybe three or four years as UCLA's athletic director?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA needs young, competent and passionate blood in the position,
someone who will provide solid stability and leadership in this very
critical position for a long time to come.</TE>

<TE>   While second-guessing the Clippers' management and owner Donald T.
Sterling has become so popular on these pages, there is apparently
good reason for the team to remain under the salary cap. I don't
recall any departed players who went on to prove the team wrong, and
that includes Ron Harper, Danny Manning and the forward who demanded
$68 million for a long-term contract and whose name I cannot recall
(Maurice Taylor?).</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi has had a couple of good months, but can anyone
look Mr. Sterling in the eye and say this man has earned his past
salary, let alone is deserving of a long-term deal making him
mega-rich?</TE>

that the on-ice officials failed to give the upstairs video goal
judge the additional 30 seconds or so he needed to make a definitive
decision. Moreover, the referees refused, as they too often do, to
explain their ruling to Coach Murray.</LD>
<LD>   As a sports official myself, communication with players and
coaches is probably the most important part of my work. Stephane
Auger and Kerry Fraser's failure to extend this basic courtesy to
Murray suggests bias against the Kings, breeds sincere frustration
and represents arrogance and officiousness of the highest order.</LD>

the fact that an American runner set a world record at the London
Marathon on April 14. There was only a small blurb about the
race--which had one of the most exciting, talented rosters of any
marathon, ever--buried in the back pages of your sports section.</LD>

<LD>How do you know when it's a bad day? It's not when you play for the
Angels, one of the worst hitting teams (.220) in the major leagues,
already 71/2 games out of first place.</LD>
<LD>   It is when you play for the Angels and get benched because you're
batting .143 and leading the team in errors (three) and strikeouts
(13).</LD>

<TE>   It's a sad day when the Angels have become as pathetic in reality
as the Dodgers are on paper. Most of the players on the Angel roster
have talent, but hitting and winning is about attitude. Upper
management has done enough to improve the team, giving them an
everyday designated hitter and improved starting pitching. But it's a
shame that this team can get away with lackluster play because of the
failure of their manager, Mike Scioscia, and their hitting coach,
Mickey Hatcher, to light a fire under these guys.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher has made a mockery of what was once the pride of this team
(its ability to score tons of runs). Improvements must be made in
this team's attitude and its understanding of the urgency of playing
hard in every game. If Hatcher and Scioscia can't do it, then Disney
should find someone who can.</TE>

<LD>Chris Webber, Bobby Jackson and Hedo Turkoglu will return to the
Sacramento Kings' lineup for the playoffs after missing the final
game of the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   All three practiced and scrimmaged without limitations Friday,
Coach Rick Adelman said. Sacramento opens the playoffs today at Arco
Arena against the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't anticipate any problems," Adelman said. "Everybody should
play."</LD>
<TE>   Webber, the Kings' leading scorer and rebounder, sat out Wednesday
night's loss to the Lakers because of a sprained thumb. So did
Jackson, the Kings' sixth man, who went on the disabled list for the
game so the Kings could activate Brent Price.</TE>
<TE>   "My thumb is very sore, but now is the time of year that it's an
honor to play hurt," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu sprained his wrist during Tuesday's victory over Golden
State.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing the regular season with the NBA's best record,
Sacramento begins the postseason against the eighth-seeded Jazz,
which barely hung on for its 19th consecutive playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Webber said the Kings still remember their loss to the Jazz in the
first round of the 1999 playoffs, especially Utah's 99-92 overtime
victory in Game 5 at Salt Lake City. The Kings led that series, 2-1,
but the Jazz won Game 4 at Sacramento on John Stockton's
buzzer-beating jumper.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of those great series you remember for a while,"
said Webber. "Hopefully, we'll be able to say that if we hadn't lost
that series, we wouldn't have won this one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sportscaster Marv Albert was released from a Trenton, N.J.,
hospital one day after suffering a concussion in a car accident.</TE>
<TE>   The NBC and TNT announcer was also treated for a sprained ankle
and required stitches for a gashed tongue. He underwent precautionary
tests Friday morning, a hospital spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Albert and broadcast partner Mike Fratello were taken to the
hospital after their limousine struck a disabled truck at 2:55 a.m.
Thursday on an interstate. Doctors treated Fratello for minor
injuries and he was released Thursday morning.</TE>

<TE>   Allen Iverson practiced with the Philadelphia 76ers for the first
time since injuring his left hand nearly a month ago, but he didn't
participate in contact drills.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be examined in Boston today and hopes to be cleared by the
76ers' team doctor to play against the Celtics in Game 1 of the
Eastern Conference series on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Net guard Kerry Kittles missed Friday's practice
because of an upset stomach, but is expected to play in the team's
playoff opener today against the Indiana Pacers.... New York Knick
center Marcus Camby is being sued by a lawyer for $4 million for
allegedly backing out of a deal six years ago.... Knick guard Latrell
Sprewell said he has persuaded the team to slash his fine for missing

<HD>Patient Bruins Get Ready to Cash In</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Returning for senior seasons instead of
joining NFL helped raise draft stock of Foster, Thomas, Coleman and
Anderson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, several UCLA players made business decisions that carried
an emotional element regarding investments in a volatile futures
market known as the NFL, where predictions are difficult and risks
are many.</LD>
<LD>   They returned for their senior seasons, rather than making
themselves available for the draft.</LD>
<LD>   Results were mixed.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't go out the way they wanted; the team was 7-4 after a
late-season tailspin and did not play in a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   But it appears that the draft stock of most of the players went up
because they stayed in school and honed their skills.</TE>
<TE>   Even tailback DeShaun Foster improved his value, despite having
been suspended the last four games because of an NCAA extra-benefits
violation. NFL scouts apparently are more concerned with his
propensity to fumble than with his character, and he is projected to
be a late first-round or early second-round pick.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Robert Thomas, defensive end Kenyon Coleman and safety
Marques Anderson also are projected to go higher than they would have
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming back as a senior is rolling the dice because a player is
one injury away from it backfiring," said Bruce Lemmerman, a scout
for the Kansas City Chiefs. "It's an interesting decision-making
process. Some guys want one last year of the overall college
experience, others are convinced they can improve their draft status,
and others believe they need one more year of physical development or
consistent play."</TE>
<TE>   Getting drafted higher means a more lucrative signing bonus and
contract, so in a sense the four Bruins are already professionals,
having played their senior seasons for the difference between their
value a year ago and today.</TE>
<TE>   The amounts could be substantial. An average first-round pick the
last three years received a bonus of more than $4 million, whereas a
fourth-rounder got $290,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among UCLA and USC players, however, only Foster and Thomas are
projected as possible first-round picks, and both could slip to the
second round.</TE>
<TE>   Foster's elusiveness and 6-foot, 222-pound frame have long made
him an NFL prospect, and 2001 was his first injury-free season. But
he missed games after the NCAA suspended him for driving a Ford
Expedition that belonged to Hollywood director Eric Laneuville.</TE>
<TE>   In seven games, he rushed for 1,109 yards, averaging 5.1 yards
against defenses stacked to stop him. However, he fumbled four times
against Ohio State and his habit of carrying the ball away from his
body troubles scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that impressed me about DeShaun is his feet," said an
NFL scout who did not want to be identified. "They look a lot quicker
than last year. He has the ability to cut and accelerate out of his
breaks and make a gear change."</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Duckett of Michigan State and William Green of Boston College
are more highly regarded than Foster, and only the Cleveland Browns
and Philadelphia Eagles are expected to take running backs in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   As a service, the NFL informs any player contemplating leaving
school early of his approximate draft potential. Foster was told last
year he would have gone in the second or third round.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, who was told third through fifth, dramatically improved
his status by becoming an All-American a year after being burdened by
a stress fracture in his foot and 15 extra pounds. There are few top
linebackers available and he is expected to be one of the first
taken.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so explosive and plays with such passion," a scout said.
"Some teams absolutely love him."</TE>
<TE>   At 6-0, 230, Thomas is a bit undersized and some scouts predict he
will move from middle to weakside linebacker, meaning he must improve
on pass coverage. Others believe his quickness makes up for any size
deficiency in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman rebounded from a serious knee injury that caused him to
miss most of the 2000 season, impressing scouts with improved
mobility and sustained effort. Even though he may get lost in a long
list of desirable defensive ends, he could be picked in the third or
fourth round by a team convinced his injuries are behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Lott predicted years ago that Anderson would become an NFL
safety. And after outgrowing a reckless style that resulted in big
plays and big mistakes in about equal numbers, he is projected as a
fourth- through sixth-round pick.</TE>
<TE>   The top USC prospects also are defensive backs, although none are
projected to go before the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cash was the Trojans' steadiest cornerback and is the best
prospect, but a late-season knee injury raised concerns. Kris Richard
impressed coaches at the NFL combine in Indianapolis and Antuan
Simmons recently had a private workout with the San Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Other USC players who might be drafted are tight end Kori
Dickerson, linebacker Frank Strong, fullback Charlie Landrigan and
defensive linemen Lonnie Ford and Ryan Nielsen.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, despite its disappointing finish, has more prospects because
there were 23 seniors on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, tight end Bryan Fletcher, fullback Ed
Ieremia-Stansbury, long snapper Jeff Grau and defensive linemen Ken
Kocher and Anthony Fletcher could be drafted.</TE>
<TE>   Poli-Dixon is one player who might not have benefited from staying
for his senior year. A shoulder injury and Bruin passing woes limited
him to 24 catches.</TE>
<TE>   All seniors who might have gone out as juniors stayed for two
disparate reasons--making a championship run would be fun and
improving their draft status would be sound business.</TE>
<TE>   The title never materialized for the Bruins, but after today,
business could be booming.</TE>

<HD>No Super Bowl Pass</HD>
<DH>The Texans Will Take Fresno State's Carr With the First
Pick, but History Shows Drafting Quarterbacks Is an Inexact Science</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Texans will make Fresno State quarterback David Carr the
No. 1 pick in today's NFL draft. But there's a very good chance Carr
will never make the Texans No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 57 quarterbacks selected in the first round of the regular
and supplemental drafts since the 1970 merger with the old American
Football League, only four have won a Super Bowl with the teams that
drafted them. Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw did it. So did Chicago's
Jim McMahon, Dallas' Troy Aikman and the New York Giants' Phil Simms.</LD>
<LD>   Carr will be the 12th quarterback taken with the top pick since
the merger and the fourth in five years, following Michael Vick by
Atlanta in 2001, Tim Couch by Cleveland in 1999 and Peyton Manning by
Indianapolis in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The top four quarterbacks last season, according to the league's
passer ratings, were Kurt Warner of St. Louis, who was not drafted;
Rich Gannon of Oakland, fourth round; Jeff Garcia of San Francisco,
undrafted, and Brett Favre of Green Bay, second round. Not on that
list is New England hero and Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady, a sixth-round
pick in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it's just a crapshoot," said former San Francisco
coach Bill Walsh, widely considered one of the best judges of
quarterback talent in NFL history. Even for Walsh, scouting
quarterbacks is part skill and part luck.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Coach Brian Billick learned about that early in his
career, when he was a low-level assistant with the 49ers. He worked
the draft room at team headquarters in 1979, where he was entrusted
with keeping the coffee flowing and the doughnuts within reach. That
was the year Walsh drafted future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe
Montana. The milestone moment was, well ... nothing special.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no whooping and hollering, no 'Yeah! We got our guy!'"
recalled Billick, who 21 years later won a Super Bowl as coach of the
Ravens. "In fact, Bill jokingly said, because [Eddie DeBartolo, who
then owned the 49ers] was a Notre Dame guy, 'We'd better take the
Notre Dame guy because otherwise my butt is out of here.'</TE>
<TE>   "No one did that with the precognition that we just got the great
quarterback of the NFL. It just didn't go down that way."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans know much more about Carr than the 49ers did about
Montana. General Manager Charley Casserly likes Carr's size and
strength, and isn't bothered by his semi-sidearm delivery, which is a
bit unusual but apparently effective. Only nine of Carr's 533 passes
were intercepted last season. Equally important, Carr appears to be
mature and stable. He married his high school sweetheart three years
ago, and their son will be 2 next month.</TE>
<TE>   The other top quarterbacks in the draft are Joey Harrington of
Oregon--who could be selected as high as third, by Detroit--Patrick
Ramsey of Tulane, Kurt Kittner of Illinois, and Rohan Davey of
Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who now works as a consultant for the 49ers, likes the
6-foot-4 Harrington, although the 49ers have more pressing needs. The
math doesn't work anyway. Harrington could be among the top 10
players picked and the 49ers draft 27th.</TE>
<TE>   "[Harrington] has demonstrated just about everything," Walsh said.
"He's a great competitor with real poise. He's quick on his feet, and
he's proven himself to be a winner. He's a top-flight, can't-miss
quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   But, put simply, can't-miss quarterbacks often miss. Five were
selected in the first round three years ago--Couch by Cleveland,
Donovan McNabb by Philadelphia, Daunte Culpepper by Minnesota, Akili
Smith by Cincinnati, and Cade McNown by Chicago--yet only McNabb,
Culpepper and Couch proved themselves worthy of the investment. Smith
and McNown were busts. Notably, McNabb and Culpepper, the most
successful of the five, watched from the sideline most of their
rookie seasons. The three others played right away.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans recently signed veteran Kent Graham as their probable
starting quarterback. But the pressure will be intense to get Carr on
the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to be able to handle the bigness of this
league maybe sooner than some guys have," 49er Coach Steve Mariucci
said. "It will depend on whether he's going to get thrown to the
wolves immediately, which is a possibility, or is he going to be
allowed to develop gradually? A lot of it will depend on his
supporting cast."</TE>
<TE>   In order to keep him out of a plaster cast, the Texans will have a
lot of beef in their offensive line, beginning with tackles Tony
Boselli and Ryan Young. Almost as important, Mariucci said, is that
Carr plays on a team with a good defense.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's on a team that gives up a lot of points and he's having
to play from behind, and in the pocket more than he should be, it's
going to be difficult for any rookie quarterback to be in that boat,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The best rookie quarterbacks rarely are afforded that luxury.
Usually, they wind up on teams coming off lousy seasons. That was the
case with Jeff George, drafted No. 1 by then-woeful Indianapolis in
1990. He fizzled there, then bounced from Atlanta to Oakland to
Minnesota to Washington. Now, he's out of the league. In each city,
he rode in as the savior and rode out the sap.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but those whistling spirals were spectacular. Mouse Davis, his
quarterback coach in Atlanta, tells about working out George before
his rookie season, when Davis was a Detroit assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a puffy kid, an ugly sucker," Davis said. "He threw the
ball two or three times and I said, 'He's getting better looking.'
After he was done, I said, 'Gee, isn't he a beautiful kid?'"</TE>
<TE>   The same scouts who were enthralled with George projected Gannon
as a safety and Warner as a supermarket stock boy. Those same scouts
anguished over Drew Bledsoe vs. Rick Mirer, burned out their
calculators over Manning vs. Ryan Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   "What you can't evaluate about a quarterback is, how is he going
to react under pressure?" said Kansas City Coach Dick Vermeil,
considered an outstanding judge of quarterback talent. "How is he
going to throw with a man in his face? How is he going to make people
miss? There are a lot of kids, when it's seven on seven vs. air,
they're 70% or 80% complete. You take that quarterback and send a guy
coming right down his throat and it's different."</TE>
<TE>   Vermeil wears a Super Bowl ring in large part because of Warner,
who rose from the anonymity of the Arena Football League to lead St.
Louis to a championship in the 1999 season. Warner had to win over
everyone--even his coach--after starter Trent Green went down with a
season-ending knee injury. The Rams opened the 1999 regular season
against Baltimore, and Billick remembers Vermeil telling him the Rams
were simply trying to hang on with Warner until Paul Justin grasped
the offense well enough to step in.</TE>
<TE>   "We had concerns," Vermeil confessed. "I thought Kurt could play,
but I never projected he'd play like he played. Nobody could have
predicted that."</TE>
<TE>   George and Leaf had exceptionally strong arms, which left lots of
scouts ignoring all the fluttering red flags. Turns out, neither
player had the leadership skills to consistently rally an NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN analyst and longtime Philadelphia quarterback Ron Jaworski
doesn't think he would have made the same mistake the Chargers made
in using the No. 2 pick on Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were scouting a guy, I'd spend a week at the campus and take
his linemen out for dinner and beers," Jaworski said. "I'd get them
in a relaxed atmosphere, then ask them to really tell me about the
guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know Ryan personally. But I'm sure if I visited with his
offensive linemen in college, along the way I would have gotten the
inkling that this guy had a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Billick had the opposite feeling when he went to the airport to
pick up Montana mere hours after the 1979 draft had ended. It was a
late flight, and the two had never met. Still, Billick had no problem
spotting the young quarterback in a crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "When you met the guy, I can say there was a look in his eye that
I've only seen in a few people," Billick said. "There was a dead
calm. Not that glazed 'I have no idea what my name is right now'
look, but a real calmness. Bjorn Borg had that same look. It made you
feel like, 'Yeah, everything's going to be all right.'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Montana had to prove it on the field. As NFL scouts
know well, all the statistics, measurements, predraft interviews,
and, yes, even dead-calm expressions only point to a quarterback's
potential. And that brings to mind the words of longtime NFL coach
Bobby Ross: "Son, your potential is going to get me fired."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Vancouver Canucks were not giddy, they weren't even smiling after
defeating what's been regarded as the greatest show on ice.</LD>
<LD>   Five players scored for the Canucks in Friday's 5-2 victory that
gave them a sweep of the two games in Detroit over the team that had
the NHL's best record in the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   After winning their first playoff game since 1996 in Wednesday's
Game 1, the Canucks have now won two in a row for the first time in
seven years.</LD>
<TE>   The start to the best-of-seven first-round series has mirrored the
end of the regular season: Detroit won only one of its last 10 games,
while the Canucks were 8-0-1 in their last nine.</TE>
<TE>   "We played the last 10 games of the year like we were in the
playoffs because we couldn't afford to lose one game," said Vancouver
goaltender Dan Cloutier, who made 34 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Bertuzzi, Andrew Cassels, Scott Lachance, Markus Naslund and
Matt Cook scored for the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver, which never trailed, put the game away on Naslund's
goal with 1:52 left in the game to make it 4-2. Cook had an empty-net
goal moments later as the disgruntled crowd of 20,058 was already
filing out of Joe Louis Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, New Jersey 1--Bates Battaglia scored the game-winner
15:26 into overtime at Raleigh, N.C., and rookie Erik Cole had his
second goal in as many games as the Hurricanes took a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-seven first-round series.</TE>
<TE>   Battaglia's first career playoff goal came off a backhanded tip
after defenseman Marek Malik held in an attempted clearing play by
the Devils.</TE>

<HD>Hernandez Continues Sharp April</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Livan Hernandez has discovered the secret to a fast start.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez won his fourth consecutive outing despite another home
run by Lance Berkman, and the San Francisco Giants defeated the
Houston Astros, 3-2, at Houston on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Before this season, Hernandez (4-0) was 4-13 lifetime during March
and April in five seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "I changed my program this spring," Hernandez said. "I'm stronger
and I feel good. I did things differently. I ran more in the
off-season and it's worked. I've gotten in better condition each year
I've played."</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders hit a two-run double, and Rich Aurilia homered for
the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez pitched seven innings and gave up six hits, including
homers by Berkman and Richard Hidalgo. He struck out four and didn't
walk a batter.</TE>
<TE>   "Being 4-0 at this stage of the season is pretty awesome," Giant
Manager Dusty Baker said. "He's got more endurance, that's No. 1. He
also has more velocity, more movement."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman hit his ninth home run of the season, moving ahead of San
Francisco slugger Barry Bonds for the major league lead. Bonds
singled twice and drew three walks in five plate appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman's homer in the second made it 1-0. Shane Reynolds (2-2)
held off the Giants until the fifth, when Sanders doubled home two
runs with two out.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia hit his first homer of the season in the seventh. Hidalgo
homered in the bottom half.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   "You're ending up facing the meat of their batting order," Baker
said. "That was like a huge inning. He looked great."</TE>
<TE>   Nen struck out Brad Ausmus, Jeff Bagwell and Berkman to end the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "My slider was the best I've had all year, and my fastball has
been there all year but as far as location, it was as good tonight as
it's ever been," Nen said. "Today, they were both there and it was a
good time for them to come together against those three guys."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, Arizona 6--Todd Helton tripled twice and drove in four
runs at Phoenix as the Rockies ended a seven-game losing streak
against the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Helton's bases-loaded triple put the Rockies ahead, 7-3, in the
seventh inning. He then scored his third run on Todd Hollandsworth's
squeeze bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Helton hit two triples in each of the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norton had a two-run homer for the Rockies. His sacrifice
bunt in the sixth set up Benny Agbayani's grounder off Brian Anderson
(0-2), giving Colorado a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies were swept in a four-game series by Arizona at Coors
Field last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Neagle (2-1) gave up solo homers to Luis Gonzalez and Jose
Guillen.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, New York 3--Lee Stevens hit a three-run homer, and the
Mets made three errors, increasing their major league-leading total
to 24, as the Expos won at Montreal. Roberto Alomar, a 10-time Gold
Glove at second, made his first two errors of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Armas Jr. (2-2) gave up two runs--one earned--in 62/3
innings. Steve Trachsel (1-3), who defeated Armas on Sunday, gave up
four unearned runs in the third. Matt Herges pitched a perfect ninth
for his first save with the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Florida 2--Darren Holmes (1-0) won for the first time
since Sept. 7, 1999, with Arizona, and Chipper Jones hit a go-ahead
grounder in the eighth as the Braves overcame two Cliff Floyd homers
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer off Ryan Dempster (0-1), who got
his fifth complete game in 107 career starts. John Smoltz got his
fourth save, leaving the bases loaded in the ninth when Andy Fox
flied out.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Cincinnati 2--Matt Clement (1-2) matched his career
high by striking out 12 for the second game in a row, and Roosevelt
Brown hit a two-run homer to lead the Cubs at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Clement gave up only four hits over seven shutout innings. He also
had an RBI as he earned his first victory with the Cubs, who acquired
him from Florida late in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, St. Louis 1--Ruben Quevedo (1-1) ended a career-long
four-game losing streak and the Brewers won their second in a row
under interim Manager Jerry Royster.</TE>
<TE>   Quevedo gave up seven hits over 71/3 innings at Milwaukee as the
Brewers posted consecutive victories for the first time this season.
Luis Vizcaino got four outs for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 7, Philadelphia 4--Armando Rios' two-run single in a
four-run eighth inning lifted the injury-depleted Pirates over the
Phillies at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Division-leading Pirates squandered a three-run lead
but still won their fourth in a row to improve to 10-5--their best
start since opening 12-3 in 1992, when they won their last division
title.</TE>

<LD>John Mabee, a founding member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and
owner and breeder of top horses in California for more than 30 years,
was listed in critical condition Friday at the Palomar Medical Center
in Escondido after suffering a stroke earlier in the week.</LD>
<LD>   Mabee, 80, was breathing with the help of a respirator, according
to a statement from the Del Mar track. Mabee was discovered by his
wife, Betty, on Sunday, when he suffered his second stroke in two
years while showering at their Golden Eagle Farm in Ramona. Mabee has
been comatose since his recent stroke. In April of 2000, he was left
with minor speech problems after a stroke, but later returned to
running the family's breeding and racing operation on a limited
basis.</LD>
<LD>   Part of a group that took over the operation of Del Mar in 1970,
Mabee became track president in 1978 and in 1990 was elected board
chairman. Mabee resigned as chairman last November. Betty Mabee, an
active partner with her husband of 60 years in the Golden Eagle
operation, was elected to the Del Mar board in January.</LD>
<TE>   The Mabees won Eclipse Awards for champion breeder in 1991, 1997
and 1998. Their crowning achievement has been Best Pal, who when he
was retired in 1996 had won 17 stakes and earned $5.6 million.</TE>

<DH>Olympics: Refusal to disclose identity of athlete who
failed drug test has USATF facing probation vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>With behind-the-scenes efforts for a compromise quashed, the U.S.
Olympic Committee on Friday set the stage for a vote on the
politically charged issue of whether to put USA Track &amp; Field,
accused of failing to comply with anti-doping and accounting
procedures, on probation.</LD>
<LD>   Probation would, at the least, be an embarrassment. It could
ultimately lead to a revocation of Indianapolis-based USATF's status
as this nation's ruling agency for track and field.</LD>
<LD>   The core issue remains USATF's refusal to disclose the name of a
U.S. athlete who tested positive in 1999 for an anabolic steroid, was
exonerated by a USATF appeal board and then competed in the 2000
Sydney Summer Games.</LD>
<TE>   Also at issue, however, is a USATF bureaucracy that once failed to
include sprint star Michael Johnson's name on a list of athletes
eligible for out-of-competition drug testing, and that also,
according to a USOC report, "failed to cooperate on simple, basic,
essential, logistical requirements for in-competition testing."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Masback, USATF's chief executive, said Friday, "We're happy
to be part of the Olympic family. We think we have made a
contribution to the Olympic movement over the last 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We view this as part of the process of the USOC. If this is the
way the process unfolds, and if everyone is treated the same way, we
have no issues with it."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "We have complied, and will continue to comply."</TE>
<TE>   The measure up for a vote Sunday before the 123-member USOC board
of directors would formally revoke USATF's membership in the USOC and
its recognition as what is called a "national governing body" if by
Aug. 31 USATF "does not come into compliance" with anti-doping and
accounting procedures.</TE>
<TE>   USOC president Sandra Baldwin on Friday described the relationship
between the USOC and USATF as "very good" and "open." But, asked
about the unnamed athlete who competed in the 2000 Games, she said,
"The issue needs to be resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, it was announced that the dispute over release
of the athlete's identity will be referred to a special tribunal, the
Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot continue to accept a stalemate over this case," Lamine
Diack, president of the International Assn. of Athletics Federations,
track and field's worldwide governing body, said in a statement
released from the IAAF's Monaco headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Since September 2000, senior officials connected to the IAAF, the
International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the
World Anti-Doping Agency have pressed for release of the athlete's
name. USATF has said that rules in effect at the time of the 1999
test forbid it from identifying the athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "I must say I do not understand how in the interests of
doping-free sport there has not been more transparency in this
matter," Dick Pound, a Montreal attorney and IOC member who serves as
chairman of WADA, said in a recent interview. "The refusal to provide
the IAAF with the details in accordance with IAAF rules is
inexplicable."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion and chairman of
USADA, which since October 2000 has overseen the testing of athletes
in this country, added, "There's no legal grounds for privacy. End of
issue."</TE>
<TE>   No timetable has been set for the Court of Arbitration for Sport
to hear the case. If ordered by CAS to divulge the name, Masback
said, USATF will do so.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's name, meantime, was left off a USATF list of more than
500 athletes eligible for out-of-competition, no-advance notice
testing in the first three months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The list was submitted to USADA in November 2000. USADA noticed
the omission and added Johnson to the list. Thus, Masback noted in an
April 17 letter to the USOC, "there was never a time when the athlete
was not in the [no-advance notice] pool and eligible for testing."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the error took place when USATF was putting the list
of eligible athletes--which it got not from its own files but from
the magazine Track &amp; Field News--into the USADA's computer database
format.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mistake was a serious one for which we should be held
accountable," Masback said in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   USATF's problems with in-competition testing, he said, can be
traced to an "over-ambitious" 2001 program. It asked USADA to test at
21 events; the average U.S. governing body--meaning the agencies that
even in non-Olympic years supervise the 28 Summer Games
sports--tested at four events. USATF typically asked to test 41
athletes per event, well ahead of the average, 14 per event.</TE>
<TE>   Leading athletes were tested particularly frequently in 2001 by
USADA and the IAAF, Masback said. Sprinter and long jumper Marion
Jones and pole vaulter Stacy Dragila were each tested 12 times.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Masback said, USATF "did not devote sufficient
resources to guarantee adequate oversight of the 21 events," and will
do "whatever USADA or [the USOC] recommends to improve our
performance in this area."</TE>
<TE>   The USOC's review of USATF's financial and accounting procedures
identified four shortcomings--for instance, demanding that USATF
develop more consistency in the way it reports financial grants. The
review does not allege financial improprieties.</TE>

<TE>   Gauthier was the president and general manager of the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks, a hockey team that was once a cultural milestone, an
athletic team created from a movie that became cool and hip because
its colors were neato and its name was funny and because Disney knew
how to market so that a movie team and a real team melded into a
single team. This team filled an arena for years.</TE>
<TE>   Now it doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   The Pond doesn't rock anymore when the Ducks play. A season passed
and we barely noticed.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't all Gauthier's fault. He is just the best example of
what is wrong with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier made absolutely no impact on Orange County hockey fans in
his four-year tenure. He was not part of the community in any
noticeable way. He was anonymous. He tended to make statements that
weren't true, in the sense that soon after he'd said something
wouldn't happen, it happened.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Gauthier said he wouldn't think about firing his
coach. Then a month later, Craig Hartsburg was fired. He also said
he'd never consider trading the team's two superstars, Paul Kariya
and Teemu Selanne. Then, a month or so later, Selanne was traded and
the die-hards of the dwindling Duck fan base became rightly nervous
about Kariya's future in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier came here from Ottawa with a reputation as a fiscally
responsible, talent-savvy builder of teams. He was given credit by
his new bosses for building Ottawa into a low-payroll,
high-achievement playoff team and for being a key part of the early
Mighty Duck success as an assistant general manager in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It was a triumphant homecoming and Gauthier was supposed to
shrewdly snap up underappreciated, underpaid complementary parts to
go with Kariya and Selanne. And then Kariya and Selanne would charm
the nation with their brilliant speed and passing and scoring skills,
the role players would come along for the ride and the Ducks would be
big winners.</TE>
<TE>   This plan resulted in the Ducks finishing 25 points out of the
playoffs this season, a finish billed as a success by management
because it was an improvement over last season. Attendance dropped
continuously during Gauthier's time here. When he arrived in 1998, an
average of 17,068 went to the Pond. This season, it was 12,002. Since
the Ducks sneaked into the playoffs during Gauthier's first season,
they have missed postseason play three straight times. The last two
seasons, the playoffs weren't even a dream by December.</TE>
<TE>   A wiseacre suggested that since Disney is never averse to saving
money on its sports franchises, and since Angel General Manager Bill
Stoneman played in Montreal, and since hockey is pretty important in
Montreal, maybe Stoneman could be GM of both the Angels and Ducks,
Stoneman, after all, being pretty good at being an anonymous boss of
a bad team. So how hard would it be to be the boss of two bad teams?</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks aren't a joke. Nor are the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   What they are quickly becoming is invisible.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing worse for a sports franchise than to be uncared
about. Angry fans are better than uninterested fans. And the Ducks
and Angels are quickly becoming not worth caring about.</TE>
<TE>   How can a Duck fan be angry anymore? What's the point?</TE>
<TE>   When Gauthier came to Anaheim, he said he had a plan. It would
take three or four years of wise drafting and astute scouting. But
with Kariya and Selanne as the base, what Duck fans would get would
be a team built for longevity and several years of playoff success.</TE>
<TE>   What they got was a team that grew progressively worse.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, chairman of Disney's Parks and Resorts division,
the man in charge of the Ducks and Angels, said Friday, "We felt we
needed to have new leadership to get into the Stanley Cup playoffs.
We need a man with fantastic leadership skills and a great hockey
eye. It's very clear our fans are disappointed. I'm disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said he grew up an avid fan of the New York Rangers and
that he is, in fact, still a Ranger fan unless the Rangers are
playing the Ducks. So Pressler knows about fans who care. He knows
that the Rangers' model--paying big money for any big star (see Eric
Lindros)--did not work. The Rangers aren't in the playoffs, either.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks need to make a big move. The Ducks need scoring.
Selanne is available again. Bobby Holik is available. Maybe it's not
the Disney way and maybe it's not even the smart way, but the Ducks
need to make a statement, an extravagant one.</TE>
<TE>   Firing Gauthier isn't extravagant. If this news weren't in the
papers, no one would ever miss him. But signing a high-priced,
established scoring star is extravagant. The fans would care about
that. And they need something to care about. While there are still
fans out there to care at all.</TE>

<HD>Kapono Is Likely to Return</HD>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The impending return of All-Pacific 10 Conference forward Jason
Kapono for his senior season and the signing of McDonald's
All-American Evan Burns could leave UCLA with another roster logjam.</LD>
<LD>   Although Kapono said a published report that he would bypass the
NBA draft is erroneous, he is expected to eventually announce that he
will be back with the Bruins. He would lose his eligibility if he
declared for the draft, since it would be the second time he has done
so. The deadline to apply for the draft is May 12.</LD>
<LD>   "I am just not ready to make a decision or an announcement," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Assuming Kapono does return, Coach Steve Lavin could find it even
more difficult than last season to please everyone and come up with
effective combinations. By the end of the season, he had resorted to
five-player platoons.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably red-shirt guys to stagger their eligibility,"
Lavin said. Candidates to sit out are forward Andre Patterson, who
averaged 2.3 points and 2.1 rebounds as a freshman, and forward Matt
McKinney, a freshman from Santa Ynez who also is a national-caliber
volleyball player.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are starters Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes and Billy Knight and
sixth-man Rico Hines, all seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Back are center-forward T.J. Cummings, who will be a junior;
reserve post players Josiah Johnson and John Hoffart, and four
freshmen who had roller-coaster seasons--guards Cedric Bozeman and
Ryan Walcott, and forwards Dijon Thompson and Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Kapono led the Bruins in scoring at 16 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   The eight returnees will be joined by two veteran guards and four
freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Young, a senior who red-shirted last season, and junior Jon
Crispin, a transfer from Penn State who sat out last season, are
three-point shooting threats and NCAA tournament veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Burns, a 6-foot-8 forward from Fairfax High, freshmen
include 6-11 center Michael Fey of Olympia, Wash., who sat out last
season because of academic eligibility problems, and two-sport
athletes McKinney and Marcedes Lewis of Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is a tight end on a football scholarship and won't join the
basketball team until January if the Bruin football team plays in a
bowl game. UCLA has one more scholarship to give and is pursuing
forward Onye Ibekwe of Crenshaw High.</TE>

<HD>Tailbacks Have a Directive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The catch phrase for the USC offense during spring practice has been
"big-little."</LD>
<LD>   No more tailbacks hesitating in the backfield, looking to break a
touchdown run and too often risking a two-yard loss. Offensive
coordinator Norm Chow wants his ballcarriers to hit the hole fast and
get those "big-little" gains of three or four yards that keep a drive
going. All the better to set up a second- or third-and-short for
quarterback Carson Palmer who, given new freedom to move around the
pocket, has shown increasing command.</LD>
<LD>   There is still the matter of an offensive line that lacks depth
and struggled last season but, as spring workouts conclude with a
scrimmage today, the Trojans believe they have addressed their
shortcomings on offense so evident in a 10-6 loss to Utah in the Las
Vegas Bowl four months ago.</LD>
<TE>   "We needed to develop our style of running the football," Coach
Pete Carroll said. "Obviously, our chances have been enhanced by the
tailback situation we have."</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough is back after an abdominal injury sidelined him
midway through last season. Malaefou MacKenzie, who hasn't played in
a year, has been granted an extra season of eligibility. Perhaps most
important, Justin Fargas is ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans started the season tomorrow, all three backs would
play, Carroll said. But it is the quick, strong Fargas whose name
appears in bold letters atop the depth chart.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, sometimes the running game was struggling," said the
senior, who sat out after transferring from Michigan. "I felt like I
could get in there and make some yards and help the team win."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches hope the tailbacks can take pressure off a line that has
five returning starters and little else. With center Norm Katnik
headed for surgery after injuring his thumb this week, the same five
or six linemen will play for both squads in today's scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise Carroll spent much of his end-of-spring news
conference Friday talking about recruits Winston Justice and Fred
Matua. The situation, he said, requires the team to "ask our young
guys to work right in there. Our freshmen have to compete."</TE>
<TE>   There are similar depth problems on the other side of the ball,
where the Trojans were strongest last season but must replace both
cornerbacks, a linebacker and a defensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Simmons, a transfer from Washington State, used spring
practice to establish himself at linebacker. In the secondary, Kevin
Arbet has looked steady and Marcell Allmond, a converted receiver,
appears to be acclimating to his new surroundings. He would play
nickel back at this point.</TE>
<TE>   The other starter on the corner is Darrell Rideaux, a senior who
has speed but stands only 5 feet 9. Carroll has raved about his
improvement. The defense should get a lift from the return of
linebacker Matt Grootegoed and nose tackle Bernard Riley, both of
whom missed spring practice because of injuries but are expected at
training camp in August. In the meantime, Shaun Cody and Mike
Patterson have led the defensive front.</TE>
<TE>   The other big news has been punter Tom Malone from Temescal Canyon
High. He has boomed his kicks over the practice-field fence.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' Trade Is Talk of the Draft</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: L.A. sends starting point guard Figgs
to Portland and gets Teasley, the No. 5 overall pick, in return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not many teams figured to come away enriched by Friday's WNBA draft
but the Sparks might have.</LD>
<LD>   The defending league champions pulled off a surprising trade
afterward, sending starting point guard Ukari Figgs to Portland for
Nikki Teasley, the Fire's first-round pick. In the draft, the Sparks
selected Oklahoma guard Rosalind Ross with the 16th and final pick of
the first round. They chose Florida International guard Gergana
Slavtcheva and North Carolina forward Jackie Higgins in the second
round, Penn State forward Rashana Barnes in the third and Old
Dominion forward Tiffany Thompson with the last pick of the fourth
and final round.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the trade with Portland, the Sparks gave up Slavtcheva
and acquired veteran guard Sophia Witherspoon. But that wasn't the
move that had people talking.</LD>
<TE>   Teasley, the fifth player selected overall, averaged 14.6 points,
5.8 assists and 4.2 rebounds during her senior year at North
Carolina. She is the Tar Heels' all-time assist leader, was an
All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team selection and honorable
mention All-America. She was considered by many to be the top athlete
at guard in college last season.</TE>
<TE>   To get her, the Sparks said goodbye to one of their most popular
players, both with fans and the players. Figgs, a third-round pick
from Purdue in 1999, was solid and selfless at point guard during the
Sparks' title run last year. She averaged eight points and four
assists, but her accurate three-point shooting--54 for 117--kept
defenses from collapsing on Lisa Leslie and Latasha Byears under the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the toughest part, General Manager Penny Toler said, was
not being able to tell Figgs, who could not be reached by telephone.
"I wanted to keep Ukari," said Toler, blinking back tears. "She and
Tamika [Dixon] are my best friends. This is definitely hard. But how
can you pass up a 6-foot point guard?</TE>
<TE>   "Teasley is a phenomenal player. She sees the floor very well and
will be a huge addition to our team in a league that's getting better
and better. She was the only player I really liked, in addition to
the Sparks' players we already have."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Michael Cooper, who said Teasley "reminds me of Magic
Johnson," plans to insert the rookie into the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "She's played in a high-caliber program down in North Carolina,
she knows what big-game pressure is about, and I feel her style of
play fits our team," Cooper said. "But trading Ukari was one of the
hardest things we've ever had to do as an organization. She will be
sorely missed."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams are taking risks.</TE>
<TE>   Portland is getting an elite point guard to join Jackie Stiles,
last season's rookie of the year, in the backcourt. But it's
dangerous to trade within the same conference. If Teasley develops
into the player Cooper and Toler believe she will, the Fire will be
reminded of the deal for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is taking a chance on a talent who sat out the 2000-01
season because of depression and anxiety, and who must take daily
medication. She now has the pressure of fitting into a defending
champion at the game's most demanding position.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, who was at the WNBA draft in New Jersey, said by phone
that attending the league's pre-draft camp last week might have
erased some teams' doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the biggest things you can do for this day,"
Teasley said. "It's important for people to get to know you on a
personal level, and not just as a basketball player. I figured
wherever I was drafted, I would be happy. I'm very surprised to end
up with the Sparks. But I'm very happy."</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Seattle made Connecticut's Sue Bird the first pick.
And the national champion Huskies had the biggest impact on the
draft, with four players taken in the first six picks. Forward Swin
Cash was selected second by Detroit, forward Asjha Jones fourth by
Washington and forward Tamika Williams sixth by Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota traded former UCLA forward Maylana Martin and former
Master's College forward Erin Buescher to Charlotte for guard
Shaunzinski Gortman.</TE>

<HD>Valley City Could Survive on Own, Report Asserts</HD>
<DH>Secession: Only remaining hurdle to putting the issue on the Nov. 5
ballot is a vote next month by LAFCO, which is expected to support the
document.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Fernando Valley is financially robust enough to survive on
its own, a report released Friday concluded, clearing the way for a
possible November vote on whether to break up Los Angeles, the nation's
second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed Valley city would have 1.35 million residents, 14 city
council districts, an elected mayor, an airport and a $1-billion budget,
according to the report by the Local Agency Formation Commission. A
Valley city would be the nation's sixth largest, and Los Angeles, with
just 2.34 million people remaining, would fall to third place behind New
York and Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Valley cityhood now has another step to take before landing on the
ballot: a vote next month by the nine-member LAFCO board, which oversees
the creation of cities. If the board finds secession would not
financially hurt the Valley or the rest of Los Angeles, it could call for
a citywide vote as soon as Nov. 5.</LD>
<TE>   "The people of the city of Los Angeles and the people of the San
Fernando Valley will have a choice to make in November if LAFCO puts this
on the ballot, which I expect they will," said county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who sits on the state commission and heads a key secession
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   The report--a blueprint for splitting up the city--set the stage for a
contentious political campaign to come, a contest that both advocates and
critics have welcomed as a showdown over the shape of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic," said Richard Close, chairman of the secession group
Valley VOTE. "This will benefit everyone in the city, because everyone
will have smaller, more responsive government."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, led by Mayor James K. Hahn, disagree, saying that secession
will add to bureaucracy and do little to help either the breakaway areas
or the city that they are attempting to leave.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that L.A. is compensated for revenue lost with the departure
of a third of its residents and nearly half its land, a Valley city would
pay Los Angeles $55.8 million per year, an amount that would decrease by
5% a year, over a 20-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms laid out in the report, a new Valley city would launch
on July 1, 2003. During a transition period of one year, it would
contract with Los Angeles for essential services such as garbage
collection, police and fire protection, but could set up its own
departments after that.</TE>
<TE>   It would be shaped like an arrowhead, its bottom running along
Mulholland Drive and its top arching up through Chatsworth to Sylmar and
then jutting out into Sunland and Tujunga. It would completely surround
the tiny city of San Fernando, just as northern Los Angeles does now.</TE>
<TE>Utility Rates Would Be the Same in Valley, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would retain control of its water, power and sewer systems
beyond the transition period, and would continue to provide those
services to a Valley city. Utility rates paid by Valley customers would
be the same as those in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   City employees would decide for themselves whether they wanted to
apply to work in a Valley city. Collective bargaining agreements would be
honored, and most workers would keep their pensions. But about 5,100
police and fire employees could lose the money in their pension plans if
they transfer to the new city, because those pensions don't vest until
employees have been with the city for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Airport, which is owned and operated by Los Angeles, would
become the property of the new city, pending approval from the Federal
Aviation Administration. Most parks, libraries, police and fire stations
would also transfer to the new city.</TE>
<TE>   The new city would also get some of Los Angeles' cash reserves, but
would have to overcome an $18-million shortfall the first year through
either a hiring freeze, borrowing or new fees.</TE>
<TE>   The report questioned the Hahn administration's contention that larger
cities provide services more cheaply, suggesting instead that Los Angeles
would save money if the Valley were jettisoned.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO is widely expected to adopt the report, perhaps with minor
changes, at its meeting May 15. The secession proposal would then go to
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which must place it on the
ballot if asked to do so by LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   A secession election would be held citywide. To win, the proposal must
be approved both by a majority of voters within the Valley and a majority
citywide. The commission is also considering separate secession measures
for Hollywood and the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   "My recommendation is that it should go forward," said Larry Calemine,
executive director of the commission and the author of the report.</TE>
<TE>   In the works for 2 1/2 years, the report could provide fodder for both
sides in the secession election campaign, which already has begun in
earnest. Hahn, joined by former Mayor Richard J. Riordan, City Council
members, the heads of most labor unions and some of the city's leading
power brokers, has sworn to fight secession, which grew out of the
Proposition 13 and antibusing movements in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a community can only secede from a city or county if
a study such as the one released Friday shows that it can survive on its
own. In addition, if the community's departure would harm the remaining
city or county, it must pay an annual fee--known colloquially as an
alimony payment--to the part of town left behind.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the mayor focused on the potential negative effects of
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what many believe, Hahn said, breaking apart the city will
not split up the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Secession "will likely mean reduced services for the new city and it
will harm the remaining neighborhoods of Los Angeles," the mayor said.
"It means more bureaucracy, more politicians, fewer resources and fewer
services."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Daar, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles,
criticized the report, saying that it ignores key questions about the
cost and quality of services in a new city.</TE>
<TE>   He also said his group would petition LAFCO to change the way the
election would be handled. According to the report, a Valley council and
mayor would be elected on the same November ballot as the secession
question. But that, Daar said, would distract voters from the real issue
of whether secession would be appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Although the secession movement started in the Valley, it has expanded
over the years to include proposals for the harbor area and Hollywood,
which might also go on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a Times poll showed that 55% of registered voters in the
Valley and 46% of voters citywide favored secession for the San Fernando
Valley, an increase of 10 points citywide over the previous year.</TE>
<TE>Black Voters Could Be Key in Decision</TE>
<TE>   Secession also picked up steam recently thanks to an unlikely alliance
between secession proponents and some of the city's African-American
leaders, who are angry about the decision not to reappoint Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Their frustration could be key to the measure's success, said William
Fulton, president of the consulting group Solimar Research of Ventura and
a noted expert on Los Angeles history and politics.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an odd alliance of white citizens who want to leave and
African Americans who want them to leave," he added. "That will be an
interesting political strategy that Valley secessionists will have to
mount."</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns, Fulton said, "will have to go after the hearts and
minds of African Americans. They will become the most important voting
bloc in this election."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley joined Los Angeles in 1915 in order to use water brought in
through the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct. Although the water gushed
through the San Fernando Valley on its way to L.A., Valley residents
could not use it unless they annexed themselves to the larger city.</TE>
<TE>   But under rules laid out in Friday's report, if Valley residents quit
the city now, they'll have their water--and at the same price Los Angeles
residents pay for it.</TE>

<HD>Time Is Running Out for Thousands on Welfare</HD>
<DH>Aid: Recipients will face loss of money, benefits as they reach the
state's new 5-year limit on assistance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>More than 110,000 welfare recipients--roughly half from Los Angeles
County--will lose money and other government aid next January when
California's welfare-to-work program begins to cut benefits to poor
families that reach a five-year lifetime limit on assistance.</LD>
<LD>   Like other welfare reform efforts across the country, the CalWORKS
program seeks to move as many people as possible off state welfare rolls
and into the world of work. It has been more successful than many
anticipated, thanks in part to a strong economy for much of the time that
allowed welfare recipients to find work and leave welfare.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, fewer welfare recipients are expected to hit the lifetime
limit than many initially feared. Under federal law, the limit takes
effect automatically for most welfare recipients when they receive aid
for 60 months. Because CalWORKS was not implemented until 1998,
California welfare recipients will not start hitting the limit until
2003.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the long-term consequences of time limits in the nation's
most populous state are expected to be significant, and thus are being
closely watched as an indicator of the challenges still facing welfare
reform nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Several other states already have extended some or all of the benefits
that welfare recipients were to lose when the limits took effect by
paying for them with state funds instead of federal dollars. And some
California legislators, concerned about the personal and economic impacts
of the limits, are introducing similar bills intended to soften the blow.</TE>
<TE>   Although they will lose only the adult's portion of their family
grants, more families are expected to be affected by welfare time limits
in California than anywhere else in the nation. And like those in other
states, most California parents expected to hit the limits share a common
characteristic--they have found at least some work, but their jobs pay
too little to support their families.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the adults expected to lose assistance in January
are already employed, but still would fall near or below the federal
poverty line without government assistance. The average single-parent
family on welfare is expected to lose about $130 a month.</TE>
<TE>   For many, that represents roughly a fourth of their household
government income.</TE>
<TE>   "The jobs that people are getting just don't allow them to leave aid.
They are not making enough to become independent," said Casey McKeever of
the Western Center on Law and Poverty. "That was an inherent problem with
CalWORKS. There was not an effort to make sure these people would get
jobs that allowed them to meet basic needs."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Social Services is combing the welfare rolls
to determine how many people will be affected by the time limits. It
recently estimated that 114,000 adult welfare recipients from 94,000
households--roughly 18% of the CalWORKS population--will reach the
lifetime limit at the start of next year.</TE>
<TE>   An average of 1,300 families will then hit the limit every month
thereafter and will see their benefits cut as they do. Most live in Los
Angeles County, which alone has a larger welfare caseload than 48 of the
50 states. In Orange County, officials estimate that roughly 3,000
welfare recipients will lose aid at the start of next year. In Ventura
County, the early estimate is 775.</TE>
<TE>   The state's preliminary analysis points to other problems that will
make further reducing welfare rolls difficult. Notably, it found that
many of those who have not found work or are working but still need
assistance are immigrants who do not speak English. Statewide, 35% of the
adult recipients who are expected to hit the limits do not speak English
as their primary language. In Alameda County, 64% primarily spoke a
language other than English.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of such losses will likely be drawn out over time, some
experts say, starting with such red flags as occasionally missing rent
and utility payments. But others predict more immediate--and
severe--social and economic consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Those families are going to become homeless," said Bob Erlenbusch,
executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger &amp;
Homelessness. "They are using the cash grant for rent, because rents are
so high. They are using that cash grant to live. I would challenge
anyone, starting with the governor, to explain how this is not going to
result in increased homelessness."</TE>
<TE>Single Mother of Four Struggles to Survive</TE>
<TE>   The cut in benefits will prove particularly difficult for recipients
such as Charlenta Howard, a 38-year-old single mother of four from
South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, who said she "never worked a day in my life" until 1999, tried
but was unable to maintain a $7-an-hour job as a dispatcher with a
security guard company because her two oldest children began getting into
trouble and giving in to the temptations of gang life.</TE>
<TE>   The two children, who became too old to qualify for state subsidized
child care when they entered their teens, are now both in juvenile
detention facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Howard has struggled to find a place to live with her other two
children, ages 6 and 11. She has no idea how she will pay her $495
monthly rent and other bills when she loses the adult portion of her $635
family welfare aid.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about what I am going to do," she said, "because
it is all . . . necessary when it comes to taking care of my children.
When you don't know [how you will] pay the bills, you don't know what you
might do."</TE>
<TE>   California has created a so-called safety net to diminish the impact
of the benefits cutoff. Thus, some experts say, recipients here will be
better protected than those in other states. Though adults will be
removed from the rolls, for example, their children will remain eligible
for aid. Also, parents losing cash aid as a result of being forced out of
the welfare system will be able to receive child-care services for two
years. Furthermore, state officials point out that although many welfare
recipients remain in poverty despite having found work, data suggest they
are now on the right path thanks to welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   "That job experience, even if you are not making above poverty
[wages], is putting you on the road" to financial independence, said
Genie Chough, an assistant secretary with the state's Health and Human
Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The results of California's experience with welfare reform are being
closely watched by welfare experts around the country--not only because
of the state's size, but also because its remarkable racial and ethnic
diversity and mix of urban, suburban and rural communities make it a
unique laboratory for welfare policy.</TE>
<TE>   All states were required to implement time limits on assistance as
part of the federal government's welfare reforms under President Clinton
in 1996. At least 50% of all welfare recipients also were supposed to
participate in some form of work or work-related activity. But many
states have found that although recipients find employment as a result of
government training programs and education, the work is often unreliable
or menial.</TE>
<TE>   In response, a growing number of states, including Illinois and
Washington, have either "stopped the clock" on time limits or extended
benefits to families that "played by the rules" by undergoing training
and finding jobs, said Shawn Fremstad, a senior policy analyst with the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have are families who are pretty close to the edge
anyway--80% to 90% are below the poverty line--and there is no longer the
ability to go back on welfare" without an extension of benefits, Fremstad
said. "Those grants are really kind of subsidizing them on these low-wage
jobs, but yet their clock is ticking."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), a leading advocate of
enhancing welfare benefits in California, has introduced legislation that
would stop time from being counted against state welfare recipients who
are meeting work requirements. Her bill, AB 2116, also would provide
exemptions for programs the state vowed to fund at a certain level but
has since cut or may soon eliminate. Child-care and transportation
programs, for instance, could be restored or protected. Aroner's bill
also would exempt recipients in entire regions where unemployment rates
are 10% or more, making job prospects for welfare recipients hard to come
by.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) is pushing a measure that
would extend an existing two-year limit on educational opportunities to
let welfare recipients continue their schooling. And Assemblywoman Ellen
Corbett (D-San Leandro) has introduced legislation to extend that same
education limit for welfare recipients studying to become nurses, citing
the state's shortage of skilled nurses.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, those bills would allow welfare recipients to continue
drawing aid while pursing their schooling. The states' efforts to deal
with the effects of the limits come at a time when the Bush
administration is trying to remake the nation's welfare policy to put
more emphasis on work. It has proposed increasing the number of hours
welfare recipients must work from 30 to 40 hours per week, and raising
the percentage of welfare recipients who must be involved in work-related
activities from 50% to 70% by 2007. States that do not meet the
requirements could lose federal money.</TE>
<TE>Welfare Agencies Face New Challenge</TE>
<TE>   With time ticking for thousands of welfare recipients, the already
swamped county agencies that administer most welfare programs now face a
new challenge: They must inform scores of people that their aid is coming
to an end, and try to ensure that they receive all the services they can
before their time expires.</TE>
<TE>   A recent state survey, to which 51 of the state's 56 counties
responded, found that most counties were working to alert recipients that
their benefits were going to end. Forty counties were performing
case-file reviews and computer runs to determine who will soon reach time
limits. Thirty counties were providing ongoing notices and telephone
calls to recipients to alert them that their time was coming to a close,
and 28 counties were making home visits.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, officials have compiled an initial list of
49,000 families and 58,000 individual welfare recipients who are at risk
of exhausting their lifetime limit on assistance in January.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are a "maximum worst-case situation" and should be
"substantially lower" after county officials interview welfare recipients
and grant them extra time for months when they did not use up
eligibility, said Eileen Kelly, the chief of the county's welfare-to-work
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Los Angeles families, 44% were earning some sort of income in
December, and the average age of the adults was 39. Those whose primary
language was not English appeared more likely to hit the time limit,
especially if their native tongue was Cambodian, Chinese or Vietnamese,
officials concluded.</TE>
<TE>   County officials are distributing lists to case managers of all the
welfare participants in their caseload who are likely to hit the limits.
The case managers are expected to invite them to a voluntary workshop to
discuss their situations. The county also is developing a series of
outreach materials such as videos and brochures to educate welfare
recipients on the services still available to them.</TE>
<TE>   Having to disseminate the information in 28 languages is a monumental
task, Kelly said. But the county is taking seriously its responsibility
to ensure that welfare recipients know that the end of aid is fast
approaching. "We certainly are doing everything we can so that no one
will be shocked," she said. "That would be unconscionable."</TE>

<HD>FBI Warns Banks of Terrorist Threat</HD>
<DH>Security: The alert to Northeast institutions is based on
information from an Al Qaeda leader held by the U.S., who may have reason
to lie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The FBI, acting on information from a captured senior aide to Osama
bin Laden, warned banks and financial institutions throughout the
Northeast on Friday that they face the threat of terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Zubeida, a senior Al Qaeda commander who was captured in Pakistan
last month, indicated to military officials in interviews in recent days
that Bin Laden's terrorist network is "very interested in [hitting] the
financial sector" in the United States, according to a government
official who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first indication that the Saudi-born Zubeida, after three
weeks in detention, is actively cooperating with his captors, which would
mark a dramatic breakthrough in efforts by the United States to penetrate
and break the Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<TE>   But Zubeida could be trying to spread disinformation to keep the
United States off the scent of real terrorist plots, authorities
acknowledged. They cautioned that the threat to Northeastern banks is
"unsubstantiated" and that it did not warrant raising the nationwide
threat level. The current "yellow" warning level, third in the
government's new five-tier system, means there is a significant risk of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the threat has triggered deep concerns within the Bush
administration about the prospect of a fresh round of attacks, seven
months after the Sept. 11 hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Top administration officials--including Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, CIA
Director George J. Tenet and Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge--met at
the White House Friday morning to discuss the threat to the financial
industry before deciding to have the FBI issue its midafternoon alert,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was discussed at the highest levels, and it's being taken very
seriously, no doubt," a law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI warned that the government had "received unsubstantiated
information that unspecified terrorists are considering physical attacks
against U.S. financial institutions in the Northeast, particularly banks,
as part of their campaign against U.S. financial interests."</TE>
<TE>   Although the FBI "has no specific information about any specific plot
or threats to any specific institution," the warning said, "out of an
abundance of caution an alert has been transmitted to law enforcement and
to financial institutions in the Northeastern states of Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and the
District of Columbia."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are trying to corroborate Zubeida's information through
independent means, and some in the intelligence community are skeptical
about its veracity because Al Qaeda members are notorious for using
disinformation as a weapon to hide their intentions.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because he's uttering words doesn't make it true. He might be
telling us what he thinks we want to hear, and all of that has to be
considered," said a government official who also asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing that skepticism, a White House official said: "We have to be
very concerned that he [could be] putting out disinformation. It would
only be a logical step for this guy. For someone like him to turn state's
evidence and tell all, it would be rather surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Ahmed Ressam [a fairly low-level Al Qaeda operative
convicted in a planned millennium bombing at Los Angeles International
Airport], or some other soldier who decides to talk. He is one of the top
figures in the entire Al Qaeda organization."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has issued more than a dozen terrorist-related alerts since
September, warning about potential threats during specific time periods
or involving certain industries, such as hazardous material haulers or
crop-dusters.</TE>
<TE>   Some frustrated local police officials and politicians have criticized
the federal warnings, saying they serve only to alarm people. But
Ashcroft, defending the policy during an appearance Friday in Pittsburgh,
said alerting the public to "threat information that merits their
attention," even if uncorroborated, can serve to prevent and disrupt
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not asking the banks to close, nor urging people to stay away
from banks. We are alerting law enforcement, financial institutions and
the American people to be vigilant and to be aware of anything that
appears suspicious," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. stock prices dipped briefly after word of the FBI warning but
soon recovered, and many financiers appeared to take the news in stride
in the post-Sept. 11 climate of ever-present caution.</TE>
<TE>   There were no immediate reports of bank closures, unlike the chaos in
Washington on Monday when a bomb threat prompted most of the city's
several hundred banks to shut their doors on tax deadline day.
Authorities later determined that the anonymous threat--reporting that a
bomb would be detonated at noon at a bank--had been phoned in by a
13-year-old boy in the Netherlands. The boy confessed to the hoax.</TE>
<TE>   Banking industry executives said many Northeastern institutions will
likely step up security in the coming days in response to the FBI
warning.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no specific date or single target identified, it is
unlikely any banks will rush to close their doors in response to this
latest threat, said Karen Thomas, director of regulatory affairs for the
Independent Community Bankers of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Each bank will have to decide for itself [how] to respond, but I
think you'll see an increase in security and due diligence all around."
Even if the threat is vague and unspecified, she said, "I think people
would rather know about it so they can take appropriate steps."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they were taking Friday's threat seriously because of
the prominent source.</TE>
<TE>   Although the FBI warning did not name Zubeida, law enforcement and
government sources said statements from Bin Laden's field operations
coordinator provided the key piece in a puzzle of interlocking
intelligence information suggesting that Northeastern banks could be in
danger.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida was captured March 28 during an early morning commando raid,
when U.S. and Pakistani authorities stormed a gated and razor-wired
two-story house in Faisalabad, Pakistan, and engaged in a rooftop
shootout with several Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida was shot at least three times and was seriously wounded as he
attempted to escape. He was handed over within days to U.S. authorities,
who began intensively interrogating him. Officials deny allegations that
he was tortured during the interrogations, noting that U.S. law prohibits
torture of any prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials regard Zubeida as such an important prize that they
refuse even to divulge where he is being held. They have said he is the
first prime candidate to face trial by military tribunal, where he would
face almost certain execution if convicted, given his alleged role in
many of Al Qaeda's most devastating attacks in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials say that Zubeida is
perhaps third only to Bin Laden and top lieutenant Ayman al-Zawahiri in
the Al Qaeda hierarchy and that he is suspected of playing a role in the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida also helped link Bin Laden's inner circle with scores of
terrorist groups in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   And after military strikes forced the Al Qaeda leadership and the
Taliban regime to flee last fall, officials said, Zubeida was entrusted
with rebuilding the global terrorist organization and plotting terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The White House official said Zubeida's apparent cooperation is a
major breakthrough in determining where Al Qaeda members are holed up and
what they may be plotting.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one man who knows the majority of what Al Qaeda is up to,
it is him. It is conceivable that he knows even more than Bin Laden and
Zawahiri," said the official, who asked not to be identified. "If he ever
decides to fully cooperate, he could do more to unveil the global
workings of the Al Qaeda network than just about anyone else."</TE>

<HD>'Three Years of Hell' for Colo. Sheriff</HD>
<DH>Columbine: With the killers dead, John Stone became the scapegoat
in the school massacre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>It was always his dream to be a small-town sheriff in the
California mountains. Instead, John Stone became sheriff of Colorado's
largest county. And four months into the job, he was leading the
investigation of a national tragedy: the deadly shooting at Columbine
High School.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Stone has been called incompetent and pathetic. He's been
given the nickname "Sheriff Stonewall." And the credibility of his
investigation into the massacre has been questioned.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare interview Friday, the eve of Columbine's anniversary, Stone
spoke from his office here with resignation about the three years since
two teen gunmen opened fire on their classmates.</LD>
<TE>   "There is the initial shock, the grieving, the cleanup, the reporting
and the ugly stage," said Stone, 52. "We are in the ugly stage. Still. I
ended up being the most visible person in this case. That's where the
blame is focusing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Stone has become the Western sheriff who's being run out of
town; he recently announced he will not seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The grief from the killing of 12 students and one teacher at Columbine
has spread well beyond the dead. Families have been driven to the edge of
bankruptcy caring for severely injured children, marriages have imploded
from stress and school officials have struggled to account for the
bullying atmosphere they allowed at their award-winning suburban campus.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff, charged with protecting the people of Jefferson County,
has been a handy scapegoat for it all. Still, during three years of
relentless second-guessing, Stone rarely has taken on his media critics,
deciding he "couldn't win a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel."</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing took on a life of its own," said Stone, at times
bitter. "There's nothing left to say; it's been rehashed and rehashed.
But life's too short. The toll this is taking on my health has been
horrible. I don't want to be always looking over my back."</TE>
<TE>   To his defenders, Stone has unfairly borne the brunt of a community's
unresolved issues. All the while, they say, Stone was dealing with his
own pain brought up by the attack: the memory of his 15-year-old son's
suicide years before.</TE>
<TE>   "The man has been publicly pilloried and burned; it's appalling," said
Bill Skewes, chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party. Because
the two gunmen took their lives, Skewes said, there was no one to punish
after the massacre.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally in circumstances like this, the bad actors are around to be
punished," he said. "But they took their lives, and the people who lost
their children have nobody to take it out on, to see justice is done.
It's a natural human response. They have taken it out on Stone. They have
attacked him unmercifully."</TE>
<TE>   But for many Columbine families, there is no forgiving the sheriff.
They say he botched the rescue, bungled the investigation and withheld
vital information.</TE>
<TE>   He was criticized for overestimating the casualties in the first hours
after the attack, but Stone says he was passing on the information he had
at the time. The day after the massacre, Stone hypothesized that the two
gunmen had three accomplices and he incorrectly named another teenager as
a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   If he erred, Stone said, it was in sharing his theories with the
media.</TE>
<TE>   The second-guessing started even before the stand-off concluded.
Officers were called cowards for taking three hours to enter the school;
the delay resulted in a teacher bleeding to death in a science room.
Stone defended the officers' actions, noting that police were being fired
upon. The response was "by the book," at least as it was written at the
time, Stone said. There was no template for dealing with a school siege.
Now there is, and he helped design it, Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   By far, the most withering criticism has come from victims' families.
They repeatedly have asked for information about the attacks, especially
anything that could shed light on how their loved ones died or were
wounded. The sheriff's office, they say, has steadfastly refused to share
those details.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said he has released all the information he can.</TE>
<TE>   But even formerly neutral observers denounced Stone last summer after
he refused to testify before Colorado Gov. Bill Owens' Columbine
commission. The commission's sober-minded chairman lashed out at Stone.</TE>
<TE>   "He provided no information and stonewalled our commission," said
William Erickson, former chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson's widely published comments begat the nickname "Sheriff
Stonewall," now in common use here.</TE>
<TE>   The whole incident was not only damaging, Stone said, it was
politically motivated. He said his investigators extensively briefed the
commission once, but the panel insisted on having Stone testify again in
a televised session.</TE>
<TE>   Stone said the then-county attorney advised him that if he testified
this time, he and all his deputies would lose their immunity from
prosecution. That led to the "refusal to testify" criticism.</TE>
<TE>   That background story, Stone said, was known to those involved and
never told to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Stone has never defended himself against attacks by victims' families,
a group almost impossible to respond to without appearing monstrously
insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Rohrbough, whose son Daniel was shot while fleeing the school,
has filed two lawsuits against the sheriff's office, seeking details of
the boy's death.</TE>
<TE>   Because of questions surrounding Daniel's death, Stone asked the
neighboring county to determine who killed the boy. That information
finally arrived Wednesday. Rohrbough, a quietly intense man, stood
outside the Jefferson County government complex and spoke bitterly about
Stone.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did this take three years?" Rohrbough asked reporters. "You
should walk over to Sheriff Stone's office and shove a microphone down
his throat and force him to answer that."</TE>
<TE>   If he has had no other effect on the community, the sheriff has
certainly radicalized a group of drowsy suburbanites.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the most boring people you'd ever want to meet before
Columbine," said Randy Brown, whose son, Brooks, was the subject of death
threats by gunman Eric Harris. Brooks Brown was named by Stone as a
suspect, although he never was.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like everyone else, we went to school events, drank lattes.
We didn't believe in conspiracies. But this was a cover-up from the
start. Stone has been awful, just pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   Brown and his wife, Judy, who launched a failed recall campaign
against Stone last year, are such frequent critics that Stone joked: "No
matter what I do, [reporters] have to get Mr. Brown's opinion. When I
die, they are going to ask Mr. Brown, 'That SOB is dead, what's your
reaction?' "</TE>
<TE>   Stone has been in public life long enough to know what comes with the
job. He became a campus police officer at 18, then moved to Palo Alto,
where he was a patrolman. Stone then joined the robbery-homicide unit in
Lakewood, a Denver suburb. He left the force and served 12 years as a
Jefferson County commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   He says he understands the caprice of public opinion and he knows that
those who blame him will never let go. He realizes that his name and
reputation will forever be associated with the rampage of two disturbed
teenage boys.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting pounded," said Stone, who is raising his teenage
daughter on his own. "Columbine has overshadowed everything. For three
years you pick up a paper and your face is there or you're mocked in a
cartoon. My daughter has to see all this."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Johnson has known Stone for 16 years and served as treasurer in
three of Stone's campaigns. He said the man he knows as a scuba diver and
sailor has been misrepresented, mainly by the media.</TE>
<TE>   "The press has totally, totally abused this man," Johnson said. "John
always gives the impression that he has thick skin. But the opposite is
true. I know he's not slept nights. He keeps evaluating what he could
have done differently. It's been three years of hell."</TE>

<HD>Canada Wants Answers in 'Friendly Fire'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA
</DL>
<LD>Flags fluttered at half-staff here in Canada's capital Friday to
honor four infantrymen killed by a bomb from a U.S. warplane, the first
Canadian combat troops to die in the line of duty in half a century.</LD>
<LD>   But the initial shock over the incident early Thursday in southern
Afghanistan was giving way to skeptical and even angry questioning about
the terms--and costs--of Canada's military collaboration with the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian soldiers, members of an elite unit fighting alongside
American troops near the city of Kandahar, were killed by a 500-pound
bomb apparently dropped in error by an Air National Guard F-16 pilot.
Eight other Canadians were wounded.</LD>
<TE>   The "friendly fire" deaths have brought to the surface feelings here
that Canada has become an underappreciated and perhaps under-equipped
junior partner in a superpower's global adventures.</TE>
<TE>   "The symbolism, for those who think we have no business being in
Afghanistan, is too rich to miss," prominent journalist Margaret Wente
wrote in a front-page column in Friday's Globe and Mail newspaper. "We
went to help out the Americans with their war--and they used us for
target practice."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, as Prime Minister Jean Chretien somberly informed
Parliament about the accident, most opposition politicians refrained from
questioning the government's controversial decision to contribute an
880-member unit to the Afghanistan coalition commanded by U.S. generals
in Tampa, Fla., and dominated in the field by U.S. air power and
high-tech ground weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   They did not challenge the government's accounting of the U.S.
response to the incident--President Bush's condolence call to the prime
minister, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's promise of a swift
investigation--which portrayed relations with Washington as still close
and collegial. The leaders of the Canadian Alliance and Parti Quebecois
crossed the aisle to shake hands with the visibly distressed Liberal
Party prime minister, who vowed to keep Canadian troops in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   One pointed and surprising exception was Joe Clark, the Progressive
Conservative Party leader, a normally pro-American former prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   "War is always unpredictable, but Canadians would want to know what
were the exact circumstances that led to Canadians being killed by
friendly fire," Clark said. "Did the arrangement whereby American
commanders direct Canadian troops have any impact on these casualties?"</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Canada's other parties joined the fray. Defense Minister
Art Eggleton was grilled by opposition leaders in Parliament about the
extent of promised U.S. collaboration with Canada's investigation into
the incident. Would the Americans share all their documents? The
depositions of all their personnel?</TE>
<TE>   Canadian commentators, unimpressed by Chretien's report of his
Wednesday night telephone call from the U.S. president, noted with some
bitterness that Bush had failed to voice regret or dismay about the
deaths in any of his public appearances Thursday. He might not have
mentioned the incident at all, it was widely noted here, if it had not
been for the shouted question of a Canadian reporter--to whom Bush
responded by saying he had called Chretien on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Canadians know tragic accidents happen," wrote Paul Wells, a National
Post columnist. "They also know what outrage would ensue if the situation
were reversed--if our snipers had killed U.S. soldiers--and our own
leaders could offer the Americans no public display of remorse."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials also expressed concern. "I think, undoubtedly, it
would have been a comfort to the families to hear the president's own
words through the media," said Deputy Prime Minister John Manley.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian sensibilities were assuaged later Friday when Bush, Rumsfeld
and State Department spokesman Richard Boucher publicly voiced regret
about the incident. "It was a terrible accident," Bush said. "We
appreciate so very much the sacrifices that the Canadians are making in
the war against terror."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, after the deaths in Afghanistan and with reports here
that the Pentagon is planning more direct surveillance of Canadian land
and sea borders, there is a growing backlash in centrist political
circles here against military subordination to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, the bombing near Kandahar came just hours after an
announcement in Washington that the Pentagon is creating a new North
American military command--an initiative that appears to have taken much
of Canada's political leadership by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Eggleton said later that his ministry had been kept apprised of the
plans. But he has declined to comment on reports confirmed by U.S.
officials here of an open U.S. offer for more direct regional
coordination with the Canadian army and navy. Other Liberal politicians
oppose any such arrangement as an infringement on Canada's sovereignty,
as does the leftist New Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   On the right, some politicians say Canada's sovereignty will be
compromised if it does not seek a formal alliance with the new Northern
Command--because, they say, Canada in effect has no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a decision made by the United States which is in
fact going to influence and cover Canadian territory," said Stockwell
Day, the opposition Alliance's shadow minister for foreign affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The new Yukon-to-Yucatan continental command is expected to be based
in underground bunkers in Colorado, alongside the subterranean
headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. But unlike
NORAD, where leadership is shared with Canadian air force generals, the
Northern Command would be an exclusively U.S. military structure, along
the lines of the Southern Command, where the Pentagon coordinates U.S.
military activity in Latin America and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   NORAD will remain a "binational command" but within the proposed
U.S.-run Northern Command, Air Force Maj. Mike Halbig, a Pentagon
spokesman, said Friday. But the United States has told the Canadians that
it might consider a similar partnership for land and sea patrols, said a
U.S. diplomat in Ottawa, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Canadians looked ahead Friday to a weekend of mourning and
burials. The bodies of the four servicemen were expected to be flown home
today from Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Canadian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The victims were identified as Sgt. Marc D. Leger of Lancaster,
Ontario; Cpl. Ainsworth Dyer of Montreal; and Pvts. Richard A. Green of
Mill Cove, Nova Scotia, and Nathan Smith of Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the wounded Canadian infantrymen--two of whom suffered
life-threatening injuries--were being treated at a U.S. military hospital
in Germany and were said to be in stable condition Friday.</TE>
<TE>   All six suffered shrapnel wounds, said Scott McLeod, a Canadian
military doctor. Two other soldiers with minor injuries were treated at
the Kandahar base.</TE>
<TE>   The four deaths were the Canadian military's first in a combat zone
since the 1950-53 Korean War, when 516 soldiers were killed. An
additional 111 members of the Canadian armed forces have died in
international peacekeeping operations since then, and 78 Canadian
citizens enlisted in the U.S. military were killed during the Vietnam
War.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't get it," said Wayne Smith, a salesman visiting the
capital from Kitchener, Ontario. "With all that sophisticated equipment
they have, how could something like this happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet Canadian news reports, striving for judiciousness, have pointed to
many other incidents of friendly fire casualties, including the three
U.S. servicemen killed by U.S. bombs in Afghanistan in December. "I guess
this isn't so rare, but we are outraged because it happened to us--and
because it was done by them, the Americans," said Andre Dufour, a
University of Ottawa engineering student.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Eggleton announced the formation of an official Canadian
board of inquiry into the accident, headed by retired Gen. Maurice Baril.
The board will begin work Monday, Eggleton said, and report back to the
government in three weeks. A Canadian brigadier general on the board will
also participate in the U.S. government panel investigating the accident,
Baril said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian reporters demanded to know whether Baril's board would
request testimony from the still-unidentified U.S. Air National Guard
pilot who mistakenly bombed the infantrymen. The retired general
indicated that it would not.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to see a Canadian soldier dragged in front of a board
of inquiry in another country?" Baril asked.</TE>

<DL>ISABELA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>The campaign of kidnapping and terror waged for a decade by Muslim
extremists on Basilan island hasn't ended yet, but residents believe that
they know why the tide seems to be turning in the government's favor.</LD>
<LD>   It's because of the American soldiers who recently arrived, and their
high-tech equipment.</LD>
<LD>   "The Americans are superior," math teacher Mario Orbigoso said as he
slouched at the front gates of a school. "They can see at night."</LD>
<TE>   Off-duty police Sgt. Jalal Masalim agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The rebels don't come now because they're afraid of the Americans and
their technology," he said. "Things are better in the town."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually everyone agrees that the 160 U.S. Special Forces soldiers
here are making a difference--and not just in the effort to crush the Abu
Sayyaf guerrilla group.</TE>
<TE>   In a small anteroom of the modest Santa Isabela Cathedral, Roman
Catholic priest Rodel Angeles said he believes the Americans will help
check the official corruption that he and others believe has helped
prolong the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Those [officials] who are insincere will be more cautious now," the
priest said. "The Americans are monitoring things closely."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that such a small U.S. force--one not even allowed to engage
in combat--can dramatically transform attitudes is a measure of both the
size of American power and the expectations that go along with it. It
also raises questions about the longer-term implications of U.S.
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Although the arrival of the Americans has lifted the spirits of the
mainly Christian population of Isabela, members of Basilan island's
Muslim majority see it differently. Even moderates question American
intentions and suggest that the U.S. presence may be sowing the seeds of
an even more bitter conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people need homes, jobs, health care and an education, not to be
attacked by helicopters," said Jack Jikiri, head of the privately funded
Al Amin Society, which promotes youth education among Muslims. "If you
harass us today, the next generation will only hate you for it. You're
not resolving problems, you're creating new ones."</TE>
<TE>   It is widely accepted here that poverty is one of the main reasons
that young men join extremist groups like the Abu Sayyaf. Rebel leaders
lure young men with promises of a weapon, a share of ransom money and the
vague idea of fighting for an Islamic homeland.</TE>
<TE>   About 600 U.S. soldiers opened America's first Southeast Asian front
in the war against terrorism earlier this year after intelligence reports
linked the leadership of the Abu Sayyaf to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network. Many of those 600 are supporting operations on Basilan from
locations elsewhere in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 additional American soldiers--mainly construction
engineers--reportedly arrived Friday on Basilan to improve roads and port
facilities and build helipads. U.S. military officials said the work will
serve a dual purpose, making operations against the Abu Sayyaf easier
while also aiding economic development.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere on the island, Abu Sayyaf rebels hold three
hostages--Philippine nurse Deborah Yap and an American missionary couple,
Gracia and Martin Burnham. All have been held for nearly 11 months
despite efforts by a 3,500-strong Philippine military force to free them.</TE>
<TE>   It's not U.S. firepower that is altering the military balance.
Night-vision goggles, modern communications equipment, electronic
surveillance aircraft and the ability to mount night helicopter rescue
operations have intimidated the rebels, boosted Philippine army morale
and left ordinary citizens in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw two Chinooks fly over, I thought, 'Wow,' " recalled
government worker Geraldine Valbuena of her first glance at the giant
American troop-carrying helicopter. "Then I saw my first C-17. I couldn't
believe it."</TE>
<TE>   The C-17, one of the largest cargo aircraft in the U.S. military, is
big enough to dwarf the Philippine armed forces' C-130 transports.</TE>
<TE>   P-3 Orion aircraft, carrying surveillance equipment capable of
detecting movement beneath the thick jungle canopy, and Black Hawk
helicopters able to pluck wounded soldiers out of the battlefield at
night also have combined to tilt the scales.</TE>
<TE>   No longer able to move at night with impunity, guerrillas have been
harassed by Philippine forces with increased frequency in recent weeks.
They have also suffered greater casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do the fighting, but the Americans are there with all this
equipment," said Brig. Gen. Edilberto Adan, chief spokesman for the Armed
Forces of the Philippines. "It's a multiplier we've never had--Chinooks,
electronic sensors--these are things we've only dreamed of, but now they
are there. The pressure from the Americans is demoralizing the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   All this has given residents a feeling that the fighting might be
ending. Muslims are trickling back to remote villages that they had
abandoned because they were afraid of being either trapped by the
fighting or suspected by government forces of abetting the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Valbuena, who works at the Department of Social Welfare and
Development field office in Zamboanga, on Mindanao island, said that more
than 100 families returned to an area about 20 miles west of Isabela
between January and March.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces Lt. Col. David Maxwell recalled visiting a nearly
empty community near the western town of Maluso shortly after his arrival
on Basilan in mid-February. When he visited again a month later, he found
the local school full of children.</TE>
<TE>   "People are moving back into the villages," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Christian churches that had closed because of the terrorist campaign
also have begun to reopen, and Isabela's residents are no longer afraid
to venture from home after dark.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder that a banner stretched across Isabela's modest main
drag hails the new Philippine- American cooperation agreement, called
Balikatan, or "shoulder-to-shoulder" in English.</TE>
<TE>   The banner fluttered in the late-morning breeze recently just a few
feet from the steps of Santa Isabela Cathedral, where Abu Sayyaf
guerrillas dumped the headless bodies of two hostages two years ago. The
group also kidnapped a priest from the cathedral about the same time and
later tortured and killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, including Father Angeles, believe that the U.S. presence
might also prevent a repeat of other troubling events, such as a
controversial incident last June.</TE>
<TE>   After apparently surrounding guerrillas and their hostages at a
hospital in the town of Lamitan, Philippine military and police units
suddenly withdrew. The rebels slipped away. The incident has been the
subject of a parliamentary inquiry amid accusations that local officials
and senior military leaders were paid to let the rebels escape. So far,
nothing has been proved.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States weighs the prospects of sending additional forces
to the region, Father Angeles framed the worry of many of those who have
seen life begin to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, people are starting to return to their homes, but this is going
to take a long time," he said. "Most people are worried the Americans
will leave without the job done."</TE>

<HD>The Inside Dope on '420' Buzz</HD>
<DH>* When, where and why did innocuous numbers become a sly reference
to 'pot smoker'? Its history is hazy but the smoke may finally be
clearing on the real story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Today is Saturday, April 20. Dude! Do you have any idea what that
means?</LD>
<LD>   Brad Olsen does. For three years the 36-year-old entrepreneur has been
trying to get today's date into alignment with his annual How Weird
Street Faire, a celebration of, among other things, peace, music, tech,
the counterculture and space aliens. This year--just as the energy drink
Red Bull pulled out as festival sponsor, leaving him short of promotional
funding--Olsen finally scored the calendrical convergence that means so
much to so many in his target demographic.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, that date, that number, four-twenty, just resonates with--"
he suddenly paused, considering whether to just blurt it out: dope
smokers. Finally he laughed, "That date's just embedded now in stoner
lingo. Which was why I wanted it."</LD>
<TE>   In a phenomenon that has turned a snippet of street slang into an
almost mainstream sales gimmick, the number 420--and its temporal
counterparts, 4:20 and 4/20--have quietly risen from the lexicon of
marijuana users to become countercultural marketing tools. Never mind
that pot remains a controlled substance, that court battles rage over the
legality of medical marijuana, that the Bush administration has linked
drug use to the support of international terrorist networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Four-twenty"--once an obscure Bay Area term for pot--is showing up
nationally in the advertisements and business names of concert promoters,
travel agencies, even high-tech companies.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's Sweetwater Brewing Co., launched six years ago by a group of
entrepreneurs in their 20s, sells its 420 Pale Ale in supermarkets and
opens its doors to the public at 4:20 p.m Mondays through Thursdays. New
York's 420 Tours sells low-cost travel packages to the Netherlands and
Jamaica. Highway 420 Radio broadcasts "music for the chemically enhanced"
online.</TE>
<TE>   The founders of Sacramento-based 420net.com, meanwhile, chose their
name not because their start-up, which specializes in Web servers, has a
party angle, but because their target customers are online game
players--a group that tends to be male, single, young and hip to
adolescent underground lingo. Kris Greenough, a 23-year-old co-founder,
conceded that if the reference was intentionally misleading, it was also
"catchy, shall we say."</TE>
<TE>   The hook extends, as well, to the event business. Scores of
countercultural-themed gatherings are scheduled nationally for today,
from a Washington, D.C., rally against the war on terrorism to the
national convention of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws in San Francisco's Union Square. The Bay Area alone has
slated at least half a dozen events, including the Cannabis Action
Network's 6th Annual 420 Hemp Fest, an ad hoc smoke-in on Mt. Tamalpais
in Marin County and a "420" night at a Mission District bar, featuring
glass pipe vendors and a nurse who home-delivers organic pot brownies.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Police Inspector Sherman Ackerson says the department
won't be cracking down, due to the city's "laissez-faire" stance on pot
possession. Drug abuse prevention groups, not surprisingly, are less
nonchalant about it. Last year, the forReal.org Web site of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention put out a public service document titled, "It's 4:20--Do You
Know Where Your Teen Is?"</TE>
<TE>   "The 420 icon is very well recognized in the subculture of marijuana
users, and now it is being used very skillfully to brand," said Alvera
Stern, who heads the center's federal division of prevention, application
and education. The mainstreaming of terms like "420," she said, gives the
false impression that pot smoking is socially acceptable and widespread.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives credence to a marijuana user's perception that everyone is
doing it, in spite of data from four major national surveys showing the
majority of people have never used marijuana in their lives," Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   But, at least in some cases, the "420" hook is less about getting high
than about getting attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want my thing to be a big smoke-out," said Olsen, who has
hired private security guards to make sure his expected crowd of 3,000
revelers doesn't do anything too blatantly illegal. "But it's a memorable
date: 'The How Weird Street Faire. 420.' Boom. That makes an impression.
And I need an impression, because this thing costs $3,000 to $5,000 on
the front end and I don't have much of a marketing budget this year."</TE>
<TE>   How a random three-digit number became a pot euphemism is, in itself,
a story. Either that, or something from the annals of Cheech &amp; Chong.</TE>
<TE>   Links between youth culture and the number surfaced after the April
20, 1999, Columbine massacre, when some postulated that the shooters
chose the date of their rampage to coincide either with Hitler's birthday
or some date of unspecified importance to teenage youth culture. Well
before that, however, pager-toting suburban adolescents throughout the
country used the three digits as a code for smoking marijuana. And in
1991, High Times magazine, a staunch promoter of the 420 phenomenon,
published an item on a flier that a staffer found circulating at a
Grateful Dead concert in Oakland: "WAKE 'N' BAKE. Smoke Pot At 4:20," the
flier reportedly said.</TE>
<TE>   The term, however, appears to have been coined long before then,
according to those who have tracked it. Stern, for example, says she
heard it as long ago as the late 1980s, when she was working with young
people in a Pennsylvania drug treatment facility. Ron Angier, field
supervisor for the Marin District of California State Parks, has
recollections that are older still, from his first days as a park ranger
22 years ago on Mt. Tamalpais.</TE>
<TE>   "Crowds of teenagers just started showing up on the mountain at 4:20
p.m. on April 20," Angier said. "Maybe a thousand kids went up one year
to Bolinas Ridge, this open vista that overlooks the Pacific Ocean and
Stinson Beach."</TE>
<TE>   At first, he said, the authorities viewed it as a harmless
spring-fever ditch day or, later, a perhaps-overly-enthusiastic Earth Day
observation. But soon the annual al fresco smoke-in clogged the two-lane
mountain roads with parked cars. "Occasionally we'd have injuries, either
from accidents or overdoses," said Angier. "We started having to close
down the mountain because it was becoming unsafe."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the mid-1990s, the pilgrimage dissipated, to the point
that Angier, who now supervises the Mt. Tamalpais ranger station, plans
no increase in park enforcement this year. The reason?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think this generation has more to do than to just run up to
Mt. Tam and get loaded," Angier said. "Also 420 is a nationwide thing
now. The events are all over, not just here."</TE>
<TE>   That still doesn't explain what the number 420 has to do with
marijuana. One theory holds that there are exactly 420 chemical
components in marijuana. (Untrue, say the experts). Another is that when
the Grateful Dead toured, they always stayed in Room 420. (Also untrue,
says Grateful Dead Productions spokesman Dennis McNally.)</TE>
<TE>   "My kids' little skateboard friends in Oregon used to tell me that 420
was police code for a pot bust," laughed Carolyn "Mountain Girl" Adams, a
former wife of the Dead's late guitarist Jerry Garcia, repeating yet
another popular, but inaccurate, theory.</TE>
<TE>   "But I never heard the term before the 1990s," she said, speaking by
cell phone from a park bench in Colorado, where she had gone to catch the
tour of String Cheese Incident, a Dead-inspired jam band.</TE>
<TE>   "We always just said, you know, 'joints' or 'doobies,' or 'Js' or
whatever. 'Four-twenty' was a '90s thing that traveled the way hula hoops
and Frisbees traveled, along the youth net. Via the hackey-sack crowd."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only documented story behind the 420 phenomenon is the
most comically mundane one, starring a group of now-middle-aged former
slackers at San Rafael High School in 1971. One--now a commercial lender
in San Francisco--told the story on condition that he be referred to only
by his first name, Steve.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of clients in L.A., I'm 47 years old, I don't smoke
anymore and I run an $80-million-a-year business," the wiry father of one
said, sitting in a small, cubicle-filled office on the 12th floor of a
Financial District high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   His desk was filled with snapshots of his 6-year-old daughter, his
suit was pinstriped and his filing cabinet sported a plaque from the
Better Business Bureau. The only evidence of his assertion that "I'm
still an old hippie" was the pair of sneakers he wore around the office
instead of the dress shoes he kept under his desk, for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Few of his old friends, he said, still smoke pot with much frequency.
(One, now a Marin County father of two who is a sales representative for
a Burbank-based notions company, said in a later phone interview that the
last time he got the urge, he had to hide in the garage so his wife and
kids wouldn't see him.)</TE>
<TE>   The men said they didn't mind telling their story for posterity, but
at this point in their lives, they have too much at stake to speak for
attribution. "As my wife says, 'Where's the upside?' " laughed Steve.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Steve said, in 1971, a friend approached them one day at
school with a map of Marin County. "He said his brother-in-law was in the
Coast Guard and had planted a patch of weed out on the Point Reyes
Peninsula, but believed his C.O. was onto him, and he didn't want to get
busted. So he had offered it to our friend, who was offering it to us."</TE>
<TE>   The group agreed to meet that afternoon after school at 4:20 p.m. by a
campus statue of Louis Pasteur, he said, and head out to search for the
marijuana patch. "But one thing led to another," he laughed, "and suffice
it to say we never found it. Every day we'd meet at 4:20 by this statue,
and every day we'd just end up getting high and driving around for
hours." Over time, the mere phrase "four-twenty"--exchanged in a hallway,
or discreetly mentioned in the presence of teachers and parents--became
their personal code for "time to get high," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve and his friends went off to college--mostly at San Diego State
and Cal State San Luis Obispo--but their secret code lived on in Marin
County, preserved by younger brothers and friends. "We have postmarked
letters we wrote to each other from the early '70s with all kinds of
references to '420,' " Steve said. Gradually, he said, the term was
picked up by local teenagers, and then by Deadheads, who are legion in
Marin County.</TE>
<TE>   "By the mid-1990s," he said, "we started seeing it all over. We
couldn't believe it--it was on hats, T-shirts, record labels, cleaning
solutions, all over the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued, he said, he logged onto a High Times magazine Web site,
found the reference to the Grateful Dead flier, and contacted Steven
Hager, the magazine's editor-in-chief. Though he did at one point do some
research to find out whether the term was trademarked (it is, by various
entities for various products), "We weren't looking for money," he said.
"We never got a penny, and that wasn't my goal--I already have a
successful business. But I e-mailed him anyway and said, 'This is the
story. It's not police code, it has nothing to do with Hitler's birthday
or chemical compounds, and I have the postmarked letters to prove it. It
was just a joke. Just a joke! And now stoners have turned it into some
kind of holiday."</TE>
<TE>   High Times eventually did an article in late 1998 on the friends, who
stay in touch and still refer to themselves by their old high school gang
name, "the Waldos." But by then, the term had taken on a life--and a
lore--of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws took up the 420 banner--announcing that April 20 was "Stoner's New
Year," that its national conference would, from then on, be held on 4/20
and that 4:20 p.m. was to pot smokers "what Miller Time has become to
beer drinkers--some legalization advocates predicted the exposure would
instantly kill the 420 phenomenon with uncoolness. Instead, according to
those who have capitalized on it, it has merely followed the natural
evolution of all that is trendy in a capitalist market.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty million Americans have smoked marijuana at some point in their
lives, according to government figures. That's one out of three people,"
noted NORML executive director Keith Stroup, pointing to the same studies
the government's Stern used to note that two out of three people haven't
used it.</TE>
<TE>   "This idea of 420 being a 'secret code' is kind of funny, when you
think that a third of the population is in on the secret. We're going to
be selling tickets to our 420 party at $50 a pop--that's how mainstream
we think it is."</TE>

<HD>The Man Who Stands Ready to Be Hungary's King</HD>
<DH>Europe: Archduke Gyorgy, however, notes the many ifs blocking the
monarchy's return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary
</DL>
<LD>Gyorgy von Hapsburg knows that the chances he will ever be king of
Hungary are exceedingly small. Yet it is hard to shake the impression
that he lives with an eye to the possibility that maybe, just maybe, that
could happen.</LD>
<LD>   Discussing the odds for the restoration of the monarchy in a land his
grandfather once ruled, Archduke Gyorgy, to use his royal title, verbally
dances around the question like the diplomat he is.</LD>
<LD>   "Who knows?" he says, noting that history shows it's wrong to say
"never."</LD>
<TE>   If called upon to serve as king or prime minister, "I wouldn't say
no," he adds. "My family still has historical responsibility. But there
are so many 'if if if if ifs.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gyorgy, 37, moved to Budapest from Germany nine years ago, learned to
give speeches and interviews in Hungarian, married a German duchess with
her own family ties to European royalty and recently built a home
complete with stables just outside this centuries-old capital. He wears
three hats: local television executive; Hungarian ambassador to the
European Parliament; and representative in Hungary for his father, Otto
von Hapsburg, 89, who would be emperor of Austria and king of Hungary if
those jobs still existed.</TE>
<TE>   King Ferdinand I, whose reign began in 1526, was the first Hapsburg to
rule Hungary. The last monarch in the dynasty was Otto's father, Emperor
Charles I of Austria, who was also King Charles IV of Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in southern Germany, Gyorgy first visited Hungary for
the 1989 funeral of his grandmother Zita, the last empress and queen. In
the next few years, he traveled here frequently with his father, who is
fluent in Hungarian, a notoriously difficult language.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone expects automatically that I also speak Hungarian," Gyorgy
says. "And I didn't. I felt very bad about it. Then I tried to learn it
in Germany. It didn't work. So in the beginning of 1993, I came here to
learn Hungarian. Then it was practically like an avalanche of things
happening to me. I will stay here, and I most probably am going to die
here."</TE>
<TE>   Gyorgy's older brother, Karl, would be first in line after Otto for
the thrones of the Austro-Hungarian "dual monarchy," which collapsed in
1918. But Gyorgy, next in line, is the only one of seven siblings who has
forged a strong Hungarian connection. With a gesture toward his wife,
Archduchess Eilika, 29, seated beside him, he says: "Besides, of course,
getting married, the best decision I took in my life was to come to
Hungary."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in her late teens, the former Eilika von Oldenburg sometimes
attended the same balls or other European social events he did, Gyorgy
says. At some, they spoke. There were others where they only later
learned they had both been guests. Then, in 1995, they met again "at a
weekend that was organized by an aunt of mine in the Alps," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "We had long and very serious discussions," he says, as Eilika starts
laughing. "It was a very harsh discussion between Lutheran and Catholic
basic ideas. The whole weekend we were arguing a lot, making a lot of
walks, and we were always discussing things."</TE>
<TE>   But somehow, instead of pushing them apart, those debates brought them
together. Eilika came to Budapest with a group of friends. He saw her in
Paris. Soon they were trading visits, and their telephone bills went up,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   The couple married in a high-profile 1997 ceremony in Budapest, with a
guest list that had nobility rubbing shoulders with former senior
Communists.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for a capsule summary of Hapsburg history, Gyorgy says the
family "started its career" in 10th century Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "We had in our family the [Holy Roman] Emperor Charles [V]," he says.
"It was said that in his kingdom, the sun never set, because he was also
king of Spain, and Spain was in South America. . . . But let's say--sorry
for my bad English--our 'core business' was Central Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Archduchess Sophia, the couple's first child, became the
first Hapsburg to be born in Hungary in more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Sophia is being raised as a Roman Catholic, in the traditional faith
of the Hapsburgs. But Eilika says she feels no need to convert.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than have a wife who claims to be Catholic but "doesn't feel
it," Gyorgy says, "I prefer much more having someone who is a convinced
Lutheran and feels very well in this Lutheran religion."</TE>
<TE>   Eilika's work focuses on horseback riding as physical therapy for
disabled children. She runs programs at their home and is on the board of
the Hungarian Riding for the Disabled Federation.</TE>
<TE>   While growing up in Bavaria, Gyorgy spoke German at home, learned
English and French at school, picked up Spanish during frequent vacations
at a family home in Spain and added Italian on visits to cousins in
Italy, he says. In his university years, he studied law in Innsbruck,
Austria, then history and political science in Munich, Germany, and
finally Islamic studies for a year in Madrid. During school vacations, he
worked in television.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Budapest, he started working for MTM-SBS Television,
Hungary's first nationwide private TV network. He is now international
relations director for the firm's TV2 and holds both Hungarian and
Austrian citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn named Gyorgy ambassador
at large for European integration. The appointment marked the first time
that a Hapsburg had held public office in Hungary since 1918. When a
center-right government came to power two years later, Prime Minister
Viktor Orban renewed the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his job involves serving as the country's liaison to the
European Parliament, Gyorgy says. Hungary is not yet a member of the
parliament, but it hopes to join the European Union in 2004. Family ties
are a major asset for his diplomatic duties, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, whatever Gyorgy's strengths as a diplomat, Hungarians are in no
mood to bring back even a constitutional monarchy, says Tamas Fricz,
director of the Budapest-based 21st Century Institute for Political
Science. Longtime Communist dictator Janos Kadar was "the last 'king' in
Hungary" and now people are "fed up with the notion of one leader above
them," Fricz said.</TE>
<TE>   So Gyorgy is not a candidate for king but rather "a decoration," Fricz
said. "He helps Hungary, and he represents Hungarian interests--but
nothing more."</TE>

<HD>Pilot Is Focus of Milan Crash Probe</HD>
<DH>Italy: Friends attest to Luigi Fasulo's skills. But a son thinks he
hit a skyscraper on purpose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LOCARNO, Switzerland
</DL>
<LD>The pilot who crashed into an Italian skyscraper Thursday had been
making a detour from Switzerland to Italy to save fuel taxes, friends and
fellow pilots said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Three people were killed, including pilot Luigi "Gino" Fasulo, and
several dozen hurt when Fasulo's four-seater red-and-white tourist
aircraft slammed into the upper floors of the 30-story Pirelli building
in Milan.</LD>
<LD>   Fasulo, 67, had taken off from this southern Swiss town, about 30
minutes away by plane, and had planned to return almost immediately to
Lugano, another town in Italian-speaking southern Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   Pilots said they regularly make such short jaunts to Italy after
filling up their tanks in Switzerland. By flying across the border, they
can claim to have exported the fuel and reclaim the fuel taxes from Swiss
customs authorities when they return.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Fasulo was in good health and emotionally stable. They
firmly ruled out any suggestion that the father of two sons--both pilots
themselves--might have wanted to take his own life.</TE>
<TE>   But Fasulo's son Marco, a pilot for the airline Swiss, told the Rome
newspaper La Repubblica that his father's crash was a suicide induced by
despair over financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's ANSA news agency said that Thursday morning, Fasulo made a
telephone call to police in the Italian town of Como, close to the border
with Switzerland, saying he had lost substantial sums in secretive,
cross-border financial transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a suicide, a suicide, do you understand?" La Repubblica quoted
Marco Fasulo as saying. "They wanted to cheat him, knock him down
economically, and he killed himself."</TE>
<TE>   Milan Chief Prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio, however, said suicide was
the least credible of three possible explanations police were examining,
including a technical problem and pilot illness.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Transportation Minister Pietro Lunardi said in a Friday
briefing in the Senate that the pilot could have fallen ill at the
controls. After Fasulo made initial radio contact with flight
controllers, "there was silence, he was not operating any of the plane's
controls in the last two minutes," D'Ambrosio said.</TE>
<TE>   Lunardi said he had ordered a probe into the pilot's health, personal
life and finances.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before the crash, Fasulo had started his landing approach to
Milan's Linate Airport but was not lined up correctly, said a spokesman
for Italy's civil aviation authority, ENAV.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch out, you're heading toward a cross runway, line yourself up,"
the air traffic controller told the pilot shortly before 5:42 p.m.,
according to a transcript of radio communications between the plane and
Linate.</TE>
<TE>   Fasulo said, "I've got a small problem with the landing gear."</TE>
<TE>   "Roger, circle ATA," the flight controller said, referring to the
private airstrip at the western edge of Linate just east of the city.</TE>
<TE>   According to ENAV, a helicopter flying in the area then asked
permission to land.</TE>
<TE>   "Request authority to begin landing procedure," the helicopter pilot
said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, go away, go away," the flight controller said.</TE>
<TE>   Fasulo then spoke, apparently believing that the order to fly away
from Linate was for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Understood. I'll execute [the order]," ENAV quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, it's not for you. It's for me," the helicopter pilot said.</TE>
<TE>   The air traffic controller advised Fasulo of his mistake and told him
that he was heading toward the heart of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I'm fixing a problem with the landing gear," the pilot said in
his last recorded words.</TE>
<TE>   At the Magadino airport near Locarno, director Sandro Balestra, like
others, described Fasulo as an excellent pilot with more than 5,000 hours
of flight time in more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Balestra confirmed stories of mishaps. Fasulo, who at one time ran
an air taxi service flying VIPs around Europe, once ran out of fuel as he
approached the airport in Zurich, Switzerland, missing the runway by more
than a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, under similar circumstances, he landed in a field.</TE>
<TE>   After the Zurich incident, which occurred more than a decade ago,
Fasulo temporarily lost his pilot's license, Balestra said. Fasulo gave
up the taxi business and no longer had the necessary license to fly with
instruments, and on Thursday was flying just by sight.</TE>
<TE>   The mishaps earned Fasulo the nicknames "Cowboy of the Air" and "Out
of Oil." But friends said that, as he aged, Fasulo had become more
cautious.</TE>

<HD>S. Korea Picks Boeing as the Accusations Fly</HD>
<DH>Asia: Critics allege underhandedness in the contract award for
fighter jets. French firm is seeking an injunction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>The South Korean Defense Ministry announced Friday that it will
award a $4.4-billion contract for fighter jets to Boeing Co., capping a
tumultuous bidding war that has triggered almost daily anti-American
protests here and allegations of skulduggery.</LD>
<LD>   The contract for 40 Boeing F-15s was immediately challenged by rival
Dassault Aviation of France, which is seeking a court injunction to block
the deal and make public the details of the bidding process.</LD>
<LD>   Dassault alleges that the South Korean government took into account
purely political considerations in picking the American-made jet, while
other critics charge that Seoul came under unfair pressure from the
United States, its main ally.</LD>
<TE>   The unusually public competition has been tantamount to a
Franco-American war, with charges and countercharges splayed daily across
the front pages of newspapers here. Two South Korean military procurement
officials have been indicted for allegedly taking bribes from the French
company--one claims he is being persecuted because he is a
whistle-blower--and university students have been crashing the Web site
of the Defense Ministry with protests against the F-15.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the choice was being announced at the Defense Ministry,
demonstrators protested outside with banners reading, "We cannot buy
peace with arms!"</TE>
<TE>   "People are very emotional," Deputy Defense Minister Cha Young Koo
said. "We made our decision with cool heads, with the national interest
as the top priority."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which stations 37,000 troops in South Korea as a bulwark
against communist North Korea, has had a virtual monopoly in the sale of
fighter jets here since the 1950-53 Korean War. Two years ago, when they
started shopping for a new fleet of fighters, the Koreans decided to put
the contract out to bid with a new and more open procurement process.</TE>
<TE>   Seven companies submitted bids, and the contest was whittled down
through various rounds of evaluations to Dassault, which makes the Rafale
fighter, and Boeing, which is to manufacture an updated version, known as
the F-15K, of its classic jet. That's when the bidding war began to get
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   During President Bush's visit to Asia in February, a popular
conspiracy theory took root here that the ulterior motive of the trip was
to sell weapons and that the White House would support South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung's policies of greater openness toward North Korea
only if Boeing won the bid.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a conspiracy seemed to gain credence in March when a South
Korean air force colonel involved in the bidding appeared on
television--his voice and image altered to disguise his identity--to
allege that superiors had told him the U.S. threatened to pull its troops
out of the Korean peninsula if Boeing did not win the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Then came yet another twist. The colonel, since identified as Cho Joo
Hyung, was arrested a week later on charges that he took $8,400 in bribes
from Dassault's South Korean agent. Another air force colonel was
arrested as well, while the Seoul offices of Dassault's public relations
firm and its partner were raided by police.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, the Defense Ministry announced that the F-15 was
emerging as the likely winner going into final evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by telephone from Paris on Friday, Dassault's vice president
for international relations, Yves Robins, denied there had been any
bribery involved and suggested that the arrests were a reaction to the
colonel's appearance as a whistle-blower on television.</TE>
<TE>   The main criticism of the F-15 is that it is an older-model plane than
the Rafale and, although being upgraded by Boeing, is expected to go out
of production sooner, making it more difficult for South Korea to
purchase parts.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like buying a Ford Model-T. You can put a CD player in it. You
can put in a navigation system and air bags, but it is still a Model-T,"
Robins said. "This is an aircraft with a very honorable history, but it
is 30 years old. It is a product of the Cold War."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Boeing, countered that the
F-15 has been continually upgraded and perfected through the years.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more than 1,500 flying around the world. . . . The Rafale
is an unproven technology," Park said. He added that the
"interoperability" of the F-15 with other U.S.-made weaponry in the South
Korean military is a legitimate reason to favor an American bidder.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official said it was natural for the U.S. government to
support the efforts of American companies to sell products abroad and
that all countries do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "What seems natural to other countries can look like bullying when it
is the United States," said the official, who requested anonymity.
"That's part of the problem being the biggest kid on the block."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and South Korean officials say Bush did not bring up the F-15 bid
during his visit. But Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in January accompanied House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) on a trip to Seoul, where they
discussed the F-15 with Kim.</TE>
<TE>   The new fighters are to be manufactured during the next six years at
Boeing's St. Louis-based Military Aircraft and Missile Systems division.
Boeing has been hit hard by the slump in commercial aviation since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and by the loss last year of a $200-billion
Pentagon contract to Lockheed Martin Corp. to develop a new fighter.</TE>

country as a loose union of two states.</LD>
<LD>   Filip Vujanovic announced his resignation in a letter to parliament,
blaming unsuccessful attempts to preserve a coalition government split

<LD>   Last month, the two remaining Yugoslav republics agreed to the deal
that will restructure the federation into a loose alliance with a new

<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday night for a
fact-finding mission on the devastation in the Palestinian refugee camp
in Jenin, which was raided by Israeli troops and tanks during the last
three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Bowing to international pressure, the United States drafted the
resolution after Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said his country
would support a team chosen by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, in search of Palestinian suicide bombers, has denied that
hundreds of people were killed in Jenin, and Annan told council members
Peres had mentioned 48 Palestinian deaths, diplomats reported.</LD>
<TE>   The team will gather information on recent events in Jenin, the scene
of some of the heaviest fighting since Israel's offensive into the West
Bank began about three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The document expresses concern at the "dire humanitarian situation" of
Palestinian civilians, in particular a report from Jenin "of an unknown
number of deaths and destruction."</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to have the facts with regard to what has happened in
Jenin," U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte said.</TE>

<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops finished their withdrawal from this West Bank town
Friday, but encircled it with tanks, snipers and roadblocks as
Palestinian residents continued digging through the rubble of an adjacent
refugee camp for corpses.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army said it had completed its operations in the town and
the camp, scenes of the bloodiest fighting in Israel's massive,
three-week military sweep through Palestinian areas. No Israeli army
forces could be seen in the streets Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But troops were positioned to reenter at will, with tanks and armored
personnel carriers parked only a few yards from the town limits. Soldiers
took up positions in olive groves and fields and on dirt tracks.</LD>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has promised President Bush that Israeli
forces will withdraw from Palestinian areas of the West Bank, except for
the cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem, over the coming week. Israeli media
reported Friday night that troops will pull out of the city of Nablus and
parts of Ramallah by Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also has vowed that Israeli forces will reenter Palestinian
territory as deemed necessary to root out militants.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the refugee camp here, there were scenes of misery as the slow
work of uncovering bodies continued. Refugees disinterred more than two
dozen bodies from the rubble of the camp to bury them anew in a cemetery
dedicated to those killed in the incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians continued to insist that between 300 and 400 people were
killed, though only 39 bodies had been found by Friday. Israeli forces
lost 23 soldiers and have estimated Palestinian losses at about 60.</TE>
<TE>   Women sobbed as they attempted to identify loved ones. The stench of
death permeated the area. The bodies, wrapped in white cloth, were taken
to an olive grove at the edge of the camp to be laid to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not defeated. Our will is strong and is not broken. Resistance
is still our option," said Taysir Fayed, 42, who believes that he lost
two brothers, both members of the militant group Hamas, during the
invasion. One man was missing; the body of the other was disinterred and
reburied Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Making a bad situation worse, several refugees were injured when they
detonated, apparently by accident, explosive devices remaining from the
battle. Local doctors said at least five people, four of them children,
were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   At Jenin's hospital, Alaa Rateb was recovering after being injured in
an explosion late Thursday afternoon. Relatives said the boy was 15 or
16. His eyes were swollen shut and his face blistered and blackened with
specks of shrapnel. His right hand was wrapped in bloody gauze. He lost
two fingers in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Rateb said he was injured as he tried to deliver clothes to his aunt.
He went to her home, knocked and pushed the door open. Suddenly, he was
flung backward.</TE>
<TE>   "I knocked on the door and something exploded," he said. "I don't know
what it was."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush responded to questions about conditions
in the camps by saying: "I share a deep concern about the humanitarian
plight of people who live in that region. Obviously, I worry about
families whose lives have been affected by the terror."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, earlier said the administration
supported an international investigation of the Jenin occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, meanwhile, conferred in Washington
with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on the next steps in the
diplomatic quest for peace. Powell said the United States is anxious to
see a full Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian areas so that talks can
resume on security and political issues.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, where tensions are mounting as Palestinians brace
for what many believe will be Israel's next military campaign, a
Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up Friday at an Israeli
checkpoint near the Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements. Islamic Jihad,
a militant group, claimed responsibility. One soldier was slightly
injured in the blast, which occurred on the main Gaza road.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, three Palestinians were shot and killed by Israeli troops
in Rafah, a hot spot of violence on Gaza's border with Egypt. The army
said troops entered the Brazil refugee camp looking for entrances to
cross-border underground tunnels, which Israel says are used to smuggle
arms. Palestinians said a gunfight broke out when troops and more than a
dozen tanks moved into the crowded camp, scene of many previous gun
battles and army incursions.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said the troops bulldozed several homes, but an army
spokesman denied that.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, two Islamic Jihad militants trying to infiltrate
the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza were killed by Israeli troops,
Palestinians and the army reported. A 19-year-old and a 20-year-old were
spotted moving toward the settlement, an army spokesman said. Both were
carrying rifles and one had a ladder, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad issued a statement saying the men had been sent to
avenge "massacres by the enemy" in Jenin and other West Bank towns.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Palestinians marched in grim funeral processions in Gaza
on Friday afternoon, burying six police officers killed in Nablus earlier
this month when Israeli troops entered the city's ancient marketplace.
Such funerals are beginning to take place across the West Bank as bodies
from the recent fighting are being returned to their home villages.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani court replaced the judge in the case of slain U.S.
reporter Daniel Pearl on Friday, just days before the four defendants
were to enter pleas, attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer for the chief defendant, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, had asked
that Judge Arshad Noor Khan be removed because he was present during a
Feb. 14 hearing at which the British-born Islamic militant admitted his
role in the kidnapping. Sheikh later recanted, and his lawyers argued
that allowing Khan to preside would be prejudicial to the defense.</LD>
<LD>   The High Court of Sindh province appointed a new judge, Abdul Ghafoor
Memon.</LD>
<TE>   Chief prosecutor Raja Qureshi did not challenge the defense request
and said he did not expect the change to delay the proceedings. Sheikh
and his three co-defendants are expected to enter pleas Monday, Qureshi
said. Seven defendants remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape confirmed Pearl's death, after his Jan. 23 disappearance
in Karachi, Pakistan.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration expanded its financial dragnet against
Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network Friday, ordering U.S.
banks to freeze assets of a Pakistan-based group and nine individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department's action was the government's latest effort to
separate terrorists from their money, a key part of President Bush's war
on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Today we block the finances of an assortment of terrorists involved
in financing and carrying out bombings, kidnappings and murder," said
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill.</LD>
<TE>   When Bush launched his financial war on terrorism, one of the first
groups the U.S. government went after was Al Rashid Trust, which the
United States says actively bankrolled terrorists. Officials said the
group changed its name to the Aid Organization of the Ulema, based in
Pakistan, which was listed on Friday's blocking order.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The former king pulled up in a limousine and climbed regally up the
steps to his father's grave Friday. But as he stepped into the domed
crypt, he shuffled to a stop.</LD>
<LD>   The old man gaped at the rocket holes in the roof, the columns
destroyed by gunfire, the graffiti left by the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 87-year-old former monarch's first up-close experience with
the devastation that his people suffered during his 29 years of exile.</LD>
<TE>   Mohammad Zaher Shah returned to Afghanistan on Thursday, an emotional
homecoming that most Afghans hope will help bring them peace.</TE>
<TE>   Driving through Kabul on Friday, he saw a city vastly different from
the one he left in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   He drove past children sitting atop the stumps of brick houses left in
ruins by bombing. He passed shipping containers riddled with bullet
holes, and the carcasses of blown-apart cars.</TE>
<TE>   Policemen and soldiers saluted his heavily guarded motorcade.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcade climbed the hill topped by the tomb of his father, who
was assassinated before Zaher Shah's eyes in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   The elegant structure was clearly a grand sight in its day, but in the
early 1990s, it served as a fighting position during a factional battle
for Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a brown leather jacket and tinted glasses, Zaher Shah held out
his hands in prayer over his father's tomb while a man recited verses
from the Koran, the Muslim holy book.</TE>
<TE>   The former king turned to Ahmed, the 7-year-old son of Kandahar Gov.
Gul Agha Shirzai, took the boy's face in his hands and kissed the top of
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Then he left, accompanied by interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>

<DH>Afghanistan: The city's instability underscores how much power
still rests with armed militias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Zafar lived just long enough after he was dragged from his house
and stoned to tell his family the name of one of his killers.</LD>
<LD>   No one knows how he got back to his home on the western outskirts of
Kabul late last month. At midnight, he banged on the gate and was found
lying in the road, screaming with pain.</LD>
<LD>   His father, mother and wife never dreamed of going to the police, who
now patrol the capital, for help that night. They didn't trust them.</LD>
<TE>   And although the family later told police the killer's name, no one
has been arrested. The family was so terrified of reprisals by the
killers that they moved from their village of Khojajam.</TE>
<TE>   Crime poses one of the biggest threats to peace and stability in the
city, underscoring just how much power resides with commanders of armed
militias.</TE>
<TE>   As Afghanistan struggles for stability, Prime Minister Hamid Karzai's
interim government is in charge of Kabul but has little control in many
provincial areas. Karzai has repeatedly called for the international
security force, or ISAF, to be extended beyond the capital, despite
opposition from the U.S. and other participants in the peacekeeping
mission.</TE>
<TE>   The German government recently presented a fleet of 48 new cars to
Kabul's fledgling police force, but only a dozen are being used to patrol
the inner city at night. On the outskirts, there are police foot patrols.
The ISAF also patrols in vehicles and on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials insist that there is no need for more patrols. They
say crime is under control.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the western and southern regions, where crime is most common,
locals say the security situation has improved since the era of the
Taliban and earlier. But they are convinced that once the ISAF leaves,
the crime situation will deteriorate sharply. Britain announced recently
that it would extend the term of its peacekeepers from April until at
least June.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the presence of the police and the ISAF in western Kabul, the
area is actually controlled by a powerful local warlord, Abdul Rasul
Sayyaf, who is allied with the Northern Alliance forces that now control
the Interior and Defense ministries and the Kabul police.</TE>
<TE>   Locals suspect that Sayyaf's large, armed and well-paid militia is
behind much of the crime in the area. And no one here believes the
police--unpaid and threadbare--are ready to take it on.</TE>
<TE>   While it is not clear whether Sayyaf's men are behind the shots fired
at peacekeepers in the area, some believe that local police may have cut
their own deals with Sayyaf or his commanders, who are the only real
power in the area. Last week, there was an attack on two ISAF
checkpoints: Of the seven later arrested, five were members of the Kabul
police, and one was from a local militia.</TE>
<TE>   Zafar's mother, Gulchehrah, 45, pulls her dead son's photograph from
the shelf and places it gently on the rug, facing her visitors. Beside
her sits Zafar's wife, Nafisa, 25, cross-legged, nursing her newborn son,
Jamshaid.</TE>
<TE>   The family was so frightened of reprisals that they were reluctant to
speak the name of Azizullah, the man the dying Zafar had blamed. They
added that they believed he was killed by friends in Sayyaf's militia who
had pressed him to join the force a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "His friends were with Sayyaf. I think he was killed by his friends
because of some contention," Gulchehrah says.</TE>
<TE>   It took Zafar's sisters a day of wandering to find where he'd been
taken: a ditch beneath a low stone wall where they saw his hat and shoes.
The place was strewn with large rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked as if the men stood on top of a small wall when they stoned
him," says one sister, Jamilah, 18, her face anguished.</TE>
<TE>   Zafar told his family that the killers had placed a huge rock on his
chest, as well as pelted him with large rocks.</TE>
<TE>   In villages scattered along the western and southern reaches of Kabul,
safety is far from certain.</TE>
<TE>   Saduzai Obdaidee, an engineer in Proshzai Nawabade Charahi Qamber
village, says the new police appeared in the area three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Obdaidee described one robbery 50 yards from the police hut. Officers
didn't respond to calls for help, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many robberies around here. People are very afraid," he
says. "There is shooting at night. If there were not ISAF people, we
could not stay here. No one could stay."</TE>
<TE>   Sayyaf's boys, he says, are young, ill-educated and "very, very
dangerous".</TE>
<TE>   Like Sayyaf's militia, the Kabul police are mainly former Northern
Alliance moujahedeen fighters. They are loyal to another powerful former
moujahedeen commander, Gen. Abdul Basir, who now heads the city police.</TE>
<TE>   With Sayyaf and Basir on the same side, many locals doubt that Basir's
police are willing to take on Sayyaf's soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Sherabuddin, 27, and nine police colleagues share a small mud shed in
Kompanee village in western Kabul, eight of them sleeping like sardines
at night while two go out on foot patrol. For four months they have not
been paid.</TE>
<TE>   "We waited and waited, and the money never came. It's hard to go home
empty-handed," he says, adding that many police are thinking of quitting
but are reluctant to lose back pay. Officers, however, have been paid:
1.5 million afghanis a month, or about $45, according to local exchange
rates.</TE>
<TE>   At night, the streets of central Kabul belong to patrolmen and stray
dogs. Police halt vehicles and demand passwords.</TE>
<TE>   Only those facing a dire medical emergency venture out after curfew,
like Qazee Mohammad, 34, who got a lift in a police van after midnight to
try to buy blood for his wife, who was in the hospital with birth
complications.</TE>
<TE>   Most city crime occurs before the patrols begin, at 10 p.m. or after
they end, at 5 a.m., according to Jabaar, 26, a policeman from Salang,
driving one of the patrol cars one night recently.</TE>
<TE>   Jabaar, who comes from the same village as Basir, is fiercely loyal to
the commander.</TE>
<TE>   "He is inspiring. He gives me money. Whatever I need, he gives me,"
says Jabaar, who was with Basir as a moujahedeen fighter. "Our No. 1
supporter is God. No. 2 is our commander. If he doesn't support me, I
won't live."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Agha, 37, formerly a Salang officer with Basir, proudly shows off
a new Datsun pickup that he took from someone he had arrested for
stealing.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the thief's. Now it's mine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Another patrolman, Sayed Agha, 27, also a former fighter with Basir,
says the rule was that police had to hand in anything seized from
criminals, including narcotics, to their commander.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a lot of" cars, he says. He explains that police could also
take other possessions of accused thieves, such as their televisions.</TE>
<TE>   At 2:55 a.m., Sayed Agha's van pulls up to a police checkpoint, but
there is no demand for a password.</TE>
<TE>   Cautiously, he eases the van around the roundabout, playing his
headlights across the scene, searching for the police.</TE>
<TE>   The white light falls on a concrete barrier, where two policemen lay
curled up like animals in a burrow.</TE>
<TE>   Sayed Agha laughs hysterically at the men's fumbled excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I was attentive," insists Mohsen, 20.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd gone to sleep," Sayed Agha reproves him. "Be careful, or
someone will steal your weapons."</TE>

<HD>Turkey's Highest Court Bars Islamist From Parliament</HD>
<DH>Government: The ruling is widely seen as part of a campaign to
stamp out religious political movements in the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>The nation's top court on Friday barred Turkey's leading Islamist
politician from holding a seat in parliament, dashing his hopes of
becoming the next prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling--the latest in a string of legal challenges hampering Recep
Tayyip Erdogan's bid to govern Turkey--is widely seen as part of a
broader campaign led by military leaders and the judiciary to stamp out
Islamic political movements in this largely Muslim but officially secular
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Erdogan was stripped of his post as Istanbul's mayor and banned from
politics for life in 1998 for reciting verses of a nationalist
poem--taught in state schools--that were deemed to incite religious
hatred. He served four months in jail for the reading, convicted under an
article of the penal code that has been used to imprison scores of
dissident politicians, journalists and academics of all political
stripes.</LD>
<TE>   In January, the Constitutional Court ruled that Erdogan's conviction
barred him from running for parliament. Publication of that ruling in
Friday's Official Gazette put the court's decision into effect and closed
off any appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Only lawmakers in the 550-member parliament are eligible to become
prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, a former professional soccer player, had insisted that he was
cleared of criminal charges under an amnesty law passed in 2000. He
downplayed the impact of the court's decision on his Justice and
Development Party.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it isn't that much of a difference," he said Friday. "It is
out of the question that this will affect our leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Murat Mercan, deputy chairman of the party, said he believes that
parliament will amend the penal code article used to convict Erdogan, to
bolster Turkey's long-running effort to join the European Union. "If we
want to become a full-blooded Western-style democracy, such laws will
have to change," he said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   Many commentators here disagree.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan's "political career may not be over, but he will not become
prime minister any time in the near future," said Rusen Cakir, a
prominent author and commentator on Islamic politics.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Turkey's ruling three-party coalition of conservatives,
ultranationalists and leftists, which commands a majority in the
parliament, is unlikely to change laws disqualifying Erdogan. Polls
consistently show his bloc far ahead of each party that makes up the
coalition, whose approval ratings have been battered by a yearlong
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's generals, who see themselves as custodians of the secular
ideals advanced by the nation's founder, Kemal Ataturk, remain bitterly
opposed to Erdogan. They maintain that Islamic radicalism is the gravest
danger facing the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The armed forces have seized power three times in the last four
decades and played a key role in unseating Turkey's first Islamic-led
government in 1997 on charges that it was seeking to introduce religious
rule. Necmettin Erbakan, who led that government and is Erdogan's mentor,
was barred from politics for five years, and his Welfare Party was
outlawed by the Constitutional Court.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamists regrouped under the Virtue Party, only to have it banned
last year for anti-secular activities.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan formed his own party and has distanced himself from the
radical rhetoric of his Islamist predecessors, saying he does not believe
in mixing religion with politics. But his attacks on birth control and
calls during recent rallies for a referendum on whether to ban alcohol
have strengthened critics' claims that he has not changed his
fundamentalist views.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, an investigation was launched over a 1992 speech
Erdogan made criticizing the army.</TE>

<HD>Marines Say Combat Training Suffers</HD>
<DH>Military: Officials point to a study that finds large areas of Camp
Pendleton are off-limits to protect a growing list of species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON
</DL>
<LD>As the Pentagon lobbies Congress for relief from the Endangered
Species Act and other environmental laws, the military points to this
sprawling base as a prime example of how such laws have severely
disrupted combat training.</LD>
<LD>   While the military has made similar claims in the past, now the Marine
Corps has a study that it says proves that training is being undercut
because large areas of the base are off-limits to protect a growing list
of species.</LD>
<LD>   "We need the ability to train as we fight," said Lt. Col. Mike Lynch,
a Marine Corps planner. "An inability to conduct realistic training puts
Marines in jeopardy."</LD>
<TE>   Preliminary results from a study conducted by Marine officials and
Newport Beach-based SRS Technologies found that in what were once prime
training zones, Marines can no longer receive adequate training in 32% to
50% of the several hundred tasks necessary for an amphibious landing.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions on digging, noise and off-road maneuvers are the most
severe, the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   According to Marine officials, a pending lawsuit by more than 30
environmental organizations could have the effect of designating more
than half of the base as protected habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bartel, supervisor of the Fish and Wildlife Service field office
that oversees the base, said, that the service already has excluded Camp
Pendleton from most critical habitat designations--land with special
protections for animals and plants listed under the Endangered Species
Act. Bartel said that of the base's approximately 125,000 acres, 6,322
have been designated as protected habitat for wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "We've continued to work cooperatively with the base so that we can
both conserve species and they can continue to do their critical
training," Bartel said.</TE>
<TE>   But Marine officials note that the restricted acreage is nearly all in
coastal training zones and that much of the rest of the base is composed
of mountains and bombing ranges that are unsuitable for troop training.</TE>
<TE>   While the base has the ability, in many instances, to move training
exercises away from environmentally sensitive areas, Marine officials are
concerned that more species could be added to the protected list and
larger areas ruled off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is not to create a nature preserve, it's to train
Marines," said Michael Collier, director of the base training resource
management division.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Meyer, general counsel of the Washington-based Public Employees
for Environmental Responsibility, immediately branded the study as
worthless and accused the Marine Corps of manufacturing a crisis by
refusing to adequately fund programs to build alternative training areas
or to relocate endangered or threatened species. "I don't buy it," Meyer
said of the Marine Corps assertion that training is being hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Within its boundaries, Camp Pendleton must contend with numerous
obstacles to training: Interstate 5, a state park, the San Onofre nuclear
power plant, hundreds of Native American architectural sites and
thousands of acres of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   But the species and habitat restrictions are of particular concern
because they have grown in recent years and could grow even more because
of lawsuits. Also, such restrictions tend to affect coastal locations
that are prime training areas for an amphibious fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Pendleton is home to 18 endangered or threatened species,
including the Pacific pocket mouse, the Stevens kangaroo rat, the Arroyo
toad and the Southwestern willow flycatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Although other bases might disagree, Camp Pendleton prides itself in
being the busiest U.S. military base in the world: with training going on
360 days a year and 40,000 troops using its 100 live-fire ranges, 30
maneuvering areas and four amphibious landing beaches.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed, the base had
three such species on the original list but more species have been added
by the fish and wildlife service, sometimes over objections from military
planners.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of its long coastline and temperate climate, San Diego
County has an unusually large array of endangered or threatened
species--37, according to the fish and wildlife service. And many of
these species live, breed or nest in the beach areas, where the Marine
Corps trains for what, by law, is its primary military mission: putting
thousands of troops and tons of fighting gear on shore quickly and
possibly while under attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps says that of its 17 miles of shoreline, only 1,500
yards (about 6%) are free of restrictions. Some restrictions are
temporary, such as ones during nesting season, but others, particularly
those for habitat, are virtually year-round.</TE>
<TE>   For example, stretches of shore called Red Beach and White Beach,
where Marines trained during World War II for the assault on Iwo Jima,
are now restricted for months on end because they include nesting areas
for the California least-tern and the Western snowy plover.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the beach not usable during mating season, the Marines'
hovercraft that bring troops to the shore cannot come too close because
their noise might disturb the birds, Marines said.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking a training "scenario" into parts--with Marines trucked from
location to location to avoid off-limits areas--robs them of the reality
factor in preparing for war, the Marines insist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're learning bad habits" because of unrealistic training, said Maj.
Curtis Hill.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, young Marines stretching camouflage over tents and
other items made sure to leave an 18-inch gap between the camouflage and
the ground--as they had been taught during training at Twentynine Palms.
The 18-inch gap is meant to allow desert tortoises to walk through a
bivouac.</TE>
<TE>   But in combat such a gap can throw a shadow that an enemy might spot
and thus discover where Marines are concealed. More seasoned Marines saw
the gaps and ordered the camouflage stretched to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt came to Camp Pendleton
to laud base officials for setting a standard for other military bases in
how to balance the military's need for training and the government's
desire to protect flora and fauna.</TE>
<TE>   But litigation by environmental groups has been aimed at increasing
the number of species afforded protection and also adding habitat areas
to the protected list.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're experiencing is regulation by litigation," said base
environmental planner Stan Norquist, "If we're going to do that we need
something in the law to give guidance to the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Marines concede that there are alternatives to training at Camp
Pendleton but add that those alternatives are expensive and could depress
troop morale. One alternative is more training at Twentynine Palms, where
there are fewer protected species, or in foreign countries, but that
would mean separating troops from their families.</TE>
<TE>   "We've employed work-arounds but we've gotten to the point where
work-arounds won't work," Collier said.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Asks Easing of Rules</HD>
<DH>Environment: The White House wants to restrict protections for
marine mammals. Changes are being sought to six laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is seeking to restrict protections for
marine mammals as part of a sweeping proposal to exempt the military from
key provisions of environmental legislation.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon's proposed changes to six landmark environmental laws
were presented to Congress in briefings Thursday. Draft legislation was
delivered Friday evening to Capitol Hill. Members of Congress begin
drafting the defense authorization bill next week.</LD>
<LD>   The Marine Mammal Protection Act forbids--with certain
exceptions--harassing, hunting, capturing or killing whales, dolphins or
any other marine mammals.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists charge that the Pentagon's proposal would dilute the
definition of "harassment" so much that the National Marine Fisheries
Service would find it difficult to regulate military activities that
affect marine mammals. The changes also would make it harder for citizens
and environmental groups to sue the military for endangering marine
mammals.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's proposal, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,
also would give the military exemptions under the Clean Air Act, the
Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and hazardous waste
laws.</TE>
<TE>   According to the military, environmental laws have inhibited training
at bases across the country and on the waters offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "We have increasingly faced the inescapable fact that more and more
training lands are now unavailable for us for this realistic combat
live-fire training that is so necessary," Raymond DuBois, deputy
undersecretary of Defense for installations and environment, said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's proposed changes are intended to reverse that trend, he
said, adding, "It will save lives in real combat."</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists and their supporters in Congress accused the
Bush administration of trying to take advantage of a wartime situation.
They also charged that President Bush is ignoring his principle of giving
states a say in policy changes that seriously affect them and is breaking
a campaign pledge to make federal agencies comply with the same laws that
govern private industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department "has not established the need for these
significant exemptions from federal environmental laws and has failed to
consider the views of state and local interests," said Rep. John D.
Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over pollution laws. The
Pentagon "should concentrate on complying with the law and cleaning up
the environment instead of seeking special preference to continue as the
nation's greatest polluter."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Johnson, a legislative aide for Rep. James V. Hansen (R-Utah), an
ardent promoter of the Pentagon's proposal, described it as a
common-sense change to laws that have overburdened the military and
restricted training efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not broad waivers," Johnson said. "There are no exemptions
for the Department of Defense, no rolling back of decades of
environmental law--none of that has happened."</TE>
<TE>   The law changes outlined in the briefing documents include:</TE>
<TE>   * Freeing the military from the permits and record-keeping required by
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act when migratory birds are killed or harmed
during training exercises.</TE>
<TE>   * Exempting explosives and munitions from the definition of solid
waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Under this
change, the Environmental Protection Agency still could step in if
military ranges were polluting land or water outside firing ranges.</TE>
<TE>   * Allowing the military extra time to comply with state plans for
meeting federal air quality requirements under the Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   * Excluding military bases that already have management plans to
protect endangered plants and animals from having their territory
designated as critical habitat by the Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Marine Mammal Act, the definition of harassment
would be restricted to include only "biologically significant effects,"
such as death, injury and "disruption of significant activities."</TE>
<TE>   The military's goals, DuBois said, are to avoid lawsuits for merely
"annoying" a marine mammal and to prevent the need to get permits every
time an aircraft carrier changes position. The current "hair-trigger"
application of the broad definition has "profoundly affected" vital
research and development efforts and training, he added.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a scientific study funded by the Pentagon showed that a
new long-range, lower-frequency sonar designed to detect ultra-quiet
enemy submarines would "harass" marine mammals under the existing
definition. So the Navy is waiting for a letter of authorization from the
Fisheries Service to allow use of the sonar. If the definition of
harassment were changed, the Navy likely would have greater leeway in
using the sonar without seeking permission.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and scientists warned that, by narrowing the
definition, the Pentagon could endanger marine mammals. Not enough is
known about the animals' behavior to know what changes in their
activities might signify real danger to them, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, a
conservative public policy center in Arlington, Va., said there is no
question that marine mammals would suffer from the legislative change.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was a porpoise, I'd say it's time to retain a lawyer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But given the current climate on Capitol Hill, that may be a trade-off
Congress is willing to make, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the threat increased, people are more likely to think that the
military requirement is more important than the environmental issue."</TE>

<HD>FBI Offers Reward in Prosecutor's Killing</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>FBI officials said Friday they have "reason to believe" there is a
potential witness with information about the killing of federal
prosecutor Thomas C. Wales, a gun control advocate who was shot through a
window in his home six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Announcing a $1-million reward posted by the Justice Department for
information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case, local FBI
chief Charles Mandigo said authorities have made progress in the
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "We have come to the point where we do have reason to believe that
someone, either knowingly or unknowingly, has knowledge of this
homicide," Mandigo, the bureau's special agent in charge, told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   "It is past time, in the name of honor and decency, [for them] to step
forward," he said. "We will not rest or diminish our efforts until the
person or persons responsible are brought to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Wales, 49, was an 18-year prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office
in Seattle, specializing in white-collar fraud cases. He was also the
board president of Washington CeaseFire, one of the nation's best-known
regional gun control organizations.</TE>
<TE>   He is the first prominent gun control activist to fall victim to
handgun violence and, if his death is linked to one of his
investigations, Mandigo said, the first federal prosecutor to be slain as
a result of his duties.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has placed a priority on solving the case,
which so far has produced no identified suspects. The FBI has six agents
assigned to the case full time, with up to 20 agents working on it from
time to time--more than have ever been assigned to a single case in the
region, even the high-profile investigation of international terrorism
suspect Ahmed Ressam two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran organized crime prosecutor Joshua Nesbitt is supervising the
investigation, and the Seattle Police Department also has two detectives
on the case full time.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom's death left a huge hole in this community," Police Chief Gil
Kerlikowske said Friday. "Prosecutors aren't armed law enforcement
agents, but they are really and truly on the front line, and I think it's
incredibly important that we bring the person or persons responsible to
justice."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the case said detectives have scrutinized at least
one criminal suspect targeted by Wales in his work as a prosecutor,
though they are continuing to look at other possibilities in the more
than 100 interviews conducted so far.</TE>
<TE>   Wales, who was divorced and lived alone, was sitting at his computer
near a basement window late on the night of Oct. 11 when someone fired
several shots through the window, hitting him twice. A neighbor said she
saw a man walk quickly down the street and get into a car.</TE>
<TE>   Mandigo declined to elaborate on why investigators believe someone may
have information about the case. Asked whether it could include a driver
or someone who wasn't aware he or she had seen evidence of a homicide, he
nodded and said: "Of that general nature."</TE>
<TE>   Wales was a tenacious prosecutor with a 100% conviction record, but he
had an affable personality that won him friends on both sides of the
counsel table. Friends and family said he had no known enemies, though he
had been threatened anonymously in the course of his work with Washington
CeaseFire.</TE>
<TE>   Mandigo said it is important to know whether Wales' killing was
connected to his work as a prosecutor. "I think it's important for the
integrity of the law enforcement system, either way, one way or another,
to know. And the only way to do that is to bring the responsible person
to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a nation of law. We are not a nation of 'Solve your problem
with a gun.' "</TE>

<LD>Government lawyers told a federal judge they will seek the death
penalty if they win a criminal conviction against a retired Air Force
master sergeant on charges he tried to spy for Iraq, Libya and China.</LD>
<LD>   The government accused Brian Patrick Regan, 39, of creating a "grave
risk of death" to U.S. military pilots patrolling the no-fly zone over
Iraq. Regan allegedly intended to sell Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein secret
details about American satellites that could help Iraq hide its
antiaircraft missiles.</LD>
<LD>   Regan has pleaded not guilty to the charges in federal court.</LD>

<HD>Profiling Claims Lead to 86 Cases Being Dropped</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state attorney general agreed to drop criminal charges
involving 86 cases in which defendants claimed they were targets of
racial profiling.</LD>
<LD>   The cases involve minority motorists who were stopped and searched by
state troopers and later charged with various drug and weapon offenses.</LD>
<LD>   The decision involved 100 defendants charged from 1989 through 2001, a
spokesman for the attorney general said; 59 convictions involve people
who have served time, been paroled or will be eligible for parole within
a year. Those convictions will be erased, defense attorneys said.</LD>
<TE>   Appeals court rulings allowed defendants stopped before April 20,
1999, to challenge their cases if they thought they were targeted by
biased troopers. That was the date the state admitted troopers practiced
profiling.</TE>

<LD>President Bush got behind the wheel of a sports car, put it in
reverse and executed an escape maneuver during a tour of the Secret
Service training center in Beltsville.</LD>
<LD>   Under the watchful eyes of Secret Service experts, a spokesman said,
Bush backed a 2002 Chevrolet Camaro down a practice track and spun 180
degrees at 40 mph. The car continued front-end-first in the same
direction--an evasive maneuver known as the "J turn."</LD>
<LD>   Bush also fired several guns during his visit to the unmarked,
493-acre complex outside Washington.</LD>

<LD>At the Iowa City, Iowa, college bar Et Cetera there was clapping
and cheering as bartenders--showing off a trick of the trade picked up in
Acapulco--poured rum on the bar top and set it ablaze. But the flickering
line of fire got out of control and at least six people were burned,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   "All of a sudden, there was a huge fireball. . . . The whole group
[against the bar] started screaming," said Scott VandenBusch, a student
from Franklin, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   The bartenders could face criminal charges after investigators review
whether fire codes were violated, officials said, adding that the
bartenders apparently expected the flames to burn out quickly.</LD>

<HD>11 Stowaways Find Dangerous Passage</HD>
<DH>Entry: Four of the Dominican men were hospitalized for dehydration
after spending a week inside a cargo container.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<AU>ANNA M. VIRTUE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>The 11 Dominican men came to the United States in a locked,
stifling cargo container in search of the American dream--and it almost
cost them their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the stowaways, who had been trapped inside the 40-foot
container for a week, were recovering in a hospital Friday, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   An employee assigned to check the container seals had heard banging
and muffled shouts and alerted authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "We do checks of seals on unloading," said Mike Leon, security manager
of Antillean Marine Shipping. "One seal was broken."</TE>
<TE>   When police and fire rescuers opened the container at a marine
shipping yard in Hialeah, Fla., Thursday, the temperature inside was over
100 degrees, Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were dehydrated," Leon said. "They are very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Hialeah Police Department,
explained that "they snuck into the container Friday [April 12], but the
ship didn't sail for the U.S. until Sunday. . . . They ran out of food
and water."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez paused.</TE>
<TE>   "They would rather die in their attempt to make it to our country," he
said. "It says a lot for our country."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the men decided to hide in the cargo container aboard
the vessel Carib Trader in Santo Domingo. They brought provisions for a
three day voyage and tools, including screwdrivers, hammers, knives and a
crowbar.</TE>
<TE>   The stowaways used the tools to poke an air hole the size of a fist
through one of the container's seals.</TE>
<TE>   But, police said, they did not count on the cargo ship's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of heading straight to the United States, it made another stop
in the Dominican Republic and didn't leave the second port until Sunday
and arrived in Florida on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the 11 people the police discovered inside the container were
in the advanced stages of dehydration and were rushed to a hospital in
Hialeah. The other seven were taken to three other area hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Leon visited the three who were still hospitalized in
stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't talk to them. They were tired and groggy," he said. "I let
them eat and sleep."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol said all the Dominicans were
charged with entering the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Those not in the hospital were taken to an immigration jail and will
be returned to the Dominican Republic.</TE>

<DH>Terrorism: The U.S. hopes to improve tracking of the boxes--easily
capable of hiding huge bombs-- and to hinder tampering.</DH>

<LD>Amid warnings that another terrorist strike might come tucked
inside one of the 17,000 cargo containers that enter the United States
each day, researchers are scrambling to make the nondescript metal
boxes--and their modes of delivery--tamper-proof.</LD>
<LD>   Industry leaders and federal authorities are particularly concerned
that such an attack could prompt the closure of ports, disrupting supply
chain flows and imperiling the national economy, according to a white
paper about the problem prepared for the U.S. Department of
Transportation.</LD>
<LD>   "For right now, securing our freight supply lines is a priority of the
United States, one being tackled at the highest levels of government,"
said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Tony Regalbuto, acting director of port
security nationwide. "If someone were trying to export a dirty nuclear
bomb, for example, a shipping container might be a way to do it."</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Customs Service currently is able to inspect only 2% of the 7
million 20- to 40-foot-long containers that arrive each year loaded with
goods ranging from rugs and frozen squid to athletic shoes and sports
cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Shut down all ports and you damage world trade, crippling 27% of the
economy, throwing people out of work and turning the stock market into a
demolition derby," said Michael Wolfe, a transportation technologies and
security expert and the author of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   "Shut them down for two months," Wolfe said, "and you've handed
terrorists a multi-trillion-dollar victory."</TE>
<TE>   With federal homeland security authorities predicting that another
terrorist attack is all but certain, scientists from Silicon Valley to
New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory are trying to develop
comprehensive freight shipment systems similar to those now used to move
high-tech military equipment and nuclear materials.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to acquire the ability to ensure ironclad security,
tracking and information profiles of each container--from its point of
origin to its final destination, without choking off commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "There are vulnerabilities and opportunities for terrorism galore in
this country," Regalbuto said.</TE>
<TE>   Preventing a "bomb in a box" is only one of the aims of the proposed
systems to be discussed at a three-day national conference at the Long
Beach Convention Center beginning April 27.</TE>
<TE>   Most proposed security measures involve an array of high-tech
electronic seals, tags and transponders installed in the frames of the
containers. Studded with the latest wireless communication devices, such
containers would use satellites to signal from ships more than 100 miles
out at sea that "I'm secure" or "I'm not OK."</TE>
<TE>   In the event of bad news, a freighter could be diverted to a military
port or ordered to stay put until its load could be inspected at sea,
Coast Guard officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Savi Technology, of Sunnyvale, Calif., which provides asset management
and security systems for the Defense Department, later this year plans to
launch a pilot demonstration in Singapore of a sealing and anti-tamper
system for ocean and air cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   "As many as 28 parties around the world may be involved with each
shipping container," said Lance Trebesch, Savi vice president of
transportation security and productivity. "It is absolutely necessary to
know what's in them, as well as to know its manufacturers, shippers,
financial backers and brokers."</TE>
<TE>   The most closely watched cargo container in history will likely be one
packed with light bulbs and dispatched later this month from a factory in
Nove Zamky, Slovakia, to Hillsborough, N.H., as part of a $200,000
experiment called Operation Safe Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The container's progress--by truck from Nove Zamky to the Port of
Hamburg, Germany; by ship to Montreal; then by truck to an Osram Sylvania
plant in Hillsborough--will be scrutinized by a group of top federal
transportation, safety and law enforcement authorities and corporate
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The container's seals will be repeatedly verified and its contents
cross-checked with cargo manifests. At one or more points, "control
groups" may try to break into the box without being detected, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to learn a lot about what works and what doesn't in terms of
securing containers," Regalbuto said, "and about the strengths and
weaknesses in supply chains."</TE>
<TE>   Created in the 1950s to streamline cargo handling and reduce pilferage
in ports, cargo containers account for 90% of the world's traded cargo by
value. They support supply chains that are complex, fragile and driven by
firms operating on thin profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   They were designed for efficiency and profit, not for security.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's marine transportation system handles more than 2 billion
tons of freight, 3 billion tons of oil and 7 million containers every
year. It is linked to surface transportation systems by "intermodal
connectors"--terminals, highways, railways and pipelines--used by the 11
million truck and rail containers that cross the Mexican and Canadian
borders into the United States each year.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. freight systems are interwoven with vastly more complicated
global networks.</TE>
<TE>   The "webs of lean supply chains," according to the white paper, "imply
that transportation disruptions would cause wider, deeper impacts sooner
than suggested by historical experience, such as with strikes and natural
disasters."</TE>
<TE>   The paper also suggests that the psychological effect of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks magnified the economic damages, which some experts
believe have exceeded $1 trillion in lost growth and decreased equity
worldwide, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack contributed to airline industry losses of about $5 billion
last year, in part because people were simply afraid to fly. Two-day
waits for cargo screening at the U.S.-Canadian border triggered near
panic among Detroit car makers, who rely on Canada for parts.</TE>
<TE>   Enhanced security will be expensive, officials say, but will have
benefits that go beyond safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the potential for doom and ruin we're concerned about,"
Wolfe said. "If those systems are thoughtfully done, they can
simultaneously improve both security and economic efficiency. This is a
tremendous opportunity to make real progress."</TE>

<HD>9/11, Oklahoma Victims Share Silence at Event</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY
</DL>
<LD>Several World Trade Center families and those who lost loved ones
in the Oklahoma bombing comforted each other Friday at ceremonies marking
the seventh anniversary of what had been until Sept. 11 the deadliest act
of terrorism on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 Sept. 11 relatives, survivors and rescue workers stood with
Oklahomans for 168 seconds of silence in memory of the 168 people killed
in the bombing of the federal building on April 19, 1995. Church bells
broke the quiet.</LD>
<LD>   "Today they look just as sad as us," said Nicole Petrocelli, whose
husband, Mark, died at the trade center. "I can see from the expressions
on the faces that the pain is never going to go away. But it gives me
hope to see that they are a little stronger than we are."</LD>
<TE>   Standing under the branches of an elm that survived the blast, many
wiped tears as a guitarist played "Amazing Grace" and when a bombing
survivor sang "Let There Be Peace on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Families of New York victims placed one white carnation on each of the
empty bronze chairs where the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building once
stood.</TE>
<TE>   William Rodriguez, who was pulled from the rubble of the World Trade
Center, said he came to thank the Oklahoma City bombing victims who
visited New York last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The support that they gave us was very important because we didn't
have any cathartic, emotional exchange with anyone who had gone through
what we were going through," he said. "They are actually teaching us how
to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of both tragedies said they share a bond that is
unbreakable.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquetta Lair, who placed a bouquet of yellow roses on a chair for
her cousin, Oleta Biddy, said she knows how it feels to wait while
rescuers search through the rubble. Her cousin's body was not recovered
for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going through now what we tried to get through then," Lair
said. "It was always there in your face, and you couldn't get past it."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, many toured a new exhibit in the memorial museum
that focuses on the similar experiences of terrorist victims.</TE>

<HD>Renewed Destroyer Cole Gets Heroic Welcome Back to Duty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PASCAGOULA, Miss.
</DL>
<LD>A patched and battle-ready guided missile destroyer Cole returned
to duty with a flag-waving, horn-blasting send-off Friday, a year and a
half after a terrorist bombing in Yemen blew a hole in its side and
killed 17 sailors.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people cheered along the shore as the Cole, gleaming in
the sunlight, set off from Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Ingalls Shipyard for
its home port in Norfolk, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Cole returns to duty after 14 months of repairs and improvements.
Seventeen stars were laid in the destroyer' hallway floor, one for each
of the sailors killed in the blast Oct. 12, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The ship's 300 sailors, including about 40 who survived the attack,
made their way aboard the Cole at dawn Friday at the same shipyard where
it was built and christened in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network has been blamed by U.S. officials
for both the Sept. 11 attacks and the Cole blast, carried out by
terrorists who pulled an explosives-laden skiff alongside the destroyer.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Kevin Sweeney said he did not know where the vessel will be
deployed after its return to Norfolk.</TE>

<HD>Braking Cited in Amtrak Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Engineer said he saw buckled area and tried to stop. The
NTSB said four other trains had just passed over the same tracks without
incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT CITY, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The engineer aboard the popular Amtrak Auto Train that crashed in
this stretch of verdant Florida countryside told investigators Friday
that the train derailed after he spied what he thought was deformed track
and pulled the emergency brake.</LD>
<LD>   The reasons why sudden braking might have caused more than half the
train's 40 cars to skid off the rails Thursday remained unclear, however.
Federal officials said the train was traveling at 56 mph, under the
60-mph limit in effect on that stretch of track.</LD>
<LD>   Two men and two women died in the accident, including a married
couple; their identities were not released. Of the 166 people sent to
hospitals throughout North Florida, 12 remained hospitalized Friday,
including a member of the crew.</LD>
<TE>   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Russ Quimby said the
engineer, whose name was not released, reported he had seen "a heat
kink," a buckling of the rails that can be caused by high temperatures.
But CSX Transportation, which owns and maintains the tracks here, told
federal officials the temperature was 81 degrees at the time of the
accident, hardly torrid by Florida standards.</TE>
<TE>   Also, NTSB officials said that just before the wreck, four other
trains passed without reported incident over the same tracks south of
Crescent City, including a coal train that preceded the Auto Train by no
more than eight minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The engineer "saw some kind of track irregularity to which he reacted
with the emergency brakes," said NTSB member George Black, who arrived to
oversee the investigation. "We will examine essentially every inch of the
rail that is in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak's Auto Train is unique in the rail service, transporting people
along with their vehicles. Thursday's train carried 202 vehicles on 24
auto transport cars. Black said the investigation would consider whether
that much weight concentrated at the end of the 4,000-foot-long train,
which Amtrak calls the world's longest, might have been a factor.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Train, which was bound for Lorton, Va., outside Washington,
jackknifed about an hour after leaving Sanford, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday evening, the Florida Highway Patrol reported six
fatalities, but Amtrak Vice President Cheryle Robinson Jackson said law
enforcement authorities apparently miscounted in the confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Train carried 418 passengers, including some children, and 34
crew members, according to an Amtrak manifest.</TE>
<TE>   Black said Friday that three of the victims apparently were hurled
from the train as 14 of the 16 passenger cars left the tracks. Some of
the cars toppled onto their sides or plunged into the ditch alongside the
rail line.</TE>
<TE>   Police, sheriff's officers and fire rescue teams from many counties of
North and Central Florida responded to the accident, Amtrak's deadliest
in more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Recordings of 911 cell phone calls from people inside the wrecked
train were released Friday, giving an indication of their harrowing
ordeal. Some passengers were trapped for as long as an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "Our car is completely flipped over. We saw a car completely pinned
between two other cars. I see cars toppled like Tinker Toys," one caller
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The car I was in, there was a man with his head split open," another
caller said. "There were a couple of elderly people pinned under their
seats."</TE>
<TE>   During one call, a woman begins yelling, "911 says help is on its way!
Spread the word!"</TE>
<TE>   According to Amtrak officials, a chef in the Auto Train's dining car
sustained serious burns on his arms and legs when he was thrown against a
hot grill, but he ignored his injuries to help other people escape. Local
media identified him as Harry Gissendanner and said he had been admitted
to a Daytona Beach hospital.</TE>
<TE>   One injured passenger, a 73-year-old woman, was reported in critical
condition at the University of Florida's Shands Hospital in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 of the cars being transported on the train were taken
Friday to the Sanford train station, where passengers are reclaiming
them. Seven of the transport cars derailed, but the extent of any damage
to the vehicles inside was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   As federal regulations mandate, the Auto Train's engineer and other
crew members were given blood and urine tests to determine whether they
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Black said the results
would be available after the samples are examined at a Federal Aviation
Administration laboratory in Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI agent also was involved in the investigation, but Black said
foul play was not suspected.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Amtrak, the nation's
passenger rail line, has taken various steps to increase the security of
its operations, including hiring more inspectors to check stations and
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   In this remote area of the Sunshine State 60 miles north of Orlando,
where large-scale farms grow ferns for the nation's florists, helmeted
workers sweating in the afternoon sun labored Friday to clear the tracks
of wreckage. Spewing black smoke from their diesel engines, four
bulldozer-mounted cranes, known as sidewinders, toiled together, lifting
a derailed train car at one end like automobile tow trucks and returning
it to a section of undamaged track.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak flew in at least 50 employees to assist passengers. "We're
putting them up in hotels overnight, buying them food, clothes,
toiletries, whatever," Jackson said of the stranded passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck of the Auto Train was Amtrak's deadliest accident since
March 15, 1999, when a train hit a truck and derailed near Bourbonnais,
Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more than 100.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak officials said operations on the line, an important rail artery
linking Florida with the rest of the country, likely would be suspended
through today. Amtrak's Miami-bound trains use a different route and
should be unaffected, Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>FDA Changes Course on Child Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration is backing off its controversial
suspension of a rule requiring drug companies to perform safety testing
of adult medicines children commonly get.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA last month said that because Congress recently passed
financial incentives for drug makers to conduct those studies, it wanted
to see whether the new law makes the old mandate--which drug makers
hated--unnecessary. So it announced a two-year suspension of the
so-called pediatric rule.</LD>
<LD>   The action caused a storm of controversy. Members of Congress
complained that the FDA was injuring children's health and this week
announced plans for legislation that would have forced the agency to put
the mandate back in place.</LD>
<TE>   Also Friday, the FDA began soliciting public comment through July on
whether the rule overlaps too much with the financial incentives and new
federal funding of child drug research--or if all the measures leave gaps
that still need filling.</TE>
<TE>   But "we did not want to leave children unprotected" while that debate
goes on, said the FDA's Dr. Murray Lumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Bush administration officials announced that the National
Institutes of Health would provide $7 million for similar pediatric drug
research this year.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers welcomed the FDA's reversal. But Sens. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio),
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) said
they still would try to make the pediatric rule law--in case FDA
officials change their mind again.</TE>
<TE>   Adult medications are given to children without studies of their
safety or proper dosing because doctors have no alternative.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's pediatric rule was adopted in 1998.</TE>

<LD>   "Now the nitty-gritty starts," said Larry Berg, the founding director
of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "Get out the money
and take the gloves off and start debating this issue.</LD>
<LD>   "Secessionists really have had pretty much of a free ride in terms of
influencing the public," he added. "Now I think we're going to see a
full-blown campaign. And I think it's going to be a lot harder for them
to get the vote than they think it is."</LD>
<TE>   Before the Local Agency Formation Commission can put any secession
measure on the ballot, it is required to determine that the seceding area
would be financially viable and that secession would not hurt the city
left behind. A report issued Friday clears that hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   But viability isn't a very high standard, something opponents of
secession will start pointing out, said Cal State Fullerton political
scientist Raphael Sonenshein.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they will start to poke holes into this idea of viability, to
talk about what it means," he said. "You can always make a debate that a
city is viable, that it can exist, but that doesn't answer the key
questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Will services be better or worse or the same? Will taxes end up
higher or lower or the same? Now all these assumptions are at last
subject to a real back and forth, a real argument."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of secession who have been trying to get their points across
say they're expecting much more help now--not just from Mayor James K.
Hahn, who has promised to raise $5 million to fight secession ballot
measures, but from the many people who have said they were waiting to
read the LAFCO reports before deciding where they stand.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you will be hearing in the next few weeks more people
stepping up to the plate and not saying, 'Well, I want to hear the
study.' I think more people will be taking it seriously at last," said
Irene Tovar, president of the Latin American Civic Assn. and a veteran
organizer in the mostly Latino Northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get out there and start challenging all the LAFCO
assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's report concerned only the viability of San Fernando Valley
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Still unknown, and potentially pivotal, is LAFCO's final stand on two
other secession movements--for an independent Hollywood and harbor area.
For any secession measure to pass, a majority vote is required not just
in the seceding area but in the city as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   That structure creates possibilities for strategic alliances that
could help all three efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "You may be having people from three different cities working together
on a combined yes vote, and that could be very effective," said
Republican strategist Arnold Steinberg. "From a mathematical standpoint,
they'd have to be better off together.</TE>
<TE>   "Right away, you've almost got a majority talking about cityhood."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, that's how Hollywood secessionist Gene LaPietra, president
of Hollywood Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, was thinking. He said
he was thrilled with Friday's LAFCO report on the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big day for all of us. It just takes us to a whole new level,"
he said. "It's legitimacy. The report is a conclusive work done with $2
million of effort to get the truth."</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects an equally positive report on an independent
Hollywood, and predicts people all over the city will join the
secessionist bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   But what some see as strength in numbers may also spark fears, said
Rick Taylor, who has run many Los Angeles political campaigns. The idea
of three chunks of Los Angeles wanting to break away at once could hurt
secession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be too much and backfire, because when people start thinking
about the breaking up of the city totally, it may scare people, too," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Taylor, who personally opposes secession, said he must
acknowledge its growing momentum. "I used to think it was impossible. Now
I think it's a horse race," Taylor said. "I'm really surprised at how
much support secession has."</TE>

<HD>Israel's Invasions, 20 Years Apart, Look Eerily Alike</HD>
<DH>History: Sharon's forces went into Lebanon, as they have into the
West Bank, to fight terrorism. The negative results may well be similar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Twenty years ago, Israel set out to rearrange the geopolitical
balance in the region by invading Lebanon. The result--for Israel, the
Palestinians, the United States and the peace process--was a catastrophe
whose lessons should not be forgotten by either the warriors or the
peacemakers in the current West Bank conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The circumstances of the two military adventures are eerily similar.
So is the cast of characters, as well as the high stakes involved for
Washington. Israel's reasons for taking the offensive in Lebanon and the
West Bank were the same: to root out terrorism. The world's angry
reaction was the same. So much is unchanged that one Israeli newspaper
has called the current crisis "Sharon versus Arafat, Round II."</LD>
<LD>   Today, as he was in Lebanon, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
trapped by the forces of Ariel Sharon, now Israel's prime minister.
Refugee camps look as though they have been struck by an earthquake. The
United States is once again oddly uninfluential with Israel and less than
accommodating to Palestinians. As one Israeli columnist put it,
rephrasing Marx, people should remember that history occurs twice--first
as tragedy, then as super-tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   In April 1982, Arafat was ensconced in his Beirut fiefdom, running a
state within a state from which he could attack the Golan and Galilee
regions. Sharon, then the defense minister, wanted Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization out of Lebanon and asked U.S. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig for a green light to invade. Haig didn't say yes; more
important, he didn't say no.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the 20th century. You can't just invade a country like that,"
Philip C. Habib, President Reagan's envoy to the region, told Sharon. But
Habib, like Anthony C. Zinni, who has a similar role under President
Bush, had no luck reining in Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, on June 6, Israel rolled across the border in tanks.
Sharon's planners had figured that they could clean up Lebanon in a week
with no more than 100 casualties. Operation Peace for Galilee was to be
limited, creating a 25-mile-deep buffer zone in southern Lebanon and, on
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's orders, stopping far short of Beirut.
Five weeks later, his top general rode into the Beirut neighborhood of
Baabda in an armored personnel carrier, hot on Arafat's trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon lied his way to Beirut," Nicholas A. Veliotes, assistant
secretary of State and ambassador to Egypt in the Reagan administration,
recalled recently. "His ostensible reason for the invasion approved by
the Cabinet was to create a cordon sanitaire in the south; in reality, he
had decided to seek to solve the Palestinian problem by military force."</TE>
<TE>   In Lebanon, as in the West Bank today, Israeli forces shredded
Palestinian archives, payrolls, even students' academic records.
Infrastructure was demolished, computers smashed. Terrorists and
innocents alike were killed. Homes were blown up and bulldozed, refugee
camps besieged. To critics, it appeared that Sharon was as intent on
crippling the Palestinian spirit as he was on eradicating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Bush administration really understands who it is
dealing with today," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist
associated with the Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon is a tactical tank commander, and he responds as one," Kipper
said. "No one would have condemned him for going into the West Bank with
commandos to go after individuals and groups responsible for terrorism.
But a massive invasion of this nature is, in the long run, going to work
against Israel's interests. And those of the United States. The
repercussions are likely to be considerable."</TE>
<TE>   In Lebanon, they certainly were. The invasion gave birth to the
Hezbollah terrorist organization. It brought Iranians into the Bekaa
Valley, which in turn led to the kidnapping of Americans. And it
unleashed the phenomenon of suicide bombings, first at the U.S. Embassy
in Beirut, then at a U.S. Marine barracks, where 241 Americans died.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials dismiss parallels between Lebanon and the West Bank,
pointing out that today ruthless terrorists are operating inside Israel,
not in some other country. Indeed, although many Israelis, including
members of the opposition Labor Party, opposed the Lebanon incursion, 75%
of Israelis support Sharon's ironfisted actions in the West Bank,
according to one poll.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's siege of Beirut lasted 70 days and its occupation of southern
Lebanon 18 years. The war claimed thousands of lives--half of them
civilian, Lebanon says--and destroyed Israel's image, perhaps forever, as
an underdog battling aggressive Arabs. It resulted in the evacuation of
Arafat and his guerrillas to scattered Arab nations. It led Arabs to view
the U.S. as a co-aggressor, particularly because the operation had
largely been completed by the time Reagan called Prime Minister Begin to
complain of "needless destruction and bloodshed."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what this war taught us," Arafat told an American
journalist the day he boarded a ship for exile to Tunisia. "It taught us
that the real enemy is the United States. It is against you that we must
fight. Not because your bombs killed our people but because you have
closed your eyes to what is moral and just."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Reagan's senior advisors favored talking tough to the Arabs
and declaring Israel a "strategic asset" in the struggle against the
Soviet Union, a policy that would have obscured the Palestinian issue in
the larger context of Middle East peace. They included Paul Wolfowitz,
Douglas Feith, Richard Pearl, Peter Rodman and James Roche.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bush was hesitant to step into the Israeli-Palestinian
quagmire. When he did, critics say, it was primarily because Palestinian
suicide bombings fit into the context of the war on terrorism and because
he needed the support of moderate Arab leaders--who were critical of his
inaction--in order to carry the war to Iraq. Among Bush's top advisors
today are Wolfowitz, Feith, Pearl, Rodman and Roche.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, while Arafat jetted around the world like a head of state
after being forced out of Lebanon, Sharon's career was derailed by
Beirut, where, in the final days of the siege, a Christian militia
aligned with Israel massacred at least 700 Palestinian civilians in the
Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. A court of inquiry said Sharon bore
indirect responsibility, and he was forced to resign. Many Israelis
disdained him as a disgraced commander and the architect of the Lebanon
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Just as ironically, it was Arafat who almost single-handedly rescued
Sharon from political oblivion. By walking away from a far-reaching
Israeli peace offer in 2000, then overseeing an escalation in terror
against Israel, Arafat made even moderate Israelis yearn for an
uncompromising leader who would stop at nothing to secure their borders.
The man they chose as their new prime minister was Sharon, who had once
suggested "transferring" all Palestinians to Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has defeated Arafat in the West Bank, as surely as he did in
Lebanon. But few Israelis believe that will end terrorism, and many are
thinking back to Lebanon, asking: "What's next? How do we prevent history
from repeating itself?"</TE>
