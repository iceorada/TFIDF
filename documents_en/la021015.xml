<HD>Despite cutting commentary, 'Barbershop' sequel's planned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>In Hollywood, controversy rarely hurts the bottom line, so it came as
no surprise when MGM over the weekend disclosed plans for a sequel to
"Barbershop," the breakout comedy about life in a Chicago barbershop,
which has earned more than $65 million at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   The studio is already in talks to bring back star Ice Cube,
although the script does not yet exist. "We're still flushing it out.
We're looking into the history of how the barbershop came into
existence," says director Tim Story, who also will helm the sequel.
He hopes to reunite the entire cast, which includes Anthony Anderson,
Sean Patrick Thomas, Eve and Cedric the Entertainer.</LD>
<LD>   The original producers, Robert Teitel and George Tillman Jr., and
one of the original screenwriters, Don S. Scott, are also returning.</LD>
<TE>   Although the lighthearted comedy was widely embraced by audiences,
particularly African American audiences, it sparked criticism from
some of the nation's black leaders for irreverent jokes about such
civil rights figures as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson. In a controversial scene, Eddie, a character
played by Cedric, denigrates King, Parks and others.</TE>
<TE>   Several other barbershop patrons recoil from his comments, but
Eddie continues to riff humorously.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson publicly chastised the filmmaking team for making fun of
figures that he believed should be immune from mockery. The Rev. Al
Sharpton demanded an apology from MGM, which was not forthcoming, nor
was removal of the offending scene from the video release. Sharpton
also declared his intention to call for a boycott of the studio. MGM
representatives said Monday they were not aware of any organized
protests.</TE>
<TE>   Story says the controversy didn't wind up hurting the picture, nor
will it influence the sequel. "At the end of the day, it became
conversation, which is the only thing we ever wished it would be."</TE>

<LD>Blue Shoe</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Anne Lamott</LD>
<TE>   Riverhead Books, 292 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When you invite God into your life," Anne Lamott wrote in "Bird
by Bird," her bestselling book about the writing life, "you think he
or she is going to come into your psychic house, look around and see
that you just need a new floor or better furniture.... Then you look
out the window one day and see that there's a wrecking ball outside.
It turns out that God actually thinks your whole foundation is shot
and you're going to have to start over from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   Lamott -- who writes extensively about God, recovery and faith in
both fiction and nonfiction, often juxtaposing these mystical
elements with the tough realities of life and a biting humor --
returns to this theme in "Blue Shoe." Mattie Ryder, a divorced mother
of two who moves back into her childhood home after her widowed
mother moves into a senior complex, finds the house falling down
around her. Her mother has disguised extensive damage with paint and
caulking, and wherever rot, cracks or mold had appeared, she had
installed makeshift cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   This mold is not confined to the edifice of the house; it serves
as a metaphor for the rot permeating the entire familial structure.
There are secrets, old wounds that have been left festering, decay
that has been covered up. As Mattie struggles to make both her
physical and psychic house more habitable, she must decide which
damage requires eradication and which flaws can be lived with. Her
mother, meanwhile, begins to suffer from dementia, Mattie's young
children endure the anguish of their parents' recent split and Mattie
herself slogs through the grief over her marriage's demise and her
father's death. Slowly, though, as the house is repaired and the
hidden dirt on Mattie's father is revealed, a kind of healing begins.</TE>
<TE>   Lamott narrates this tale with her trademark dark wit, making
light of that which is most painful. When frustrated that her
mother's dementia never manifests itself at the doctor's office,
where help is available, Mattie complains to her brother: "With [the
doctor] she's totally lucid, and with us, she's like Shirley Temple
on Quaaludes."</TE>
<TE>   The story's pace is so languid that one wonders for a hundred
pages or so what the actual plot is. There's Mattie in the rotting
house, weighted with lethargy and grief, surrounded by an overflowing
cast of minor characters. They offer Mattie a foil for her humorous
voice but little in the way of forward momentum. Everyone seems
depressed. The house's deterioration fails to resonate as a metaphor
since Mattie isn't attached to it; she is only glad to be staying
there rent free. In other words, the novel in many places is a lot
like life -- as messy, aimless and at-times ordinary as reality tends
to be -- and not the bigger-than-life experience we look to fiction
to provide.</TE>
<TE>   Once Lamott focuses on Mattie's family, however, things get
moving. "The game had been to keep from knowing what you knew -- and
certainly never to say what might be true," Mattie realizes of her
family two-thirds of the way through. "If you let even a trickle in,
it might wash you away. The game was to hope that everyone else would
agree not to know what they knew too."</TE>
<TE>   When Mattie and her brother start to piece together the mysteries
surrounding their father, the pace quickens and the reader is
rewarded for having stuck through all those tedious fix-up projects.
Ultimately, the story grabs hold, but not until the very end.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the portrait of our wounded humanity and the
difficult-yet-enduring aspects of family relations is stirring and
authentic. The book, like the process of clearing away the wreckage
of one's own past, offers only imperfect satisfactions, but in the
long run, it proves worth the effort.</TE>

<LD>Small market: Apart from "Brown Sugar" opening at No. 3, the most
interesting box-office news involved films opening in only a few
theaters. Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love" knocked out a
per-theater average of $73,441 in five sites. "Bowling for Columbine"
also delivered a strike with an average of $26,125 in eight. Then
there was the Madonna bomb: "Swept Away" shortly will be, with a
total of $354,052 in 196 theaters.</LD>

<HD>New to Montana? Get used to the tough life</HD>
<DH>Affluent urban invaders looking for simplicity find the
going bumpy in Big Sky country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOZEMAN, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Eventually, they all call Lee Provence.</LD>
<LD>   Bumping along in his pickup with his black Labrador, Molly,
barking in the flatbed, Provence stared straight ahead, shifted into
four-wheel-drive and reeled off bleak statistics. As road and bridge
superintendent for Gallatin County, he manages 1,100 miles of road
with six plow trucks and a budget of $3.5 million. From that pot, he
also has to pay for equipment repairs and the salaries and benefits
of 32 full-time staffers.</LD>
<LD>   Fixing every road is not an option.</LD>
<TE>   "Neurotic people are moving here," Provence said. "I've had people
call my mother a whore because I wouldn't pave their road."</TE>
<TE>   One irate man called to report that a dirt road near his office
had deteriorated into a dusty washboard and was impassable. Provence
drove down and agreed. He was sympathetic enough to send a crew to
grade the road, cover it with fresh gravel and sprinkle an
inexpensive binder on top of it to hold it all in place.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later the man called with a new complaint. The binder,
he griped, contained red clay that was splattering his otherwise
sparkling SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Gallatin County officials have a strategy to help disgruntled new
arrivals adjust. This month, they spent $8,000 to publish a "Code of
the West" -- a sort of cowboy etiquette guide to bridge the cultural
disconnect. They are not alone. Four other fast-growing counties in
Idaho, Colorado and Montana have resorted to printing pamphlets when
down-home diplomacy failed.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmed in by four mountain ranges and patrolled by bushy-tailed
coyotes too brazen to postpone their rounds until nightfall, Gallatin
County has never been for the faint of heart. This is a place for
people like County Auditor Joyce Schmidt, who wears a .357 magnum to
work, even though that's not in her job description. It's a place for
rancher Jim Kack, who laughs off talk about the full-grown bear that
pressed its wet, black nose against his kitchen window.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few years, new settlers have staked their claims
here, and evidence of their arrival is everywhere, from newspaper
classified ads for housekeepers to secondhand clothing stores stocked
with fine women's slacks.</TE>
<TE>   These new pioneers want country living without sacrificing any of
the amenities of big-city life. But Montana is nothing like the home
they left behind. Montana is about rugged self-sufficiency. To make
it here, one must endure nine-month winters, poor electrical service,
slow emergency response systems and rough back roads that rumble to
abrupt stops a few hundred feet from some homes.</TE>
<TE>   Gallatin's 20-page "Code of the West" will be displayed in the
offices of government workers, real estate agents and home title
agents. The target audience is clear, and the tone is firm, if not
slightly intimidating.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues it addresses: If you call emergency services,
don't expect an immediate response. If you have trash, figure out
where you're supposed to haul it, because there's no curbside pickup.
And if you choose not to build a fence, don't complain if a cow or a
horse tramples your front lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Gallatin County can get as much as 6 feet of snow, so the manual
cautions, "It is not unusual for a county snowplow to block your
driveway with snow during plowing. Remember, it is illegal to remove
snow from your driveway into a county right-of-way. Find another
location to store snow."</TE>
<TE>   It's a straight-shootin' method of dealing with a new kind
of hubris from strangers who want to perform municipal cosmetic surgery
-- a nip here, a tuck there and a smoothing out of every back road.</TE>
<TE>   Kieran Kobell, a retired federal law enforcement agent from New
York, arrived here with his wife in April 1998 and immediately
volunteered at the firehouse and adopted a stretch of highway near
Yellowstone National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as quickly, though, he asked an attorney to look into the
county's obligation to pave some roads near his subdivision in Big
Sky. On a recent morning, Kobell stood ramrod straight in crisp,
clean jeans and a pressed, Wrangler, snap-button cowboy shirt and
admitted he's a bit defensive about his reputation as a
rabble-rouser.</TE>
<TE>   "People say here, 'This is the way it's been done for 20 years,' "
Kobell said. "My response is, 'It's not 20 years ago. Get with the
time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Zane Grey first wrote of the "Code of the West" in 1934,
outlining neighborly rules laid down by settlers for their fellow
"cowmen." The common-sense concept inspired John Clarke, a
commissioner of Larimer County, a fast-growing agricultural region
along Colorado's northern border.</TE>
<TE>   Larimer's population grew by more than 35% during the 1990s, and
Clarke said he could hear the urban sprawl through his phone. He
nearly lost it one day, after a man who had just purchased a home
next to a dairy farm called to complain about the pungent smell
wafting through his windows.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the gentrification of the West," Clarke said. "People
moving here don't make their living from the land."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Clarke penned the first contemporary "Code of the West,"
and within months Gunnison County to the west, an area with a similar
growth rate, published its own version.</TE>
<TE>   In Idaho, Canyon County officials had watched developers mow down
crops of soybeans, sugar beets and hops for acres of housing to
accommodate thousands of new residents. This summer, they used a
state Farm Bureau grant to publish their own "Code of the West."</TE>
<TE>   And with out-of-staters moving steadily to the western part of
Montana, officials in Beaverhead and Madison counties, west of
Gallatin, printed a "Code of the West" two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gallatin County is the most recent to address some of its newest
residents with literature. During the last decade it grew by nearly
35%, to about 70,000 people. The renovated ski resort in Big Sky and
a good airport in Bozeman attracted retirees and "those
Californians," who bumped the median income by more than $6,000 above
the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'We want isolation -- we want to get away from it
all,' " said Penny Bertelsen, a former schoolteacher who runs Bozeman
Realty out of the home where she was born and raised. "I have to ask
if they really understand what 'remote' means. It means, for example,
digging your own septic tank."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 25 homes she sold last year, 18 went to buyers from outside
Montana who were relocating or investing in a second residence. A
look at land use permits in Big Sky in recent years shows owners who
list their permanent residences in states including Arizona,
Michigan, Texas, Rhode Island and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe the growth is Bozeman's fault, says Gallatin's director
of planning, Jennifer Madgic. This charming county seat is decked out
with tony art galleries, Home Depot and specialty coffeehouses,
giving the false impression that rural living can be quilted with
urban culture.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of deceptive," Madgic said. "We have a Victoria's
Secret, but we also have snow on the Fourth of July, and we have
grizzly bears."</TE>
<TE>   Gallatin's "Code of the West" should come in handy in the coming
weeks, as more buyers sneak in their last vacation of the year and
plunk down money on homes. But if they think they'll find their piece
of paradise in this corner of Montana, the code will do its best to
ruin their fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "Often newcomers are much more romantic about the West than the
old-timers and have false hopes about bringing their urban lifestyles
into the great outdoors," the guide reads. "They come with false
expectations. They believe they can fax and e-mail from the
mountaintop. In the New West, the information superhighway is often a
dirt road."</TE>

<LD>Aware that Americans' perception of war gets fuzzier with each
generation, the Marines and Navy have joined forces for the first
time to produce a polished four-minute, 48-second movie trailer full
of Hollywood-style scenes and sound bites from the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Until the trailer debuted last month at theaters in Southern
California, New York and Denver, moviegoers had not seen a rah-rah
military booster film since World War II.</LD>
<LD>   "Enduring Freedom: The Opening Chapter" cost the military $1.2
million to make. The high-quality mini-movie is designed to bolster
civilian support for the armed forces.</LD>
<TE>   "The piece doesn't ask anyone to make a judgment or take an
action," said the trailer's creator, Lt. Col. James Kuhn. "It's just
saying, you're a taxpayer, here's a meaningful look at the military."</TE>
<TE>   Regal Entertainment Group, which as the nation's largest theater
chain owns a quarter of the screens in the country, now is showing
the trailer on 800 of them. A company spokeswoman said that it has
received some complaints but that it is getting mostly favorable
reviews.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday morning, the company issued a statement that read, in
part: "The first year of the war against terrorism has required the
great sacrifice of many men, women and their families. Regrettably,
the American public's recognition of the accomplishments and
sacrifices of these young patriots has been short-lived. It was our
intent to inform and educate the public with this film. It is not
intended to be propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   The images are proving disturbing to some, however. One moviegoer,
Lori Yonan, 39, a publicist for the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts, was settling in with her young daughters for a
Sunday matinee of "Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie," a G-rated children's
movie, when the trailer aired.</TE>
<TE>   "My girls are 4 and 7, and when that trailer came on, they saw the
World Trade Center twin towers crashing down on Sept. 11," she said.
"This was before a G-rated movie, targeting kids younger than 7
years. It's a bunch of vegetables telling Bible stories."</TE>
<TE>   "Enduring Freedom," which is also the name of the Pentagon's
campaign against terrorism, could play on all of Regal's 4,000
screens by the end of next year. This week, the military is awaiting
opinion poll results from theatergoers who saw the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   For Regal, "Enduring Freedom" is a patriotic rollout of its new
$65-million digital network, which the company aims to implement
nationwide by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The digital network enables Regal to download advertisements and
trailers from a satellite on an individual screen basis. The
technology made it attractive to the military because it avoided the
distribution costs of a traditional reel.</TE>
<TE>   It offers a business upside for the chain too. "The ads we show
now have not been really satisfying for us, financially," said Lauren
Leff, Regal's vice president of communications. "We have static
slides or commercials they made for television that they are
transferring to a 40-foot screen."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to playing before some children's flicks, "Enduring
Freedom" has been shown before films that include "The Four Feathers"
and "Sweet Home Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   The trailer was made by American Rogue Film in Santa Monica, which
took studio-based cameras and modified them into hand-held equipment
to take on location and into battle.</TE>
<TE>   "We trained 12 cameramen from [the] Marines and Navy and picked
four of them. They had to have good eyes and be technicians. We had
to feel secure that if one of these cameras broke on a carrier, they
could fix it," said Lance O'Connor, owner of American Rogue Film and
one of the trailer's producers.</TE>
<TE>   The camera crews went with two anti-terrorist squads onto the
Indian Ocean and into Kabul, Afghanistan. They also shot off Hawaii;
at Twentynine Palms; Yuma, Ariz.; and at bases in Norfolk, Va.</TE>
<TE>   After several months, they had 250 hours of footage; the leftovers
will be crafted into recruiting commercials and DVDs. The technology,
O'Connor said, was superior to anything his company has done for the
military in 10 years of advertising campaigns. For starters, Raytheon
designed infrared lenses to put on the cameras, so footage of U.S.
troops taking over Kandahar, Afghanistan, at night enables glimpses
of what O'Connor described as "real Taliban in there."</TE>

<HD>Clarinetist's fusions prove liberating for klezmer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How does a musician reconcile the deep yearnings for one's genetic
roots with a determination to remain curious about the world outside?
Clarinetist David Krakauer continues to find a way.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the Yiddishkayt Los Angeles Festival, Krakauer took his
Klezmer Madness! band into the hip labyrinth of the Knitting Factory
Hollywood on Friday night -- an act that itself was a statement of
liberation -- trying to stretch the boundaries of klezmer.
Encouragingly -- and to the delight of those who came for more than
the usual leaping, yelping wedding dances -- Krakauer's best shots
were those that invigorated the old music with strong injections of
avant-garde jazz, R&amp;B, hip-hop and other dangerous viruses.</LD>
<LD>   Take "Klezmer a la Bechet," the high point of the set, in which
Krakauer's teasing clarinet captured the essences of klezmer and funk
styles over Sheryl Bailey's percolating wah-wah electric guitar,
Nicki Parrott's very funky stand-up electric bass, Rob Curto's nearly
camouflaged accordion and Tony Lewis' second-line New Orleans beat on
drums.</LD>
<TE>   Or how about the acid-jazz groove that ran through "Tribe No. 13,"
the high-pitched, John Coltrane-drenched clarinet trills from the
opening medley of dance tunes and the droning, wailing jazz freakout
that formed the climax of "The New Year After" (inspired by Sept.
11), featuring a guest shofar player from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most self-defining moment came when Krakauer reached
back to his American baby boomer roots for themes from ultra-familiar
TV theme songs like "Leave It to Beaver" and "The Munsters."</TE>
<TE>   We have found an honest man, one who dares to use everything, even
the guiltiest pleasures.</TE>

<LD>Haley Joel Osment has put together a pretty impressive string of
recent films. He got an Oscar nomination for his role in the
blockbuster "The Sixth Sense"; co-starred opposite Jude Law in Steven
Spielberg's "A.I: Artificial Intelligence"; and appeared with Kevin
Spacey in the drama "Pay It Forward." But the movie the young actor
really put his heart into is a movie that you may never see.</LD>
<LD>   Called "Edges of the Lord," it features Osment as a blond,
blue-eyed Jewish boy who is given a chance to survive by passing as a
Gentile during the Nazi invasion of Poland. The film, which co-stars
Willem Dafoe -- no slouch himself when it comes to appearing in
high-visibility films -- as a Polish priest, was acquired by Miramax
Films two years ago and has been sitting on the shelf ever since.</LD>
<LD>   Having his film go unseen has been a rude jolt for Osment. His
father, Eugene Osment, says he and his son are disappointed. "We're
trying to understand -- why isn't this in the theaters?" asks the
elder Osment. "It was a difficult movie to make, but it's even more
painful now because the movie isn't out there for other people to
see."</LD>
<TE>   "Edges of the Lord" isn't alone. Every year, Hollywood studios
quietly dump movies -- even ones with top stars -- that aren't worth
the money to distribute in theaters. Call it Hollywood's dirty little
secret. With marketing costs spiraling higher every year, studios
increasingly have both economic and psychological incentives to cut
their losses by keeping their stinkers in the closet.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Stallone is the star of "D-Tox," a $60-million crime
drama from Universal Pictures that was filmed in early 1999 and has
never been seen in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Al Pacino plays a press agent in "People I Know," a film Miramax
bought 18 months ago and has never released.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax has a cupboard full of orphaned movies. "Daddy and Them,"
a Billy Bob Thornton film that starred Thornton, Laura Dern, Diane
Ladd and Andy Griffith, was recently sold to Showtime after sitting
on the shelf for several years. Michael Caine stars in "Shiner," a
boxing drama that Miramax acquired in February 2001 and has just
released on home video without a U.S. theatrical run.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax is also the distributor of "The Third Wheel," a romantic
comedy that features Luke Wilson, Ben Affleck and Denise Richards.
Shot in 1999, the film has been on the studio's release schedule for
two years without ever coming out.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to face the fact that some movies are better
off on TV or DVD than in a theater," explains Miramax Films co-chief
Harvey Weinstein. "You're asking a lot of an audience to pay nearly
$10 to see a movie, so you don't want them to feel cheated."</TE>
<TE>   Most of these movies never see the light of day for an
all-too-obvious reason: They're awful. In its review of "D-Tox,"
which was released overseas earlier this year, Variety called the
film "almost totally merit-free." One Internet review of a "Third
Wheel" test screening called it "a laugh-free comedy," saying Wilson
was "excruciating to watch" in the lead role. Even Weinstein admits
that "The Third Wheel" would be better off as a video release. But
since Affleck and Matt Damon, who have close ties with Miramax,
produced the film, Weinstein says he'll let them make the final call.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to Ben," says Weinstein. "He's going to run the company
someday anyway, so I have to be nice to him."</TE>
<TE>   Studios, of course, put out bad movies all the time. Just ask
anyone unlucky enough to have sat through such recent Warner Bros.
releases as "FearDotCom" and "The Adventures of Pluto Nash," a film
that sat on the shelf for years before reaching theaters. But Warners
has a big incentive: Many of its movies, including "FearDotCom" are
financed by other companies, which also often pay for the film's
marketing expenses.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you have a film that needs to reach a discerning adult
audience, reviews count. Miramax had been giving the cold shoulder to
another Caine film, "The Quiet American," until the film got a rave
review in Variety when it played the Toronto Film Festival. Barely a
month earlier, Miramax had been shopping the film, hoping another
distributor would take it. Now the studio has given it a November
release date and is pushing Caine for an Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   So why is this film getting a theatrical release and "Edges of the
Lord" is still buried in the vault? "If the critics would champion
'Edges of the Lord' the way they've supported 'Quiet American,' we'd
love to put it out," says Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax competitors say other factors are at work. Miramax is one
of the few remaining studios that's run like a personal fiefdom. When
it comes to acquiring and marketing films, Weinstein is involved in
virtually every major decision. Unlike most of today's studio chiefs,
who are often influenced by corporate concerns, Weinstein still
operates on gut instinct. If he is passionate about a movie, it gets
the studio's unstinting support. If he is unmoved, the film is often
neglected.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein has also spent considerable energy in recent years
pursuing more ambitious projects. Producers of smaller films often
find it harder to get his attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Harvey has lost interest in those little quality films,"
says "Edges of the Lord" producer Zev Braun. "It seems that he's
going after more commercial movies that are a lot easier to market
and sell."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Standing behind his brand</TE>
<TE>   Miramax is one of the only studios, besides its parent company,
Walt Disney Studios, whose brand has a strong identity in the
marketplace. So, Weinstein is especially cautious when it comes to
releasing a film that might tarnish a brand that has come to stand
for quality filmmaking. Still, if a studio knows that it has a
stinker on its hands, why keep it on the shelf for years when it
could at least get some return on its investment by selling it to pay
TV or putting it out on home video?</TE>
<TE>   One reason is financial. As long as the film hasn't been released,
the studio can keep it on its books as an asset. The minute the film
comes out -- and fails to deliver at the box office -- the studio
must write it off as a loss. So, most companies wait as long as
possible before taking a write-off, often delaying the decision until
they can hide the loss among several big hits.</TE>
<TE>   Psychological issues also come into play. Studio chiefs are human
-- they prefer to avoid dwelling on any unpleasant reminder of
failure. "When you know you have a dog, you're in no rush to deal
with it," explains one top executive. "It's like remembering a bad
love affair. You just want to sweep it under the rug."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, films are stuck in limbo because they deal with
untimely subjects. Miramax has delayed releasing "Buffalo Soldiers,"
a critically praised film that it bought in Toronto just days before
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, because the movie -- based on
real-life events occurring at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall
-- portrays the American military in a negative light. When the
studio screened the film shortly after the terror attacks, a test
audience hammered it.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax has delayed its release, waiting for emotions to cool. The
studio plans to put it in theaters next spring, although a war with
Iraq could postpone its arrival again. Not every film has been
permanently damaged by sitting on the shelf. New Line's "new"
gangster comedy, "Knockaround Guys," was shot in the fall of 1999 but
wasn't released until earlier this month. However, in the three years
since it was filmed, its team of young actors, who include Vin
Diesel, Barry Pepper and Seth Green, have become recognizable names,
especially Diesel, who has starred in two megahit films. As New Line
marketing chief Russell Schwartz put it: " 'Knockaround Guys' and its
stars have improved with age, like wine or a good cheese."</TE>
<TE>   But few on-the-shelf movies get a second chance. Millenium Films
chief Avi Lerner, who bankrolled "Edges of the Lord" and "The Grey
Zone," another Holocaust drama that is now being shown in theaters,
thinks Miramax is selling it short. He believes "Edges" would be less
difficult to market than "The Grey Zone," a portrait of the Jews at
Auschwitz who cooperated with their Nazi guards.</TE>
<TE>   "I like both movies," he says. "But 'Grey Zone' is much more dark
and horrifying. At least 'Edges' has a happy ending. In my opinion,
this is a unique movie people should see in a theater. And that's
what is sad -- right now, no one can see it at all."</TE>

<LD>Here's a look at some recent films that have been stranded on the
shelf.</LD>
<LD>   "D-Tox." Shot in 1999, this Sylvester Stallone cop thriller was
such a disaster that producer Imagine Entertainment took its name off
the film. Universal Pictures shot a new ending, but the picture still
tested terribly. The film opened overseas earlier this year, but it
did little business. It debuts on video Nov. 30.</LD>
<LD>   "Daddy and Them." Written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton in
1998, this drama about the effect of a murder on an Arkansas family
featured a host of name actors, including his former girlfriend Laura
Dern and her mom, Diane Ladd. Originally scheduled for release by
Miramax in 1999, the film was repeatedly delayed until the studio
announced it would debut later this year on Showtime.</LD>
<TE>   "Unconditional Love." Directed by P.J. Hogan ("My Best Friend's
Wedding"), this comedy stars Rupert Everett and Kathy Bates as a
British valet and a housewife who unite to avenge the death of a
mutual love interest. New Line plans to release the film, shot in
1999, on home video next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "People I Know." The film stars Al Pacino as a New York press
agent whose top client (Ryan O'Neal) becomes embroiled in a scandal
that jeopardizes his plans to run for the Senate. Miramax has tried
without success to sell it to rival companies, but it says it still
could get a limited release before going to pay TV and home video.</TE>
<TE>   "Killing Me Softly." Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes co-star in
an MGM erotic thriller by acclaimed Chinese director Kaige Chen
("Farewell My Concubine"). After bombing with test audiences -- one
Internet reviewer called it "two hours of torture" -- the film is
still shelved.</TE>
<TE>   "Highway." Despite the presence of young hotties like Jake
Gyllenhaal, Jared Leto and Selma Blair, this black comedy bombed at
test screenings. Sensing disaster, New Line never gave it a
theatrical release. The film was put out on home video in March.</TE>
<TE>   "The Third Wheel." Even with a cast including Ben Affleck, Luke
Wilson and Denise Richards, this quirky comedy never worked with
audiences. Filmed in 1999, it's still on the shelf at Miramax and
will probably go direct to video.</TE>
<TE>   "Double Whammy." Directed by Tom DiCillo and starring Dennis Leary
and Elizabeth Hurley, the film did poorly at test screenings and got
awful reviews -- the London Daily Mail said the film made "Bad Boy,"
another Leary and Hurley bomb, "look like 'Citizen Kane.' " Lions
Gate is putting it out on home video in December.</TE>
<TE>   "House of 1000 Corpses." This Rob Zombie-directed horror film was
made by Universal Pictures but was dropped after studio executives
became uncomfortable with the film's explicit violence. MGM execs
were on the verge of picking it up when studio chief Kirk Kerkorian
ordered them to back out of the deal. Lions Gate now has the film and
plans to release it next spring.</TE>

<HD>CBS turns to quartet in a.m.</HD>
<DH>The network, long stuck in last place in the morning show
ratings, promises an energized show and hosts with something to say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- CBS News will attempt its newest incarnation of a morning
show beginning Oct. 28, and to those who would ask why the perennial
third-place program bothers, there is a simple answer: money.</LD>
<LD>   With morning television stakes high, CBS can't afford to give up,
so the network will try again with an ensemble group on "The Early
Show," made up of "Biography" host and former "CBS This Morning"
co-anchor Harry Smith, NBC sports anchor Hannah Storm, current news
anchor Julie Chen and a newcomer to network television, Dallas TV
anchor Rene Syler.</LD>
<LD>   Traditional anchor roles and national weather will be missing.
Each member of the ensemble will do interviews and introduce reports
from CBS correspondents; weather forecasts will be ceded to local
stations. The foursome will frequently comment, in a group
discussion, on the news and stories of the day.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to try to bring more energy to the show and more
spontaneity to the morning," said Michael Bass, the show's senior
executive producer, calling the show an alternative to the "clones"
that the current ABC, NBC and CBS shows have been. "These people all
have a lot to say and it's important to let them say it."</TE>
<TE>   But with morning audiences resistant to change, CBS executives
have to walk a fine line of trying to distinguish the show from
rivals without jarring the small audience that currently tunes in.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bass and CBS News President Andrew Heyward insisted the show
will still look and feel like morning television, with the same mix
of news, information and entertainment that viewers expect. "We're
not reinventing the wheel here," Heyward said.</TE>
<TE>   CBS has had little success in the last three decades finding a
morning format that could challenge NBC's "Today" show and ABC's
"Good Morning America," yet the network has no choice but to keep
trying, Heyward said.</TE>
<TE>   There is enormous potential revenue, the program helps CBS spread
news gathering costs across many time periods and the audience is
growing, he said, making the morning, "in terms of the continuing
prosperity of the news division, critically important."</TE>
<TE>   "We've made progress even while being a distant third," Heyward
said of the most recent version of the show, anchored by Bryant
Gumbel and Jane Clayson. Heyward declined to discuss profit numbers,
but they are said to be in the tens of millions of dollars. He said a
morning program also "sets the tone for the day" for both viewers and
the news division itself. "This is arguably the most important day
part in television news right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will have newly energized competition. "Good Morning America"
is riding high on gains made in the past year, while "Today," still a
very comfortable leader in the morning, is getting a new executive
producer.</TE>
<TE>   For Smith, who co-anchored "CBS This Morning" from 1987 to 1996,
the return to mornings is somewhat of a vindication, after being
pushed out the last time around. He says that word "hasn't been part
of the vocabulary." He'll continue to anchor "Biography" on A&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   Storm, 40, has been an anchor and reporter with NBC Sports for 10
years, hosting Olympics and NBA coverage, among other events. Chen,
32, has been the news anchor of "The Early Show" since it debuted in
1999 and also hosted the summer reality series "Big Brother."</TE>
<TE>   Syler, who is 39 and grew up in Sacramento, has anchored newscasts
at CBS-owned KTVT in Dallas since 1997 and anchored at Dallas' WFAA
from 1992 to 1997; before that, she worked at a number of local
stations around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, KCBS said it too has a new morning anchor, Suzanne
Rico, who will join Kent Shocknek on the 5 to 7 a.m. "CBS 2 News This
Morning," beginning Oct. 23. Rico, who replaces Catherine Anaya, was
previously an anchor and reporter for San Diego's KNSD.</TE>

<LD>WHAT IS A SYMPHONY?</LD>
<LD>   Have you started reading chapter books yet? If so, maybe you like
to pause a bit before starting a new chapter. This gives you a chance
to think about what you've just read. A new chapter also signals that
there may be a shift, or change, in the story. Perhaps a new
character or theme will be introduced.</LD>
<LD>   A symphony -- which is a piece of music composed, or written, for
an orchestra -- is similar to a chapter book. But instead of having
chapters, it is divided into sections of notes that are called
"movements." These movements are played with short pauses between
them. Symphonies generally have three or four movements.</LD>
<TE>   Like chapters in a book, the tempo, or rhythm, changes with each
movement. For example, the first movement may be very fast, followed
by a slow movement and then by a "dancing" one.</TE>
<TE>   The key, or tone, can change with each movement as well. A
movement in a minor key can sound mournful or sad, while a major-key
movement might sound heroic and uplifting.</TE>
<TE>   When the orchestra pauses between movements, it helps both the
audience and the musicians prepare to go in a different musical
direction.</TE>
<TE>   The final movement always briefly repeats the music from all of
the earlier movements, helping to unify, or join together, the entire
piece of music.</TE>
<TE>   The American Youth Symphony will perform two well-known symphonies
at a free concert on Oct. 27 at UCLA. The concert begins at 8 p.m.

<HD>A very independent streak</HD>
<DH>The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive presents a three-week
festival celebrating the strong-willed acting and directing of Ida
Lupino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting in such films as "Out of the Fog" (1941), "The Sea Wolf"
(1941), "High Sierra" (1941) and "Road House" (1948), Ida Lupino
became a role model for future generations of actresses playing
tough, independent women. But it was as a director that Lupino blazed
new trails, becoming the only notable female filmmaker of her era in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Bristling under the Hollywood studio system, she and her
then-husband, Collier Young, set up an independent production
company, Filmmakers, at RKO Studios in the late '40s. Over the next
few years, Lupino directed and co-produced -- and in some cases wrote
-- six low-budget B films that explored such socially conscious
topics as unwed motherhood ("Not Wanted"), rape ("Outrage") and
bigamy ("The Bigamist"). (Elmer Clifton is listed as director of the
1949 film "Not Wanted." But he took ill three days into the
production; Lupino directed the film uncredited.)</LD>
<LD>   "She was electric," says Sally Forrest, whom Lupino discovered and
directed in three films, including "Not Wanted." "She never had the
popularity she should have had. She was a fine actress. She was
beautiful. She had a fabulous figure and was a great director. Maybe
she was too strong for those days."</LD>
<TE>   As an actress, Lupino often got roles that were turned down by
another tough gal, Bette Davis -- but if it weren't for Davis, the
UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive probably wouldn't be celebrating
Lupino's acting and directing career with a three-week tribute that
begins Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1940s, the lithe British actress with the big brown
eyes was under contract to Warner Bros., where she always played
second fiddle to Davis, the studio's grande dame.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave Bette Davis first choice of all the parts Ida wanted,"
recalls actress Mala Powers, who starred in the Lupino-directed
"Outrage" in 1950. "Then they would hand something to Ida she didn't
want to play. So she would take a suspension -- she couldn't work
anywhere else during suspension, so she would go on the sets of
movies. Most of the directors knew her and liked her, and she'd watch
them direct."</TE>
<TE>   And she would tell the directors she wanted to learn the craft.
"She'd say, 'Chum, I'd really like to learn about all of this.' So
she'd sit there and watch. And the cameraman would say, 'Come over
and look at this' -- this is what the shot would be. So she learned
to direct on her suspension times. I often wondered what my destiny
would have been had I never met her."</TE>
<TE>   For UCLA's Andrea Alsberg, curator of the film festival, Lupino is
"just an amazing figure both for her acting and for the direction of
these films that sort of came out of nowhere. There is nothing else
like them. When did you see a film about rape or bigamy? She took on
these challenging social dramas."</TE>
<TE>   Alsberg acknowledges these films may seem a bit tame now, but they
were quite brave in their day because of what Lupino had to do "with
the censorship board and Howard Hughes [who owned RKO] and anybody
else who was involved in green-lighting the films."</TE>
<TE>   Lupino stated when she began her company that she wanted to make
films that were about something -- "not about faces or stars,"
Alsberg says. "I think Sally Forrest and Mala Powers are interesting
figures because they are her stand-ins. They really do resemble her
in a way. She said she cast actresses for two reasons -- personality
and large eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Born in London in 1918, Lupino was from a famous family of
entertainers that could be traced back to the 17th century. At 13,
she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and made her film
debut. At 14, she got her first starring role in "Her First Affaire."
The following year she came to Hollywood, where she appeared in a
series of forgettable films at Paramount, usually in the ingenue
role.</TE>
<TE>   Her big break came in 1939 when she appeared opposite Ronald
Colman in William Wellman's "The Light That Failed" as an embittered
streetwalker called Bessie Broke. Warner Bros. was so impressed with
her turn that they gave her a contract. While at the studio, she
built a reputation for professionalism and intelligence. "I think,
ultimately, directors preferred her over Bette Davis," Alsberg says.
"She was a star, but without the star's attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest and Powers say that Lupino was an exceptional director.
"She was so knowledgeable in every area," Forrest says. "She was
wonderful with actors. She was the best I ever worked with. She was
completely understanding and knew exactly what she wanted and how to
explain it."</TE>
<TE>   Powers, who is the co-executor of Lupino's estate -- the actress
died in 1995 -- says that as a director she was very protective of
her performers, "so you dared to be wrong because if you did anything
wrong, she [wouldn't] print it."</TE>
<TE>   Lupino's marriage to Young broke up early into their partnership,
and their company came to an end in the mid-'50s. Lupino then segued
into a successful career as a TV director.</TE>
<TE>   She did direct one last feature, the 1966 Rosalind Russell-Hayley
Mills comedy "The Trouble With Angels," about two unruly teenagers
sent to a convent school. "It's very different from the other films,"
Alsberg says. But, she adds, Mills' character is just as much an
outsider as Forrest's in "Not Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Noted Alsberg: "I think that her interest was in exploring the
lost, the disenfranchised and the outsiders, and that continued all
the way through her career."</TE>

<LD>If Pearl Jam's gritty, intense rock comes off as a little too serious
sometimes, fans can turn to PJ guitarist Stone Gossard's lighter,
looser side project, Brad. At the Roxy on Sunday, the Seattle band's
laid-back set of heartfelt ballads and melodic roots-rock was often
too mellow for its own good.</LD>
<LD>   Gossard was fairly inconspicuous, staying in the background while
bassist Jeremy Toback and drummer Regan Hagar fell into sometimes
monotonous grooves. Though Gossard's skilled guitar work gives Brad's
music its texture and intricacy, it was singer Shawn Smith who
fortified each tune onstage.</LD>
<LD>   Sounding like a melding of Blues Traveler's John Popper and Dave
Matthews at his most soulful, Smith's impassioned singing gave even
the band's sluggish songs a lift and added fire to the superior funky
grinds.</LD>
<TE>   The packed house was unabashedly devoted, singing along, dancing
and often exuding more enthusiasm than the band itself. Despite their
subdued stance, Brad still managed to create a blissful atmosphere,
and felt more like a jamming band of friends than a rock-star vanity
project.</TE>

<LD>It's all about sex: the music, the costumes and the movement. That's
the overriding impression that the ebullient, indefatigable National
Ballet of Senegal gave when its 30-person company presented
"Kuuyamba" Sunday at El Camino College's Marsee Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   The two-hours-plus work tracks the transition from adolescence to
adulthood through the music, song and dance of Senegal's many ethnic
groups.</LD>
<LD>   With 11 percussionists creating a kind of pumped-up surround sound
(there were also several xylophone-type instruments and the wondrous
plucked strings of a kora), the dancers vamped in number after
number. Whether madly spinning across the floor in pumpkin-colored
grass skirts or leaping like gazelles in poufs of brilliantly hued
pantaloons, they had it going on.</LD>
<TE>   Choreographed by Bouly Sonko, even the simplest things -- doing
chores like floor-sweeping or water-drawing -- became cause for
celebration. Long legs, pliant backs and frenzied footwork punctuated
most of the scenes, with acrobatics tossed off with ease. Indeed,
one-armed cartwheels, manic tumbling and unfettered bouts of break
dancing proved so infectious that several audience members were
compelled to go onstage and shimmy themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The group benefited, too, from lush lighting and many costume
changes. This troupe is the personification of joy and life itself --
a heady elixir for a troubled world.</TE>

<LD>Kubla Khan might have been deterred by the razor wire, but Angelenos
are made of sterner stuff. They might blink a bit at the
sun-scorched, unabashed ugliness of Bellaire Avenue in North
Hollywood. Good Lord, where are we? They might check the address they
scrawled on a bit of paper a few days ago as they leaned against
their old, worn, positively ghastly kitchen counters. Is this right?
But, reassured by the numbers, they drive gamely on, past the
prison-camp fences, past the storage units and warehouses, the
parking lots shivering in the sun.</LD>
<LD>   They pull their Expeditions and Escalades, their Jags and BMWs,
their Hummers along curbs so dusty it's impossible to tell if they
are red, behind other cars that don't have windows, that seem held
together by duct tape. Honey, stop looking for the valet and just
park. The sky is stretched white and the railroad tracks are within
spitting distance, but the people get out of their cars and leave
them, trailed by the staccato boop-boop of alarm systems being
double-, triple-checked. They are far from their homes, they are
propelled by need, by desire. They know this is the kind of place you
must endure if you want to get the really good stuff.</LD>
<LD>   They are here to choose their granite.</LD>
<TE>   In the past few years, it has become an L.A. pilgrimage -- the
trip to the granite yard. Thanks to the can-do mentality of shelter
magazines and HGTV, no kitchen is safe from the granite-counter
remodel, no bathroom too small for a double-headed shower lined in
Vermont verde. In the last five years, granite has become the stone
fox of interior designers, contractors and Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Xanadu's sunny dome and caves of ice didn't choose themselves, you
know.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Brazil Granite on Bellaire, customers sit at tables in the
showroom, running their fingers over samples, exposing their lust,
here where it's safe, giving it dimension and specifics -- the
bathroom, the kitchen countertops, the entire entry way. Others
wander into the yard to survey the harvested hearts of the world's
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for granite has increased so much that quarriers in
Italy, Brazil, India and China are constantly digging into new
hillsides, hoping to find a different color or pattern. From deepest
onyx to garnet-flecked gold, from the black and gray freckles seen in
law offices to the swirling lapis of Brazilian Blue Bahia (at more
than $110 a square foot, the most expensive granite in the world),
the slabs are gorgeous. It is impossible not to touch them, and
everywhere hands are stretched out, surfaces stroked; one woman lays
her cheek against a deep green. It is cool and mysterious even in
this sun-blasted place.</TE>
<TE>   The slabs are not just stone; they are tapestry. Each is unique,
and in the world of shelter-chic, it is imperative to be unique. That
is why the people are here.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Joss has been in the granite business for 22 years, seen it
increase tenfold. Prices have come down, he says, while desire, and
the belief that desire should be satiated, has risen. "It used to be
just the high, high-end houses," he says, "Bel-Air. Beverly Hills.
But just the other day, we did a house in Inglewood. We haven't done
one in South-Central yet, but I'm sure we will."</TE>
<TE>   Joss is a Brit and looks it, with the portly figure and amiable
knowing face of a publican. He turns a customer over to his son
Lawrence, who owns Brazil Granite. Lawrence Joss is tall and slim. He
grew up surrounded by stone. He is 33 and wears glasses with bright
green frames and many bracelets. He could easily be a gallery owner
in Echo Park or on Melrose Avenue; instead he owns three granite and
marble distributorships and several ceramic and tile stores. Instead,
he is an avatar of the New Stone Age.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Getting smarter, pickier</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, contractors were the only ones who walked through
these halls of stone. Clients picked from a sample board. But granite
is a naturally occurring substance -- the result of magma cooling at
great depth. Often, its patterns, and even the shifting hues of the
stone, cannot be fairly represented by a coaster-sized sample. And as
homeowners became more educated, they became more particular.</TE>
<TE>   Ezra Chowaiki, a local contractor, remembers a man who chose a
rose-green granite. When the fabricator cut the granite, the piece
for the kitchen island happened to be much more rose than green. "We
had to rip it all out," says Chowaiki, flatly. "Now I send my
customers to the yard."</TE>
<TE>   The quest for granite is usually a two-stop journey. After the
slabs have been chosen, most clients make their way to a
fabricator-installer like Brewster Marble Co. in San Fernando, where
the chosen slabs will be cut and finished before installation.</TE>
<TE>   Brewster Marble is owned by Teo Zeolla, who also grew up in the
business. Zeolla's father and uncle opened one of the first stone
yards in L.A. They did much of the stonework in Century City and in
Las Vegas; they cut the marble for Caesar's Palace.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, in the concrete yard, it's difficult to imagine that
these dusty, jagged slabs will become the gleaming counters and
foyers of the shelter-obsessed. Some customers will visit their slabs
before they are cut, outlining their sinks and sideboards.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the shop, the noise is just bearable, and heady ribbons of
acetate lattice the air.</TE>
<TE>   Walking among the polished pieces, it is clear there is no single
color of money. Or desire. For all its domestic virtues, granite
seems a bit more casino lobby than grandma's kitchen. This is not
about rolling pie crusts or putting up jam. This is about power,
about tramping through the chalky dust of the granite yard, choosing
stone as one imagines the emperors once did.</TE>

<DH>Legendary architectural photographer Julius Shulman, 92,
captures the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels with his experienced
and precise lens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a beautiful, clear Thursday morning, and Julius Shulman is on
the job. The dean of modern architecture photography, who celebrated
his 92nd birthday on Oct. 10, has an assignment: shooting the
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.Dressed in a brick-red shirt,
brown trousers and suspenders emblazoned with American flags, with
lavender socks peeking out above comfy beige shoes, Shulman may look
like a casual artiste, but he didn't earn his reputation by fooling
around. Starting in the late 1930s, his photographs of homes by
Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler, along with the famed Arts &amp;
Architecture-sponsored Case Study houses, became the signature images
of L.A. modernism. What we have at the cathedral today is a human
legend shooting an architectural icon.</LD>
<LD>   And he leaves nothing to chance. If he has a motto, it must be
"think before you click." Most people "don't notice that if you move
to the right or the left, you might get a better view," he says.
"They just go click, click, click."</LD>
<TE>   During the last few weeks, Shulman has made distinctive pictures
of the Jose Rafael Moneo-designed cathedral, but he has a few more
locations in mind. With his longtime assistant, David Glomb, carrying
his equipment, he glides across the upper plaza, pushing a walker
that he doesn't seem to need. He enters the north door of the
cathedral and heads toward the confessionals, three side-by-side
chambers sheathed in polished wood.</TE>
<TE>   Most people's knowledge of confessionals is limited to images in
films, he says. "We get a glimpse of a sinner in a cage. I want to
show what a confessional looks like, with one room open, one closed
and a person coming in. I want to show how it occupies space in a
cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Shulman is working with a Mamiya camera that produces 2 1/4- by
3-inch transparencies. On earlier cathedral shoots he made 4- by
5-inch transparencies with a Sinar. But "the camera is the
photographer's least important tool," he says. "It's what goes on in
the mind that counts."</TE>
<TE>   Glomb sets up a trial shot, then pulls off a Polaroid print. The
light isn't right and the composition should be tighter, Shulman
says. Glomb moves the tripod-mounted camera closer while Shulman
walks through the middle confessional, opens the back door -- out of
the camera's view -- and props it ajar with a chair. He goes back to
the camera, looks through the viewfinder, then moves the chair to
adjust the light.</TE>
<TE>   A cathedral staffer is guarding one entrance to the confessional
area so that roaming visitors don't spoil Shulman's picture. To
provide the necessary human presence, exactly as he wants it, he has
asked Rose Nielsen, a photographer who has digitized some of his
cathedral pictures, to pose as if she were a parishioner entering the
confessional.</TE>
<TE>   "That's good," Shulman says, looking at a Polaroid image of the
composition. "It's a better composition than I thought it would be."</TE>
<TE>   He gets one or two shots, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony stops by.
They walk to the back of the cathedral, pull up a couple of chairs
near the baptistry and peruse a batch of transparencies and digital
prints.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the Ansel Adams of architecture photography," Mahony says as
he holds the transparencies up to the light. "I would not want him to
see the pictures I've taken of the cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Then Mahony retreats and Shulman goes back to work.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where you get the best perspective of the pews," he says,
setting up his camera near the rear of the north wall of the nave.
"Look how the light hits the top of the pews," he says, pointing out
a rippling effect. "And the light from the alabaster window is OK
too."</TE>
<TE>   In his opinion, the alabaster works particularly well on the north
side of the cathedral, but the window at the front of the church?
Maybe not. "If I were Cardinal Shulman, I would say no to alabaster
on the east wall because it puts too much light in the eyes of the
congregation. There's a reason that many cathedrals have rose
windows."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from that flaw and, even worse, "the barber shop light
fixtures" in the nave, Shulman loves the interior of the cathedral.
"The exterior is too abrasive. It doesn't have the visual acoustics I
look for." But inside, "there's never a dull moment."</TE>
<TE>   And he has had several field days, meticulously composing and
shooting aspects of the interior architecture that others might not
notice. Every so often, he pauses and says, "There's something
magical here," as he sees yet another picture that he wants.</TE>

<HD>'Property' dazzles with its dysfunction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Depression is just reality trying to wake you up." This is one of
numerous zingers dotting Justin Tanner's "Hot Property," playing the
Evidence Room in repertory as part of the Edge of the World Festival.
Writer-director Tanner's first Los Angeles premiere in four years is
generally hilarious and representative of its author's distinctive
voice.</LD>
<LD>   Like many Tanner works, "Property" transpires in present-day Los
Angeles, at the Beachwood Canyon apartment of protagonist Brett (Matt
Huhn). As delineated by Jason Adams and Andy Daley's expertly tacky
poolside setting, many observers may register recognition before the
play even begins.</LD>
<LD>   The premise pits veteran 99-seat theater actor Brett against
drugs, colleagues, the heartless Industry and, above all, his
visiting family, yet another dysfunctional Tanner brood.</LD>
<TE>   They include Brett's born-again bully brother, Chuck (Nick
Offerman), tactlessly optimistic sister, Sissy (longtime Tanner
collaborator Laurel Green), and their smother-mother, the
incongruously named Joy (Jayne Taini).</TE>
<TE>   This cringe-worthy group tenuously supports Brett's career, though
only Sissy wants anyone's autograph. Joy and Chuck are skeptical at
best, their suspicions aroused by Brett's cannabis-reeking kitchen,
which disgorges playwright Jamie (Darin Anthony), his scary
girlfriend, Dory (Alicia Adams), Brett's agent, Hal (Dean Biasucci),
and Slavic-accented Gia (Beata Swiderska). When Brett leaves for a
Canadian TV-movie shoot, his friends stage a blowout as the Act 1
curtain falls.</TE>
<TE>   Act 2 picks up post-shindig, with clean-and-sober Brett's early
return leading to confrontations, first with his cronies and then his
family. The ensuing mayhem culminates in the arrival of Brett's new
amour, Diana (Mara Casey), an Industry hotshot with her own agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Few writers can rival Tanner's insight on this milieu, and his
skill at authentic characterizations and invective remains matchless.
The comments and name-dropping are virtually identical to any average
night at Akbar, and the mid-Act 1 reading of Jamie's terrible
screenplay is sidesplitting. As for the family unit, here is Tanner's
satirical ethos in full facile bloom.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble is delirious, completely attuned to Tanner's writing
and each other. Offerman, his face contorted whether praying or
braying, walks away with every scene. Taini's Joy is hysterical,
uttering lines like, "I always assumed all my children would be
failures" with casually beatific venom. Green has negotiated these
channels before, but Sissy feels newly minted, riotous in her Act 2
outburst.</TE>
<TE>   The slackers are all spot-on, with Adams' post-Goth dourness
particularly apt, while Huhn's struggle to assert himself amid all
this is most endearing.</TE>
<TE>   Casey invests her culture vulture with vivid detailing, although
the character's function in the denouement seems abrupt.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the principal weakness in Tanner's writing, one that his
deliberately rushed direction shares. While his recycling of motifs
(especially from "Intervention") is adroit, the breakneck trajectory
introduces multiple themes without fully developing them.</TE>
<TE>   This does not prevent "Hot Property" from scoring big-time laughs,
but Tanner might take a page from Kaufman &amp; Hart's book and structure
his next farce in the three-act form.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Haunting Golijov work played with devotion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Osvaldo Golijov's large-scale "La Pasion Segun San Marco" won't be
performed locally until this weekend at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center. But one of the Argentine composer's shorter works,
"Yiddishbbuk," whetted interest in his music as it dominated a
bracing four-part program by Cuarteto Latinoamericano on Sunday at
the Irvine Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "Yiddishbbuk" takes its title from a collection of apocryphal
psalms Franz Kafka referenced in a letter. "No one sings as purely as
those who inhabit the deepest hell," Kafka quoted from the
collection. Golijov's 12-minute work has that hell in mind as he
memorializes three children interned by the Nazis at Terezin and
ultimately killed. Isaac Bashevis Singer and Leonard Bernstein are
commemorated in the last two movements.</LD>
<LD>   Spectral harmonics eerily evoke the disembodied presence of the
children amid a haze of emerging klezmer rhythms and textures.
Passages of vital energy and protest fill out this mournful and
haunting memorial, played devotedly by violinists Saul and Aron
Bitran and cellist Alvaro Bitran, who are brothers, and violist
Javier Montiel.</LD>
<TE>   The program also included Heitor Villa-Lobos' challenging Quartet
No. 9, which was so rhythmically and imaginatively engaging that even
first violinist Saul Bitran's breaking his E string shortly after
starting the third movement didn't ruin the momentum. He had to leave
the stage to replace it, and the quartet restarted the movement and
ran the work to its whirlwind conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the program were Astor Piazzolla's "Four for Tango" and
Diego Vega's Cuarteto No. 1, a substitution for Julian Orbon's
Quartet, the score of which had been left behind at an earlier tour
stop, according to a Philharmonic Society spokesperson. The quartet
played Rodolfo Halffter's "Tiento No. 5" as the encore.</TE>

<HD>Bunnies across the border: Playboy's back</HD>
<DH>After a four-year absence, the magazine relaunches its
Mexico edition with fingers crossed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The last time Playboy put out a magazine here, it was embarrassing.
The editors had trouble getting Mexican women to take off their
clothes. A few actresses and models complied, but mostly in coy poses
behind palm fronds or other obstructions. Lorena Herrera, a
television comedy star, hid behind the pseudonym Barbara Ferrat, whom
she later claimed, unconvincingly, was her twin sister.</LD>
<LD>   "The Playboy philosophy was to feature Mexicans -- a mix of
celebrities and the girl next door -- but attitudes toward nudity
made that almost impossible," said Cesar Romero Solis, an editor who
remembers just two Mexicanas in the centerfold during his five years
at the magazine's Mexican edition.</LD>
<LD>   Imported pictorials from the U.S. edition filled the gap, but
readership dwindled from 60,000 to 20,000 before the Mexican Playboy,
hurt by a nationwide financial crash, folded in early 1998 after a
22-year run.</LD>
<TE>   Now Playboy is back. Turning to foreign markets as its status
fades at home, Hugh Hefner's magazine has launched a revised Mexican
edition on the hunch that loosening moral strictures here will free a
new generation of women to vie for exposure on its pages.</TE>
<TE>   That's a bold assumption in a country where Roman Catholicism is
the dominant faith and the family is still a potent moral force.</TE>
<TE>   Equally uncertain is whether advertisers, wary of those pressures,
will support the magazine and whether Mexicans will pay $4 per issue.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises Inc. and its Mexican
partner, Consorcio Sayrols, are bullish on Mexico, with its new
democratic freedoms, recovering economy and strategic position as a
testing ground for the magazine's appeal in Central and South
America.</TE>
<TE>   Before nearly 1,000 guests from Mexico's corporate and
entertainment worlds, Playboy threw a party last week to introduce
the Mexican edition -- its November issue hit newsstands today -- and
to trample on the country's traditional restraints.</TE>
<TE>   As a warmup, three women in nothing but bikini bottoms, go-go
boots and head-to-toe body paint writhed on a runway, clutching
electric razors supplied by a Playboy advertiser. Models paraded fall
fashions. Fireworks exploded, introducing the edition's first cover
girls -- a trio of big-busted singers called Las Chicas Tentacion
(The Temptation Chicks).</TE>
<TE>   In the main event, eight wannabe playmates chosen from 53
respondents to a Mexico City casting call strutted in swimwear and
evening gowns before a jury, which selected four to pose for the
first centerfolds of 2003 and earn $5,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is ready for a magazine like Playboy," said Manuel
Martinez Torres, the Mexican edition's 31-year-old editor. "Our
society is more open, more diverse, more daring. Two years ago voters
dared to get rid of the old ruling party, but it's more than that.
Mexicans are making their own decisions and worrying less what their
parents will say, what the priest will say."</TE>
<TE>   And actresses worry less what the conservative Televisa will say.
The TV network lost its monopoly of the airwaves here in the
mid-1990s, along with much of its control over what performers do off
screen.</TE>
<TE>   The November issue carries a message in Spanish from Hefner saying
that Mexico's recent political and social changes remind him of
Playboy's pioneering years at the dawn of America's sexual
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy executives have distributed 50,000 copies to
newsstands and say advertising has exceeded expectations. Yet publishing
analysts wonder how Playboy can reach its first-year circulation
target of 70,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is awash in the same down-market skin magazines and
Internet porn that contributed to the former Playboy's demise. The
revised Playboy must compete for upscale readers with a new crop of
men's magazines such as British-based Maxim, which features scantily
clad models in a Spanish-language edition.</TE>
<TE>   "Playboy's circulation goals are very optimistic," said Manolo
Barberena of Pearson Intelligence in Marketing and Opinion Research
here. "Only celebrity gossip magazines get that many readers, and
they're aimed at a wider audience."</TE>
<TE>   Playboy's strategy is to combine a slick format modeled on the
U.S. edition with local content geared to the tastes of Mexican men
ages 25 to 45.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico is becoming a cultural crossroads," said Raul Sayrols, one
of two brothers running the company publishing Mexico's Playboy. "You
see the changes in movies and theater, on fashion runways, all over
the place."</TE>
<TE>   The multinational mix of available women here, Sayrols said, suits
Playboy's strategy of expanding the Mexican edition southward next
year. Playboy has 19 foreign editions, which account for more than a
third of its total circulation of about 5 million. It is largely
untested in much of Latin America, although its Brazil edition is
very successful.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's November issue features an interview with Mexican
novelist Carlos Fuentes (Willie Nelson is the interviewee in the U.S.
issue) and an article on Mexican drug lords. Neither exceeds 4 1/2
pages, on the theory that if Mexican men actually read the articles,
they won't want to spend a whole lot of time doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the nudes are gringas, lifted, as in the past, from
Playboy's U.S. edition. But the Mexican editors believe that
home-grown women, the more naked and famous the better, are the key
to boosting circulation and say they are negotiating with eight
celebrities to pose.</TE>
<TE>   Some Mexicans doubt the taboos have fallen enough to permit that.</TE>
<TE>   "No one famous is going to pose for this magazine," predicted
Stephanie Salas, a rebellious actress who appeared in the former
edition. Vanessa Zorrilla, a 28-year-old model picked to be the new
edition's first Mexican playmate, agreed that "the culture is still a
bit closed."</TE>
<TE>   But Zorrilla said her generation of Mexican models and performers
is being pushed to compete with more adventurous young women from
across Latin America who have flooded the market here in recent
years, hoping that growing U.S.-Mexico trade will help them get work
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   About half the 53 women at Playboy's casting call here were from
other Latin American countries. Those chosen for the magazine include
an Argentine model who fled her country's financial meltdown and a
dancer from Cuba's Tropicana club who had defected.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer Liz Vega believes there's a Latino audience. "Playboy has
lots of interesting things, not just naked women," she said. "Fidel
Castro was in it."</TE>

<LD>   British judges rule against model</LD>
<LD>   Three British appeals judges ruled Monday that a London newspaper
was justified in publishing a photo of Naomi Campbell leaving a drug
addiction center, as the model had lied to the media about her drug
problems.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a high court judge ordered the Daily Mirror
tabloid to pay Campbell $5,425 in damages and meet her court costs
after he ruled the newspaper had breached her right to
confidentiality by running the story in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Three judges at the Court of Appeal in London on Monday upheld the
newspaper's appeal. Lord Phillips, England's senior civil judge, said
Campbell had gone out of her way to tell the news media that she,
unlike other models, did not take stimulants or tranquilizers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was untrue. She had, in fact, become addicted to drugs,"
Phillips said. "Where a public figure chooses to make untrue
pronouncements about his, or her, private life, the press will
normally be entitled to put the record straight."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, 32, was not in court Monday but said in a statement,
"The idea that because you deny something about your private life
automatically entitles the media to publish otherwise private
information, seems to me to be very harsh indeed."</TE>

<HD>Fans tip their hats to Pat Green</HD>
<DH>The country singer, who has been known to perform barefoot,
is the real deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas country-rocker Pat Green had to borrow a cowboy hat from a fan
Sunday at the Coach House to sing a song about a guy who's so
attached to his hat that he boasts, "You can take it off me sometime
after I am dead."</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, the hat was maybe three sizes shy of fitting, creating
a cute sight gag and prompting Green to quip, "Nobody has a head as
big as mine."</LD>
<LD>   The reality, however, is pretty much the opposite. Green, an
alt-country phenomenon in Texas who's just starting to spread his
reputation outside the Lone Star State, is as grounded as they come.</LD>
<TE>   In a country world brimming with singers who were signed because
of the way they look in a hat or how they fill out a tight T-shirt
instead of how they write or sing, Pat Green is the real deal.</TE>
<TE>   His major-label debut album, "Three Days," is refreshingly free of
the stock phrases and over-generalized situations that too often pass
for songwriting. His songs look at social mavericks and loners who
ponder the big picture while knocking back beers and chomping Texas
barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Green wraps his witty and intelligent lyrics in catchy melodies
and tasty rhythms that bounce from straight country to sweeping
heartland rock to thick country funk. He and his six-piece band also
play live with fire and infectious camaraderie. That combination has
made Green a top draw in Texas after years of constant gigging.</TE>
<TE>   So although his weekend shows -- he also was among about a dozen
acts that played the annual KZLA (93.9 FM) Country Bash on Saturday
in Irvine -- were his first in Southern California, Green exhibited
the easy command of a veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Decompressing on the band's tour bus after the nearly two-hour set
at the Coach House, Green, accompanied by his wife, Kori, and their
chihuahua, seemed genuinely surprised by the intensity with which he
was greeted by the San Juan Capistrano audience.</TE>
<TE>   Fans sang along fervently not only with the album's title song and
"Carry On," tracks that have received airplay on KZLA, but also the
others he sang from "Three Days" and many from his earlier albums.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of die-hard people here tonight," Green said.
"We get all of the transplants, but I also noticed a lot of people
who likely are from around here singing with the other songs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how you make a career," he said. "A lot of musicians make
the mistake of thinking that if you have a hit or two, you'll sell a
lot of records and tickets right away. That's just not the case. If
you don't go out on tour, and you're not good on stage, you're not
going to sell records."</TE>
<TE>   Green, 30, has sold a respectable number for a musician who wasn't
known much beyond Texas a year ago. He's sold nearly a quarter
million copies combined of his five independent-label albums, and
almost 200,000 of "Three Days" since it was released by
Republic/Universal Records last October.</TE>
<TE>   Playing bars, theaters and arenas in Texas, Green got so
comfortable -- and not just because he typically shows up on stage
barefoot -- that for years he had no desire to play anywhere else. He
was successful enough releasing albums on his own that he could wait
for an offer that allowed him control over what he records.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting patiently came early to Green, who grew up in a blended
family with 11 children. Having so many brothers and sisters also
meant he was exposed to music of all kinds. His father acted in
musical theater, so on top of all the pop music he also was immersed
in Broadway and classical.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got that many kids, you need help, and a lady who
took care of us was a very country woman, and she brought country
into my life," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   "She listened to Merle Haggard, Jerry Jeff Walker, the Bellamy
Brothers, all the nuts and bolts of what country is. When I started
writing songs, that's what came out. Country music is a more specific
kind of writing, it's not quite as abstract, and that's where I feel
more comfortable."</TE>

<HD>Once feared lost, this relationship is in the bag again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynell George</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At one point, long ago, I was monogamous. Unwavering in my loyalty.
But all that changed -- as relationships often do. In the last 10
years or so, I've been on a somewhat indiscriminate search for just
the right match. Just the right sort of handsome accouterment to
sling across my shoulder in the most nonchalant way. A head-turner,
sure, but one as understated as it is distinctive.</LD>
<LD>   There's been a long string of handsome contenders: the floppy
Kenya bag. The weathered un-dyed leather professor satchel. There've
been mud-cloth totes and soft suede bucket bags. There've been
modified hobos in pebbled leather; fisherman's creels re-imagined as
rugged shoulder bags; a kimono stitched into a discreet quick-stop
clutch. But alas, nothing has quite hit the mark.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps because I know the difference between for-keeps and mere
fling: For nearly 14 years, I carried a classic Danish school bag.</LD>
<TE>   Truth be told, there were three. The first, brown; the second,
classic gray; and the third and last, black canvas (the better to
hide fountain pen leaks). I fell in love at first sight, when another
English major I worked with at a local bookstore walked in with a
flashy royal-blue model slung over her shoulder. I studied it hard.
As an undergrad, I'd grown unhappy with nylon backpacks or canvas
totes with cringe-inspiring messages like "Music is my bag!" This bag
said something else. Something that I more than likely would have to
grow into, but no matter. Even the name -- Globetrot -- inspired
grand aspirations. I welcomed the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Simple, understated, with a flat zippered flap that could be
secured with either buckled straps or a snap, the bags were
distinguished by a large cargo area that expanded like an accordion
file with one forgiving zip. There were pockets and side sleeves and
compartments within compartments. But the very special detail was the
metric ruler stowed away in a snug pocket at the top of the bag.</TE>
<TE>   Made out of heavy water-resistant canvas, they felt
indestructible. And for the most part I treated them as if they were.
They attended class, then graduated with me. Traveled to San
Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle, New Orleans and London with
me. They carried my Norton anthologies. My overnight particulars.
Lunch. My cameras and their various lenses. Later came the fat manila
files, reporter's notebooks, cassette recorder and tapes. They even
subbed -- in desperate times -- as swim bag or pillow. Then there
were no more. The funky clothing store in Westwood where I'd
religiously purchased them closed up tight. The mail order spot no
longer posted ads in the back of one of my music mags. And the
"just-in-case" East Coast connection dried up. Suddenly I was left
without not only a replacement but a next-step plan.</TE>
<TE>   I'm certainly not alone in my adoration or my longing. Rumor has
it that J.D. Salinger used to order his Danish school bags from a New
York boutique. Even when I carried my tattered, faded-to-almost-gray
bag, I'd be stopped on the street, in line at the movies or at the
grocery store by high school teachers, dancers, lawyers,
photographers, chefs, graphic artists, journalists, CPAs -- all of
whom wanted to know where they could get "that bag." People would pin
me to a wall to share a memory jogged by the mere sight of it:
impromptu romantic getaways. Travels through Madrid. The elaborate,
circuitous tales of attempting to hunt down another.</TE>
<TE>   A professor friend has tried to make do with all manner of
messenger-style carryalls he straps across his body -- tangible
evidence of his burden. He complains of shrinkage -- or, worse,
"snappage" -- when the poor bag breaks under the weight of theses and
dissertations. Woes he hadn't had with his old Globetrot.</TE>
<TE>   Another has had her lip stuck out over the whole matter since the
late '80s. "I had a black one. And a blue one. How many, total? Not
enough. I used my old one when I started as a script supervisor. I
could put everything in -- the script, pens, pencils, erasers." She's
tried those "thin, weeny things. Shoddy American knockoffs." She's
tried to move on. "It's like dating. They look really good in the
store, but then you try them and they just don't work. I have an
Eddie Bauer bag now, but I have to carry that and another bag, a
totebaggy thing. Another is a purse sort of thing ... with Kermit all
over. It's sort of fabulous ... "</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't have to finish: ... but it's no Danish school bag.</TE>
<TE>   For the last five years, I'd been scanning the Web, plugging in
all manner of descriptors to prod the search engine forward. I'd come
up with "Danish school style bag," which meant something in canvas,
but much thinner and prone to wrinkle in a fine mist. Then there were
the army surplus stores with their version of a school bag: flat
flap, two pockets, long strap, but some weird briefcase handle on
top. I even stuffed cash into the palms of traveling friends, hoping
they might spy one on their journeys across the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A glimmer of hope</TE>
<TE>   One night, I happened upon the site in Denmark for the company,
Sabroe &amp; Stephensen, that makes the authentic, original Globetrot
bag. After peering longingly at the thumbnails on the screen, as if
leafing through an old family album, I contacted the company. Many an
e-mail and phone call were exchanged, but I came up empty-handed. It
didn't honor credit cards, and I couldn't work out a way to untangle
the transaction over miles, bank transfers and exchange rate snags.
Crestfallen, I bought more bags. A huge black leather sack. A
black-canvas retro train mailbag -- smart, but largely
impractical....</TE>
<TE>   Then, about a month ago, inspired by nothing more than boredom --
or the latest imperfect buy -- I embarked on yet another Web search.
Just to see. I prowled around auction sites. Nosed around shopping
services. Tried another search engine. Then stumbled upon a
hiding-in-plain-sight site: www.danishschoolbag.com, the outfit, Gorm
Andersen &amp; Co. in East Windsor, N.J., that sells the original bag
exclusively in the States. Its Webmaster's story, posted on the site,
eerily mirrored my own. He too first coveted a friend's bag, then set
out on a circuitous journey to find one.</TE>
<TE>   During dinner with some friends near Copenhagen, he related the
story of his search to his host.  "After some rummaging through a
hallway closet, he returned with a bag almost exactly like the one my
friend owned back in Chicago, and to my surprise and delight, he made
me a gift of it. It was a little beat up and stained, but it was a
genuine Danish book bag." He traveled around the continent with it
slung over his shoulder until it was stolen from a friend's car in
Barcelona. "Back in the U.S., however, I finally found a little store
in New York City called "The Chocolate Soup" that sold the bags and
was able to purchase a new one at last. Danish book bags were quite
chic in the city at that time, and the gentleman who was importing
them from Denmark did a nice little business." Until that dried up.
"After discovering that the bags were no longer being imported into
the U.S., I tracked down the company in Denmark, and, well," he
enthuses, "here we are!"</TE>
<TE>   Mine arrived, it seemed, mere moments after I ordered it. I
slipped it from its plastic. It was all there, in black canvas: the
zippered flap. The twin snapped pockets. The buckles. The transparent
sleeve for stowing one's weekly schedule. And, of course, the wooden
metric ruler. And, stitched into the hem, the badge of authenticity
-- Denmark's red and white flag. Ah, the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   I adjusted the strap so it was at its longest. I slipped it over
my head, diagonally across my body, so the bag rested in just the
right place against my right hip -- like old times -- where it will
remain.</TE>

<HD>Octet kick-starts L.A. recital</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its ninth year of showcasing local dancers and choreographers,
Jazz Dance L.A. offered a marketplace of steps Sunday at Cal State
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Performed by about 90 volunteer dancers -- most of them
freelancers not affiliated with any performing company -- 11 short
pieces and one video tribute to dancer-choreographer-teacher Joe
Tremaine reflected the vitality and artistic potential of the
Southland's jazz, rock and commercial dance scene.</LD>
<LD>   However, most of the pieces stayed in the shadow of the opening
segment, Claude Thompson and Keny Long's "Killer Joe," partly because
this powerhouse male octet gave the Luckman Theatre audience its
first look at dynamic structural ploys that would be reiterated
throughout the afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   But its most indelible achievement was the dimension and detail of
the dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Where other groups simply flapped their limbs on cue, the "Killer
Joe" cast produced arm movement from deep within the back and leg
action just as deeply from the pelvis, projecting everything to the
next galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   There's no shortcut to the effect that this kind of dancing
generates -- certainly not in the well-drilled but shallowly produced
execution that so many of the other groups offered. Exceptions
included the men in Jackie Sleight-Carter and Michael Rooney's
celebratory "Legends of the Lost Art," the street-style tappers in
Chance Taylor's gritty "This One's for Hama" and nearly everyone in
Kenji Yamaguchi's ritualistic "Against the Wind," one of the few
pieces that tried to tell a story or create a distinctive style.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting the members of her Jazz Spectrum Dance Company,
Christine Baltes' "I Love You ... I'll Kill You" introduced a
melodramatic narrative at the very last moment but spent most of its
length pumping out classroom step-combinations. And most of the other
choreographers didn't even pretend that dance could be anything else.
At best, you could expect costuming flair, but, sooner or later, it
would all come down to the same double-turns in place with arms flung
wide at the end.</TE>
<TE>   A love duet with no love in it, Doug Caldwell's florid "One Hand,
One Heart" represented the most extreme example of step-obsession,
requiring the exemplary Brook Lipton and Mark Meismer to periodically
embrace but otherwise flingtheir technique in the audience's teeth.</TE>

<DH>The vegetarian designer opens her first shop in New York's
meat-packing district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York</LD>
<LD>   British fashion designer Stella McCartney's sweet, heart-shaped
face and innocent round eyes make her salty language and wicked wit
seem as if a ventriloquist should be standing at her side.</LD>
<LD>   McCartney's earthy humor isn't just for shock or for show, as is
so common with the privileged children of celebrity. She is, after
all, the daughter of a Beatle. Many things about the 30-year-old
designer reflect her yin-yang, naughty-nice approach to life and
fashion.</LD>
<TE>   Start with her designs. Her latest collection, shown Oct. 7 in
Paris, featured extra-slim pants contrasted with flowing, oversized
tops. A utilitarian bomber jacket was rendered huge in golden silk to
become an elegant strapless dress. She weighted a little mini and
tiny tops with wiggling strands of metal chains, giving fringe a punk
edge.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, for her debut signature collection, McCartney
commissioned a print that looked like a pastoral toile de Jouy of the
type that has been the rage among sentimental interior designers.
Closer inspection, however, revealed that the central figures weren't
milkmaids or musicians but horny monkeys with bad manners. That print
strained even the Botox-smoothed brows of the fashion community, yet
McCartney installed it on the walls of her first boutique, which
opened last month on 14th Street in the meat-packing district, a
location that's especially controversial for her.</TE>
<TE>   After her father, Paul McCartney, she may be one of the best-known
vegetarians on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   "Infiltrate from within," McCartney said with a wink as workmen
scrambled to ready her eponymous store for its opening-night party.
She didn't dwell on the subject or begin an animal-rights tirade.
Instead, she discussed her appreciation of the city's latest trendy
neighborhood, which also houses the chic Jeffrey store and Markt
restaurant as well as boutiques for designers Yigal Azrouel and
Alexander McQueen.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the area," McCartney said. "It has a fantastic feel and
there's amazing space. It's not really closed in here."</TE>
<TE>   Although the meat-packing district is decidedly more fashionable
than it was five years ago, the air carries a stench and the
sidewalks on her block are still slick with the greasy byproducts of
the meats shipped and processed at such enterprises as Lamb
Unlimited. When she walks to her shop, she picks a path past the
pleasanter-smelling bakery the Little Pie Co.</TE>
<TE>   "My landlord here used to deal in meat, and now he's a landlord,"
McCartney said. "That says it all. It's a changing time. I don't
think [the meat industry] is going to be around much longer. I feel
bad for the meat industry."</TE>
<TE>   But she feels worse for the animals. Her refusal to carry any
product derived from a dead animal could have prevented her from
finding backers for her own company, because leather accessories
historically are cash cows for luxury firms. She prevailed, however,
having won notice during her years as the head designer at the French
house of Chloe. Soon, the Italian luxury-goods conglomerate Gucci
Group, which specializes in leather accessories and even furs, came
courting.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a year ago, McCartney launched her namesake
label in partnership with Gucci Group, which also backs Sergio Rossi,
Boucheron and fellow Britisher McQueen, whose nearby boutique opened
a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Both McCartney and McQueen are scouting locations for stores in
Los Angeles, although neither will say exactly where. She will be in
L.A. on Thursday to launch Absolut vodka's new fashion collection ad
campaign, which will feature her.</TE>
<TE>   No matter where she settles, McCartney promised that the store
would have a distinct personality sensitive to its West Coast
environment. "Everything we put in here we designed ourselves," she
said as she led a tour past the hammering carpenters.</TE>
<TE>   "The fabric on the wall was hand silk-screened and designed," she
added, indicating the monkey print. Elsewhere, a seemingly static
wall of mirrors is actually a grid of mirror-faced drawers, each
lined with a surprise of colorful fabric. Contemporary tiled walls
contrast with antique fixtures. A spacious dressing room contains
astonishing marquetry panels that reflect her love of nature and that
of her mother, the late Linda McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   "These were my mum's favorites," she said, indicating a delicate
hummingbird. The boutique may be her most personal project yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I really got involved with this store," she said. "It really
reflects what I like to do in my work: Contrast interesting
opposites; take a pristine tailored jacket and mix it with a pair of
really distressed stonewashed jeans and a delicate chiffon pink top."</TE>
<TE>   It has taken fashion awhile to appreciate McCartney as a designer,
not just a celebrity. Some insiders seemed disappointed that the
Beatle didn't attend last Monday's show in Paris because he has been
a front-row supporter since her days at Chloe. (She said he was on
tour last week.) He missed her best work yet.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see her evolution," said Robert Burke, vice president
and fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. "It was a
little more sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   Her designs, like the woman herself, aren't everything they might
seem. Despite their soft colors, delicate trims and sexy cuts,
there's something of the tomboy that comes through.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps she was wary after blistering reviews for her oversexed
debut collection and for her flaccid second show: McCartney's latest
collection was softly colored, feminine and far less tarty. Dodging
the hail of flowers from friends, fans and tough fashion critics at
the show's finale, McCartney seemed overwhelmed by the audience's
outpouring of affection. She didn't cry, though she had a right to,
having just finished a critical show in her career.</TE>
<TE>   She's also working on a load of stamina-straining projects, which
includes planning a wedding to longtime boyfriend Alasdhair Willis,
former publisher of Wallpaper magazine. She's building a London
boutique and developing a lingerie collection, a fragrance and a
skin-care collection, and expanding an accessories collection that
explores non-animal alternatives to leather, a process that she
called a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney said she hopes to lead the fashion pack away from its
attachment to leather shoes and bags and toward her novel, often
highly decorated, silk, canvas and synthetic stilettos, studded boots
and swingy bags. She's declared that her shops will be friendly, cozy
and welcoming. Her sales associates will smile and be helpful. If
that comes true, McCartney may help rescue not just animals, but also
the sensibilities of many disaffected shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   As she said: Infiltrate from within.</TE>

<DH>The story so far: Harley has been given his first homework
assignment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Louise Downer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At school this morning, Mrs. Arturo, my teacher, said, "What I want
you to do for homework tonight is to draw a picture of somebody in
your family doing something they like to do best. Use at least three
different-colored crayons."</LD>
<LD>   All the other kids in the class got real excited. But not me.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to show my baby brother at the beach," my best friend,
Marco, said. "He likes to build sand castles."</LD>
<TE>   "I could draw my sister shopping at the mall," Lisbet said. "What
about you, Harley? What are you going to draw?"</TE>
<TE>   "I dunno," I mumbled, realizing I was going to have to draw
something or I'd fail my very first homework assignment.</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, I can't draw. I mean, anything!</TE>
<TE>   My first thought was to try to draw Mom cooking dinner, but I'm
pretty sure it isn't what she likes to do best.</TE>
<TE>   My Dad likes to play golf, but I've never actually seen him play,
so that's no good.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey likes to play soccer, but that would be really hard to
draw. You'd have to show a whole team in action. I wouldn't know
where to start.</TE>
<TE>   If I could draw Lizzy talking on the phone, she'd be doing what
she likes to do best. But she'd get mad if she noticed I was drawing
her. Lizzy can get you in a lot of trouble if she gets mad at you.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I could draw my dog, Tucker, catching a Frisbee. But Mrs.
Arturo might not consider Tucker a member of the family, even though
I do.</TE>
<TE>   The more I thought, the more I worried that my homework assignment
was going to be a real problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: Will Harley figure out something to do for his homework
assignment?</TE>

<HD>Revisiting horror of abuse at institution for the disabled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Samantha Bonar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It was like living in hell." So recalls Bernard of his 18 years at
Willowbrook, a state institution for the developmentally disabled on
New York's Staten Island.</LD>
<LD>   Mistakenly diagnosed, Bernard has cerebral palsy with no mental
impairment and thus is one of the only former residents who can
articulate the horror of the place, which was exposed in 1977 when
Geraldo Rivera sneaked in and filmed the conditions. Rivera found the
disabled inmates naked, beaten and eating off the floor. The
institution was subsequently shut down.</LD>
<LD>   But where did the residents go? "Unforgotten: Twenty-Five Years
After Willowbrook" (at 10 tonight on KCET) tracks down a few of them
and their families, and sensitively revisits the agonizing question
of what to do with society's most vulnerable.</LD>
<TE>   Since Willowbrook, the trend has gone from institutionalization to
community-based care.</TE>
<TE>   Pain is etched on the careworn faces of family members as they
tell of their guilt for having unknowingly let their children or
siblings suffer at Willowbrook.</TE>
<TE>   There is also weariness, as today much of the burden of the
disabled's care is placed on families.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary focuses most on siblings. Their feelings run the
gamut from affection to resentment. One man speaks of the
24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year attention his brother requires, and
how it has in part prevented him from starting his own family.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one of the most important messages of the film is that
these families need help. A gray area must be found between the
extremes of institutionalization and home care -- such as more group
homes, which now are in short supply.</TE>

<HD>AOL-MSN Rivalry Picks Up Speed With Broadband</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Walled Garden is under siege.</LD>
<LD>   America Online launches its latest software package, AOL 8.0, here
today with a splashy concert by Alanis Morissette, but it might as
well start with a call to battle as Microsoft Corp. gears up for
another push against the online giant.</LD>
<LD>   Through a combination of user-friendly technology and clever
marketing, America Online has created a virtual community -- dubbed
the Walled Garden by outsiders because much of its content is
available only to AOL members -- that rivals have found tough to
dent.</LD>
<TE>   AOL features such as instant messaging, parental controls on
children's Internet surfing and the familiar "@aol.com" e-mail
address have made for a stable subscriber base in an industry in
which fickle customers are the norm. AOL boasts more than 26 million
U.S. subscribers, compared with about 8 million for Microsoft's MSN
service.</TE>
<TE>   However, as more and more personal computer users migrate from
poky dial-up service to high-speed broadband, the competition will
intensify and it will get harder for AOL to maintain subscriber
growth and profitability, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, with a seemingly bottomless well of cash, announced it
will spend $300 million to support the Oct. 24 launch of its Internet
service software, MSN 8. Much of Microsoft's push will be aimed at
getting AOL customers to switch.</TE>
<TE>   And Microsoft, by no means coincidentally, also is kicking things
off with a New York launch party, headlined by singer Lenny Kravitz.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened competition and lower profit margins of broadband,
plus a brutal drought in online advertising and a widening federal
probe of America Online's accounting practices, explain why the unit
has been -- at least from Wall Street's perspective -- an anvil
around the neck of parent AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's other businesses -- movies, publishing, cable TV
and music -- are performing so well that their combined operating
profit growth is expected to rise a robust 16% this calendar year,
Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said last week in a report.</TE>
<TE>   But when you add America Online, she said, the figure drops to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   As AOL's network access costs rise in the coming years and the
fees it charges consumers fail to keep pace, its EBITDA -- earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a key profit
measure -- could shrink to $830 million in 2005 from $2.3 billion in
2001, Cohen added.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did nothing, it could look very much as [Cohen] portrays
it," Jonathan Miller, AOL's new chief executive, acknowledged in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not going to do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he said, AOL 8.0 incorporates some 100 improvements over
the current version, most of them in response to suggestions from AOL
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has high hopes for a "MatchChat" feature that will allow
users with similar interests to find one another online. Other
features make it easier to block junk e-mail, to share pictures and
music and to customize the content of the "home" screen.</TE>
<TE>   For an extra $3.95 a month, dial-up users get a call-waiting
service that notifies them of calls without breaking the connection.</TE>
<TE>   The new package also represents "the first time that AOL has
really embraced broadband," Miller said. Not only will such functions
as music- and picture-sharing work better and faster on broadband,
but there will be new features exclusively for high-speed
subscribers, including improved video and CD-quality radio.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, meanwhile, is counter-programming with mirror-like
precision.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the rival New York launch parties and the product names
both incorporating the number 8, Microsoft's new offering
incorporates for the first time some of the distinctive features of
AOL, such as controls that let parents monitor their children's use
of the Internet and block them from certain sites or chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft is not just matching what AOL offers, said Larry
Grothaus, lead project manager for MSN. As a software development
company first and foremost, Microsoft "prides itself on great
technological delivery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing will be one key front on which the broadband competition

<HD>Disney's 'Blockbuster' Angels Are Still for Sale</HD>
<DH>Despite win, team owner is entertaining offers from three
bidders</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle and James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after the Anaheim Angels won the American League championship
Sunday, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner compared the club to
a hit movie.</LD>
<LD>   "We're in the business of blockbusters, and this is our
blockbuster," Eisner boasted as the players whooped it up in the
clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The difference, of course, is that Eisner is not trying to sell
his studio, which makes money. He is trying to unload the team, which
ranks in the lower end of in baseball's economic scale. Not even a
World Series victory, according to analysts and academics, is likely
to reverse the Angel's financial losses.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, the Angels' surprise season probably means more to
long- suffering fans than it does to potential buyers sniffing around
the club.</TE>
<TE>   "The baseball team and its history and long-term prospects in
Anaheim, that's what's going to determine the sale value," said Rod
Fort, a sports economist at the University of Washington. "What the
Angels represent is a long-term economic asset that every once in a
while gets in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives, for their part, seem unwilling to wait. Last
month, then-Angel President Paul Pressler said of the team: "It isn't
a strategic asset."</TE>
<TE>   Disney first made it known three years ago that the team no longer
fit into its long-term strategy. During sales negotiations, the
company set a price of $300 million and couldn't find a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, major league sources say, Disney might entertain bids in the
$180-million range, and three potential buyers have emerged: Mexican
billionaire Carlos Peralta, who already owns pro baseball teams south
of the border; the Nederlander family, one of the last private major
entertainment impresarios in the U.S., which already books events at
Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond; and former baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth, whose investment group was outbid by Disney for the Angels
in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "What someone is likely to pay for a franchise is a function of
what they see the future cash flow being," said David Carter of Los
Angeles-based Sports Business Group. "You could make the argument
that the further the Angels advance, the more money they'll be able
to make next year, in terms of season ticket sales and group sales,
and in maybe enticing an additional sponsor or two that might have
been sitting on the fence."</TE>
<TE>   But that would help only so much.</TE>
<TE>   Before qualifying for the playoffs, the Angels were projecting an
$18-million loss this season despite a 15% increase in attendance.
Last year, when about $9 million from major league baseball's
revenue-sharing program was figured in, the Angels broke even,
according to figures MLB provided to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to the World Series could mean $13 million to $16 million
in extra revenue, the amount that baseball officials say was
generated by the Arizona Diamondbacks and New York Yankees in last
year's Fall Classic. Even with those additional millions, the Angels
project a money-losing season this year. The team could lose even
more next season if it has to bump up players' salaries to keep the
team intact.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest financial spike probably will occur next season, when
club officials expect season ticket sales to rise to more than 15,000
from 13,000 this season, and fan interest could lead local
broadcaster KCAL Channel 9 to air more Angels games, increasing the
team's television revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' winning ways are about the only bright spot for
Disney, which has seen a steep drop in its stock. Shares closed
Monday up 8 cents at $16.08 on the New York Stock Exchange, down from
the 52-week high of $25. Disney's ABC network also has struggled for
viewers, and even its theme parks -- particularly California
Adventure -- have suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Selling the Angels, and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey franchise,
won't right the ship, but it could signal to Wall Street that Disney
is ready to throw some things overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after Disney bought its first stake in the Angels,
after the death of founding owner Gene Autry, it bought the rest. The
company has been disappointed ever since. The Autry family sold in
part because it could no longer afford the team's escalating losses
in a baseball world run financially amok.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's core businesses are movies, television and theme parks,
not professional sports franchises. Disney hoped to use the Angels as
anchor programming for a planned ESPN regional cable network but was
outmaneuvered by Rupert Murdoch's Fox television network, which
bought the Los Angeles Dodgers and sewed up long-term television
contracts for both the Angels and the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Also important to Disney was that the teams stay in Anaheim and
help solidify the region as a multiple-purpose entertainment
destination -- one reason it spent $100 million to renovate Edison
Field. Then came the recession and the collapse of the tourism
industry in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Angels are among Disney's highest-profile assets at
the moment, the team plays a minor role in a corporation with $25
billion in annual revenue. In that mix, the Angels account for less
than half a penny of every Disney revenue dollar.</TE>
<TE>   According to Carter, a major league baseball franchise is
generally valued at about 2.5 times its annual revenue, which for the
Angels was about $91.4 million last year. That would put the team's
value at $228.5 million. Forbes magazine estimated the value at $195
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet economist Fort said a straight valuation based on revenue
tends to undervalue a professional sports franchise because of how a
team fits in with its owner's other holdings. A team that loses money
at the gate could ultimately mean huge profit if its owner also runs
the cable network that broadcasts the games and thus snags local ad
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of other values to having a particular team in
the stable of properties," Fort said. "This is true for every
baseball owner I can think of."</TE>

<HD>Boeing Beaten Out by Airbus for Major Order</HD>
<DH>European budget carrier EasyJet opts to acquire 120 A319s
instead of adding more 737s to its fleet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>By Peter Pae Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. lost a major jetliner order to its primary rival Monday
when Europe's largest budget airline said it would buy 120 Airbus
planes with a potential value of at least $4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by EasyJet to buy the 150-seat Airbus A319, the
largest single airliner order this year, came as a bitter blow to
Boeing, which has been struggling with dwindling orders for its jets
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Coupled with a general downturn in the economy, the attacks led to
a sharp drop in air travel, placing many airlines in a severe
financial crunch.</LD>
<TE>   Industry analysts said losing the contract to Airbus is likely to
prolong the slump in Boeing's commercial aircraft business, which
company executives had hoped would end by 2004. That scenario now
seems optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing is "considering flat to down production rates for 2004 for
large civil aircraft," Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst for
Merrill Lynch, wrote to investors Monday. "The loss of the EasyJet
competition to Airbus should bolster this view."</TE>
<TE>   The failure to win the contract prompted investors to unload
Boeing shares, which fell 94 cents to close at $31.06 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, winning the order also hurt shares of Airbus' parent,
European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co., which dropped 4.4% on the
Paris Stock Exchange as investors there worried that Europe's largest
commercial aircraft maker may have sweetened the pot too much to win
the bidding.</TE>
<TE>   London-based EasyJet said Airbus had offered it 30% in savings,
which included lower operating costs over its current fleet of Boeing
737s as well as a 20% discount on the price of the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "After exhaustive research and several rounds of negotiations with
both Airbus and Boeing, the board is convinced that we have achieved
a tremendous deal," EasyJet Chief Executive Ray Webster said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Like Southwest Airlines, EasyJet has become one of the few
profitable airlines by offering no-frills service.</TE>
<TE>   EasyJet, which recently acquired rival Go airlines, had been
operating a fleet made up exclusively of 737s.</TE>
<TE>   The 737 had been the favored plane by low-fare carriers, but
Boeing now has seen two major budget airlines shift to Airbus. New
York-based JetBlue Airways, which operates its Southern California
flight schedule out of Long Beach Airport, broke Boeing's
stranglehold in 1999 by selecting the Airbus A320 for its fleet.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Boeing won a major competition to supply 100 737s to
Ryanair, another European budget carrier.</TE>

<HD>Chiron Says It Will Beat Forecasts on Higher Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chiron Corp. said Monday that third-quarter profit, excluding
acquisition costs, was higher than it had forecast as sales increased
in all the biotechnology company's businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it earned 45 cents a share, excluding unspecified
expenses. The average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson First
Call is 32 cents. It posted earnings of 30 cents a share in the
year-earlier period, which excluded takeover costs.</LD>
<LD>   Chiron, based in Emeryville, Calif., makes vaccines,
blood-screening tests and products based on human proteins, such as
Betaseron for multiple sclerosis and Proleukin for cancer. The
results exclude expenses related to Chiron's acquisition of
Pathogenesis Corp. in 2000 and its purchase of a remaining stake in a
joint venture, Chiron Behring, in 1998, company spokesman John
Gallagher said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not sure if this is a one-quarter event or if it will
continue," said Frank DiLorenzo, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's
Equity. "My assumption is the blood testing has done well, and I
wouldn't be surprised if that's the main area of growth."</TE>
<TE>   DiLorenzo rates Chiron shares "accumulate" and doesn't own the
stock.</TE>
<TE>   The biotechnology company also raised its 2002 earnings forecast
to $1.25 to $1.30 a share, excluding acquisition costs, from $1.10 to
$1.20 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron will present full financial results Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Chiron shares rose $1.64 to $40.19 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Fund, Shareholders Sue Citigroup, Ebbers Over Loans</HD>
<DH>The suit contains the latest allegations that the financial
services firm offered favorable deals to executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc.'s insurance unit loaned $679 million in 1999 and 2000
to a company controlled by Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom Inc.'s
then-chief executive, creating a conflict of interest for the bank, a
shareholder lawsuit says.</LD>
<LD>   New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, trustee of the New York
State Common Retirement Fund, filed the complaint against Citigroup
and Ebbers on Friday on behalf of the fund and all other shareholders
suing WorldCom for alleged securities fraud. Citigroup denied
wrongdoing in making the loans and disputed loan details in the
complaint.</LD>
<LD>   The suit contains the latest shareholder and prosecutor
accusations that the biggest financial services company offered
favorable deals to executives of companies, including WorldCom, in
exchange for investment banking business. Several months after
Ebbers' company received the loans, WorldCom selected Citigroup to
arrange $17 billion in bond sales.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just another smoking gun," said John Krause, an analyst at
Thrivent Financial. "It shows there are reasons that Citigroup had to
hype the stock."</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Weill, Citigroup chairman, is moving to settle
investigations by lawmakers, regulators and prosecutors into possible
conflicts of interest between his bank's investment banking and
research units that have contributed to a 36% drop in Citigroup
shares this year.</TE>
<TE>   Weill's plan to combine corporate lending, retail brokerage and
investment banking businesses has attracted prosecutor and
congressional investigations and shareholder lawsuits. Those
investigating or suing Citigroup say it can't wear all its business
hats without favoring one set of clients over others.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup agreed Sept. 23 to pay $5 million to settle NASD charges
that former analyst Jack Grubman of its Salomon Smith Barney unit
misled investors by recommending shares of Winstar Communications
Inc. as the telecommunications company was sliding into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of more than 300 Internet-related companies have
alleged that Citigroup and other banks allocated shares of
high-demand initial stock offerings to executive clients, such as
Ebbers, in hopes of winning investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   The Citigroup loans to Ebbers' company, Joshua Timberlands,
allegedly were secured by WorldCom stock he owned, the lawsuit said.
That gave Citigroup and Grubman, its Salomon analyst, incentive to
promote WorldCom's stock to keep its price high, McCall said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup denied the charges. The bank said its Travelers
insurance unit loaned Ebbers' company $134 million of a $499-million
loan package -- not one totaling $679 million. The Travelers amount,
it said, was "fully secured by timber property and contracts, not
WorldCom stock." The $499 million in loans was arranged with three
other major insurance companies that Citigroup did not name.</TE>
<TE>   Two Travelers entities, Travelers Life &amp; Annuities and Travelers
Property Casualty, lent $82 million and $52 million, respectively to
Joshua Timberlands, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers is the only insurance company named on a "financing
statement" filed in Mississippi regarding Ebbers' purchase of the
real estate. That document, cited in the lawsuit, refers to a Feb.
15, 2000, amended agreement between Ebbers' company and Travelers
that covers two "mortgage" loans of $430 million and $69 million --
or $499 million.</TE>
<TE>   An amendment, filed Feb. 18, says the financing statement "shall
also pertain to a $180-million loan" between Ebbers' company and
Travelers.</TE>
<TE>   McCall, whose fund was named lead plaintiff in August, alleged
that Travelers lent Ebbers' entity $499 million in 1999 and an
additional $180 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Reid Weingarten, Ebbers' lawyer, did not return calls seeking
comment. WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore referred calls for comment
to Weingarten.</TE>
<TE>   The Travelers loans were made to fund the purchase of 460,000
acres of real estate in Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi, McCall's
complaint said. The real estate was purchased from Kimberly-Clark
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares fell 9 cents to $30.31 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</TE>

<LD>Dude, are you getting a pink slip?</LD>
<LD>   Dell Computer Corp.'s sales of personal computers have soared
since the advent of the fictional pitchman Steven, known for his
catch phrase, "Dude, you're getting a Dell!"</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps fearful of a backlash against the ubiquitous Steven,
who playfully harangues friends and strangers into buying a Dell PC,
the company said Monday that it is moving on to a new, less
dude-centric advertising campaign.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to look at some alternatives," said Dell spokesman
Bob Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman declined to say whether the "Steven" campaign was merely
on hiatus or gone for good.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, Steven, played by 21-year-old New York University
acting student Ben Curtis, has become a cult advertising figure not
seen since Joe Isuzu and Clara Peller of Wendy's "Where's the beef?"
fame.</TE>

<HD>Gateway to Carry More Electronics</HD>
<DH>The computer maker will bolster inventory with cameras, TVs
and other non-PC products as it seeks to boost sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to dig itself out of a persistent slump in personal
computer sales, Gateway Inc. on Monday announced a plan to stock its
274 retail stores heavily with digital cameras, printers and other
consumer electronics -- including its own brand of wide-screen,
flat-panel TV sets.</LD>
<LD>   The Poway, Calif.-based computer maker will add about 150 non-PC
products this week as part of its strategy to broaden offerings.
Gateway hopes to attract customers who want more hands-on help in
using computer accessories and other electronics than other retailers
provide.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway spokesman Brad Williams said that with the expansion, the
company will have $15 million in non-PC inventory and $20 million
worth of PC products by the end of the year, for a total of $35
million. The company three months ago started adding gradually to its
inventory of about $10 million, to about $20 million now.</LD>
<TE>   Charles Wolf, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co., said the latest step
in Gateway's strategy might have risks but makes sense. The company
-- which lost $61 million, or 19 cents a share, in the second quarter
-- is a long way from breaking even and needs to focus on turning
around falling sales rather than cutting expenses, Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to generate revenue if they ever have a hope of
breaking into profitability. It doesn't matter what they sell," said
Wolf, who rates the stock a hold and personally owns about 5,000
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway has the real estate available, and the stores were light
on product selection, he said. Stores are expensive to maintain, but
Wolf considers them essential to Gateway.</TE>
<TE>   Like Apple Computer Inc., the only other computer maker with its
own stores, Gateway can attract customers by providing service that's
superior to other retail outlets and allowing customers to try out
products, Wolf said. (Wolf also owns about 12,000 shares of Apple,
which he rates a buy.)</TE>
<TE>   Digital electronics in general sell at a higher margin than
personal computers, Wolf said. And stocking up on those products
could boost sales of Gateway's how-to courses, which pull in even
higher margins, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway is scheduled to report third-quarter results Thursday. The
consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call is a
loss of 15 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company posted a worse-than-expected loss for the second
quarter, with sales down 33% to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway ranked fourth in U.S. market share for PC shipments, with
6.1%, in the second quarter, according to Gartner Dataquest.</TE>
<TE>   Shares fell 36 cents to $2.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Global's Ex-Chief Demands Back Rent</HD>
<DH>Leo Hindery Jr., who was CEO for seven months, seeks
$822,000 for payments on a Park Avenue apartment and severance
benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former chief executive who served just seven months at the helm of
Global Crossing Ltd. is pressing the company to cough up back rent on
a Park Avenue apartment and salary payments he says are owed to him.</LD>
<LD>   The $822,000 request from Leo J. Hindery Jr., who served as Global
Crossing's third CEO, includes payments to cover the $22,000 monthly
rent on his former two-bedroom apartment in the Waldorf-Astoria,
known for its famous tenants.</LD>
<LD>   Hindery moved out of the apartment in June. But his motion for
payment, filed Friday in Bankruptcy Court, is bound to draw
additional attention to the telecommunications firm's penchant for
offering top officers lucrative pay packages, perks and severance
agreements. The request will be considered at a hearing set for Oct.
24.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
are investigating accounting issues and executive stock sales at
Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28. The
company, which had offices in Beverly Hills, built a worldwide
fiber-optic network but was unable to cover its debt when it was
dragged down by an industrywide slump.</TE>
<TE>   Hindery was not CEO during the period being investigated, and his
stock options were primarily in GlobalCenter, a Web-hosting
subsidiary. Most of his options became worthless before he was able
to exercise them.</TE>
<TE>   Five chief executives, including current CEO John Legere,
collected generous salaries, a variety of perks and millions of
dollars in forgiven loans from Global Crossing since its founding in
1997. Hindery is the only former CEO to take payment of his severance
package in monthly installments, and thus is the only former top
officer still owed payments.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing stopped payments to Hindery -- as well as to
thousands of laid-off employees also owed severance -- after
submitting its Chapter 11 filing.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has laid off thousands of workers,
shuttered offices and canceled scores of contracts with suppliers,
landlords and others.</TE>
<TE>   In an August filing in Bankruptcy Court, Global Crossing sought
the court's permission to cancel its contract with Hindery. Global
Crossing declined to comment Monday on the Hindery matter, but said
in the filing that abandoning the severance deal "is a good business
decision" that benefits the company and its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Hindery was Global Crossing's chief executive for seven months.
Upon his departure in October 2000, Hindery agreed to be available to
consult with the new CEO, and the company agreed to pay rent on his
apartment until this month.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of a lump-sum severance payment, the company also agreed
to pay Hindery nearly $1 million annually until the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Hindery declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Philip S. Khinda, an attorney representing Hindery, downplayed his
payment request, calling it "a routine filing ... just like the
scores of filings made by others in the course of administering this
bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Hindery is seeking payment of amounts that should have
been paid in 2002, including $113,381 in rent through June and more
than $708,000 in overdue severance.</TE>
<TE>   Although the requested payments loom large for a firm in
bankruptcy, they are small compared with the amounts Global Crossing
has handed over to other executives.</TE>
<TE>   Legere is being paid $5.3 million a year in salary, bonuses and
retention pay, and has been paid about $7 million in a signing bonus
and tax payments. In January, the firm paid him $4.8 million to cover
taxes on a $15-million loan that was forgiven by sister firm Asia
Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Casey, who succeeded Hindery as CEO, held the post for a year
before he was replaced by Legere. Casey was paid about $13 million in
2000, including a lump sum of nearly $3.5 million in severance.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming CEO of Global Crossing, Hindery served as CEO of
the company's GlobalCenter Web-hosting subsidiary. After resigning
from Global Crossing, Hindery stayed on at GlobalCenter to help
complete its sale to Exodus Communications Inc. in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hindery was offered options worth 5% of GlobalCenter, but they
were rendered worthless when the unit scrapped plans for an initial
public offering and was bought by Exodus Communications, a company
that subsequently filed for bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Halloween Sales Forecast Looks Scary for Retailers</HD>
<DH>A survey predicts flat results as consumers curtail
spending amid concerns about the shaky economy and public safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers are spooked by a sluggish economy, which could make it hard
for manufacturers and retailers to scare up the heady Halloween
business they have seen in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   A survey released Monday by the National Retail Federation
forecast that U.S. sales of candy, costumes and decorations for
Halloween would be flat, at about $6.9 billion, compared with last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Halloween "kind of went into a little bit of a slump," said
federation spokesman Scott Krugman. "It might take a year or two, but
we expect it to recover."</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, Halloween sales nearly tripled from about $2.5 billion in
1995 as the holiday expanded beyond its traditional Oct. 31 date into
more comprehensive autumn celebrations throughout September and
October. It is the second-biggest shopping holiday, after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   This year consumers plan to spend about $44 per household on
candy, costumes and decorations for the Halloween season, down
slightly from about $45 last year, the federation predicts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the U.S. economic slowdown, analysts said a number
of high-profile abductions of children and the unsolved fatal
shootings by a sniper in the Washington area may be adding to concern
about public holidays involving children.</TE>
<TE>   "A part of the flattening out is absolutely driven by ... a
consumer change over the idea of Halloween and having your kids out,"
said Neil Stern, a partner with Chicago-based retail consulting firm
McMillan/Doolittle. "That one is going to linger for a while."</TE>
<TE>   A reduction in spending momentum could be particularly hard for
candy makers such as Hershey Foods Corp., Kraft Foods Inc. and Nestle
that depend on robust Halloween sales, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Candy sales make up about one-third to one-half of all dollars
spent on Halloween, the NRF said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. candy sales in the four weeks ended Sept. 7, the most recent
period available, were down 1.5% compared with the same period in
2001, according to data tracking firm A.C. Nielsen. That is on top of
a slim 1.5% gain in August.</TE>
<TE>   "The September data indicated to me that Halloween sales were good
but not great," said Merrill Lynch analyst Leonard Teitelbaum.</TE>
<TE>   Overall retail sales for September, a key early indicator of
Halloween shopping trends, are showing that big stores may have
difficulty pushing the confections, costumes and decorations off
store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. consumers curtailed spending in the month, crimping growth at
the nation's big chain stores and knocking the already anemic economy
off course.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest worldwide retailer, met its
lowered sales expectations, but said that although Hallo-
ween-related sales improved through September, they "are not where we
would like them."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that might help manufacturers and retailers is the
unseasonably warm weather, which could mean a spike in sales closer
to the Halloween holiday.</TE>

<HD>California Sees Drop in Hotel Sales, Prices, Survey Says</HD>
<DH>The industry is still being hurt by last year's terrorist
attacks. The first-half downturn is acute in the Bay Area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of hotels sold in California -- and the prices they
fetched -- fell sharply during the first half of this year as
investors retreated from an industry still feeling the effects of
last year's terrorist attacks, according to a survey to be released
today.</LD>
<LD>   Hotel sales fell 18% to 100 in the January-to-June period from 122
sales in the year-earlier period, and the average sale price dropped
17% to $4.7 million, said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality
Group, a Costa Mesa hotel broker and consulting firm.</LD>
<LD>   The downturn is caused in large part by a disagreement in hotel
values between buyers and sellers, Reay said.</LD>
<TE>   "Many sellers believe the value of their properties should be
based on the revenues they were generating before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks," he said, noting that revenue had begun to slip
even before the attacks and still haven't recovered to 2000 levels.</TE>
<TE>   That's reflected in the average per-room sales price -- a key
measure of the industry's health -- which fell 4.7% to $56,350,
Reay's survey found. The average size of hotels sold during the
period was 85 rooms, up 11% from 77 rooms a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Falling interest rates also have helped prevent some sales, said
Jim Butler, chairman of the global hospitality group at Century City
law firm Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp; Marmaro. Some hotel owners in
financial trouble have been able to avoid foreclosure by financing
their debts at lower interest rates and retaining their properties.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people saw the recession of 2001 and 9/11 and predicted
a tidal wave of hotel failures," Butler said. "It has been a trickle,
a fraction of what many people expected."</TE>
<TE>   The first-half sales downturn was especially acute in the Bay
Area, where the hotel industry has been dragged down by the dot-com
collapse and falling tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The number of hotels sold in Northern California fell 24% to 25
properties as the average price per room slipped 1.8% to $68,431. The
Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco sold for $76.2 million, or
$188,101 per room, which also was the highest recorded sale in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Some struggling San Francisco hotel owners will be anxious to sell
within six months to a year, but they may have difficulty finding
buyers because occupancy levels and rental revenue still are
shrinking, Reay said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a falling market like that, it's hard to sell
assets because investors don't know where the bottom is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of hotel sales in Los Angeles County fell 21% to 26
properties during the first half of the year, and the average price
per room dropped 10.7% to $45,057. The largest hotel sold during the
period was the 770-room Furama Hotel Los Angeles, whose sales price
could not be determined. After that, the largest recorded sale was
the 393-room Hilton Long Beach, which sold for $38 million, or
$96,692 per room.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County bucked the trend as investors continued to bet on
that region's long-term tourism and convention business, Reay said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel sales doubled to 16 properties, and the average price per
room soared 50% to $63,625. Among the sales were the 180-room Holiday
Inn Orange County Airport in Santa Ana, which fetched $12.1 million,
or $67,222 per room, and the 39-room La Casa del Camino in Laguna
Beach, which sold for $5.3 million, or $134,615 per room.</TE>
<TE>   All told, sales of California hotels probably will total less than
$1 billion in 2002, compared with $1.3 billion last year and a record
$2.6 billion in 1998, Reay said.</TE>
<TE>   The business, however, is still profitable, although final
receipts are expected to be less than last year's $16.2 billion
nationwide, Butler said.</TE>

<HD>Hughes' Loss Narrows on Investment Gain</HD>
<DH>Revenue rises 5% in the third quarter with help from the
sales of its NFL package, but the full-year forecast is cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hughes Electronics Corp. dramatically narrowed its loss in the third
quarter to $13.6 million, from $227.2 million a year earlier, as a
result of improvements at the company's DirecTV satellite unit and a
one-time gain from investments.</LD>
<LD>   The company's revenue increased 5% in the quarter to $2.2 billion
from $2.1 billion a year earlier. The company does not issue
per-share results because it is a tracking stock of General Motors
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   But Hughes cut its revenue forecast for the full year because of
currency devaluations affecting its Latin American DirecTV unit.
Hughes said full-year revenue would be $8.9 billion to $9 billion,
down from its earlier forecast of $9 billion to $9.2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The company also said its full-year earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization would be at the low end of a
forecast of $750 million to $850 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the El Segundo-based satellite company fell 24 cents on
Monday, to close at $8.52 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has fallen 45% this year, in part because of doubts
about the proposed acquisition of Hughes by its satellite-TV rival
EchoStar Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the Federal Communications Commission rejected the
DirecTV-EchoStar deal because of monopoly concerns that would result
by combining the nation's only two satellite services. On Monday,
Jack Shaw, Hughes' chief executive, said the companies expect to file
a revised merger proposal with the FCC and the U.S. Department of
Justice as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   During the third quarter, Hughes continued to post disappointing
growth at its DirecTV satellite unit.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV added 206,000 subscribers in the quarter, less than the
company's original estimates of 250,000 to 300,000 additional
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes attributed the slowdown to a recent crackdown on piracy.
DirecTV recently cut off service to 50,000 customers who were using
counterfeit access cards to pirate premium TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV has been growing more slowly than its rival EchoStar and
ended the third quarter with 10.92 million subscribers, up 10% from
9.92 million in last year's third quarter. By comparison, EchoStar
had 7.46 million subscribers as of June, up 23% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said Hughes was able to increase revenue during the
third quarter in part because of strong sales of its National
Football League package and its pay-per-view telecast of the Oscar De
La Hoya-Fernando Vargas boxing match.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' quarterly results were helped by a pre-tax gain of $158
million from the sale of Thomson Multimedia stock. The company's cash
flow, excluding one-time charges, jumped to $141.8 million in the
third quarter, up from $76.5 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   For the first nine months, Hughes posted a net loss of $325.1
million, compared with a $489-million loss in the same period last
year. Revenue increased 8% to $6.46 billion, up from $5.98 billion in
the first nine months of 2001.</TE>

<HD>Kelly Gray to Succeed Dad as CEO of St. John Knits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kelly Gray, co-president and signature model of upscale clothier St.
John Knits International Inc., will become co-chief executive after
the retirement of her father and company founder, Robert E. Gray, the
firm said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, 76-year-old Robert Gray said he also was stepping
down as chairman of the board. He will be succeeded by Jim Kelley,
managing director of Vestar Capital Partners, which is St. John's
majority stockholder.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly Gray, 36, will share the CEO title with Bruce Fetter, who
also is the Irvine company's chief operating officer. The pair have
been co-presidents since last October. Kelly Gray also is the
company's creative director.</LD>
<TE>   The changes will take effect next month, the statement said.
Company representatives could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Co-founder Marie Gray, 66, will remain head designer of privately
held St. John Knits.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time that Robert Gray has stepped down from the
chief executive post. Last year, he was briefly succeeded by former
Neiman Marcus executive H.W. Mullins, the first outsider to head the
firm. When Mullins resigned after eight months on the job, Gray took
back the post.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Gray's ascent within St. John's management was questioned by
some during the six years St. John was publicly held. When she was
appointed president in 1996 at age 29, the company's stock lost 7.5%
of its value in one day.</TE>
<TE>   But as she continued to gain experience in the job, admirers said
she was primed for the higher post.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Rise for a Third Session</HD>
<DH>Investors continue the rally of last week ahead of
corporate earnings reports. Initially, the bombing in Bali pushed
shares lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks climbed for the third straight session Monday as optimism that
stoked last week's rally overcame fears of more terror attacks
sparked by the deadly bombing in Bali.</LD>
<LD>   The market slumped at the open, shaken by reports of the blasts
that killed more than 180 people Saturday on the Indonesian island.
The attack fueled fears that Al Qaeda, blamed for last year's
terrorist attacks, is regrouping and planning more assaults.</LD>
<LD>   But stocks erased the early losses, giving the broader market its
first three-day rally in a month. Investors, although bracing for a
flood of corporate earnings reports due out this week, extended the
big rally of Thursday and Friday that sent the Dow industrials up 564
points and snapped a six-week losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   "We've shrugged off the terrorism attacks from the weekend and
we're keying off a positive mood seen at the end of last week," said
Michael Palazzi, head of Nasdaq trading for SG Cowen.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 100 points in
early trading, finished up 27.11 points, or 0.4%, at 7,877.40. The
Nasdaq composite index was up 10.06 points, or 0.8%, at 1,220.53. The
broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 6.12 points, or 0.7%, to
841.44.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was very light ahead of the upcoming flood of quarterly
financial reports, with many traders out for the Columbus Day
holiday. The Treasury market was shut for the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 16 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little bit of a follow-through from last week's
momentum," said Bob Basel, senior trader at Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Traders noted, however, that the market was at five-year lows as
recently as Wednesday, and a string of disappointing profit reports
this week could spark a new round of selling.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 members of the S&amp;P 500 are set to report earnings this
week. Chip leader Intel and health-care products maker Johnson &amp;
Johnson are due to report today, while IBM is expected to report
Wednesday and Microsoft on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Drug stocks helped fuel Monday's rise. Dow member Merck rose $2.30
to $49.60 after a federal court ruled late Friday that Andrx and
three other generic makers infringed on AstraZeneca's patents for the
heartburn drug Prilosec. AstraZeneca climbed $4.05 to $36.60, while
Andrx fell $7.99 to $12.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America's resident bear Thomas McManus added to the upbeat
mood when the strategist raised his recommended stock weighting to
70% of a model portfolio from 65%, saying last week's surge was a
signal that the market may be reaching a bottom.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil and oil-services companies rallied as crude oil had its
biggest gain in three weeks. Amerada Hess gained $1.98 to $65.50 and
Occidental Petroleum advanced 79 cents to $29.19. Among drilling
companies, Nabors Industries gained $2.45 to $34.30, BJ Services rose
$1.48 to $28.80 and Rowan climbed $1.33 to $20.33.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors, Ford Motor and Delphi fell after Merrill Lynch
lowered its rating on the stocks to "neutral" from "buy." A worsening
outlook for the auto industry will result in narrower profit margins,
the firm said. GM, the world's biggest carmaker, dropped $1.56 to
$33.26. Ford, No. 2 in the U.S., declined 39 cents to $7.93. Delphi
lost 51 cents to $7.01.</TE>
<TE>   * Pilgrim's Pride shares were the second-biggest percentage losers
on the NYSE. The stock tumbled $1.73, or 25%, to $5.28 after the No.
2 U.S. poultry producer launched the largest U.S. meat recall in
history, due to possible listeria contamination.</TE>
<TE>   * Some Asian markets managed gains despite the bombing in Bali,
but Indonesia's stock market lost more than 10%. European markets
also were lower, with key indexes down 2.8% in Germany and 0.6% in
France and Britain. Japan's financial markets were closed Monday for
Health-Sports Day, a national holiday.</TE>

<HD>Energy Traders Reviewing Price Index Raw Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mirant Corp. and rival U.S. energy traders are reviewing the accuracy
of prices used to set energy contracts after Dynegy Inc. and American
Electric Power Co. disclosed they provided bogus data to trade
journals.</LD>
<LD>   Mirant, the largest natural-gas trader in North America, said it's
verifying gas and electricity prices that it provided trade journals.
Duke Energy Corp., the No. 2 gas trader, and Reliant Resources Inc.
said they are checking gas-price reports.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators are probing whether companies fed trade journals phony
data to manipulate energy prices. Last week the government subpoenaed
Platts, a McGraw-Hill Cos. division, as part of the inquiry. Journals
typically compile the information from surveys of anonymous traders
to calculate price indexes. The lists are a basis for some contracts
in the energy industry, in which companies rarely make prices public.</LD>
<TE>   "Most contracts, directly or indirectly, are tied to one of these
indexes," said Arthur Corbin, president of the Municipal Gas
Authority of Georgia, which buys natural gas for 580 cities.</TE>
<TE>   American Electric last week fired five energy traders the company
said had given phony Gulf Coast gas prices to Platts. Dynegy reported
Sept. 26 that its traders also gave trade publications false prices.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking into it," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for
Reliant Resources, a cross-town rival to Dynegy in Houston. "We've no
reason to believe any of the data our employees have given out in the
past in this regard was inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission subpoenaed Platts for
lists of subscribers and employees who gathered prices. It also asked
for "any information that indicates any person's knowledge of false,
inaccurate or otherwise incorrect pricing and volume information."
The subpoena was dated Sept. 9, when American Electric disclosed its
false reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the commission weren't available for comment. Jim
Keener, a Platts spokesman, said the company intends to comply "as
fully as we can as a journalistic entity."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators are looking at whether false prices helped drive up the
cost of electricity and natural gas during California's 2001-02
energy crisis.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq's SuperMontage Makes Trading Debut</HD>
<DH>The new system lets traders enter orders anonymously, as
well as post several quotes to buy or sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three years and an $100-million investment, the Nasdaq Stock
Market on Monday began trading stocks in an upgraded system that it
hopes will increase its trading volumes and win back market share
from alternative share-trading networks.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 2 U.S. stock market started trading five low-volume stocks
in the system, which is called SuperMontage.</LD>
<LD>   "It's good to have this day.... It went just the way it was
supposed to," said Dean Furbush, Nasdaq vice president.</LD>
<TE>   He said no major glitches were reported throughout the trading
day.</TE>
<TE>   But it was hard to tell whether the stocks were trading
differently than usual because of the extremely light volume.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good they're going about this slowly," Robert Mikkelsen,
head of Nasdaq trading at Advest Group Inc., said of the roll-out of
SuperMontage. "A few kinks in the beginning is not going to concern
us."</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq has touted the system, which received final approval from
the Securities and Exchange Commission this summer, as a boon to
investors.</TE>
<TE>   More securities will be added over the coming weeks, with all
Nasdaq-listed securities trading on SuperMontage by the end of the
year, Nasdaq said.</TE>
<TE>   SuperMontage allows brokers to post several quotes to buy or sell
a stock, rather than just one. SuperMontage also displays how much
stock is available at five price levels of quotes, rather than just
the one that is now displayed, showing the best bid and offer prices.</TE>
<TE>   The new system lets traders enter orders anonymously so that large
buyers or sellers of a stock can hide their identities when trying to
complete a trade. It will allow for automatic execution, which is
expected to make trading faster.</TE>
<TE>   "The new trading platform is the culmination of a commitment to
provide investors with a transparent, deeper and more liquid market,"
said Hardwick Simmons, chairman and chief executive of Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Its roll-out comes as electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
have used quicker trading systems to wrest market share from Nasdaq.
ECNs such as Instinet Group Inc., which is majority-owned by global
news and information company Reuters Group, lobbied against having to
post their quotes on the system on concerns that Nasdaq would gain an
unfair advantage and take away business.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet asked for and received approval from the SEC to post its
quotes on a separate system, known as the alternative display
facility.</TE>
<TE>   NASD, which runs the alternative display system, said Monday that
the system began accepting quotes from Instinet for the five stocks
that are trading on SuperMontage. Instinet said the roll-out of
stocks on the alternative system would mirror Nasdaq's SuperMontage
roll-out.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq is being spun off from NASD, formerly known as the National
Assn. of Securities Dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The true test of SuperMontage will come as more popular stocks are
added to the system, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to look toward Nov. 1, once you have 100 stocks or so
on the system," said Chris Wasson, director of Nasdaq trading at Legg
Mason Wood Walker Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you'll have a better gauge. And I think it's really going to
take a month, two months of broker-dealers, ECNs, market participants
using the system to gauge how well everything is working."</TE>
<TE>   Furbush said he is looking forward to getting a better picture of
how the system is working when 12 more stocks are added Thursday. But
he agreed that it would take a while to get the full effect of the
system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that will play out over months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The five stocks now trading on SuperMontage are WVS Financial
Corp., Willamette Valley Vineyards Inc., Waste Industries USA Inc.,
Excel Technology Inc. and Yardville National Bancorp.</TE>

<LD>   Although California primarily relies on Alaskan crude for gasoline
supplies, continued increases in oil prices worldwide could mean
higher prices for motorists here. Within the next two or three weeks,
the price at the pump could rise by 17 cents a gallon, an increase of
about 11%, said Bob van der Valk, bulk fuels manager for Cosby Oil
Co., an independent fuel distributor based in Santa Fe Springs.</LD>
<LD>   "In the total picture, we're just as connected to the world on
crude oil pricing as the rest of the country," Van der Valk said. The
prices Californians are now paying are "not going to last." The
latest figures from the Department of Energy peg the average price
for a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline in California at $1.546.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, meanwhile, shaken Indonesian government officials
ordered increased security at oil and natural gas facilities operated
by ChevronTexaco Corp. of San Francisco, Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving,
Texas, and other U.S. energy companies, which are among the top
investors in Indonesia's energy sector.</TE>
<TE>   The London-based International Maritime Bureau also has warned oil
firms to step up their protection of tankers traveling in the Middle
East and along the Malay Peninsula near Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of ChevronTexaco and Exxon Mobil said they were
monitoring the situation in Indonesia closely and as of late Monday
were not evacuating personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's spike in oil prices reflected a belief in energy markets
that Saturday's bombing in Indonesia -- a major producer of oil and
natural gas and a member of the OPEC cartel -- increases the
likelihood of U.S.-led military action against Iraq and a disruption
in oil and gas supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil for November delivery rose 66 cents, or 2.5%, to $30.03
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest daily
increase since Sept. 23. So far this year, oil prices have risen 51%.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's car bomb attack on a nightclub on the Indonesian island
of Bali killed at least 188 people, most of them foreigners. That
followed an incident last week in which Yemeni officials blamed
terrorists for damaging a French oil tanker.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is reacting to the first large attack in a natural gas
and oil producing country," said Kate Warne, a senior energy analyst
with Edward Jones, a brokerage in St. Louis. "There is nervousness
about supply dis- ruptions anywhere. The real question is whether in
the next few weeks or months we actually see that disruption occur."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist threats and escalating tensions in the Middle East
have created new headaches for U.S. energy firms already struggling
with the fallout of the Enron Corp. scandal and supply disruptions
caused by recent tropical storms.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a definite ripple effect here in terms of costs because
of heightened security precautions and higher insurance rates," said
analyst Tim Evans at IFR Pegasus in New York. "Ultimately, the oil
companies will be trying to the best of their ability to pass those
costs on."</TE>
<TE>   Threats against foreign energy companies are particularly
worrisome to Indonesia, which depends on oil and gas exports to
support an economy still struggling to recover from the 1997
financial crisis, violent regional conflicts and political
instability. Tourism, the country's third-largest source of foreign
currency, suffered a potentially crippling blow with Saturday's
attack in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Indonesian stock market lost more than 10% of its
value and the rupiah, the Indonesian currency, fell to a five-month
low. Markets in Japan, the region's largest, were closed for a
national holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's economic problems and the global downturn have
curtailed the country's energy production.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Indonesia exports a little more than 1 million barrels of
crude oil a day, said Philip A. Verleger, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He said a disruption to
Indonesia's oil exports is unlikely to have major repercussions on
world markets, given alternative supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia, however, produces about 20% of the world's natural gas.
Its biggest customer is Japan, which buys 30% of its supply from
Indonesia.</TE>

<HD>OpenTV to Cut 47% of Jobs, Shut Offices to Reduce Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OpenTV Corp., a maker of software for interactive television, will
fire 315 employees, or about 47% of its work force, and close eight
offices.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it will save about $60 million a year after the
cuts and expects to complete the measures, at a cost of about $29
million before taxes, by the end of the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   OpenTV in August said it no longer expected revenue growth in the
second half and planned to reduce expenses by more than $20 million a
year.</LD>
<TE>   Liberty Media Corp., the cable-TV company run by John Malone,
bought control of OpenTV later that month, and the new board urged
deeper cuts, Chief Executive James Ackerman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt as a board that we needed to go very deep in this
restructuring," Ackerman said. "The market for digital interactive
television is going to be slow for a while. We're reducing the
company to a size that's in line with where revenues are today."</TE>
<TE>   OpenTV provides software that allows people to access the Internet
from their television sets, play along with game shows or choose
instant replays during sports broadcasts. The company earns royalty
fees every time a set-top box containing its software is shipped, and
shipments have slowed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 3 cents to $1.18 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Both Sides Keeping Tabs on Port Work</HD>
<DH>Dispute between union, shipping lines over the pace of
handling cargo may end up in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tensions escalated Monday over the pace of work on West Coast docks,
with both the longshore union and shipping lines carefully
documenting the loading and unloading of cargo containers.</LD>
<LD>   The issue may soon end up before a federal judge.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which is representing the cargo
carriers, said orchestrated union slowdowns have cut production by
25% at commercial ports from San Diego to Seattle. The International
Longshore and Warehouse Union blamed the productivity drop on
congestion and shortages of equipment after the 10-day lockout by the
maritime association.</LD>
<TE>   The shipping group may present what it describes as ample evidence
of a slowdown to the U.S. attorney's office, said PMA spokesman Steve
Sugerman. "That decision has not been made," he said. "We are trying
to work with the union and having a very hard time getting their
cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. attorney agrees there is evidence of a slowdown, it
could ask U.S. District Judge William Alsup for sanctions, including
fines or jail sentences, against the union and its leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Alsup ordered an end to the lockout last week after President Bush
sought an injunction under the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act. In
granting the injunction, Alsup triggered an 80-day cooling-off period
that forced both sides to resume operations. The order also requires
the union to work at a "normal and reasonable" pace.</TE>
<TE>   The union and employers group have been in contentious contract
talks for five months, unable to agree on how to introduce
job-cutting technology at the terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Employers alleged the union staged a slowdown last month to gain
leverage in the talks. In response, the shipping group locked out the
workers for 10 days ending Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   With docks idled, more than 200 giant container vessels stacked up
along the coast, creating a backlog of cargo that could take weeks to
clear.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the court may find it difficult to decide what is
"normal."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, trucks are arriving at terminal gates with
containers that should have shipped out weeks ago on vessels that are
long gone. Marine clerks must find space on other vessels to take
them, a process that can take several hours a truckload, said union
spokesman Steve Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   Such complications are the rule these days, Stallone said. A
shortage of empty containers means trucks are unable to take the
empties to exporters, which must load the containers to ship their
goods. A shortage of truck trailers means the containers can't be
moved.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster its argument, the union, backed by the national
AFL-CIO, has asked federal and state safety inspectors to watch
workers perform at terminals. So far, only California's health and
safety program, Cal/OSHA, has sent extra inspectors, the union and
shipping group said. State and federal offices were closed Monday.</TE>

<HD>USDA Criticized Over Bacteria Testing</HD>
<DH>Consumer advocates says the department has been slow to
implement measures to protect meat against listeria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the launch of the largest meat recall in the nation's
history, consumer advocates Monday accused the U.S. Department of
Agriculture of foot-dragging for failing to adopt testing that could
detect bacterial contamination at processing plants.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's expanded recall pulled 27.4 million pounds of
ready-to-eat fresh and frozen turkey and chicken from stores and
restaurants, after the Pilgrim's Pride Corp. plant in Pennsylvania
that processed the meat was found to be contaminated with listeria
monocytogenes bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Little of the recalled meat appears to have wound up in Southern
California supermarkets. Ralphs, Albertson's and Vons stores in
California did not stock the affected products.</LD>
<TE>   The USDA requires routine testing at meat-processing plants for
salmonella and E. coli bacteria but not listeria. Listeria, which is
common in water and soil, can be tracked into processing plants by
workers and can live in drains and on surfaces for long periods, food
safety experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations for testing for listeria were proposed by the USDA a
year ago but have not been implemented. The rules would require
routine testing for the bacteria, followed by testing of products if
contamination is found.</TE>
<TE>   Without a stricter testing regimen at plants and other procedures
to limit consumer exposure, food safety advocates say, illnesses from
the bacteria could rise, given the popularity of precooked foods and
the spread of listeria in the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be a system of ongoing testing in plants that
produce ready-to-eat products," said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the
Center for Science in the Public Interest. Without testing, she said,
processors can't protect against listeria, "and it can live in plants
a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Cohen, a spokesman for the USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection System, said he did not know when the proposed rules would
take effect. But, he said, testing is no assurance against listeria
outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   Proper plant cleaning and food handling procedures are more
crucial, Cohen said, and more assembly-line inspectors are being
trained to spot problems under a government plan.</TE>
<TE>   There have been three large recalls in the last four years related
to listeria contamination. A recent listeria outbreak in the
Northeast caused at least seven deaths, 46 illnesses and three
miscarriages.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA discovered listeria bacteria at the Pilgrim's Pride plant
when it was investigating the outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   The bacteria were found first in turkey salami, which led last
week to a recall of one day's production. Later inspections
identified the bacteria in other places within the plant, prompting
Sunday's recall.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no illnesses have been linked to products from the
Pilgrim's Pride plant, although turkey cold cuts are a suspected
cause.</TE>
<TE>   The bacteria do not pose a significant health risk to most people,
but can prove deadly for the elderly or those with compromised immune
systems. Listeriosis has killed a greater percentage of those
sickened than have E. coli  bacteria, health officials say.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 people die in the U.S. each year from listeriosis, and
most are sickened by eating deli meat, hot dogs, smoked salmon and
unpasteurized soft cheeses containing the listeria bacteria.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Denies Ethics Violations in Rite Aid Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Voreacos</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa</DL>
<LD>HARRISBURG, Pa. -- U.S. prosecutors have denied allegations that they
broke ethics rules by using former Rite Aid Corp. President Timothy
Noonan to make secret recordings of executives accused of accounting
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Noonan taped former Chief Executive Martin Grass and ex-chief
counsel Franklin Brown discussing the government's probe last year of
the third-largest drugstore chain. Grass, Brown and former Chief
Financial Officer Frank Bergonzi were indicted in June on charges of
obstructing justice and accounting fraud that led Rite Aid to restate
$1.6 billion in profit.</LD>
<LD>   Grass and Brown want a judge to bar the six tapes, claiming that
prosecutors unethically used Noonan as a surrogate to question them
when lawyers for both men opposed such interviews. Prosecutors said
in court papers that informants may tape people obstructing justice,
even if they have hired lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   "In these tape-recorded conversations, Grass and Brown provide
graphic evidence of an active, ongoing scheme to obstruct justice,"
First Assistant U.S. Atty. Martin Carlson said in papers filed Oct.
4. "Even though Grass and Brown were represented by counsel, no
ethics violation was occasioned by the government's surreptitious
recording of their conversations."</TE>
<TE>   Carlson said Grass and Brown cannot claim that having lawyers
protected them before the indictment because Pennsylvania ethics
rules don't allow attorneys to further a continuing crime or fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Noonan, 60, resigned in February 2000. Over the next year, he met
with Brown and Bergonzi to thwart the company's internal
investigation and U.S. criminal and civil probes, Carlson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Noonan agreed in March 2001 to help prosecutors. He pleaded guilty
July 10 to concealing the fraud from Rite Aid internal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   He taped five meetings with Brown and one with Brown and Grass,
Carlson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The tapes "reveal the men discussed the submission of false
information to the FBI, the fabrication of contrived explanations for
certain events, the backdating of documents" and the destruction of
the computer that generated them.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Rite Aid boosted its share price by 306%
from 1995 through 1999 by overstating income and understating
expenses. They claim that officers lied about company finances to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, lenders and internal
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Grass, Brown, Bergonzi and a fourth executive charged with
conspiring to obstruct justice, Eric Sorkin, have pleaded not guilty.
Trial is set for March 3.</TE>

<LD>XO Communications Inc. said Forstmann Little &amp; Co. and Telefonos de

for Carl Icahn to gain control of the telephone service provider.</LD>
<LD>   Forstmann Little and Telmex each will pay XO $12.5 million, and
the three companies will forgo any legal claims related to the
abandoned investment agreement. The accord ends a struggle for

<DL></DL>
<LD>Caterpillar Inc., the world's second-biggest maker of heavy-duty
diesel engines, said it would lay off as many as 3,270 workers at
Illinois and Georgia plants that make truck engines because of
slowing demand.</LD>
<LD>   Caterpillar and rivals such as DaimlerChrysler's Detroit Diesel
unit are laying off workers as heavy-truck demand declines because of
tougher U.S. truck-engine pollution rules that took effect this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Orders are falling because trucking companies stocked up with
vehicles with engines that met the previous rules because of concerns
about the new engines' cost and reliability.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar fell 87 cents to $35.71
on the NYSE. The layoffs were announced after the close of regular
U.S. trading.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quintiles Transnational Corp., which provides testing services to
drug makers, said a group led by its chairman has offered to buy the
company for $1.34 billion in cash.</LD>
<LD>   The bid of $11.25 a share represents a 35% premium on Quintiles'
closing stock price Friday, but analysts said it was too low and did
not reflect the company's long-term prospects.</LD>
<LD>   The offer came from a new company co-owned by Quintiles Chairman
Dennis Gillings. Analysts said the bid reflected growing pressure on
pharmaceutical services companies amid a slowdown in drug approvals
by the Food and Drug Administration and renewed uncertainties as the
drug industry consolidates.</LD>
<TE>   Quintiles' shares rose $1.65 to $9.96 on Nasdaq.</TE>

of 60 cents.</LD>

<LD>Maytag Corp., the No. 3 U.S. appliance maker, said it had
third-quarter net income of $60.8 million as the company cut expenses
and sold a distribution center.</LD>
<LD>   It posted per-share net income of 77 cents, contrasted with a net
loss of $29.7 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
rose 3.1% to $1.17 billion, the maker of Hoover vacuums and Amana
refrigerators said.</LD>
<LD>   Maytag expects fourth-quarter profit excluding certain costs to be
60 cents a share. That's less than the 62-cent average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Newton, Iowa-based Maytag fell 81 cents to $20.57 on the

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GlaxoSmithKline is facing new allegations in an antitrust lawsuit by
an AIDS group that is challenging the lack of generic competition for
the company's two HIV drugs.</LD>
<LD>   AIDS Healthcare Foundation added allegations concerning the drugs
to an antitrust lawsuit it filed in July in Los Angeles. The group
alleges that Glaxo lied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office when
it sought a patent on Retrovir, known as AZT and a key ingredient in
both drugs. The lawsuit says Glaxo didn't invent AZT nor did it
conduct the research showing AZT's use in fighting the human
immunodeficiency virus.</LD>
<LD>   "We've never claimed to have invented AZT," said a Glaxo
spokeswoman. Scientists with a Glaxo predecessor "identified its use
in the treatment of AIDS."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressplay, an online music venture jointly owned by the music
divisions of Sony Corp. and Vivendi Universal, said it has licensed
songs from a fourth major record company: BMG, one of the three
labels that co-own rival online venture MusicNet. Terms were not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The deal leaves Pressplay without music from only one major record
company, AOL Time Warner subsidiary Warner Music Group.</LD>
<LD>   Industry-authorized services such as Pressplay and MusicNet have
struggled to compete with free file-sharing networks such as Kazaa
and Morpheus, on which users can make unauthorized copies of songs
for free.</LD>
<TE>   The only subscription service offering music from all five major
labels is Rhapsody from Listen.com, but unlike Pressplay, Rhapsody
doesn't let users download songs or record them onto CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay executives hope to close that gap by the end of the
year, when they expect to have deals with all five major labels.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanding its presence in cell phones, Intel Corp. introduced a
product that combines the brains and memory of wireless handsets.</LD>
<LD>   As cell phones take on new functions such as games, address book,
e-mail and scheduling, the devices increasingly require more memory
and processing power.</LD>
<LD>   The new Intel chipsets will run as fast as 300 megahertz and have
up to 128 megabytes of storage, enough memory to hold two albums of
compressed digital music, according to Mark Casey, director of
marketing for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's wireless group.</LD>
<TE>   It's the first Intel cell phone processor to stack memory chips
directly on top of a processor. At 1.8 volts, the processor requires
nearly half the power of Intel's previous chips, which helps extend
battery life.</TE>

<LD>Actor Hank Azaria hasn't started shooting his first film, but it's
already been booked on half a million screens.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, they're small screens. But then, it's a short film.</LD>
<LD>   The screens are television sets connected to a TiVo Inc. personal
video recorder, a high-tech version of a VCR. San Jose-based TiVo
recently struck a deal with Standard Film Trust, which produces short
films directed by celebrities, to transmit an undetermined number of
the trust's films to TiVo recorders.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, films such as Azaria's will be delivered
electronically to every home with a TiVo. And although no one will be
forced to watch the films, their placement on TiVo's main on-screen
menu will make them hard to miss.</TE>
<TE>   The deal illustrates how digital technology is opening new routes
to the TV set for filmmakers, programmers and advertisers. Instead of
having to win airtime from a broadcast or cable network, Los
Angeles-based Standard Film Trust is using TiVo to beam its products
directly into consumers' living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Along the same lines, TiVo's main rival, Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Sonicblue, offers a video pipeline from the Web to TV sets through
its latest ReplayTV models. And other companies are providing a new
outlet for programs through cable or Internet video-on-demand
services.</TE>
<TE>   The drawback for these digital alternatives is that they don't
reach the masses. Well under a million homes have a TiVo or Replay
PVR. Cable video-on-demand services are in their infancy, available
to a small fraction of their customers. And a host of Web-based
programmers have withered and died for lack of a high-quality pathway
to TV sets.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo's numbers -- about 500,000 subscribers and more than 1
million viewers, according to company executives -- are small by TV
broadcasting standards. But most of its customers fall into a
demographic group coveted by advertisers: affluent, gadget-hungry TV
lovers.</TE>
<TE>   To deliver something directly to customers' recorders, TiVo
arranges for a national network such as the Discovery Channel to
broadcast the program late at night. It then sends instructions
electronically to every TiVo, commanding the devices to tune to that
channel at the appropriate time and record the program.</TE>
<TE>   For the dozen or so films it produced in its first four years,
Standard Film Trust lined up supporters within the movie business who
were repaid with product placements or credits in the film, founder
Robert Bauer said. The deal with TiVo enables the group to sell
sponsorships to a new set of companies, such as manufacturers and
retailers eager to reach TiVo owners.</TE>
<TE>   Many broadcasting executives put a different, more fearful spin on
the changes caused by the new devices, which make it simple for
consumers to fast-forward through commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The most vocal doomsayer has been Jamie Kellner, chief executive
of AOL Time Warner Inc. subsidiary Turner Broadcasting System, who
has likened skipping commercials to stealing.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo has done a number of distribution deals with retailers,
carmakers and music companies, but the latest one is a bit of a
departure, Chief Executive Michael Ramsey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we've done up to now on showcases has been largely
with a promotional slant to it," he said. "It's to sell something,
whether it's a movie or an album or a gadget.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing with the Standard Film Trust is really more in
the category of content delivery. It's getting interesting and
compelling content to TiVo viewers that wouldn't ordinarily make it
over the airwaves."</TE>
<TE>   Such exclusive programming is important to TiVo, Ramsey said,
because it sets TiVo apart from its competition and helps justify the
monthly service fee. It also may generate some revenue for TiVo, but
not right away, Ramsey added.</TE>
<TE>   The Azaria film, a romantic comedy about a guy trying to decide
whether to marry his girlfriend, is slated to start production in
December.</TE>

<HD>Waksal Is Expected to Plead Guilty, Source Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Devlin Barrett</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Samuel D. Waksal, the founder and former CEO of ImClone Systems Inc.
and a friend of Martha Stewart, is expected to plead guilty today to
multiple charges in the company's insider trading case, a law
enforcement source told the Associated Press on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Waksal faces federal charges of securities fraud, perjury, bank
fraud and obstruction of justice.</LD>
<LD>   The source, who requested anonymity, would not say to which
charges Waksal was to plead guilty.</LD>
<TE>   Waksal spokesman Scott Tagliarino, reached at his Connecticut home
Monday night, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The former CEO was arrested June 12 on charges of trying to sell
his ImClone shares and tipping off friends and family members after
learning that the Food and Drug Administration would reject his
company's experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   He was indicted in August and has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, an ImClone investor, sold almost 4,000 shares in the
biotech company a day before the FDA's announcement in December that
it would not approve the drug. That announcement caused ImClone's
stock price to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has maintained that she had a prearranged order with her
stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, who was also Waksal's broker, to sell
her shares if the stock dropped below a certain price.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant to Bacanovic at Merrill Lynch, Douglas Faneuil,
pleaded guilty this month to a misdemeanor charge of taking a payoff
to keep quiet about Stewart's sale of her shares.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his plea, Faneuil agreed to testify against Stewart and
others if they are charged in connection with the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the
most serious charge, bank fraud.</TE>

<HD>Stock Losses Boost Premiums, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Insurers raise rates to cover shrinking returns, consumer
group says. Firms blame large claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far more than they publicly admit, home and auto insurers are raising
rates to cover their losses on risky corporate securities, according
to a controversial study to be released today by a Santa Monica
consumer watchdog group.</LD>
<LD>   The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said that in 1998,
with the bull market still roaring ahead, the insurance companies
covered in its study held 48% of their investments in stocks and
corporate bonds. By 2001, when the market had turned, corporate
stocks and bonds had climbed to 57% of the insurers' portfolios,
including major stakes in now notorious companies such as Enron Corp.
and WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Heller, a senior consumer advocate for the group, said
insurers built up their emergency reserves and fought for market
share in the 1990s as they enjoyed the fruits of the bull market. But
when their investments soured, "they came back and demanded that
policyholders make up the difference."</LD>
<TE>   "So the average consumer got hit twice," Heller said. "First as
their own 401(k)s shriveled up, and then again to make up for
insurance companies' losses."</TE>
<TE>   Industry leaders called that scenario misleading, contending
investment returns play only a minor role in setting rates compared
with underlying loss trends.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just stunt stuff," said Jeffrey Beyer, a spokesman for
Farmers Group in Los Angeles. "It's irresponsibly misleading to the
average consumer trying to figure out what's actually going on."</TE>
<TE>   Beyer said Farmers' entire stock holdings -- $500 million of a
$12-billion investment portfolio -- equal the company's $500-million
loss on operations for the first half of this year in Texas, where it
has been hit hard by claims related to mold. A $60-million investment
loss cited in the study is "infinitesimal" compared with Farmers'
losses on claims, Beyer said.</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of this year, the nation's property and
casualty insurers suffered $8.6 billion in paper losses on
investments, according to the Insurance Services Office, which tracks
the industry's returns. Those still-unrealized losses eclipsed the
industry's reported profit of $4.6 billion during the first half of
2001, the ISO said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry leaders say the investment losses are less significant
than rising claim expenses, which caused the property-and-casualty
business to lose $7.9 billion last year, the ISO said. Those losses,
and a projected $40 billion in claims from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, are why rates are climbing after remaining stable or
declining for most of the 1990s, industry officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The watchdog group is headed by Harvey Rosenfield, author of a
successful 1988 voter initiative that sought to rein in insurance
prices. The recent spike in premiums -- some homeowner rates have
climbed 50% over the last year -- prompted the group to review
investment records of 10 major property and casualty insurers,
including State Farm Insurance Cos., Allstate Corp. and Farmers.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, the nation's largest personal property and casualty
insurer, lost $60.7 million on WorldCom stock and bonds, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a cheap shot," said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the
Personal Insurance Federation, a trade group that represents State
Farm and other major insurers. "Until three years ago, investments in
corporate bonds weren't considered radical. They were considered the
safest things in the world."</TE>
<TE>   State Farm's loss on WorldCom securities represented a small piece
of its investment portfolio. It invests $37 billion to $45 billion
annually.</TE>

<HD>A Lethal Absence of Hope</HD>
<DH>L.A. must peer into the true cause of its gang killings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory J. Boyle</AU>
<BD>Gregory J. Boyle is a Jesuit priest and executive
director of Homeboy Industries.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronny was killed in February. He was 19, a Marine just returned from
Afghanistan and on a weekend pass from Camp Pendleton. He was not a
gang member, though his older brother, Angel, was. Angel was one of
our first workers at Homeboy Silkscreen and managed to graduate from
high school.</LD>
<LD>   Outside his mother's Boyle Heights home, gang members asked Ronny,
"Where you from?" He answered, "Nowhere," the traditional response
meaning one is a member of no gang. Perhaps then he was going to say,
"The Marines." They killed him before he could say more.</LD>
<LD>   Ronny's mother, Soledad, in the months after her son's death,
found it increasingly difficult to free herself from the grip of this
dark force. She wore only black clothes and quit her job, and even
the recent birth of Ronny's daughter could not extricate her from her
state of constant mourning. Until the morning of Sept. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Soledad woke up, looked in the mirror, decided to return to work,
never wear black clothes again and, for the first time in seven
months, put on makeup. Angel told her how beautiful she looked,
hugged her and said, "It's about time."</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening, as Angel was sitting on the front porch
escaping the heat of the house, a car passed, caught sight of him and
aimed. Several bullets found his head.</TE>
<TE>   When I arrived at the house, I found Soledad slumped in a chair.
Forget the handkerchief. She was sobbing into a bath towel. We talked
and cried together. And my arms felt too short to wrap around her
pain.</TE>
<TE>   I buried Angel last month.</TE>
<TE>   Gang violence is always about something else. The trick, of
course, is to find the "something else."</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 people have been killed on our streets because of
gang violence. The rate of gang-related homicides in the Los Angeles
Police Department's Hollenbeck Division has already exceeded last
year's. Surely contending with gang violence will be at the top of
the agenda of the new Los Angeles police chief.</TE>
<TE>   What do we know to be true about gang violence? We know we will
fail if we fixate on the symptoms and not address what undergirds it.
You can't reason with gang violence; you can't talk to it, sit it at
the table and negotiate with it.</TE>
<TE>   It's akin to 19th century medical professionals staring at vexing
diseases, unable to find their cure. Then, quite inadvertently, the
sewer system and the water supply were addressed and diseases started
to disappear. It turned out the diseases were about "something else."</TE>
<TE>   The new police chief will need to keep officers in our communities
for a longer period than we're used to. Knowledge of our streets and
the people who live there would seem to be the only way to provide a
"police service" that keeps us safe. But that alone would not locate
the roots of such violence, which is necessary to reverse this
alarming trend.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators seek, often enough, to create laws that they hope will
cause gang members to "think twice" before committing crimes.
Deterrence has never worked with those who have ceased to care.
Moreover, the gulf that separates us from each other only widens when
we see gang members as foreign, "the other," "them."</TE>
<TE>   Recent Times editorials on gangs seem incapable of not using the
word "thug," heightening the use of the language that demonizes. This
is never helpful because we then soon forget that we belong to each
other. Forgetting this keeps us distant from real solutions.</TE>
<TE>   I once sat on a grandstand next to Boston Celtic great Bob Cousy.
He said to me, quite simply, "Kids join gangs when they've been
denied their hope." Not bad. None of us ought to expect the new LAPD
chief to manufacture hope in our poorest communities. That's not his
job; it's ours. We know what the "something else" is; we need only
find the will to do something about it.</TE>

<HD>Psychopath or Terrorist, Sniper Lusts for Power</HD>
<DH>Don't let the serial killer win; go on with daily life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Kellerman</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kellerman is a novelist and psychologist. His
newly published novel is "The Murder Book" (Ballantine Books).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the essence of fear: You are weeding the lawn, walking your
beautiful child to school, strolling with your recalcitrant dog,
filling your car up with gas. It's a day like any other until the
shot rings out, and someone who was here a second ago isn't.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, you may venture out. Or, you may listen to the
pounding of your heart and leave the lawn unweeded / keep your child
home / permit the dog his panting indolence / allow the gas gauge
needle to veer toward empty. The Washington-area sniper knows this
well, and he's grinning ear to ear. Because whether his murders shake
out as the work of an apolitical psychopath or as part of a
post-Sept. 11 terror plan, they're based on one primary motive: power
lust.</LD>
<LD>   Serial killing is a crime of sadistic domination. Most often, it's
sexually mediated domination, but sometimes the sexual kink is
camouflaged by polemics. Witness the Unabomber's attempt to justify
his crimes as ecological heroism -- a farce accepted all too easily
by some naive environmentalists. A cursory reading of Theodore
Kaczynski's ramblings reveal him to have been a classic loser, unable
to form normal human relationships, who was motivated by the sheer,
vicious joy of killing.</LD>
<TE>   Political terrorism appears, at first glance, to spring from a
different set of psychosocial circumstances. But a close examination
of terrorism reveals more than a bit of similarity to garden-variety
serial homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden and his ilk believe themselves aggrieved by
Western culture. This is nothing new. Political and religious
tensions are a given in a heterogeneous world. But most aggrieved
parties don't resort to the murder of innocents misrepresented as
martyrdom to achieve their ends. In fact, terrorist tactics have been
relatively ineffective in achieving large-scale political change as
the world continues to be molded by formalized warfare and diplomacy.
As armies and bureaucrats prevail, self-immolating lunatics are
shunted to obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, they keep trying.</TE>
<TE>   One must look past the rhetoric, then, and examine terrorist
fantasies to understand what strapping on an explosives belt and
pulling the little white strings really means. The recruiters of
Hamas and other groups know what it means. They ply impressionable,
disenfranchised young people with visions of Paradise Awaiting.
Sacrifice yourself for the Cause and you will inherit a nirvanic
afterlife complete with virgins on demand. This is sexual imagery at
its ripest, and it works.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist tutors never strap on bomb belts themselves,
however. Like the Washington sniper, they remain safe and concealed,
orchestrating murder from afar. Because the cold heart of terrorism
isn't fueled by self-determination or liberation. Its rhythm is
nourished by calculated hatred and a thirst for power, by the
opportunity to experience a titanic sense of control, however
passing.</TE>
<TE>   That level of gratification is habit-forming. So the bombs keep
exploding, and the sniper keeps firing. Sniping is well established
as a terrorist method. Much media attention has been paid to the
bloody work of Palestinian suicide bombers but very little has been
cast upon another, simultaneous tactic employed by the same terrorist
organizations that choreograph intifadas: sniper shootings -- the
most infamous example being that of an infant girl sighted in a
Palestinian rifleman's cross hairs and shot in the head.</TE>
<TE>   The primacy of suicide bombing over sniping as a topic of news
coverage stems from the fact that successful bombings kill, maim and
traumatize large groups of victims in one swoop, whereas sniper
shootings tend to pick off one or two innocents at a time. One
becomes a big story, the other is dismissed as ho-hum Mideast
violence. But that's true only when the sniping occurs 10,000 miles
away. When the victims live in Virginia, it's a very big story,
indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-area sniper would have merited plenty of newsprint
and TV time in any age, but in the post-Sept. 11 era, his crimes have
acquired additional emotional valence. Because we Americans now know
that the world isn't nearly as friendly as we deluded ourselves into
believing. The anthrax murders reinforced that attitude adjustment
and the sniper has nurtured it further. Armies and diplomats may mold
nations but bad guys lurking in the shadows maim our consciousness
and threaten to deform our daily lives.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the sniper turns out to be a homegrown demon or a minion
of the elusive Bin Laden matters little. He boils with hatred and
power lust but is smart enough to keep all that in check until he
returns home to gloat. Until he is caught, he will continue to ply
his malignant trade because it makes him feel important. If we stop
weeding the lawn, he will have won. If we obsess about him, he will
have won. If, on the other hand, we pursue him without elevating him
to mythic proportions while venturing out bravely and living our
humdrum lives -- much as everyday Israelis struggle to live theirs --
we will, ultimately, rob him of his pleasure.</TE>

<HD>Politics and TV Can Mix</HD>
<DH>Faulty surveys are one reason for lack of coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Rosenstiel and Dave Iverson</AU>
<BD>Tom Rosenstiel is director of the Project for
Excellence in Journalism. Dave Iverson is director of Best Practices
in Journalism. Both groups are funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an uneasy time, just one thing about this November's elections can
be reliably predicted. Until election night, the primary medium by
which Americans get news -- local television -- will mostly ignore
the political campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of a few stations, this has become so standard
that most Americans don't even consider local TV news a place to
learn about politics. The consequence is that as voters know less
about whom to vote for and why, advertising becomes even more central
to elections and governing suffers.</LD>
<LD>   Why has this happened?</LD>
<TE>   The biggest reason is an accepted wisdom in television: Covering
politics is an audience loser, a sure way to wind up at the bottom of
the ratings heap. Are local broadcasters right? Do people really not
care?</TE>
<TE>   Much of the thinking about political coverage in local television
traditionally has been based on the recommendations of TV consultants
who help steer many local newsrooms toward the stories and story
approaches they believe audiences want. They base their
recommendations on audience surveys. And herein lies the problem.</TE>
<TE>   A standard survey from one of the nation's major television
consulting firms -- typical of those used industrywide -- has plenty
of targeted questions on whether audiences want specific types of
consumer news, including everything from where to shop to how to
avoid getting ripped off. There are also questions to gauge interest
in topics from parenting tips to pet care.</TE>
<TE>   But the question about politics is put as follows: "How interested
are you in news reports about issues and activities in government and
politics?"</TE>
<TE>   The less specific the question, the less useful the answer,
according to polling professionals. In this case, the question was so
general it was meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   What would happen if the questions about politics were framed as
specifically as those about pet care?</TE>
<TE>   The Pew Research Center conducted a nationwide poll that included
the standard consultant question on politics. Only 29% said they'd be
very interested in that kind of reporting. Yet when people were asked
whether they'd be interested in "news reports about what government
can do to improve the performance of local schools," the percentage
of "very interested" jumped to 59%. Similarly, when participants were
asked whether they'd be interested in reports on what government
could do to ensure that public places were safe from terrorism, the
percentage of "very interested" rose to 67%.</TE>
<TE>   Similar interest-level percentages were tallied for stories about
reducing health-care costs. All of these topics, from schools to
health care to public safety, have everything to do with politics and
government.</TE>
<TE>   This experiment in research methods suggests at least two lessons.</TE>
<TE>   First, the research that has dominated TV consulting about
covering public life is faulty. The standard questions on politics,
at least from this consulting firm, were not social science as much
as self-fulfilling prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the reframed questions offer a guide for TV journalists
about how to make stories about public life more relevant and more
popular. They should frame the issue in a way that is relevant to
people's lives -- how the issue affects their schools, their health,
their safety -- and then connect the dots between the problems that
people wrestle with and what government might do to be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists need to focus on people and their problems, not
politicians and theirs. When local television news does that, the
results can be striking. As ratings for local TV news now are falling
generally, setting aside old-style consulting and doubtful research
probably are key to navigating an increasingly difficult future.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indonesia has long been willing to unleash security forces to fight
separatist movements, but it has ignored the danger from radical
Muslim groups inside its borders. A deadly weekend bombing that
killed perhaps 200 young and mostly foreign clubgoers on the island
of Bali should finally force Indonesia to unblinker itself and sign
on to the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Indonesia's defense minister said Monday that the Bali explosion
was "linked to Al Qaeda" and to "local terrorists." Those are
reasonable assumptions, although no group claimed responsibility for
the car-bombing Saturday outside a popular Bali nightspot. Most of
the victims were tourists, drawn to Bali by its splendid beaches,
good surfing and inexpensive hotels. Until last weekend, it also had
a reputation for peace and safety.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Asian officials said Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda had
established cells in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim
nation, even before 9/11. After those attacks, the sprawling
archipelago became a still more tempting sanctuary for Islamic
radicals fleeing Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The government of Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri is
weak, and law enforcement often is ineffective, especially where
local police and soldiers sympathize with Muslim radicals. The
government's excuse that it lacks laws to crack down on terrorism is
feeble but politically convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern is the Jemaah Islamiah group and its leader,
Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir. Although Bashir denied responsibility
for the Bali attack, officials in nearby Singapore said last month
that Jemaah Islamiah cells in their island nation had conducted
surveillance of numerous potential targets, including the U.S.
Embassy, which they planned to blow up with truck bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore, Malaysia and the United States had warned Indonesia of
the threat from Bashir's group, but Jakarta has taken a hands-off
attitude for fear of antagonizing Muslim fundamentalists. Singapore
officials say Jemaah Islamiah is the core of an alliance of
extremists planning terror attacks to achieve an Islamic state
spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and parts of the
Philippines and Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the terror was evident Monday. The U.S. Embassy
ordered nonessential personnel to leave the country, and tourists
fled Bali, which will certainly be economically devastated by the
exodus. Australian and U.S. investigators flew to the island;
Megawati's government should coordinate their efforts with its own.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of repressive military-backed rule and appalling
human rights violations, Indonesia has been moving toward democracy.
It can balance a war on terrorism and respect for individual rights.
But it cannot look the other way while Al Qaeda and affiliated groups
entrench. That echoes Afghanistan, risking similar results unless the
government wakes up.</TE>

<KH>ELECTION RECOMMENDATIONS</KH>
<HD>Davis for Reelection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has been a long, dreary election campaign for governor. Neither
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis nor Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr.
inspires much good feeling. Davis' obsessive pursuit of every last
campaign dollar from special interests is unseemly, and the governor
has been slow to grasp the lead on critical issues. But Simon's
campaign has been one amateurish gaffe and disaster after another,
and his proposed solutions to major state problems are shallow and
naive. The choice is clear: Davis is the only candidate with the
experience and knowledge of government needed to serve as the state's
chief executive. The Times endorses Davis for reelection to a second
term Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Davis is aloof. He agonizes over minor decisions most governors
would leave to aides. He is robotic and largely humorless. He's often
at war with the Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   But, as Davis says, California has lots of glamorous and exciting
characters. What the state needs in a governor is experience and the
ability to guide the state to solid policy decisions. And Davis'
positions on key issues such as the environment, work and family, and
gun control are more in tune with a majority of Californians than are
those of Simon.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's constant campaign stumbles -- most notably, his hasty and
erroneous claim that Davis broke the law by accepting a campaign
check in his state office -- raise questions about the Republican
candidate's ability to organize and run a complex state
administration. The incident undermined the value of his experience
as a federal prosecutor. And Simon's claim that he was a successful
businessman was eroded by a stream of stories about reverses in
family businesses.</TE>
<TE>   That the Republicans are saddled with a Simon candidacy is a
reflection of conservative dominance of the California Republican
Party. Simon defeated the moderate Richard Riordan, former Los
Angeles mayor, in part because Davis trashed Riordan with negative
ads during the primary campaign, but also because some state party
members undermined the more moderate Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   On key state policy matters, Simon mechanically rattles off what
appear to be memorized statements produced by a think tank. Simon
claimed he had a plan to solve the state's $24-billion budget deficit
problem this year, but it just didn't add up.</TE>
<TE>   Simon complained that new-home sale prices included $30,000 in
fees, largely caused by bureaucratic paperwork. In fact, the fees pay
for streets, sewers, parks, schools and other facilities -- things
local governments can't finance because Proposition 13 decimated
their property tax bases.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest beef most Californians have with Davis is over his
handling of the electric power crisis of 2001. Davis should have
acted sooner, but in the end he patched together an energy structure
that kept the power flowing to California homes and businesses. In a
second and final term, the governor should have far more time to
devote to major state needs and should drop the perpetual
fund-raising that so detracted from his first term. He needs to be a
leader in finding solutions to problems such as the crisis in
emergency and trauma health care, the state's continuing budget
crisis, the ongoing struggle to keep California business on an even
keel and the need for water, transportation, education and other
facilities to cope with California's growth.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Simon, Davis does not need on-the-job training to be
governor of the most populous state. California should be the
beneficiary of a Davis focused not on fund-raising but on creating a
legacy of leadership based on getting out ahead on California's
significant challenges. The Times endorses Gray Davis for reelection.</TE>

<LD>Proposition 48 asks Californians to do a bit of constitutional
housekeeping. Since voters passed Proposition 220 in 1998, state
municipal courts have ceased to exist and all the judges who were on
those benches have been elevated to the superior courts.</LD>
<LD>   This consolidation of the state's municipal and superior courts,
now a reality in all 58 counties, helps trial courts run more
efficiently, eliminates duplication of services and saves tax money.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 48 would tidy up the last loose ends from this trial
court merger by deleting references in the California Constitution to
municipal courts and municipal court judges. These references, like
those specifying who can be a municipal court judge, are obsolete
since neither the municipal courts nor its judges exist anymore.</LD>
<TE>   The California Law Revision Commission, which backed the trial
court merger, recommended that the Legislature put this measure
before the voters.</TE>
<TE>   In legislative lingo, Proposition 48 makes "conforming and
technical changes" to the Constitution; what it means is dotting the
i's and crossing the last t on changes that California voters made
four years ago. It's an easy "yes" vote.</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Blamed for Bali Bombing</HD>
<DH>Indonesia's defense minister says Bin Laden's group worked
with local terrorists to blow up clubs popular with Westerners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A car bomb that killed at least 188 people on the island of Bali was
the work of the Al Qaeda network with help from home-grown
terrorists, Indonesia's defense minister said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   As investigators from the United States, Australia and Indonesia
searched for clues in the rubble of a popular nightclub district,
Defense Minister Matori Abdul Jalil told reporters there was no
question that Osama bin Laden's group was behind the blast. Until
now, the government had resisted the idea that Al Qaeda might be
operating in Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic country.</LD>
<LD>   "We are sure Al Qaeda is here," Matori said after attending a
Cabinet meeting in Jakarta, the capital. "The Bali bomb blast is
linked to Al Qaeda with the cooperation of local terrorists."</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush said he also believes Al Qaeda was
behind the bombing and cited a series of attacks this month: the Bali
bombing, a shooting attack on American troops in Kuwait and the
bombing of a French tanker in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the attack on the French vessel was a terrorist
attack," Bush told reporters before departing on a campaign swing
that will take him to about 15 states in the next three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the attack on our Marines in Kuwait was a terrorist
attack. The attack in Bali appears to be an Al Qaeda-type terrorist
-- definitely a terrorist attack, whether it's Al Qaeda-related or
not -- I would assume it is. And therefore, it does look like a
pattern of attacks that the enemy, albeit on the run, is trying to
once again frighten and kill freedom-loving people. And we've just
got to understand, we are in a long struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely determined now, as I was a year ago, to continue
to rout out these people, to find them, to use the best intelligence
we can and to bring them to justice. And we will continue to pursue
[them]."</TE>
<TE>   Police have provided few details of their investigation into the
Saturday night blast, which demolished the crowded Sari Club and
destroyed dozens of other buildings in the Kuta beach district.
Officials did say that the type of attack and the power of the
explosives were similar to a bombing in Jakarta two years ago
allegedly carried out by Jemaah Islamiah, a Southeast Asian extremist
group associated with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   One Western expert said the attack appeared to be a very
sophisticated operation, in contrast to most previous terrorist
attacks in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the attacks cited by Bush, the Bali bombing follows
closely the release of statements attributed to Bin Laden and his
chief deputy. The timing raised fears among some officials that Al
Qaeda was regrouping.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the administration was making progress, but added, "This
is a long war, and it's going to take awhile to fully rout Al Qaeda.
We don't know whether Bin Laden is alive or dead.... We do know that
Al Qaeda is still dangerous. And while we've made good progress,
there's a lot more work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 500 people were injured in the Bali explosion. At least two
Americans were killed and three wounded. Most of the dead were
foreigners, with the largest number from Australia. Officials in
Australia expect the death toll of Australians to be the highest in
any incident since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, nearly all of the wounded foreigners had been
evacuated. Since Saturday night, tourists have thronged the airport,
seeking to cut their vacations short and leave the island.</TE>
<TE>   Matori's comments marked the first time that a top Indonesian
government official has implicated the Al Qaeda network in the Bali
blast or in any other terrorist act in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there is a link between Al Qaeda and what happened in
Bali," the minister said. "This incident convinces me that the
network exists in Indonesia."</TE>
<TE>   British officials said that as many as 33 Britons were killed in
the bombing. In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain must
do everything it can to "eradicate this evil in our world."</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult because, as the events in Bali showed, they will
strike anywhere, anytime, at any place, and they really do not care
how many innocent people they kill," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to Parliament, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said
the Australian government would call on the United Nations to list
Jemaah Islamiah as a terrorist organization and said there was
evidence he did not disclose linking the group to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush said, "Clearly it's a deliberate attack on
citizens who love freedom, citizens from countries which embrace
freedom. They're trying to intimidate us, and we won't be
intimidated."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also believe that Al Qaeda works closely in
Southeast Asia with Jemaah Islamiah, which allegedly is headed by
Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has repeatedly denied any involvement in terrorist
activity, and the Indonesian government has said it does not have
sufficient evidence to arrest him. At a news conference Monday, he
again insisted all of the charges were false.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Jemaah Islamiah members have been jailed in Singapore
and Malaysia for plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other
targets in Singapore last year. Members of the group also are
believed to have met with two of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Malaysia
in early 2000. Several members trained in Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir says he had nothing to do with the Bali bombing and
suggested it was staged by the United States and its allies to
justify allegations that Indonesia is a base for terrorists. U.S.
officials dismissed his claim as "totally false."</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's national police spokesman, Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, said
police were examining similarities between the Bali explosion and a
bombing in Jakarta two years ago that severely injured Leonides
Caday, the Philippine ambassador to Indonesia. Police say that blast,
which killed several bystanders, was carried out by members of Jemaah
Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on our observations, they are similar -- from the impact
they caused, the power of the bombs, the damage and the craters they
left," Saaf said. "There is a possibility that the explosive they
used is the same, C4 and TNT."</TE>
<TE>   Saaf said both bombs were detonated by remote control, making it
possible for the attackers to control the precise moment of the
blast.</TE>
<TE>   It is too early to tell whether any of the same people were
involved, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two top members of Jemaah Islamiah involved in the blast at the
Philippine Embassy in Jakarta -- Faiz bin Abu Bakar Bafana, a
Malaysian, and Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, an Indonesian -- have since
been arrested for their role in a plot to attack seven targets in
Singapore with suicide truck bombs. Police say both men also
organized bombings in Manila in 2000 that killed 22 people.</TE>
<TE>   Jemaah Islamiah's top operations leader, Indonesian cleric Riduan
Isamuddin, remains at large. Known as Hambali, he is a close
associate of Bashir and allegedly has been involved in terrorist
attacks that have killed dozens of people over the last seven years.
He is believed to be a liaison with Al Qaeda. Some suspect that he
was involved in the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   One Western security expert said the Bali bombing showed planning
and sophistication far greater than in most of the terrorist attacks
that have taken place in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The bombers selected their target carefully -- a crowded street
with two nightclubs that were magnets for foreign tourists. They
chose a time when the explosion would kill the greatest number of
foreigners, a little past 11 on a Saturday night when the clubs were
always packed.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was deliberate to cause maximum damage," said the
security expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "That's a major
departure from anything we have seen, aside from the bombing of the
Philippines ambassador. This is a world-scale terrorist incident."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department, fearing that the terrorists are
planning additional attacks, ordered all nonessential personnel and
embassy family members to leave Indonesia. The department also urged
all Americans who are in the country to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's chief security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
warned that terrorists may be planning attacks against important
industrial facilities, including a Caltex refinery on Sumatra and a
liquefied natural gas plant run by ExxonMobil in Aceh, in the
island's north.</TE>
<TE>   "The government declares enough is enough," the former general
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Vice President Hamzah Haz, who once dined with Bashir and
once declared that there were no terrorists in Indonesia, changed his
tune. "Whoever engages in terror," Haz said, "whether a commoner, an
official or an ulema [Islamic scholar], we will not protect them."</TE>

<HD>For Iraqis, Vote for Hussein Is an Exercise in Democracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Veteran high school history teacher Saladin Fadahl proudly sports a
Saddam Hussein pin on his shirt pocket and wants the whole world to
know that he loves his president very dearly.</LD>
<LD>   Going even further, Ahmed Abdul Latif, 30, said he wants the world
to know that Iraq is a democracy and not the dictatorship that
President Bush has made it out to be. It is a place where everyone is
free -- free "to show love for the president."</LD>
<LD>   They are among the 11 million eligible voters who will be asked to
demonstrate that love by casting their ballots today in support of
Hussein's leadership -- or against it. Officials are very serious
about the referendum and hopeful it will spread a message around the
world that Iraqis choose to live under an iron fist.</LD>
<TE>   Of course the outcome is preordained. But then, so is Western
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I know in the West, maybe it does not mean anything," said Saad
Naji Jawad, a political science professor at Baghdad University.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats and academics said many Iraqis sincerely believe
an overwhelming yes vote will show popular support for keeping
Hussein in power. The referendum also serves to rally the public at a
time when war with the United States appears ever more likely.</TE>
<TE>   "In their view they will show the world they are in unity," one
European diplomat said. But outside of Iraq, "everybody will laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Internally, the results can be used to identify any pockets of
resistance. Authorities, for example, will be keeping close watch on
the low-income neighborhood of Saddam Hussein City, where most of the
residents are Shiite Muslims. The country is ruled by minority Sunni
Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "What they fear most now is domestic unrest," said a European
diplomat. "They need to feel and look unified."</TE>
<TE>   Unity is the goal, but at the moment, analysts say, there is a
division within the Hussein government. One faction argues that the
U.S. will attack no matter what Iraq does, so more military
preparations are needed. The other group believes a war still can be
stopped, so all diplomatic efforts should be pursued.</TE>
<TE>   The government is taking steps to address the concerns of both
camps, diplomats said. For the hard-liners, the government has
distributed weapons to tribe members and has created a special
security force to protect the president. It is making it difficult
for draft-age men, doctors and engineers to travel abroad and it has
tried to smooth over relations with religious leaders. The other camp
is hoping the referendum will convince the world that Iraq is not
interested in a change in regime and that a strong showing will give
Hussein more legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   How Iraqis truly feel is anybody's guess. It is not permitted to
put up posters that would say, for example, "Vote No on Referendum
Day." There are no open debates or forums to discuss the legacy of
Hussein's 30 years in control. No one is talking about the huge sums
the Baath Party initially spent on electrification and education for
the masses, or how the nation's oil wealth was funneled into
disastrous war efforts against Iran and in Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   This is about adulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes to our beloved leader Saddam Hussein. Yes, yes," read
one of the thousands of banners hung from buildings all over this
city. It was decorated with red hearts. Another read: "Our Blood Our
Soul for Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   The referendum is scheduled by law to take place every seven
years. During the last vote, held in 1995, Hussein garnered a
whopping 99.96% -- a victory that was so one-sided it undermined the
very message of democratic participation and widespread support
organizers had hoped it would deliver. This time, hundreds of
journalists, routinely denied visas, have been allowed in to report
on the referendum. But a message has been delivered that reentry to
Iraq may depend on how the vote is covered.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, officials said the threat hanging over the Hussein
regime may actually boost support for the president, as Serbs rallied
around then-President Slobodan Milosevic during the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization bombing of Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they hate the regime, they are not looking for America to
save them," said a European diplomat based here.</TE>
<TE>   Another diplomat said Iraqis have never had a democratic system
and, because they are largely isolated from the rest of the world
through restrictions on what they can watch and read, they truly
perceive the referendum as being democratic.</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad Monday, Fadahl and Abdul Latif were getting ready for
the 5,500 registered voters who live along Palestine Street in a
middle-class neighborhood of one- and two-story single-family houses.
The community polling place was the Tagami Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Fadahl proudly showed off the many, many portraits displayed
around the school lobby of the president. One was framed in Christmas
garland. Another in silk flowers. Still another in both.</TE>
<TE>   Fadahl pointed to the ballot box, a white plywood container also
decorated with pictures of the president and silk flowers. He pointed
to the lock on the ballot box and said that a "lawman" will be around
in the morning to make sure it is empty when the day starts and to
make sure the ballots are properly counted.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if anyone voted no in 1995, his reply was no. Asked if
anyone will vote no this time, Fadahl said, "Maybe."</TE>
<TE>   "All our people love our leader," he said.</TE>

<HD>Kenyan Opposition Rallies Against Moi</HD>
<DH>Protesters say longtime president's choice of independence
hero's son as heir is highhanded.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>President Daniel Arap Moi, who has ruled this East African nation for
nearly a quarter century, officially anointed his chosen successor
Monday. Tens of thousands of Kenyans gathered at a rival rally here
to protest his decision.</LD>
<LD>   Moi introduced about 4,000 delegates of his ruling Kenya African
National Union to Uhuru Kenyatta, the 41-year-old son of the
country's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, whom Moi succeeded in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   Moi's decision to handpick a successor has led to open revolt in
KANU and political turmoil in the country. During the last two days,
six government ministers have resigned to protest what they described
as the party's refusal to hold fair elections to select a candidate.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Moi fired his vice president and several other ministers
who refused to back Kenyatta.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyatta grew up in the presidential mansion known as State House.
He was christened Uhuru -- Swahili for freedom -- because he was born
a few weeks after the British released his father, an independence
leader, from prison.</TE>
<TE>   In his acceptance speech, Kenyatta promised to tackle Kenya's
ills, which he said included "high poverty levels, crippling domestic
debt, serious unemployment, HIV/AIDS, poor infrastructure, high and
worsening income inequalities and gender disparities."</TE>
<TE>   He also pledged that the government would be uncompromising in
fighting corruption. Kenya has been named as one of the world's most
corrupt countries, and the World Bank and other institutions have
frozen nearly $300 million in loans until the nation improves its
record of fighting graft.</TE>
<TE>   "We must address this vice as a matter of national urgency," said
Kenyatta, a businessman who helps manage the vast empire inherited
from his father. "The answer lies within all of us, and we must
individually and collectively commit ourselves to combat this
menace."</TE>
<TE>   Kenyatta's promise to tackle corruption met doubt among analysts
and many ordinary Kenyans.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are promoting his candidacy have been the ones
most closely associated with corruption," said Gichira Kibara, who
heads the Center for Governance and Development, a policy research
group.</TE>
<TE>   Kibara and other analysts say Moi, who has described Kenyatta as
someone "who can be guided," wants to remain the power behind the
scenes after his scheduled retirement early next year. By handpicking
Kenyatta, the president and his cronies want to ensure that calls for
them to be prosecuted for allegedly looting the country would go
unheeded, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Kenyatta was being elected unopposed as KANU's
torchbearer, about 30,000 people streamed into Nairobi's Uhuru Park
to hear former government ministers and opposition leaders condemn
Moi.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the speakers, including former Energy Minister Raila
Odinga, had lobbied Moi to let an independent commission oversee the
party's selection of its candidate. Odinga and other candidates who
eventually quit or were fired from Moi's government said the
president's support for Kenyatta made a farce of the election.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not against Uhuru," said Dismas Ouma, a 57-year-old small
businessman who pushed through the large crowd. "But what we don't
like is the system that is being used to promote him."</TE>
<TE>   Local commentators say Kenya's fractious opposition has its best
chance yet to end KANU's long reign. In a country where voters cast
their ballots along ethnic lines, the opposition now promises to
unite leaders of the Kikuyu, Luo and Kisii, among Kenya's largest
ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Moi will try to do all in his power to ensure that the
super-alliance of opposition parties does not materialize," Kibara
said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the terror attack Oct. 12 in Bali, Indonesia, innocent citizens of
France and other European countries were murdered. Given the horrific
scale of this latest attack, one wonders if the Europeans will
continue their accommodating attitudes toward the perpetrators of
terror.</LD>
<LD>   Will they continue self-flagellating teach-ins about the evils of
their own cultures to understand why they are hated? Will they
continue to advocate appeasement of terror thugs in order to entice
Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and the boys from Islamic Jihad to
leave them alone? Will they continue to promote the sacrifice of
Israel (remember the fate of Czechoslovakia in Munich 1938) to curry
popularity with Arab chieftains?</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope for change. Let's hope the Europeans look to America
for guidance. Let's hope the heart and grit and resolve of America
will continue to be a light unto nations.</LD>

<TE>   I am struck by the coincidence of current events and your Sunday
review of Daniel Ellsberg's new book, "Secrets." I am reminded of an
earlier administration's lie that got Congress to commit us to the
Vietnam War. Today's administration tells us of Iraq's ties to Al
Qaeda because of a meeting in Prague, the account of which was later
discredited and never confirmed, and the fact that an Al Qaeda leader
escaped Afghanistan and wound up getting medical aid in Baghdad. Of
course, they tell us there is much more evidence, but they can't
share it with us for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA complains that this administration is pressuring it to
distort intelligence to provide information to back up our
intellectual stampede to war. Our California representatives' mail is
grossly oriented toward restraint, but some of them back the
president. Political polls say we don't want to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld demands that we trust the
members of the administration because they know what they are doing
and we don't and we can't be trusted with information. The new
political correctness is to back the president or you are not
patriotic. Where is the new Ellsberg now that we need him?</TE>

<TE>   I don't understand why you devote so much space on your otherwise
thoughtful editorial page to the Ramirez cartoons. Sunday's cartoon
implying that Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks is
particularly insipid. Al Qaeda terrorists probably despise the idea
of a secular dictator in an Arab country and welcome the coming
bloodbath and installation of an oil puppet in Iraq. It can only help
their cause in the long run, distance the U.S. even more from the
rest of the world and reveal the true intentions of the current
oil-crony regime much more clearly than they ever could.</TE>

<TE>   "The Wrong Resolution" (editorial, Oct. 11) is a dogmatic view
that dismisses a potentially awesome threat to the nation. The very
reason the resolution was passed with strong bipartisan support is
not because the entire Congress has suddenly become aligned with the
president. It passed because Congress came to grips with the stark
realization that restraint could result in a catastrophe for our
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The guiding principle of acting defensively has served our nation
well in the past. During the Cold War we were also shielded by the
deterrent of "mutual assured destruction." This no longer applies.</TE>
<TE>   Congress may have demonstrated wisdom in its decision that current
doctrine in the world of terrorism may be ineffective in protecting
the U.S. from an attack.</TE>

<TE>   In an Oct. 13 letter, a writer posits that a war with Iraq would
result in "thousands of dead Iraqis" and continues, "I am not going
to shed any tears for dead Iraqi civilians." I can only hope that she
is being sarcastic. For how can anyone fail to shed tears for the
dead of any war? Human life is, or should be, very precious, and each
person who dies in a war is a source of grief. It does not matter
whether a person is a soldier or civilian, or what his nationality is
or his religion -- whoever dies in war is one of us. One of the human
race.</TE>

<LD>I was outraged by the article on Roger Lowenstein and his attempts to
subvert young minds under the guise of education ("Making Social
Justice Part of the Curriculum," Oct. 9). We've seen that kind of
education before, provided by people like Pol Pot in Cambodia and Mao
Tse-tung in China. For Lowenstein to claim that he is not pushing
"any particular political agenda" is disingenuous. I wonder how many
hours of the day his students are exposed to the benefits of
capitalism or of a civilian-controlled military. My guess is not many
of the great things about our country would fit into Lowenstein's
political agenda.</LD>
<LD>   His purpose, educating a child to produce the next "Martin Luther
King or Cesar Chavez," is silly. The purpose of education is to teach
children how to think so they can make up their own minds about
issues. To do that, both sides must be put forth without bias. I
don't imagine that happens very often at his Leadership Academy.
Indoctrinating young minds has consequences that we can see very
clearly in places like the Middle East. The really sad part of all
this is that Lowenstein is doing this with our tax dollars. Somebody
should remind him that this is the U.S., not Saudi Arabia.</LD>

<LD>In his letter concerning your article on St. Edward's Church, Eric
Forster asked what spirituality remains in the Catholic Church
without priests (Oct. 7). The church teaches that Christ is present
in the Eucharist, the Scriptures and in the assembly, and not
exclusively in the form of the priest. Forster's theology is not
inaccurate, but it is narrow and decidedly pre-Vatican II.</LD>

<LD>I am puzzled to understand why The Times' writers like Steve Lopez
and Frank del Olmo are so brutal with their columns on incoming LAPD
Chief William Bratton -- unless they want him to fail. The headline
for Del Olmo's Oct. 13 commentary, "Listen Up When Latinos Speak,
Chief Bratton," could be construed as a veiled threat: Do as we say,
or else.</LD>
<LD>   To attack someone without giving him a chance is an abuse of power
and is not what our society is about, or is it? Further, any
officers, Latino or otherwise, who tell themselves that a promotion
isn't worth the hassle do not have the tenacity required of lead
officers and should stay where they are.</LD>

<LD>Re "Falwell Apologizes After Remarks Enrage Muslims," Oct. 13: Every
year the Rev. Jerry Falwell has to issue a public apology for remarks
he has made. In 2001 he apologized for stating that American liberals
invited God's judgment in the Sept. 11 events. Now, in 2002, he has
apologized to Muslims for asserting that Muhammad was a terrorist.
How about a timely apology from the media for lifting Falwell from
the anonymity of his country parsonage in Virginia? Does the right to
free speech include a microphone to millions? Falwell's 2003 apology,
and the remarks that make that apology necessary, could be delivered
solely to the congregation at the Thomas Road Baptist Church.</LD>

<LD>I understand the anger and frustration felt by Peggy Orenstein
(Commentary, Oct. 9) at the fact that breast cancer continues to kill
women (and men), but I disagree with some of the points she makes.
The death rate from breast cancer has been decreasing at a rate of
2.2% per year since 1991. As an oncologist who treats breast cancer
patients and a longtime volunteer for the American Cancer Society, I
am convinced that the decreasing breast cancer death rate is the
result of increased breast cancer awareness and increased funding for
research. Maybe pink ribbons are important; maybe it makes one more
person look up breast health guidelines or gather up pledges for a
walk.</LD>
<LD>   I do agree with Orenstein when she says that people raising money
for walks and runs to fight breast cancer should ask pointed
questions about where the money goes. I've asked those same
questions, and that's why this year, once again, I will be taking
part in the American Cancer Society's Making Strides Against Breast
Cancer 5K walk (on Oct. 20 at the Rose Bowl). The money raised that
day will go toward research, prevention, free patient support
services, early detection education programs and advocacy efforts.
And I'll be wearing a pink ribbon.</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to Orenstein for her provocative and enlightening
commentary. Everyone needs to be made aware of the deceitful
practices she describes, used to solicit funds for the prevention of
breast cancer. An example is chemical companies such as AstraZeneca
and DuPont that, while they are corporate donors, at the same time
manufacture products that are carcinogenic, polluting the environment
and posing the risk of breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Women also need to know the facts about the efficacy of mammograms
and breast self-examination. Both fall short in regard to the
detection of breast cancer and survival rates. Along with better
diagnostic techniques, Orenstein points to the need for improvement
in treatment beyond the standard forms -- namely, surgery, radiation
and chemotherapy, which she labels "slash, burn and poison."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Orenstein for her insistence that profits from
"awareness" donations be used to ensure better detection and
treatment of breast cancer.</TE>

<TE>   For many, many years I have been saying to people that the
deplorable state of our environment could be the cause of millions of
people coming down with some kind of cancer. The response, in no
uncertain terms, was that I had no medical or scientific expertise
and should keep quiet with my opinion.</TE>
<TE>   When my own husband was diagnosed with liver cancer, I took him
weekly to the UCLA oncology clinic for chemotherapy. I was aghast to
see the number of people being treated there -- tiny children,
teenagers, the middle-aged and the elderly. A plague for all ages.
And yet all we hear is that research is being done to find a "cure"
for cancer. Cancer is big business.</TE>

<HD>Critics Assail Ahmanson Study</HD>
<DH>Foes of huge housing project in Ventura County tell a
committee that the environmental report is inadequate. Decision is
postponed.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the Ahmanson Ranch housing project turned out in force
Monday to assail a follow-up study on the environmental effects of
the proposed 3,050-home mini-city.</LD>
<LD>   Critics called the report inadequate and demanded that further
studies be conducted to determine how water, air, wildlife and
traffic would be affected by the development, which would be built in
Ventura County on the Los Angeles County line.</LD>
<LD>   "This whole document is a whitewash," said Mary Wiesbrock, an
Agoura Hills activist and one of two dozen speakers who assailed the
report during a three-hour public hearing.</LD>
<TE>   The county's Environmental Report Review Committee ultimately
delayed a vote on the report until Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   It then goes to the Planning Commission and finally to the Board
of Supervisors -- although a proposal by Supervisor Judy Mikels could
speed up that process.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels is recommending that the board sit alongside the Planning
Commission when it considers the report next month.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to her colleagues, Mikels said this "will not negate
the need for the Board to hold its own public hearing," but would
save members of the public and other government agencies from having
to return at a later date to restate their opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels' request, which the board is scheduled to discuss today,
prompted Ahmanson foes to question whether Ventura County officials
are trying to push the project through before the end of the year,
when the make-up of the Board of Supervisors changes.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor-elect Linda Parks, a critic of the project, replaces
retiring Supervisor Frank Schillo in January.</TE>
<TE>   Tsilah Burman, executive director for Rally to Save Ahmanson
Ranch, noted that Mikels received a $5,000 contribution from project
developer Washington Mutual in May.</TE>
<TE>   "There appears to be a political agenda here," Burman said. "There
is no other reason why they need to rush this through."</TE>
<TE>   The comments reflect the controversy surrounding a project that
would put homes on the largest remaining piece of undeveloped private
land ringing the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the development
in 1992, but legal challenges stalled it for years. In 1999,
biologists discovered a rare frog and flower species at the
2,800-acre site, prompting supervisors to order a follow-up
environmental study.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that the project would substantially affect the
rare San Fernando Valley spineflower and the California red-legged
frog, but that safeguards could be taken to reduce the loss to
acceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of opponents, consultants also tested for
contamination from the nearby Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field
Laboratory. Planners said they found none. The report also found no
need for further traffic studies.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's hearing, critics called those studies inadequate.
They argued that the project would dump thousands of cars onto local
streets and the Ventura Freeway each day. And several speakers
expressed concern that Rocketdyne pollutants have leached into the
soil and could be stirred up by grading.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope this project is not built over my dead body," said
Calabasas resident Carol Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers also complained about omissions and errors in the
three-volume document, and said that the public should have been
given more time to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of some government agencies were not present
Monday because the hearing was held on Columbus Day, which is a state
and federal holiday. The committee postponed its vote to give those
agencies, which include the state Department of Fish and Game and the
federal Fish and Wildlife Service, time to respond in writing.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday's hearing, actor Larry Hagman, former Ventura County
Supervisor Susan Lacey and other community leaders gathered outside
the meeting room and called for a halt to the Ahmanson Ranch project.</TE>

<HD>Frank Barron, 80; UC Scholar, Author Explored Psychology of
Creative Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank X. Barron, the internationally known UC Berkeley scholar who
began exploring the creative mind in the 1950s, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Barron, also a UC Santa Cruz psychology professor from 1969 to
1992, died Oct. 6 at his Santa Cruz home of complications from a
fall, his family said.</LD>
<LD>   The author of several books about the psychology of creativity,
Barron also delighted in writing poetry. A book of his poems,
"Ghosts," will be published posthumously.</LD>
<TE>   Risk-taking, the veteran researcher said on several occasions, is
a common characteristic of creative people. "Creativity requires
taking what [Albert] Einstein called 'a leap into the unknown,' " he
said in a 1979 discussion of his work. "This can mean putting your
beliefs, reputation and resources on the line as you suffer the
slings and arrows of ridicule."</TE>
<TE>   Barron, a native of Lansford, Pa., earned a bachelor's degree in
philosophy from La Salle College, served as an Army medic in World
War II, and completed a master's in psychology at the University of
Minnesota and a doctorate at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   He began his half-century of pioneering research as a founding
member of Berkeley's Institute of Personality Assessment in 1949.
Although he had teaching stints at Harvard, Bryn Mawr, the University
of Hawaii and Wesleyan, he remained with the institute until moving
permanently to UC Santa Cruz in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s, Barron conducted in-depth interviews with
creative thinkers, including architects, research scientists,
mathematicians and such writers as Norman Mailer, Truman Capote and
Jessamyn West. He also helped design personality measurement tests.</TE>
<TE>   Barron detailed many of his findings in what is still considered a
major work on creativity, the 1963 "Creativity and Psychological
Health," which former Times book editor Robert Kirsch praised as "a
work which is both readable and illuminating, informative and
challenging."</TE>
<TE>   A creative person, Barron observed in that book, pays attention to
vague insights that most people cast aside on grounds of good sense
and has "ego strength" that helps him rally from difficulties. He
also is strongly motivated to find new ways to bring order to the
world, and is willing to rebel against conformity to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "The creative genius," Barron wrote, "may be at once naive and
knowledgeable, being at home equally to primitive symbolism and to
rigorous logic. He is both more primitive and more cultured, more
destructive and more constructive, occasionally crazier and yet

<LD>Luis Nogales, a businessman and philanthropist, pledged $1 million
Monday to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</LD>
<LD>   The gift will help further the fund's work on behalf of immigrants
in education, health care and jobs, Nogales said.</LD>
<LD>   "Millions of Latino immigrants are making valuable contributions
to our economy and society, but they live and work unprotected by our
laws and are marginalized in participating in the life of our
nation," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Nogales is head of Nogales Investors, a Los Angeles-based equity
investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   He formerly was president of Univision and United Press
International.</TE>
<TE>   The grandson of Mexican immigrants, Nogales is also a senior
advisor to Deutsche Bank Private Equity Group and served on the
Stanford Board of Trustees for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still reeling from this announcement," said the fund's
president, Antonia Hernandez. "We deeply appreciate his generous
donation and so does our large immigrant community."</TE>

<HD>It's an All-California Series, but Fans Are Worlds Apart</HD>
<DH>Rivalry between Angel and Giant lovers heats up faster than
you can say rally monkey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoffrey Mohan and Stan Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants facing off against the Anaheim Angels in the
World Series, made possible by a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals on Monday night, will be about so much more than sports.</LD>
<LD>   For the fourth time in history, an all-California series will
offer the opportunity to dissect the Golden State and line up its
parts along lines both mythical and real.</LD>
<LD>   It will pit fog versus smog, cioppino versus chile verde,
politically correct versus politically conservative, Web-surfing
versus wave surfing, and the Grateful Dead versus Los Lobos.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the country will have to get on the bandwagon or sit
it out, as one fan put it.</TE>
<TE>   "California World Series: Deal with it," read a sign in Pacific
Bell Park as the Giants celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   But the real quandary, the tug-of-war with deep moral
implications, is saved for the dispirited Dodger fan. To wit: Does
hatred win over indifference? Is it OK to drop a haughty disdain for
the Halos of Orange County, just to feed a hatred for all things
Giant?</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, can Dodger-haters up north project their rivalry on a
Dodger substitute?</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim's never been on the radar, but it'll be just as easy to
hate them," Ricardo Perez, 31, a businessman and lifelong Giants fan,
said in the Royal Exchange bar in San Francisco's financial district.</TE>
<TE>   "They represent the same problem," added Nicholas Meyer, 30, a San
Francisco native who recently moved back to the Bay Area from Los
Angeles after living here three years.</TE>
<TE>   At Lefty O'Doul's, a Giants mecca in San Francisco's Union Square,
three Mason conventioneers from the San Fernando Valley watched the
game with bemused detachment. But they admitted they relish the
prospect of an all-California series.</TE>
<TE>   The last one -- San Francisco vs. Oakland in 1989 -- didn't count,
insisted Ken Chew, 63, a wedding photographer from Winnetka. "That's
not all-California," he said. "That's just the Bay Area."</TE>
<TE>   If there weren't enough nuances for rivalry and revenge, many
Angels fans rooted for the St. Louis Cardinals, but not because they
seemed like an easier mark. It was solely for the prospect of
bringing back to Anaheim two former Angels now playing for the
Cardinals, then beating the stuffing out of them: Jim Edmonds, who
was traded to St. Louis in 2000 for Adam Kennedy, and Chuck Finley,
the Angels' winningest pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to see Chuck come in," said Scott Brown of
Fullerton, who fantasized about being "the loudest heckler he's gonna
have."</TE>
<TE>   It was not to be. Instead, the Angels will get the taciturn Barry
Bonds, who was raised in Riverside, and fellow Riverside native Dusty
Baker, the Giants manager. They'll get J.T. Snow, son of Rams great
Jack Snow, who went to Los Alamitos High School.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Snow started in the Angel organization and will face
Tim Salmon and Troy Percival, two of the guys with whom he came up
through the minors. And while he hasn't said as much, Angels Manager
Mike Scioscia, an ex-Dodgers catcher, may relish matching wits with
former teammate Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever they play, I don't care -- my dreams have come true,"
said Heather Pone, 28, of Orange, who would have preferred the
Finley/Edmonds revenge scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who will make his first World Series appearance in his
storied 17-year career, said the rare matchup -- which pairs two
wild-card teams for the first time -- is deserved by both teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels are a good team," Bonds told ESPN. "They've played
well, that's why they're in the World Series. We've played well,
that's why we're in the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Irvin, 28, of Fountain Valley, had a rare, unemotional reason
for wanting San Francisco: "I think their lineup isn't as deep or as
strong as the Cardinals'," Irvin said. "I don't think the pitching
staff is as good as the Cardinals'. All you have to do is walk Barry
Bonds and you get through that lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever. That's not what it means to attorney Brian Coolidge of
San Francisco. "Four words: bastion of conservative Republicanism,"
the 28-year-old said of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Palmer, 24, a British transplant and Web developer, stabbed
at the heart of the Disney-owned team: "What's next, the rally monkey
on ice?" he said. "We're going to drown the bastard in blood."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Soto, a bell captain at the Fairmont Hotel, quietly
contemplated the dramatic potential at Lefty O'Doul's. "It will be a
good series . . . . Then, everybody's expecting an earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, during the last all-California matchup, a 7.0-magnitude
tremor rippled through Candlestick Park during Game 3 of the
Giants-Athletics series on Oct. 17, 1989. The Loma Prieta quake
killed 67 people, and forced a 10-day postponement of the game, won
by the A's en route to a four-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Twice before, the Dodgers and A's squared off in a World Series,
with the Dodgers winning in five games in 1988 -- a series best known
for Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit home run in the ninth inning that won the
first game. The A's won the other matchup, in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the opponent was decided Monday night, fans lined up
at Edison Field, oblivious to signs posted there that the series was
sold out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just hoping that same miracle atmosphere that's happening on
the field is going to happen out here so we can get some tickets,"
said Johnny Ramirez, 36, of Rancho Cucamonga, one of hundreds of fans
who swarmed the stadium.</TE>

<HD>Clerk-Recorder Race Nonpartisan in Name Only</HD>
<DH>Peotter emphasizes GOP affiliation in battle against
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The runoff next month to fill the supposedly nonpartisan position of
county clerk-recorder may end up turning not on the qualifications of
the candidates but their party affiliations.</LD>
<LD>   The race pits longtime Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly against Bruce
Peotter, a Newport Beach attorney and recording document executive.
Both are seeking to run an office that handles county documents
ranging from birth certificates to marriage licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Peotter, 43, said he's the better choice because he's a Republican
and Daly is a Democrat.</LD>
<TE>   "From a ballot standpoint, it's nonpartisan," Peotter said. "But
from a voting standpoint, people are looking for what you believe in,
and Republicans want small government."</TE>
<TE>   Daly, 48, said his campaign has focused on gaining the support of
prominent Republicans, Democrats and Independents. Daly said voters
should look not at his party label but at the 17 years he has spent
as an Anaheim school board member, city councilman and mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a nonpartisan office, and I fully embrace that fact,"
Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   In the March primary, Daly won 41% of the vote, or 153,917;
Peotter took 24%, or 89,945.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates are seeking the office left vacant by the death of
Gary L. Granville in February. Granville had endorsed Daly, who said
he would continue some of the innovations Granville brought to the
office.</TE>
<TE>   Granville had introduced such technology as online ordering of
vital records, including birth, death and marriage documents.</TE>
<TE>   After his death, county supervisors appointed Darlene Bloom acting
clerk-recorder. She also is clerk of the Board of Supervisors, a
nonelective office.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Daly said he would like to explore setting up
satellite offices at city halls. Residents could use the offices to
get county documents, saving trips to Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Peotter said he would explore using online services to boost
efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Merging the clerk-recorder's office with the registrar of voters
might also save money and should be explored, Peotter said.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates have amassed tens of thousands of dollars in
campaign donations, with Daly ahead of Peotter by a 4-1 ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Daly has raised $163,000 to Peotter's $41,000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Conniff, the bandleader, composer and arranger whose orchestra
and chorus produced a string of Top 40 popular music albums such as "
'S Wonderful" and the Grammy-winning "Somewhere My Love," has died.
He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Conniff, who had a stroke in March, died Saturday at Palomar
Medical Center in Escondido.</LD>
<LD>   In a career of nearly 70 years that began as a swing-era
trombonist in the 1930s and included stints as a player and arranger
with the Bunny Berigan, Bob Crosby and Artie Shaw bands, Conniff
recorded more than 100 albums that have sold more than 70 million
copies.</LD>
<TE>   He scored 28 Top 40 albums from 1957 to 1968, including "Say It
With Music (A Touch of Latin)," "Memories Are Made of This" and the
1966 million-seller "Somewhere My Love."</TE>
<TE>   The title tune of the "Somewhere My Love" album -- "Lara's Theme"
by Maurice Jarre from the film "Dr. Zhivago," with lyrics by Paul
Francis Webster -- also made the top 10 singles charts and earned
Conniff a Grammy for best performance by a chorus.</TE>
<TE>   In his last public appearance in March, Conniff conducted a choir
singing "Somewhere My Love" at the wedding of Liza Minnelli and David
Gest.</TE>
<TE>   Conniff had more than 10 gold albums and two platinum albums (for
"Somewhere My Love" and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas"); he also won
CBS Records' award for Best Selling Artist for 1962 and numerous
international awards.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Columbia Records in 1954 as an arranger, Conniff arranged
a string of hits produced by legendary artists and repertoire
director Mitch Miller, including Don Cherry's "Band of Gold," Johnnie
Ray's "Just Walking in the Rain," Guy Mitchell's "Singing the Blues,"
Frankie Laine's "Moonlight Gambler," Marty Robbins' "A White Sport
Coat" and Johnny Mathis' "Chances Are," "Wonderful, Wonderful" and
"It's Not for Me To Say."</TE>
<TE>   It was during this period that Conniff launched the "new sound"
that became his signature, using male and female singers' voices as
though they were instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few arrangers had trademarks, but if you heard a Conniff
arrangement, you knew it was Ray," Miller said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said Conniff had done an arrangement for Harry James' hit
version of George and Ira Gershwin's " 'S Wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Take that same arrangement and add women's voices to the
brass as other instruments to give another color and men's voices to
the woodwinds,' " said Miller. "We tried it out on a single record,
and it got lots of play."</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing album " 'S Wonderful" spent nine months in the Top 20,
ultimately sold about 15 million copies and was followed by " 'S
Marvelous" and " 'S Awful Nice."</TE>
<TE>   "The integration of the orchestral and the choral was something
that hadn't been explored much in popular music, and for the time, I
think he was considered by many a pop music master," said Timothy
Edwards, head of operations at UCLA's musical special collections.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Cash Box magazine named Conniff "the most promising
up-and-coming band leader" in both 1957 and 1958. And in 1959, disc
jockeys voted the Ray Conniff Orchestra and Singers "the most played
orchestra on the air."</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, on "It's the Talk of the Town," Conniff began altering
his formula by having his chorus sing words.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Buddy Ebsen, a close friend of Conniff, remembers him as a
gentle man. "I have been a fan of Ray Conniff and his talent since
long before I met him," Ebsen said Monday. "I worship the quality of
all his music and his integrity as a person."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1916, in Attleboro, Mass., Conniff grew up in a musical
family. His mother played piano and his trombone-playing father led a
local band. In high school, Conniff started a dance orchestra. After
graduating, he landed his first professional job, playing with a band
in Boston called Dan Murphy's Musical Skippers.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Berigan's band in 1937 as a trombonist and arranger, and
was hired away by Crosby in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   After playing with Bob Crosby's Bobcats for a year, Conniff spent
four years with Artie Shaw and was featured on several Shaw hits.</TE>
<TE>   After a stint with the Glen Gray band, Conniff spent two years in
the Army, arranging for the Armed Forces Radio Services in Hollywood.
After the war, he joined the Harry James band as an arranger and
freelanced as an arranger before joining Columbia Records.</TE>
<TE>   After his Grammy win for "Somewhere My Love," Conniff earned two
other Grammy nominations -- in 1968 for "Honey" and in 1969 for
Conniff's version of the Rod McKuen song "Jean."</TE>
<TE>   In the late '60s, wanting to create the same sound listeners heard
on recordings, Conniff toured the United States and Europe doing the
world's first live concerts in three-channel stereo. In 1974, he
became the first American popular musician to record in Russia, where
he used a local chorus to make "Ray Conniff In Moscow."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Tamara, went on to become music editor of the
Hollywood Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Until his stroke, he continued recording about one album a year
and toured annually in Brazil with his full orchestra and chorus.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Vera; his daughter; a son, Jimmy;
three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A private funeral service for family and friends will be held at 2
p.m. Thursday at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and
Mortuary, 1218 Glendon Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Audit Urges Major Reforms of Visitors Bureau Spending</HD>
<DH>'Extravagant' salaries, perks are cited in draft report
that also says city contract with nonprofit agency lacks measurable
performance standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau's spending on
executive salaries, bonuses, luxury travel and meals appears
"extravagant," and the city should impose tighter controls to make
sure its portion of the budget is spent appropriately, according to a
draft audit conducted for the city controller's office.</LD>
<LD>   The audit also says the city contract with the visitors bureau
lacks measurable performance standards. As a result, the nonprofit
agency has continued to receive city funding despite a steep drop in
convention bookings.</LD>
<LD>   "As an autonomous entity with control of millions of taxpayer
dollars, the LACVB is not subject to traditional municipal
expenditure controls, oversight and disclosure requirements," the
36-page document concluded as it called for major reforms.</LD>
<TE>   The audit was conducted by Sjoberg Evashenk Consulting, and a copy
of the draft was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick said the final audit will be released
late this week or early next week. She declined to comment on the
report, and an aide said the draft is subject to change before it is
finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen the final draft yet, and it would be
inappropriate to comment on the audit before the controller completes
it and releases it publicly," said Michael Collins, the bureau's
executive vice president</TE>
<TE>   The draft audit recommended more than a dozen reforms, including
negotiation of a new contract with measurable performance standards.
It also said the city should consider appointment of a city official
as an ex-officio member of the visitors bureau board to increase
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau board member Lesa Slaughter said she has not seen the draft
audit, but said any findings about excessive salaries and spending
should be seriously considered.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of systemic issues that we have to look at,
salaries being just one of them," Slaughter said.</TE>
<TE>   The city gave the bureau $16 million in hotel bed taxes in
2001--about 65% of the bureau's budget--to bring conventions and
tourists to Los Angeles, the auditors said.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau also receives funds from the private sector. Auditors
said the city has an interest in how the private funds are spent
because they should help maximize the city's effectiveness in
bringing conventions and tourists to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The auditors concluded that city funds are used disproportionately
to cover administrative overhead, and that there is not enough city
control of the entertainment and travel expenses paid for by private
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau expenditures of private funds that auditors said "appear
extravagant" include:</TE>
<TE>   * Bureau President George Kirkland's $350,000 salary and incentive
package for the year examined is "significantly higher" than the
$240,000 average paid to chief executives at major convention bureaus
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   * A bureau staff retreat held in the fiscal year 2000-01 that cost
nearly $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Paid memberships for executives in multiple civic organizations.</TE>
<TE>   * Administrative expense reimbursement for "luxury travel and
meals."</TE>
<TE>   The expenditures may be allowable under rules governing private
nonprofits, the auditors concluded. But they said the spending "may
not be viewed by the city's leaders as the highest and best use of
limited funds to achieve the greatest results on behalf of Los
Angeles and its residents."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors also questioned the bureau's spending of $250,000 on a
dinner at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a convention of
professional meeting planners. The expenses may be appropriate, the
auditors said, but the city and the bureau should determine whether
incentives exceed the amount of taxes generated by events.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members said Monday that the report will be reviewed
as the panel begins talks with the bureau to extend its contract,
which will expire June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a need for accountability, but I believe for good reason
the convention bureau has done a huge amount of good work for L.A.,"
said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland, who once received a $199,000 bonus, did not return calls
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The audit found bureau compensation for its executives and senior
managers is "significantly higher" than the levels of other
convention bureaus, and recommended a new salary and incentives
study.</TE>
<TE>   The audit noted that 48 conventions have canceled in the last
three years, and said some business is lost despite offering huge
discounts on convention hall rentals.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors recommended that groups be required to repay the discount
if they do not draw enough conventioneers to generate sufficient
hotel bed taxes to cover the break on rent.</TE>
<TE>   It also called for improvement of the bureau's Web site, saying it
only gets 59,000 visits annually, compared with 400,000 at the Las
Vegas convention bureau's Web site and 140,000 in Atlanta.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed, 1 Hurt in Head-On Collision Near Fillmore</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men were killed and a woman injured Sunday in a head-on collision
on California 126 near Fillmore.</LD>
<LD>   The California Highway Patrol said an Oldsmobile driven by Hector
Ramos, 21, of Santa Paula was westbound in the wrong lane about 7:15
p.m. when it hit a Volkswagen van head-on two miles west of Fillmore.
Both cars were traveling about 60 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Ramos and his passenger, 18-year-old Eduardo Ramos, died
instantly. The two men were related, said CHP spokesman Steve Reid,
but he didn't know how.</LD>
<TE>   The van's driver, Lea Fowler, 30, of Valencia was taken to Henry
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, where she was listed
in fair condition Monday. Fillmore firefighters spent 45 minutes
cutting Fowler from the wreckage while the highway was closed to one
lane until about 9:30 p.m., authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Toxicology tests are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren said the Oldsmobile struck the van
squarely.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was five or six feet shorter than normal, like they ran
straight into a wall," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ojai Trust Seeks to Preserve Ranch</HD>
<DH>Land conservancy plans to raise $4 million to buy more than
1,400 acres along the Ventura River. Sale would likely kill prospects
for a proposed golf course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Ojai land-preservation group announced plans Monday to acquire a 2
1/2-square-mile swath of oak-studded meadows and chaparral-covered
hills--a century-old ranch that is the largest private landholding in
the Ojai Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The Ojai Valley Land Conservancy plans to raise $4 million to
purchase the land from the Intell Management and Investment Co., a
New York firm that has owned it for two years.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as we know, it would be the largest purchase of open space
in Ventura County by a land trust," said Jim Engel, the conservancy's
executive director.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett, whose district includes
Ojai, said the pending purchase "really launches us on the road to
protecting the entire Ventura River watershed."</TE>
<TE>   Straddling three miles of the Ventura River just north of
California 150, the land is home to roadrunners and quail, bobcats
and black bears. Eventually, its new owners hope, some 12 miles of
hiking and equestrian trails will meander through the sprawling old
ranch that original owner W.I. Rice called El Nido (the nest).</TE>
<TE>   Engel said the purchase would effectively end the prospect of a
golf course on the property. That possibility has been bitterly
fought by environmental activists since 1987, when Japanese media
tycoon Kagehisa Toyama unveiled plans for the elite private Farmont
golf course on 200 of the ranch's 2,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a golf course were revived earlier this year by Intell,
which invests in properties as diverse as an entertainment complex in
New York City's Times Square and Enron's former headquarters in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   However, those plans were suspended after county officials
demanded additional environmental studies, said Lindsay Nielson, a
Ventura attorney who represents Intell.</TE>
<TE>   "Having spent close to $600,000 on a prior environmental impact
report, there was little appetite for spending an additional $100,000
on water studies," Nielson said, adding that the golf course idea is
"not completely dead, but on life support."</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement with Intell, the conservancy would own 1,416
acres and hold a conservation easement barring development on an
additional 150 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Intell would retain two home sites on the property and is in
negotiations to sell the remaining 400 acres, which includes the
original golf course site, Nielson said. The prospective buyer's
identity and plans for the land have not been disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   The area to be preserved spans rolling terrain between the Ventura
River and Los Padres National Forest. It includes a 48-acre orange
grove and grazing land for about 100 head of cattle. Whether those
uses will continue has yet to be decided, Engel said.</TE>
<TE>   A one-lane asphalt road runs a mile and a half through the
property for crews servicing a canal between the river and Lake
Casitas. Aside from that and an incongruous line of telephone poles,
the land looks rough-and-ready, with game trails lacing through the
sage and yucca.</TE>
<TE>   "From an ecological standpoint, it's really what the rest of the
valley was 100 years ago," Engel said.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the purchase will likely come from the state's Coastal
Conservancy and private donations.</TE>

<TE>   "From an ecological standpoint, it's really what the rest of the

<TE>   Five springs run year-round on the property. Around one, the ferns
are lush and green, even in this time of drought. Animals including
deer and mountain lions make their way between the river and the
forest through a number of wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put it all together, with its adjacency to Los Padres,
we'll have river bottom to ridgeline potentially protected," Engel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the purchase will likely come from the state's Coastal
Conservancy and private donations.</TE>
<TE>   The agency already has put $1.5 million into two projects just
upstream from the property: the Matilija Dam dismantling project and
a fish ladder at the Robles Diversion into Lake Casitas.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Brand, a Coastal Conservancy spokesman, said the Ventura
River wending through the property is "a key migration corridor" for
the southern steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to provide a major portion of the amount needed to
complete this project," Brand said, adding that the local conservancy
must show that it can raise the money needed for the property's
long-term maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand they'll be seeking donations to make that
possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase agreement calls for the Ojai conservancy to acquire
funding by next June.</TE>
<TE>   That's a sad necessity, said attorney Neilson, who represented
Toyama before Intell became his client.</TE>
<TE>   In return for building his golf course, the Japanese radio magnate
had offered to donate to the conservancy a conservation easement for
the 1,500 acres it now wants to purchase, Neilson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the golf course gone through, there would have been a lot of
benefits to the community," he said. "Now they'll have to pay dearly
for it."</TE>

<HD>Growers Escape Big Loss From Port Strike</HD>
<DH>Ventura County agriculture officials estimate the recent
shipping lockout cost over $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Local growers apparently avoided severe financial losses during the
recent shutdown of the Port of Hueneme, although damage exceeded $2
million, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We came through it with very few problems," county Agricultural
Commissioner Earl McPhail said. "My understanding is that there
wasn't much damage locally. I haven't heard anything different from
the packinghouses."</LD>
<LD>   As the 10-day shipping lockout began, cartons of late-season
Valencia oranges were in a refrigerated warehouse at the port ready
for export to Asia.</LD>
<TE>   When port operations resumed Wednesday, McPhail said, the citrus
was still fresh enough for shipment to overseas customers, although
it may have to be sold at discount.</TE>
<TE>   But Gerry Davidson, a spokesman for the Sunkist growers
cooperative, said that about 142,000 cartons of citrus that were
scheduled for export during the lockout had to be repackaged and sold
domestically or turned into juice, which provides little profit to
growers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, at least 20,000 cartons were ruined. Davidson
estimated the total losses at about $2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Taylor, vice president of Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co.,
Ventura County's largest farming enterprise, said oranges and lemons
grown near Yuma and Phoenix, Ariz., and in California's Coachella
Valley, are being shipped through the Hueneme port these days.</TE>
<TE>   Until a final contract is reached between the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents dockworkers, and the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines, Taylor said
a replay of port disruptions is possible.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush invoked federal law to order West Coast ports
reopened last week and directed dockworkers and maritime companies to
continue negotiating during an 80-day cooling-off period.</TE>
<TE>   "What I worry about is the postponement of the negotiations,"
Taylor said. "This will crop back up around December and January,
which is the peak of our navel orange season, when we export a
considerable amount."</TE>
<TE>   Officials had worried that a shipment of Ecuadorean bananas stuck
on a Del Monte ship during the lockout would be spoiled. But Will
Berg, spokesman for the Oxnard Harbor District port, said the bananas
survived because they had been stored at 57 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of it was acceptable for market use," Berg said. "They were
still green when they opened up the hold."</TE>
<TE>   Berg said the port was still getting back to normal Monday. It had
two banana ships and a vehicle carrier at its docks for unloading.</TE>

<HD>Davis Avoids Spotlight as Election Day Nears</HD>
<DH>Aides say the governor is preparing for the race's final
three weeks. Simon calls him panicked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Three weeks before election day, Republican gubernatorial candidate
Bill Simon Jr. is scouring the state for votes and Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis is ... where?</LD>
<LD>   Davis has kept his profile low throughout his campaign for another
four-year term, but he has been especially scarce in the week since
his Oct. 7 debate with Simon.</LD>
<LD>   One of the last Davis sightings occurred Saturday -- not at a
campaign rally, but at an Anaheim Angels playoff game in Orange
County. The governor -- a guest of Disney chairman Michael Eisner,
said campaign spokesman Roger Salazar -- was seen stiffly clutching a
pair of noisemaking "thunder sticks" at one point.</LD>
<TE>   Davis isn't hiding from prying reporters or trying to sit on his
lead, aides insisted -- merely catching his breath after a busy
summer and September's bill signings. He spent Monday in Los Angeles,
finalizing preparations for a three-week campaign blitz, talking with
strategists and supporters, and discussing campaign ads, aides say.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just gearing up and getting ready for the last three weeks,"
Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing in most polls, Simon on Monday taunted his opponent as
running scared.</TE>
<TE>   "We are surging, and Davis is panicked," Simon said, speaking on
the Mark and Marino radio show on KRLA-AM (870) in Los Angeles. "I
mean, that's why he comes out with the crazy comments that he does.
That's why he won't debate me anymore. That's why his people won't
allow him in public with the press. Where is Gray Davis? He is the
virtual governor. We don't know where he is."</TE>
<TE>   Simon sounded understandably eager to share the spotlight with
Davis, especially after enduring another disastrous week. Simon was
hammered after claiming that he had evidence that Davis had accepted
an illegal campaign contribution as lieutenant governor -- only to
later concede that the purported photographic evidence didn't live up
to its billing.</TE>
<TE>   Given Simon's latest self-inflicted wound, and the resulting media
frenzy, Davis was wise to avoid the limelight last week, campaign
consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   "Granted, most of it was due to his opponent, but [Davis] couldn't
have had a much better week," said Democratic consultant Richie Ross.
"I wouldn't do one thing to take Simon's name out of the headlines."</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides said the governor has no intention of trying to lie
low in the campaign's final three weeks. But exactly how -- and how
much -- Davis intends to make his case directly to voters remains to
be seen.</TE>
<TE>   In a reasonably close race where voter enthusiasm is low, Davis
must fire up his political base to ensure it votes on Nov. 5,
Democratic and Republican consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis plans to begin doing just that this week, aides said.</TE>
<TE>   He will devote much of the week to shoring up his support among
Latinos, a crucial bloc of voters for Davis -- and a source of
simmering discontent as well. The Latino legislative caucus, angered
at the governor's decision to veto legislation that would have given
driver's licenses to some illegal immigrants, has decided not to
endorse Davis for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Davis campaign unveiled a 60-second,
Spanish-language radio spot touting the governor's support for
Latinos in policy decisions and appointments. The spot ends with the
words, "Gov. Gray Davis -- he's the best friend of the Latino
community."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you get one or two stories that overshadow all the good
things the governor has done the last four years," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   "As the governor always says, his detractors will tell you all the
bad news so it's up to him to talk about the good things," he said.
"He's got a very strong record of things he's proud of relating to
Latinos."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also plans to attend a Latino legislative caucus dinner
tonight in Los Angeles in honor of state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles), Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' stretch-run campaigning will begin in earnest this weekend,
when the governor is scheduled to crisscross the state, attending
rallies and meeting with farm workers and other supporters.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the campaign, Davis is aiming to "give the
picture of being upbeat and in command," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   "So I think him promoting his record big-time is what he ought to
be doing," he said. "I think people have concluded that Simon is no
alternative, and so they are eager to hear what [Davis] has to say."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Johnson, a Republican political consultant, said the Davis
strategy throughout the campaign has been to "make sure the election
is not about Gray Davis," because of the governor's high negatives
among voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It really does come down to turnout, and that is a dicey game for
Gray Davis," Johnson said. "If he can't turn out his base, he's in
real trouble."</TE>
<TE>   As Davis goes about shoring up his base in these final weeks, his
primary aim will be to avoid making a mistake that could give Simon's
struggling campaign a boost -- the sort of cautious approach that has
always defined Davis as a politician, consultants said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the most measured, disciplined, risk-averse sprint in
the history of politics or track-and-field," said Dan Schnur, a
Republican political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "If no news happens between now and Nov. 5, that would suit
[Davis] just fine," he said.</TE>

<HD>Stained Judicial Race Has Ugly New Turn</HD>
<DH>First the incumbent, charged with molestation and child
porn, quit the Orange County contest. Now two rivals fight over one's
personal history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters would have expected the race for Judicial Office No. 21 to
calm down after incumbent Ronald Kline, facing molestation and child
pornography charges, took his name off the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Orange County Superior Court race has grown
increasingly ugly in a new way, with a private investigator digging
into one candidate's background and divorce records.</LD>
<LD>   The opposing candidate, former prosecutor Gay G. Sandoval, has
made an issue of her opponent's past financial problems and divorce
case. Her rival, Dana Point attorney John Adams, accused Sandoval of
crawling into the gutter in a desperate attempt to win the election.</LD>
<TE>   Sandoval and Adams ran against Kline as write-in candidates in the
March primary. Adams campaigned aggressively in southern Orange
County and got his name on several slate mailers, actually outpolling
Kline.</TE>
<TE>   Adams won 33.2% of the vote, Kline won 32%, and Sandoval won
10.8%. Kline quit the race weeks later, saying he needed to focus on
his upcoming trial for allegedly molesting a teenager and downloading
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Bar Assn. ranked Sandoval "qualified." The group
did not rank Adams because he didn't respond to its questions. Adams
said he didn't think the association's analysis would offer a full
appraisal of his career as a civil attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The mudslinging began last week when a former business associate
of Adams hired a private detective to unearth documents describing
Adams' past political and financial woes and details of a bitter
divorce. He then provided the findings to Sandoval and the press.
Sandoval then sent letters to those who have endorsed Adams, pointing
to his divorce file and several civil suits he was involved in.
Sandoval urged those supporters to study the documents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really low blow," Adams said. "We're talking about
issues that are over 10 or 12 years old. It's very unseemly for my
opponent to suggest people go through my divorce file."</TE>
<TE>   The documents include details about a $218,000 loan Adams received
from Patrick and Jeannette McDaniel in 1991. Adams, who used his
parents' Fountain Valley home as collateral, failed to repay the debt
on time, and his parents lost their home to foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who wrote to the McDaniels that he was "financially
desperate" and "completely out of personal assets," made a $55,000
cash down payment on a $275,000 home for himself three months after
the foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the disclosure, Adams said he had sought the loan
during a difficult financial period during the recession.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate I was unable to make payment on their loan,"
Adams said. "The McDaniels were unwilling to accommodate changes in
the loan. The collateral was able to fully satisfy the lender."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said, too, that there was nothing improper about his buying
a new home once his parents' home had been taken to settle the debt.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval said the details of Adams' loan were legitimate campaign
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone should know about this," Sandoval said. "I would
compare this race to a medical patient choosing between a doctor with
a lot of surgical experience and one without hospital privileges."</TE>
<TE>   Adams called Sandoval's letters to his supporters "despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Adams has also been criticized for listing his association with an
environmental group on campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activist Roger Von Butow once appointed Adams as a
director of his nonprofit group, the South Orange County Watershed
Conservancy. Adams listed the conservancy on his resume and posted it
on his campaign Web site but removed it after Von Butow demanded his
resignation. Adams, Von Butow said, had shirked his duties by failing
to organize fund-raisers or convene meetings for eight months. Adams
used the post only to "pad" his resume, Von Butow said.</TE>
<TE>   Adams called that assertion false. "It was a volunteer
organization, and I contributed substantially to it. I take offense
that someone would say I used volunteer work to pad my resume."</TE>
<TE>   Adams, 50, cites his experience in the private sector, including
that as head of an automotive specialty retailer. A graduate of
Stanford Law School, he also was an activist in the fight against an
airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval, 50, went to Loyola Law School and was an Orange County
deputy district attorney, handling child abuse cases. She also served
on several municipal boards in her hometown of Costa Mesa.</TE>

his upcoming trial for allegedly molesting a teenager and downloading
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Bar Assn. ranked Sandoval "qualified." The group
did not rank Adams because he didn't respond to its questions. Adams
said he didn't think the association's analysis would offer a full
appraisal of his career as a civil attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The mudslinging began last week when a former business associate
of Adams hired a private detective to unearth documents describing
Adams' past political and financial woes and details of a bitter
divorce. He then provided the findings to Sandoval and the press.
Sandoval then sent letters to those who have endorsed Adams, pointing
to his divorce file and several civil suits he was involved in.
Sandoval urged those supporters to study the documents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really low blow," Adams said. "We're talking about
issues that are over 10 or 12 years old. It's very unseemly for my
opponent to suggest people go through my divorce file."</TE>
<TE>   The documents include details about a $218,000 loan Adams received
from Patrick and Jeannette McDaniel in 1991. Adams, who used his
parents' Fountain Valley home as collateral, failed to repay the debt
on time, and his parents lost their home to foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who wrote to the McDaniels that he was "financially
desperate" and "completely out of personal assets," made a $55,000
cash down payment on a $275,000 home for himself three months after
the foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the disclosure, Adams said he had sought the loan
during a difficult financial period during the recession.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate I was unable to make payment on their loan,"
Adams said. "The McDaniels were unwilling to accommodate changes in
the loan. The collateral was able to fully satisfy the lender."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said, too, that there was nothing improper about his buying
a new home once his parents' home had been taken to settle the debt.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval said the details of Adams' loan were legitimate campaign
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone should know about this," Sandoval said. "I would
compare this race to a medical patient choosing between a doctor with
a lot of surgical experience and one without hospital privileges."</TE>
<TE>   Adams called Sandoval's letters to his supporters "despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Adams has also been criticized for listing his association with an
environmental group on campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activist Roger Von Butow once appointed Adams as a
director of his nonprofit group, the South Orange County Watershed
Conservancy. Adams listed the conservancy on his resume and posted it
on his campaign Web site but removed it after Von Butow demanded his
resignation. Adams, Von Butow said, had shirked his duties by failing
to organize fund-raisers or convene meetings for eight months. Adams
used the post only to "pad" his resume, Von Butow said.</TE>
<TE>   Adams called that assertion false. "It was a volunteer
organization, and I contributed substantially to it. I take offense
that someone would say I used volunteer work to pad my resume."</TE>
<TE>   Adams, 50, cites his experience in the private sector, including
that as head of an automotive specialty retailer. A graduate of
Stanford Law School, he also was an activist in the fight against an
airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval, 50, went to Loyola Law School and was an Orange County
deputy district attorney, handling child abuse cases. She also served
on several municipal boards in her hometown of Costa Mesa.</TE>

<HD>Al Lohman, 69; Partner in Duo That Brightened L.A.'s
Morning Drive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Lohman, the broadcaster who teamed up with Roger Barkley in 1963
and, as Lohman and Barkley, reigned for nearly two decades as
Southern California's top radio comedy duo, has died. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Lohman, whose silly, impromptu humor and even sillier cast of
character voices lightened the morning commute for thousands of
Southern Californians, died Sunday in Rancho Mirage of complications
from bladder cancer.</LD>
<LD>   First teamed at KLAC-AM (570) and then at KFWB-AM (980) before
settling in at KFI-AM (640) in 1968, Lohman and Barkley spent years
at the top or near the top of the morning drive-time ratings.</LD>
<TE>   "For over a quarter-century, Al Lohman carved out a special place
in L.A. radio history," said Don Barrett, author of "Los Angeles
Radio People" and executive editor of LARadio.com.</TE>
<TE>   "He was funny, enormously popular, and yet so unassuming," Barrett
said. "His teaming with the late Roger Barkley made mornings
tolerable and fun for so many of us for so many years."</TE>
<TE>   "He was always very funny, a great entertainer, and just one of
the nicest guys," said broadcaster Gary Owens, who met Lohman in 1957
when they were both working in radio in Omaha and later introduced
Lohman to Barkley on the sidewalk in front of Wallach's Music City in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the comedy of Bob and Ray, Lohman and Barkley served
up a mix of music, news, commercials, banter and unwritten and
unrehearsed comedy bits.</TE>
<TE>   The dry-witted Barkley played straight man to the off-the-wall
Lohman, who created a large stable of zany characters who made up the
Lohman and Barkley "staff." One was human interest man Ted J.
Balogna, who commuted daily from Brawley in his used firetruck with
his wife, W. Eva Schneider Balogna, the poetry editor, hanging on the
back; another was farm reporter Maynard Farmer, who was prone to
being kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   There also were the gluttonous food critic Leonard Leonard (author
of "Eat, or You Will Die"), whose muffled and wheezing delivery
sounded like Mike Roy, who at the time was the jovial gourmet chef at
KNX-AM (1070); reporter Cecil Hudspith, who tooled around in his
Hudspithmobile, which doubled as a lending library; and Judge Roy
Bean, staff musicologist and classical actor, who was from Texas,
where he led a polka band, the Beans on the Plate Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman also tapped the show's sponsors, most famously Longo
Toyota, for comedy bits.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman and Barkley regularly entertained listeners with a wacky
version of a soap opera, complete with a dramatic theme played on the
organ: "Light of My Life: The True-to-Life Story of Men and Women
Living Their Span of Years in a Typical, Small Midwestern Community,
Pine City."</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call what we do satire," Lohman said in 1975, when the
team was at the height of its popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sort of funny nihilism. It's the idea that we shouldn't
get too uptight about things because it's all pretty funny.... Our
basic outlook, I think is that somehow the world will bumble by."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, Lohman said he inherited a sense of
humor from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "As a kid, I was always doing something silly," he told The Times
in 1980. "Later I wanted to do it for a living, but in Iowa at that
time there were no nightclubs so you couldn't go on the stage. Radio
was the natural outlet."</TE>
<TE>   He worked at a radio station in Storm Lake, Iowa, while he was in
college.</TE>
<TE>   After two years in the Army, during which he worked on Armed
Forces Radio while stationed in Panama, Lohman landed a job as a disc
jockey at a radio station in Omaha around 1957.</TE>
<TE>   He later worked at stations in Denver, Dallas and at WABC-AM (770)
New York before heading to Los Angeles in 1962. Barkley, the new
program director at KLAC, hired Lohman to be the station's morning
DJ.</TE>
<TE>   Fate intervened in 1963 when Metromedia purchased KLAC and fired
Barkley and the low-rated Lohman.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Lohman and Barkley were sitting in a bar speculating
about the two guys from Cleveland that Metromedia planned to hire to
replace Lohman in the morning slot.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Al, you're out and I'm out, so why don't we do a team
act and audition for your old morning job?' " Barkley said later.</TE>
<TE>   "Well those guys from Cleveland must have been bad, because we won
the job."</TE>
<TE>   It took a while before the team of Lohman and Barkley began paying
big dividends for listeners.</TE>
<TE>   When KLAC went to an all-talk format in 1967, the duo moved to
KFWB, and when that station went to all news in 1968, they found a
permanent home at KFI.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman and Barkley made two forays into local weekly television,
including a KNBC-TV Channel 4 variety comedy show from 1967 to 1970
that won them two local Emmy Awards, and a syndicated comedy-variety
show in the mid 1970s that lasted a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   They also appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show," "Hollywood Squares,"
and in 1969 were hosts on an afternoon NBC game show, "Name
Droppers."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman and Barkley often compared their professional relationship
to being married.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been together in Hollywood longer than most marriages,"
Lohman told The Times in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   But the marriage unexpectedly came to an end one morning in May
1986, when Barkley phoned in his resignation to KFI, shocking
management, listeners -- and his partner of 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley said at the time that he and Lohman had been "getting
along all right," but he was "getting to a point in my life where I
had to make a change. The strain of it--the hours, the stress and the
tradition--was getting to be too much for me."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a complete surprise, a complete wow-er," Lohman told The
Times. "I really still don't understand it, though I've had a few
days to mull it over now. If he's got a problem with it, I still
don't know what it was. But so far as I know, he wasn't unhappy with
me, nor I with him. I guess it just got to him, finally."</TE>
<TE>   Lohman's daughter, Kim, said Monday that her father and Barkley
never spoke to each other after the breakup, "which is a shame
because I think they really loved each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a painful loss for both Roger and my dad."</TE>
<TE>   After the breakup, Barkley became solo host of a morning show on
KJOI-FM (98.7) then teamed up with Ken Minyard on KABC-AM (790) from
1990 to 1996. He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997 at age 61.</TE>
<TE>   After short stints at a Simi Valley station and at KRLA-AM (870),
with Emperor Bob Hudson, Lohman returned to KFI in 1987 as co-host of
a morning show with Owens.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, however, Lohman and Owens were let go by KFI, which
had changed to a heavy news and talk format.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman did voice-overs and commercial work, returning to radio in
1990 to do a morning show on KPLM-FM (106.1) in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   He later became morning man at KCMJ-AM (1270) in Palm Springs and
did other work for the station's local affiliates through most of the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman, a Rancho Mirage resident, was frequently asked to emcee
big band nights and other events in Palm Springs, said Gary De
Maroney, director of program operations for Morris Desert Media,
which owns KCMJ.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people grew up with him, his icon status was large," said
De Maroney.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man full of life and knew how to live it and express it.
He could take the most serious situation and make you smile."</TE>
<TE>   Lohman is survived by his wife of 44 years, Mary Ann; a son, Al
Lohman III, of Branson, Mo.; his daughter, Kim, of Thousand Oaks; and
his sister, Martha Braithwaite of Sioux Falls, S.D.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that any donations be made to the American
Cancer Society.</TE>

<HD>Web Maps to Point to Sex Offenders' Neighborhoods</HD>
<DH>The Megan's Law information, to be posted starting Nov. 1,
won't include addresses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A computerized map showing general neighborhoods in Orange County
where convicted sexual offenders live will be available on the
Internet beginning Nov. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County supervisors approved the idea in August after the
kidnapping and murder of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, supervisors voted to begin providing the information
Nov. 1 even though maps of some of the county's 34 cities might not
be included.</LD>
<TE>   Each city must approve the posting of locations of sexual
offenders living there.</TE>
<TE>   There are 2,709 registered sex offenders countywide. The locations
will be shown as large circles in the vicinity of offenders' homes. A
disclaimer will notify anyone viewing the map that it is illegal to
harass registered sexual offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer pushed to immediately post the locations
of 64 offenders living in the county's unincorporated areas. But
other supervisors wanted the map to be more complete before making it
public. Cities are being asked to approve the inclusion of their
information in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The program is provided under Megan's Law, named for a 7-year-old
New Jersey girl who was raped and killed by a paroled sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   A database listing sex offenders is available via computers at
sheriff's substations. Residents must fill out and sign an
application to receive a sex offender's name, birth date, criminal
record and photo -- but no address.</TE>

<HD>2 Mexican Officers Found Dead in Trunk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bodies of two state police officers were found in the trunk of an
abandoned car in Tijuana blanketed with hundreds of dollar bills,
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Baja California state attorney general's office, which is
investigating, declined to speculate on what the money might mean.
But Donald Thornhill, spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration in San Diego, said, "I would say this is
characteristic of a drug hit. They're sending a message" to deter
others from crossing drug traffickers.</LD>
<LD>   The officers, Jorge Raul Cuara, 25, and Sergio Bravo Alfaro, 36,
left their office last Tuesday afternoon. They never returned.
Another officer who was with them, Carlos Lopez Avalos, is missing.</LD>
<TE>   The next morning, police in Tijuana's Zona Rio found the officers'
car. It was empty, but there was blood on the seats.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, police spotted a Volkswagen Passat that had been
reported stolen parked near the Universidad Autonoma de Baja
California. In the trunk, they found the bodies and about $350.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies have not been completed, but the men appear to have been
strangled, said Hamlet Alcantara, a spokesman for the state attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   Alcantara said the officers had not been working on a specific
investigation that would have put them in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this fall, a state police officer in Mexicali was
assassinated, Alcantara said.</TE>

<HD>Nike Takes Ad Liability Case to High Court</HD>
<DH>In arguing its appeal of a California ruling, the shoe firm
claims full free-speech rights in advertising without fear of being
sued for false or misleading statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court was urged Monday to give California
businesses full free-speech rights to defend themselves and their
business practices without fear of being sued.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Nike Inc. appealed a 4-3 ruling by the California
Supreme Court in May that said the Oregon-based maker of athletic
shoes could be held liable for false and misleading statements that
appeared in advertisements, press releases or newspaper opinion
columns.</LD>
<LD>   They said California was the only state that had stretched its law
against false advertising to include private suits that attack a
company's public statements.</LD>
<TE>   Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe and former Clinton
administration Solicitor Gen. Walter Dellinger filed the appeal on
Nike's behalf, portraying the case as a potential landmark in 1st
Amendment law and in the fight over globalization.</TE>
<TE>   They said companies that are attacked over their business
practices should be entitled to vigorously defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Uttering even a word would become far more risky than keeping
silent, if this ruling stands," Tribe said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the court had said that advertising and purely
"commercial speech" was not entitled to free-speech protections. But
in recent years, the justices have struck down a series of state laws
that restrict advertising.</TE>
<TE>   For example, they voided laws in Rhode Island and 10 other states
that forbade advertising of beer prices. They struck down a
Massachusetts law that prohibited cigarette billboards near schools
or parks.</TE>
<TE>   In those decisions, the court said the 1st Amendment protects
commercial speech, but the justices have not agreed on whether this
form of speech deserves the same constitutional shield as other
public and political statements.</TE>
<TE>   The California court said the key issue is truthfulness.</TE>
<TE>   "Our holding in no way prohibits any business enterprise from
speaking out on issues of public importance or from vigorously
defending its own labor practices," wrote Justice Joyce Kennard in
May. "It means only that when a business enterprise makes factual
representations about its own products or its own operations, it must
speak truthfully."</TE>
<TE>   The decision revived a lawsuit filed by San Francisco resident
Marc Kasky that asserts that Nike issued deceptive statements about
working conditions and wages in its overseas factories.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began with a 1996 report by CBS News that said workers
at Nike's factories in Asia were poorly paid, exposed to toxic
chemicals and subjected to physical abuse.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Nike responded with a report that its factories met
health, safety and labor standards, and that the shoe maker was
"operating morally."</TE>
<TE>   Kasky's suit contends that those assertions are false and
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   He is seeking a court order that would force Nike to turn over the
profits it has earned in California.</TE>
<TE>   "If a company is going to issue press releases, they are going to
have to tell the truth," said Alan Caplan, Kasky's lawyer. "That
shouldn't upset any corporation."</TE>
<TE>   The suit has yet to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal, Nike's lawyers said California courts have set a
double standard that is unfair to business.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are free to allege that Nike relies on Asian "sweatshops"
and virtual "slave" labor to make its products. Those statements,
whether entirely accurate or not, are fully protected as free speech.</TE>
<TE>   However, if Nike defends itself by asserting that its factories
comply with all health, safety and labor laws, it can be sued in
California by those who allege that Nike's assertions are
"misleading."</TE>
<TE>   It "is entirely one-sided," Tribe said.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision grants favored treatment to accusations against
companies," but handicaps the defenders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the court's rules, Kasky's lawyers have 30 days to file a
brief in response to the appeal in Nike vs. Kasky.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the court acts on the appeal several weeks after
receiving the response.</TE>

<HD>Terror Risk Stops Few Bali-Bound Surfers</HD>
<DH>Great waves lure them to Indonesia. Orange County man is
reported dead in nightclub blast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though a car bomb killed scores of people in Bali, many Southern
California surfers who travel to the Indonesian island in search of
perfect waves say they have no plans to stay away.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to say it doesn't scare me," said Nick Galvean, 19,
of Huntington Beach, who has saved $1,500 for a surf trip to
Indonesia in January. "But I would not let it hold me back. Bali is
amazing. There are great waves. There is great culture."</LD>
<LD>   For years, surfers from Australia, New Zealand and the United
States have traveled to Indonesia. The tropical island nation is
known among surfers for its generous people and dozens of good breaks
-- including Uluwatu, famous for its fast, curling waves that crash
over a coral reef.</LD>
<TE>   Shattering that image of exotic calm, a car bomb exploded Saturday
night in a popular nightclub district in Kuta, leaving at least 188
people dead, including an Orange County man, and nearly 500 injured.
Dozens are still missing, and the death toll is expected to rise as
authorities excavate the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   The Sari Club, which was destroyed, is frequented by surfers from
all over the world. Among them was Steven Brooks Webster, 41, of
Huntington Beach. Webster's best friend, Trent Walker of Newport
Beach, said family and friends "received confirmation of Steve's
death from the morgue in Bali" late Monday. He leaves behind his
wife, Mona, a 5-year-old son and a 15-year-old stepdaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's friend William Steven Cabler, 42, of Newport Beach was
injured; he returned home Monday with third-degree burns and a
dislocated shoulder. Traveling with them was John Frederick Parodi
Jr., 42, of Huntington Beach, who had left the bar and was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that arrange and book surf trips report that travel to
Indonesia has dropped off substantially since the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Nevertheless, though Islamic
radicals are active in Indonesia, many surfers are sticking to their
plans to visit Bali.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people want to reschedule trips or book other destinations,"
said Sean Murphy, the owner of Waterways Surf Adventures in Malibu,
which handles trips worldwide. "But there are still plenty of people
planning trips there."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said a group of 12 clients now traveling in Indonesia had
been at the Sari Club shortly before the bombing. They are older men,
he said, who have made no plans to cut short their stay.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Bonaponi, an Orange County college student who manages a surf
team sponsored by Katin surf wear, said he hopes to go to Bali soon,
although recent events have frightened him.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of the waves is what makes you want to go," said
Bonaponi, who looks forward to surfing up to six hours a day in Bali.
"The surf is hollow, and there is always size."</TE>
<TE>   For many the lure is understandable. Steve Pezman, editor and
publisher of the Surfer's Journal in San Clemente, says a trip to
Indonesia is still attractive. The odds of getting hurt or killed in
a violent incident are slim to none, he figures, and well worth
braving for the possibility of riding large, perfect waves in
uncrowded conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who travel will still travel," said Pezman, who has
chronicled surfing for decades. "They might change their
destinations, but a bunch of younger, rowdy guys might be impervious
to what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   One surfer posted an anonymous e-mail on Surfer Magazine's Web
site proclaiming it more attractive than ever. "I'm booking my
tickets now for Bali. You might get it uncrowded. After 9/11 things
were super empty. Maybe this time it will be totally empty.... I'm
just not going to let Osama take my waves away."</TE>
<TE>   Other surfers, however, are more cautious. A trip to Bali can
wait, they say, particularly given the increasing chance of war in
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not go there today. It's not worth giving up your life
for," said Chris Evans, a veteran surfer and executive director of
the Surfrider Foundation in San Clemente. "There are plenty of good
waves elsewhere in the world and in your own backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Tahiti, Fiji, Costa Rica, Mexico, Hawaii, Australia and islands in
the Indian Ocean remain popular options for surfers from the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Nelsen, 30, of Laguna Beach said he regularly traveled to
Indonesia before the Sept. 11 attacks and routinely went to the Sari
Club and Patty's, another surfer hangout. Now he goes to Fiji and
Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   "The waves are world-class. There is warm water. The Indonesian
people are amazing. The Sari Club was a fun place to go. There was
good music, and it had a huge dance floor," Nelsen said. "I don't
think I would go back. I just don't know what is going to happen."</TE>

<HD>Separate Police Shootings Kill 1, Injure 1</HD>
<DH>Officers in both of the cases say they fired in
self-defense. The LAPD is investigating the weekend incidents.</DH>

<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Separate shootings by Los Angeles police officers who said they fired
in self-defense, leaving one man dead and another wounded, were under
investigation, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   One man who had stabbed a woman in a domestic dispute was fatally
shot Sunday, and a man who led police on a high-speed chase was
wounded Saturday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Brian Dameworth, 31, responded with his partner to a
report of a domestic disturbance Sunday morning at a Hollywood
apartment in the 1700 block of Garfield Place. A woman who had been
stabbed in the neck said her attacker was inside her apartment.</LD>
<TE>   As Dameworth and his partner approached the apartment, Albert
Davila screamed words suggesting he was going to kill himself, police
said. The officers kicked in the door, saw Davila with a knife and
ordered him to drop it.</TE>
<TE>   With a beer bottle in one hand and a knife in the other, Davila
advanced toward Dameworth, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "Officer Dameworth backed up and repeatedly pleaded with the
suspect to put down the knife and return to the apartment," said Lt.
Horace Frank.</TE>
<TE>   Dameworth, an officer for 18 months, told investigators that his
back was against a wall when Davila "continued to advance in a
threatening manner." Dameworth shot Davila, who was declared dead at
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In the second incident, officers Ernest Berry and Alfred Gonzalez
shot Ever Castillo, 22, Saturday when he threatened police after a
high-speed chase from southeast Los Angeles to Hacienda Heights,
police said. Castillo remained hospitalized Monday in serious
condition. Berry, 36, a six-year veteran, had previously been given a
15-day suspension for shooting at an officer he said he had mistaken
for a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, whom police sought on suspicion of reckless driving, was
chased from the Nickerson Gardens housing project to the 15800 block
of Novak Street in Hacienda Heights, police said.</TE>
<TE>   There he was stopped. Officers fired a beanbag through the car
window after Castillo refused to obey orders to get out, police said.
When Castillo left the car, he brandished a glass candelabrum, and
officers Fiji Yamamoto, 33, and Scott Burkett, 33, fired more beanbag
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Officers told investigators that Castillo continued to scream and
then charged Gonzalez, 32. Gonzalez and Berry fired at Castillo with
bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Both shootings were being investigated by the LAPD and the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office.</TE>

<LD>Oh, waiter: Manhattan Beach police officers arrested two women who
were "attempting to steal a rose bush from a restaurant," the Beach
Reporter newspaper said. I wonder if the suspects first asked for a
large doggie bag. And some gloves.</LD>
<LD>   Haunting refrain: Oldsters and movie buffs will recall the 1953
Western classic, "Shane," which ends with the hero riding off into
the sunset while a youngster yells, "Shane, come back! Come back,
Shane!" Shane Snyder of Costa Mesa certainly recalled it, especially
when he received one of those personalized computer messages from a
company he used to patronize (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   I beg your pardon! Nancy and Joe Hart received an invitation from
an organization with a suggestive name (see accompanying). I won't
reveal the name of the bedroom community in which it's located.</LD>
<TE>   Related item? Mark Steinberg received an e-mail from a Web site
that apologized for technical difficulties, then made this risque
declaration: "Please bare with us as we try to resolve this issue."</TE>
<TE>   There'll always be a place for them here: A sign in front of a
sandwich shop prompted Henry Weiss of Rowland Heights to write that
his first thought was that it meant "parking for Raiders' fans only"
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Pat Harris of Camarillo saw an ad for a
ladder that is supposed to be pretty sturdy, considering that it's
less than a foot tall (see accompanying). At that size, not sure it
really needs to be "slip resistant," either.</TE>
<TE>   Sports -- of all types: San Diego State ranks No. 10 on Playboy
magazine's list of the "top 25 party schools," the only other local
being UC Santa Barbara (No. 22). All state residents can take some
pride in the fact, however, that Cal State Chico is No. 2 (right
behind Arizona State).</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State and UC Santa Barbara didn't fare as well in Sports
Illustrated's rankings of "America's best sports colleges" coming in
at No. 126 and No. 127, respectively (if not respectfully).</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't find Caltech in either set of rankings, though I was
reminded of the team's famous football cheer: "Secant, cosine,
tangent, sine/ Logarithm, logarithm, hyperbolic sine/
3-point-1-4-1-5-9/ Slipstick, slide rule/ TECH! TECH! TECH!" That's
because Sports Illustrated said that Georgia Tech fans have a
variation: "Differential Y, differential X/To hell with
differentials/ We want sex!" Oddly enough, Georgia Tech didn't make
Playboy's list.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: So what was next for KCBS (Channel 2) reporter Dave
Lopez after weeks of traveling back and forth to San Diego to cover
the David Westerfield murder trial?</TE>
<TE>   Lopez received a summons for jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   He duly reported and was put in a pool for a trial -- a murder
trial -- but was bumped from the jury, thus completing his
obligation.</TE>
<TE>   He went on vacation afterward. It was definitely time for a change
of venue.</TE>

<HD>Superintendent Removed From Channel Islands</HD>
<DH>The national park's aggressive manager is sent to Oakland
office without explanation. The move has some activists worried about
the fate of projects.</DH>

<LD>Tim Setnicka, the hard-charging, controversial superintendent of
Channel Islands National Park, was abruptly transferred last week,
leaving his professional future and that of several major island
restoration projects in limbo.</LD>
<LD>   Setnicka, head of the five-island park and marine sanctuary park
since 1997, will work in the National Park Service's western regional
office in Oakland, where he will perform as yet unexplained duties,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't know the reasons why, but this happens with park service
people," said Tom Dore, spokesman for the park. "The job in Oakland
is not permanent. We don't know what he will be doing yet. He seemed
happy when I talked to him. Maybe a combination of his skills are
needed for another job; we just don't know."</LD>
<TE>   Chief ranger Jack Fitzgerald will serve as acting superintendent
until a permanent replacement is found.</TE>
<TE>   Setnicka, an Ojai Valley resident, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes at a critical time for the park, which has animal
and plant species found nowhere else in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing projects that could be affected include an aggressive
campaign to kill rats that feed on seabird eggs on Anacapa Island. On
Santa Cruz, the largest of the islands, rangers are trapping golden
eagles, restoring bald eagles and planning to shoot 4,000 wild pigs.
Meanwhile, plans are underway to expand camping and hiking facilities
on two of the islands.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things going on at the Channel Islands, and I
have a great deal of worry about a change in leadership," said Greg
Helms of the Ocean Conservancy in Santa Barbara, a national group
dedicated to maintaining ocean ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget that resource management has a lot to do with
individual people and relationships," he said. "To that extent it
will be a blow to us."</TE>
<TE>   Setnicka, an avid rock climber, diver and kayaker originally from
Chicago, became superintendent after nearly 30 years as a park ranger
in Alaska, Hawaii, Florida, Wyoming and California.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a reputation for being tough -- someone who identifies a
problem and attacks it full force. But his brusque style sometimes
backfired, leading critics to call him arrogant and overly
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   The most glaring example of this was a 1997 raid on two
sheep-hunting camps on Santa Cruz Island. Twenty heavily armed
federal and local law enforcement officers descended on the camps in
a Blackhawk helicopter after getting reports that hunting guides had
destroyed Chumash graves and others were operating without licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel he gave the park service a real black eye," said Jaret
Owens of Oxnard, who organized sheep hunts on Santa Cruz. "I have
gone on with my life, but this guy destroyed my business."</TE>
<TE>   Andre Barclay, a ranch manager in Carpinteria, was so distressed
by the raid that he started a Web site dedicating to attacking
Setnicka.</TE>
<TE>   "After the raid, I felt he was an irresponsible person," he said.
"The guy was out of control."</TE>
<TE>   But others supported the action.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going on a hunting ranch where people have guns; I can't
fault them for their method," said Julie Tumamait-Stenslie, a Chumash
tribal member. She has worked closely with Setnicka to help preserve
Native American archeology and history on the islands.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had a generous ear for our community and for what we
wanted to accomplish," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Helms said he liked Setnicka's blunt style but worried about how
others perceived it.</TE>

<HD>Planning Issues Offer Insight Into Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup supporters say smaller cities would be more
responsive on questions of growth and development.</DH>
<SE>Third in a series on Los Angeles city services.</SE>
<AU>Sue Fox</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who killed Chuck E. Cheese? In Woodland Hills, look no further than
the neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   It might seem benign enough: a proposal to open a family
restaurant filled with coin-operated children's games in a Ventura
Boulevard mini-mall. Under the city's old planning rules, the
restaurant might have sailed through.</LD>
<LD>   But Chuck E. Cheese's case last year sparked a storm of opposition
from residents living in a tidy neighborhood of single-family homes
nearby. The complaints could have been lifted from the minutes of
just about any San Fernando Valley homeowner group: inadequate
parking, traffic, blight, noise and alcohol. Even the kiddie games
became flash points.</LD>
<TE>   The conflict--and how it was resolved--offers lessons as Los
Angeles voters prepare to decide whether to break up their city. Of
all the services that Valley and Hollywood secessionists vow to
improve, the city planning process is already in the throes of a
voter-approved overhaul aimed at making it more responsive to local
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot come just three years
after voters adopted a new City Charter that created advisory
neighborhood councils and seven area planning commissions to make
land-use decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of Valley secession helped drive charter reform, and
the revamped Planning Department was a response to years of grumbling
from people who felt they had little control over what was built in
their neighborhoods. While secessionists applaud the new system, they
say a smaller city would be even more responsive.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by the mayor, area planning commission members live in
the area they serve. They are likely to know the places where
projects are being proposed--and to understand the concerns of the
residents and businesses there.</TE>
<TE>   After the debate over Chuck E. Cheese erupted, it was the South
Valley Area Planning Commission that settled it.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent was to bring decision-making closer to the
communities," said Con Howe, director of the Department of City
Planning. Among major cities, he added, "there's no other system like
this in the country."</TE>
<TE>   So far, according to a Planning Department report, the new
commissions are working well. They meet twice a month in the late
afternoons in the regions they serve, boosting public participation.
The system gives commissioners more time to focus on individual
cases, Howe said.</TE>
<TE>   The South Valley Area Planning Commission has handled more than a
third of the cases citywide. Its meetings often last more than four
hours, occasionally ending after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the fate of Chuck E. Cheese's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant wanted a permit to serve beer and wine. But
residents said their area was already saturated with liquor permits.</TE>
<TE>   "Encouraging adults to become inebriated while children are
playing in a restaurant invites irresponsible and reckless behavior,"
one resident, Raymond Asher, wrote in a letter to city planners.</TE>
<TE>   A commercial property owner at the mini-mall joined the fight,
hiring a lawyer to argue against sharing parking spaces with future
Chuck E. Cheese customers. Neighbors, already miffed about trash and
graffiti in the shopping center's alley, sent city planners photos of
overflowing dumpsters and warned that a new restaurant would only
make things messier.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the arcade--hardly a den of vice packed with
violent video games, but nonetheless considered a special use under
Los Angeles zoning rules. Opponents argued that an arcade could
attract rowdy teenagers from nearby Taft High School.</TE>
<TE>   The case went to a zoning administrator, who denied a
conditional-use permit to serve alcohol and a zoning variance to
allow the arcade in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old planning system, appeals of such decisions were
heard by a citywide Board of Zoning Appeals. The new charter
eliminated that board. Now, many appeals go to an area planning
commission similar to the one that heard Chuck E. Cheese's case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough decision, let me tell you," said then-Commissioner
Tony Lucente. "You want to support economic development, but on the
other hand you want to protect people's neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the restaurant's last-minute withdrawal of its request for
an alcohol permit, the commission voted down the proposal in July
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "You're answering to your peers," said Lucente, who is also a
Studio City homeowner leader. "There's a greater level of
accountability. You're answering to your neighborhood. You drive by
[the project]; you've got to live with your decisions."</TE>
<TE>   David Braun, one of the residents who fought Chuck E. Cheese's
proposal, said the community felt that its voice was heard.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any political process, it had its ups and downs," said
Braun, a Pierce College professor. "We really put quite a bit of
pressure on. It took a while, but we certainly felt we had a fair day
in court."</TE>
<TE>   Praise for the Process</TE>
<TE>   Even the lawyer who handled Chuck E. Cheese's appeal had praise
for the city's revamped planning process.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I was on the losing end of that one, I still think
the process is good," said Benjamin Reznik, a veteran land-use
attorney. "The area planning commissions have demanded a higher level
of proof for projects ... I don't know how much more local control
you need, if you can keep Chuck E. Cheese's out of a shopping center
on Ventura Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   So far, secessionists have not presented a detailed vision for
city planning. Most of their campaign has focused on improving public
safety, education and government responsiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Planning</TE>
<TE>   But city planning--or the lack thereof--touches on many of the
secessionists' complaints. In the Valley, rapid development in the
1950s transformed ranchland and citrus groves into suburban tracts.
As the population passed 1 million in the 1960s, freeways opened more
areas to development, and apartment buildings began to replace
single-family homes, dramatically increasing the density of older
neighborhoods such as North Hollywood and Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the Valley's bad karma is it was developed before there
was a lot of consciousness" about city planning, said Joel Kotkin, a
senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at
Pepperdine University, who has studied the Valley's growth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that the city of Los Angeles did all these big, bad
things to the Valley," he said. "It's just that people weren't
thinking ahead. There was so much open land that people didn't think
it was important to preserve it."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the city Planning Department has adopted a new
general plan and updated 35 community plans. All the Valley plans are
done, said director Howe, and only three others have yet to be
finished: Silver Lake/Echo Park, Westchester and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the city is handling more cases with fewer planners than in
years past. About 15 years ago, Howe said, Los Angeles had 370
planners; today, there are 273. Meanwhile, the number of zoning cases
has jumped from 1,100 to 1,400 per year over the past decade.
Developers have complained that L.A.'s planning process is too slow.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scott, a Valley secessionist who served on the citywide
Planning Commission for 10 years, agreed that the new system has
helped empower communities. In a Valley city, he added, planning
decisions would be even more closely tied to local needs because the
city would be smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "Planning in the city of Los Angeles is really a misnomer," Scott
said. "Most of the time, we're dealing with exceptions to the plan.
Some person wants to build an apartment building and the setback is
25 feet, but he wants it to be 20 feet so he can fit more units in.
And we sit there and haggle about it. Now, that's not what I would
call planning. That's more like case management."</TE>
<TE>   One possible model a new city could turn to is the Vision 2020
plan developed by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.
That blueprint envisions a series of "town centers" across the
Valley, featuring shopping, dining, entertainment and other services,
all within walking distance of each other.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood--one of the few areas in Los Angeles that still lacks
a community plan--secessionists also hope to create more
pedestrian-friendly areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking very seriously at mixed-use development, where we
have shops on the lower level and apartments on the upper floors,"
said Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra. "That will encourage
more walking and a village-type atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the planning system chosen, squabbles like the one
over Chuck E. Cheese's proposal are certain to continue, especially
in pockets with active homeowner groups.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighbors don't want this, the neighbors don't want that,"
said Sandy Paris, an industrial park developer and past president of
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. "That is the problem and, frankly,
secession isn't going to solve it."</TE>
<TE>   Developers' Influence</TE>
<TE>   What might change, he said, is the sway developers hold over City
Council members, influence often cemented with generous donations of
campaign cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason [developers] don't want secession is that they can
talk to a councilman from San Pedro, who probably doesn't even know
where Ventura Boulevard is, and get his vote," said Paris, who favors
Valley cityhood. "But in a Valley city, they couldn't do that."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Flattered, but Won't Mount a Write-in Campaign</HD>
<DH>Former mayor says 'thousands' in both parties have asked
him to get back in the race.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan announced Monday that he
will not seek to be a write-in candidate for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Although he was flattered by calls from Republicans and Democrats
urging him to jump into the race, Riordan told The Times, he
concluded that such a move would not be a good idea for him or the
state.</LD>
<LD>   "To do something this disruptive, your ego has to become more
important than the end result, and my ego hasn't become that large,"
Riordan, who lost to Bill Simon Jr. in the March GOP primary, said in
an interview.</LD>
<TE>   By ruling out a last-minute campaign, Riordan removed one of the
distractions facing Simon as he heads into the final three weeks of
the race.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign stumbled badly last week when the candidate had
to retract an unfounded allegation that Gov. Gray Davis had illegally
accepted a political donation in a state office. Republican
consultants openly bemoaned the state of Simon's candidacy, giving
rise to a new round of rumors that Riordan might be enticed into the
race as an alternative to Simon and Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he has been lobbied by "thousands" of people,
including a group of Democrats he met with last week in San
Francisco, to get back in the race. "You think, 'This is not the
right thing to do,' and then all of a sudden your ego gets
flattered," he said. "But then you come back to Earth."</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor said his biggest concern with waging a write-in
candidacy was with the concept of running as an independent outside
the party system.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could pull a New Jersey and be on the ballot, that'd be a
big difference," he said, referring to the recent departure of
Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli from the New Jersey senatorial
race. Torricelli dropped out and will be replaced on the ballot by
former Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has until Oct. 22 to declare his intention to run as a
write-in candidate. Write-in candidates must file papers with the
secretary of state's office attesting to their desire to run, or else
ballots containing their name will not be counted.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he wanted to, Simon could not take his name off the ballot
this close to the election. On Monday, before he knew of Riordan's
decision, Simon said he had no intention of walking away from his
gubernatorial bid.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican nominee made a brief stop Monday at an Italian
restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, where he and former New
York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani marked Columbus Day with a
gathering of about 100 Simon supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the possibility of quitting the race in favor of
Riordan, the GOP nominee smiled as a chorus of boos and catcalls
crescendoed through the tightly packed room. Then he exclaimed, "We
are going to win this election on November the fifth."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said that despite Simon's missteps, the Republican nominee
still has a chance to win because voters are dissatisfied with Davis.
He suggested that Simon spend the next three weeks emphasizing his
role as a family man and charity leader. "He's got to somehow let the
people know that there's a special side of Bill Simon, and somehow
he's failed to do that," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Riordan said he plans to spend the next few years
focusing on reforming the education system and spurring the
development of affordable housing. He is working on creating a think
tank to advise local governments about how to combat terrorism. And,
he said, he still intends to launch a newspaper in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Latino Council Majority for Santa Ana?</HD>
<DH>Change would reflect the city's demographics, but experts
doubt it would mean bloc voting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's any heat being generated in the race for Santa Ana City
Council, it's the friction between Mike Garcia, the candidate
supported by the city's Establishment, and maverick Eleazar Elizondo,
who brings political experience from working for several state
representatives.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the two men, who are among six candidates running
for the open seat in the city's Ward 6, have many differences on the
issues. Elizondo advocates spending more city money on after-school
programs; Garcia has begun to support the idea too.</LD>
<LD>   The essential difference is that Garcia has endorsements from
elected city officials and the city's fire and police organizations,
while Elizondo is running against the status quo.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, there is a chance that a Latino city council
majority could emerge from the Nov. 5 election for the first time in
a city where 76% of the population is Latino. Four Latinos are among
10 candidates competing for three council seats. The victors will
join incumbents Brett Franklin, Claudia C. Alvarez, Jose Solorio and
Mayor Miguel A. Pulido, who is unopposed in his bid for a third term.</TE>
<TE>   A Latino majority would reflect the increasing number of Latino
voters in the city. The Redondo Beach-based AMAC political consulting
firm reports that 47% of Santa Ana's 80,990 voters are Latino, based
on a study of surnames. Just three years ago, there were only 65,237
voters in Santa Ana, AMAC analyst Steve Sammarco said. He estimates
that 6,000 of the 15,753 new voters are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   In Ward 2, in central Santa Ana, incumbent Lisa Bist, first
elected in 1998, faces a challenge from newcomer Jose Macias.</TE>
<TE>   Macias, 25, a recent San Diego State University graduate who quit
his job as a sales representative to run, said he is seeking office
to "get the word out that we have a lot of people who are not
involved in the community and their views are not being considered."</TE>
<TE>   He advocates that the city begin printing a Spanish-language
newsletter to distribute to residents.</TE>
<TE>   Macias, who reported raising $101 by the Sept. 30 filing deadline,
wants more low-income housing, improvements made to the city's three
library branches and expansion of after-school programs to prevent
children from joining gangs. He is using the Internet to get his
message out.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Bist, 43, one of the founders of the Wilshire Square
neighborhood group in 1987, has focused on neighborhood improvements
and code enforcement, while supporting the Artists Village and
downtown revitalization in her first term. She recently was named the
city's representative to the Orange County Transportation Authority's
Center Line Corridor Advisory Panel, and supports that project.</TE>
<TE>   Bist said she wants more money spent on "neighborhood
infrastructure and improvements, parks programming and staffing, and
recreation services programming, as well as our library services."
She has raised $25,802.</TE>
<TE>   In Ward 4, in the west-central part of the city, Zeke Hernandez,
president of Santa Ana's chapter of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, is trying to defeat incumbent Alberta D. Christy.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, 56, who has run unsuccessfully several times over 30
years, said he is trying again because he wants "to see if, as a City
Council member, I can make changes to the city of Santa Ana to cut
wasteful spending and spend money on parks and recreation,
neighborhood infrastructure and roads."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who had raised $1,973 by Sept. 30, also said the city
library system needs more books, librarians and other resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a sorry system that needs to be upgraded," he said. "It
needs to be improved to tie into our motto as the Education City."</TE>
<TE>   As a council member, Hernandez said he would try to blunt the
influence of developers on decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   For Christy, 57, a second term would allow her to focus on
improving the city's economic base, as well as on public safety and
neighborhood improvements. Although crime has recently jumped in
Santa Ana, Christy noted it still is below levels of 10 years ago.
She said she wants to keep it down by spending on technology and
other resources for the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Christy, who has raised $17,925, takes credit for helping create
the city's new Youth Commission, a new Youth Expo event and a program
that provides a children's book to new mothers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ward 6, the field is larger because there is no incumbent.
Councilwoman Patricia A. McGuigan is ineligible to run after serving
three four-year terms. Besides Elizondo and Garcia, the others vying
for her seat are Stanley Fiala, Margaret Jeanne Flindt, Robert L.
Henson Sr. and Jennifer Villasenor.</TE>
<TE>   Villasenor, 24, who has raised $900, is trying to appeal to young
voters. As a child, she said, she heard politics discussed at her
kitchen table because her father was active in the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.</TE>
<TE>   The planner for the city of Rosemead also supports more
after-school programs for youths. "We have to be concerned about
public safety," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Henson, 68, a retired aerospace worker and veteran community
activist, said he was encouraged to run by members of Riverview West
Neighborhood Assn., where he is a director.</TE>
<TE>   He is campaigning for improved road conditions, crackdowns on
residential code violations and on vagrants who congregate on Harbor
Boulevard near McFadden Avenue, and on prostitution along Harbor
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "I would first like to see more improvements to the neglected
parts of our city," said Henson, who has raised $5,906. "I would like
to see more code enforcement because it affects property value. I
would like to see more businesses in the area, especially on Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Stanley Fiala, 56, founder of EON, a company that seeks
to stop the aging process, said he is running to move the city in a
new direction. He said he has raised $300.</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Ana resident for 15 years, Fiala advocates replacing
Police Chief Paul M. Walters with a leader who wants to rehabilitate
drug offenders instead of arrest them. He also believes the city
should "highlight [Mexican] culture and take advantage of it, like
Plaza Olvera [in Los Angeles] instead of pushing [immigrants] aside
and arresting people who sell things on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Flindt, an office manager who specializes in making
dental offices more efficient and profitable, said she is running
because she feels some of the other candidates "don't have the time
to dedicate to the job." Flindt, 42, said the city's ethnic groups
should be unified by city efforts.</TE>
<TE>   She said she won't accept campaign contributions to avoid being
compromised, and if elected, will work on improving the city's image,
its roads, sidewalks and soccer fields.</TE>
<TE>   If money is an indicator, Garcia and Elizondo are the
front-runners in the Ward 6 race. Garcia reported raising $26,107;
Elizondo has $17,295.</TE>
<TE>   Elizondo, 30, has been on a ballot before, garnering 25,000 votes
when he ran for county supervisor in 2000. Now a public affairs
consultant and vice president of the board of the Neighborhood
Housing Services of Orange County, he has worked for U.S. Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles)
and Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim).</TE>
<TE>   He believes the city should apply for public and foundation funds
to offer more after-school and day care services. He said more
programs would help reduce crime, teen pregnancy and high school
dropouts, problems he believes are plaguing the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Ana is the youngest city of its size in the country,"
Elizondo said. "We have over 60,000 young people, and I am worried
about gangs, drugs and graffiti."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 30, worked as an economic development specialist in Santa
Ana for five years until 1998. With his experience at his current job
with a Santa Ana-based planning consulting firm, he said he knows how
other city governments work and can be a more effective council
member.</TE>
<TE>   He is campaigning for stronger public safety programs as well as
more redevelopment and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 10-plus years working in the public sector," said Garcia,
who has been endorsed by some current council members, the local
chamber of commerce, the Firemen's Benevolent Assn. of Santa Ana and
Santa Ana Police Officers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Pulido, 46, who has been mayor since 1994 and faces no term
limits, has not responded to numerous requests for comment on what he
hopes to achieve during another term. A secretary in his office said
he has nothing to discuss since he is running unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   By June, he had raised $66,849 for the uncontested race, more than
double the amount raised by any other candidate. Eileen Padberg, the
mayor's campaign consultant, said Pulido raised the funds before he
knew he had no opposition.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement for a voters guide, Pulido wrote: "We have a
detailed plan to continue reducing crime, invigorating our business
districts and revitalizing our neighborhoods. I want you to be proud
of the choice you've made to live in Santa Ana."</TE>
<TE>   Pulido has said he doesn't see himself as a Latino mayor, but as a
mayor who represents everyone. He and the other Latinos on the
council do not always agree on issues. If one of the Latino
challengers for the three council seats is elected, political
observers say, a Latino majority on the council won't necessarily
translate into a consistent vote on all issues.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, chairman of Santa Ana Neighborhood Communication
Linkages, an umbrella group of 57 neighborhood groups in the city,
said, "The beauty is that we will see everyone as an individual
instead of a bloc with a unified opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Fred Smoller, chairman of the political science
department at Chapman University in Orange, said the election of a
Latino majority to the Santa Ana council would be an "historical
milestone."</TE>
<TE>   "There is underrepresentation of Latinos all over Orange County,
so it is important for that reason," Smoller said.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has dismissed a California Farm Bureau
lawsuit that sought to preserve the industry's exemption from federal
air pollution regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had moved to end that
longtime exemption.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the suit because
of a lack of jurisdiction, said Brent Newell, an attorney for the
Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment.</LD>
<TE>   The Farm Bureau, which represents 95,000 farmers, wants the air
pollution exemption continued for three years so more studies can
determine how much pollution farmers create.</TE>
<TE>   Farm Bureau President Bill Pauli said the organization plans to
file another appeal.</TE>

<LD>The state Department of Social Services has issued 13 citations to a
private rehabilitation camp in the Sierra foothills for violating
youths' rights.</LD>
<LD>   Officials charge that 80 delinquent boys at the Sierra Ridge
athletic camp were forced to run on days when the temperature
exceeded 100 degrees, were subjected to waits as long as two hours
for a three-minute shower and required to sit motionless for 15
minutes as punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Howell, executive director of Nevada-based Rite of
Passage, which runs the camp, said such citations are to be expected
in any program handling delinquent teenagers.</LD>

<LD>A computer sales scam was allegedly run by students at UC Santa
Barbara, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   An FBI and Sheriff's Department investigation determined that
online shoppers nationwide placed orders with Gaucho Computers, which
had a UC Santa Barbara e-mail address and listed the University of
California as the company name.</LD>
<LD>   After shoppers paid an average of $2,000 for an Apple laptop,
William Franceschine and his roommates allegedly sent e-mail messages
indicating that customers would receive their order within seven
days, Det. Adam Reichick said. The laptops were never sent,

<HD>Mayor Won't Address Valley Business Leaders</HD>
<DH>Hahn says a scheduling conflict prevents annual speech.
Group's vice chairman calls it a snub of members for their support of
secession.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has decided not to deliver the
keynote speech at an annual San Fernando Valley business conference,
breaking a nine-year mayoral tradition and drawing complaints from
its sponsors that Hahn is snubbing them for supporting secession.</LD>
<LD>   Word of Hahn's decision came as several entertainment industry
unions announced their opposition to secession Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders held a rally against secession Monday, saying that
splitting up the city would hurt efforts to halt runaway production
and result in reduced arts funding in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn cited a scheduling conflict in bowing out of the "State of
the Valley" speech at the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.'s
Business Forecast Conference on Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The group recently went against the mayor's wishes and endorsed
San Fernando Valley cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an intentional snub, not just to VICA but to the
Valley," said Robert Scott, the group's vice chairman. "It's a little
childish for the mayor to take this posture when this is such an
important event."</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Fred Gaines said the mayor would miss a great opportunity
to make his case against the breakup to 500 Valley business leaders
just four days before the election on Valley and Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed he cannot be with us," Gaines said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group had asked the mayor's staff in January to put
the event on his schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The group later sent out fliers with the mayor's picture to
promote his participation.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, a political advisor to the mayor, said Hahn never
confirmed that he would attend the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a scheduling conflict, and the mayor offered a couple of
other dates instead," Kuwata said. He said he did not know where Hahn
will be during the conference. Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain said
Hahn's treatment of the business group indicates that the mayor, even
after the election, will hold a grudge against some secession
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has agreed to outline his vision for Hollywood on Oct. 22 at
a luncheon given by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which opposes
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, entertainment industry unions held a small
anti-secession rally in Studio City on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The central reason for people in the entertainment industry [to
oppose secession] is it creates a mass of uncertainty when we really
need a united response to globalization and runaway production," said
John Connolly, president of the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists.</TE>
<TE>   The unions released a study that says the entertainment industry
accounts for 185,000 jobs in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp. and the County Federation of Labor and conducted by a research
arm of the federation. Both are supporting Hahn's anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The review said there is no evidence that secession will benefit
the industry and that a new Valley city might not have revenue to
help reduce runaway production, which is when studios take movie and
television production out of the Los Angeles region.</TE>
<TE>   "With a more difficult production environment in Los Angeles,
producers will be likely to shoot elsewhere until the Valley and
Hollywood have stabilized," said Bruce Doering, national executive
director of the International Cinematographers Guild, Local 600.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists said the unions and the study are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally without foundation," Brain said. "Los Angeles has
chased the entertainment industry out of the city already."</TE>
<TE>   Brain noted that secession leaders and most major candidates for
office in the proposed Valley city support business tax cuts and a
streamlined process for film permits.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley city is going to make it more welcome for the film
industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brain also complained that it appeared city workers helped close
streets and direct parking for the anti-secession rally. He said the
Valley cityhood campaign will file a complaint with the state
attorney general, alleging illegal use of city resources to fight
secession. City officials did not return calls for comment.</TE>

<HD>Simon Forged His Future in Dad's Formidable Path</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate learned to be studious but fun-loving as
he met high expectations.</DH>
<SE>One in a series profiling Bill Simon Jr.</SE>
<AU>David Ferrell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps no single test, not even a surprise campaign to be
governor of California, surpassed the challenge that Bill Simon Jr.
faced during childhood: learning to handle Dad.</LD>
<LD>   His father was not just the shaper of staunch Catholic values and
a tough-minded work ethic. He was a mercurial force who often
terrorized the seven Simon children. His rages came on like
lightning. Even his fun-loving pranks had an edge: One was "the water
treatment," a practice of waking his children on Saturday mornings by
dumping buckets of water over their heads.</LD>
<LD>   "He liked to create chaos -- and he did," the 51-year-old
gubernatorial candidate said of his late father, the former U.S.
Treasury secretary under Richard Nixon.  "We used to joke that some days
he'd come home and say, 'How come no lights are on? This place is a
mausoleum!'  And the next night he'd come home and the lights would be on,
and he'd say, 'What am I doing, supporting the utility?'</LD>
<TE>   Simon laughs long and loud at the memories, even rising from a
chair to demonstrate the overblown way that his father dealt with an
employee's messy desk -- by sweeping every last pencil and message
slip onto the floor. "One thing for sure," remembers Simon, who is
said to exhibit occasional flashes of Dad's volatility, "you did what
my father said."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, there were moments of injustice, years of
intimidation, pressures that might have bred rebellion in an eldest
son. Yet "Billy," as Simon Jr. was known to the family, excelled at
meeting the lofty expectations. He is a product of the Simon name and
its disparate influences: With the stabilizing presence of his
mother, Carol, grew a strong sense of security and self-esteem. The
camaraderie of his siblings burnished the fun-loving facets of his
personality. And deep inside, always, was a serious child whose
course would parallel his father's.</TE>
<TE>   The father was a sports buff; Billy played high school football
and collegiate tennis and squash. The father was a bond dealer who
became a millionaire by age 40; Billy spent his early adulthood in
the Wall Street currency trade, and later, with brother Peter,
ascended to the co-chairmanship of their father's firm, William E.
Simon &amp; Sons. The father was a benefactor of charities; Billy
continues the work. The father served government as administrator of
the Federal Energy Office, in the early 1970s, and later as Treasury
secretary; only months after his father's death in June 2000, Billy
announced that he would bid for elected office, vying to unseat
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis despite having no previous political
experience.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Simon took to his father's path naturally,
combining childlike enthusiasm with a stellar work ethic. He
instigated food fights, antagonized his sisters -- one trick was to
flip his eyelids inside out -- and on occasion joined his father in
giving them the water treatment. And yet, when it was time to study,
he labored long into the night.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, their father would often sit down for gin rummy or
dominoes with the other siblings. They would look around and Billy
would be gone, having drifted upstairs, to the third-floor attic
bedroom he shared with Peter, to steep himself in history, literature
and algebra.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard conversations, 'Billy, go up and do your homework,'
" said sister Mary Streep, who remembers him as a consistent A
student in high school. "It was just within him. He automatically did
it. He was totally motivated and geared up to be the best that he
could be and make his parents proud."</TE>
<TE>   Simon names Albert Schweitzer first when asked about his early
heroes. The others are mainly sports stars, reflecting a childhood
spent mostly at the tennis courts, ball fields and swimming pools of
suburban New Jersey. He kept statuettes of Mickey Mantle and Joe
DiMaggio -- he favored the Yankees -- and hung his walls with
Princeton pennants. He admired Princeton basketball star Bill
Bradley, tennis great Rod Laver, and a fictional literary character
named Chip Hilton, an all-American kid who was a great athlete and
superior student.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Simon has had the chance to meet Bradley -- best
known now as a former presidential hopeful -- and even play tennis
with Laver. Aspects of Simon's life have a fairy-tale cast to them:
There's something of Hilton in his makeup, sterling qualities that
surely would make his father proud.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not All Perfection</TE>
<TE>   However, hard realities have marred the record. Simon's first
marriage failed; he stays in touch with his grown daughter from that
union mostly by telephone. Fraud charges against the family
investment firm have damaged his campaign, though a $78-million
verdict against the company was reversed in Los Angeles Superior
Court. Last week, he levied and was forced to retract an unfounded
accusation about Davis' fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he comes across in personal meetings as likable, a
conscientious family man. He and his wife, Cindy, have three
children, including a son named William E. Simon III. Before the
campaign cut into his time, Simon liked to surf and play basketball.
He maintains friendships that date to his early teens. "He's very
comfortable and real," said John C. Morrissey, a neighbor in Pacific
Palisades who met him about 12 years ago. "As you get to know him,
you understand the depth of his character, how carefully he thinks
about things."</TE>
<TE>   As a personality, Simon is tough to fit in a box. "I don't think
he has any one speed," Morrissey said. "He's a very thoughtful guy
when it's time to be thoughtful, and he's fun and frivolous when it's
time to be fun and frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, perhaps befitting the role of underdog, seems much more
open, easier to know, than the more imperious Davis. In background,
they are remarkably similar -- products of large, devout Catholic
families, country club wealth and rigorous private schools. They even
hail from the same region of the Northeast -- in Simon's case
suburban Spring Lake, N.J., where he was born in 1951 to young
parents who had not yet found their fortune.</TE>
<TE>   His father was a pre-law student at Lafayette College in Easton,
Pa., about to graduate $5,000 in debt and unable to afford law
school. His mother, a former model, was a stay-at-home mom who would
be pregnant again in months. With the elder Simon taking a temporary
job in advertising, the family scraped by on $35 a week and moved,
during Billy's second year, into a basement apartment in one of the
poorest tracts in Orange, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, however, Simon Sr. got into bond trading and, by the
time Billy was 4, they had moved again, into a three-bedroom home in
Florham Park, near Madison. They borrowed $2,000 for the down payment
and took a mortgage of $18,000--the last William Simon Sr. would ever
need.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Formative Years</TE>
<TE>   Florham Park was the raucous stage for nearly all of Billy Simon's
formative years. The home boiled with the hubbub of seven children
and their friends and all of the slapstick and tantrums of their
father's forceful personality. "There was always something going on
at our house," said sister Leigh Porges, seven years younger than
Billy. The children played hide-and-seek and kick the can. As they
got older, they gravitated toward touch football and tennis at courts
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother served dinner at 6 every night. The two boys regarded
their attic room as a clubhouse and kept the girls out. On Saturdays
in the fall, the family made the hour drive to Princeton to tailgate
at football games.</TE>
<TE>   Duty and devotion were two themes driven home nonstop. All the
kids had chores. Billy shined his father's shoes. He and Peter were
altar boys. They attended private Catholic school in the early grades
and were channeled -- there was no other choice -- to their father's
alma mater: Newark Academy, a strict all-boys prep school (later
co-ed) that sent a disproportionate share of young scholars to the
Ivy League.</TE>
<TE>   "They worked us like crazy," said Jay Hagenbuch, a Newark
classmate of Simon who remains a close friend and runs an investment
firm in San Francisco. Even at 14, a skinny kid who would never top
5-foot-10, Simon was clearly the type you'd want to buy shares in,
Hagenbuch said. "He had an awareness and a drive you could see. At
the same time, he was a very modest, sometimes quiet guy ... [with] a
warm and self-deprecating sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Simon, trailing his brother by two years, remembered "Billy
carrying around more books than I could ever carry." The single
expectation of both parents was that you'd try your best -- and
Billy, being the oldest, shouldered more of that pressure than
anyone. "He was a model at whatever he did," Peter said. "He was very
determined, very bright, very considerate of others, very
athletically inclined. ... Billy was always controlled. He rarely
overreacted to things -- rarely."</TE>
<TE>   His father's example was often the way not to behave. He could
demean and humiliate. Billy still remembers a day in his early teens
when friend John Faraci was visiting. For whatever reason, William
Simon flew into a rage and ordered both boys to their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten sent to my room before," recalled a laughing Faraci,
now a top executive at International Paper and still a close friend
of Simon. "But that was the first time somebody else's parents sent
me to my room."</TE>
<TE>   "Horrible" is how sister Mary Streep remembers some of their
father's tongue lashings. "It wore on you," she said. "We all seemed
able to cope with it because we all had each other to talk to." And
they learned, sometimes the hard way, to curb their own unruly
impulses.</TE>
<TE>   Billy's great love was tennis. "He played tennis every single day,
all day," Streep said. So it was a bitter lesson when his racket was
confiscated for a month after he threw it one day in anger. He begged
to have it back, Streep remembered, but their parents "were very,
very strict. [Billy] was in a lot of pain. It was probably the
greatest lesson he learned in his life."</TE>
<TE>   Family dynamics were complex. Carol was "gentle, dignified, like a
Princess Grace," said Streep. She tolerated a family of pranksters.
"We'd have food fights in the country club on Mother's Day," Streep
said. "For about seven years in a row, she got really mad at
somebody. Billy was one who would start throwing peas."</TE>
<TE>   Between the pranks and the outbursts, the noisy family dinners and
silent nights of study, one theme that emerged was a sense of life's
adventure. Nothing about the Simons was passive. They shared a zest
for life that instilled in Simon, the future gubernatorial candidate,
a feeling that anything was possible, anything could be tried.</TE>
<TE>   His father's example came across not only in his own formidable
achievements, but in the sheer energy he created. "Dad had his eyes
on the horizon: 'That's where we're going--follow me,' " said Simon,
who now tries to emulate that characteristic. Inspirational
quotations from the likes of Andrew Carnegie, or from particularly
trenchant works of literature, formed a ceaseless refrain. The
message was invariably one of perseverance, generosity or other noble
values.</TE>
<TE>   From "Scaramouche," the famous French Revolution tale of revenge,
came a line that Simon especially likes to recall: "He was born with
a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad."</TE>
<TE>   "[If] I'd lost a game, or something bad would happen ... he'd go
off with this line," Simon said. "There was an irreverence about our
household ... a sense that the world was mad, don't take yourself too
seriously. He had these themes. 'Beau Geste' was a favorite -- like
the French foreign legion. He had this sense ... there was nothing he
couldn't do if he put his mind to it."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude encouraged young Simon to broaden himself. Normally,
during the summers, he worked odd jobs -- cutting lawns, tending a
soda fountain, changing hospital sheets and beginning a lifelong
involvement in charity work. At 18, a student at Williams College in
Massachusetts with hopes of medical school, he was offered the chance
to volunteer at a hospital in remote Tanzania. His parents said
great, go do it, and he spent most of a summer there.</TE>
<TE>   Simon recalls taking a 24-hour bus trip into nowhere. A nurse met
him at the end of the one-street town and led him directly to
surgery. "This doctor with a mask on looks up at me and he says,
'Bill, look at this' and he reached into this lady's abdomen and
takes out her uterus like this -- " Simon lifted a hand above his
eyes. "And there's like these fibroids hanging down ... and I took
one look and I faint. The next thing I know I'm looking up at the
doctor. Turned out there was a miscommunication. What the doctor
thought he was getting was a senior intern, somebody who'd been all
the way through medical school. I'd just finished my freshman year in
college."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Change of Direction</TE>
<TE>   The Tanzania trip may have been an omen. He struggled in math and
science. Though he made the dean's list at Williams, his transcripts
are marred by C grades in chemistry, physics, calculus and cellular
metabolism, and even a D in principles of genetics. Eventually, Simon
changed his emphasis to German and Russian history.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was in college, his father's fortune was made, and
he was constructing a mansion on 64 acres in New Vernon, N.J. His
appointment as federal energy czar in 1973, during Simon's senior
year, moved the family into the political spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Simon recalls returning from the practice courts one day and being
confronted by his college roommates. Armed with the Wall Street
Journal, they shocked him with the raw numbers -- how much his father
had earned the previous year, and how those millions broke down per
diem. It was worth a big laugh, Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   "For all we knew, growing up, Dad was a banker," he remembered. No
one, it seemed, not even their mother, knew just how much wealth was
accumulating until the article came out. Simon called his father to
congratulate him. "All he said was, 'Shhhhh! I'm in big trouble with
your mother.' "</TE>
<TE>   As he grew, Simon's effort to be his own man developed in ways
both comic and serious. During a trip to the Middle East, the family
visited the Saudi Arabian oil minister. William Simon admonished his
children not to compliment any of the Saudi's possessions, Streep
said, because "in their culture, when you compliment something, they
feel obliged to give it to you. So we walk in ... and what's the
first thing Billy says? 'We love your camels.' Billy looks at me and
winks when he said it. It was so funny -- oh, God.</TE>
<TE>   "My father looked at Billy like, 'I'm going to kill you.' "</TE>
<TE>   The oil minister nearly shipped one of the animals to Washington,
D.C., Streep remembered. "It took [William Simon] a couple days," she
said, "to convince him we could not accept a camel."</TE>
<TE>   A far longer period of time would be necessary to bring about
meaningful equality between father and son, according to Streep.
Simon, armed with a law degree and Wall Street background, joined his
father's investment firm in 1988 and "was certainly intimidated, I'm
sure, many times in those beginning years," Streep said.</TE>
<TE>   He was ridden by his father. His judgment was questioned. He
endured all the blistering he could take, until one day, in the worst
sort of mood, he called his wife to vent about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Cindy said, 'Are you a man, or are you still a little boy?' "
Streep said, relating the story. "And that did it. He went back and
told his dad how he felt, and he didn't want to be talked to that way
any more."</TE>

<LD>There is little risk that potentially sickening sewage that oozed
into Malibu Creek State Park over the weekend will reach beaches and
the ocean, a water official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   After an underground pipe leaked Sunday morning in Calabasas, as
much as 2,000 gallons of sludge from homes in western Los Angeles
County and eastern Ventura County flowed into a culvert along Las
Virgenes Road and into creeks and parkland, said Norm Buehring,
director of resource conservation for Las Virgenes Municipal Water
District.</LD>
<LD>   The pipe carried sewage pumped from the district's Tapia Water
Reclamation Facility to its Rancho Las Virgenes plant, which
processes solid waste for composting. The leak occurred near Las
Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway.</LD>
<TE>   Crews shut off the pumps, vacuumed as much sludge as their
equipment could handle and dammed a portion of Malibu Creek to keep
the effluent from running toward the Pacific, Buehring said. Some of
the waste did flow over the makeshift dike, he said, but it will
probably seep into the ground and be filtered naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it goes underground, it will no longer be a health issue,"
Buehring said. "It will not get to the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   Test results measuring bacteria in the mile-long affected area
should be available today or Wednesday, and the broken pipe could be
fixed within the week, Buehring said.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the district is storing the sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District serves 85,000 customers
in Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, Oak Park
and portions of Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<HD>Strikes Shut Down Some UC Classes</HD>
<DH>Lecturers and clerical workers begin a two-day protest over
pay and job security. Riverside and Santa Cruz are hardest hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein and Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scores of classes at five University of California campuses were
canceled Monday as unionized lecturers and clerical workers began a
two-day strike to protest stalled contract talks and to highlight
their job complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The rare multi-campus walkout hit the Santa Cruz and Riverside
campuses hardest, but also led to scattered cancellations and service
disruptions at Irvine, Santa Barbara and Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The two unions' actions reflected an escalation in protests by the
lecturers and clerical workers, which struck briefly in late August
at UC Berkeley to call attention to concerns about contract
negotiations, job security and pay.</LD>
<TE>   Lecturers and other nontenured faculty members increasingly are
protesting what they see as their second-tier status at California's
four-year universities.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the strikes widened as some UC teaching assistants,
readers and tutors refused to cross picket lines.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Santa Cruz, a union official said that one-half to
three-quarters of classes had been called off. A UC Santa Cruz
spokeswoman, Elizabeth Irwin, could not give a specific figure but
said attendance had been "much reduced."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin said some of the classes may have been held off-campus by
faculty members who chose not to cross picket lines. She added that
local bus service had been disrupted by Teamster-represented drivers
who would not drive onto the campus. Likewise, most union
construction workers on UC Santa Cruz's five major construction
projects stayed away Monday.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Riverside, university spokesman Ricardo Duran said more than
100 classes had been called off. The cancellations were particularly
widespread in the English department, where about 80% of classes were
not held.</TE>
<TE>   At Irvine, where lecturers teach 22% of classes, the lecturers'
union said that as many as 25% of classes had been called off, but a
university official put the percentage at 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said they had not struck at UCLA or UC San Diego
because they need more time to organize their members there.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system and the striking unions, both of which are working
on expired contracts, have traded charges of bad faith bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the lecturers' union, the University Council-American
Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), say they are especially concerned
about job security. Lecturers are non-tenure-track, lower-paid
instructors who often work on one-term or one-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials have accused UC of a pattern of dropping lecturers
just before they reach six years of service, at which point they
would be entitled to three-year contracts. UC denies the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Lecturers also have long-running complaints about pay. According
to UC figures, tenured or tenure-track professors last year made an
average of $93,754, versus $45,519 for full-time and part-time
lecturers, some of whom have taught for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The lecturers' union disputes UC's pay figures, contending that
lecturers tend to earn from $37,000 to $42,000, depending on their
years of experience in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Clerical workers, represented by the Coalition of University
Employees, have focused on pay. They have asked for a 15% increase
over two years, and estimate that the average pay for their members
who work full time is about $27,000. UC officials have responded by
offering a 3.5% increase covering two years, saying they can't afford
to meet the union's demand.</TE>
<TE>   The clerical workers say they also want UC to take steps to curb
repetitive stress injuries caused by computer use.</TE>
<TE>   And they seek to curb UC's practice of keeping new hires on
temporary status to avoid giving them medical and retirement
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   On the UC Irvine campus Monday, Andrew Tonkovich, a composition
teacher and president of the UC-AFT local, mingled with students,
distributing fliers and exhorting onlookers to join the picket line.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole system operates on a mass exploitation of a class of
temporary employees called lecturers," Tonkovich said. "You get
people who are frustrated and feel vulnerable because they have no
guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine was the only one of the five campuses where clerical
workers did not join the strike, but some teaching assistants
participated by canceling their classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out here because that could be us someday," said Susanne
Hall, a graduate student in English who teaches a composition class.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Glen Mimura, who has taught in the Asian American
studies department for five years, was one of a few tenure-track
professors who joined the strike to support the lecturers, too.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who translate our research into meaningful
knowledge in the classroom," he said. "Those people in particular
deserve compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kristie Lopez, who has two Teamsters in her family, was
diplomatic as she contrasted Monday's protest with others she has
attended.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very civilized," said Lopez, 28. "But these are teachers,
not truck drivers."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who said none of her classes had been canceled, expressed
support for the lecturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It really diminishes the weight of all those degrees when they
can't even get job stability," she said.</TE>

<LD>Scores of classes at five University of California campuses were
canceled Monday as unionized lecturers and clerical workers began a
two-day strike to protest stalled contract talks and to highlight
their job complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The rare multi-campus walkout hit the Santa Cruz and Riverside
campuses hardest, but also led to scattered cancellations and service
disruptions at Irvine, Santa Barbara and Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The two unions' actions reflected an escalation in protests by the
lecturers and clerical workers, which struck briefly in late August
at UC Berkeley to call attention to concerns about contract
negotiations, job security and pay.</LD>
<TE>   Lecturers and other nontenured faculty members increasingly are
protesting what they see as their second-tier status at California's
four-year universities.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the strikes widened as some UC teaching assistants,
readers and tutors refused to cross picket lines.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Santa Cruz, a union official said that one-half to
three-quarters of classes had been called off. A UC Santa Cruz
spokeswoman, Elizabeth Irwin, could not give a specific figure but
said attendance had been "much reduced."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin said some of the classes may have been held off-campus by
faculty members who chose not to cross picket lines. She added that
local bus service had been disrupted by Teamster-represented drivers
who would not drive onto the campus. Likewise, most union
construction workers on UC Santa Cruz's five major construction
projects stayed away Monday.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Riverside, university spokesman Ricardo Duran said more than
100 classes had been called off. The cancellations were particularly
widespread in the English department, where about 80% of classes were
not held.</TE>
<TE>   At Irvine, where lecturers teach 22% of classes, the lecturers'
union said that as many as 25% of classes had been called off, but a
university official put the percentage at 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said they had not struck at UCLA or UC San Diego
because they need more time to organize their members there.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system and the striking unions, both of which are working
on expired contracts, have traded charges of bad faith bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the lecturers' union, the University Council-American
Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), say they are especially concerned
about job security. Lecturers are non-tenure-track, lower-paid
instructors who often work on one-term or one-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials have accused UC of a pattern of dropping lecturers
just before they reach six years of service, at which point they
would be entitled to three-year contracts. UC denies the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Lecturers also have long-running complaints about pay. According
to UC figures, tenured or tenure-track professors last year made an
average of $93,754, versus $45,519 for full-time and part-time
lecturers, some of whom have taught for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The lecturers' union disputes UC's pay figures, contending that
lecturers tend to earn from $37,000 to $42,000, depending on their
years of experience in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Clerical workers, represented by the Coalition of University
Employees, have focused on pay. They have asked for a 15% increase
over two years, and estimate that the average pay for their members
who work full time is about $27,000. UC officials have responded by
offering a 3.5% increase covering two years, saying they can't afford
to meet the union's demand.</TE>
<TE>   The clerical workers say they also want UC to take steps to curb
repetitive stress injuries caused by computer use.</TE>
<TE>   And they seek to curb UC's practice of keeping new hires on
temporary status to avoid giving them medical and retirement
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   On the UC Irvine campus Monday, Andrew Tonkovich, a composition
teacher and president of the UC-AFT local, mingled with students,
distributing fliers and exhorting onlookers to join the picket line.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole system operates on a mass exploitation of a class of
temporary employees called lecturers," Tonkovich said. "You get
people who are frustrated and feel vulnerable because they have no
guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine was the only one of the five campuses where clerical
workers did not join the strike, but some teaching assistants
participated by canceling their classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out here because that could be us someday," said Susanne
Hall, a graduate student in English who teaches a composition class.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Glen Mimura, who has taught in the Asian American
studies department for five years, was one of a few tenure-track
professors who joined the strike to support the lecturers, too.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the ones who translate our research into meaningful
knowledge in the classroom," he said. "Those people in particular
deserve compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kristie Lopez, who has two Teamsters in her family, was
diplomatic as she contrasted Monday's protest with others she has
attended.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very civilized," said Lopez, 28. "But these are teachers,
not truck drivers."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who said none of her classes had been canceled, expressed
support for the lecturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It really diminishes the weight of all those degrees when they
can't even get job stability," she said.</TE>

<HD>Truckers to Get Word of Child Abductions</HD>
<DH>Expansion of CHP's Amber alert system will help authorities
in searches late at night, say trucking and state officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Amber alert system will expand today to include notification to
truckers statewide of child abductions under a partnership between
the state and the California Trucking Assn., the lieutenant governor
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the California Highway Patrol, which issues Amber
Alerts, also will notify the truckers' organization, which will in
turn alert its 2,000 member companies. They then will contact their
drivers, a potential total of 38,000 truckers who can watch for
vehicles that might be carrying kidnapped children.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante said the partnership will particularly
help authorities in searches late at night, when most motorists on
California's highways are truck drivers.</LD>
<TE>   "Within one or two hours, everyone can be notified, so in those
precious moments in the late evening or early morning, what we're
basically doing is adding eyes and ears in order to keep our children
safe," Bustamante said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Hoemann, vice president of the Trucking Assn., said each
company will contact its drivers as they normally do, using CB
radios, cell phones or satellite phones.</TE>
<TE>   Since being established in California on July 31 of this year, the
Amber Alert system has helped authorities successfully rescue 18
kidnapping victims, Bustamante said.</TE>

<HD>Do Amber Alerts Put Drivers in Jeopardy?</HD>
<DH>Some say the signs create unsafe situations, but others say
the potential good is worth the risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic was moving smoothly a few weeks ago as David Rizzo, a
podiatrist from Fullerton, made his regular early-morning commute
along the Riverside Freeway to Norco. Suddenly, brake lights all
around him began to flash.</LD>
<LD>   An accident? A disabled car?</LD>
<LD>   No, the source of the congestion was an urgent message scrolling
on an electronic freeway sign overhead. The message--an Amber alert,
urging motorists to be on the lookout for the abductor of a kidnapped
child--forced motorists to slow down to read the glowing words
flashing overhead.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone suddenly started hitting their brakes," Rizzo said.
"Traffic never came to a complete stop but it caught everyone by
surprise."</TE>
<TE>   California motorists will need to get accustomed to this new
source of congestion. In July, the Golden State became the first in
the nation to use freeway message signs--along with radio, television
and the Internet--to disseminate the Amber alerts.</TE>
<TE>   The state has more than 1,000 portable and permanent freeway
signs, which were designed to warn motorists about freeway closings
and dangerous road conditions, such as ice or snow.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials and child safety advocates say the
traffic congestion is a small price to pay for potentially saving the
life of a kidnapped child.</TE>
<TE>   But it is clear that the system still has a few glitches. Using
the freeway signs also raises some questions about how and when they
should be used.</TE>
<TE>   For example, are the glowing messages a dangerous distraction to
the typical Southern California motorist who cruises at 65 mph while
sucking down a hot latte with one hand and dialing a cell phone with
the other?</TE>
<TE>   How much information can a driver remember before he is tempted to
reach into the glove box for a pen and paper?</TE>
<TE>   The use of the freeway signs in California prompted such concern
at the Federal Highway Administration that the agency issued a memo
in August, warning state agencies to use the changeable message signs
sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   The signs are not always "the most effective or safest method to
disseminate information related to child abductions," said the memo
from Jeffrey Paniati, an acting associate administrator at the
agency. They "can convey only a limited amount of information to
motorists."</TE>
<TE>   The memo instructs law enforcement officials to establish a policy
for shutting off the flashing freeway messages if they "create an
adverse traffic impact, such as queues, markedly slowing traffic,
etc."</TE>
<TE>   Since the signs were introduced in Southern California in the late
1960s, transportation officials and police have used them to pass on
a variety of warnings, tips and travel information. Some attempts
have been successful. Others have not.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick, agrees that freeway message
signs should be used judiciously. But he said he would be willing to
sacrifice a smooth commute to improve the chances of rescuing a
kidnapped child.</TE>
<TE>   "The consensus here is that the decision to save a child's life"
takes precedence, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway message signs were credited with the rescue last month
of a 9-year-old girl kidnapped by her mentally disturbed mother in
Kern County. Two men, including an off-duty corrections officer, saw
an Amber alert on a freeway sign near Chula Vista and spotted the car
that matched the description on the sign.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Bay Area, where the same alert was displayed above
several busy freeways, a few of the signs were partly unreadable. On
one sign, the last two digits of a police phone number were missing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that these signs work," said Joann Donnellan, a
spokeswoman for the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children. "But this is brand new. There are going to be some
glitches."</TE>
<TE>   The Amber alert has had problems in Southern California too.</TE>
<TE>   An alert was issued about two weeks ago to locate Amadeo Medina
Jr., who allegedly abducted his 1-year-old son and his wife's sister
from Los Angeles and was headed for the Mexican border. But on the
second day of the alert, CHP dispatchers in Los Angeles were
inundated with angry calls from motorists complaining about the
traffic problems caused by the alerts.</TE>
<TE>   The Medina alert flashed two messages in sequence. The first said
"Child Abduction" and the second gave Medina's license plate number
and a description of his truck. Other alerts have extended to three
messages.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the complaints, local CHP officials discontinued
the freeway messages during the morning rush hours in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to create another dangerous situation while
reacting to the first," a CHP spokesman, Tom Marshall, said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   Later that same day, police located Medina and his alleged victims
by tracing his cellular phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   But even in the Medina case, Helmick said, he would have kept the
freeway alerts on, despite the traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   By their very design, freeway message signs distract motorists, if
only briefly. But some critics fear that such a distraction could
became a life-threatening freeway hazard.</TE>
<TE>   A 2001 study by the University of North Carolina found that
objects and events outside the car were the leading causes of
distraction-related accidents, far surpassing cell phones, smoking
and radios.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Severson, who regularly commutes from Rowland Heights to El
Segundo, said he was recently caught in a traffic jam caused by an
Amber alert.</TE>
<TE>   "It is only a matter of time before any possible benefit to these
practices is offset by increased property damage and possible loss of
life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Donnellan said law enforcement officials and child safety experts
suggest that the potential for distraction could be reduced if
freeway signs simply urged motorists to turn on their radios for
details about a child abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "We do need to be concerned that we aren't causing traffic jams,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Amber alerts are only the latest attempt to use the signs for
something other than traffic warnings.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1984 Olympics in L.A., they were used successfully to
provide traffic information and directions to athletic events.</TE>
<TE>   But the signs did not work so well in the 1970s, when state
transportation officials used them to encourage motorists to ride
together. One read "Take the train." Another said "Don't Be Fuelish,
be Car-Poolish."</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of reaction to that," said Chuck O'Connell, a former
administrator for the California Department of Transportation. "We
got some angry reaction. The calls came in in buckets."</TE>

<DL>RUNNELLS, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Standing against a setting sun, Stan Thompson suffers all the usual
indignities of a first-time candidate challenging a member of the
U.S. House.</LD>
<LD>   Many waiting in line for a recent Southeast Polk High School
football game here mistake him for one of the ticket-takers and try
to hand him their stubs. Most don't know whether he's a Democrat (no)
or a Republican (yes).</LD>
<LD>   For Thompson, the silver lining on this cloudless autumn evening
is that his opponent, Democratic Rep. Leonard L. Boswell, is as much
a blank slate for most of those at the game. Though Boswell has
served three terms, the state's unique system for redrawing
congressional seats wiped out his mostly rural southern Iowa district
and forced him to move into a new district centered on urban Des
Moines and suburbs such as this.</LD>
<TE>   And that, as much as anything else, has made Thompson's challenge
a competitive race in a year when competitive House races appear on
the verge of extinction. Nor is Boswell the only incumbent facing a
serious challenge in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of the state's nonpartisan system for drawing
congressional boundaries, either party has a genuine chance to win
three of Iowa's House races this year -- with a fourth contest,
though tilting toward the GOP, still having the potential for an
upset.</TE>
<TE>   That means Iowa, with five congressional districts, has more
competitive races than California (one), Illinois (one) and New York
(none), who have a combined 103 districts. Nationwide, operatives in
both parties say that, absent some late developments, the outcome may
be truly in doubt in as few as two dozen of the 435 House races.</TE>
<TE>   This collapse of competition has been driven largely by the
states' practice of drawing congressional districts that provide a
lopsided advantage to one party or the other. That trend worries
observers from all points on the political spectrum, who argue that
it is denying most Americans the right to cast a meaningful ballot
for the House.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real assault against democracy," said Steve Moore,
president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political group. "It
is basically disenfranchising huge portions of voters."</TE>
<TE>   It's probably not a coincidence that Iowa, the state where
competition for the House is thriving this year, is also the state
that has gone the furthest to take redistricting away from
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Iowa is 100% unique," said Tim Storey, a redistricting expert at
the National Conference of State Legislatures. "If there is such an
ideal as taking politics out of redistricting ... then Iowa moves
closer to that ideal than any other state."</TE>
<TE>   Every 10 years, states redraw their lines for House and state
legislative districts to reflect population changes recorded in the
U.S. census. In 43 states, including California, the lines are drawn
by state legislators and approved by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Six other states draw their district lines with the help of
independent commissions, though Storey notes that these are not
entirely insulated from politics because the members typically have
ties to the two major political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the parties this year opted less to try to squeeze out
new gains in congressional redistricting than to solidify the seats
they already held. The result was a series of new maps that made
districts more favorable for incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   California is a typical case, where the only race among 53 House
districts that analysts view as competitive is the one between
Democrat Dennis Cardoza and Republican Dick Monteith in the Central
Valley. They are battling for the seat held by Rep. Gary A. Condit of
Ceres, who lost in the primary. "You had state legislators decide
they would rather protect their clout in Washington [by solidifying
incumbents]," said Amy Walter, who tracks House races for the
nonpartisan Cook Political Report.</TE>
<TE>   More security for incumbents has translated into less competition
for voters.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa's redistricting system, though, minimizes the influence of
incumbents -- and the political parties -- on the process. Under its
approach -- adopted in the 1970s after the state Supreme Court threw
out a redistricting map drawn by the state Legislature -- the
district lines are drawn by the nonpartisan Legislative Service
Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   In drawing the maps, the law requires the bureau to avoid
splitting counties, to keep the districts compact and to ensure they
have equal population. Most important, it bars the bureau from
considering any political information about the districts: voting
history, partisan balance or where incumbents live.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no political information when we do it. All we look at is
total population," said Ed Cook, a senior counsel at the bureau who
directed the process. Under Iowa law, the Legislature must vote up or
down, without amendment, on the bureau's plan. It rejected the first
proposal last year, but accepted the second -- and immediately set
off a shuffle among House incumbents. Boswell and 13-term Republican
Rep. James A. Leach were forced to move when their homes were
swallowed into new districts.</TE>
<TE>   When the dust cleared, only the 5th Congressional District in the
heavily Republican western part of the state was considered entirely
safe for one party. In the new 4th District, competitive on paper,
Republican Rep. Tom Latham has established a clear advantage over
John Norris, a former Democratic state party chairman.</TE>
<TE>   But the other three races are all highly competitive. Boswell
leads Thompson in the latest Democratic polling, but both sides
consider the race within reach. In the new 1st District, Republican
Rep. Jim Nussle, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is facing a
formidable challenge from Ann Hutchinson, the mayor of Bettendorf.
And Leach, now running in the new 2nd district, is getting all he can
handle from Democrat Julie Thomas, a pediatrician.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbents still have important advantages in the Iowa races.
Except for Leach, who doesn't accept financial contributions from
political action committees or donors outside the state, the
incumbents all have raised more than their challengers. And no issue
is generating a broad demand for change; the candidates are slugging
it out over Social Security, prescription drug costs, health care and
taxes--issues that haven't produced a decisive advantage for either
side around the country.</TE>
<TE>   But the Iowa incumbents are being pressed harder than their
colleagues almost anywhere else, largely because the redistricting is
forcing them to court so many new voters. The change is greatest for
Boswell: three-fourths of the voters in his new district weren't in
his old one.</TE>
<TE>   But Nussle and Leach are running in districts where almost 40% of
voters are new to them. That creates opportunities for challengers
unavailable in districts where almost all voters have settled
impressions of an incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the new territory that makes these districts so problematic
for the incumbents," said Mark Gersh, a top Democratic strategist on
House races.</TE>
<TE>   Helping Boswell is that he typically bought ads on Des Moines
television stations during his races in his old district. Early polls
for Thompson's campaign found that about 80% of voters in the new
district recognized Boswell's name.</TE>
<TE>   But at the Southeast Polk football game, it was clear that the
recognition didn't go much further than that with voters such as Ted
Eddleman, a Runnells postal worker.</TE>
<TE>   "Your hear his name on the news," said Eddleman, who struggled for
a moment when asked what else he associated with Boswell, before
adding: "He's a farmer."</TE>
<TE>   That rural imagery was an asset for Boswell in his old district;
it's a mixed blessing in this heavily suburban area.</TE>
<TE>   That subtle cultural contrast is just another way that Iowa's
redistricting approach exposes its House members to electoral
pressures that have become distant memories for most of their
colleagues in other states.</TE>

<HD>Perle's Passion Is Served</HD>
<DH>The unflinching hawk with a flair for gourmet cooking is
known for dishing up blunt talk on Iraq that has often become U.S.
policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A huge video screen hung from the ceiling, behind the ornate mahogany
desks and oil portraits of elders that give the House International
Relations Committee room an air of history.</LD>
<LD>   Peering down from the screen, three times the size of anyone else
in the room, was the committee's next witness, live from the U.S.
Embassy in London. Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), no small figure
himself, looked up at the screen and observed, "Richard Perle is
hovering over us."</LD>
<LD>   When he was assistant secretary of Defense in the Reagan
administration, adversaries called him the Prince of Darkness for his
fierce resistance to arms control treaties with the Soviets. Today,
Perle is often described as the Bush administration's leading hawk on
Iraq. As chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a panel of leading
Republican foreign policy thinkers who advise the secretary of
Defense, his sway inside government circles is considerable. He
speaks to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld regularly. Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz is a friend.</LD>
<TE>   But it is his role outside the government -- from his perch at the
American Enterprise Institute -- that affords Perle the luxury of
moral outrage. While liberals look for accommodation with European
allies before taking action against Iraq, Perle offers that it would
be nice if antiwar German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder would resign.</TE>
<TE>   When some military experts urge time for weapon inspections to
work, Perle charges appeasement, invoking the specter of Britain's
Neville Chamberlain underestimating the menace of Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   Few of Perle's ideological allies go so far in their
outspokenness. But Perle's pronouncements on Iraq have made him a hot
media draw -- the Arabic news network Al Jazeera calls regularly, as
do newspapers from Tokyo to Toronto and every alphabet news channel
on the satellite spectrum. Like a test marketer for the most
doctrinaire ideas, Perle keeps lobbing his verbal arrows into media
cyberspace. Some in the administration think his outbursts are a
distraction. But many of his pronouncements on Iraq have echoed in
subsequent Bush administration positions. For weeks, Perle has been
arguing that eliminating Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction
is "indistinguishable" from ending Saddam Hussein's rule. He has been
warning Iraqi generals that they could face war crime trials if they
carry out Hussein's orders to use biological or chemical weapons.
President Bush made use of both points in his nationwide address last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Perle's influence is indirect. He does not talk to White House
speech writers.</TE>
<TE>   The last time he briefed Bush one-on-one was during the campaign,
when he lobbied for NATO enlargement. For critics of administration
policy, however, Perle's influence is unnerving.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumsfeld, [Vice President Dick] Cheney, Wolfowitz -- these are
new conservatives, hawks, rational hard-liners," said one Arab
diplomat who asked not to be quoted by name. "Then you have Perle,
who is blindly obsessive. It's almost neo-imperialistic."</TE>
<TE>   Perle's view of foreign policy is contained in an ideological
odyssey from a culture of liberalism in Southern California to one of
conservatism in Washington. His course was steered by two mentors --
one an erudite academic, the other a Democratic senator -- who drew a
generation of conservatives to the belief that great powers survive
only if they exercise military might.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Culinary Fantasy</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the policy debate, Perle is an original -- a conservative
agitator with a passion for the good life, a member of the Washington
establishment who defies the town's workaholic habits, a weapon
strategist who at the height of the Cold War fantasized about opening
a souffle restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that Perle, 61, now enjoys his role as the
enfant terrible of the neoconservatives, defined by their hawkish
views on foreign policy and their free-market ideas on economic
issues. Bemused by Hyde's comment that he is hovering over the debate
on Iraq, Perle says later, "I should have thrown thunderbolts too."</TE>
<TE>   But he is careful not to overstate his role. "I've been in
Washington for many years, and you end up knowing pretty much
everyone," he said over a lunch of sashimi (gourmet tastes have added
pounds and put him on a low-carbohydrate diet), at a favorite
Japanese restaurant. "So if you have an idea, you can get it out much
more quickly. That's what it means to have influence in Washington.
In the end, it's the quality of the idea that matters, not that it
came from me."</TE>
<TE>   The contest for ideas has defined Richard N. Perle almost from the
beginning, or at least as far back as Hollywood High School, circa
1959.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perle was not a child of privilege. After World War II, his father
moved the family from New York to Los Angeles, where he worked in the
wholesale drapery business.</TE>
<TE>   His parents worked hard to send him to private school. But he was
frequently late to class, and often got into arguments with
exasperated teachers. When he was elected president of the junior
class, the school asked his parents to send him elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   So he ended up at Hollywood High. The general atmosphere of
just-good-enough forced those of ambition and intellect to band
together, clinging to the instruction of a few good teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The climate was post-McCarthyism, but still Cold War. He co-edited
the campus poetry magazine with a student whose father, an attorney,
represented one of the Hollywood Ten, the writers blackballed by
accusations that they were communist sympathizers. On the debate
team, he argued with kids whose parents had been hauled before the
House Un-American Activities Committee. He still calls them
"commies."</TE>
<TE>   "The commies troubled me from the beginning," he says. "I would
visit them in their homes; they were quite affluent. It's what the
French call 'gauche caviar.' The hypocrisy bothered me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   He befriended a classmate named Joan Wohlstetter, who invited him
to her home in the Hollywood Hills. There, he was smitten -- with her
father's intellect.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Wohlstetter is an icon to many conservative thinkers. An
elegant worldly man who enjoyed fine cuisine, he researched at the
Rand Corp. and taught at the University of Chicago, molding
neoconservative thought.</TE>
<TE>   A logician by training, he applied the rigors of math to military
planning, turning U.S. nuclear strategy on its head. In "The Delicate
Balance of Terror," Wohlstetter challenged the prevailing assumption
that neither superpower would dare to use nuclear weapons. Technology
made nuclear war winnable, he argued, and deterrence questionable.
"He started talking about those issues," Perle recalled. "It was
fascinating."</TE>
<TE>   At USC, Perle took a class on international relations from Ross
Berkes, who cited Hans Morgenthau, a political scientist who argued
that militarily strong nations survive, while weak ones do not. Until
then Perle had been a humanities major, his dream to teach English at
some Midwest college. Now he began to study the world.</TE>
<TE>   It was not far from there to the London School of Economics, where
Edward N. Luttwak, now at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, recalls Perle defending President Kennedy's bold embargo of
Soviet missiles in Cuba in a university debate, almost
single-handedly turning anti-American audience opinion. Or from there
to Princeton University, where Perle received a master's degree in
international studies. Or from there to Washington, where Wohlstetter
called him to come muster the case for a ballistic missile defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Will Recalls Perle</TE>
<TE>   George Will, the conservative commentator, knew Perle at
Princeton, and in Washington, when Perle worked for Sen. Henry
"Scoop" Jackson (D-Wash.) and Will was press secretary to Sen. Gordon
Allott (R-Colo.). He remembers Perle as a sweet person -- a fan of T.
S. Eliot. "He is not a fierce combatant," Will said. "He just has
convictions and information and a worldview."</TE>
<TE>   Perle's worldview gained muscle under the tutelage of Jackson and
his chief foreign policy aide -- Dorothy Fosdick, daughter of the
famous pacifist the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick and one of the first
women in American diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had gathered a brain trust that included Perle, Wolfowitz,
Frank Gaffney, currently head of the Washington-based Center for
Security Policy, and Charles Horner, now at the Hudson Institute.
"There was a rich intellectual and philosophical tradition there,"
Horner recalled. Heated political debates were not uncommon in "the
bunker," Room 135 of what is now the Russell Senate Office Building.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson treated his staff, and particularly Perle -- whose father
died shortly after he went to Washington -- as his own children. To
this day, Perle says he is a registered Democrat, out of respect for
Jackson, who died in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, Jackson indulged his staff's brainstorming sessions,
matching their quest for ideas with his own. Jackson would hold
congressional hearings with then-unknown speakers such as Middle East
expert Bernard Lewis, defense analyst James Schlesinger and
Kremlinologist Leopold Labedz to talk about the world as they saw it.
"Scoop thought ideas mattered, even if there was no immediate
legislative issue," Perle said.</TE>
<TE>   In Jackson's view, the only antidote to political dictatorship was
military might. And the only way to win liberal votes for hawkish
foreign policy positions, he believed, was to link their issues to
yours. When the Soviet Union slammed the door on emigration,
Jackson's answer was simple: no freedom, no commerce. Liberals, who
worried that cutting off trade would only hurt the Soviet people,
were in no position to oppose free immigration of dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   It was a ploy Perle adopted in 1981, when, at the height of arms
control fever, he proposed the famous "zero option." Faced with
European protests over Reagan administration plans to put
medium-range missiles in Germany, Perle in one stroke quieted the
protesters and the Soviets by suggesting that both superpowers lower
their arsenals to zero. Many suspected that Perle was merely trying
to kill off arms control pacts altogether, but they were loath to
oppose the idea of eliminating a whole class of weapons. The result,
as Perle and the Reagan administration knew, was to shift public
opinion in Europe to the American argument that as long as the
Soviets had medium-range weapons pointed at Europe, the allies had to
have some pointing back.</TE>
<TE>   "Zero option came right out of Scoop Jackson's playbook," said Bob
Kaufman, a professor of international relations at the University of
Vermont and author of Jackson's biography. "Richard Perle had Scoop
in his bones."</TE>
<TE>   Perle has been on the warpath against Saddam Hussein since 1987,
when he criticized the U.S. government for tilting toward Iraq in the
Iran-Iraq War, arguing that Hussein was more of a threat than the
ayatollahs. Four years ago he began questioning the U.S. edict
against assassinating foreign leaders. Now he advocates elimination
of Hussein, and offers no zone for compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Disarming Iraq without regime change is impossible in his view.
"You simply cannot leave him in control of that territory and expect
that you will get real disarmament," he said Oct. 6 on NBC's "Meet
the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Many Arab diplomats are still smarting that Perle invited an
anti-Saudi speaker to brief the Defense Policy Board. They think
Perle personally turned President Bush's mind to war with Iraq, and
suspect him of being an Israeli agent. Perle dismisses the charge,
noting that he has argued with Israelis for years about the risks of
taking out Hussein. Perle is Jewish, but was not attuned to Israel's
needs until Jackson took him to Saudi Arabia in 1970, where Perle
pulled an all-nighter debating officials who accused him of writing
Zionist speeches while he questioned their financing of Palestinian
causes.</TE>
<TE>   When Perle seeks brief refuge from the public policy battles, he
can be found at home, in a kitchen any great chef would envy. Unlike
the wars over arms control or Middle East policy, the gratification
from a meal beautifully prepared is instantaneous. So attracted is
Perle to the mechanics of cooking that he obsessed for years about
opening a souffle restaurant in which a conveyor belt would bring a
glass-enclosed oven to the table and patrons could watch their meals
rise.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think it's a good idea," he said, between bites of raw
fish.</TE>
<TE>   With his marriage in its 25th year, a son he adores, a house in
France purchased with friends in 1982 as "a shrewd investment" and a
friendly dog named Reagan, Perle has few regrets in life, although
there are some. He supports his brother, who was born brain-damaged,
in California, and it tugs at his heart.</TE>
<TE>   He has a few policy regrets -- Egypt's Anwar Sadat proved a
greater leader than envisioned; he thinks President Ford's Helsinki
accord, with its emphasis on human rights, helped topple the Soviet
Union despite conservative criticism.</TE>
<TE>   He has no second thoughts about leaving the academic track, aware
perhaps that his talents for tactical warfare might have been wasted
there. Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who admits he
was outmaneuvered by Perle on a few occasions, calls him "one of the
few creative people around."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent hearing at the House Armed Services Committee,
Rep. Jim Saxton (R-N.J.) apologized. "I keep wanting to call you Dr.
Perle," he told the witness.</TE>
<TE>   Perle hesitated, perhaps remembering the uncompleted doctoral
thesis he left at Princeton on international negotiating styles. He
had opted instead to put his theories to practice in Washington. He
had chosen the life of influence. "I never finished my dissertation,"
he told the congressman, smiling.</TE>

<HD>Another Victim of a Single Bullet</HD>
<DH>Police in Virginia swarm a parking lot where a woman is
killed. Sniper may have struck again.</DH>

<DL>FALLS CHURCH, Va.</DL>
<LD>A woman was shot dead with a single bullet to the head outside a
suburban shopping center Monday night, and investigators were
scrambling to figure out whether this was the latest in a string of
sniper slayings that have terrorized Washington's suburbs this month.</LD>
<LD>   The killing shattered a jittery peace that had settled over the
nation's capital over the long weekend. Ten people were shot -- eight
of them fatally -- in the 12 days prior to Monday by the anonymous
sniper.</LD>
<LD>   As in most of those shootings, the marksmanship was flawless
Monday night. "One shot," said shopper Raymond Massas, "not very
loud, like a snap. After that I heard people start panicking."</LD>
<TE>   After the shot sounded about 9:15 p.m., the gunman seemed to
dissolve into this dark landscape of highway and chain stores. The
woman had emerged from Home Depot, and was shot as she loaded
packages into her trunk, with her husband nearby. She was not
immediately identified.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the question in everyone's mind is, 'Is this shooting
related to the others that we've had in the area?' " Fairfax County
Police Chief Tom Manger said. "It's too early to tell. However, we
are working it and investigating it with that potential in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Police were hunting for a cream-colored Chevrolet Astro van with a
silver ladder rack on the top and the left tail light burned out,
Manger told reporters. The van was last seen headed east on Route 50
from Falls Church, which is about 10 miles west of Washington.
Interstates 66 and 495, two major highways that could offer quick
getaways, are nearby. Traffic throughout the region was brought to a
standstill for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives were also interviewing several witnesses. Agents from
the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms joined
Fairfax County police in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Seven Corners shopping center rises at a crossroads of several
heavily traveled highways, echoing previous attacks in which the
sniper struck near busy roadways offering fluid escape. Witnesses
said they spotted a light-colored van near the shopping center
Monday. A white van or truck has been the only clue police have
released in connection with the serial sniper.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday's shooting, authorities set up check points on
numerous roads. Traffic ground to a halt, and brilliant snakes of car
lights stood paralyzed in all directions past midnight. Helicopters
beat overhead. A group of investigators jogged west alongside Route
50 with a bloodhound that sniffed the road.</TE>
<TE>   Federal, state and local investigators teemed over the shopping
center, and spread to the wide parking lot of an adult education
center across Route 50. The school is on an uphill rise, and could
offer a clean shot.</TE>
<TE>   "We are saturating this area as well as the main routes," Manger
said. "We have as many police officers as we can get in this area."</TE>
<TE>   The woman was shot in the head as she and her husband loaded
packages, said Ellen Qualls, a spokeswoman for Virginia Gov. Mark R.
Warner. Someone fired the fatal shot from a van, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser Ahmed, 52, had just finished picking out a new faucet for
his sink and was strolling toward the parking area when a woman
hurtled toward him. "Oh my God," she cried. "A woman has just been
shot." Thirty feet away, Ahmed saw the victim's slumped body
alongside a parked car.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone yelled, 'Go inside, go inside,' Everyone was screaming,"
Ahmed said. The shoppers dashed back into the store, where about 30
people were held. Pandemonium prevailed in the hardware store. People
wept.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shaking," Ahmed said. "If I had walked out two or three
minutes before it could have been me."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the shootings -- one of which injured a woman in
Fredericksburg, Va. -- occurred outside Michaels craft stores, and
there is a Michaels in the Seven Corners center. Earlier Monday, a
company spokesman said there is an "ongoing communication between us
and the police."</TE>
<TE>   "Our main focus is assisting the police," said Tom Clary. "They've
asked us not comment on the scope of their investigation."</TE>
<TE>   These are affluent suburbs, home to legions of white-collar
workers who pour over the Beltway at dusk -- in part to escape the
urban dangers presumed to belong to the inner city.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's crazy," said Kevin Neuenschwander, a 21-year-old
shopper whose car was trapped inside the parking structure when squad
cars and uniformed officers descended out of the darkness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's happening so close to home," said his companion, a
22-year-old woman who gave her name only as Tiffany. "I'm scared
mostly for my younger brothers and sisters. I haven't gotten gas for
my car since this whole thing began. I'm running on empty now."</TE>
<TE>   Their dismay was echoed by President Bush, who earlier Monday said
the "cold-blooded" attacks have made him sick to his stomach. "I weep
for those who have lost their loved ones," he said. "The idea of moms
taking their kids to school and sheltering them from a potential
sniper is not the America I know."</TE>
<TE>   Men and women of all ages, ethnicities and socioeconomic
backgrounds have been gunned down in everyday settings -- gas
stations, shopping centers and a middle school. With a mysterious
gunman making a killing field of the suburbs, fear is general.</TE>
<TE>   "He is destroying our daily lives," said Nico Casillas, 32, of
Falls Church. "How can you stop going to Home Depot? It dumbfounds
me. If I stop going to this Home Depot, who's to say he won't be at
the next Home Depot?"</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Picked On the Wrong Giant Guy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For some reason the St. Louis Cardinals felt the need to punish Kenny
Lofton. That turned out to have all the impact of sending a kid to
his room -- where he has a TV, PlayStation and a mini-fridge.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis pitcher Matt Morris hit Lofton with a pitch in the third
inning. Lofton spent the rest of the game hitting back. He came
through with three hits, the last of which drove in the winning run
in the bottom of a ninth for the 2-1 victory that sent the San
Francisco Giants to the World Series against the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   This all dated to the first game, when Lofton struck a pose after
hitting a home run off Morris in the Giants' 9-6 victory. Reliever
Mike Crudale threw at Lofton in his next at-bat, and when Lofton took
exception both benches emptied.</LD>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals couldn't let it go. They got caught up in
this defend-the-honor of the game stuff. That's what happens with a
manager like Tony La Russa, who doesn't always abide by the rulebook
because he believes he should be the author of the next edition. La
Russa set the tone for this when he couldn't stop talking about
Lofton the day after the original incident.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if they spent so much time swallowing their pride and
trying to keep their egos in check by walking Barry Bonds every
chance they got that they had to reassert themselves somehow.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of getting over Lofton they carried him with them all
the way to Game 5, their last gasp of the season. Morris, wanting his
own payback, nailed Lofton when the Giants' centerfielder led off the
fourth inning. It was pretty obvious what was going on. Morris shook
off Mike Matheny's call for a fastball away, shook off the curveball
and nodded on a fastball inside. Then he threw it way inside,
drilling Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   There was no score, Morris had a perfect game going and he creates
a baserunner and increases his chances of facing Bonds just to prove
a point?</TE>
<TE>   Pointless.</TE>
<TE>   Did someone forget to tell them the World Series was at stake
here? Couldn't payback wait until next year. All Morris' pitch
achieved was to motivate Lofton and the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have a hit since that Game 1 home run and was two for 18
in the series at before the beaning.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they say, let a sleeping dog lie," Lofton said.</TE>
<TE>   The wide-awake Lofton finished three for four with a run and the
game-winning RBI.</TE>
<TE>   "What Kenny did tonight was phenomenal," Bonds said. "They hit him
on purpose. Everyone knew what happened. We told Kenny just keep his
composure, stay focused, don't allow that to affect you or take you
out of your game. That's a class act on Kenny's part and he beat 'em.
And he deserves to beat 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Lofton finally started barking like a leadoff hitter. He singled
to start the sixth, then moved to second when Morris hit Rich
Aurilia. They were one batter away from sending Bonds to the plate
with a chance to swing the bat, but Jeff Kent snuffed the rally when
he grounded to third baseman Miguel Cairo, who stepped on the bag to
force Lofton, then threw across the diamond to get Kent at first.
With first base open, Morris intentionally walked Bonds, then got
Benito Santiago to ground out to third.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton gave the Cardinals a break in the field when he mishandled
a drive to right-center by Mike Matheny. It bounced off Lofton's
glove, but was ruled a hit, leading to St. Louis' only run. Lofton
got it back in the bottom of the eighth. His one-out single started a
rally that resulted in a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Bonds that
brought Lofton home and tied the score.</TE>
<TE>   That brought on the real drama in the ninth. Morris had pitched a
terrific game, but he allowed consecutive hits to David Bell and
Shawon Dunston. La Russa pulled him out and sent in Steve Kline, the
only pitcher in the majors with a dirtier hat than Eric Gagne. And
Kline also has some nasty stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker thought about pinch-hitting for Lofton.
Then he told himself, "No, don't be crazy, let Kenny win this game."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lofton: "I just told myself, swing at a good pitch."</TE>
<TE>   He liked the first pitch he saw, a slider that he sent to right
field as Bell raced home with the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   On to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Anaheim. Orange County. The 714 area code. Giant fans are
going to need a quick reminder. Some started chanting "Beat L.A." No
matter how many fans north of the border have hopped on the
bandwagon, Anaheim represents L.A. as much as Oakland represents San
Francisco. San Franciscans, please think about that as you eat your
clam chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl at the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, California will be a winner. That makes two in-state
championship series this year (We all know Lakers vs. Sacramento
Kings was the real NBA Finals.)</TE>
<TE>   The travel plans are finalized because Lofton, who was acquired by
the Giants in a July trade, finally came through.</TE>
<TE>   "People said I was oh-for-whatever, but I was swinging the bat,"
Lofton said. "You can't make the ball fall for a hit. Just hit it
hard. That's what I was doing, but it just didn't fall. In the end,
they're going to pay off. And it did."</TE>
<TE>   He hit .267 and stole seven bases after he arrived, but the Giants
kept waiting for him to do his thing in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton, who was with the Cleveland Indians when they lost to the
Atlanta Braves in 1995, is one of only five Giants to have played in
the World Series. Said Baker: "I just knew Kenny was focused and you
can't keep Kenny down too long."</TE>
<TE>   He did, even if he picked up a bruise along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh well," Lofton said. "It doesn't hurt right now."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>No Time Off for Hudler's Vocal Cords</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Angel players rested Monday, one day after securing the first
World Series invitation in franchise history and five days before the
Series begins at Edison Field, one man spoke on their behalf.</LD>
<LD>   For several weeks now, Rex Hudler has spoken on their behalf. Now,
with the Angels and San Francisco Giants set for the World Series,
the Angels' loquacious broadcaster isn't about to shut up any time
soon.</LD>
<LD>   Hudler, who played on the 1995 Angel team that coughed up an
11-game lead, makes no apologies for rooting for the home team. He's
the one who coined the nickname "X Factor" for shortstop/catalyst
David Eckstein, and fans at Edison Field now cross their big red
Thunder Stix into a big X each time Eckstein comes to bat.</LD>
<TE>   Since the playoffs started, Hudler said, he has averaged seven
radio appearances per day, from a small FM station in Orange County
to a booming sports-talk station in Philadelphia. If he has to get up
at 6 a.m. to preach the gospel of the Angels to an East Coast
audience, he said, so be it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a salesman," Hudler said, "and this team is a salesman's
delight."</TE>
<TE>   Hudler thanked his wife, Jennifer, for her understanding during
this window of time when the rest of the country is suddenly
interested in the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for this fine product," Hudler said, "I'd be
changing diapers full-time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are sold out for World Series games at Edison Field, but
the San Francisco Giants are selling tickets at 10 a.m. Wednesday for
World Series games at Pacific Bell Park. The Giants play host to the
Angels for Games 3, 4 and 5 Oct. 22-24.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants will sell half the tickets at Pacific Bell Park. The
other half will be sold online at sfgiants.com and via phone at (510)
762-2277.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus went to the playoffs last season -- not
as a participant, but as a guest of former teammate Jim Edmonds, who
invited him to one of the Cardinals' playoff games at Busch Stadium.
The St. Louis baseball fans are renowned as the best in America, but
Glaus said the atmospheres at Busch Stadium last October and Edison
Field this October are "very comparable."</TE>
<TE>   To the Angels' red sea of fans, Glaus tipped his cap.</TE>
<TE>   "They're loud, they've got those banging things, and they're into
it," Glaus said. "It's great to have that much energy in the
ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hitting four home runs in the postseason, Glaus has
coined a word. In describing the thrill of playoff intensity, Glaus
said Saturday that "every at-bat, every play, every possible thing
that could happen could be monstra-mental in the outcome of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Said coach Joe Maddon: "I like that word, an accumulation of all
the big things that can happen. I think it's something he picked up
at UCLA, and he's been holding back for the appropriate moment to cut
it loose."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The craziest thing about that 10-run seventh inning Sunday that
sent the Angels into the World Series? Chone Figgins and Alex Ochoa
entered the game as pinch-runners, and each got to bat during an
inning in which 15 men came to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Figgins, on the playoff roster as a pinch-runner, singled. He had
not batted previously in the playoffs and is not likely to do so
again, so he could finish with a 1.000 postseason average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey and Francisco Rodriguez are the first American League
rookie teammates to earn postseason victories since Wilcy Moore and
George Pipgras of the 1927 New York Yankees. That team, often labeled
as the best in baseball history, featured Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth in
a lineup that gave birth to the nickname "Murderers' Row."</TE>

<DH>The Angels' bandwagon is groaning under weight of new
arrivals, but no one is being turned away</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>You know who you are. You nod when you hear the words "rally monkey,"
but you have no idea what a monkey has to do with a baseball game.
You just noticed the old Dodger catcher is managing the Angels. You
haven't really been paying attention to the Angels because, well,
nobody ever does, and all of a sudden the Angels are in their first
World Series and you don't know Tim Salmon from Steve Trout.</LD>
<LD>   The Angel bandwagon is expanding by previously unimaginable
proportions. It's never too late, Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio
says, for folks to wear red and jump aboard.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as they're supporting us, I don't care when they came
on," he said.</LD>
<TE>   For all those new fans, here's a crash course in Angel lore. Call
it Bandwagon 101.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's all this about "winning one for the cowboy?"</TE>
<TE>   Gene Autry, America's legendary "Singing Cowboy," bought the
Angels as an expansion franchise in 1960. He is the only man with
five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame--for radio, records, movies,
television and live stage performance--but the world might have been
deprived of those talents had he hit well enough to pass a tryout
with the St. Louis Cardinals. For four decades, he dreamed of seeing
his Angels in the World Series, just once. He died in 1998, at age
91.</TE>
<TE>   So Autry always wanted to own a baseball team?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, no. When the Dodgers moved their broadcasts off Autry's
radio station in 1960, Autry heard that the American League planned
to expand to Los Angeles. He headed to the owners' meetings intending
to acquire the radio rights to the new team. He got the rights ...
and the team.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles? Or Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were born in Los Angeles, playing at a minor league
ballpark (Wrigley Field) in 1961 and sharing Dodger Stadium from
1962-65, calling it Chavez Ravine to spite the Dodgers. They moved to
Anaheim Stadium in 1966, changing the team name from the Los Angeles
Angels to the California Angels. Disney bought the team in 1996 and
changed the name to Anaheim Angels in 1997. The next year, they sold
naming rights to the renovated ballpark and renamed it Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   What color is the halo on the logo?</TE>
<TE>   Which logo? The Angels used a silver halo, then a yellow halo,
then no halo at all, then brought back a silver halo this year. In 42
seasons, the Angels have had more logos (seven) than division
championships (three).</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' checkered history also is reflected by the six uniform
numbers they have retired. Three numbers were retired in honor of men
who never played for the team--Autry, beloved coach Jimmie Reese and
Jackie Robinson, whose number has been retired by every major league
team. Two other numbers were retired in honor of men who entered the
Hall of Fame wearing caps of other teams--Rod Carew (Minnesota Twins)
and Nolan Ryan (Texas Rangers). Jim Fregosi is the other player whose
number has been retired.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan Ryan played for the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   Sure did, from 1972-79. Anaheim was the place where Ryan evolved
from a kid who could throw wondrously hard into a pitcher who set the
major league record for strikeouts in a season (383) and a career
(5,714) and threw four no-hitters.</TE>
<TE>   Why did he leave?</TE>
<TE>   After Ryan went 16-14 during an injury-plagued 1979
season, General Manager Buzzie Bavasi scoffed at Ryan's request for $1
million per year and suggested he would be easily replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "All we have to do is find two 8-7 pitchers," Bavasi said, the
most infamous words uttered in Angel history.</TE>
<TE>   Amid suspicions that the power pitcher might soon run out
of power, Ryan signed with the Houston Astros as a free agent. In 1988,
at age 41, the Angels tried to bring him back as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels partied Sunday, their ticket stamped for the World
Series, Salmon talked about "those stories about one strike away."
What does he mean?</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the Angels' last playoff appearance before this one, they
were one strike away from the World Series. They led the Boston Red
Sox, 5-4, with two out in the ninth inning and two strikes on Dave
Henderson. But Henderson homered, and the shocked Angels lost three
consecutive games--and their Series berth--to the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   The long-suffering Angel fan also winces at two other phrases:
"one win away" and "11-game lead."</TE>
<TE>   "One win away" refers to 1986 and also to 1982, when the
Angels were one victory away from the World Series and lost three
consecutive games to the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Angels coughed up an 11-game lead in six weeks and
missed out on the playoffs. Never has a major league team lost so
large a lead so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   What's the deal with the monkey?</TE>
<TE>   The rally monkey was born two years ago, when two kids on the
video crew were goofing around. They slapped the phrase "rally
monkey" over a clip of a monkey jumping up and down, from the movie
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," then threw the image up on the video
board. The crowd roared. The Angels came back to win.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing manufactured by Disney. Nothing forced. Just sheer fun.</TE>
<TE>   Should we believe in the power of the rally monkey?</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins do. They took a 5-3 lead in the top of the
seventh inning Sunday. In the bottom of the inning, the monkey was
unleashed. The Angels scored 10 runs and headed for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Do I need a rally monkey?</TE>
<TE>   Only you can answer that question, but Disney will be happy to
sell you a stuffed monkey for $20, and they're selling fast. The
Thunder Stix -- those big red things everyone bangs at the
ballpark--are free.</TE>
<TE>   With fans wearing red and waving red sticks, the stands resemble a
sea of red. Much easier to see, and much easier to say, than a "sea
of periwinkle," the goofy shade of blue Disney mercifully abandoned
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since when is the old Dodger catcher managing the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   This is Mike Scioscia's third year as the Angel manager. He and
two Angel coaches, Mickey Hatcher and Alfredo Griffin, played for the
Dodgers' World Series championship team in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   How many playoff games have the Dodgers won since 1988?</TE>
<TE>   None. But you knew that.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome aboard the Angel bandwagon, and here are the lyrics to the
team fight song. The existence of a fight song might surprise even
longtime fans, since the Angels stashed the song in the proverbial
attic for years. This year, with the return of the traditional halo
to the logo, the Angels also brought back the old fight song in one
of their television commercials, changing "California Angels" to
"Anaheim Angels."</LD>
<LD>   The song was written in 1966, the year the Angels moved from Los
Angeles to Anaheim, and copyrighted by Walt Disney Music Co. The
lyrics appeared in the Angel game programs for several years
thereafter; the sheet music currently is on display in the "Baseball
as History" exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<LD>   The "Golden West" referred to the name used by Gene Autry, the
Angels' founding owner, for his baseball and broadcasting companies.
The fight song traditionally preceded Angel broadcasts on Autry's
KMPC (710 AM); that instrumental jingle can be heard as the "Angels
Baseball March" on a Web site devoted to the old radio station at:
http://www.710kmpc.com/jingles.htm.</LD>
<TE>   CHORUS:</TE>
<TE>   California Angels A-OK!!</TE>
<TE>   California Angels all the way!!</TE>
<TE>   Hear them shout that you're the best</TE>
<TE>   Clear throughout "The Golden West"</TE>
<TE>   Watch 'em play night and day. Keep the crowds in the clouds.</TE>
<TE>   California Angels win that game!!</TE>
<TE>   California Angels win that fame!!</TE>
<TE>   Ev'rybody blow your horn! With a halo we adorn the California
Angels team.</TE>
<TE>   INTERLUDE</TE>
<TE>   Short or tall, large or small; Welcome any time!</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners said Monday they are open to letting teams
interview Manager Lou Piniella and will release him from the final
year of his contract if adequate compensation can be arranged.</LD>
<LD>   Piniella told Mariner officials Friday in a meeting at Tampa,
Fla., that he had decided not to return to Seattle for the 2003
season because of personal and family reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Piniella has managed the Mariners for 10 seasons, guiding the team
to three consecutive playoff appearances and a record-tying 116
victories in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Piniella met with Mariner CEO Howard Lincoln, President Chuck
Armstrong and General Manager Pat Gillick.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no other teams have contacted the Mariners, the team said
in a statement. But "in view of his long service to the Mariners,"
the team will entertain contact from interested clubs and seek to
negotiate "reasonable compensation" in exchange for releasing him.</TE>

<TE>   The Angels' American League championship series-clinching victory
over Minnesota on Fox on Sunday, going head to head with the Oakland
Raider-St. Louis Ram game on CBS, got more than double the rating.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel game drew a 16.6 Nielsen rating and a 46 share in Los
Angeles; the football game had a 7.8/17.</TE>
<TE>   The 16.6 was the lowest L.A. rating for the three AL championship
series games at Edison Field, but the 46 share was the highest. Game
3 got a 17.5/32; Game 4 an 18.7/36.</TE>
<TE>   A rating represents a percentage of all television households and
a share represents television households where television is being
watched. Fewer people were watching television Sunday afternoon than
Saturday evening, which explains the lower rating.</TE>
<TE>   In St. Louis, the football game did slightly better than the
Cardinals' game at San Francisco. The Rams got a 34.5/57, the
Cardinals and Giants a 34.4/45 and the Angels and Twins a 5.3/9.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the Cardinals and Giants got a 21.7/37, the
Raiders and Rams a 13.9/34 and the Angels and Twins a 6.6/16.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Twins on Sunday got the highest rating in
Minneapolis-St. Paul--a 31.6/51.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston catcher Gregg Zaun had surgery to repair a partially torn
tendon in his right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Zaun, 31, batted .222 with three home runs and 24 runs batted in
last season, his first with Houston. He sat out the first 98 games of
2002 after injuring his calf during spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Recovery time is expected to be four months.</TE>

<LD>Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "The noose may be tightening
around former Bear [and Trojan] Jeff Fisher's neck in Tennessee.
'We're not looking good,' Titan owner Bud Adams said after last
week's loss to Washington. 'We should be better than we are right
now. It looks to me like we're being out-coached.' "</LD>
<LD>   That didn't happen Sunday. Fisher coached the Titans to a 23-14
victory over Jacksonville.</LD>
<LD>   More Rapoport: "If it seems as though NFL teams are scoring almost
at will these days, that's because they are. After five weeks of
play, the average points per game was 45.7, the most since 1958.</LD>
<TE>   "The single-season record, 46.5 points per game in 1948, could be
in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Where did the Angels play home games in 1961, their
first season?</TE>
<TE>   Desperation time: Don Pierson in the Chicago Tribune: "Whistling
past the graveyard, [Coach] Mike Martz of the 1-5 Rams is searching
history. 'You look at Cincinnati, they started off 1-7 and they made
the playoffs.'</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, it was 1-6, and it was 1970, but the Bengals did make
the playoffs that year, winning their last seven in a 14-game
schedule."</TE>
<TE>   One-sided: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times, commenting on
Florida State's losing another game to Miami when, once again, a
Seminole kicker missed a late field goal:</TE>
<TE>   " ... Miami seems to win the ones that rip the heart out of FSU
and leave it in the grass. FSU has rarely taken something precious
away from Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Bye options: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer, commenting on
the bye week in the NFL:</TE>
<TE>   "If you have lost going into it, then the bye week in the NFL is
like a walking-the-floor toothache at 3 in the morning -- you know
that relief will be awhile in coming.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have won going into it, bye week is party hats and
confetti."</TE>
<TE>   Spare us: Ken Stone in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "Reno tourism
officials said they planned to review details of a private party
involving scantily clad women who performed lap dances at the
National Bowling Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "At least six women mingled with about 150 competitors at the
bowling event, performing lap dances and touching some men. But were
the ladies wearing proper shoes?"</TE>
<TE>   No fishing fan: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"Confess now, does anyone watch those fishing shows on the toob? I
mean, how many ways can you pull a bass to the boat and deliver that
dramatic soliloquy: 'Nice fish!' "</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1950, the Los Angeles Rams defeated
the Lions in Detroit, 30-28.</TE>
<TE>   And, later, in the NFL championship game, the Rams lost by the
same score to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the former
minor league Angels of the Pacific Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Quarterback Trent Dilfer of the Seattle Seahawks on
the fickleness of fans: "The league is so crazy now. A guy has a
couple of bad games, or he doesn't meet everybody's expectations, and
it's not just, 'OK, he's going to be good.' It's, 'He's a dog.' "</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Dooling Finally Could Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keyon Dooling took part in his first full-contact practice since "the
day before he sprained his ankle against the Bulls" as Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry pointed out Monday after a workout at L.A. Southwest
College.</LD>
<LD>   That would be Nov. 13, 2001, the day before Dooling injured
himself in a collision with Chicago's Ron Mercer late in the first
half of the Clippers' 106-102 victory at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Dooling underwent surgery during the off-season, hoping it would
finally allow him to return to the court with some semblance of speed
and explosiveness. He played six games after the injury last season,
but was ineffective because his left ankle lacked strength.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Dooling will join a three-game trip to Milwaukee, Chicago
and Detroit. He hopes to play in at least one of those exhibitions.
If not, he figures he will be ready to play Oct. 23 against Milwaukee
at Staples Center. The season begins Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm aiming for the last two preseason games," Dooling said of his
return. "I'm taking it day by day. I'm not even looking at the
calendar. It feels pretty good. I can't complain. It's been pretty
tough, but you've got to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   Dooling was expected to be Jeff McInnis' backup at point guard
last season, but the injury forced the Clippers to re-evaluate their
depth at the position during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis signed to play with the Portland Trail Blazers. Earl
Boykins, Dooling's replacement, did not return to the Clippers. And
the team pulled off a blockbuster deal by trading reserve forwards
Darius Miles and Harold Jamison to the Cleveland Cavaliers to get
Andre Miller and Bryant Stith.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also signed Marko Jaric, their second-round pick in
the 2000 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Dooling's status in the rotation is as yet undefined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miles recently told ESPN.com the trade last summer from the
Clippers to the Cavaliers hasn't been all that difficult for him. He
misses his best friend, Quentin Richardson, but, apart from being 95
minutes late on media day, things have gone fine for the 20-year-old
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade wasn't hard," Miles said. "The only thing hard about it
is [Richardson] plays [in L.A.]. I got used to those guys and the
fans. But I want to be on the next 50 Greatest Players [list]. I want
to make the All-Star team and elevate my game. I thought I couldn't
do it in L.A. unless they traded me somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us there can't be All-Stars. Eventually, some of us were
going to leave. I was just the first to leave. It was a surprise to
everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a surprise to me. I didn't think I would be the first one
to go, but I didn't mind being the first one to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry raved about the play of center Sean Rooks and forward Corey
Maggette during the first four of the Clippers' eight exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Rooks has been filling in while Michael Olowokandi rehabilitates
his sore left knee. Maggette has replaced Lamar Odom, who has a badly
sprained right ankle, at small forward.</TE>
<TE>   Their fine play is among the reasons the Clippers are 3-1, even
with Olowokandi, Odom, Richardson (knee) and power forward Elton
Brand (knee) out because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Sean Rooks has had as good a camp as he's had over his career,"
Gentry said. "He's the kind of leader we need."</TE>
<TE>   Of Maggette, Gentry said, "Corey has played well. It's hard to get
upset with Corey because of his effort. He needs to work on his
decision-making. You never fault his effort. It's the reason he's out
there."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Bucking The Odds"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Ralph Paulk</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing, L.L.C., Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the Ohio State men's basketball program never could have
imagined in 1997, after the Buckeyes' fourth consecutive losing
season, that a little-known coach named Jim O'Brien could turn around
their tradition-rich program.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the Buckeye faithful still couldn't imagine it. Ohio
State went 8-22 in 1997-98, O'Brien's first season. Yet by 1999, fans
in Columbus were singing a different tune.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State, in O'Brien's second season, went 27-8, finished second
in the Big Ten and made it to the 1999 Final Four. A semifinal loss
to eventual national champion Connecticut ended Ohio State's dream
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes' achievements under O'Brien inspired Ralph Paulk,
former Ohio State beat writer for the Akron Beacon Journal, to write
this book, his first. Paulk, now an author and freelance writer,
provides an in-depth look at O'Brien's revitalization of Ohio State's
program.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, voted the 2001 coach of the year, recently became the
widowed father of two after his wife, Christine, died of
complications from Hodgkin's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had an 18-year-old son, I would want him to play for Jim
O'Brien ... because he would play for a man of impeccable integrity,"
friend Dave Gavitt says.</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Famer Bob Cousy, who wrote the book's foreword and coached
O'Brien as a player at Boston College, says, "He doesn't engage in
spin. The result has been an outstanding coaching career."</TE>
<TE>   And a lot of happy Buckeye fans.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tough Early Stretch Should Pay Off Later</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks are better than they were last season. But they have
the same record as at this time last year.</LD>
<LD>   Their power play looks sharper. But their coach is a little
disappointed with it.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Babcock wants improvement every day. But he doesn't
want the Ducks to put too much pressure on themselves when they don't
win.</LD>
<TE>   This is like walking a tightrope carrying an anvil. And the
balancing act isn't going to get any easier. Babcock has said, "We
have to be in the hunt after 20 games." Trouble is, the Ducks face
nothing but teams that finished above .500 last season for the next
month, starting with the Kings on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to play against the best teams," Babcock said. "A lot
people have said it is negative with the tough schedule. I think it
is so positive, it's not even funny. These teams expose things in us
that we've got to get better at. We want to win at the same time. You
don't want to pressure up because you didn't get a win.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing we said on the ice, we're going to get better today. At
the end, I said, 'Good job, let's get better again tomorrow and then
we'll play L.A.' That's kind of like the exam, just like a kid in
school."</TE>
<TE>   That may sound more like a 12-step program, but the Ducks, off to
a 1-2 start, knew they were in for this kind of rehabilitation. A
positive sign is, they came home from St. Louis and Dallas with a
split, something that was worth celebrating a year ago. Now, they
have raised the bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the mind-set has changed," captain Paul Kariya said.
"That's how we're going to make the playoffs, by not being satisfied
with .500 road trips."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the power play, the Ducks' 23.5% conversion rate
looks impressive, yet they have had more opportunities. They went
scoreless with a five-on-three for 1 minute 16 seconds against
Detroit on Sunday. They also came up empty when the Red Wings'
Mathieu Dandenault went off for a double minor.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that can be attributed to new cast members -- Adam Oates,
Petr Sykora and Fredrik Olausson.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting four or five chances every night," Sykora said.
"It doesn't happen overnight.... You'll see, after 10-20 games, we'll
be scoring big goals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bylsma blamed no one but himself for being a healthy scratch
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job to convince the coach what I can do," Bylsma said. "I
haven't done that the first couple of games."</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma is one of the team's most effective penalty killers. He was
a healthy scratch five of the first 12 games last season, then didn't
miss another game.</TE>

<LD>WORLD SERIES</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS vs. SAN FRANCISCO</LD>
<LD>   Regular-season record: Giants, 95-66; Angels, 99-63.</LD>
<TE>   Head to head: Did not play.</TE>
<TE>   How they got here: Giants defeated Atlanta in NLDS, 3-2; defeated
St. Louis in NLCS, 4-1; Angels defeated New York Yankees in ALDS,
3-1; defeated Minnesota in ALCS, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Team batting: Giants, .267, fourth in NL; Angels, .282, first in
AL.</TE>

<TE>*--*
HOW THEY MATCH UP</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   CATCHER</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago, Giants vs. Bengie Molina, Angels: Santiago
resurrected his career from the scrap heap and has been a clutch
hitter in the playoffs. Molina led the AL in percentage of base
stealers thrown out, but had trouble preventing wild pitches against
the Twins. Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   FIRST BASE</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow, Giants vs. Scott Spiezio, Angels: If there's a better
defensive first baseman than Spiezio, it's probably Snow. Spiezio is
a better hitter. Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND BASE</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent, Giants vs. Adam Kennedy, Angels: Kent has won an MVP
award and is one of the best-hitting second basemen of all time.
Kennedy probably won't hit three homers in a game again, and he sits
against left-handers. Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD BASE</TE>
<TE>   David Bell, Giants vs. Troy Glaus, Angels: Bell is a good defender
and is steady at the plate. Glaus has more power and is better on
defense. Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   SHORTSTOP</TE>
<TE>   Rich Aurilia, Giants vs. David Eckstein, Angels: Both are average
on defense. Aurilia had an off year at the plate, while Eckstein has
been the catalyst on offense for Anaheim. Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   LEFT FIELD</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, Giants vs. Garret Anderson, Angels: Barry Bonds is,
well, Barry Bonds. Anderson is an underrated player and a key to the
Angel offense. Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   CENTER FIELD</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton, Giants vs. Darin Erstad, Angels: Lofton has given
the Giants a solid leadoff man and is their only real base-stealing
threat. Erstad is a perennial Gold Glove candidate who does all the
little things that help you win ballgames. Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   RIGHT FIELD</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders, Giants vs. Tim Salmon, Angels: Sanders has been
through a World Series before -- last season with Arizona. Salmon is
the comeback player of the year, but he struggled against the Twins.
Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   DESIGNATED HITTER</TE>
<TE>   Take your pick, Giants vs. Brad Fullmer/Shawn Wooten, Angels: The
Giants have several options among Shawon Dunston, Tsuyoshi Shinjo,
Marvin Benard and Pedro Feliz. Fullmer and Wooten are solid for
Angels. Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   ROTATION</TE>
<TE>   The Angel quartet of Jarrod Washburn, Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz
and John Lackey were solid against the Twins, though Appier provided
some scary moments. The Giants will rely on Russ Ortiz, Jason
Schmidt, Kirk Rueter and Livan Hernandez. Edge: Angels.</TE>
<TE>   BULLPEN</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have one of the best bullpens in baseball, and a
premier closer in Troy Percival. The Giants have Felix Rodriguez to
match strikeouts with Francisco Rodriguez, plus Robb Nen to close.
Percival is better than Nen. Edge: Angels.</TE>

<HD>Kona Gold Is on Pace for Breeders' Cup Sprint</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If his work on Monday is any indication, Kona Gold is ready for his
fifth consecutive start in the Breeders' Cup Sprint.</LD>
<LD>   Three days before pre-entries are to be taken for the eight
Breeders' Cup races, which will be run at Arlington Park in suburban
Chicago on Oct. 26, the 8-year-old gelding worked five furlongs in 58
2/5 at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Owned in part by trainer Bruce Headley, Kona Gold, who won the
Breeders' Cup Sprint two years ago, will be trying for his 14th
victory in his 25th start.</LD>
<TE>   "He's never been working this well," said regular rider Alex
Solis, who was aboard for the exercise. "He's working out of this
world. It's so amazing how fast and how easily he is doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Vindication, an unbeaten 2-year-old and one of the
top contenders in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, worked seven furlongs
in 1:23 4/5. Trained by Bob Baffert, Vindication galloped out a mile
in 1:37 with jockey Mark Smith riding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel made it two stakes wins in three days when
favored Kithira won the first division of the $83,300 Harold C.
Ramser Sr. Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Rolly Polly had scored a narrow win in the Sen. Ken
Maddy Handicap, Kithira, a 3-year-old, English-bred filly and the 9-5
choice, wore down pacesetter and 5-2 second choice Super High to win
by a head in 1:33 3/5 for the mile on turf.</TE>
<TE>   About an hour earlier, Frankel, who is in New York, had won the
$114,300 Pebbles Handicap at Belmont Park with 2-1 second choice
Gila. In a race switched from turf to dirt because of recent wet
weather, the 3-year-old A.P. Indy filly won by 3 1/4 lengths and
completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 3/5 under jockey Javier Castellano.
Nonsuch Bay, the 9-5 second choice, was second in a field reduced to
five starters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kristin Mulhall, the 20-year-old daughter of Richard Mulhall, a
former trainer and the current racing manager for the Thoroughbred
Corp., earned her first stakes win as a trainer when lukewarm
Sentimental Value ($8) took the second division of the Ramser, which
had a purse of $84,300.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old Diesis filly stalked the early pace set by longshot
Shezasummerbreeze, took control into the stretch and won by two
lengths in 1:33 4/5. She was ridden by Victor Espinoza.</TE>

<LD>Markisha Lea, a 6-foot forward from Riverside King, became the second
area player in the last week to commit to the USC women's basketball
team.</LD>
<LD>   Lea, who averaged 21 points and 12 rebounds last season, will be
joined by Harbor City Narbonne guard Jamie Funn at USC. Lea's
brother, Marvin, is a freshman guard at Pepperdine.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Ekene Ibekwe, a 6-foot-9 All-City forward from Carson who averaged
19.5 points and 7.5 rebounds last season, announced Monday he has
committed to defending NCAA champion Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake boys' water polo team hopes a
change of scenery will give it an edge against Long Beach Wilson this
week.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines play host to Wilson in a nonleague game at 7 p.m.
Saturday. The Bruins (14-0) are No. 1 in The Times' rankings and
Harvard-Westlake (13-1) is No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson defeated Harvard-Westlake, 10-7, late Saturday night in the
championship game of the S&amp;R Sport Cup at Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach. The Bruins also defeated Harvard-Westlake, 9-7, in the
Southern Section Division I championship game last season, also at
Belmont Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   In a nonleague game last season at Harvard-Westlake, the
Wolverines defeated Wilson, 9-7, marking the their first victory over
the Bruins since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   --Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Coach Bill Tokar had his druthers, his Ventura girls'
cross-country team would be overlooked and relatively unknown at this
point in the season.</TE>
<TE>   But there is little chance of that happening after the Cougars won
the large-schools race of the Clovis Invitational at Woodward Park in
Fresno on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ventura did not run in the championship race against some
of the state's top-ranked Division I teams in Fresno, the Cougars'
performance in the large-schools race would have placed them second
behind Canyon Country Canyon in the premier event.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team time was pretty good," Tokar said. "We had a nice
[15-second] gap between our [No. 1 and 4] runners, but we're still
developing our No. 5."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Werner of Canyon Country Canyon beat highly regarded teammate
Ryan Morgan for the first time in his career Saturday when he placed
fourth in the boys' championship race in the Clovis Invitational, but
he was more excited about finishing ahead of runners such as Mike
Chavez of Anaheim Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who placed seventh Saturday, was seventh in the Southern
Section Division I final last year and ran 9 minutes 9.52 seconds in
the 3,200 meters during track season.</TE>
<TE>   Werner has never broken 9:50 in the 3,200.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to beat Ryan," Canyon co-Coach Dave DeLong said
about Werner. "He knows we're a better team if Ryan finishes ahead of
him."</TE>
<TE>   --John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An appeal by High Desert League member Acton Vasquez to be allowed
to compete in football and baseball in the Christian League was
recently denied by Southern Section officials.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez had applied to join the Christian League in all sports
earlier this year, but was not admitted because the school is located
more than 70 miles from the closest league member. Vasquez accepted
the league's offer to join for baseball and football.</TE>
<TE>   However, section rules limit schools to one primary league, though
they may participate in a different league if a sport is not
available in their primary league. Vasquez has been relegated to
freelance status for football this season.</TE>

<LD>Sixty-eight spectators stand along the sidelines or sit in portable
bleachers as they watch a seemingly out-of-season soccer match on a
recent afternoon at Crossroads Soccer Complex in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a mile away, nearly 2,000 fans gather at Santa Monica
College for a nonleague football game between L.A. Loyola--with a
roster of 67 varsity players--and Antelope Valley.</LD>
<LD>   At the football game, an announcer provides play-by-play
description over the stadium sound system and spectators follow the
action with the help of a professionally printed program that
included rosters for both teams. They do so in relative comfort,
sitting in grandstands with backs on the bleachers as a school band
jams, pep squad members cheer and a mascot dances under the glare of
lights on Friday night. A trail of smoke drifts with the tantalizing
aroma of barbecued hot dogs, chicken and ribs.</LD>
<TE>   For the Santa Monica New Roads versus La Canada Delphi match at
the soccer complex, there are no announcers, programs or concessions,
just boys and girls running the field in a coed game -- the
centerpiece of sports activity this fall for about 18 tiny Southern
California high schools.</TE>
<TE>   They play in the International League, one of two circuits -- the
Condor League is the other -- that play fall futbol instead of
football as a concession to the small enrollments of their members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a little bit different," said Max Shereshevsky, a
junior forward for Delphi. "We're basically in our own little world
here."</TE>
<TE>   Little is the operative word.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have 50 people at these games, it's a good crowd," said
David Bryan, the head administrator at New Roads, which has an
enrollment of 236, mid-sized by small-school standards.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment at the 11 schools in International League soccer ranges
from 52 students at La Canada Renaissance Academy to 302 at San
Gabriel Academy. That's quite a difference when compared to the
combined enrollment of 3,757 at Antelope Valley and Loyola highs.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the match between New Roads and Delphi, which ended
in a scoreless tie, was just as important to the players and fans as
was Loyola's 21-19 victory over Antelope Valley to football fans.
Parents and friends of the soccer players cheered every tackle and
agonized over missed scoring opportunities with similar abandon.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually go to Santa Monica football games, and it's almost
identical to that, but on a smaller level," New Roads student Eamon
Cannon said as he watched the soccer match.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same type of thing -- but it's more personal."</TE>
<TE>   The International League began competition in the fall of 1989 --
at the request of officials at San Marino Southwestern Academy and
Pico Rivera Mesrobian. Those schools didn't offer football but had
students who wanted to play soccer and basketball, both of which are
winter sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer is extremely popular here," said Southwestern Academy
Athletic Director Robert Gibbs, who first petitioned the Southern
Section to sanction fall soccer. "You have a small number of
students, some who want to be athletes, and a lot of kids who have
never played on a sports team."</TE>
<TE>   A combination of factors contributes to decisions to offer soccer
instead of football, including the small enrollment and soccer being
a better fit for academics-oriented schools, many with large
contingents of students born in other countries. Tiny athletic talent
pools, lack of facilities, safety and liability concerns and budget
constraints are other factors.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons, International League soccer is growing. San
Gabriel and Renaissance academies and Los Angeles Shalhevet joined
the league this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great program because, otherwise, we would never be able
to compete in sports," said Cesar Jimenez, the coach at Delphi, which
has an enrollment of 76.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of girls is commonplace because separate girls'
soccer programs are not offered.</TE>
<TE>   Girls on football teams have become more common for the same
reason. But they usually get into games as kickers, while senior
midfielder Kellyn Fahey is a Delphi team captain and Glendale
Adventist junior midfielder Cristina Mirzakhanian is her team's
second-leading scorer with five goals. Both players start and play
most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's not out of place, like it might be in football," said
Dave Newman, the soccer coach at Granada Hills Hillcrest Christian.
"There are ways that a girl can be as successful as boys in soccer,
by being smart, aggressive and having good skills. Sure, they're not
going to be as strong as a 260-pound guy, but that's not soccer."</TE>
<TE>   In the International League, it's not football, either.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have three or four guys here big enough to play
lineman," said Gibbs. "We don't have gigantic guys, so it's a more
level playing field."</TE>
<TE>   It's just not a football field.</TE>

Fresno on Saturday. The Jackrabbits had an impressive 16-second gap
between their No. 1 and 5 runners while defeating runner-up Canyon
Country Canyon, 93-163. Dana Hills, the preseason No. 1, drops to
eighth as top runner Tyler Kastorff missed his third consecutive meet
because of back spasms.</LD>

and did not have senior standout Anne Yelsey, who has an injured
knee, so the shakeup at the top could be temporary. Calabasas fell to
Santa Barbara on games while short-handed, but won't slide yet. Then

<HD>A Challenge? Delgadillo Ready to Dive In</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One day, Juan Delgadillo might gather his grandchildren around a
rocking chair and tell a story that will produce laughter and
disbelief.</LD>
<LD>   It takes place when Delgadillo was 7. A friend invited him to try
out for the novice swim team at a city pool in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   One problem: Delgadillo didn't know how to swim.</LD>
<TE>   "I had never taken a swimming lesson," he said. "The coach took me
aside and said, 'Swim a lap.' I was like, 'Does he know that I don't
know how to swim?' "</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo had been in the shallow part of a pool to dip his feet.
He also had watched his two older sisters swim. But he was told, not
asked. "So I went for it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo didn't drown. He improvised so well that the coach put
him on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day since, I've been committed to swimming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo has grown to 6 feet 3, 180 pounds. A senior, he leads
North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake High's 13-1 water polo team with 39
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Rich Corso: "He likes challenges. That's part of his
personality. I'm lucky he went to [the pool] instead of football or
soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is the first Latino to play water polo in Corso's 17
years at Harvard-Westlake. He transferred to the school after his
freshman year at Santa Monica High. He remembers being the only
Latino on campus as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of weird," he said. "The next year, there were
others, then five. I had to study more and find friends outside water
polo. That was hard. Most [of the students] were curious to see where
I was from, where I grew up."</TE>
<TE>   His parents were born in Mexico. His father runs a clothing
business in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard-Westlake, with its $18,500 per-year tuition, isn't often a
destination for minorities. "Not that many Hispanics apply to this
school," Delgadillo said. "I only knew the school because of water
polo."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a high grade-point average and financial aid, Delgadillo
was able to enroll at the school, where he has fit in and flourished.
He was first-team All-Southern Section selection in water polo as a
junior and is considering attending such schools as Stanford,
California or UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great role model," Corso said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to Harvard-Westlake was almost a leap of faith for
Delgadillo. His friends in Santa Monica didn't want him to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "They were bummed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his interview to enter Harvard-Westlake, Delgadillo said he
was told, "Most people with 4.0 grade-point averages don't get in."</TE>
<TE>   But he also knew that the school "wanted a growing population of
minorities."Only 3.5% of Harvard-Westlake's 1,558 students, grades
seven through 12, are Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Headmaster Thomas Hudnut said there has been much discussion about
increasing student diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't understand we have a $3.5-million financial-aid
budget," he said. "Things are possible."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo already understands how sports and education are
opening doors for his future. Math is his best subject, environmental
science is his favorite, and playing water polo is what makes him
happy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very physical," he said. "You have to learn how to swim and
pass, and there's a lot of technique. We don't wear helmets. We get a
lot of scratches and bruises."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is a crucial contributor on a team that lost to Long
Beach Wilson in last year's Division I final and lost to Wilson,
10-7, in last weekend's championship game of the S &amp; R Sport Cup. The
two schools meet again Saturday at Harvard-Westlake in a nonleague
game.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is a future college athlete and will never forget that
fateful day when he jumped into a pool not knowing if he could stay
afloat, let alone swim.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where it all started, swimming that one lap," he said.</TE>

<HD>There's Still Plenty for Frolov to Fix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his first NHL game, Alexander Frolov was benched for a short
time because he stayed on the ice too long during his shifts.</LD>
<LD>   Before his second game, his coach said of the 6-foot-3, 195-pound
Russian right wing, "We've got a guy we think can be the rookie of
the year."</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, however, Coach Andy Murray said of Frolov's performance
in Saturday night's 3-2 win over the Detroit Red Wings, "I didn't
like his game near as much as I liked his first game."</LD>
<TE>   For all his potential, Frolov is very much a work in progress,
understandable considering he's only 20 and has played all of 23
minutes 56 seconds in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Frolov, rookie of the year last season in the Russian Super
League, arrived at camp last month without skates or equipment but
made an impression after being fitted with a pair of skates from the
pro shop at the Kings' training facility.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got good skills," linemate Eric Belanger said. "He's strong.
But he's got to learn a lot of things. It's totally a different style
of game from where he played. He's got to learn to be tough on the
puck and get the puck out of his zone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good kid. He's really smart. He's learning the language
fast, so he's going to learn the game fast. We've just got to be
patient."</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray, "Certainly, the best measuring stick will come after
20 games, I would say. But by the same token, he has to be a
contributor. We can't have guys in our lineup who aren't
contributing, whether they're rookies or not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy sat out practice because of a strained groin but is
still expected to play Wednesday night against the Mighty Ducks....
Murray hinted that backup goaltender Jamie Storr would play in one of
three games this week. Storr made three of his 12 starts last season
against the Ducks, going 2-0-1 with one shutout, a 1.30 goals-against
average and .953 save percentage. Felix Potvin was 2-0 with a 1.50
GAA and .945 save percentage.... For the record: Jason Allison will
be paid $6.5 million this season, $8 million next.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Believe It, Life Isn't Perfect for Fox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many have envied Rick Fox's wonderful life, his championships as a
Laker, his celebrity as an actor, his marriage to a beauty queen and
Broadway entertainer, but then there is this: He was trounced on a
tennis court over the summer by "Friends" star Matthew Perry.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought he was going to be the other celebrity who couldn't
play tennis, that he was coming to provide the laughs," Fox said with
a grin Monday morning,</LD>
<LD>   At a Manhattan Beach charity event that featured Jennifer Capriati
and Perry against Serena Williams and Fox, well, let's just say
nobody ever hit the ball to Serena.</LD>
<TE>   "He was like a junior tennis stud or something," Fox said of
Perry. "He was really good. Ticked me off.... The guy could play. So,
I swore on that tennis court that day that I would be back and I
would be better."</TE>
<TE>   Fox began taking tennis lessons on the court he built two years
ago at home in Chappaqua, N.Y. He became obsessed, dropped his
beloved golf and hung out with Pete Sampras and his entourage at the
U.S. Open, all in the name of tennis revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, his summer was rather dreary, in a big, famous movie
star sense.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA Finals ended just in time for him to appear in the final
episode of HBO's "Oz," reprising his role as Jackson Vahue.</TE>
<TE>   He had a part in "Holes," the movie based on the children's book
by Louis Sachar.</TE>
<TE>   When that was through, he worked on Showtime's "Street Time,"
where he has a recurring role in the series as a parolee.</TE>
<TE>   He made television commercials for an automobile company and
continued to do ads for Skechers.</TE>
<TE>   And, he frolicked in Westchester County with his wife, Vanessa,
and five children, one born to the two of them and four from previous
relationships. Vanessa recently extended her contract with the
Broadway play "Into the Woods" through the holidays, then intends to
live in Los Angeles, where she is developing a television show.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, and partly because of his passion for tennis, Fox
arrived at camp in typically terrific shape and even leaner than he
was last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson said Monday he would decide by the weekend whether
to divest himself of his Laker interest to become part owner of the
Seattle SuperSonics, and so follow Jerry West as the second Laker
Hall-of-Famer in six months to align himself with another
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson met this weekend with SuperSonic owner Howard Schultz, a
man he said he admired very much. But, Johnson is first a
businessman, and he said there are very basic issues that could keep
him in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They're losing money," he said. "We're making it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson owns 5% of the Lakers, a piece he said would be very
difficult to give up. At this moment, he said, he's more likely to
stay with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having fun here, so it's a tough deal," he said. "I love
Howard, though. I would love to do something with him.</TE>
<TE>   "But, the deal just doesn't stand up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have 12 players under guaranteed contracts, and
although another player or two -- center Soumaila Samake and guard
Jannero Pargo are playing well and are most often mentioned -- would
be luxury-tax expensive, it would not be impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Our standard procedure here is that if a guy's good enough, we
usually find a way to keep him," General Manager Mitch Kupchak said.</TE>

<LD>The Philadelphia 76ers signed center Olden Polynice on Monday after
he sat out all of last season. Contract terms were not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Polynice, a 7-footer who has played for five other teams during
his 14-year career, did not re-sign with the Utah Jazz before last
season.</LD>
<LD>   Polynice, 37, has averaged 7.8 points and 6.7 rebounds in his
career. In his last season with Utah, he averaged 5.3 points and 4.7
rebounds.</LD>

<TE>   The Milwaukee Bucks signed guard Michael Redd to a multiyear
contract almost two weeks after he agreed to a $12-million offer
sheet with the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks had 15 days to match the offer sheet to the restricted
free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Redd was a second-round pick in 2000 and appeared in 67 games last
season. He averaged 11.4 points and 3.3 rebounds and shot over 44%
from three-point range.</TE>

<TE>   Cleveland Cavalier center Zydrunas Ilgauskas was suspended by the
NBA for one game after being arrested last month for drunken driving.</TE>
<TE>   Ilgauskas will miss Cleveland's regular-season opener at
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Ilgauskas, 27, pleaded no contest to drunken driving on
Sept. 15 and was sentenced to one year's probation. A 30-day jail
sentence was suspended and Ilgauskas was fined $1,000.</TE>

<LD>The Pacific League champion Seibu Lions defeated the Chiba Lotte
Marines on Monday in their last regular-season game this season, but
Lion fans were let down by Alex Cabrera's failure to break Japan's
home run record.</LD>
<LD>   Cabrera -- formerly with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- had one hit
in four at-bats.</LD>
<LD>   On Oct. 2, Cabrera tied the Japanese season record of 55 home
runs, set by the legendary Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and matched by Tuffy
Rhodes last year.</LD>
<TE>   Frustration mounted last week for Cabrera, a 30-year-old from
Venezuela, when he accused pitchers of jinxing his chances of
breaking the record by throwing away from him.</TE>
<TE>   But in his final three games, he found more pitches to hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disappointing I could not break the home run record,"
Cabrera said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I appreciate the pitchers contesting with me more than I
thought since hitting the record of 55."</TE>

<TE>   Agustin Calleri defeated James Blake, 6-4, 6-2, in the first round

6-2, 6-2, and Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian beat Francisco
Clavet, 6-1, 6-1.... Fifth-seeded Jelena Dokic defeated Iva Majoli,
6-1, 6-4, in the first round of the Swisscom Challenge at Zurich,

<TE>   Nebraska quarterback Jammal Lord was ticketed in Lincoln, Neb.,
for disturbing the peace.</TE>
<TE>   Lord and Greichaly Cepero, a women's basketball and volleyball

<LD>Miami Dolphin quarterback Jay Fiedler will sit out at least four
weeks because of a broken right thumb.</LD>
<LD>   Fiedler underwent surgery Monday, Dolphin trainer Kevin O'Neill
said. Ray Lucas will start at quarterback against Buffalo on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Fiedler was injured with about 3:30 left in Miami's victory over
Denver on Sunday night. He hit his throwing hand on a helmet while
completing a five-yard pass to Ricky Williams.</LD>
<TE>   Fiedler remained in the game and played the final series, setting
up Olindo Mare's 53-yard winning field goal with two completions
totaling 39 yards in the final seconds.</TE>

<TE>   Chicago Bear running back Anthony Thomas helped pull a man from a
burning car.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 rookie of the year was on his way to visit teammate David
Terrell late Sunday when he saw a smoldering car on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was smoking at first, but it wasn't really on fire,"
Thomas said. "But when I got there and I pulled over, it sounded
like, 'Boom!' and then a tire popped and a big fire blew out.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see a car fire you never know if it's going to blow up
or not. So the main thing, I was trying to get the guy away from the
car and get me and my wife away from the car."</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured. Police said Monday their report on the
incident was not available.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears had a bye Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   Carolina Panther quarterback Rodney Peete will have surgery today
on his right knee and will be sidelined at least three weeks, making
Chris Weinke the starter again. Coach John Fox said Peete had been
playing with torn cartilage in the knee.... Kansas City Chief
defensive tackle Ryan Sims, the sixth pick in this year's draft, is
probably out for the season because of a broken elbow suffered in the
Chiefs' loss to San Diego on Sunday.... Jacksonville Jaguar right
tackle Maurice Williams is out for the season because of a broken
right leg. He will have surgery Wednesday.... Green Bay Packer left
tackle Chad Clifton has a torn knee ligament and is expected to sit
out one to three weeks.</TE>

<TE>   Steve Spurrier backed off his criticism of his players, and
instead directed some toward the officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Redskins' coach said he was "probably a little too
critical, too harsh" when he accused some of the players of not
caring about the game Sunday, when the Redskins lost to the New
Orleans Saints, 43-27.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe we are a pretty good team -- when we play like
it," Spurrier said. "We've only played like it twice this year. We've
got to try to regroup and play like we know what we're doing most of
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier said he wants a better job from the officials, violating
his usual self-imposed policy of not talking about the officiating
after a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting a lot of these little calls that nobody sees
anything that happens," Spurrier said. "You see a flag at the end of
the play -- it has nothing to do with the play -- and yet we're
getting them."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The NFL's only winless team isn't going to change.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Dick LeBeau kept his job Monday, an indication that the
Cincinnati Bengals are content to stay the course through a 12th
consecutive dismal season.</LD>
<LD>   LeBeau's future was cloudy after the Bengals lost to the
Pittsburgh Steelers, 34-7, on Sunday, making them the only team in
the NFL that hasn't won a game.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Mike Brown held his customary meeting with the
coaching staff Monday morning and never raised the subject of
changes, LeBeau said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been very proud to be a Cincinnati Bengal," LeBeau
said. "I sought this job, and I think it was a very good thing in the
life of Dick LeBeau that I got this job. And I'm going to work my
tail off to get this job done."</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals haven't had a winning season since Brown took over in
1991, going an NFL-worst 53-129.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all of the losing, he's loathe to change coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The loss to Pittsburgh left the Bengals 0-6 for the fifth time in
the last 12 years and gave the impression of a team in shambles.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals are heading into their bye weekend, a convenient time
for a coaching change.</TE>
<TE>   Things got so bad Sunday that linebacker Takeo Spikes chastised
teammates by name in the locker room at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, rookie Antwaan Randle El returned the second-half
kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown, giving Pittsburgh a 31-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Spikes said Monday that he went into his halftime tirade because
he respects LeBeau and the Bengals were making him look bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick LeBeau is a great coach," Spikes said. "I don't think
there's enough guys on this team that understand that, and I hate
when we go out there and [play] the way we do, because it shows a
reflection on him."</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau, 65, was promoted from defensive coordinator to his first
head coaching job after Bruce Coslet quit three games into the 2000
season.</TE>
<TE>   During their 35-year history, the Bengals have fired a coach
during a season only twice -- Bill Johnson in 1978 and Dave Shula in
1996.</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Lewis Tries to Strike a Balance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Lewis is not Scotty Bowman. Doesn't look like him, doesn't act
like him, doesn't let sentences meander miles from their origin, as
Bowman did, and he looks people in the eye when he speaks.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis faces the daunting task of succeeding the man who coached
the Detroit Red Wings to a record ninth Stanley Cup championship last
spring. And although he acknowledges his debts to Bowman and Al
Arbour, his coach during his formative years with the New York
Islanders, Lewis is smart enough not to copy them.</LD>
<LD>   He's taking the best of what Bowman and Arbour taught him and
adding his own ideas as he leads the Red Wings in defense of their
Cup title. So far, so good: The Red Wings, who will be without
captain Steve Yzerman until January while the veteran center recovers
from knee surgery, started the season with a 2-1 trip through San
Jose, Los Angeles and Anaheim. They will make their home debut
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "Dave is certainly his own man," forward Brendan Shanahan said.
"As far as the system or the personnel, the transition has been easy
because a lot of things remain the same. Dave Lewis is being Dave
Lewis, and that's great. It's the reason he was hired."</TE>
<TE>   Being Dave Lewis means being demanding but not tyrannical.
Listening, but not being fooled. Using his 15 years' NHL experience
-- including four with the Kings -- and 14 years' experience on
Detroit's coaching staff to know when to push players and when to
stroke them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been stepping up and being more vocal as a head coach, which
he has to do," said defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom, voted the most
valuable player in last spring's Cup run and a two-time Norris Trophy
winner. "It's been an easy transition for us."</TE>
<TE>   Two key changes are Lewis' willingness to use young players in
crucial situations and his efforts to maintain communication with
players. Bowman, undeniably a hockey genius, distanced himself from
players and rarely explained his moves. Lewis plans occasional
one-on-one chats with players to keep them informed and to hear what
they're thinking, a practice he began before the recent trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve's not around, so I met with some players and sat down and
said we expect leadership from them," Lewis said. "Simple things like
that. They probably know it, but it's a good thing to hear.... For
me, as a player, I always wanted communication."</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, he has succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   "The communication is great. You know where you stand and what's
expected of you," forward Darren McCarty said. "It's been as smooth a
transition as you could expect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really business as usual, and it's been great. We expect to
win, and Dave expects us to win, so we just go out and work hard."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis doesn't think of himself as following in Bowman's large
footsteps. As he sees it, he's doing the job for which he has trained
the last 29 years under some of the most astute coaches. Whether he
will become their equal is impossible to predict, but his smarts and
the Red Wings' talent should give him a good start.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want is to give players an opportunity to be successful,"
he said. "A new coach could have come in and the continuity could
have been shaken, and that's one thing management didn't want to
change.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as this is a challenge and an opportunity for me to
have a chance to win. If you're a player or a coach, that's all you
want."</TE>
<TE>   The Commish Speaks</TE>
<TE>   During a meeting last week with Times reporters and editors, NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman hinted that the participation of NHL
players in the 2006 Olympics at Turin, Italy isn't a sure thing,
despite good TV ratings from the Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to the Olympics is always a mixed bag," he said. "On
balance, I'm glad we went. I think the tournament in Salt Lake City
was spectacular for hockey. But it wasn't without its critics. On
balance, it was the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not even focused on 2006. We have to get through 2004
and collective bargaining with the players first.... It will be even
more difficult to go to Italy than Salt Lake City. The length of the
break would have to be longer and time zones would be different."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that despite complaints from fans, the new protective
netting will remain behind the goals. The nets became mandatory after
young fan Brittanie Cecil died last season as the result of being
struck in the head by a puck in Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   "If you sit there fixated, staring at the net, it will be
distracting," he said. "If you watch the game, within a minute you
won't know it's there.... Some have suggested we've overreacted. I'm
not going to apologize for doing the right thing here."</TE>
<TE>   The nets do obstruct views from high-priced seats, but safety
comes first. The ideal solution would be the development of a
light-colored mesh that would provide the same protection without
being so obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Beginner's Luck</TE>
<TE>   Rick Nash, the first pick in the June entry draft, scored his
first goal in his first game with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He got
it on his second shot but, undoubtedly, it was only the first goal of
many to come.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sense it -- when he gets the puck, there's excitement,"
Columbus Coach Dave King said. "He's got this intangible that the top
players seem to have. The puck seems to follow them around."</TE>
<TE>   Nash, an 18-year-old left wing, said he was encouraged by the
success enjoyed last season by youngsters such as Ilya Kovalchuk and
Dany Heatley of Atlanta. "It just shows that these guys can do it, so
why can't I?" he said. "Hopefully, I can do as well."</TE>
<TE>   Nash is one of five 2002 first-round picks on season-opening
rosters. The others are Jay Bouwmeester of Florida (third overall),
Scottie Upshall of Nashville (sixth), Pierre-Marc Bouchard of
Minnesota (eighth) and Steve Eminger of Washington (12th).</TE>
<TE>   And Bad Luck</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger, who underwent wrist surgery
last summer, might require another operation that could keep him out
until March.</TE>
<TE>   That would be devastating to the Blues, who rely on him to play
more than 30 minutes a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, not too many defensemen in the league can do the
things Chris does," Coach Joel Quenneville said. "We're going to have
to overcome that.... We've been spoiled in the past, with Prongs and
Al [MacInnis] on the ice the most minutes of every game. Prongs isn't
going to be around for a while, and it's a great opportunity for our
young guys to get some quality ice time, and through that, we feel
they're going to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Barret Jackman, who had two games' NHL experience before this
season, and Finnish veteran Tom Koivisto are expected to pick up some
of the slack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to lose a guy like that," forward Pavol Demitra said,
"but we just have to forget about it and give the young guys a chance
to show off. They have to grab their chance."</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Byron Dafoe and defenseman Kyle McLaren, who played for
the Bruins last season, remain unsigned. Dafoe is an unrestricted
free agent but McLaren -- who never lived up to expectations as the
successor to Bobby Orr and Ray Bourque -- is a restricted free agent.</TE>
<TE>   After riding with a Navy friend in an F-14 with the Blue Angels,
San Jose winger Teemu Selanne will find commercial flights boring.
After the 45-minute flight, he called Shark General Manager Dean
Lombardi and left this message on Lombardi's voice mail: "Dean, I got
some bad news." After an ominous pause, he added, "The flight was OK,
but it was so smooth, now for every road trip I want to go on this
kind of plane."</TE>
<TE>   Ranger winger Pavel Bure has recovered from knee surgery, but was
knocked out of the lineup by a strep throat. He was expected to make
his season debut tonight.... The NHL eliminated many statistical
categories from its game reports, such as hits, take-aways and
give-aways. Some agents insist the league wanted to minimize the
ammunition players can use in contract negotiations, and there might
be some truth to that. Even so, home-town favoritism and varying
definitions of what constituted a hit or a take-away often distorted
the numbers and made them unreliable.</TE>

<HD>Lemieux Fuels Payback Win by Penguins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Lemieux wasn't about to let the Toronto Maple Leafs humiliate
the Pittsburgh Penguins again.</LD>
<LD>   Lemieux scored twice and assisted on Alexei Morozov's two
power-play goals, and the Penguins recovered from their worst
opening-game loss with a 5-4 victory over the Maple Leafs on Monday
night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   The Penguins have won two in a row after a 6-0 loss to Toronto on
Thursday at home.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not revenge, but we were embarrassed in the first game,"
Lemieux said. "All hockey players have pride. You have to come back
and play better and that's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, who had two goals in a 6-0 victory over the New York
Rangers on Saturday, scored the game-winner on the power play with
2:18 left when his shot from behind the net deflected off Trevor
Kidd's pads.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in our house and abused us in the first game," goalie
Johan Hedberg said. "We really wanted to come here and beat them."</TE>
<TE>   Tie Domi, Mats Sundin, Darcy Tucker and Alexander Mogilny scored
power-play goals for the Maple Leafs, who have lost two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny appeared to score the tying goal with 24 seconds
remaining, but it was taken away after it was ruled that Toronto's
Shayne Corson knocked the net off its moorings before the puck went
in.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a goal for sure," Corson said. "The puck was in
before it came off."</TE>
<TE>   After Domi gave Toronto a 1-0 lead early in the first, Lemieux
tied it with his third goal this season and the 657th of his career.
He fired a slap shot past Kidd at 10:01.</TE>
<TE>   Sundin gave Toronto the lead again with his 400th goal. He
received a standing ovation after Mogilny found him alone at the side
of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll cherish that. It was awesome, but too bad we didn't get the
two points," Sundin said.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 2, Colorado 1 -- Sergei Samsonov scored a power-play goal
with half a second to play to lift the Bruins at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Boston scored on its 17th power-play shot of the game after Milan
Hejduk was penalized for pulling down P.J. Axelsson on a partial
breakaway at 19:15 of the final period.</TE>
<TE>   "I went low to the glove side," Samsonov said. "I was surprised
when it went in. How many times are you going to score goals like
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Boston's John Grahame made 24 saves, and Colorado's Patrick Roy
had 35.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being outshot, 12-6, in the first period, the Avalanche
led, 1-0, on Martin Skoula's power-play goal at 7:00.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Lapointe tied it with a power-play goal at 10:50 of the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Columbus 2 -- Daniel Briere assisted on two of the
Coyotes' three power-play goals at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The game set Columbus records for most penalties by the Blue
Jackets (15), an opponent (19) and combined penalty minutes (108).</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes converted only two of 13 power-play chances in losing
their first two games this season, but scored on two of their first
three opportunities against Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Ladislav Nagy, Shane Doan and Paul Mara had power-play goals.
Landon Wilson scored an even-strength goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an odd game -- a lot of penalties. I think that's going to
be the norm in the NHL this year," said Brian Boucher, who made 30
saves for the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Vancouver 2 -- Rookie Chuck Kobasew scored with 4:38
left, and the Flames rallied from a two-goal deficit at Vancouver,
Canada, to win for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kobasew's shot from the slot went off the block of Dan Cloutier
and bounced in off defenseman Ed Jovanovski, who was tied up with
Marc Savard driving to the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks were trying for their fourth 3-0 start in their
33-year history.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 28, SEATTLE 21</KH>
<HD>In 49ers' Victory, Writing Is on Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Terrell Owens had it all over Shawn Springs on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Twice.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did the all-pro receiver catch a 37-yard touchdown pass
over the Seattle cornerback to give San Francisco a 28-21 victory
over the Seahawks, but he added an extra flourish by pulling out a
pen and autographing the ball for a friend sitting in Springs' suite.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle (1-4) led, 21-20, and was driving for another score when
Ahmad Plummer intercepted an ill-advised pass by Trent Dilfer at the
San Francisco 32-yard line with 10 minutes left. The 49ers moved from
there to the Seattle 37. Jeff Garcia found Owens deep down the left
side and he took the ball over Springs for the score.</TE>
<TE>   He then took a pen from his sock and signed the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what big players do," Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said,
referring to the catch, not the autograph.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia then passed to Garrison Hearst for a two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   The victory kept the 49ers (4-1) one game ahead of Arizona in the
NFC West, which Seattle joined this season, moving from the AFC West
in realignment. The 49ers won the division 14 times between 1981 and
1997. With St. Louis' demise this season, they are a heavy favorite
to win it again this season.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia threw for 202 yards and the two TDs and ran seven times for
48 yards, including 17- and 12-yard scrambles on a second-quarter
drive that led to a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco took a 10-0 lead on Jose Cortez's 37-yard field goal
and Garcia's eight-yard TD pass to Owens, who finished with six
catches for 84 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The field goal came on a 73-yard drive off the opening kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Then Zack Bronson, who later left the game with a broken foot,
intercepted a pass by Dilfer on Seattle's first possession. The 49ers
took six plays to complete the drive when Garcia rolled right and
found Owens all alone on the goal line and he stepped into the end
zone.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle responded immediately, going 69 yards in 10 plays to score
on Dilfer's five-yard touchdown pass to Mack Strong with 1:45 left in
the first quarter. Dilfer had two critical third-and-long completions
to Bobby Engram on the drive.</TE>
<TE>   Then Engram struck again. He took Jason Baker's punt at his 39,
broke a tackle and was free, weaving his way 61 yards to give Seattle
a 14-10 lead with 5:41 left before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez's 29-yard field goal on the next drive made it 14-13 and
that's the way the half ended.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers' first possession of the second half was their best -- a
12-play, 99-yard drive primarily on the ground capped by Kevan
Barlow's six-yard run off left tackle for a 20-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Back came Seattle. Shaun Alexander went 42 yards on the first play
from scrimmage, then capped the 76-yard drive with a one-yard run
with 1:11 left in the third quarter to make it 21-20.</TE>

<HD>Giant Challenge Ahead</HD>
<DH>Angels' World Series opponent is decided as Lofton's hit
drives in Bell with winning run in San Francisco's 2-1 victory over
St. Louis.</DH>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Giants have just won the National
League championship series. How are they going to celebrate?</LD>
<LD>   They're going to Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   Not to ride the Matterhorn, not to go on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, but
to continue their own wild-card ride into the World Series, an
All-California series against the Angels, also a wild card, beginning
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The Giants clinched the berth Monday night with a 2-1 victory over
the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 before a Pacific Bell Park crowd of
42,673. Kenny Lofton singled home David Bell from second base with
two out in the ninth inning to start the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Fireworks erupted over San Francisco Bay, Tony Bennett's ageless
rendition of "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" blared over the
public-address system, boats and cars blared their horns in a joyous
chorus and the scoreboard flashed those words first made famous half
a century ago by Russ Hodges: "The Giants win the pennant! The Giants
win the pennant!"</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, in the wake of another Giant triumph, Manager
Dusty Baker threw out the first challenge of a new rivalry by
altering an old battle cry .</TE>
<TE>   "Beat L.A.," he said, "Southern L.A. It's Orange County, but let's
beat L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Postgame victory parties almost always take place in clubhouses,
but this one was too big to be contained by four walls. Players and
fans refused to leave the field, the players bringing their bottles
of champagne out into the sparkling, unseasonably warm San Francisco
night to spray the fans and each other.</TE>
<TE>   Giant pitcher Livan Hernandez led a victory tour around the
warning track, players slapping hands with fans who leaned over the
railing to offer their congratulations to the new National League
champs.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of it was Barry Bonds, whose record 73 homers last
season and league-best .370 batting average this season never seemed
quite enough to offset the fact that he had never been on a team that
had won a postseason series.</TE>
<TE>   "I've finally gotten to the World Series," he said, "but I haven't
won it yet."</TE>
<TE>   He has been such a dominant player, the Giants have been referred
to as Barry Bonds and the seven dwarfs, but the spotlight also shined
on catcher Benito Santiago -- who was named most valuable player of
the series after hitting .300 with two home runs and six RBIs -- and
Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton has been at the center of this series from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   When reliever Mike Crudale threw a pitch Lofton deemed too inside
in Game 1, he created a near brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton hadn't done anything since, going 0 for 17 since Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   And it appeared as if he might be the goat of Game 5 when St.
Louis catcher Mike Matheny, batting in the seventh inning of a
scoreless tie, hit a fly ball into right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton caught up to the ball, but it glanced off his glove,
allowing Matheny to reach second.</TE>
<TE>   The official scorer charitably called it a double, but it appeared
it would be the key play of the game when Matheny scored.</TE>
<TE>   He reached third base when Giant reliever Felix Rodriguez picked
up Matt Morris' sacrifice-bunt attempt and fired too late to third,
trying to get Matheny.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vina then hit a sacrifice fly to left to put the
Cardinals in front, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Morris had a perfect game for three innings before hitting Lofton
to lead off the fourth. Morris had a no-hitter until Bell's two-out
single in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   And he still had a two-hit shutout heading into the eighth. With
one out in the eighth, Morris gave up back-to-back singles to Lofton
and Rich Aurilia, then hit Jeff Kent in the back.</TE>
<TE>   That was Morris' third hit batter of the game and now he was
staring at Bonds with the bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Relief time?</TE>
<TE>   La Russa stuck with Morris and he got Bonds on a fly ball deep
enough to get Lofton home with the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, Morris came to bat. His depth limited
with third baseman Scott Rolen injured, and looking at possible extra
innings, La Russa allowed Morris to bat.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out.</TE>
<TE>   With the score still tied in the bottom of the ninth, the first
two hitters were retired by Morris.</TE>
<TE>   But then he surrendered singles to Bell and Shawon Dunston,
putting runners at first and second.</TE>
<TE>   Finally out, came La Russa with his hook.</TE>
<TE>   In came reliever Steve Kline.</TE>
<TE>   His first pitch to Lofton was lined into right for a base hit.
Bell, all gears grinding, rounded third and steamed for home.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Drew picked up the ball in right field and let loose with an
off-line throw, although it would have taken a cannon shot to beat
Bell.</TE>
<TE>   As Matheny fielded the ball up the first-base line, Bell slid
across the plate face first.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds led the celebratory charge out of the dugout, followed by
the seven dwarfs.</TE>
<TE>   They were all going to the land of Snow White.</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--Mike Scioscia as a manager?</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said the thought never crossed
his mind when the two were wearing Dodger blue together.</LD>
<LD>   "He probably never thought about me being a manager," Baker said
of the man who has managed the Angels into the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "At that time, we were just trying to play. You don't think about
managing while you're playing, especially when you're an everyday,
regular player."</TE>
<TE>   But, Baker said, he's not surprised Scioscia wound up at the helm
of a big league club, considering how receptive he was to soaking up
knowledge of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when [Scioscia] first came up, his mentor was Roy
Campanella," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   "Campanella would come by his locker every day in his wheelchair,
whether [Scioscia] did something right or wrong, and would have
somebody help demonstrate how to block the ball, how to block the
plate, what he should have called in this situation or that
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I liked having those guys, veteran players, around,"
Baker added. "They can put your players on an accelerated learning
curve and thought process."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There has been tension between the Cardinals and abusive fans at
Pacific Bell Park during the National League championship series,
tension that drove some Cardinal relatives from their seats, tension
that brought pitcher Garrett Stephenson off the team bus and jaw to
jaw with a fan after Sunday night's game. "It definitely is not
typical of the way Giant fans have treated us," St. Louis Manager
Tony La Russa said, "but there have been some real brutal cases in
the stands. We've had a couple of our wives actually leave the
ballpark and go back to the hotel because of the insults and
profanity. It's been rough at times, but it's just the exception."</TE>
<TE>   Players are always instructed to avoid confrontations but La Russa
said he was glad Stephenson stepped forward in this case.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a guy who had really, really gone over the edge," La
Russa said of the fan. "So I'm very pleased that Garrett told him to
give it a rest [for the sake] of the ladies on the bus, told him he
should shut his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For each of three NLCS games played at home, the Giants gave a
former star the honor of throwing out the first pitch. Pitcher Dave
Dravecky got Game 3, pitcher Roger Craig Game 4 and outfielder Bobby
Bonds, Barry's father, Game 5.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There will be another John Wooden Award.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the honor that recognizes college basketball's player
of the year, this one will encompass not only Wooden's success as a
coach, but also the contributions that his late wife, Nell, made in
his development on the path to 10 national championships at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   The World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame announced the creation
of the new award -- the Nell and John Wooden Humanitarian Award for
Lifetime Coaching Achievement -- and will honor Wooden as the first
recipient Nov. 6 at Boise State in Idaho.</LD>
<TE>   Future honorees will be selected from any sport at the high
school, college or professional level and be judged on, among other
things, longevity and success, community work and the impact of
player/coach relationships.</TE>

<HD>Now the Timing Is Right for Mauch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene Mauch gets right to the point.</LD>
<LD>   Whether you agree with how he managed the 1982 Angels and the 1986
Angels, whether you think he was an idiot or a genius for how he
handled the pitchers late in that 1986 Game 5 against the Red Sox,
the thing about Mauch is, he knows baseball.</LD>
<LD>   He knows the nuts and bolts ... and much more. He knows about
heart and head, about emotions, good and bad. A manager should be
measured by more than wins and losses, by more than how he used his
pitchers, or how he played the late innings.</LD>
<TE>   A manager should be measured by his heart, loyalty and devotion.</TE>
<TE>   So here's another thing about Mauch. He loves the Angels. He loves
them dearly. He watches all their games on his satellite dish at
home, near the second green of a beautiful golf course at Rancho
Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to win one for the Cowboy more than anybody except his
family and at least as much as anybody in his family," Mauch says.
"Maybe I wanted to win for the Cowboy too much. So am I happy right
now? Damn right I am."</TE>
<TE>   A day after the Angels clinched their first World Series
appearance, Mauch is saying that, yes, he might like to attend a
World Series game at Edison Field this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Autry, widow of Gene Autry, the Cowboy, had invited Mauch
to the ballpark twice during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have come Sunday," Mauch says, "and I could have come the
Friday when the Yankees were in town.</TE>
<TE>   "But I said no. I didn't want anybody to look at me and see
anything that might be mindful of tough times. I didn't want anybody
looking at me if things went badly and thinking I brought bad luck.
So I stayed at home, in front of the TV, and pulled like hell.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's all over, that stuff. Would I come back now? Yes, I
think I would. Can't come Saturday because my wife's [dog] needs
cataract surgery and I need to be here for them. But Sunday? I'd come
Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Mauch could have heard his 1986 managing
moves still being dissected on sports-talk radio, 16 years later.
Next month, Mauch will turn 77.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be par plus five," Mauch says, giving a little test of
sports knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   That's 72 plus five, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes it is," he says. "Good."</TE>
<TE>   At his age, and with his history, of being known more for the
games he lost -- with the Phillies in 1964, with the Angels in 1982
and 1986 -- than for getting flawed teams so far, Mauch is a man who
understands criticism and accepts it. It's not as if he wanted to
avoid anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard it all," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, Mauch says, it's not appropriate to talk about
Angel failures.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anything negative in print," he says. "I don't want
these players to know how to spell the word 'negative.' So let's talk
about the good."</TE>
<TE>   The good is Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Mauch says he told his wife, Jodie, in the spring that Scioscia
was a special man who had a special touch.</TE>
<TE>   "They've always said about this game that you can't get too high
or too low," Mauch says. "I mastered the high part, but I could never
master not getting low. I couldn't get over the bad losses. I've
always known that wasn't one of my strong points, coming right back
after a tough loss. I never wanted players to see my eyes after a
tough loss because I know they could see how hurt I was. Because I
did hurt, very badly. And the players could see it in my eyes, just
how much I hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike does some things I wish I had understood better. He has an
ability to get over things. This team had some sickening losses this
year, just sickening. And Mike was able to get this team to move on."</TE>
<TE>   And as Mauch watched the Angels skip away from the worst start in
team history -- "another negative and we're not talking about those,"
Mauch says -- he noticed something about them. It wasn't about the
bullpen or the bench or how Scott Spiezio was becoming a fine hitting
and fielding first baseman or how Darin Erstad was playing with joy
again or how Tim Salmon was playing without pain or how Garret
Anderson was playing with inherent confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "What I really like about this team is that this team has the
greatest kind of pride a team could have," Mauch says. "Pride in each
other. It's not an individual pride. It's how they look left and look
right and like what they see, and they look behind them and see a
manager who's been very fair and very consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Mauch finds joy in not noticing egos and not hearing complaining.
"They trust each other and their manager," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If you see Mauch at Edison Field during the World Series, don't
ask him if he believes in baseball curses or if he feels somehow
liberated now that the Angels will have a World Series on the resume.</TE>
<TE>   No longer will the touchstone of this franchise be "one out away,
one strike away." It won't be about Donnie Moore pitching to Dave
Henderson. It will be the legend of Adam Kennedy and his three
unlikely home runs, a 10-run inning and an undersized shortstop
making the final catch.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, no, I don't believe in curses," Mauch says. "I believe in a
good bullpen. A good bullpen is what gets you through the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "And the first time someone asked whether I felt any relief now
that the Angels are in the World Series, I raised hell. Is that all
anybody thinks of the depths of my sincerity about my feelings for
the Angels? That all I cared about was what this meant for me? But
maybe that's a fair question. I feel elation, and it's for the team
and the players and the coaches. And I'll enjoy coming back."</TE>

<HD>For First Time, Lasorda Doesn't Have an Opinion</HD>

<LD>Tom Lasorda was in Edison Field over the weekend to watch the Angels,
I would imagine just in case the Big Guy in the Sky turns out to be
wearing red and waving a thunder stick.</LD>
<LD>   Lasorda said he's thrilled at the prospect of watching two of his
former players, Dusty Baker and Mike Scioscia, manage against each
other in the World Series, but refused to pick a winner.</LD>
<LD>   "Let me tell you something," said Lasorda, who begins almost every
sentence that way, making me wonder if that's how he opened his
proposal to his wife, Jo. "I got mad at Roger Craig for picking a
winner. I wouldn't speak to Roger Craig for the longest time because
we were teammates and I heard him say once he hoped Don Zimmer's team
[Cubs] beat us.</LD>
<TE>   "That's really terrible when you've played with a guy. I never
forgave him for that. As far as I was concerned, we were no longer
friends. I saw him in Boston when he was helping the Diamondbacks
this past year and he said, 'Hello,' and I said, 'Hi,' and that's the
first time I've spoken to him in 10 years. I don't ever want to be in
that position with Dusty or Scioscia."</TE>
<TE>   I guess getting the silent treatment from Lasorda is a bad thing,
but let me think about that for a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   There have been rumors for years that Baker wants nothing to do
with the Dodgers because Lasorda gave him a bum rap over something
better not mentioned. But Lasorda said, "Never, there's never been a
problem with Dusty. When the Giants were looking for a manager, the
owner brought me a list of five names, and I recommended Dusty for
the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the guy, and I can't tell you how much I hate the idea of
even going into the Giants' clubhouse, but whenever Dusty comes to
town I go down to the Giants' clubhouse and say hello."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT HAS been 14 years since the Dodgers won a playoff game, and for
some fans it remains galling that Scioscia, who will probably be
named manager of the year when postseason awards are announced, never
got the chance to direct the team he played for from 1980 to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be the manager of the Dodgers," Lasorda said. "I agree
with those people wholeheartedly who say he should have never left
the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "But certain people got him out of here. We've got a good manager
now in Jim Tracy, but if you turn back the clock, it should have been
Scioscia. He was ready. I told him to go to triple A for a year and
get ready, he did and he was ready.</TE>
<TE>   "But the people here didn't want him. It was [Kevin] Malone's
regime. The people here wanted all Dodger personnel out of here. I
heard some of them make statements: 'This is no longer a Dodger
thing; this is us.' I thought it was a disgrace, and wanted to know
what was going on when they let Scioscia go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS WE know now, if Scioscia makes a miscalculation, like throwing
upstart Francisco Rodriguez in the biggest game of his life four
games in a row, it's no big deal because the Rally Monkey is going to
be there to pick him up.</TE>
<TE>   So I got to thinking what if Lasorda had the benefit of the
Monkey's good will after allowing Tom Niedenfuer to pitch to Jack
Clark and the disastrous results that followed in the 1985 National
League championship series, and I've never heard such language from
anyone other than my mother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   In fact I had no idea it was possible to spit over the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you something," he said. "I got your Rally Monkey for
you.... "</TE>
<TE>   I reminded Lasorda that Tracy had a Rally Monkey and gave it to
his dog, the dog chewed it up and look what happened to the Dodgers
down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you telling me that monkey has got a lot of power," Lasorda
said, and I think he was choking, or the words were falling all over
themselves trying to get out of his mouth. "Give me a break. Now let
me tell you about Jack Clark.... "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A MONTH ago Lasorda went on a local radio station and blasted fans
for not showing the Angels more support. The 2002 Angels, he said,
are very much like the 1988 Dodgers, who came from nowhere to win it,
which is like coming from Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "What an exciting team," Lasorda said, and I don't think he was
talking about the Dodgers. "One of the most impressive things was
what Scioscia did with Tim Salmon this year. He stood by him when
Salmon looked bad earlier this year and everybody wanted him out of
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Had Salmon not played for a manager like Scioscia, you know,
maybe somebody like Roger Craig, he would never have regained his
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Lasorda apparently not only has the appetite of an elephant, but
the memory as well.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GAVE it one more try: Who is going to win?</TE>
<TE>   "Check it out," Lasorda said. "Pennants, playoffs and the World
Series are won and lost in the bullpen. That is a fact."</TE>
<TE>   So who has the best bullpen?</TE>
<TE>   "They both have outstanding closers," Lasorda said. "The extra
guys have done a tremendous job for Scioscia. I don't like Dusty's
middle men as much. And the Giants don't have anyone to compare to
that kid [Rodriguez]."</TE>
<TE>   Then according Lasorda's recipe for postseason success, the Angels
have a bullpen edge, which makes the Angels his choice to win it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I never said that," Lasorda snapped in the voice I remember so
well from that Dave Kingman tape recording.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying who has the better team."</TE>
<TE>   I guess I'll have to give him a call; I'll bet you Roger Craig
knows who Lasorda will be favoring.</TE>

<KH>Soccer DAILY REPORT</KH>
<HD>Heskey, Cole Are Outraged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emile Heskey and Ashley Cole, the two players for England who were
the target of racist taunts by fans of Slovakia on Saturday during a
qualifying game for the 2004 European Championship, hit back on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Something has got to be done, that's the worst [abuse] I've ever
had," Heskey told reporters in Southampton, where the English team is
preparing for Wednesday's qualifying game against Macedonia.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't just one section of the crowd, it was the whole
stadium. There were people next to our bench doing things as well,
and the police stood next to them and did nothing about it.</LD>
<TE>   "To have a whole stadium shouting and making those gestures, it's
frightening. In 2002, you'd think everyone's mind had changed, but
it's still the same."</TE>
<TE>   The racial abuse extended beyond the fans, Cole told the Guardian.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to pick up the ball a couple of times, even the
stretcher staff [on the sideline] were making monkey noises," he told
the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "It hardly ever happens in England anymore, but when I play in
Europe it still goes on. I try hard to block it out, but sometimes
it's not easy."</TE>
<TE>   European soccer's governing body, UEFA, is investigating the
incidents and Slovakia is likely to be punished. It could even be
ordered to play its home games in empty stadiums, a sanction UEFA has
recently imposed on clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Frantisek Laurinc, the president of the Slovakia's soccer
federation, apologized, saying the fans' behavior "by no means
represent the general public opinion" and adding that Slovakia "is
prepared to cooperate actively in investigating the case."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Slovakia's ambassador to London has written to Heskey
and Cole to apologize for the abuse they suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Cardozo Controversy</TE>
<TE>   Jose Cardozo, who has scored a league-high 17 goals in 12 games
for Club America in the Mexican league, withdrew from the Paraguay
team that will play Spain on Wednesday, citing an injury.</TE>
<TE>   The move sparked anger in Asuncion, where the Paraguay soccer
federation said it would complain to FIFA, pointing out that Cardozo
was perfectly fit Saturday night, when he scored three goals in a 5-1
Club America victory over Chiapas.</TE>
<TE>   No Ghosts for Italy</TE>
<TE>   With fans and the media calling for his resignation in the wake of
another lackluster result, a 1-1 Euro 2004 qualifying tie with
Yugoslavia in Naples, Italy's Coach Giovanni Trapattoni said he won't
be stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, you journalists would like to change the coach
every two months," he told Gazzetta dello Sport. "When I was 40, I
reacted to results differently. Now, I'm calm. I sleep at night. I
don't see ghosts."</TE>
<TE>   Molina Retires</TE>
<TE>   Jose Molina, the Deportivo la Coruna and Spanish national team
goalkeeper who won the league and cup double while with Atletico
Madrid in 1996, announced that he was giving up soccer indefinitely
after learning that he had testicular cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, 32, said he would return home to Valencia to begin
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Iran Aims High</TE>
<TE>   After winning the Asian Games title for the fourth time, Iran has
set its sights on becoming the region's predominant soccer power.</TE>
<TE>   "Our win will create more enthusiasm for the team and interest
will rise," said the team's Croatian coach, Branco Ivancovic.</TE>
<TE>   "The team's failure to reach the last World Cup [Iran lost to
Ireland in a playoff] was felt as a huge disappointment throughout
the country."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy to Quit</TE>
<TE>   Ireland's Coach Mick McCarthy said he would step down after Euro
2002 in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "I will have done eight years in the job and I think that's more
than enough," he told the Guardian.</TE>

<HD>Griffith Doesn't Reveal Pain of His Missed Kick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in welcome anonymity among the full house at Edison Field on
Sunday was a 22-year-old Orange County native carrying the weight of
Westwood on his shoulders.</LD>
<LD>   The minute the Angels defeated the Minnesota Twins, Chris Griffith
stopped applauding long enough to dial his mother's cell number and
leave a message: "We're in the World Series!"</LD>
<LD>   Yvette Griffith retrieved the message at the airport, where she
and her husband were waiting for a flight home to Reno.</LD>
<TE>   "I quietly said a little thank you prayer," Yvette said. "What a
wonderful distraction."</TE>
<TE>   And wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   It quickly became apparent to Yvette and Chris Griffith Sr. that
as hard as they might try, there was no forgetting their son's missed
field-goal attempt that might have cost UCLA a victory over Oregon on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Not for them, or for him.</TE>
<TE>   A man at the airport saw the UCLA cap Chris Sr. was wearing and
said, "Great game -- except for the end."</TE>
<TE>   "That was like a dagger in the heart," Yvette said.</TE>
<TE>   The man then saw the No. 14 stenciled on the cap and asked if
Chris Sr. knew the kicker.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm his dad," Chris Sr. replied.</TE>
<TE>   "You must be proud," the man said. "Your son was so mature in the
way he handled the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith's parents are feeling a disorienting array of emotions.
But, yes, pride is at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   They are proud of the way their son responded to the reporters
crowded at his locker, answering every question about not only the
missed 46-yard field goal attempt with 1:54 left, but the blocked PAT
kick that provided the margin of victory in the 31-30 loss.</TE>
<TE>   They are proud of the way he emerged from the locker room with his
head up and shared a plate of carnitas at a post-game tailgate party
with a large group of family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   And they are proud of the way he stoically accepted condolences
and quickly changed the subject, unwilling to burden those closest to
him with the intensely personal disappointment of missing a potential
game-winning kick against Oregon for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a tailgate after every game, win or lose, make the kick
or miss the kick," Griffith said. "I wasn't going to ruin it for
everyone else. I appreciate all the support but I didn't want to talk
a lot about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I can deal with it myself. I don't need them to try to feel my
pain too."</TE>
<TE>   The traits that please Griffith's parents also concern them. They
know that because he doesn't display anguish, it doesn't mean he
isn't feeling any.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping he doesn't develop an ulcer by internalizing this,"
Yvette said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith's measured reaction was the opposite of another kicker
whose miss was prominent Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Beitia was unable to talk to reporters and cried for hours
after his 43-yard attempt that would have enabled Florida State to
upset No. 1 Miami was wide left. The Florida State team chaplain said
Beitia was inconsolable.</TE>
<TE>   He cried in the locker room, cried in the trainer's room, cried as
his parents and police officers escorted him to the team bus.</TE>
<TE>   If Griffith shed a single tear, it was in private.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday night I was reflecting on it and I was glad I didn't act
inappropriately after the miss," he said. "It's one kick. I was one
for two in the game. I've kicked many balls like that one and many
have gone through."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, has been the UCLA kicker since winning the job
as a redshirt freshman walk-on. He has made 41 of 57 field goals and
ranks fourth among kickers on the all-time Bruin scoring list with
257 points.</TE>
<TE>   He was a stellar all-around athlete at Douglas High in Minden,
Nev., near South Lake Tahoe, where his family moved from Tustin when
he was an adolescent. He played quarterback and defensive back, and
also lettered in track and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Bruins, Griffith is hardly an ostracized kicker unable
to relate to regular football players. His roommate last year was
receiver Brian Poli-Dixon and he is one of the boys, often
socializing with the guys in the trenches.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt like he let the team down, he feels horrible, but he has
a lot of friends on this team," quarterback Cory Paus said. "We are
going to need him to make kicks the rest of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody can diminish the pain with words, though. Mistakes by most
players are swallowed up in a sea of plays mere moments apart. A
kicker must live with a miss until the next kick.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a kicker and that's your life, it's just the way it is,"
Paus said. "Quarterbacks go through similar things, but we have the
whole game to bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   USC kicker Ryan Killeen missed a PAT kick and two long field-goal
attempts in a 30-27 overtime loss to Washington State on Oct. 5. He
rebounded to make three field goals in a victory over California on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The key to bouncing back, he said, was to get on the field with
his teammates and start swinging his leg at footballs.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to put the game behind me, [but] it's always in the back
of your head," Killeen said. "Until practices started, it really
bothered me.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of players were saying we've got a new team to beat, so
don't let it bother you. The team was very supportive. If it wasn't
for them, I would have been a mess."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to tell how tough Griffith is on himself because he
reveals so little. Growing up in Tustin, he was coached by his
father. Chris Sr. was a deputy sheriff who regularly dealt with
crisis. But he didn't bring his work home with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He dealt with juvenile crimes and gang intervention, and many of
his days were incredibly rough," Yvette said. "In our house you talk
when you need to."</TE>
<TE>   Yvette, meanwhile, spent countless hours at home talking with
Chris and his younger brother, Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about everything and if there was a problem, he'd tell
me," she said. "I'm still in constant communication with Chris and
have invited him to share problems in his life.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't like to do that anymore. He's a lot like his dad, but
how strong can a 22-year-old be?"</TE>
<TE>   It is the nature of kickers to be introspective. The mechanics are
subtle, the fundamentals arcane. They tinker with their approach and
fiddle with their footwork.</TE>
<TE>   And they dream of the day the obsessive attention to detail and
numbing repetition of the same swing of the leg results in a
game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith doesn't verbalize much, but he whispers to his holder
before practice kicks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is to win the game, we have to make it," he says to Garrett
Lepisto.</TE>
<TE>   Those flights of fancy are usually followed by the flight of the
ball through the uprights. Griffith knocks them home from more than
55 yards in practice.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't had many opportunities to make pivotal kicks in games.
He beat Washington in overtime with a 22-yarder as a freshman. His
longest field goal came last season against Ohio State, a 49-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   And his first devastating miss came last season against Oregon, a
50-yard attempt on the last play of a 21-20 Bruin loss. He made his
next try, against Arizona State in the season finale.</TE>
<TE>   This season, he started slowly, missing two attempts against
Colorado State. He missed another the next week, but then came on,
making six of seven. Against Oregon, he made one from 37 yards in the
third quarter and trotted on the field for the potential winning kick
brimming with confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit it hard," he said. "I didn't hit it straight but I thought
it might be good. Then I looked up and watched it sail wide."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Griffith faced reporters again, answering hard
questions with straight answers. At the end he politely made clear
what his parents and friends discovered over the weekend -- he really
didn't want to discuss it again.</TE>
<TE>   "We have six games left and maybe a bowl game," he said. "I have
to be part of that. I can't be thinking about missed kicks."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The protection on the blocked extra-point attempt in the third
quarter of UCLA's 31-30 loss to Oregon was not as airtight as linemen
claimed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A review of the film indicated that Duck defender Haloti Ngata
pushed into the Bruin backfield before raising his arms and tipping
the ball with his fingers.</LD>
<LD>   "Their big guy knocked our guard back," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo
said. "And it was a low kick."</LD>
<TE>   Kicker Chris Griffith, who had made 80 PAT kicks in a row before
the block, believes the trajectory of the kick was fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably 40 of those 80 I made were the same trajectory as that
one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said another problem was that holder Garrett Lepisto set
the ball down seven yards behind the line of scrimmage, half a yard
closer than normal.</TE>
<TE>   The coach made certain that none of the Bruins blamed Griffith,
Lepisto or Eyoseph Efseaff, the guard assigned to block Ngata. At a
team meeting Monday, Toledo said that anybody who made a mistake in
the game should stand up.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be standing too," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, is in no danger of losing his job.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Kluwe, a redshirt sophomore, is considered a punter,
although he kicked a 60-yard field goal for Los Alamitos High.
Freshman Justin Medlock, who is redshirting, is considered the kicker
of the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Kluwe is not in their category," Toledo said. "He has a strong
leg but kicks line drives. But he's going to be an excellent punter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The defensive backfield could become a concern later this week.
Cornerbacks Matt Ware and Joe Hunter did not practice, joining safety
Ben Emanuel on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Ware has tightness in his back and said he will practice today.
Hunter has flu.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel, who did not play against Oregon because of a pinched
nerve in his neck, is questionable. The sophomore experienced
numbness in his arm last week but said that the feeling has returned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jibril Raymo started in place of Emanuel and played
well, making eight tackles and forcing a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt aggressive and fast out there," he said. "I had some

<HD>Allmond Is Finally Back in Mix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC cornerback Marcell Allmond was struck by a car before training
camp, practiced for two days and then endured a one-week hospital
stay because of a staph infection and played in a few games as a
reserve despite a fractured right wrist.</LD>
<LD>   Allmond's effort, and his physical style of play, apparently will
be rewarded.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the 6-foot junior worked with the first unit at left
cornerback in place of redshirt freshman William Buchanon.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to work my butt off to stay there," said Allmond, who
made four tackles and broke up a pass in USC's 30-28 victory over
California last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time for him to do some playing," Coach Pete Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon started three consecutive games after replacing injured
Ronald Nunn in the second quarter against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond hopes to help the Trojan secondary neutralize Washington
wide receiver Reggie Williams, a 6-4, 220-pound sophomore, who has
caught 38 passes and is averaging 17.2 yards a catch.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the opportunity I've been shooting for," Allmond said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Shaun Cody and offensive tackle Jacob Rogers will
not play against Washington because of knee injuries suffered against
Cal. Both will learn results of MRI exams today.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Cody's injury is thought to be more serious than
Rogers'.</TE>
<TE>   "It was real scary when I got hurt because I never had an injury
like this," said Cody, who was on crutches Monday. "It swelled a
little bit, but it's feeling a little better."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bernard Riley replaced Cody and played a season-high 30
plays against Cal. Riley will start against Washington with freshman
LaJuan Ramsey and senior Anthony Daye backing him up.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers re-injured his right knee, which he sprained against Oregon
State.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Eric Torres, who replaced Rogers against Cal, will start at
left tackle against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach likes to call me 'Utility Guy,' so whatever they need is
fine with me," said Torres, who also started games at right tackle
and right guard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly did not practice and wore a knee-high
plastic protective boot to support a sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said he was hurt on the Trojans' second play against Cal
when he battled Golden Bear defensive back James Bethea for a long
pass that fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to take myself out and I wasn't going to tell
anyone I was hurt," said Kelly, who caught three passes for 19 yards
and scored on a controversial six-yard touchdown. "I just went out
there and did my best."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said he will probably miss some practice but will play
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu took part in some light drills but said he
remains day to day because of a high right ankle sprain. "It's
frustrating," Polamalu said. "We'll just have to wait and see how it
goes." ... Carroll said freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua might
take part in drills next week. Matua injured his right knee a few
days before the opener against Auburn and had arthroscopic surgery on
Oct. 3. That day, Carroll said Matua was on track to become a
redshirt.... USC's game at Oregon on Oct. 26 will begin at 12:30 p.m.
and will be televised by ABC.</TE>

<HD>Australian Team Tries to Regroup</HD>
<DH>Amateur football players won't leave Bali without locating
seven missing teammates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>It was their first day in paradise. They had just flown in, shared a
dinner of steaks and sweet and sour chicken, and looked forward to
hosting a pool party later that night.</LD>
<LD>   But first, the plumbers, fishermen and other amateurs who play
Australian-rules football as members of the Kingsley Cats hit a
popular local bar. Hundreds of other Aussie tourists had packed the
place, drinking and dancing to Top 40 music.</LD>
<LD>   The team had just won a tournament back home in the state of
Western Australia, and this was a great place to celebrate.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday night turned out to be the last time the 20 members of
the Cats were all together. Seven players remain unaccounted for
after a car bomb ripped through the Sari disco club on Bali, killing
at least 188 people and wounding many more.</TE>
<TE>   The victims come from 25 countries. But Australians appear to have
suffered by far the largest number of casualties. Fifteen have been
confirmed dead and 220 are among the missing, the Australian
government has said.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion still reigned Monday as workers dug out and identified
bodies. Team members said that while they searched for missing
teammates at area hospitals, they saw the name of one of their
buddies on the list of the dead. But he was standing right next to
them.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, might prove to be a lucky exception.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expectation is that the number of Australian deaths will be
very high," said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the blast, surviving members of the team replay
events in their minds, worry about their missing teammates and come
to terms with the fact that no one can be sure of escaping the reach
of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "You had your twin towers, that was your financial center," team
member Kalan Zomer, 20, said of New York's World Trade Center. "We
have Bali. It's Australia's No. 1 international destination."</TE>
<TE>   Team members, who hail from near Perth, had worked for a year to
organize and raise money for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be a holiday," said Zomer, who is a plumber by
day. "Now it's a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   One team member who loved to take pictures forgot his camera and
had just left the club to get it when the blast occurred. He is
missing.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Phillips, 30, said his 19-year-old teammate Brad McIlroy had
just met a girl he liked.</TE>
<TE>   "He was sitting beside her, had his arms around her," Phillips
said. "After the blast, he looked at her and she was dead." McIlroy
survived.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, a home appliance salesman, said he had been dancing with
three other women. None of them made it, either. The blast threw him
20 yards and set fire to the roof, which started to cave in. He and
teammate Duane Pearce, a 28-year-old lobsterman, said they were saved
by a wall of milk crates that were stacked up like stairs, which they
used to scramble out.</TE>
<TE>   The lucky ones climbed to the roof and ran along a wooden beam
that was only about 2 inches thick. People clung to electrical wires
for balance.</TE>
<TE>   "One person in front of me jumped off the roof," Phillips said.
"He probably broke his neck. I saw him land on his back, and his neck
just kind of twisted."</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Ben Clohessy said the blast covered him with debris and
temporarily pinned his hands. He was sure he was going to die.</TE>
<TE>   Freed from the debris, Clohessy said, he had to scale a
10-foot-high wall. "You just find the energy to do it when you know
you are about to die," he said. But he first lifted a younger
teammate to safety.</TE>
<TE>   "My shirt was on fire. I had to take everything off as fast as I
could," said Adam Nimmo, 20, who was in shock and disoriented when
Clohessy helped him. Burn marks now run down Nimmo's arm. He has
bandages on his toe and knee, and wounds all over his back.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they are amateurs, the football players said they
thought their fast reactions and overall fitness helped many of them
survive. Many of the women in the club had a much harder time scaling
the walls.</TE>
<TE>   "We were out quick as a flash," coach Simon Quayle said. "Any more
time than that, we would have been gone." He said team members picked
up some of the women and hoisted them over the walls.</TE>
<TE>   After they had trickled back to the hotel, team members said they
just broke down. They all slept outside around the pool because no
one wanted to go back to his room alone.</TE>
<TE>   Now the smallest noises make them jittery. The thump of a
refrigerator door closing. The clunk of a suitcase hitting the
stairs. They all sounded like a smaller explosion that preceded the
big explosion that turned the Sari Club into an inferno.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes, however, are quick to praise the kindness of many
local people who gave rides to the injured on their mopeds and even
took some home to care for them.</TE>
<TE>   But Clohessy, who remains deaf in one ear from the blast, said he
is uncomfortable having anyone look at him on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just difficult to tell if people are staring at us because
they are surprised we're alive, or if they want to get us because we
are still alive," he said. "We are petrified."</TE>
<TE>   If this is the work of Muslim extremists, the men are certain they
were targeted because of their nationality. Many Australian athletes
head to Bali for postseason celebrations in October, as the Cats did.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a message to Australians," Zomer said. "We follow
the Americans. We're just as bad in their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people say Bali is part of Australia," Zomer said. "You
see 10 people walking down the street, and eight or nine of them
would be Australians."</TE>
<TE>   Now they are fleeing in droves. The government has already sent
three charter flights to bring them home.</TE>
<TE>   But the team is not ready to leave. They came as one, and they say
they are going to leave as one.</TE>
<TE>   "We planned on staying seven days," Phillips said. "We'll stay as
long as it takes to find out where our friends are."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter arrived in
Jamaica to monitor national elections and said he believed the
Caribbean nation could hold a safe vote despite recent campaign
violence.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, who leads a delegation of about 60 foreign observers for
the elections Wednesday, said he believed Jamaica's political leaders
understood that their nation's ability to hold safe elections would
play a big role in its economic prosperity. Jamaica, with a
population of 2.7 million, has one of the world's highest murder
rates, with an average of three killings a day last year -- violence
that many analysts blame for sagging tourism and an economy that has
barely grown in a decade.</LD>

region of Ivory Coast, unsettling world markets for the product. West
African mediators pushed for a truce to end the nearly monthlong
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds have died in the fighting. The war and the ethnic
violence it is unleashing have caused tens of thousands of people to

<HD>Violent Death Hits Clan Again</HD>
<DH>A Palestinian gunman killed when a phone blows up becomes
the latest member of family to perish, many in clashes with Israelis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The graveyard of the Abeiyat clan, carved from a raw and wind-swept
West Bank hilltop, is filling up fast, and the latest arrival was in
line with what has become a grim family tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Abeiyat, a 28-year-old unemployed laborer and part-time
gunman, was blown apart by a booby-trapped public telephone in what
nearly everyone in this dusty West Bank city believes was an attack
carried out -- perhaps in error -- by Israel. Israeli authorities
have refused to comment on the case.</LD>
<LD>   A brother of the slain man, 26-year-old Moussa Abeiyat, said he
was driving toward the hospital where Mohammed had dropped off their
ailing mother shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday when, from only yards away,
he saw a burst of blue-and-orange flame from the pay phone where
Mohammed was standing. A shower of metal shrapnel rained against the
car.</LD>
<TE>   Another relative, Ismail Abeiyat, arrived at the scene a few
moments later to see Mohammed lying bloodied on the ground, his
entrails spilling out, the hand that had been holding the telephone
blown cleanly off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as if he had been cut in pieces with a saw," Ismail
Abeiyat said Monday at the makeshift funeral tent where men of the
clan -- some of them grizzled elders bent over their canes, others
young and hard-eyed, with pistols tucked into their belts -- sat in
quiet rows, sipping bitter dark coffee and hand-rolling cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of Mohammed Abeiyat's death--involving the
precision application of high-tech weaponry, by remote means and with
gruesome results--eerily echo those of two of his kinsmen in the last
23 months.</TE>
<TE>   The Abeiyats are a large and well-known clan in and around
Bethlehem, almost as famous for their colorful nomadic roots as for
the deep involvement of many family members in the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a Palestinian militia whose attacks have killed scores of
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis have hit back at the clan, and hard. Hussein Abeiyat,
a senior leader of the then-nascent militia, was killed by an Israeli
helicopter-fired rocket that slammed into his vehicle on a Bethlehem
back road Nov. 9, 2000, in the early days of the more than 2-year-old
Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   His death marked the first in a string of "targeted killings" of
Palestinian figures suspected of having or proven to have planned or
carried out attacks against Israelis. The practice is denounced by
human rights groups and Palestinians but defended by Israel as a
necessary and lifesaving tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, cousin Atef Abeiyat, who had moved into a leadership
position in the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade after Hussein Abeiyat's
death, was killed when an explosion shattered the vehicle in which he
was riding. The operation was also widely believed to have been
carried out by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, the Abeiyat family has been at the center of other
key dramas in Bethlehem, where the clan settled several generations
ago after countless years of nomadic herding of sheep and goats in
the surrounding hills.</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen Abeiyats were inside Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity, the traditional site of Jesus' birth, during the 39-day
Israeli-Palestinian standoff last spring. One of them, 28-year-old
Nidal Abeiyat, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper when he stepped
into the church courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Four others from the family, all wanted by Israel, were sent into
exile overseas as part of the deal that ended the standoff, and
another four were banished to the Gaza Strip, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   By the clan's count, about 15 members have died in clashes with
the Israelis over the course of the current uprising, and dozens have
been jailed or wounded, they said.</TE>
<TE>   But the death of Mohammed Abeiyat, buried Monday after a funeral
that drew thousands of mourners, left many here convinced that this
time, the violent passing of yet another of the family's sons had
been a case of mistaken identity.</TE>
<TE>   Although crude fliers posted throughout Bethlehem showed a
black-and-white photo of Abeiyat posing in combat fatigues, crouching
as he cradled an M-16 rifle, he was described by associates as a
low-level player whose activities were confined to occasional
shooting in the direction of the nearby Israeli neighborhood of Gilo.
Throughout the conflict, those targeted for assassination by the
Israelis have been far more senior figures in militant groups such as
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.</TE>
<TE>   By late Monday, Israeli television was citing unidentified
military sources as saying that the killing had been the result of a
blunder and that investigations were being launched by both the
Israeli army and the Shin Bet domestic intelligence service as to how
the wrong man came to be blown up.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian sources said the intended target might have been a
senior leader of the Islamic Jihad group who had been frequenting the
hospital in the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Jala where Abeiyat had
dropped off his mother just before he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Although furious over the killing, clan members said they would
not seek revenge against Israel for fear of prompting a military
reoccupation of Bethlehem, which has enjoyed relative quiet over the
last two months. But as is often the case, violence threatened to
spill inward, toward other Palestinians. A scuffle broke out at the
funeral, and a Palestinian journalist who had written an article
perceived to have been critical of the clan was beaten and
hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Family elders said that if any Palestinian was found to have
helped Israel plan the attack that killed Abeiyat, they would hand
him over to police. But revenge is ingrained in clan culture; in
March, two men who had been implicated in collaborating in the
killings of Hussein and Atef Abeiyat were dragged from their jail
cells and shot dead. The killers then briefly hung one of the bodies
in Manger Square, in front of the Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   At the clan's cemetery, caretaker Mahmoud Abeiyat said he did not
expect that his kinsman Mohammed would be the last of the family's
sons he would bury.</TE>
<TE>   "We must accept what God decrees for us," he said.</TE>

<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany</DL>
<LD>A law student arrested for kidnapping and killing the 11-year-old son
of a prominent banker confessed Monday, the man's defense attorney
and a prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   Magnus Gaefgen made a "full and comprehensive" confession during
questioning by investigators, said defense attorney Hans-Ulrich
Endres.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Jakob von Metzler was found outside Frankfurt on Oct.
1, after Gaefgen gave officials the location. He was arrested Sept.
30 after Jakob was not released despite payment of a $990,000 ransom.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators have gathered clues from the lake 40 miles northeast
of Frankfurt where the boy's body was recovered and from the forest
where authorities said they observed Gaefgen picking up the ransom
paid by the boy's father, private banker Friedrich von Metzler.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Rainer Schilling said Monday that Gaefgen had described
the crime from the planning stage to the disposal of the body, and he
said the 27-year-old faced more questioning today.</TE>

<HD>Britain Takes Back Reins of N. Ireland</HD>
<DH>London's minister for province says a recent political
espionage scandal has undermined trust, and warns IRA to end militant
activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The people of Northern Ireland awoke today to find themselves under
London's rule again, their four-year attempt at power-sharing between
sectarian communities suspended because Britain says continuing Roman
Catholic paramilitary activity has "eroded trust" among Protestants.</LD>
<LD>   And John Reid, the British Cabinet minister responsible for the
province, warned that Protestant faith in the political institutions
at the core of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement will not be
revived until the Irish Republican Army and its political wing, Sinn
Fein, "take a definitive decision ... which gets rid of any notion
they may be following a dual track of politics and violence."</LD>
<LD>   Reid's words are an understood code for demands that the IRA
declare its war with the British state over and its volunteers ready
to disband. The decision to suspend the Northern Ireland Assembly and
executive council comes amid new evidence that the IRA remains
visibly operational, Reid said in an interview with The Times on
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The sense of crisis accelerated after the province's police force
raided Sinn Fein offices at Stormont, seat of the assembly, on Oct. 4
to crack what it claims was an IRA espionage ring. Three republican
activists were later arrested and charged with stealing British
government mail and memorandums.</TE>
<TE>   The raid spooked Protestant unionists already uneasy over the
high-profile trial in Colombia of three alleged IRA members charged
with aiding that country's guerrilla movement. The IRA was also
alleged to have carried out the theft in March from a police station
in Belfast, the province's capital, of names and addresses of state
security officers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the republican paramilitary group is no longer bombing
and murdering at the terrifying rates of the 30-year "Troubles," the
latest suggestion that its activists were involved in political
espionage "at the heart of government," as unionists put it, was too
serious an affront.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have to be completely naive to think that a continual
drip-feed of charges and allegations of this nature doesn't instantly
undermine confidence with people's partners in power-sharing," Reid
said from Belfast.</TE>
<TE>   Some unionists are also dead set against sharing power, he noted.
"But the difficulty is that those enlightened sections of unionism
who took the chance, who said, 'Yes we believe the republican
movement will commit themselves to politics,' are confronted almost
continually now with charges that this hasn't happened.</TE>
<TE>   "And they need reassurance."</TE>
<TE>   Reid's solution is a well-worn tactic. The British government has
suspended Northern Ireland's government three times since the Good
Friday deal was signed, all in the name of buying the parties some
political breathing space and cooling tempers.</TE>
<TE>   But suspension has never lasted longer than three months, and
almost all observers are predicting a more protracted pause this
time. One sign was Reid's announcement that he was increasing the
number of ministers responsible for running the province's affairs
from three to five, anticipating an extended period of London
administration.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Reid was promoting
himself as a "referee" in the conflict when actually "we are in this
situation because once again unionists threaten the institutions and
Reid moved to accommodate them."</TE>
<TE>   But privately, some republicans acknowledge that they have not
successfully corralled elements that are reluctant to wind down the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that the war is over -- though we haven't said that -- what
do people do with themselves?" said one former IRA gunrunner who is
close to Adams. "People have been in this life for 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   There is little expectation among unionists that, faced with
Reid's demand for an end to violence, the IRA will swiftly comply and
declare its war over.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful not to set the barrier to restarting
power-sharing so high it can't be cleared," said David Ervine, leader
of the Progressive Unionist Party, one of the smaller unionist
parties with links to Protestant paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an absolute lust among ordinary people for a change in
paramilitary attitudes -- on both sides," he said. "We are an
abnormal, immoral society, so calling for morality in our
paramilitaries is a bit of a joke. But the question is: Are
paramilitaries prepared to speed up their metamorphosis from violence
to politics? And I think that though there may be some dark days
ahead, we'll get there."</TE>

<HD>Islamic Parties Want U.S. to Leave</HD>
<DH>Hard-line alliance that made gains in Pakistani election
criticizes presence of troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Hard-line Islamic parties, which have emerged as potential coalition
partners after a general election in Pakistan, said Monday that they
would seek to impose Islamic law in the country and ask U.S. troops
to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Talks over who would form a coalition in parliament proceeded,
with the focus of the outside world on whether the Islamic front,
which recorded sizable gains in Thursday's election, would be part of
the government or in opposition.</LD>
<LD>   The election, designed to return Pakistan to civilian rule after a
coup in 1999, has been strongly criticized by European Union
observers who said the military tipped the voting in its favor to
allow President Pervez Musharraf to hold on to power.</LD>
<TE>   "We assure the international community that we are not
terrorists," said Qazi Hussain Ahmed, leader of Pakistan's largest
religious-based political party, Jamaat-i-Islami, which is part of
the United Council of Action, a coalition of six Islamic parties. He
added: "But we do not approve of foreign interference. For this we do
not need any help from the American forces nor their bases in the
country. There should also be no such bases here which could be used
for interference in the affairs of neighboring states."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the small U.S. military presence in Pakistan
concentrated at the Jacobabad air base, from which search-and-rescue
operations in Afghanistan are launched. Other party leaders called
for imposing Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, a key ally of Washington in its campaign against
Afghanistan's former ruling Taliban movement and Al Qaeda, said the
rise of the religious parties would not derail his policies.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as national policies are concerned ... the national
strategy does not change with a change of government, it continues,"
he told reporters after a summit in Istanbul, Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   The allied Islamic parties won 50 seats. That makes them the
third-largest bloc behind the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, with 77
seats, and the Pakistan People's Party, which won 62.</TE>

<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica's party vowed to challenge the
annulment of the Serbian presidential elections, claiming Monday that
voter lists were inflated with the names of dead or nonexistent
people.</LD>
<LD>   The state electoral commission said Sunday's election will have to
be repeated because the turnout was 45.5%, falling short of the
required 50% minimum.</LD>
<LD>   Kostunica, a moderate nationalist, won 67% of the vote in Sunday's
election, more than twice as much as Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western
deputy prime minister and an ally of Kostunica's main rival, Serbian
Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, according to the official count.</LD>
<TE>   The commission said Serbs will have to vote again by Dec. 5, and
the new election will be open to all candidates, including
ultranationalist allies of former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who is now on trial for war crimes.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Drops Shark Fishing Plan</HD>
<DH>Ecologists and tourism promoters triumph over decree that
would have allowed commercial boats to operate as close to shore as
half a mile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux and Pete Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>In an unusually public battle over Mexico's extraordinary marine
wealth, ecologists and tourism promoters have forced the government
to scrap a new decree that would have allowed commercial shark
fishing as close as half a mile offshore.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise retreat, announced late Friday, gave
environmentalists a victory in one of their biggest causes here in
recent years. But it left largely unregulated an enterprise they say
is threatening Mexico's shark population and a host of marine species
that sustain the country's lucrative tourist industry.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico requires commercial shark vessels to stay at least 50 miles
from shore, but the rule is widely ignored. Opponents of the new
decree said it was quietly promoted by Mexican entrepreneurs with
ties to foreign fleet owners and would have legalized much of the
poaching.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute focused on Baja California and the adjacent
800-mile-long Sea of Cortes, home to more than 60 species of shark.
Javier Usabiaga, the minister of agriculture and fisheries, says he
favors more aggressive fishing there "to produce food for the hungry
people of Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   But ecologists say the mile-wide gill nets and 6-mile-long lines
dropped by shark boats are devastating one of the world's richest
collections of marlin, sailfish, dorado and other game fish
populations, as well as manta rays, dolphins, endangered sea turtles
and other non-game species.</TE>
<TE>   Usabiaga's ministry published the new decree July 12 after an
unpublicized debate. The stormy reaction embarrassed President
Vicente Fox, who was elected two years ago on a pledge to end the
secretive, authoritarian ways that characterized seven decades of
rule by his nemesis, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican leader, who championed the cause of "sustainable
development" at a U.N. environmental summit in South Africa last
month, never publicly endorsed the decree. Instead of putting it into
force Sept. 12 as scheduled, he suspended it and called for public
hearings on its possible revision.</TE>
<TE>   From that point, the protesters got the upper hand. Fox's
environment and tourism ministers lined up against the decree, as did
the federal Senate and state government of Baja California Sur, where
game fishing is a mainstay of the tourist industry. Hotel owners
there threatened a tax revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico has changed radically," Environment Minister Victor
Lichtinger said in an interview. "You cannot do things like they used
to, without the people really participating."</TE>
<TE>   A host of environmental activists registered their protests with
full-page ads in Mexican newspapers and a torrent of e-mails to Fox's
office. They vowed to disrupt a late-October meeting of more than 20
world leaders, including President Bush, at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum gathering in Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of the Baja
peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Sports fishermen weighed in from abroad. "If this [decree] is
passed, I will take all my fishing friends and their dollars to a
different country that is sensible and protects their sports fishing
stocks," Peter Langstraat threatened in an electronic protest from
the Netherlands. He said he and his group have been fishing in Baja
California for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a sharp exchange in the Senate last Tuesday, Veronica Velasco,
a senator and president of Mexico's Green Party, glared at Usabiaga
and demanded to know: "What private interests seek to benefit from
this action?"</TE>
<TE>   "Your servant does not respond to any private interests," Usabiaga
said, referring to himself in the third person. He went on to claim
that critics kept silent during the internal debate on the decree,
only to "create a scandal" after it was announced.</TE>
<TE>   But in an unexpected reversal, Usabiaga told Congress he was ready
to revoke the decree, "to take away, once and for all, the fear that
we're going to impose a rule at the cost of the country's
tranquillity." The decree was formally abolished with a brief notice
in Friday's official government bulletin.</TE>
<TE>   "These polemics show that when the people of Mexico become aware
of a problem, they are in favor of conservation," said Guillermo
Alvarez, president of the Mexican Billfish Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "But the debate is just beginning," he added. "The next step is to
control the illegal fishing that's going on" while the government
tries again to draft regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Villavicencio, a marine biologist in Baja California Sur,
says the number of shark fishing permits from the government has
grown from 57 in 1998 to 303 today and that during that time the
annual catch has dropped from 34,000 tons to 22,000 tons because of
overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   Jeronimo Ramos, the top fisheries official in Usabiaga's ministry,
insists that sharks are not endangered. In an interview, he argued
that the decree would have imposed enough regulation to sustain the
shark population near its current level.</TE>
<TE>   But ecologists and game fishing operators say their main concern
is the loss of close-to-shore species caught up in shark poachers'
long lines and gill nets, then thrown away or left to die. Fisheries
officials argue that such losses of "incidental fish" to shark boats
and shrimp trawlers are not serious.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, government prosecutors suggested otherwise.
Backed by the navy, they began expelling shrimp trawlers that were
fishing illegally in the federally protected Alto Golfo Biosphere
Reserve, in the northern part of the Sea of Cortes, also known as the
Gulf of California. On one boat, officials said, they confiscated 33
pounds of shrimp and 687 pounds of "incidental fish."</TE>

<HD>Bali Blast Signals Terrorist Shift</HD>
<DH>U.S. officials say Islamic militants, no longer content to
attack Western 'symbols of freedom,' are aiming at softer targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Meyer and Bob Drogin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The deadly weekend bombing in Bali signals a shift in targeting for a
global coalition of Muslim extremists that puts U.S. tourists at
higher risk of attack than ever before, U.S. officials and
counter-terrorism experts said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Indonesian and U.S. officials say they believe that Al Qaeda or
related organizations in Southeast Asia were responsible for the
bombing, which killed at least 188 people and injured hundreds more.
But so far, they have not released definitive evidence.</LD>
<LD>   They also said the bombing -- at least the timing of it --
possibly was inspired by an audiotape message last week from Ayman
Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's top aide, who spoke of targeting U.S. and
Western economic interests. The bombing killed people from at least
25 countries, including two Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Whoever ultimately is found responsible, U.S. officials said the
attack is the most emphatic indication to date that Islamic militants
are no longer content to focus on embassies, military installations
and other well-protected "symbols of freedom" across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   The attack also seemed intended to send shock waves through
pro-Western regimes. It was potentially devastating to Indonesian
President Megawati Sukarnoputri, according Daniel Benjamin, a Clinton
White House counter-terrorism expert and co-author of "The Sacred Age
of Terror."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a major source of embarrassment, and it will devastate the
[Indonesian] economy because it will ruin the tourist business for a
long time to come," Benjamin said.</TE>
<TE>   He said various recent attacks prove Al Qaeda's continued global
reach. "That's an important part of the message," he said. "They're
claiming a large portion of the globe as their area of operation."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are investigating a rash of recent attacks to see
whether they are related and whether they are the work of Al Qaeda
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, a French tanker exploded off the coast of Yemen under
suspicious circumstances; U.S. officials say they suspect that
terrorists rammed a boat into its hull and detonated explosives. Two
days later, one U.S. Marine was killed and another wounded during
exercises on an island off Kuwait; the attack was carried out by two
gunmen who authorities say have been linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the areas [where] you would normally expect attacks,"
said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But this
[Bali] attack is evidence that they are not limiting their scope of
attacks to them. Anywhere where our people go, or where we have
assets, are vulnerable. It shows that they have such disregard for
our culture and society that they will attack us wherever they can."</TE>
<TE>   After the Bali bombing, the State Department ordered all
nonessential U.S. Embassy employees in Jakarta and their families out
of Indonesia. In that advisory, it also warned of other, similar
attacks in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "As security is increased at official U.S. facilities, terrorists
and their sympathizers will seek softer targets," the advisory said.
"These may include facilities where Americans are generally known to
congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants, places of worship,
schools or outdoor recreation events."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Bali bombing, the State Department last week
issued a global travel alert.</TE>
<TE>   "It highlights what we have been saying, [that] terrorism is
worldwide and targeting Westerners," said a department official.
Authorities have feared just such an attack since Al Qaeda became a
global terrorist network in the 1990s, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been talking about these things for months and years," the
official said. He added that there is little the U.S. government can
do to protect its citizens traveling overseas.</TE>
<TE>   A taped message--professed to be from Bin Laden--was released last
week warning of future attacks. A letter purportedly written by the
Al Qaeda founder, who disappeared during the U.S. invasion of
Afghanistan, was publicized by an Arab satellite TV network Monday.
The letter praises the attacks on the U.S. Marines in Kuwait and the
explosion of the French tanker.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, who have said they do not know whether Bin Laden
is dead or alive, said they would scrutinize the letter to see
whether it is authentic and to try to determine whether it holds any
clues as to future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The heroic operation in Kuwait proves the level of danger that
threatens U.S. forces in Islamic countries," said the letter,
released by the Al Jazeera TV network. "The priority in this war, at
this stage, must be against the infidels, the Americans and the Jews,
who have not stopped their injustice."</TE>
<TE>   The Bali bombing has sent waves of concern through dozens of
nations that, like Indonesia, rely on tourism to keep their fragile
economies afloat, said Magnus Ranstorp, a counter-terrorism expert
who consults with European governments on Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Ranstorp and other experts said the attack might be a signal that
Al Qaeda and its followers are trying to undermine moderate
governments in Southeast Asia and elsewhere that have pledged to help
the U.S. counter-terrorism effort by targeting their tourism
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing about this is the targeting of an
economic infrastructure and its tourism industry," said Ranstorp,
director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political
Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. "It is an old
tactic that Islamic militants have undertaken over the years. But the
sheer scale of the attack is different, and it underscores foreign
involvement" by Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first attack in recent years on tourist
attractions. In 1997, an Egypt-based group killed 58 people in a
machine-gun attack at a tourist site in Luxor, Egypt. And Al Qaeda
itself plotted at least one other series of large-scale attacks on
the eve of the new millennium.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp. think tank in
Santa Monica, said it "probably doesn't matter" if Al Qaeda was
directly involved in the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The pattern we're seeing is that groups strongly affiliated with
Al Qaeda, who have received training from them, have cobbled together
their own local operations," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Resists Tying Iraq to New Terror Attacks</HD>
<DH>Australia may be more willing to send troops against
Hussein, but the Security Council continues its focus on language of
resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A renewed wave of terrorism in the Middle East and Asia seems
unlikely to harden sentiment against Saddam Hussein within the
Security Council as the United States struggles to win French and
Russian support for a tough resolution against Iraq, diplomats and
political observers said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   However, there were signs that recent attacks could make it
politically easier -- at least in one instance -- for a leader to
join the United States in an attack on Iraq. In Australia, where
public backing for joining a U.S.-led coalition against Hussein was
finely balanced, widespread outrage at the Bali bombing was expected
to swing the country behind Prime Minister John Howard's desire to
commit troops, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "It will dissolve some of the doubts people here have had about
supporting the U.S. [militarily] in Iraq," said Michael McKinley, a
specialist on war and diplomacy at the Australian National University
in Canberra. "There may not be evidence linking Saddam with Al Qaeda,
but the Bali attack is being presented as an attack against the
Australian people, so it's psychologically very powerful."</LD>
<TE>   A large number of the dead in the Bali explosion were Australians.</TE>
<TE>   Australia is believed to be offering a group of its elite Special
Air Service force -- units roughly equivalent to U.S. Special Forces
-- for possible deployment to Iraq. About 150 to 200 of these troops
are working with U.S. and other Western military units in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council took barely 90 minutes Monday to meet, debate
and pass a resolution condemning the Bali attack and urging nations
to cooperate with Indonesia in the investigation. The council
expressed its "reinforced determination to combat all forms of
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution made no reference to Iraq, and there was little
sign of movement toward agreement on how to confront Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, there was little immediate indication that either
public opinion or governments were linking recent attacks to the
confrontation with Iraq, even though the Bali bombing left scores of
Europeans dead. Terrorism is also suspected in an explosion on a
French oil tanker in Yemen this month.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, both Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary
Jack Straw avoided any mention of Hussein in public remarks Monday on
the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "The response of ourselves and the whole of our partners in the
international community has got to be one of total vigilance and
total determination to take whatever measures are necessary,
nationally and internationally, to deal with this, and that is what
we will do," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said that Monday was a day for expressing sympathy and
outrage over the deaths of at least 33 Britons in Bali, rather than
building support for a confrontation with Iraq. Although Britain has
been the strongest supporter of America's stance against Iraq, Blair
has faced considerable opposition within the ranks of his own Labor
party.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how the upsurge in terrorist activity will affect
either public opinion or the political climate in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Stevenson, editor of the Strategic Survey, a monthly
bulletin published by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies in London, said the Bali bombing could reinforce advocates of
a tough stand against Hussein, who argue that such attacks would be
far worse if carried out with a weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   He added, however, that there was an equally compelling
counter-argument from those convinced that there is no connection
between Hussein and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "They will argue that when all the damage is being done by
terrorist organizations to civilian targets, why are we worrying
about Saddam?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, both Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer issued statements expressing shock at the Bali
attack. They offered assistance in the criminal investigation, but
Fischer also underscored that the attackers were still unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't make that link [between Hussein and Al Qaeda] at the
moment," said Oliver Schramm, press spokesman for the German Embassy
in Washington. "We can't rule it out, but at present no one [in the
German government] is speculating about such a connection."</TE>
<TE>   The absence of any immediate pressure from national capitals means
that as they struggle to agree about wording of a resolution on Iraq,
most members of the 15-nation Security Council remain driven by two
main goals, neither terror-related:</TE>
<TE>   * Agreeing on an unyielding, clear-cut set of rules that gives
U.N. weapons inspectors the power to conduct unconditional,
unfettered searches for Hussein's suspected chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons, with a goal of eliminating all weapons of mass
destruction;</TE>
<TE>   * Forcing Hussein to end a dozen years of defying the Security
Council's will, as expressed in no less than 16 resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue of terrorism should be kept separate," said a diplomat
from a council member country.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the debate in the Security Council is about Iraq's
noncompliance with existing resolutions and what to do about it,"
said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's not
about Iraq's ties with terrorism." Senior Bush administration
officials and some leading Democrats have cited links between Hussein
and Al Qaeda as an important reason why the Iraqi leader should be
forced from power -- through military action if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   In part, this belief is fueled by a potential scenario in which
weapons of mass destruction pass from Hussein into the hands of
terrorists. However, the viability of this connection is not widely
shared outside the United States, even by its allies.</TE>
<TE>   After a trip to the Middle East, Straw met with Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell in Washington on Monday, and further talks were
scheduled for today. Iraq was high on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The five permanent Security Council members -- the U.S., Britain,
France, Russia and China -- were expected to consult today prior to
public sessions of the full council planned for Wednesday and
possibly Thursday about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   During those sessions, representatives of other U.N. member
nations will get a chance to state their views.</TE>

<HD>One Year Later, D.C. Postal Workers Question Handling of
Anthrax Crisis</HD>
<DH>A contaminated facility stayed open for six days after a
deadly letter was found on Capitol Hill. Two employees died; others
are still sick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eddy Ramirez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A year to the day after a deadly anthrax-laden letter was opened in
the office of a U.S. senator, postal worker Terrell Worrell still
wonders why authorities kept the Brentwood mail center open after
work came to a complete halt on Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   For six days after a letter containing the deadly spores appeared
in the office of Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), Worrell and at least
1,700 other employees kept working at the Brentwood facility, where
the letter was processed. Within days, one mail handler tested
positive for inha- lation anthrax and officials shut down the plant.
Two others died shortly after.</LD>
<LD>   The Brentwood center remains closed. Efforts to clean up the
building continue, with hazardous materials teams on a cycle of
"scrubbing" the facility with chlorine dioxide and then testing to
see whether any spores remain. Environmental Protection Agency
officials will review the results of the final test this week before
a date is set for a full building fumigation.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the sender of the Daschle letter is still at large. The
investigation to find out who was behind the series of attacks, which
killed five people, continues. An FBI spokesman declined to comment
except to say that little progress has been made.</TE>
<TE>   As for the postal workers, Worrell said, their bond is stronger,
but so is their grief, fear and resentment. What happened at
Brentwood transformed their lives, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the same man anymore," said Worrell, 39, a father of
three who still complains of trouble breathing, headaches and fatigue
-- all symptoms his doctors say are consistent with anthrax exposure.
"A year after, here we are, still sick and nobody cares."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Brentwood workers are black, and some say they think
of themselves as the forgotten victims not only of an elusive
bioterrorist but of a "racist" experiment by the Centers for Disease
Control to study the effects of anthrax on humans.CDC officials have
repeatedly denied such allegations and say they acted quickly once
they determined that postal workers needed treatment. The postal
workers were treated the same as everyone else potentially exposed to
the bacteria -- including lawmakers, their aides, journalists and
others -- the offi- cials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers such as Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) have
supported continued health monitoring of workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people regarded their tragedy to any real lesser
consequence," Norton said. "But these employees were put in a much
worse position, because a year later we don't know where the letter
came from, we still have very little experience with anthrax and
their building has been left there, unused -- like a hulking monument
for tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Norton won congressional support to rename the Brentwood
center the Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr. Processing and
Distribution Center. The two postal workers died of inhalation
anthrax: Morris, 55, on Oct. 21, and Curseen, 47, a day later. The
men will be remembered at a vigil tonight outside the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Dena Briscoe, a founding member of a support network of postal
workers and family victims called Brentwood Exposed, said the two
veteran postal workers could have been alive today had her superiors
listened to workers complain of flu-like symptoms even before the
anthrax-tainted letter arrived at Daschle's office.</TE>
<TE>   Of 800 workers surveyed by Briscoe's group in March, at least 200
said they became ill, some as early as Oct. 12, when the Daschle
letter passed through Brentwood. Moreover, most of the workers
surveyed did not know safety protocols in dealing with hazardous
materials, Briscoe said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all in the dark about anthrax," said Briscoe, who said
she continues to have respiratory problems, diarrhea and fatigue. "We
had no choice but to trust the Postal Service and the CDC. But they
put profits and science before our safety."</TE>
<TE>   Although a section of the Hart Senate Office Building was closed
and congressional staffers were tested and given antibiotics within
hours after an intern in Daschle's office opened the letter and
released the powdery substance, the Brentwood crew was told to keep
working. Health officials believed it unlikely that anthrax spores
could have leaked from a sealed envelope.</TE>
<TE>   "On the 15th we were victims," said James Harper, another
Brentwood postal worker. "On the 16th we became test subjects. Why?"</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials said they responded as best they could.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened was a tragedy," said Kristin Krathwohl, spokeswoman
for the Postal Service. "At the time, we were relying on health
officials to advise us.... We had no intention to put workers at
risk."</TE>
<TE>   Krathwohl said the Postal Service has since enacted a litany of
precautions to deal with the threat of hazardous materials. And
Congress has authorized spending more than $700 million to install
biohazard detection equipment at postal facilities nationwide. Aware
that many workers fear going back to the facility, Krathwohl said
they will have the option to request transfers or retire.</TE>
<TE>   For Leroy Richmond, the only Brentwood survivor who tested
positive for anthrax, returning is not an option. Richmond, 57, said
he has not regained his strength, not even to play ball with his
7-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a citizen soldier wounded in this war on terror," he said,
"and the powers that be don't even know I exist."</TE>

<HD>Several Bodies Found in Rail Car in Rural Iowa</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENISON, Iowa</DL>
<LD>As many as 11 badly decomposed bodies, possibly belonging to
immigrants who were being smuggled into the country, were found in a
Union Pacific rail car parked at a grain elevator outside of town,
authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   All the victims boarded the train in Mexico, but their nationality
was unconfirmed, said Jerry Heinauer, district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for Nebraska and Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Heinauer said he was told by the Mexican consul that the car left
Matamoros, Mexico, in June. It was parked in Oklahoma before heading
to Denison, about 60 miles northeast of Omaha.</LD>
<TE>   Jose Luis Cuevas, Mexican consul for the Dakotas, Iowa and
Nebraska, said railroad officials had given him the impression that
the bodies had been in the rail car at least four months.</TE>
<TE>   Cuevas and Heinauer said they didn't know whether the victims were
men, women or children.</TE>
<TE>   "We have notified our government and they will advise if they have
people whose whereabouts are not known and that might have been
heading this way," Cuevas said.</TE>
<TE>   Workers were opening up a long line of rail cars Monday and
noticed bodies inside a covered grain car parked at a grain-handling
facility, said Karla Miller, spokeswoman for Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co., the grain-processing and food products giant based in Decatur,
Ill. She said the cars, which had been in storage for several months,
were being cleaned and prepared for grain shipments.</TE>
<TE>   "As the workers were opening the cars up, they discovered several
badly decomposed bodies," Miller said. "As soon as the bodies were
found, we called the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford County Sheriff Tom Hogan said the bodies were left in the
rail car, which would be shipped overnight to Des Moines for
examination by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation and the
state medical examiner. He also said it did not appear that foul play
was involved.</TE>

<LD>The commander of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, camp where suspected

officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Brig. Gen. Rick Baccus left the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay
on Oct. 9, amid unconfirmed reports he had philosophical differences
with those interrogating detainees. Navy officials say Baccus was
removed only because his duties were consolidated with those of a
commander who outranked him.</LD>
<LD>   Baccus also has been relieved of his duties with the Rhode Island
National Guard. Lt. Col. Michael McNamara, a Guard spokesman, said
Baccus wasn't keeping Rhode Island informed of the well-being of
troops, even when officials asked for updates.</LD>

<HD>It's Official: Duct Tape Can Fix Anything</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duct tape, the all-purpose household fix-it with hundreds of uses,
can also remove warts.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers say over-the-hardware-counter duct tape is a more
effective, less painful alternative to liquid nitrogen, which is used
to freeze warts.</LD>
<LD>   The study was reported in the Archives of Pediatrics and
Adolescent Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   In the study, patients wore duct tape over their warts for six
days. Then they removed the tape, soaked the area in water and used
an emery board or pumice stone to scrape the spot. The treatment
continued for a maximum of two months or until the wart went away.</TE>
<TE>   The duct tape apparently caused an immune system reaction that
attacked the growths, said one researcher.</TE>

<HD>Bush Focuses Campaigning on Key Areas</HD>
<DH>President to cross the country for races that could
determine control of Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WATERFORD, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Beginning a planned three weeks of intense travel, President Bush
visited Michigan on Monday to try to turn a hard-fought House race
into a Republican victory as he scraps for the critical seats that
could mean the difference between a GOP or Democratic-led Congress
for the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative schedule devised by the White House has him crossing
the country as the Nov. 5 elections approach, spending no more than
three full days at the White House.</LD>
<LD>   With few exceptions, many of the approximately 15 states Bush is
expected to visit were among the closest in the presidential election
two years ago. Now, they are home to equally close House, Senate or
gubernatorial contests that show much of the country is still evenly
divided. In all likelihood, they also will be of critical importance
in the presidential election two years from now.</LD>
<TE>   As Election Day nears, final decisions about Bush's schedule will
be made by the numbers--the poll figures that indicate where he can
do the most good for the overall Republican cause. GOP candidates who
are clearly winning--or clearly losing--would be unlikely to see the
White House entourage alight in their districts.</TE>
<TE>   For security and political reasons, the president's schedule is
closely held. This week, he is slated to make largely political
visits to Georgia, Florida, Missouri and Minnesota. Other likely
stops before Nov. 5 include South Dakota, South Carolina, North
Carolina, Alabama, Colorado, Tennessee and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple visits are being considered to Florida, where the
president's brother, Jeb, is seeking reelection as governor. Jeb
Bush's defeat at the hands of Democrat Bill McBride would be a sharp
political and personal setback to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple visits also are possible in Minnesota. The outcome of a
close race there between Sen. Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, and
Republican Norm Coleman could determine control of the Senate, where
Democrats now hold a one-seat margin.</TE>
<TE>   While the president is on the road, so, too, is Vice President
Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   His schedule Monday took him to Phoenix, to a fund-raiser for Rick
Renzi in Arizona, and later to a fund-raiser for Steve Pearce in New
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Both Republicans are running for open seats in House races viewed
by analysts as highly competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's wife, Lynne, was raising money Monday in Maryland for
Helen Bentley, a former House member seeking to return after an
eight-year absence.</TE>
<TE>   The time the president and vice president are devoting to House
races is an indication of just how closely the parties are fighting
to gain control of the chamber, which the Republicans now control by
six seats.</TE>
<TE>   When seeking out the few districts that are truly competitive, the
Democrats hit on an open seat south of Detroit as one where, despite
a slight Republican advantage in registration, they might have a
solid opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the campaign, the race in Michigan's 11th district
was not supposed to be close. The district's borders were drawn by
the Republican Legislature, and approved by Republican Gov. John
Engler, to encompass communities where Republicans make up about 54%
of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats' polls rate it a tossup. Although an independent
poll three weeks ago gave the Republican, Thaddeus McCotter, a
15-point lead over Kevin Kelley, a Democrat, 37% said they were
undecided. Michigan also has a strong base of independent voters who
have a history of producing surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney already has campaigned here for McCotter, and Bush's
presence signaled that the Republicans think it is close enough to
require the president to devote half a day here. In his remarks, Bush
delivered a simple message, saying he wants "a Congress with which I
can work." Bush helped raise $1 million for the state Republican
Party and $400,000 for McCotter's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are hoping that in a district with strong union
membership, they will be able to turn resentment over the president's
recent involvement in the West Coast dock strike into support for
their candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the port strike, Bush said he acted because the
longshore workers and the shippers "couldn't get together ... they
were locking down the ports. And that hurt manufacturers here in
Michigan, and it hurt Michigan farmers, and it's going to hurt
Michigan's consumers if it went on too long."</TE>
<TE>   But neither the presence of national figures nor concerns about
the economy or the possibility of war with Iraq have grabbed the
attention of voters, say independent observers.</TE>

<HD>Einhorn, on Stand, Denies Killing Girlfriend</HD>
<DH>Ex-counterculture guru describes a stormy relationship with
Holly Maddux. He said she had moved out of their apartment many
times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two decades as a fugitive, Ira Einhorn took the witness stand
Monday and denied killing a former girlfriend whose mummified body
was found in a locked trunk in his Philadelphia apartment.</LD>
<LD>   "No, I did not kill Holly Maddux," he said during four hours of
testimony in Philadelphia's Common Pleas Court, which was filled with
spectators and reporters. He is scheduled to be cross-examined today.</LD>
<LD>   Describing an increasingly stormy five-year relationship, he said
Maddux -- a blond onetime cheerleader from Texas -- had moved out of
their shared apartment several times because she had "difficulties"
with his womanizing.</LD>
<TE>   The former counterculture guru told the jury that Maddux once left
him for 4 1/2 months, and that he had no idea where she went. He said
Maddux told him in September 1977 that their relationship was over,
and that she traveled from New York to Philadelphia to pick up her
belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn maintained that Maddux left and never returned, despite
telephoning several days later and promising they would stay in
contact. "She never lived up to it," he said. Prosecutors contend
that Einhorn bludgeoned the 30-year-old woman to death on Sept. 11,
1977.</TE>
<TE>   Her remains were not discovered until March 1979. Einhorn
testified that other people had access to his apartment during this
period. After he learned the body police discovered in the trunk was
Maddux, Einhorn said, "I broke up for days. It ripped me to pieces."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Einhorn has contended that he was framed by the CIA
because he was researching psychic phenomena as weaponry, and that
the body was placed in the trunk without his knowledge. He did not
focus on that claim during his appearance Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, which remained open on Columbus Day solely
for Einhorn's trial, defense lawyer William T. Cannon stressed the
importance of his client's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "Ira has taken this whole case into his lap this morning," Cannon
told reporters. "His credibility will determine whether the jury
convicts or acquits him."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that Einhorn, 62, faces an uphill fight against
strong circumstantial evidence. "He has a humongous job," Cannon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another former girlfriend testified last week that Einhorn hit her
with a bottle and tried to strangle her, and that he wrote a poem
titled "An act of violence." A former bookstore owner told the jury
that Einhorn shopped for a how-to manual on converting a corpse into
a mummy.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux traveled from her home in Tyler, Texas, to attend Bryn Mawr
College -- meeting Einhorn at a Philadelphia restaurant popular with
students at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a graduate.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn told the jury his early years with Maddux were loving and
"happy times," but added, "she got increasingly dissatisfied that I
was sleeping with other women."</TE>
<TE>   He said that several times when Maddux left, "she just disappeared
into thin air."</TE>
<TE>   He admitted violent behavior with two women during the 1960s, but
told the jury he went into therapy. "I felt as if the demon was under
control," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of his trial in 1981, Einhorn fled to Europe because,
the defense contends, he believed prosecutors were withholding
evidence from him.</TE>
<TE>   He was tried in absentia in Philadelphia in 1993, convicted of
Maddux's murder and sentenced to death. But after he was captured
living under an assumed name in southern France in 1997, that verdict
was set aside after courts in France ruled that a trial without
Einhorn present was intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition of his extradition, the Pennsylvania Legislature
passed a law granting him a second murder trial where he would not
receive the death penalty if he was found guilty.</TE>

<HD>Push to Ease Immigration Rules Is Finished for Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress and the White House have abandoned a bipartisan effort to
loosen immigration law this year, prompting Democrats to seize on the
issue in a bid to lure Latino voters in the upcoming midterm
elections.</LD>
<LD>   The quiet death of the immigration legislation comes even though
President Bush had urged passage of a bill to make it easier for
certain illegal immigrants to apply for legal residency.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last year and a half, versions of the legislation have
passed twice in the House and once in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation was attacked by opponents as an amnesty in
disguise and supported by proponents as a modest measure to help keep
hard-working immigrant families together in the United States. While
broader reforms were broached last year by the Bush administration,
this legislation was the only significant measure easing immigration
rules to reach a floor vote in this Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates and foes alike say the push to grant protections to
a narrowly defined group of illegal immigrants stalled after the
Sept. 11 attacks caused the government to rethink the connections
between immigration policy and national security.</TE>
<TE>   "Had it not been for Sept. 11," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for
the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors
restrictions, the legislation "probably would have gone through."
Now, he said, the proposal "is pretty much dead for the remainder of
this session of Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Bush twice tried to breathe life into the legislation that would
extend a now-lapsed provision of immigration law known as 245(i). The
extension would have allowed some undocumented immigrants who appear
eligible for permanent residency to apply for legalization from
within the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, such immigrants are required to return to their
native countries to make the application, where they can be forced to
wait years for permission to emigrate. In practice, this requirement
is a powerful deterrent for applicants, because few want to risk
being shut out of the country for as long as a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, after the 245(i) program was resurrected for a few
months under legislation enacted at the end of the Clinton
administration, Bush sought to extend it as a matter of fairness to
some would-be immigrants who had missed the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the announcement helped Bush demonstrate a degree of
distance from a wing of the Republican Party that is, in general,
more skeptical of immigration and seeks, in particular, more
stringent rules against illegal immigration. As a former governor of
the border state of Texas, Bush has long experience with immigration
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-led House responded to the president by passing a narrowly
drafted extension, 336 to 43, in May 2001. The Democratic-controlled
Senate, by unanimous consent, passed a somewhat broader version on
Sept. 6. And then the matter was dropped after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In March of this year, Bush pushed the idea again as part of a
diplomatic initiative before he made a visit to Mexico. The House, by
a vote of 275 to 137, again passed a narrowly crafted measure. But
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and others then objected on national
security grounds to relaxing immigration rules. Many Democrats, on
the other hand, said the 245(i) program should be made permanent law.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to bridge the differences between the House and Senate
died, and the White House made no protest.</TE>
<TE>   It was never clear how many illegal immigrants would have been
aided by the proposals. Estimates ran from a few thousand to tens of
thousands or more.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigration advocacy groups complained that the legislation
was so tightly drawn -- with such a small window of time for
potential applicants -- that its effect would have been small. Others
worried that a limited immigration measure would be misinterpreted in
the immigrant community as a general amnesty.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley said many advocacy groups have now turned their attention
to enacting broader reforms--in the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   With an eye on the political makeup of that next Congress,
Democrats are now pushing a larger package of immigration reforms as
part of a platform plainly meant to win the allegiance of Latino
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The package's centerpiece would grant amnesty to illegal
immigrants who have been in the country for at least five years, have
worked for two years and can pass a background check.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative is going nowhere as this Congress nears
adjournment.</TE>
<TE>   Another immigration proposal that advocates hope to enact this
year would help certain undocumented high school students apply for
college and gain legal status in the United States. The bill, which
would ease a restriction imposed in a 1996 immigration law, is backed
by Sens. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and
has cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee. It also has bipartisan
House support.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, its chances in the waning days of the 107th Congress
remain uncertain.</TE>

<HD>Public's Sniper Theories Abound, but Still No Face</HD>
<DH>There's nothing to go on, no sketch, no description. But
ideas are aplenty, ranging from a loner to a Timothy McVeigh-type.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BETHESDA, Md.</DL>
<LD>They say the slayer is young or they say he's old; describe him as a
hunter or a crazed soldier or a militant foreigner. They say he acts
alone, or with a buddy, or with a girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   "A Timothy McVeigh-type," said a housewife named Caroline.</LD>
<LD>   "A nut that's a sharpshooter," court reporter Harlyne Blum said,
scooting across the parking lot from the gym and ducking into her
car.</LD>
<TE>   "A terrorist," said Arkansas tourist Jim Boyer.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's suburbs have become an unwilling hunting ground
stalked by a faceless sniper -- one who may have struck yet again
Monday night. The public has been given no suspect; no pencil sketch;
no description; no grainy video still; no hometown; no motive. Police
describe a white getaway truck -- but white trucks are everywhere,
idling on street corners, heaving through alleyways, wheeling past on
the freeway. Aside from the maddeningly ubiquitous trucks, there is
just a shadow of a killer, anonymous and mercurial.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of fact, the people of this rattled region are
turning to fancy. Just about everybody has a sniper theory here in
Montgomery County, which is where the shooting spree began 13 days
ago. Since then, 10 people have been shot, eight are dead --
authorities were investigating whether a woman shot dead Monday night
outside a Home Depot in Falls Church, Va., is the 11th victim -- and
locals have adopted all manner of myth to explain the bursts of
curbside death.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is in the same bewildered state, but people have to do
something," Northwestern University sociologist Bernard Beck said.
"If you can say, 'Well, they're more likely to be like this than like
that,' it's an attempt to make yourself feel safer."</TE>
<TE>   And so amateur profilers haunt every corner shop, swapping their
private visions of an unseen killer.</TE>
<TE>   "I picture him as a 25-year-old to 45-year-old gun enthusiast
type. The sort of fellow that would hang out at gun shows," a woman
named Caroline said hours before Monday's shooting. She clutches a
newspaper to her chest, watches the leaves skitter at her feet and
declines to give her last name. "Just a real loser," she added
tersely. "And -- you know -- working-class, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   When authorities released a composite illustration of a workman's
truck over the weekend, Caroline had a rush of vindication. "It fit
what I imagined him doing," she said. "A not very intelligent job."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, an Armenian immigrant named Vart Ozbenian peers
out the window of his grocery. The sky overhead is a flat white; the
avenue stands almost empty. A lone customer shuffles before the deli
case.</TE>
<TE>   "They're terrorists," said Ozbenian, 62. "It seems like they're
very smart. If it were just one crazy man, he'd do something wrong.
He'd kill too many people in one day, and he'd get caught. But these
people are good at their killing."</TE>
<TE>   It has happened time and time again: The unknown is the scariest.
Darkness arranges itself into shapes, and every threatened community
puts a face on its enemy -- usually projecting the fears already
lurking in their midst.</TE>
<TE>   It was a phenomenon noted by Montgomery County Police Chief
Charles A. Moose at Monday's news briefing. "Everybody is edgy," he
told reporters, describing a flurry of calls that turned out to be
car backfires or breaking glass. "People are hearing things."</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people walking around who are already scared
of one thing or another," Beck said. "When something like this comes
along, they already have a menu of specials to chose from. They can
tie this story into the one they already know."</TE>
<TE>   And so the sniper stories are thick in contradiction. A popular
dispute: How many assailants lurk behind the killings?</TE>
<TE>   "He's acting alone," said Dan Grainger, 26. "It would be too hard
for him to have somebody with him. I think he's white. Middle-aged.
Disgruntled -- you know."</TE>
<TE>   "I picture him being by himself," said artist Eileen Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But some witnesses have said two people rode in the white van.
Because snipers often act in pairs, the idea of double gunmen has
some traction.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably working with somebody else, and that's how he's
escaping," said Howard Page. "Maybe he's ditching the weapon in
somebody else's car."</TE>
<TE>   Ranger Surplus had just one bulletproof jacket in stock among the
jumble of pea coats, patches and camouflage--and an elderly woman
snapped it up last week. So the clerks spend a quiet Sunday trying to
cajole customers into buying a T-shirt emblazoned with a target --
and sneering about the sniper's shooting credentials. Where
frightened suburbanites see a gun fanatic, these men swear they spot
a wannabe.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a good shot; he's a coward," scoffed Matt Ashley III.
"He should be able to fire at twice that distance."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, he's not firing far. I bet he's in his -- mmmm, mid- to
late 20s," put in a clerk named Mark.</TE>
<TE>   "Naw, that's not what I say," Ashley said. "I say he's in his 30s
or 40s. A kid would make it more exciting."</TE>
<TE>   In an age punctuated by the macabre drama of killing sprees,
murderers take their place in popular culture as almost allegorical
figures, incarnations of various strains of American fear. For terror
on Lover's Lane, there was the "Son of Sam," David Berkowitz. For
things that go bump in the sorority house, Ted Bundy. Charles Manson
deepened every dark suspicion about drug culture and communal
hippies.</TE>
<TE>   Recent years introduced America to Rafael Resendez Ramirez, a face
for the nebulous menace posed by migrants and hobos, men who live
outside the bounds of stationary society. McVeigh epitomized
patriotism gone bad, a middle-American man twisted by
disillusionment.</TE>
<TE>   In this dubious tradition, Washington's sniper has yet to take his
place. The Beltway killer doesn't epitomize anything. So far, the
gunman is an empty figure.</TE>
<TE>   His very lack of specific notoriety gives rise to a theory of its
own -- the killer as would-be celebrity. "It's somebody who wants to
make a name for himself," Boyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Bethesda cafe manager Danny Lopes, who regards the
sniper as another sinister outcropping of a bleak geopolitical
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics. I'm sure it's politics. Maybe one or two guys working
in conjunction. Anybody Middle Eastern, you know?" said Lopes, 26,
pushing his mop across the floorboards in the empty hours before the
lunch rush.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, think about it: The shooting starts just as Bush is going
after Iraq. You know, oil, and they're targeting gas stations" --
where four of the victims were slain. Lopes gives the mop another
shove. "It's just too coincidental."</TE>
<TE>   Among all the quibbling, all the conspiracy theory, there is
exactly one common theme. Nobody here on the capital's hem seems to
believe the bloodshed will stop -- not until the sniper is captured.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would he stop? He's successful," said Blum, the court
reporter. "He's not only killing people with one shot, he's got the
entire community in an uproar. I think he enjoys it."</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Supplement Slows Down Parkinson's</HD>
<DH>Progression of the disease was reduced as much as 44%.
Doctors caution against taking coenzyme Q-10 until wider survey is
taken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A common food supplement called coenzyme Q-10 can significantly delay
the progression of Parkinson's disease, slowing the degeneration of
brain cells, a UC San Diego-led team reports today. A nationwide
trial in 80 patients found that the supplement can reduce progression
of the debilitating disorder by as much as 44%, prolonging the period
in which patients can carry out such everyday functions as feeding,
dressing, bathing and walking.</LD>
<LD>   But the study's authors and other experts cautioned patients
against taking the supplement on their own until its value can be
proven in a larger study.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very interesting, and they may be on to something, but they
need a larger study," said Dr. Abraham Lieberman of the National
Parkinson Foundation. "It's going to be another three to four years
before we can say for sure whether this works or not."</LD>
<TE>   That larger study should begin as soon as possible, said Dr.
Bernard Ravina of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke, which funded the current study. Scientists should follow
up on it "pretty aggressively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parkinson's, which strikes as many as 100,000 Americans each year,
is characterized by severe tremors and rigidity in the limbs and loss
of muscle control. Although its primary cause is unknown, the
disorder results from the death of brain cells that produce dopamine,
which plays a key role in transmitting commands from the brain's
muscle-control centers.</TE>
<TE>   The first line of treatment is the use of drugs, such as l-dopa,
which stimulate production of dopamine. Those drugs alleviate
symptoms of the disease, but do not delay progression. Results with
two new drugs called mirapex and ropinirole, released earlier this
year, suggest that they do delay progression, but only by about half
as much as coenzyme Q-10 did in the new study.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego team had a good reason to test the supplement,
Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Coenzyme Q-10, also known as ubiquinone, plays a key role in
mitochondria, energy-producing sites within each cell of the body.
More than a decade of research by Dr. Clifford Shults and Dr. Richard
Haas of UC San Diego and Dr. Flint Beal, now at Cornell University's
Weill Medical College, showed that mitochondria function is impaired
in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, and that levels
of ubiquinone are unusually low in these mitochondria.</TE>
<TE>   The supplement is also an antioxidant, and other studies have
suggested that antioxidants are useful in treating Parkinson's.</TE>
<TE>   Studies of mice with a Parkinson-like disease showed that
administering coenzyme Q-10 could preserve brain tissue. A
preliminary study in 15 humans suggested the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The current study involved patients who were recently diagnosed
with Parkinson's and who were not taking any other medications for
the disorder. The coenzyme Q-10 and placebo used in the study were
formulated into wafers by Vitaline Formula of Ashland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Half the 80 patients received a placebo. The other half received
either 300, 600 or 1,200 milligrams of coenzyme Q-10 every day for 16
months or until they required therapy with other drugs. Their ability
to carry out everyday functions was evaluated at regular intervals.</TE>
<TE>   The team reports today in the Archives of Neurology that patients
receiving the lower doses of coenzyme Q-10 fared better than those
receiving the placebo, and that the 23 patients receiving the highest
dose fared significantly better. The results did not begin to become
apparent until several months into the study, indicating that the
supplement does not ameliorate symptoms, but rather that it delays
progression.</TE>
<TE>   That is, patients don't get better when they take the supplement.
They just don't get worse as fast.</TE>
<TE>   The results "are tremendously encouraging," Shults said.</TE>
<TE>   "However, before the compound is widely used, the results need to
be confirmed in a larger group of patients." He cautioned that
widespread use of the supplement by patients would make it difficult
to recruit enough patients for a definitive study.</TE>
<TE>   The supplement is also relatively expensive. "The dose of Q-10
that you need costs $150 to $300 per month" and insurance companies
will not pay for it, Lieberman said, "so you would be asking people
to spend $2,000 to $3,000 per year on a compound that may not do what
the study says it is going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Many Parkinson's patients are elderly and already paying as much
as $3,000 per year for medications on limited budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you are fairly well-to-do, that is a lot of money,"
Lieberman said.</TE>
