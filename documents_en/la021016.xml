<LD>The 2003 model-year car show circuit kicks off in Anaheim this
evening with the opening of the California International Auto Show.</LD>
<LD>   The event, which features hundreds of new cars and trucks, concept
vehicles and a special design display, runs through Sunday at the
Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   As the first show of the season, it gives car shoppers and
automotive buffs a chance to check out all the latest vehicles,
available now and in coming months at local dealerships, without
sales pressure.</LD>

highlights unconventional vehicles such as the new Segway Human
Transporter, a self-balancing, two-wheel stand-up "scooter" designed
to operate in pedestrian environments.</TE>
<TE>   Global Electric Motors, a DaimlerChrysler unit, will display its
GEM neighborhood electric vehicles. And Super Street Magazine will
host a display of so-called tuner cars--conventional compact cars,
usually imports, that are heavily modified with aftermarket
performance and appearance equipment.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a special display of custom vehicles built by Long
Beach-based motorcycle builder Jesse James for Discovery Channel's
"Monster Garage."</TE>

<HD>Hybrid sports car on the drawing board</HD>
<DH>Acura concept car showcases dual-power muscle</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sleek and powerful hybrid sports car concept that Honda Motor Co.
unveiled last year at the Tokyo Auto Show could be the basis of a
real production car from Acura.</LD>
<LD>   If given the go-ahead, the car--code-named the DN-X--would turn
heads not only because of its looks but also because it would show
that hybrids don't have to be automotive milquetoasts.</LD>
<LD>   The concept car used a 300-horsepower V-6 coupled with a
100-horsepower electric motor to give it the performance of a
400-horsepower muscle car with excellent fuel economy.</LD>
<TE>   It's not quite what the Sierra Club had in mind when it awarded
Honda its first endorsement of an automotive product at the
introduction of the Insight hybrid in Los Angeles a few years ago.
But Honda officials say making hybrid power systems available across
a broad spectrum of product types -- including performance cars -- is
the best way to win widespread consumer acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   A high-output gas engine, even in a Honda, is not going to be
emission-free, but it could garner a low-emission vehicle or even a
super-ultra-low-emission vehicle rating, depending on how it is
tuned. And when augmented with a high-torque electric motor that will
provide lots of boost during acceleration, the system shown on the
DN-X could achieve average fuel economy of 42 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad considering most 400-horsepower cars and trucks are doing
well these days if they hit 15 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   The concept, which was called the Honda Dualnote when it was shown
at Tokyo and became the Acura DN-X this year at the New York Auto
Show, uses the gasoline engine to drive the rear wheels and the
electric motor to drive all four wheels. Honda has used the same
system -- with a smaller gas engine -- in a concept sport utility
vehicle, the RDX hybrid, shown this year at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Acura spokesman Mike Spencer, at American Honda Motor Co. in
Torrance, says there's been no decision on a production version of
either concept, but repeats what top Honda officials have said
several times in the last two years: The company wants to go beyond
its present hybrid offerings, the two-seat Insight and the five-seat
Civic Hybrid, with gas-electric powertrain technology.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be an all-wheel-drive system" suitable for a hybrid SUV
derived from the RDX concept "or an all-wheel-drive, high-performance
system" such as that shown on the Dualnote/DN-X "or both," he said,
leaving open the likelihood that both an SUV and a sports car are on
the table but offering little clue as to which might be first.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit-based AutoWeek magazine recently reported that it will be
the sports car, and no less an authority than Tom Elliot, American
Honda's executive vice president, also has said that a hybrid Acura
sports car is the likely follow-up to the Honda Insight and Civic
hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Justification for a hybrid high-performance Acura, other than
helping spread the word about dual-power systems, is that it enables
the car maker to boost performance without installing "a gas-guzzling
V-10 or V-12," as some of the competitors are doing, Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   Using the smaller V-6 and integrated electric motor also gives
Honda designers lots of room for a large passenger cabin in a compact
exterior package.</TE>
<TE>   Natural gas stations</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to market natural gas-powered vehicles have long been
frustrated by a dearth of public refueling stations.</TE>
<TE>   Now Toronto-based FuelMaker Corp. has developed and will begin
selling a home fueling system that hooks into residential gas lines
and makes it possible to fill a natural gas vehicle's tanks daily.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing for the device, called Phill, hasn't been set, but
FuelMaker says it hopes to bring it to market for less than $2,000
next year. The price should fall to $999 when volume production is
achieved. That should be within two years of introduction, said
FuelMaker spokeswoman Amy Chaput, but it depends on public acceptance
of natural gas vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrently, and not coincidentally, American Honda says it will
start marketing its natural gas vehicle, the Honda Civic GX, to
retail customers in all 50 states by next spring. American Honda owns
20% of FuelMaker.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic GX has been around since 1998, but like other natural
gas vehicles from Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Chrysler
Corp., it is sold almost exclusively for government fleets, because
Honda did not believe the public would be comfortable with a car with
hard-to-find fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "Home refueling will help to increase consumer acceptance of
natural gas-powered vehicles," said Robert Bienenfeld, senior manager
of product planning at American Honda and chairman of the Natural Gas
Vehicle Coalition board of directors. "Our research indicates people
like the idea of being able to refuel their vehicles at home."</TE>
<TE>   FuelMaker says Phill can be installed in a garage and allows
natural gas-powered vehicles to be refueled from a homeowner's
existing natural gas supply line.</TE>
<TE>   The system compresses gas from the residential line and pumps it
into the vehicle's tank through a special nozzle.</TE>
<TE>   It will be certified as a natural gas appliance, meeting the same
safety requirements as natural gas water heaters and clothes dryers,
and come with a gas leak warning alarm that automatically shuts down
the system in the event of a leak, Chaput said.</TE>
<TE>   The Civic GX sedan uses a 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine with a
range of up to 220 miles on an eight-gallon tank of compressed
natural gas. Base price is $20,510, and Honda figures it will sell
about 5,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Honda describes the GX as a "nearly zero-emissions" car, and the
California Air Resources Board certifies it as a
super-ultra-low-emission vehicle. (It also qualified for the board's
special PZEV, or partial zero-emission-vehicle, credit when the
state's zero-emission-vehicle mandate was in force, but that has been
put aside until a General Motors suit challenging the ZEV mandate is
resolved.)</TE>
<TE>   One immediate boost for natural gas vehicle sales in California
might be that state law lets them use freeway diamond lanes as
single-occupant vehicles, the same benefit allowed motorcycles and
electric vehicles (hybrids, which combine gasoline engines and
electric motors, cannot use the diamond lanes unless there are two or
more people inside).</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Civic GX, another natural gas vehicle now
available is the Ford Crown Victoria, said Paul Vetter, spokesman for
the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition. Consumers, however,
will face the task of persuading a dealer to order one.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet makes a natural gas Cavalier sedan; Ford and General
Motors make natural gas pickup trucks; and Ford, GM and Chrysler make
natural gas vans, but those vehicles are marketed almost exclusively
as commercial and government fleet vehicles, Vetter said.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler recall to check for fuel leak</HD>
<DH>GM also is calling back SUVs to add a device to keep
fingers from being pinched in the folding seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost 25% of DaimlerChrysler's 2002 model Dodge and Chrysler
minivans are being recalled because of a possible fuel leak, the
company said Tuesday. General Motors Corp. also is calling back more
than half a million sport utility vehicles to add a device to keep
fingers from being pinched in the folding seats.</LD>
<LD>   The minivan recall involves 145,000 Dodge Grand Caravan and
Chrysler Town &amp; Country models built at Chrysler's Windsor, Canada,
plant from Sept. 1, 2001, through March 11.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler says some of the joints on the fuel tank control
valve were not welded properly. The company says no fires or injuries
have been reported.</LD>
<TE>   Notification of affected owners will begin later this month, but
Chrysler said owners who smell fuel or notice a leak should
immediately take the vehicle to a dealer for an inspection and any
necessary repair.</TE>
<TE>   The GM recall is the sixth this year for its popular SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it involves 597,000 of its 2000 to 2002 full-size sport
utility vehicles, which need a plastic shield to protect people from
pinching their fingers when folding the seats.</TE>
<TE>   The recall was ordered just before the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration this month said it was launching an engineering
analysis of the throttle mechanisms in 3.1 million full-size GM
pickups and SUVs from the 1999 to 2002 model years. The engineering
analysis, a step that often precedes a recall order from the safety
agency, involves a throttle problem linked to several dozen
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   GM said the seat repair recall involves its Chevrolet Tahoe,
Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon and Denali SUVs. The company said 14
people have pinched their fingers when the head restraint was being
moved to permit the second-row seats to be folded away.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of the recalled SUVs, built between September 1999 and
February 2002, can have the shields installed for free at Chevrolet,
Cadillac and GMC dealers.</TE>
<TE>   In its monthly summary of vehicle defect investigations, NHTSA
also said it was launching engineering analyses of allegedly faulty
tire air valves on 879,103 F-series Super Duty trucks and full-size
Econoline vans manufactured by Ford Motor Co., and of seat fire
problems reported in 1996 and '97 Volvo 850 sedans and station
wagons.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said its GM probe involves throttles on Chevrolet Silverado
and GMC Sierra pickups and Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and Avalanche,
GMC Yukon and Yukon XL and Cadillac Escalade SUVs from the 1999 to
2002 model years.</TE>
<TE>   "The blade in the throttle body can stick in the closed position
or less frequently in a partially open position," the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ford case, NHTSA said it believes a faulty tire valve
problem that led to the recall of 112,000 F-450 and F-550 trucks in
March involves more than 750,000 additional vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers can lose control of their vehicles because of rapid tire
deflation when valve stems fail. NHTSA's decision to look into Volvo
seat fires came after the agency received reports of three injuries
and 17 suits involving seat fires in the 850 series vehicles. The
alleged defect stems from problems with the power-seat motor, heater
element, thermostat or grounding of the seat-wiring harness
assemblies, NHTSA said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, NHTSA has released its monthly recall reminder list to
provide vehicle owners a second public notice of recalls initially
issued in a previous month. This month's reminders are from August.</TE>
<TE>   BMW</TE>
<TE>   BMW 323i and 328i, 20,500 cars built from April to August 1999 and
sold as 1999 models. BMW has issued the recall to recalibrate the
air-bag control module to reduce the possibility of improper
deployment of the side air bags.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler PT Cruisers, 345,436 vehicles from the 2001 and 2002
model years, for inspection and repair of a potentially faulty fuel
pump mounting flange.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler also is recalling 97,779 PT Cruisers, built from May 2000
to January 2001 and sold as 2001 models, for inspection of a
potentially improperly installed fuel supply line that can chafe and
begin leaking.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Accord cars, Odyssey minivans and Pilot SUVs and Acura TL
and CL passenger cars and MDX sport utility vehicles. Involves 17,500
vehicles: 2002 model-year Accords and Odysseys and 2003 models of the
others.</TE>
<TE>   The recall is to inspect for and repair a misaligned timing belt
pulley that could cause the belt to wear and break.</TE>
<TE>   Rollover ratings</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has posted its
crash test results and rollover ratings for selected 2002 and 2003
models on its Web site: www.nhtsa.dot.gov.</TE>

<HD>Mercury reintroduces the Monterey</HD>
<DH>The luxury minivan, slated to go on the market in late
2004, will come with a 4.2-liter V-6 engine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the early 1950s through the mid-'70s, the Monterey was a
top-of-the-line Mercury passenger car.</LD>
<LD>   The name is being resurrected, but this time around the Monterey
will be a Mercury minivan.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Mercury, which this year discontinued the Villager
minivan that it jointly developed with Nissan (the Nissan Quest, also
gone), says it will launch the replacement late next year as a 2004
model.</LD>
<TE>   The van will be built in Canada along with the next-generation '04
Ford Windstar and, Mercury says, will offer features such as
side-curtain air bags that provide protection for all three rows of
seats; advanced tire pressure monitoring; heated and cooled front
seats; bumper-mounted front and rear object-sensing systems and a
segment-leading 4.2-liter V-6 engine.</TE>
<TE>   Pricing hasn't been announced, but Mercury executives say the
Monterey will be positioned as a luxury minivan, so figure a starting
price at or just above $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Monterey is part of a line of new products that includes the
redesigned Mountaineer sport utility vehicle and the Marauder
high-powered sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Elena Ford, Mercury's marketing manager and a member of the Ford
family, says it will be followed by "at least one new Mercury car or
SUV each year for the next several years." Sounds as if Ford Motor
Co. is serious about its pledge to keep alive the once-proud Mercury
brand.</TE>

<HD>A lot of people say they have heard enough</HD>
<DH>Excessively loud car sound systems have become a
quality-of-life issue. Police agencies are cracking down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeanne Wright</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proliferation of "boom cars" -- vehicles equipped with monster
audio systems loud enough to trigger avalanches -- has led to growing
outrage among residents who are fed up with the noise.</LD>
<LD>   Complaints nationwide from angry drivers who get stuck in traffic
next to ridiculously loud, thumping stereos, or from residents whose
neighborhoods are plagued by cruisers cranking up their music, have
led to crackdowns by law enforcement agencies and warnings from
medical experts.</LD>
<LD>   Combating ear-shattering car stereo noise has become a
quality-of-life issue that's being tackled from New York City, where
the mayor recently launched Operation Silent Night, to Southern
California, where police are ticketing and fining drivers whose
blaring stereos disturb the peace.</LD>
<TE>   The problem has become so pervasive that the Justice Department
last summer released a report that cited health risks and inability
to hear emergency vehicle sirens as reasons to keep car stereos
turned down.</TE>
<TE>   But the feds are concerned for even more serious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "In some jurisdictions, drug dealers advertise by cruising
neighborhoods with the car stereo turned up loud," says the report,
written by the department's Office of Community Oriented Policing
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Traffic Sgt. Rich Meyer agrees. He said police
sometimes find gangs using boom cars to make their presence known.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department report said problems involving loud car
stereos are more widespread than has been thought. Because many
residents are unaware that they have the legal right to a quiet
environment, only about 5% to 10% of people bothered by the noise
file official complaints, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Police recommend that people avoid confronting offenders directly,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an outrageous problem. It's acoustic terrorism," says Ted
Kuerter, director of Noise Free America, a citizens' group that has
called for tougher noise laws and enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities do have stiffer penalties than California's typical
$100 fines. Drivers of boom cars in Chicago risk having their
vehicles towed away and being fined up to $615 if their audio system
can be heard 75 feet away. In Papillon, Neb., car stereo owners who
blast their music face a three-month jail sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In California last year, the Highway Patrol issued 1,791 citations
to drivers who violated Vehicle Code Section 1791. It says it is
illegal to have an automotive sound system turned up so that it can
be heard more than 50 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Long Beach are more aggressive: They issued 1,020
citations in one six-month period last year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the annoyance factor, thundering high-power stereo
systems create "toxic noise" that poses a serious health threat, says
Elizabeth Thorp, director of the National Campaign for Hearing
Health.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-eight million people have hearing loss in the U.S., and
about 10 million of those cases can be partially attributed to loud
noises," Thorp says.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerter and other anti-noise activists criticize manufacturers of
today's generation of powerful automotive audio systems for promoting
a culture of incivility.</TE>
<TE>   They say manufacturers know they are selling equipment that, when
used to maximum potential, violates the law.</TE>
<TE>   The Consumer Electronics Assn.'s position on loud auto stereos is
that the trade group "strongly supports sound ordinances, as they
maintain the quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   However, the association's Web site says it also is "concerned
about harsh penalties and subjective enforcement guidelines that
might have adverse effects on the car audio retail industry and
consumers."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the 1998 enactment of a tough noise ordinance
targeting loud car stereos in Chicago, the CEA says, an industry
survey found that local car audio businesses saw an average 33%
downturn in business.</TE>
<TE>   Some stereo installers agree that the big sound systems are
purchased for reasons other than personal enjoyment.</TE>
<TE>   Tri Vo, manager of Super Sound &amp; Wireless Communication in Long
Beach, says many of the young men who go there to get systems
installed like the big sound because it "gets the attention of a lot
of people -- especially the girls. When the vibration is really hard,
the whole car rattles and it makes them feel really powerful," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Noise Free America's Kuerter said one young man told him the
sensation is "better than sex."</TE>
<TE>   Not all boom fans are inconsiderate, though. Vo has a $4,000
stereo system in his vehicle but says he refrains from turning the
volume up too high.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe believes that educating young people and others about the
dangers of high levels of noise exposure is critical.</TE>
<TE>   But she's found that it can be a tough job. Teens often don't
understand, she said, that once you suffer ear damage, you may never
recover your hearing.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of a private woman: the real Alice Faye</HD>
<DH>Alice Faye: A Life Beyond the Silver Screen; By Jane Lenz
Elder; University Press of Mississippi; 256 pages, $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alice Faye, who died at 83 in 1998, was a cherished star of Hollywood
musicals in the late 1930s and early '40s who stayed in the public
eye almost until her death, even though she walked out on a
flourishing movie career in 1945. A beautiful blue-eyed blond with a
stunning figure, a warm personality and low singing voice, she
brought a sultry quality to the screen.</LD>
<LD>   In a mere six years at 20th Century Fox, Faye became America's No.
1 female box office star. Her talent and natural appeal shone through
formulaic Fox musicals like "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Rose of
Washington Square," "Lillian Russell" and "Tin Pan Alley."</LD>
<LD>   When Faye married the brash bandleader-comedian Phil Harris,
Hollywood said it wouldn't last, but the couple, who had two
daughters, had been happily married 54 years when he died in 1995 at
age 90. They were a handsome pair who aged gracefully and left their
friends and fans with fond memories.</LD>
<TE>   Jane Lenz Elder's illuminating "Alice Faye: A Life Beyond the
Silver Screen" is not the standard movie star biography dripping with
nostalgia and shameless heart-tugging. It is a full-length portrait
of an essentially private woman long on common sense and inner
strength, one who was grateful for the opportunities that came her
way and who learned over time how to stand up for herself.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Jeane Leppert was born on May 5, 1915, in a cold-water flat
in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. Her father was a policeman, and her
mother took factory jobs to help support their daughter and two older
sons. Faye told musical historian Miles Kreuger bluntly that "if you
were pretty, and you grew up on Double Fifth Avenue, you either hit
the stage or the streets."</TE>
<TE>   She got her first job at 12 working in the dressing room at a
dancing school; the next year, lying about her age, she landed in the
chorus of Earl Carroll's Vanities, moved on to the Capitol Theater
and caught the attention of radio star-restaurateur Niles T.
Granlund. At 17 Faye got her first taste of celebrity as a singer on
Rudy Vallee's popular radio program. Vallee became her mentor, which
incited his wife's jealousy, and for the rest of her life she denied
having an affair with him. Radio singing stardom led to an offer from
Fox in 1934. Elder makes clear that Darryl F. Zanuck was quick to
exploit Faye's popularity; she once called the studio Penitentiary
Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Elder suggests that a turning point in Faye's life and career
occurred when she fell in love with fellow Fox contractee Tony Martin
and married him in 1937, just when her career was at its busiest. He
was often on the road, and the Martins were together only eight
months of their 28-month marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Although Faye would never say more than "the marriage simply
didn't work out," Elder writes that Faye took the failure of the
marriage hard, and began to question her priorities and resist
Zanuck's demands. Even though she became determined to put her second
marriage first, she continued with her career.</TE>
<TE>   She had gotten her big break as a dramatic actress when Jean
Harlow, who was to star in Fox's "In Old Chicago" on loan from MGM,
died at age 26. Faye saw her chance in Otto Preminger's murder
mystery "Fallen Angel," in which she played a small-town heiress
almost past her prime, but Zanuck, with whom she sparred increasingly
over the years, cut her part drastically to build up newcomer Linda
Darnell. Faye took one look at the finished film, wrote Zanuck an
unprintable note and left the studio, not to return for more than 15
years, an act unheard of for a star in Hollywood's golden age.</TE>
<TE>   Elder writes that the resilient Faye may have disappeared from the
screen but not to the obscurity of domesticity, as important as that
became to her. The next year she returned to radio, and she and
Harris did a weekly program until 1954. Elder regrets that Faye did
not do more recording.(Faye's unforgettable rendition of "You'll
Never Know" became a World War II anthem.)</TE>
<TE>   During the next decades, Faye performed occasionally and in 1973
returned to the stage in a revival of the musical "Good News." In the
1980s she became a spokeswoman for Pfizer.</TE>
<TE>   Elder allows us to see that Faye was indeed "an elegant lady whose
greatest riches were her friends, fans and daughters and who gave her
audiences much to enjoy."</TE>

<DH>Tony Hawk adds a live soundtrack to new skateboard
platform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN JOSE -- The Boom Boom HuckJam is all crazy vert thrills and
monstrous airs. There are triple barspins, kick flips and -- bonus!
-- Dexter and Noodles in the back just raging away.</LD>
<LD>   Now, if you can decipher any of that, you probably already know
that skateboarder Tony Hawk is coming to town with the most novel
arena tour of the season, the curiously named Boom Boom HuckJam. It's
a glitzy rock 'n' roll circus on wheels, with action sports and music
stars such as the Offspring and Devo under one tent. It's sort of
like Ice Capades with a halfpipe and a house band instead of the ice.</LD>
<LD>   For those of you still scratching your heads, a quick primer: The
most recognizable athlete among middle-school boys today is not Kobe
Bryant or Brett Favre. It's Hawk, the serene, stork-like skateboarder
who has become a one-man business empire. His video games, DVDs and
endorsements have made him the Wayne Gretzky of skateboarding--a
prolific star who comfortably wears the role of genial ambassador
guiding his sport to bigger audiences.</LD>
<TE>   This tour is a testament to Hawk as a brand name and a new
achievement in a career that began 20 years ago when, at age 14, the
San Diego County native became a professional skateboarder. For
years, that pro status meant touring in a creaky van and earning more
applause than money for his specialized prowess. Nowadays, he gets
mobbed by kids who may know him best as the digital star of a line of
best-selling video games.</TE>
<TE>   Those video games make it a natural for Hawk to share a stage with
rock stars (his latest, Pro Skater 3, features a soundtrack with the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ramones, Adolescents and more). And its
nothing new to see action sports on the periphery of concerts, such
as the annual Vans Warped Tour. The innovation of HuckJam, though, is
its scale and its promise to keep the athletes in the main spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "The action was always a sideshow to the music at concerts. With
this we take the focus to the action, but we have the music there in
a strong way," Hawk said as he prepared for the San Jose show. "And
the ramps we use are state of the art; there's never been anything
like this before on tour. And that band playing, the live music, the
intensity for us out there is completely different than if we were
just on by ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   When the tour arrives at the Arrowhead Pond on Oct. 26, it will be
Devo providing the soundtrack, but for the third show of the tour, at
the Compaq Center here on Saturday, it was the Offspring, a group
that has sold 12 million albums in the U.S. and has a pop-punk ethos
that seems a perfect mate in a marriage of rock concert and
skateboarding.</TE>
<TE>   But the result is, well ... weird. Not bad, just weird. And
sometimes a little scary.</TE>
<TE>   After Hawk, the real star of the show is the set, a $1.5 million
latticework of ramps and platforms that Hawk says he dreamed up "and
drew on some napkin a few years ago." At the center is a huge
halfpipe (its big enough to park an RV on) that creates a curved
canyon for Hawk and his fellow dream team of skateboard stars, which
includes Andy Macdonald and Bucky Lasek.</TE>
<TE>   Joining them is a squad of BMX stars, such as Dave Mirra. At
points in the show, these off-road bicyclists weave around and above
their skateboarding peers in a dance that seems, to the uninitiated,
patently unwise. Then, to grill the nerves further, Cary Hart and a
team of motocross bikers race around the halfpipe and routinely let
go of their handlebars, even while leaping just over the heads of
their non-motorized buddies.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yeah, there's a band playing. It was easy to forget at
times. The members of the Offspring, led by singer Bryan "Dexter"
Holland and loopy guitarist Kevin "Noodles" Wasserman, were perched
on a tall stage at a far end of the arena floor. They played at
thunderous volume, but with guys riding their bikes like surfboards,
who watches the band?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we're not used to being background music, like a DJ or
something," a good-natured Holland offered backstage. The band's
manager, Jim Guerinot, is also co-managing the HuckJam tour (along
with Pat Hawk, the skateboarder's sister), and his urging to
participate in HuckJam was good enough for the band. Holland also
signed on knowing that many youngsters would be in the audience with
their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the first concert a lot of these kids have
ever seen, so that's cool to think about," Holland said.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt it was the first show for many in the audience at
the Compaq Center in San Jose -- the crowd here was dominated by boys
ages 4 to 10 and their parents. The organizers of the tour knew the
crowds would skew young, but even they were surprised by how young.
Before the 22-city tour began this month, the HuckJam model was tried
out with a Las Vegas show in April. The tour organizers, watching
adolescents and toddlers file into the venue, decided at the last
minute to yank many of the stage explosions they had planned for fear
of too badly rattling their wide-eyed crowd.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Offspring's pop-leaning take on punk has made them a
favorite of many youngsters, the band has had to tailor its set for
the romper room. It performed "Bad Habit," a jagged ode to road rage
with a few profanities, at the HuckJam stop in Portland, and parents
complained. At the second stop, in Tacoma, they changed some of the
lyrics, but that felt awkward for them. In San Jose, they just
skipped the song altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Hawk says there have been some complaints about the sound level,
but in the crowd's applause and in his informal surveys he hears far
more good reviews. He also chafes at the suggestion that it's a
kids-only endeavor. "This is not Disney on Ice, this is something
that transcends generations," the father of three says.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents in San Jose clearly enjoyed the Offspring's set,
others winced at the volume and suspiciously eyed the skulls and
decapitated doll's heads decorating the band's gear. Other parents,
with their kids plugging their ears or looking a bit spent, headed
for the exits early as the three-hour exhibition of music and stunts
continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Too long and too loud for the little ones," was the appraisal of
Brad Jenkel, a father who brought his 4-year-old boy, Tyler, to see
his hero Hawk. "But it was great, really." Behind the father and son,
a long line of fans were missing the tail-end of the Offspring set as
they waited to scoop up T-shirts and glossy $20 programs. A mother
walked by with a sobbing toddler. "He's tied," she said without
breaking stride. "And it was a little too scary for him."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for the second time in three shows, a BMX rider and a
motocross rider came perilously close in the show's grand finale.
Several performers entered the backstage corridors and threw their
helmets in anger. Hawk huddled with them briefly to defuse the
situation. There was already tension, too, about last-minute
tinkering with the show's program and with changes in ramp distances,
the latter issue an unavoidable one with the vagaries of different
arenas. "We have some things to figure out," Hawk said.</TE>
<TE>   The tour itself was a major question mark (the nation's top
concert promotion outfit, Clear Channel, passed on it) and it's been
hard at times for organizers of the show to explain exactly what it
is to some fans, much less their parents. But Hawk's name and word of
mouth have made the difference so far. The first shows have turned a
profit -- the kick-off crowd in Portland topped 10,300, the Tacoma
crowd swelled to 11,500 -- and it appears to be building momentum.
That comes in the face of huge costs associated with show's setup and
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We were prepared to lose money, but so far,"Hawk says, "it's
going well." He hopes the tour fares well enough to add international
dates, which would only enhance his role as ambassador on wheels.
"They haven't seen anything like this overseas, and I'd love to have
more people understand what we're doing"</TE>
<TE>   The curiosity of the Boom Boom Huckjam continues, but Paul
Tollett, the promoter handling the San Jose, San Diego and Anaheim
dates of the tour, says there are plenty of young Hawk fans ready to
translate. "We didn't know what would happen with this," said
Tollett, who is far more accustomed to sizing up the crowd calculus
of rock shows. "How could we? But you know why I got in? My daughter
is 7 and she knows who Tony Hawk is and asked me if I could introduce
her to him. She's never done that for any other show."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If prime-time scheduling is a bit of a chess match, broadcasting
playoff baseball limits the moves available to the host network -- a
handicap Fox is again grappling to overcome this season.</LD>
<LD>   The network, which will televise the World Series beginning
Saturday, generally attracts a younger audience than the elder
broadcast networks, whereas baseball skews a bit older and primarily
appeals to men.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, both League Championship Series ended in five games
after the San Francisco Giants' elimination of St. Louis on Monday,
setting up an all-California World Series, fraught with its own
potential ratings headaches. As a result, Fox has been forced to run
two nights of repeats heading into the Series, essentially sitting
out the ratings derby while competitors' programs attempt to
establish a toehold with viewers.</LD>
<TE>   The network did scramble to put on an original program Thursday
night, scheduling a live edition of "America's Most Wanted" focusing
on the sniper attacks surrounding Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a blessing and a curse," said David Poltrack,
executive vice president of research at CBS, which aired the playoffs
exclusively from 1990 to 1993. "When it works, it gets some very nice
ratings, and that's very helpful, but it really is a nightmare for
the programming people."</TE>
<TE>   Fox officials acknowledge that having to preempt or delay its
regular programs is frustrating and has probably freed a segment of
the audience to sample rival networks, allowing younger viewers of
its popular sitcom "That '70s Show," for example, to take a look at
ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter," starring John
Ritter, at 8 p.m. Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the WB superhero series "Birds of Prey" opened to
strong ratings last Wednesday, and tonight will face a rerun of Fox's
new action show "Fastlane," thrown on with little promotion because
there's no baseball.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the network is hoping that large audiences for
the World Series will provide a springboard for programs, with series
such as "24," "Malcolm in the Middle," producer David E. Kelley's new
legal series, "girls club," and "Boston Public" all scheduled to
begin their seasons in late October, just before the November rating
sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Beckman, Fox's executive vice president of strategic
program planning, called ratings for baseball "a borrowed audience,"
in the sense that the games bring people to the set who are not
frequent viewers of prime-time series in general and, in some
instances, Fox in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the extensive promotion viewers will see during the games,
he said, "It's our job to convince them there are some good shows
over here."</TE>
<TE>   Fox has expressed little concern, meanwhile, about the fact that
it has ended up with two teams from California, maintaining that a
hotly contested six- or seven-game series is always the panacea for
such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   It does help having major TV markets represented, and Los Angeles
and San Francisco are the nation's second and fifth largest,
respectively, jointly accounting for more than 7% of all U.S. homes
with television.</TE>
<TE>   Still, having both teams on the West Coast could play a role in
how the games affect competitors. Any championship inevitably
attracts its biggest ratings in the host cities, meaning the highest
tune-in will be in the Los Angeles and San Francisco viewing areas,
where the games will likely be over before 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that dynamic, CBS' Poltrack suggested competing
networks might benefit, since viewers in those cities who
channel-surf after the games will still have prime-time programs
available on other channels versus post-game sitcom reruns on the
local Fox stations.</TE>

<HD>An enriching tribute to a tragic life</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Bill Cunliffe and the Pasadena Jazz Institute came up with an
unusually appealing presentation Saturday night at Travis Auditorium
on Fuller Theological Seminary's Pasadena campus. The concert, a
tribute to pianist Bud Powell, was called "Glass Enclosure," the
title of one of the bebop artist's thorniest works.</LD>
<LD>   But Cunliffe, who released a Powell tribute album titled "Bill
Plays Bud" in 1998, had much more to offer than his renderings of
music either written by or associated with Powell. Working with
bassist Darek Oles and drummer Joe LaBarbera, he presented what was,
in effect, a seminar with musical illustrations.</LD>
<LD>   Cunliffe was well-prepared for the task. Frequently referring to
obviously detailed notes, he offered an overview of Powell's personal
and professional life between musical segments. Given the source
material, that made for a compelling presentation on its own.</LD>
<TE>   Powell's tragic history, darkened by episodes of mental
instability and drug addiction, was the primary inspiration for the
film " 'Round Midnight." And it made for a harrowing tale, even in
Cunliffe's relatively truncated description.</TE>
<TE>   By combining Powell's real-world life story with an overview of
his musical inventions, Cunliffe underscored the enigmatic qualities
of artistic creativity, of the remarkable manner in which
extraordinary beauty can pass unfiltered through the most troubled
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   In the musical passages, Cunliffe -- an eclectic stylist who is as
convincing with ragtime as he is with bebop -- romped through such
Powell classics as "Un Poco Loco," "Hallucinations," "Tempus Fugit"
and "Sure Thing." He closed with a climactic offering of "Glass
Enclosure," a piece that represented Powell's largely unfulfilled
ambitions to deal with more expansive, classically oriented musical
elements (but with far less success than he achieved in his
straight-ahead jazz offerings).</TE>
<TE>   Capturing the essence of the Powell style -- occasionally
paraphrasing his actual solos -- Cunliffe added his own improvisatory
touches as well. He was especially effective in the supercharged
up-tempos, briskly knocking out one quick-fingered phrase after
another.</TE>
<TE>   Cunliffe's Powell presentation was an intriguingly new and
informative jazz experience -- jazz edutainment? -- and he would do
well to continue to refine it and offer it to audiences elsewhere.</TE>

<LD>You know you're in trouble when you learn that Ralph Lauren makes
paint, and your wife is telling the Korean painter -- who speaks very
little English, as opposed to the wife, who speaks perhaps too much
English -- that she wants him to go to another paint store, not the
one that sells Ralph Lauren. She wants him to match the shade of
Ralph Lauren paint at the other store, so that she doesn't have to
pay Ralph Lauren prices. Understand this one little scene and you'll
understand our life.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he knew what I was talking about," she says as the
painter stumbles off.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought you made yourself perfectly clear," I say.</LD>
<TE>   Poor painter. She has him so confused that he doesn't know whether
he's supposed to be buying paint or polo shirts. I expect him to
return wearing a Ralph Lauren pullover.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the color!" my wife will shout, pointing to his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   The painter will smile, relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "But a little less yellow," she'll say.</TE>
<TE>   And back out the door he'll go, off to buy another shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Rome wasn't renovated in a day, and neither was our little house.
The work started two years ago and continues to this day, saddled by
various work stoppages, money conflicts, miscommunications and
unplanned pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   It's like a WPA project that never ends. Inspectors knock on the
door at all hours. Workers come and workers go. Oscar. Damian. Ralph
Lauren.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the green," I say, looking through the paint chips.</TE>
<TE>   "The willow hedge?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "The green," I say.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no "green" anymore. There's Irish spurge. Kauai.
Willow hedge. Mt. Rainier. Chamois. Peony. Mexican feather grass.</TE>
<TE>   Those are all names of paints. People are paid to sit around all
day and come up with names like these, eliminating "green" from the
vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   And you can't just pick one wall color anymore. There's this
accent wall you have to paint. Never heard of an accent wall? You
will. The accent wall is where your wife determines that one wall
inside your home -- just one -- will be painted a deeper shade of
peony, or whatever color you've spent two weeks deciding on. In my
limited experience, an accent wall doubles the joy in a marriage. And
that's a lot of joy.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you pick is fine," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "But I want your help," insists my pregnant bride.</TE>
<TE>   "Like with the cabinets?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," she says, "like with the cabinets."</TE>
<TE>   There's a disaster, the cabinets. I know the cabinet guy by one
name: Efi.</TE>
<TE>   He's spoken about in the reverential tones usually reserved for
messiahs or gifted center fielders. The guy makes cabinets, for
chrissakes. In our over-designed little suburb, I guess that makes
him Willie Mays.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be so great," my wife says, looking at the new
base cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   "That Elvis sure does nice work," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Efi," she says. "His name is Efi."</TE>
<TE>   "You sure?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Pause. Because I don't believe anyone is really named Efi.</TE>
<TE>   "How come I never see this Elvis guy?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's busy," she says. "He had a kitchen on the cover of House
Magazine."</TE>
<TE>   This is the story I've heard many times, how Elvis got a kitchen
on the cover of House Magazine and suddenly he received 50 calls from
all around the world about some butcher block/center island thing
he's created. We're lucky to get Efi, I'm told. He's very much in
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, everybody is getting stuff in magazines. My friend Don
just redid a family room that is being featured on Audio Visual
Magazine. The cover, too. Puts a lot of pressure on a husband.
Shouldn't a renovation be quick, simple and private? No. Now you need
a publicist.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what Time magazine says (its own cover slathered with
renovation pictures): The kitchen has become "the home's ego, the
place where owners ... strut their stuff."</TE>
<TE>   "The kitchen can't be contained anymore, so it blends into that
live-eat-play space often called a great room... ," Time says. "The
idea is to allow family togetherness and personal space at the same
time, meaning never having to reach a consensus about what to do
together."</TE>
<TE>   That's a relief, that consensus part. The last time we reached a
consensus was on our wedding night, when we decided to wait another
few days before having kids.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a long time ago. Before Viking stoves and $2,000
refrigerators that are smarter than Socrates. If I'm going to pay
that kind of money for a fridge, I expect a trace of humility. No
ego. A humble home.</TE>
<TE>   "Men have taken to cooking and made it into a hobby and a locus of
consumption and gadgetry," design critic Thomas Hine told Time.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I still haven't found the "locus" yet, but our cabinets came
in just fine. They look OK. They look like cabinets. In a month,
they'll have scuff marks and dirty palm prints. The dog will be
licking pancake syrup from their handsome doors.</TE>
<TE>   "I love them," my wife says, caressing the naked maple.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis is a genius," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Efi," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   For a week, we discuss what color to stain the new cabinets. A
dark walnut. A light caramel. Mt. Rainier. Baked Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   We go with the cherry. Magically, the cherry stain gives the
cabinets the sheen of a brand new Rawlings baseball glove. I walk
into the kitchen and hear a playoff crowd. I smell peanuts. I hear
Adam Kennedy home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they should be lighter?" my wife wonders as the last layer
of lacquer dries.</TE>
<TE>   "No!" I yell, a playoff-caliber scream.</TE>
<TE>   And our little renovation moves on.</TE>

<HD>Marivaux's 'Love' is less than a triumph</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Triumph of Love," Marivaux's 18th century comedy about a
scheming princess who invades a hermitage and shatters the celibate
notions of its resident ascetics, is an enduring and popular trifle
that recently inspired a stage musical, as well as a film starring
Mira Sorvino and Ben Kingsley.</LD>
<LD>   Shockingly innovative in his day, Marivaux combined traditional
commedia slapstick with the impeccably rational discourse of the
Enlightenment in his splendidly subtle and wickedly entertaining
plays. The blending of those apparently opposite styles proved
jarring to audiences in Marivaux's early career, but Marivaux's
genius was soon widely acknowledged and appreciated.</LD>
<LD>   In the play's current production at A Noise Within, translation by
James Magruder, director Anne Justine D'Zmura deliberately deepens
that stylistic divide, to unfortunate effect. In certain scenes,
characters caper inanely. In others, they might as well be playing
"Hamlet."</LD>
<TE>   When all is said and done, Marivaux's play is still a comedy, one
that requires a light hand and lightning pacing. Despite that old
directorial truism about comedy being rooted in truth, it must also
be rooted in timing. Here, D'Zmura seems more intent on psychological
veracity than fun. Despite the broadly comic turns of a trio of
tricky servants, D'Zmura's tack is so unfailingly earnest, her pacing
so plodding, that the play's airy rhythms are seriously punctured. In
their evident determination not to play for cheap laughs, the actors
seldom get any laughs, cheap or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly problematic is Abby Craden's performance as Leonide,
the artful princess who, disguised as a man, invades the cloister of
the philosopher Hermocrate (Mark Bramhall) to win the heart of Agis
(Michael Matthys), Hermocrate's student and ward. Agis is the
rightful prince of the realm, whom Leonide hopes to woo, wed and
restore to his throne. But first, she has to insinuate herself into
Hermocrate's household, which she manages by seducing virtually
everyone in it, including the supposedly celibate Hermocrate and his
spinster sister Leontine (June Claman).</TE>
<TE>   For the conceit to work, Leonide must be a past mistress of the
shuck and jive, a cheerful con artist able to cook up a new stratagem
with a wink and a wiggle. Although physically striking and
self-possessed, Craden displays little of the simmering invention
that would make her dialogue more lively.</TE>
<TE>   In the brief and far breezier second act, old pros Bramhall and
Claman make the most of their comic opportunities, but by then it is
too little, too late. Thomas Buderwitz's set, Alex Jaeger's costumes
and James Taylor's lighting all start off in a somber, slate-gray
palette, then effectively transform into warmer, more vibrant hues.
Norman L. Berman's sprightly original music adds whimsy to the
otherwise joyless proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "The Triumph of Love," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd.,
Glendale. Plays in repertory through Dec. 5. Friday, 8 p.m.;
Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m.; Nov. 3, 2 and 7 p.m.; Nov. 6-8, 8 p.m.; Nov.

<HD>A living legacy endures</HD>
<DH>Gregory Ain's '40s-era low-cost housing still retains its
modern appeal. The compact but stylish design may provide a blueprint
for L.A.'s future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Freudenheim</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he sinks into a comfortable couch in his small but expansive
living room, Serril Gerber, 89, looks out through a wall of windows
at the view of the Hollywood Hills and acknowledges that he helped
make a little bit of architectural history.</LD>
<LD>   A retired schoolteacher, today he is one of just three remaining
original residents of an experiment combining low-cost housing with
high-style design. In 1946, Gerber and his late wife joined with nine
other couples who sought out Gregory Ain, a young Modernist architect
with utopian ideals.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd seen these modern houses in magazines, and we liked the idea
of having a living space that is both indoors and outdoors," Gerber
recalls. "We liked the idea of doing something really modern, and we
liked Greg. He was a radical person in his thinking, because he
wanted to put his ideas in the service of regular people. That was
his mission in life, really."</LD>
<TE>   The group knew that the homes being built in the area by Ain's
mentors, Rudolph Schindler and Richard Neutra, were out of their
reach. But in a surge of post-war optimism, they figured that by
pooling their resources and with the help of Ain's innovative design,
they could build something efficient and new.</TE>
<TE>   They found a hillside property just off Rowena Avenue in Silver
Lake, and each couple contributed about $11,000 -- enough for Ain to
build what is now known as the Avenel Terrace housing project, named
for the street on which it's located. Completed in 1948, Ain's
complex remains a model for effective use of limited space for
low-cost urban housing. But today it is more than just an example of
idealism. Interest in the mid-century style that Ain helped develop
has surged in recent years, and the units, which now sell for well
over $300,000, have become magnets for architecture buffs.</TE>
<TE>   Today, longtime residents who've filled their houses with
tchotchkes live side by side with new arrivals who prefer
uncluttered, open space. Last Sunday afternoon, six of the current
owners opened their homes for a tour for about 65 members of the
Society of Architectural Historians. Among the organizers was Richard
Corsini, an architect who has lived in the complex since 1993. The
afternoon began with lectures on Ain's work by Corsini and Anthony
Denzer, who is completing his dissertation at UCLA on the architect.</TE>
<TE>   While Ain developed many projects in Los Angeles, taught at USC
and in the mid-1960s was dean of the architecture school at Penn
State, during the last decade of his life a variety of illnesses left
him unable to work. He died in 1987 at the age of 79.</TE>
<TE>   Recognized as one of the second generation of Los Angeles'
Modernist architects, he was known more for his progressive ideas
than for his stylistic innovation. His projects span from 1928, when
he began by working with Neutra, to 1971. He may be best known
locally for a four-unit complex called Dunsmuir Flats, built in 1937
south of Wilshire Boulevard near Fairfax Avenue, and for an
innovative tract of 52 small homes he developed in Mar Vista in 1948.
The latter have attracted much notice among architecture lovers for
their distinctive siting and low-cost, efficient design.</TE>
<TE>   To those who've lived at Avenel for a long time, this new
appreciation for their homes is often a surprise. "I'm learning about
architectural people," said Betty Markoff, who has lived in one of
the units with her husband, Morrie, for the past 30 years. She
laughed as she described differences between her home and those of
her new neighbors. "They're making museums, opening everything up for
space," she said. "We're using every corner." Adds Morrie, "I just
wanted a small house that would be easy to maintain. For our way of
life, this was a good answer."</TE>
<TE>   The Avenel complex's 10 units originally were identical, each
filling only slightly more than 900 square feet. Over the years, all
but one have been extended onto the space allocated for patios, in
the process expanding the living room and master bedroom, the latter
of which now usually functions as a den. Built for families of four,
the units were meant to promote communal living, and the owners still
meet regularly to administer shared areas. (The property changed from
a cooperative to a condominium in recent years.)</TE>
<TE>   But there are changes: Children once played on the walkways in
front of the units and in a communal play yard at the back. Today,
there are no kids, the yard is a place to hide the garbage cans and
most of the new residents agree that these homes accommodate two
people, at best.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Lambert, a young architect, lives in one of the
lower-level units with Christiane Robbins, a USC assistant professor
who is making a film on Ain's work.</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved here two years ago, I didn't know much about Ain,
but when I found this place I bought it immediately," Lambert says.
"There are magical things about the space. It has no redundant
circulation and is zoned for privacy brilliantly. To see a new
generation of people come together and embrace the cooperative aspect
of living together is really special."</TE>
<TE>   All of the homes once had stand-alone kitchens, although that was
not Ain's original plan. He wanted built-in dining tables with
seating in the kitchen on one side and in the living room on the
other. They also were supposed to have an additional half-bath, which
everyone today agrees would be nice. However, the Federal Housing
Authority, which provided financing for the project, insisted that
the homes needed a broom closet more than an extra toilet or built-in
dining area, and despite a year's battle by the families, the FHA
won. Ironically, that closet has been the first thing to go in
today's redos, and in many cases, residents have installed tables
that are a close approximation of Ain's plan.</TE>
<TE>   The whole complex occupies just two 60-foot lots, each 140-feet
deep, and it appears to have retained much of its original flavor,
although the pink exterior paint Ain chose has been replaced with a
more modest white and gray palette. Yet the complex still stands out
for its modern facade on the tree-shaded street, which is lined with
a mix of Spanish-style houses and other traditional architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Ain's design consists of two rows of units, all with separate
garages -- and short driveways to accommodate second cars -- facing
onto the street. The residents also share two walkways that lead to
their front entrances, yet because each unit is staggered at a slight
angle, there is a sense of privacy that defies the tight weave of the
plan. Inside, the homes seem quite spacious -- with three bedrooms,
kitchen, living room and bath -- in part because Ain made use of
every inch of space. In addition to sliding glass doors that separate
the living room from the patios, a sliding wooden panel provides the
option of closing off the living room from the master bedroom.
Similarly, a sliding wall separates two adjacent smaller bedrooms in
the back of each unit.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Olschlager, a preservation architect, has lived at Avenel
since 1992. When he moved in, he says, "the project was on the verge
of being lost through incremental changes." Some of the changes had
been done economically, and not always with the best materials. For
example, he had to re-create the sliding doors the way Ain designed
them. But after toying with restoring other changes, such as the
enlarged living room, he left them as they were. "When you talk to
people who know Gregory Ain," Olschlager said, "they say that he
would have been comfortable with people personalizing their space."</TE>
<TE>   Corsini, too, has deliberated about how to be true to Ain while
still accommodating contemporary taste. He not only has completely
redone his own space in a stark but comfortable modern style, but
also served as architect for another unit that now has raw concrete
flooring and a ceiling stripped to expose the beams.</TE>
<TE>   However, what Corsini finds most exciting about Ain's vision is
its potential to influence future design. At a time when Los Angeles
is experiencing a severe housing shortage, Corsini points out, "these
projects are extraordinary prototypes. They are very livable spaces
that are built on a model of 14 units per acre. That's three times
the density of an average single family home."</TE>

<HD>Energized by Cuban timba</HD>
<DH>'Long John' Oliva's group moves beyond salsa-based style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juanito "Long John" Oliva is probably best known to the wider music
audience for his stirring percussion work with the guitar duo Strunz
and Farah. But the Havana-born tumbador has surfaced in a variety of
other areas since he first arrived in the United States via the 1980
Mariel boat lift. Among the highlights: a stretch with Willie Bobo
(who coined the nickname "Long John"), and performances and
recordings with Arturo Sandoval, Jackson Browne and Kenny Loggins.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday night, he brought his own group, the Long John Oliva
Afro-Cuban Timba Jazz Septet, to the Jazz Bakery. With his
seven-piece ensemble, Oliva has combined the energies of the rapidly
emerging Cuban timba style with straight-ahead jazz riffing and
extended improvisations.</LD>
<LD>   Although he largely omitted the rap element that is present in
most Cuban timba, he employed bassist Hector Ferreiro Jr. in the
freely rhythmic approach typical of the genre.</LD>
<TE>   The result was a fascinating new perspective on Latin jazz, one
that moved well beyond the locked-in rhythms and characteristic
call-and-response patterns of salsa-based jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Although Oliva and his conga drums were placed front and center,
he played an organizing, rather than a solo role. Often deferring to
Ferreiro, allowing him plenty of solo space, Oliva occasionally
signaled in his primary soloists -- the bombastic pianist Fermin
Sifontes and alto saxophonist Jose Gomez's meandering melody lines --
while driving the rhythm in combination with drummer Ariel Cuevas and
timbalero Jorge Cabonel. Soaring across the top of this simmering
musical stew, trumpeter Jeovany Valdes popped out high-note lead
lines with consummate ease.</TE>
<TE>   Occasional rough spots, both in presentation and performance,
signaled the fact that Oliva is still fine-tuning his timba-based
jazz. But the early results sounded impressive, as well as much
needed, at a time when Latin jazz must be careful to avoid the
pattern -- far too common in other areas of jazz -- of falling prey
to narrowly focused revisits to overly familiar musical arenas.</TE>

<LD>CREEPY CRAWLERS</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that most household spiders are not harmful to
people? In fact, they help our environment by eating insects. One
exception is the black widow, which is common in Los Angeles. The
black widow has a shiny black coat, long legs and a red
hourglass-shaped figure on its abdomen. A black widow's bite is
poisonous and can be fatal. These spiders like cool, dark areas such
as garages, woodpiles and space under houses. Another local spider is
the tarantula. While tropical tarantulas are venomous, bites from our
local ones are more like bee stings.</LD>
<LD>   If you find a harmless spider in your house, the zoo's reptile
curator Russ Smith recommends that you ask an adult to turn it loose
outside. Use a drinking glass or some sort of container to trap it.
If it's on the ground, a piece of paper can be used to scoop it up.</LD>
<TE>   With Halloween approaching, it's a great time to see these creepy
crawlers up close as part of the zoo's annual "Boo at the Zoo" event.
You can learn about tarantulas, millipedes, snakes, skinks,
cockroaches and more. You can also enjoy ghoulish trick-or-treat
goodies. "Boo at the Zoo" is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 26 and 27.
For more information, call (323) 644-6400 or visit www.la zoo.org.</TE>

<HD>Chaplin's big-top tension, on and off the screen</HD>
<DH>A 75th anniversary screening of 'The Circus' will feature
an orchestra playing the original score by the comic legend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the classic 1928 Charlie Chaplin comedy, "The Circus,"
screening Friday at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, is
filled with wonderful sight gags and pathos, the film's production
was a three-ring circus of delays, strife and angst.</LD>
<LD>   "It is so surrounded in misfortune," says the Little Tramp's
daughter, Geraldine Chaplin. Her father started the film in 1925
right after the release of "The Gold Rush" but didn't complete it
until 1927. Production was interrupted for nearly a year because of
"horrendous divorce" proceedings with his wife, Lita Grey.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an awful divorce," Chaplin says. "He had to stop the
production because she would have taken everything. Then his mother
died during the film, and then all the first weeks of the film where
he shot all the tightrope stuff -- the rushes came back and they were
all scratched and he had to reshoot everything."</LD>
<TE>   Then the sets burned down. "Fire destroyed everything," she says.
"Then the firemen came and then they destroyed everything that wasn't
destroyed by the fire. Then the American income tax people came and
he owed over a million in taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Chaplin says that the divorce aged her father so much that his
face changed radically from the time the film started to when
production ended. Reshoots of close-ups scheduled for the end of
production had to be canceled because of his appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to dye his hair because his hair went white," she
explains.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the problems surrounding the filming, his daughter
reports that he loved the film. "We used to show it a lot" at home.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the film's 75th anniversary celebration, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has restored "The Circus," and the
screening Friday marks the premiere of the new print. It also marks
the first time in Los Angeles that the score Chaplin wrote for "The
Circus" in 1967 will be played live. The Robert Israel Orchestra, a
25-piece ensemble, will provide the musical accompaniment with
strings, wind, brass and percussion.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Circus," Chaplin's Little Tramp joins the big top and
falls in love with a beautiful performer (Merna Kennedy). Chaplin
received a special Oscar for his "versatility and genius" at the
first Academy Awards for writing, directing and starring in the film.</TE>
<TE>   When "The Circus" was released in 1928, there was a compilation
score that went out to theaters in large towns.</TE>
<TE>   "He worked with a man named Arthur Kay to compile and arrange a
score from source materials, music from the day," Israel says. "This
apparently is what went out with the picture to some theaters. In the
1920s, because a film had a score on paper it didn't ensure it was
played at the theater. You could go to a small town and your pianist
probably couldn't read music very well and just simply improvised.
Only the large theaters would probably have the score."</TE>
<TE>   With 1931's "City Lights," Chaplin began writing the scores for
his films. One of the reasons "The Circus" doesn't have the fame of
"City Lights," "Modern Times," "The Great Dictator," "Limelight" and
"The Gold Rush," which he reissued in the early 1940s with music and
narration, was because it didn't have a score. So in 1967 at the age
of 78, he wrote a score, and in 1969 he re-released the film.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says that Chaplin's scores have a "complete uniqueness"
that are influenced by Beethoven, Mozart and Bach, as well as his
roots in English music halls.</TE>
<TE>   "Chaplin may not have been the composer in a traditional sense in
that he was musically illiterate," Israel says. "But that of course
did not stop him from being able to communicate with musicians what
he wanted and how he wanted it and to ultimately realize it.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you will have arguments from academians saying he
wasn't a real, true composer. I am one of the few who still take a
stance academically and say that is hogwash simply because if you
look at his entire output starting with 'City Lights' -- one of the
great film scores of all time -- his identity as a composer is imbued
in every one of his scores. There is no mistake when you hear music
by Chaplin."</TE>
<TE>   Israel says that the score for "The Circus" is one of the best
from his late creative period.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful score," he says. "He has very pretty melodies."</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Chaplin has warm memories of her father composing the
score on the piano at the family home in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "Those tunes, they were so beautiful," she says. "He even sings at
the beginning this love song: 'Swing little girl, swing high to the
sky.' " .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Circus" screens Friday at 8 p.m. at the Samuel Goldwyn
Theater, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Admission is $5; $3 for
academy members. For more information call (310) 247-3600.</TE>

<HD>A scripted display of debris</HD>
<DH>Tomoko Takahashi's installation is a theatrical setup that
elevates trash into a spectacle for our consideration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trash rarely looks as good as it does in Tomoko Takahashi's
"Auditorium Piece," a great tsunami of castoff stuff that cascades
down unfinished bleachers and sprawls across the stage in the
ground-floor auditorium at the UCLA Hammer Museum. The rawness of the
space, with its blunt concrete surfaces, exposed ductwork and other
coarse innards, merges effortlessly with the tons of tattered junk
the artist has piled inside to become part of the captivating scene.
Urban dystopia blends with contemporary aesthetics to create an
instant ruin--a Pompeii of the present.</LD>
<LD>   Takahashi built the work using salvage from dumpsters, alleys,
studio back lots and other sources around town, which she and a crew
of assistants gathered over several weeks. The auditorium lobby
includes scores of casual snapshots of the scavengers at work, stuck
up on the wall with blue masking tape, while a list of helpers is
scrawled in marking pen on an old projection screen nearby. Nominal
screen credits, they underscore the fundamental theatricality of the
piece.</LD>
<TE>   Inside the auditorium, visitors are kept at the top of the raking
space. A sturdy wooden railing has been erected so you can lean on
your elbows and survey the scene, with or without a helpfully
provided pair of binoculars. The setup recalls nothing so much as a
scenic overlook on an interstate highway; Takahashi's installation is
another roadside attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Natural wonders like ocean cliffs or canyon walls have been
replaced, however, by mountains of shopping carts, waves of used
tires, fields of battered electronic equipment and outcroppings of
clock faces. There are movie props of every description, a rusted
Jacuzzi, the cab of a pickup truck, lightbulbs, buckets, tin cans,
the guts of a dishwasher, a basketball hoop and thousands of other
ordinary things.</TE>
<TE>   All of it is dusted with a light "snow" of laundry detergent, like
Half Dome at Christmas. The snow puns nicely with the fuzzy,
flickering light of numerous televisions, scattered artfully
throughout the wreckage, while the oscillation of standing electric
fans keeps the air moving. Props wave gently in the man-made breeze,
like palms on a post-apocalyptic beach.</TE>
<TE>   The setup loosely recalls William Wegman's witty scenic overlook
in the Stuart Collection at UC San Diego, which turns its back on La
Jolla's stunning seaside setting to face out over the suburban sprawl
growing steadily to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Takahashi presents contemporary social scenery for our
consideration as cultural tourists. Her piece is not a documentary
harangue about a social issue -- recycle now! -- nor is it a critique
of the perils of consumption or the squalor of postindustrial
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Auditorium Piece" is instead a carefully calibrated entertainment
-- a dance of debris, a scripted display of rubbish. Her trash
performs.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblage, which critic Peter Plagens once described as "the
first home-grown California modern art," has always relied on the
theatrical possibilities latent in broken-down material goods, which
were the residue of post-World War II prosperity. Classic assemblage
tends to be melancholic, meditating on qualities of loss.</TE>
<TE>   Takahashi, by contrast, takes the sensibility to a pumped-up
extreme, which feels appropriate to our moment. It's assemblage on
steroids.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not a studio work, assembled through solitary trial and
error for later public display. International art is such today that
a typical well-established motif has an artist jetting to an
exhibition site, gathering materials in the neighborhood upon arrival
and making a new piece on deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, as with Brazilian artist Jac Leirner, the sculptural
materials consist of stuff like blankets, plastic forks and sugar
packets gathered on the airplane. Takahashi takes the theme to its
over-the-top conclusion, hauling whole dump sites over to the
friendly art museum.</TE>
<TE>   Like a "three-dimensional painting" by Jessica Stockholder, the
material in the auditorium looks carefully composed. The density of
the mass only allows individual items to reveal themselves slowly,
while their formal logic also unfolds at a leisurely pace.</TE>
<TE>   Objects are arrayed with an eye toward their relationships with
one another and with the viewpoint of the audience. The truck cab,
for example, abruptly looms out toward the spectator from the tangle
of surrounding stuff, like a postmodern Pegasus erupting in a
dramatic burst of horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   And where did that airplane fuselage suddenly come from? Like
opera-goers, we're invited to examine the spectacle and luxuriate in
its orchestration of visual excess and sensory overload.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the Tokyo-born, London-based artist -- like Wegman
and Stockholder -- was first trained as a painter, and came to
sculpture and installation art later.</TE>
<TE>   For all its Brobdingnagian tonnage, her vast assemblage work is
finally a graphic composition in which spontaneity and planned
choreography intertwine.</TE>

<HD>There is little new in the labored 'Wounded Galaxies'</HD>

<LD>Trapeze choreography has long been a special effect in concert dance,
from Mikhail Baryshnikov rocketing over the stage in Glen Tetley's
"Rite of Spring" more than a quarter-century ago, through the aerial
mysticism of ISO Dance Theatre and all those trapeze ballets in New
Age circus performances.</LD>
<LD>   At the Japan America Theatre on Saturday, Hae Kyung Lee's hourlong
"Cross the Wounded Galaxies" added nothing to this subgenre other
than a steady, slow-motion heartbeat that resolutely defied
Euro-American norms regarding dramatic structure.</LD>
<LD>   In a duet at the start of the piece and a trio at the end, Lee's
local company explored the same rudimentary trapeze vocabulary seen
this summer in a work she choreographed for the City of Los Angeles'
COLA series.</LD>
<TE>   Hanging near the floor from skeins of fabric, her dancers worked
at matching one another's moves without violating the unvarying
energy flow and funereal pace that Lee mandated.</TE>
<TE>   Their job was difficult, and it showed, with the drone of Steve
Moshier's endlessly recycled musical motifs helping reinforce the
sense of hard labor.</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of aerial choreography for a tango showcase at
the Key Club last season or the trapeze interludes in the dance
musical "Avalon" at the Doolittle Theatre in June, Lee looked like a
beginner.</TE>
<TE>   But the dancers' stamina proved exemplary in the trapeze workouts
and extended gymnastic duets midway through the piece.</TE>
<TE>   Here, again, Lee delivered tense, locked-down dancing with no
evident beginning, end or development in the choreography but a focus
on an eternal present. And very quickly, this viewer began to tune
out -- or, rather, to imagine that the collection of lifts
punctuating the duets were calligraphic codes.</TE>
<TE>   Read this way, the contorted bodies seemed to spell out such words
as "yap" and "hot," but the key image may have been their "Lee"
formation: a monument to pathological manipulation in the name of
movement design.</TE>
<TE>   A short film by Rachel Raimist showed the dancers outdoors, but
they remained a kind of trained herd -- as cornered and oppressed by
Raimist's camera as they were by Lee's choreography.</TE>
<TE>   Company members included Claudia Lopez, Miguel Olvera, Sacheen
Nehring, Jose Reynoso, Kishisa Ross and Julio Moran.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Newlyweds Liza Minnelli and David Gest have finally started taping
their first VH1 show, which will air Dec. 1. Maybe you read elsewhere
that they'd already held their first party for the show. That didn't
happen. This report even had a guest list. That didn't happen either.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, these brave ones (anyone is brave who does reality TV)
began taping last week at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem, where
Minnelli was seen singing "God Bless the Child" to a packed house.</LD>
<LD>   While there, the Gests ran into Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland
of Destiny's Child. Knowles is hot off her movie debut in "Austin
Powers in Goldmember" and busy doing another film in Atlanta. Rowland
has a No. 1 pop hit with Nelly, "Dilemma," and a solo album coming
out this month.</LD>
<TE>   It appears that these Destiny-ed girls will rejoin their other
partner, Michelle Williams, on the first "Liza and David" show.</TE>
<TE>   So, who will we actually see acting natural on the first show?
Producer now-also-performer Gest tells me he expects R&amp;B crooner
Luther Vandross; hip-hop diva Eve; Tommy Lee, who has a new band; J
Records' bestselling artist Deborah Cox; Isaac Mizrahi; Mia Farrow;
and the legendary Ray Charles, who flies in from L.A. to duet with
Liza.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the second VH1 show is taping the day before Halloween, and
it boasts another who's who of guest stars, including Bobby "Boris"
Pickett and the Crypt-Kicker Five, who plan to reunite for the
original "Monster Mash."</TE>

<HD>Newscasts too often employ scare tactics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the just-released film "Bowling for Columbine," director Michael
Moore applies his pell-mell, guerrilla-filmmaking style to examining
why Americans seem to love guns and so frequently shoot one another.
Along the way, his accusing lens points at everything from the
National Rifle Assn. to the national psyche.</LD>
<LD>   Amid Moore's scattershot theories, however, one squarely nails its
target -- namely, the nightly news' role in making the public more
frightened than it should be, contributing to some people feeling the
need to arm themselves to the teeth. Because for all the talk about
taking a higher road post-Sept. 11, TV news relies more heavily than
ever on cheap scare tactics -- particularly in its promotion -- as a
means of getting viewers to tune in.</LD>
<LD>   The rap on local TV news has always been its "If it bleeds, it
leads" mind-set. Yet in an age when sniper killings and anthrax
mailings instantly yield their own slickly packaged graphics, an
equally valid description might be "If it scares, we care."</LD>
<TE>   For TV news, the allure of "This could happen to you" stories is
intoxicating, the latest case study being coverage of the recent
sniper shootings near Washington, D.C. As terrible as those reports
are, they pale compared to the number of murders seen almost nightly
in an average big-city newscast, the difference here being the
maddening randomness of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Koppel conceded as much on Friday's "Nightline," observing
that the media were "going nuts" over what he correctly characterized
as a "dreadful but relatively minor threat" in the bigger scheme of
things.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it's not just those incorrigible local newscasts that
succumb to such excess. Consider a report from the Washington,
D.C.-based Center for Media and Public Affairs tabulating how network
news coverage of child abductions soared this summer thanks to a few
high-profile cases, despite FBI data indicating that such kidnappings
are actually down this year.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing those statistics, you certainly wouldn't think
that's the case from watching TV news, just as a casual observer
would have doubtless assumed there was a shark-attack epidemic the
year before. In releasing its findings, center President Robert
Lichter concluded, "As much as we thought the media changed after
9/11, their obsession with kidnappings shows a reversion to form."</TE>
<TE>   Strictly from a business standpoint, this is understandable. After
all, what could be more horrifying to parents in the
advertiser-friendly 25-to-54 age demographic, who are more likely to
have young children, than the threat of someone snatching kids? In
that respect, child abductions are the perfect made-for-TV news
story, as is anything that can be teased "Your children could be in
danger. Find out at 11," from asbestos in schools to razor blades in
parks and playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, reviewing the damning images in Moore's
comedy-documentary-propaganda piece -- including his chat with NRA
President Charlton Heston and ambush interview of Dick Clark --
nothing matches the one shot capturing these priorities, as TV news
crews form a lemming-like line outside a Michigan funeral home that
houses the body of a 6-year-old murder victim.</TE>
<TE>   Academics refer to the cumulative effect of this numbing drumbeat
as the "mean world syndrome," positing that heavy TV viewers see the
world -- including their own community -- as being more violent and
fearful than it really is.</TE>
<TE>   Among the fatuous pronouncements often made about the correlation
between media and societal violence, this theory has the benefit of
making the most intuitive sense -- and it's supported by research
showing that people who watch lots of TV tend to overestimate their
chances of being victimized.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the tricks of the trade exist for a reason. Even for
media-savvy viewers, it's difficult not to pause when flipping past
Fox News Channel or CNN and seeing "News Alert" plastered across the
screen -- prompting a momentary "Oh no, what now?" hiccup before one
realizes the "alert" as often as not refers to something that
happened the day before.</TE>
<TE>   In short, news operates the way it does because human nature makes
us vulnerable to its basest ploys. So close-to-home perils will
always trump faraway ones, and a faraway threat becomes more
compelling if it can be prefaced "Could it happen here?" or promoted
as "What you don't know" can hurt or kill you.</TE>
<TE>   Forget snakes and high places. To TV news directors, this is the
true "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   As the "mean world" turns, it doesn't help, either, that prime
time has become one big crime blotter, including three editions of
NBC's "Law &amp; Order." This logjam makes crafting fresh story lines no
small feat and may explain why "Special Victims Unit" opened its
season with a female serial killer, a real-life phenomenon that
occurs as frequently as the Anaheim Angels reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, CBS has television's top-rated show now in
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and added four new crime dramas this
fall, among them the spinoff "CSI: Miami" and near-spinoff "Without a
Trace." The latter, focusing on the FBI's missing persons unit, has
already featured an episode in which a pedophile lures an 11-year-old
boy from home via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In a nutshell, crime pays. And while it's unlikely "CSI" will make
you want to shoot your neighbor, it isn't an illogical leap to
speculate that viewing enough of it might make that stranger
approaching on a darkened street seem more apt to mean you harm.</TE>
<TE>   October has always been a time for fright-fests, with Halloween
providing inspiration for a host of eerie documentaries and movie
marathons. Still, if you want a scare sure to keep the kids huddled
under their bedsheets year-round, just pick up the remote and look
for someone sitting behind a desk at 5, 6 or 11.</TE>

<HD>Will Madonna stop the act?</HD>
<DH>Even supporters wonder whether it's time for the Queen of
Pop to cede her movie fiefdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the cover story in October's Vanity Fair, Madonna has
written a children's book. This is not a good sign. For one thing,
celebrity children's books are so last Thursday and, John Lithgow's
notwithstanding, they invariably signal a certain stage in a person's
career, a luftpause often filled by publicists' comments about
"taking stock" and "rethinking priorities."</LD>
<LD>   Part of this is logistics -- it's hard to be concerned with much
when starring in a red-hot TV show or sold-out concert -- but what
can it mean that the Queen of Pop is following in the footsteps of
Jamie Lee Curtis? Perhaps the same thing it meant for Jamie Lee
Curtis -- the movie thing is not going so well.</LD>
<LD>   To say that "Swept Away," her recent film done in collaboration
with new husband-director Guy Ritchie, is not doing well is like
saying Ken Lay has had a bad fourth quarter. Never has the word
"stink" appeared in so many typefaces across so many mediums.</LD>
<TE>   "Soggy and superfluous" said the New York Times, calling the film
a rare opportunity to "feel sorry for Madonna." "The kind of bad
movie that only talented people make," countered the Chicago Tribune,
"a colossal misfire." "How about 'Stay Away'?' opened E!Online's
review. Rolling Stone called it a shipwreck.</TE>
<TE>   (Already rumors are spreading of a Vanity Fair curse -- just as
bagging the cover of Sports Illustrated has heralded disaster for
more than a few athletes, the coveted VF cover has become a sometimes
dicey deal -- remember "Pearl Harbor's" Josh Hartnett? Neither do
we.)</TE>
<TE>   Opening in 196 theaters, "Swept Away" managed to bring in just
$354,000, slightly less than Adam Sandler's new movie, which played
on five screens.</TE>
<TE>   It's gotten so bad that Liz Rosenberg, the star's publicist, took
to the New York Post to stop the insanity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a public hanging," she said, "an assassination. Stop being
so mean!"</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Mrs. Ritchie nee Ciccione is used to bad reviews. She's
gotten them for every movie she has ever made -- 16 of them, mind you
(not counting the many films in which she played herself) -- with the
single exception of her first, "Desperately Seeking Susan." And she
just came off a limited London engagement of "Up for Grabs," which
drew mostly negative notices.</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, the woman cannot act. And unlike some of her
initially wooden peers who went on to achieve excellent performances
-- Farah Fawcett comes to mind, as does Cher -- she seems incapable
of learning on the job. So the question is not, Why is everyone being
so mean? It's, Why does Madonna keep doing this?</TE>
<TE>   Things have gotten so bad that even longstanding Madonna champion
Camille Paglia is concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Madonna is a dancer and musician, not an actress," the author
said in an e-mail interview. "She has no ear whatever for speech --
hence, subtle vocal inflections escape her. This is partly because
she has no conversational skill. In every social occasion, she must
flirt, dominate or act up like a teenager. She's too restless to sit
and talk."</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior can be played as "caged panther" in one's 20s and
even 30s, but by 40, it's starting to look more like a tic or a
mental affliction.</TE>
<TE>   "Madonna is in frenetic circus mode," Paglia said, "as shown by
that awful 'Drowned World' tour, which threw everything at the
audience but the kitchen sink. The jerky, manic 'Swept Away' suffers
from the same problem -- Madonna and Guy Ritchie seem to confuse art
with attention-deficit disorder."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly anyone watching the star's recent interview with Larry
King might have a few similar reactions. King himself has a bad
relationship with the noun-verb-noun construct, but scanning the
transcript, one is hard pressed to find a complete thought, or
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   King: So remake -- why do a remake?</TE>
<TE>   Madonna: Well, we didn't intend to make a remake, and I don't -- I
think Guy probably said in one of his interviews he'd never do a
remake of a movie. But we saw it together and he -- and I don't know.
It just somehow evolved and he ended up wanting to make it. He
thought it would be great as a remake. He thought he could do
something</TE>
<TE>   King: Something that wasn't done ...</TE>
<TE>   Madonna: Yes. Yes. I thought, I, he thought -- I think he thought
he could make it more modern and funnier. It is a great story. The
premise of the story is great.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Early success is always risky and Madonna has been better than
most at reinventing herself to accommodate the voracious appetite of
an easily bored demographic. But dancing around in your underwear and
having sex with a lot of people is essentially a young person's
sport, and if the film career is a dead-end, then perhaps it's time
to genuinely reflect.</TE>
<TE>   For most of us, it would seem an excellent time for retirement,
for seeing the world from a vantage point other than a stage. But the
woman who famously refuses to take a vacation is probably not going
to cash out at 45. Still, maybe it is time for some real reflection.</TE>
<TE>   Paglia would like to see her get off "this crazed, workaholic,
sleep-deprived express train she's been on her whole professional
life" and concentrate on her music. "The number of major songs that
Madonna has contributed to world music is staggering. That great
talent ... has nothing to do with looks and, therefore, will not age
with her."</TE>
<TE>   But according to career consultant Kenneth Blanchard, it is time
for Madonna to make a bigger change, to move from success to
significance. For too long, she has defined her self-worth by her
performance and what other people think about her, says the co-author
of the life-changes book "Who Moved My Cheese."</TE>
<TE>   It's time for her to move past the Grammys and the Golden Globes,
the platinum records and multimillion-dollar homes. "The opposite of
success is generosity; the opposite of recognition is service; the
opposite of power and status is loving relationships," said Blanchard
in soothing tones. "She could take up where Princess Diana left off.
[Madonna] has such a following: Think of how much she could do for
the world. We have enough of greed and success. You become an adult
when you realize you are not here to get, you're here to give."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Madonna should have a little sit-down with Cher, who if
nothing else, has proven that a successful acting career does not
necessarily lead to happiness, or even good business sense. Still,
Cher recently announced she is retiring from the music business,
about five minutes past not a minute too soon.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine: A world with no new Cher songs or Madonna movies. A world
swept away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A selected movie scorecard:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Desperately Seeking Susan" (1985)</TE>
<TE>   Madonna played Susan, a free-spirited, bangled, braceleted rock
star and object of Rosanna Arquette's envious desire. It brought
Madonna, director Susan Seidelman and the black lace bustier as
outerwear out of the dive-club scene into the zeitgeist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Tracy" (1990)</TE>
<TE>   After she played torch singer Breathless Mahony, many fans were
shocked to learn that not only couldn't Madonna act, she really
couldn't sing all that well either.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Evita" (1996)</TE>
<TE>   After years of hype, the film version of this musical was
anti-climactic at best. Although Madonna won a Golden Globe, the only
remarkable aspect of her performance was the fact that she had,
through the miracle of modern contact lenses, brown eyes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Next Best Thing" (2000)</TE>
<TE>   Madonna's portrayal of a yoga instructor who sort of accidentally
gets pregnant by her gay best friend underwhelmed audiences and
proved that even the chiseled features of Rupert Everett can't save a
film from instant obscurity.</TE>

<CX>   Madonna -- An Oct. 16 Calendar story on Madonna's acting career
incorrectly identified Kenneth Blanchard as the co-author of "Who
Moved My Cheese." Blanchard wrote only the book's foreword, Spencer
Johnson wrote the book. Also in some copies of Calendar, Madonna's
last name was misspelled. It is Ciccone.</CX>

<HD>Gomez hones its friendly rock fusion</HD>

<LD>The members of Gomez landed their space-rock ship on the House of
Blues stage Monday, and out popped a friendly swirl of blues,
country, psychedelia and jazz that sounded thoroughly modern while
evoking classic touchstones.</LD>
<LD>   The British sextet's music vaguely recalled Little Feat, the
Grateful Dead and Moby Grape, but also shared a glancing kinship with
such contemporaries as Beachwood Sparks, Counting Crows and the North
Mississippi Allstars.</LD>
<LD>   The group has been honing its organically trippy music since
winning the U.K.'s coveted Mercury Music Prize for its 1998 debut
album, "Bring It On."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the first of two consecutive nights at the West
Hollywood club, Gomez highlighted its third album, "In Our Gun," and
also played older works.</TE>
<TE>   With each collection, the members have honed their fusion of blues
rock, jam-band music and country rock.</TE>
<TE>   As on the recordings, in concert the players traded instruments
and shared vocal duties among three musicians, always casual in
manner yet musically precise.</TE>
<TE>   They never lapsed into tedious expansiveness, despite one overly
cerebral number that veered on a dime from driving rock to plodding
jazz.</TE>
<TE>   More enjoyable were such wryly progressive numbers as "Sound of
Sounds," which blended fun electronic noises with the more
conventional guitars, keyboards, bass, drums and percussion.</TE>
<TE>   Exhorting the audience with handclaps and witty banter, the band
would have been right at home in an arena.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the crowd's enthusiastic response, Gomez may yet end up
in one.</TE>

<LD>A dapper Rod Stewart stepped from the limousine, adjusted his
pinstriped suit and greeted the waiting cameras, with his girlfriend,
Penny Lancaster, two blond daughters and their new friend, Jack
Osbourne, in tow. There was just time enough outside the St. Regis
Hotel in Century City for a few sound bites before the Monday night
record release party.</LD>
<LD>   "This is big," said Stewart, shifting his weight. "It's very big.
This, I've never done before." Lancaster beamed at the cameras and
demonstrated the gravity of the evening by showing off her shoes:
"I've got on a low heel so I wouldn't be taller than him!"</LD>
<LD>   Then the Stewart entourage was off, past the check-in table (the
singer announced himself as he walked past attendants), past
photographers and then a pause for a witty exchange with reporters.
Inspiration, he told them, requires "lots of sex and lots of wine."</LD>
<TE>   Inside, Stewart was awaited by hundreds of people sipping wine and
crowding around the Asian food buffet. Record label executives, old
friend Robbie Robertson, producer Lawrence Bender and novelist Jackie
Collins were there, all of them eager to experience Stewart's latest
incarnation: the Crooner.</TE>
<TE>   The party was hosted by J Records' chairman Clive Davis to
celebrate the singer's first release for the label, "It Had to Be You
... The Great American Songbook," which includes pop standards like
Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' "The Way You Look Tonight." (Early
this year, Stewart announced his departure from Warner Music Group,
which he has said treated him like "an old piece of furniture.")</TE>
<TE>   Due out Tuesday, the record features 14 American pop standards,
among them George and Ira Gershwin's "They Can't Take That Away From
Me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC and producer Steven Bochco have reached an agreement renewing
"NYPD Blue" for an 11th season extending into 2004, the parties
announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say ABC had sought to reduce the license fee the network
pays to broadcast the cop show, which has exhibited admirable
endurance at the start of its 10th year. It's currently averaging 13
million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, but ABC has reportedly
renewed the series for close to its current fee, which is said to be
about $3.5 million an episode, still less than the network pays for
its other most-watched drama, "The Practice."</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Franz, the lone remaining original cast member, already has
agreed to an additional year. Bochco is preparing a futuristic police
series for the Fox network, tentatively scheduled to premiere next
season.</TE>

<LD>Richard Harris, who stars as Albus Dumbledore in the "Harry Potter"
movies, has been hospitalized in London after treatment for cancer,
his agent said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran Irish actor fell ill in August after shooting the
second film in the series, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"
and went to a hospital with a severe chest infection, said his London
agent, Sharon Thomas. She said the 72-year-old has been at University
College Hospital for two months, where he's had a course of
chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas said Harris is due to be released soon and would be
available for the third movie based on author J.K. Rowling's boy
wizard.</LD>

<LD>Shania Twain fans may get two CDs for the price of one when her "Up!"
album is released on Nov. 19. Twain's husband and producer, Robert
John "Mutt" Lange, reportedly is considering putting out two versions
of the 19-song album, one disc with the songs mixed to emphasize the
country elements, another with pop-oriented mixes.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Mercury Records said that nothing is official
yet, but if it is released as a two-CD set, it would sell for the
same price as a single CD.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy, which appears to be unprecedented from a major
artist, would assure fans who buy "Up!" of getting the version of
songs they hear on the radio, whether they were listening to a
country or a pop station.</LD>
<TE>   It might also help Twain avoid alienating country radio
programmers and fans while still courting her pop audience.</TE>

<HD>Ambrose told the stories from history that we needed to
hear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, much of the American press is more often than necessary a
school for scandal. Hence, the begrudging quality of so many of the
obituaries for historian Stephen Ambrose, who died this week at 66.</LD>
<LD>   While The Times and other major newspapers took a balanced
approach to the best-selling writer's remarkably prolific career, the
more common journalistic template looked something like this: a first
paragraph recording his death; a second paragraph noting that he was
a longtime smoker and died of lung cancer (in other words, he brought
it on himself); and finally, a third paragraph recounting the
allegations of plagiarism leveled against him over a few frenzied
weeks earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Globe went so far as to report the charges as facts.
Ambrose, the paper, wrote, "drew widespread attention ... over
revelations that he had plagiarized a number of brief passages in at
least five of his books." To its credit, the Globe went on to report
that in every instance, Ambrose had cited the source of the allegedly
appropriated passage in his end notes. It also quoted the historian's
initial response to the allegations:</LD>
<TE>   "I always thought plagiarism meant using other people's words and
ideas, pretending they were your own and profiting from it. I do not
do that, never have done that and never will."</TE>
<TE>   Quite right. And Ambrose never did.</TE>
<TE>   What he did do on about 10 of the roughly 15,000 pages he
published was paraphrase brief passages and borrow direct historical
quotations from previously published works. Those books were cited
without exception among the more than 24,000 footnotes arrayed
throughout his books.</TE>
<TE>   All synoptic, narrative historians, which is what Ambrose was,
paraphrase from other sources. If the standards laid down by his most
rabid critics were applied to the four Evangelists, the three
Synoptic Gospels would have to be denounced as acts of plagiarism--as
would a substantial and revered part of the extant medieval corpus.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that the first writer to record a fact, quote a
conversation or uncover a letter somehow owns that moment in time
entirely and forever reduces historical scholarship to a kind of
intellectual land rush.</TE>
<TE>   It also makes the composition of readable historical narratives
all but impossible. Ambrose, in fact, was part of a new generation of
vigorous narrative historians, including David McCullough, Doris
Kearns Goodwin and Joseph Ellis, who have made writerly works on
serious historical subjects a fixture on bestseller lists during the
past few years. (The problems surrounding the latter two involve
issues wholly separate from those considered here.)</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose is due particular credit for giving the individual stories
of the average men whose collective effort defeated fascism the epic
treatment they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Publisher Max Rudin, whose Library of America has collected the
work of Francis Parkman, the archetypal American narrator, believes
the new synoptic historians have responded to a deep public hunger.</TE>
<TE>   "After Francis Parkman's time in the 19th century, academic
history moved toward the monograph and away from narrative
storytelling," Rudin said. "First movies and then television picked
up that popular narrative function. But, by the '50s and '60s, a
serious gap had opened. There was no well-written, intelligent
history for a broad audience. Academics had become more specialized,
and other storytelling media began to dumb down the subject. It was
this lack that these popular historians have helped fill."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, there is something crabbed and small-minded
about reducing the life of a historian whose work elevated not only
the bestseller lists, but also contemporary cinema to hair-splitting
over a handful of paraphrases and footnotes in a 36-volume career.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the plagiarism allegations surfaced, Ambrose told an
interviewer that even as a classroom teacher, his approach differed
"from the way most academics teach history." He said he wanted his
students to know more about Thomas Jefferson than his relationship
with Sally Hemmings. "I want them to know that Thomas Jefferson wrote
the Virginia Statute of Religious Liberty."</TE>
<TE>   Most of his colleagues, he said, simply "teach that Jefferson had
a slave mistress and that George Washington was a slaveholder. I want
them to know that George Washington led us in war and in peace. In
war, he knew if he was captured they were going to send him to
London. They were going to put him on trial. They were going to find
him guilty of treason, and then they were going to draw and quarter
him. I make sure those kids know what drawing and quartering means."</TE>
<TE>   The Library of America's Rudin, who reads not only academic
histories, but also the work of popular historians--"whenever I'm
interested in their subject"--thinks the renewed interest in writerly
histories of Ambrose's sort represents a salutary shift in popular
taste. "When historical investigations are written for a general
audience," he said, "there is inevitably a back-and-forth over the
story as presented and challenges to its factual and interpretive
content. Frankly, there's no harm in that.</TE>
<TE>   "The dramatic return to narrative history that has occurred over
the past few years speaks to people's need to have a coherent and
compelling story to tell themselves and each other about their common
past and their relationship to it. I think authors like David
McCullough and Stephen Ambrose have filled that need to our people's
great benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose's own plain-spoken verdict on the plagiarism controversy
was reported last May in The Times' story on his fatal illness:
"Screw it," he said. "I don't know that I'm all that good at
academics. I'm a writer."</TE>

<LD>The story so far: Harley's teacher has made a homework assignment. He
must draw a picture of someone in his family doing what he or she
likes to do best, and he doesn't know where to start.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Any time I have a problem I can always ask Gramma.</LD>
<TE>   She's kind of old, but she has lots of good ideas. She listens and
then makes little comments like, "How splendid!" or "That's cool" or,
sometimes, "Bummer!" Then she stares me right in the eye and says,
"OK. What are you going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how it happens, but after talking with Gramma I
always seem to find a way to solve my problem or at least make it a
littler problem.</TE>
<TE>   I went to see her right after school. She was in her in her
backyard planting seeds for her vegetable garden.</TE>
<TE>   "Harley, what a surprise!" she said when I opened the gate. "Come
here, child, give me a hug! How come I'm so lucky to have you stop by
for a visit?"</TE>
<TE>   I told her about my homework assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Gramma said, "How splendid! You actually have homework! That's
really cool."</TE>
<TE>   "But, what can I do?" I asked. "I can't draw anything."</TE>
<TE>   She put on her glasses and stared right into my eyes. "Of course
you can draw. Everybody can draw."</TE>
<TE>   "Not me!" I said.</TE>
<TE>   She cocked her head. "Can you draw a circle?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, sure," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "What about a square? Can you draw that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Gramma said, "There you have it!"</TE>
<TE>   "Have what?" I asked. "Gramma, I don't know what you mean."</TE>
<TE>   "Think about it a while," she said, "I'll get us some lemonade and
something special I just baked."</TE>
<TE>   I followed her into the house wondering what circles and squares
had to do with anything.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: Circles and squares?</TE>

<HD>They mold the characters while staying true to script</HD>
<DH>The 18th Artios Awards honors casting directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though they don't receive Oscars or Golden Globes, casting directors
do get to honor their own every year. Thursday, the Casting Society
of America is presenting its 18th annual Artios Awards for excellence
in casting in 17 categories at a gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel
hosted by actor Orlando Jones. Awards will be handed out to casting
directors in film, television and theater.</LD>
<LD>   In conjunction with the honors, we asked two veteran casting
directors, one from film and the other primarily from television, to
offer insights into the casting process.</LD>
<LD>   Jane Jenkins: Nominated with her partner, Janet Hirschenson, for
casting "A Beautiful Mind" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone."</LD>
<TE>   Appearance vs. talent: "It is and always has been based on what
the material is. You start with the script and you build a cast on a
number of things. Yes, there are times when you are looking for a
certain look or a certain quality, but at the end of the day you are
always looking for the right actor.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the budget, you have the latitude of hiring big,
famous stars -- and sometimes you don't. On "A Beautiful Mind," it
was not an enormously big-budgeted movie. They already had Russell
Crowe, and they needed a terrific cast, and they didn't have the
money [for more big stars], so we took a chance and found some new,
young actors in Paul Bettany and Josh Lucas, and they still haven't
stopped working. Jennifer Connelly, who is not a new actress but
certainly sort of is just coming into her own, wound up with an
Academy Award, and that's the thrill of it all."</TE>
<TE>   The influx of British, Australian and New Zealand actors: "I think
the business has become very global, and as a casting director you
really have to be aware of actors in a global way that you never had
to before. The thing about the Brits, Aussies and Kiwis is that they
all have -- or a great many of them have -- an extraordinary ability
to handle dialect.</TE>
<TE>   I think a majority of these people who come from the other side of
the pond are far better trained than the majority of young American
actors, with the exception of people who go to proper schools like
Yale Drama or go through a course of real study. A lot of young
American actors are limited because they go to an acting class here
and there and they learn about being realistic and true to
themselves, but when it comes to dressing in a costume and creating a
character larger than their own life, they don't always have the
technique to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Cami Patton: Nominated with her partner, Meg Liberman, for
miniseries for "Band of Brothers" and independent film for "My Big
Fat Greek Wedding." They also cast CBS' "King of Queens," Fox's
"Grounded for Life" and NBC's "Boomtown."</TE>
<TE>   Appearance vs. talent: "Often there are restrictions on a role and
someone has to be good-looking or beautiful or attractive or
whatever, but more often it is really about what makes the role work.</TE>
<TE>   When I started [1979] in regular episodic television, you would
have a lot of studio and network input on the pilot. Once you go to
the series, pretty much the producers ran the show. [Now,] there is
considerably more involvement from the studio and the work level on
an episode-to-episode basis -- and, you know, it feels in reality
like the stakes are higher."</TE>
<TE>   The influx of British, Australian and New Zealand actors: "I
think, in television, it sort of becomes the usual suspects to a
degree. You know, it is when almost every show that's developed has
that 30- to 35-year-old leading man -- that has gotten very hard to
find. It's harder to find somebody new here ... who can carry a lead
in a series. What happens is that the minute you start looking at a
place like Australia or England, you have a huge talent pool that we
haven't over-accessed, [people] that do have enough behind them to be
able to do those kind of roles."</TE>

<HD>Gala samples Richard Rodgers' rich body of work for
Broadway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hey, Barry Manilow: Richard Rodgers wrote the songs.</LD>
<LD>   With lyricists Lorenz Hart and, later, Oscar Hammerstein II,
Rodgers reinvented musical theater and crafted some of the world's
most enduring tunes. Just ask the folks in line for "Oklahoma!,"
which is back on Broadway in its latest revival.</LD>
<LD>   "On Stage at the Kennedy Center: The Richard Rodgers Gala," hosted
by Shirley Jones and airing tonight at 8 on KCET and KVCR, toasts the
centennial year of the composer's birth with a one-hour musical
showcase featuring Broadway stars from several eras performing his
songs. Rodgers, born June 28, 1902, in New York City, died in 1979.</LD>
<TE>   Like a greatest-hits album, this kind of sweeping, sampling show,
taped at a Washington concert earlier this year, could never capture
the richness of Rodgers' work. Clips from "The King and I" and other
movies remind us of how his songs weaved slyly sophisticated stories
and transported us to another place.</TE>
<TE>   But fans are sure to find this an enchanting evening. Highlights
include Rita Moreno's wistful rendition of "This Nearly Was Mine"
from "South Pacific" and Audra McDonald's convincing "I Have
Confidence" from "The Sound of Music."</TE>
<TE>   Less satisfying is Kristin Chenoweth's take on "My Funny
Valentine" from "Babes in Arms."</TE>
<TE>   She belts out a song more suited to the restrained stylings of
Chet Baker, even Elvis Costello.</TE>
<TE>   All is forgiven when Chenoweth and the other stars join in on an
appropriately rousing finale, the title number from "Oklahoma!" You
can almost feel the wind blowing in from the plain, for this is music
that doesn't just feel good--it feels right.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" finding another ratings high,
CBS has now won the first three weeks of the new TV season in overall
viewing while NBC remains the only network in close pursuit, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS is being paced by its strength Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays
as well as the surprise success of the new drama "Hack" on Friday
nights. The network's Sunday movie continues to struggle, with
disappointing tune-in for "Gleason."</LD>
<LD>   NBC remains the clear-cut leader in the young-adult demographics
sought by advertisers, but experienced a few areas of concern.
Tune-in for its new drama "American Dreams" dropped from the previous
week and "The West Wing" slipped to its lowest rating since its first
season as ABC's "The Bachelor" and the WB's "Birds of Prey" siphoned
younger viewers.</LD>
<TE>   "Just Shoot Me" also misfired, kicking off its seventh season
opposite ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" and
"JAG." On the plus side for NBC, "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent"
appears to be solidifying its hold at 9 p.m. Sunday -- a slot made
more challenging by HBO's "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   With solid ratings for "Birds" and its Tuesday tandem of
"Smallville" and "Gilmore Girls," viewing of the WB rose 20% compared
with the corresponding week a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Fox postpones 'Phone Booth' because of sniper attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After another fatal sniper shooting near the nation's capital, 20th
Century Fox announced Tuesday that it is postponing the release of
its film "Phone Booth," a suspense thriller about a sniper who
threatens a man who answers a ringing telephone in a booth on a New
York sidewalk.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of recent events, we are delaying the release of the
movie," said Fox spokeswoman Flo Grace, who declined to comment
further.</LD>
<LD>   Fox had been preparing a Nov. 15 nationwide launch for the film,
but the company now isn't expected to release the film until next
year.</LD>
<TE>   Directed by Joel Schumacher, "Phone Booth" stars Colin Farrell as
a man targeted by an unseen sniper who threatens to kill him if he
hangs up.</TE>
<TE>   The studio's decision came hours after the real-life
Washington-area sniper killed his ninth victim, a 47-year-old woman
and mother of two grown children who was gunned down outside a Home
Depot store in Falls Church, Va. The victim worked as a computer
crimes analyst for the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, screenwriter Larry Cohen, who spent three years
developing the script for "Phone Booth," said he would have no
objection if Fox delayed the film, calling the fictional account "an
excursion into dark reality" given current news events.</TE>

<KH>THE CALIFORNIA COOK</KH>
<HD>A way as fresh as the seasons</HD>
<DH>At its heart, California cuisine begins with the best
ingredients and makes sure nothing is lost on the way to the table.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California cuisine has taken more than its share of shots over the
years, getting blamed for everything from the latest fusion travesty
to sprouts. Those of us who live and cook here know that it really
means something quite different. The problem has been coming up with
an exact definition.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a matter of geography -- there are restaurants in
California that don't qualify and there are restaurants in Manhattan
that do. Nor does it come down to quality. Many of the best
restaurants in the state don't belong to the club and I wouldn't eat
at many of the places that do.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, California cuisine is an aesthetic, a collection of
artistic principles. These discussions of sensibility can get
complicated, but basically, it boils down to this: Get good
ingredients and get out of their way.</LD>
<TE>   As diverse as the world of cooking is, it can be broken down into
two main schools: The first emphasizes the ingredients and the other
transforms them into something else. California cuisine belongs to
the first. In California cuisine, you rarely are left wondering, "How
in the world did they do that?"</TE>
<TE>   If you're at a restaurant that offers a fresh peach for dessert,
you're probably in California cuisine country. This is definitely
true if that peach bears a varietal tag and the name of the farmer
who grew it. California cuisine is very big on provenance.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if that same peach is cut into perfect
quarter-inch-thick horizontal slices and then put back together with
layers of raspberry sorbet and perfectly cut almond tuiles, no matter
how delicious that dessert might be, you're in transformation land.</TE>
<TE>   Pure sophistication</TE>
<TE>   This simplicity makes some people crazy. I remember sitting at
lunch several years ago with Alice Waters when a prominent French
winemaker lectured her for hours on the errors of her ways. "This is
not cooking," he kept insisting. "It is arranging."</TE>
<TE>   But wiser heads won't mistake simplicity for lack of creativity.
When Charles and Henry Greene forsook Victorian ornamentation on
their bungalows and when Gustav Stickley stripped his furniture of
finish, they didn't do it because they didn't know better.</TE>
<TE>   That is no idle comparison. Chez Panisse, the fountainhead of
California cuisine, is housed in a converted Craftsman bungalow and
is steeped in the Arts and Crafts aesthetic. At its core, that
celebration of nature and of the importance of beauty in daily life
fits hand in glove with this style of cooking.</TE>
<TE>   There is another similarity between the two movements -- an
accessibility to the public at large. Just as Craftsman bungalows
were originally envisioned not as mansions but as housing for working
families, the principles of California cuisine are perfectly adapted
for cooking at home.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in large part that's where they come from. The
inspirations for California cuisine come not from the magicians of
the kitchen, but from the "old stoves," the best home cooks.</TE>
<TE>   What started all of this pondering is Judy Rodgers' wonderful new
"The Zuni Cafe Cookbook." In fact, the next time someone asks you for
a definition of California cuisine, you can shortcut the whole
argument just by handing them a copy. Though many have addressed the
topic from various angles (especially good are the various Chez
Panisse cookbooks), this is the best single volume on the subject
I've found.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Rodgers' roots are firmly in French home
cooking. Although she lived for a year as a teenager with France's
Troisgros family, there are no recipes from their three-star
restaurant -- not a single salmon with sorrel to be found. But there
are several she learned at the family dining table. For the most part
there is little in "The Zuni Cafe" that any moderately skilled home
cook couldn't make -- and not just for the occasional celebration,
but for everyday meals as well.</TE>
<TE>   A bite of reality</TE>
<TE>   There was a silly article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of
weeks ago trying to prove that it was cheaper to eat at restaurants
than it was to cook at home. Aside from the Enron accounting that was
used (wouldn't you think the purchase of a bottle of olive oil should
be amortized over the life of the product rather than taken as a
one-time charge?), I couldn't help but wonder how different the story
would have turned out had they cooked from Rodgers' book.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, what about some sliced coppa with a quick celery root
pickle, roast chicken with bread-and-tomato salad, then plum sorbet
for dessert? A wonderful seasonal home dinner for four for less than
$20. And no tricky techniques or exotic ingredients involved.</TE>
<TE>   Better than the cuisine, though, is the writing -- and how many
restaurant cookbooks can you say that about? Even the recipes are a
joy to read. Instead of the usual process (check the title, read the
headnote, scan the ingredients), you'll find yourself following them
all the way through to make sure you don't miss a hint or a nuance.</TE>
<TE>   Begin reading it and you'll be swept up in the pleasure of
listening to someone who not only is passionately interested in her
subject, but someone who can actually write about it well.</TE>
<TE>   Like the cooking it describes, you won't even realize how artfully
it's constructed until you start to pick it apart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Savory onion tart</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: These recipes are from Judy Rodgers' "The Zuni Cafe
Cookbook" (Norton, $35). This is a perfect example of a simple recipe
with a great payoff. It's nothing more than caramelized onions on top
of a rough puff pastry, but the combination of the sweetness and
nearly creamy texture of the topping and the crunchy, browned-wheat
flavor of the base is profoundly delicious. On top of that, you get
one of the easiest puff pastry recipes you'll ever find.</TE>
<TE>   1 recipe rough puff pastry (right)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons mild-tasting</TE>
<TE>   olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 pound thinly sliced onions (about 3 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   Sprig of fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1. Thaw the dough in the refrigerator if frozen, then leave at
room temperature long enough to roll out without cracking. Roll the
dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into 4 roughly equal
squares and then roll them out until barely 1/8-inch thick, about 7
to 8 inches across. Place each on an 8- to 9-inch square of parchment
paper, stack, cover and refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   3. Warm the oil in a 12-inch skillet. Add the onions and a few
pinches of salt. Cook over medium-high heat until some of the onions
begin to color, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir, then cook another few minutes
to color another layer of onions. Reduce the heat to medium-low and
stir in the garlic, bay leaf and thyme. Continue cooking until the
onions are lightly golden and tender but not mushy, 10 to 15 minutes.
If they start to dry out, reduce the heat and cover the pan. Taste
and adjust the salt. You should get about 1 1/4 cups. Cool
completely. Remove the thyme and strip the leaves into the onions.
Discard the bay leaf.</TE>
<TE>   4. Allow the prepared dough to warm a few minutes just enough to
fold the edges over without cracking. Place the squares of dough on
their parchment on a baking sheet. Don't worry if the papers overlap.
Prick the surface of each piece of dough lightly with a fork. Spread
each piece with 4 to 5 tablespoons of the cooled onion mixture within
an inch from the edge. Fold in the sides, mitering or lapping the
corners. Press lightly to secure the sides and corners.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake until a rich golden brown, about 20 minutes. The edges of
the onions may begin to caramelize.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rough puff pastry</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Note: This method produces a surprisingly puffy, flaky pastry. Use
this pastry to make the onion tart. To make a sweet puff pastry from
this recipe, just add up to 2 teaspoons of sugar to the flour before
mixing.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour (4 1/2 ounces),</TE>
<TE>   plus more for preparing dough</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) cold salted</TE>
<TE>   butter</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the flour on a cool work surface. Cut the butter
lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices and lay them in the flour, flipping
to coat with flour. Press each butter slice thin, pinching between
your thumbs and fingertips. The slices will break into dimpled,
cupped sheets, about 1/4- to 1/2-inch shards. You won't have
incorporated much of the flour.</TE>
<TE>   2. Spread the pile into a lumpy, circular bed. Trickle ice water
over it, stirring with your fingers as it puddles. If water starts to
flow away, shove loose flour on the leak, then use a scraper to
redirect the water to the dry mass.</TE>
<TE>   3. Scrape in from the edges to roughly consolidate the mass. Slide
the scraper under the mass and fold it over itself. Scrape up loose
bits of dough; tuck them in the crack. Lift the mass, scraping it off
the counter if necessary, then press flat enough to fold again.
Repeat.</TE>
<TE>   4. Continue pressing, scraping, lifting and folding 1 or 2 more
times until all loose bits are incorporated and there are no major
dry spots. You should see large sheets of butter and the surface
should be mottled and dimpled. The dough should be soft; if it's dry,
add up to another tablespoon of water and continue working it. If too
moist, dust the work surface with another tablespoon of flour and
work it in.</TE>
<TE>   5. Wrap the dough loosely and refrigerate 30 minutes. Scrape the
work surface clean.</TE>
<TE>   6. Dust the work surface with 2 tablespoons of flour. (Try to use
no more than this to finish the dough.) Roll out the dough, going
toward and away from yourself, into a roughly rectangular shape about
1/2-inch thick. (Turning the dough over once or twice makes this
easier to do.)</TE>
<TE>   7. Fold the short ends of the dough in over itself in approximate
thirds. Roll out as before and repeat. Rewrap loosely and refrigerate
another 20 minutes. Scrape the work surface clean.</TE>
<TE>   8. Roll and fold the dough in thirds 2 more times. The dough
should be generally smooth but slightly streaky with a few
discernable bits of butter. If the dough seems coarser, roll and fold
it 1 or 2 more times. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before
the final rolling. Or wrap tightly and freeze for later use.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chard with lemon oil</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Zest of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   About 2 pounds green Swiss chard, damaged leaves trimmed</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the oil and zest in a saucepan. Cook over low heat 10
minutes. Don't allow to simmer. Remove from the heat and leave for 30
minutes. Strain out the zest.</TE>
<TE>   2. Strip the leafy green parts of the chard from the stems. Set
the stems aside for another use.</TE>
<TE>   3. Blanch the chard in boiling, lightly salted water. Cook until
the chard is al dente, with no trace of metallic rawness, usually
about 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   4. Lift the leaves from the water and place in ice water. Drain
and layer between towels to dry.</TE>
<TE>   5. Place the chard in a 3-quart saucepan or 12-inch skillet.
Drizzle with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the lemon oil and set over
medium-low heat. Stir and fold until the chard is warm and coated
with lemon oil. Salt to taste. Serve hot, warm or cold.</TE>

<HD>Could Chile be Cabernet's next capital?</HD>
<DH>Still rustic in many respects, the country's ancient wine
industry is establishing itself as a player in the ultra-premium
field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Olken</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chile is known to Americans mostly for inexpensive varietal exports:
simple, almost candied Chardonnays, muddy Cabernets, green-tasting
Sauvignons. But its wine country has vast potential, as many foreign
wine firms, from Robert Mondavi to the Rothschilds, have recognized.
And there is one category in which Chile already competes in terms of
quality on the world stage: ultra-premium Cabernet Sauvignon in the
$50 to $100 range.</LD>
<LD>   Chile's wine country looks the way Sonoma or Napa did years ago,
before either became so developed. You see the same rolling hills,
the same sense of empty expanse. Though wine has been made there for
centuries, it has not yet "arrived," and there still is a rustic
quality to its wines. But its wine industry is developing rapidly,
making Chile a country for wine lovers to watch.</LD>
<LD>   The following Cabernets are good examples of the style, listed in
order of preference.</LD>
<TE>   1997 Carmen Gold, Maipo Valley, $60. This one is my personal
favorite. It has depth, focus, richness and intensity and would show
well in any tasting of similarly priced wines.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Errazuriz, Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve, Aconcagua Valley,
$50. Don Maximiano Errazuriz founded the winery about 130 years ago,
and its most famous wine carries his name. The winery and vineyards
are located north of Santiago in a narrow, ocean-cooled valley and
this wine is made from both hillside and mountain-grown grapes. "Don
Max" in 1999 is a sturdy, rich wine with black cherry fruit in
abundance. It is typical of its warm vintage, but the 1998 Don Max
was less impressive in my blind tastings. A sample of the 2000 showed
the softer, less forceful elegance of other wines of that vintage.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Almaviva, Maipo Valley, $90. This wine, co-produced by
Mouton-Rothschild and Chile's Concha y Toro, has a curranty focus and
sinewy texture. Its finish may be a bit gritty and overripe, but the
depth of character is first-rate.</TE>
<TE>   2000 Almaviva, Maipo Valley, $90. In Chile, 1999 was moderately
warm and 2000 cool. This wine is as well-focused as the 1999 version
but not as deep and rich.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Clos Apalta, Rapel Valley, Apalta Region, $65. The recently
planted Apalta region is a classic foothill location. It's perfect
for highly extracted reds, such as this Merlot, influenced by
consulting enologist Michel Rolland of Bordeaux's Pomerol district.
It tastes of Merlot aged in very good barrels, though it has a gritty
finish contributed by the hillside origin of its grapes.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Montes Alpha "M," Rapel Valley, Apalta Region, $70. There is
a little extra heat in this vineyard, and the wine it produces has an
attractive, rather in-your-face intensity, but the result is more
powerful than refined. I rate it just a little below the preceding
wine; still, this is all Chilean in concept, and winemaker-owner
Aurelio Montes is rightfully gaining fame for his brash winemaking
style.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Sena, Aconcagua Valley, $80. I rate this one equal with the
Montes "M," but the wine itself is very different. The Sena project
combines the energy and winemaking know-how of Robert Mondavi with
the local knowledge of Eduardo Chadwick and his American-born
winemaker, Ed Flaherty. For the first vintages, the grapes come from
the Errazuriz holdings, although the choice of grapes and blend is in
the hands of the Mondavi people. A new, sloped hillside vineyard is
being developed in virgin land that looks like Napa or Sonoma. The
joint venture has been making Sena since 1995, and the 1999 rates
well, although the 1997 seems to be the best vintage of Sena.</TE>
<TE>   1998 Concha y Toro, Don Melchor, Maipo Valley, $40. This
established upper-crust red suffers from the weakness of the 1998
vintage. It has the touch of mint you expect to find in a Cab from
the Maipo Valley, but not the concentration.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Viu Manent No. 1, Colchagua Valley, $70. Lots of power, no
refinement and distracting notes of black pepper and dry tannins.
Chilean wine writers give it high scores, but I humbly disagree.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: LEBANON</KH>
<HD>Kebabs, beer and a water pipe, please</HD>
<DH>This Middle Eastern restaurant is all outdoors. And that's
a good thing for diners enjoying their Turkish tobacco, not to
mention the garlicky fare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So why was I at Mediterranean Garden Grill? Simple: It's the only
Lebanese-style restaurant a Thai American chef has ever tipped me to.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the only Middle Eastern beer garden I've ever been to,
or even heard of. It does indeed serve beer, but though there's a low
hedge of plants around the dining area, what really makes this a beer
garden is the absence of walls -- you're sitting in an old roofed
patio.</LD>
<LD>   That means it's technically outdoors, so there's no restriction on
smoking. Some diners bring water pipes and smoke aromatic Turkish
tobacco while chowing down on, say, frog legs, with Almaza, a malty
Lebanese brew (I'd go so far as to say it's a great frog legs beer).</LD>
<TE>   For some, the absence of walls may be welcome for a different
reason, because this is one of the more garlicky restaurants around.
Everybody knows the Zankou roast chicken chain and its powerful
garlic sauce. You get pretty much the same garlic puree here as soon
as you sit down, along with swatches of pita, and they keep refilling
the garlic bowl as long as you keep asking.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the menu is kebabs, but there are other entrees, in the
saute category, with big chunks of garlic floating around in them.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the informal, semi-outdoor setting, the place has the
feel of a patio party. Or rather, of a couple of parties coexisting
on one largish patio: families joining up a couple of tables so all
the grandparents and grandchildren can sit down, Lebanese homeboys
blowing rings of perfumed smoke, college kids out exploring and local
Monrovian restaurant-goers who have evidently added the place to
their list.</TE>
<TE>   All the usual Middle Eastern starters show up on the appetizer
list.</TE>
<TE>   Hummus comes dressed with olive oil (you can also get it topped
with sauteed beef), the refreshing tabbouleh is mostly parsley with a
little mint and just a bit of bulgur, the grape leaves have a suave
rice and tomato filling, and the baba ghannouj is notable for a
particularly rich, smoky flavor. It's so smoky I wouldn't be
surprised to learn they'd thrown in some hickory smoke flavoring.
(Come to think of it, I wouldn't be offended, either. Baba ghannouj
can never be too smoky for this cowpoke.)</TE>
<TE>   All these items appear on a combo appetizer plate along with feta,
tomatoes and appetizingly sharp pickled cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   The meatless mousakaah</TE>
<TE>   One of the less familiar appetizers is the luscious musaqqa'a
(spelled mousakaah here), which bears scarcely any resemblance to a
Greek moussaka. For one thing, there's no meat in it. It's an Asian
eggplant baked very soft, split in half and topped with a rich,
sweetish sauce of tomato paste and fried onions.</TE>
<TE>   Soujouk is like a cumin-scented salami stewed with tomatoes; the
other sausage, makanek, is short, plump links with a rather shocking
dose of ground cloves, served in a very sharp sauce that's mostly
lemon juice. The restaurant's version of the walnut and red pepper
dip muhammara uses sweet peppers and little, if any, of the usual
pomegranate juice, making it sweet and easy to like. There's a lentil
and Swiss chard soup enlivened with lots of lemon juice and cilantro.</TE>
<TE>   The main entrees are kebabs served on big plates of rice along
with some grilled tomatoes and zucchini. The chicken kebab is tender
and juicy; the beef kebab is surprisingly flavored with soy sauce,
like a Middle Eastern teriyaki (for the record, that part of the
world did have a type of soy sauce centuries ago, but in cooking it
was typically combined with lemon juice for a ponzu sauce effect).</TE>
<TE>   Eggplant kebab is lula (ground beef) with the usual onion and
parsley flavoring, along with a grilled eggplant that unfortunately
tends to be bitter.</TE>
<TE>   The Delicacies and Special Orders section of the menu is where the
garlic comes back.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you order quail, jumbo scampi or frog legs, the dish will
be highly aromatic. The quail are reasonably meaty, and the
restaurant inclines to give them a hot pepper flavoring, as it does
to the somewhat mealy scampi.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we have frog legs</TE>
<TE>   The Lebanese-style frog legs are the specialty, and they're worth
getting. An order serves two; individually, they're scrawny-looking,
but they're meaty enough, and there are eight pairs of them, sauteed
with lots of cilantro and swimming in lemony juices loaded with
sliced garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other dishes in this section, they're subject to
availability, so it would be wise to call and reserve an order.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert is not a big deal. Apart from baklava, the only choice is
ashta, a plate of thickened cream ringed with banana slices and
sprinkled with honey and ground pistachios.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, how do you follow an act like frog legs and beer?</TE>

<HD>Sowing in a second spring</HD>
<DH>In Southern California, the chill of fall can make a
gardener's heart quicken: no retiring for winter -- a new growing
season has only begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like so many Angelenos, I come from somewhere else, a place where
summer is followed by fall. It's taken four years to realize that
I've moved to a place where summer is followed by spring.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least it is when it comes to growing vegetables. The first
clue was that the lettuces at farmers markets somehow contrived to
get lusher, frillier, more tender every autumn. After disappearing
from summer glare, dandelions returned to my lawn in September. Then
there were the intriguing asides on the back of some seed packets:
"Plant again in fall in mild climates."</LD>
<LD>   These were usually the good-for-you foods: kale, spinach, cabbage.
But the thing I crave the most as autumn sets in, and cooking turns
rich, are fresh, light salad greens. Once I realized that these too
were perfect candidates for Southern California's second spring,
there was only one thing left to do: tear up a good chunk of lawn out
back and put in a salad garden.</LD>
<TE>   It would, I grant you, have been easier to buy the arugula by the
bag. The only suitable patch of yard left had the soil condition of
an unloved schoolyard: an evil mix of old rubble, hard, dry clay and
a tangle of Bermuda grass roots. Even rye grass didn't always catch
here.</TE>
<TE>   To sow vegetables from seed, you need the finest, softest,
best-drained soil. In fact, the health of any plant isn't the result
of fertilizer or even seed type. It's soil condition. Nothing is more
important in promoting growth, preventing disease and ensuring that
water reaches but doesn't drown the roots of plants. On farm visits,
I have been shown lettuce beds of plant breeders that are dug 2 feet
deep and lined with gopher wire. By contrast, a shovel driven hard
into my "lawn" went in maybe an inch. A pick swung harder, maybe 2
inches.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking up the clay, picking out the rubble and, with
increasingly ragged fingers, pulling out the Bermuda root took days.
As I transformed myself into a one-woman chain gang, I didn't think
of salad. I thought of every bad moment of bad days and swung the
pick and swore. Mostly I cursed my refusal to use Roundup or other
herbicides.</TE>
<TE>   Then I remembered why I don't and won't. Those products might kill
Bermuda grass, but they don't stop at weeds. They also tend to carry
over and stunt or kill seedlings and can be particularly damaging to
our best-loved garden vegetables. The dandelion is, in fact, a food
plant and close relation to many of our favorite salad leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Assaulting the rubble, I never made it 2 feet deep. At 8 inches, I
felt like Prince Charles, champion of organics. Hail Noble
Horticulturalist! Yo, courtier, pass the beer.</TE>
<TE>   The next step was spading in lots of compost: There was my own,
made from kitchen cuttings and grass clippings. Nowhere near enough.
Composted redwood shavings from a garden supply place came next, and
chicken manure. If you are working with sandy soil, you will need the
compost to add organic matter, and help slow drainage rather than
start it. The chicken manure will add nitrogen to the soil. I covered
the broken-up clay with a mix of roughly 2 inches of compost and one
of manure, and chopped it in, an overall ratio of six of soil to one
of compost and manure. To know how much to buy, measure your plot,
then look for a key on the side of the sack to calculate how much it
will cover. Or, to get it free, go to city recycling centers and
bring a truck or large sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Once I'd dug in all those fragrant improvers, I felt less like
Prince Charles, or Alice Waters, and more like a walking
advertisement for Band-Aids, Neosporin and mentholated muscle rubs.
But when it came to finally raking over the bed, to feeling the fine
soft mix of soil, I couldn't have felt more rejuvenated, more proud,
more hopeful. Soon earthworms that had long ago abandoned the lawn
would move in. Soon this bed would be covered with dewy heads of
lettuce, arugula, radicchio and endive.</TE>
<TE>   I edged the bed with pieces of concrete to discourage encroaching
Bermuda grass, and began marking out my salad zones. First in, the
arugula, which I interspersed with a new, lovely, pale nasturtium,
Vanilla Berry. Both are peppery, the arugula for salad, the
nasturtiums to use whole or diced as slightly hot and vivid
garnishes.</TE>
<TE>   As a break between the arugula and next planting, I put down a pot
with sage, partly for decoration, mainly to discourage the dogs from
trampling the bed. In the next stretch of newly tilled earth,
broccoli raab -- those strong-flavored trim-line florets the chefs
serve with lemon, olive oil, garlic and chile peppers. I love that
dish. Another corner, another pot, and a sack of papalo seeds -- a
gift from a Mexican gardener who tends a plot in a nearby community
garden, and who introduced me to the thrilling herbs papalo and
pepicha. Next section: Swiss chard, a vegetable whose stalks remind
me of asparagus, and leaves of spinach. Three colors: red, yellow and
white. Another pot, followed by a mix of radicchio, endive, mizuna
and Batavian lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   As the seedlings appear, I find myself rushing out each morning to
water them. Hello seedlings! By God, you look delicious already!
Steady, girl. I remind myself that my lip-smacking little seedlings
have weeks to go, snails to survive, before meeting a glorious death
under oil and vinegar. I swear solemnly to them that I will routinely
weed to keep the Bermuda grass at bay. I dimly realize that it will
take more springs, first and second, to figure out what I can grow
and what I will lose to my particular combination of pets and pests.
I calculate the crop cycles like: There will be plenty of time -- the
only stretches where you really can't plant vegetables in this town
are in the inferno weeks of late August and in the midst of a
February downpour. But standing in my garden this particular October
morn, I can't suppress my glee. It feels a little greedy, but I could
do a jig that I live in a place where you can plant salad greens in
autumn.</TE>

<HD>The lure of the truffle catches the wallet by surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Strand</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THERE'S a little ritual taking place in dining rooms all over the
city.</LD>
<LD>   Now that it's truffle season -- and the truffles are particularly
plentiful this year -- waiters are rattling off truffle specials like
there's no tomorrow. Of course, they don't always mention the price.
And so the diner, hungry for that first earthy bite, succumbs to the
suggestion of, say, the white truffle risotto at the Water Grill.</LD>
<LD>   It's lunch. It's an appetizer. How expensive could it be? Then the
bill comes. That little dish cost a whopping $65.</LD>
<TE>   The price stings even more when you learn that last year Italian
white truffles fetched $2,300 a pound, while this year, after a good
rainy season, they're going for less than half at $1,100 a pound,
according to Liaison West, a major truffle importer in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion are the last of the summer truffles. Much
less rare and perfumed, they're only $100 a pound. So if you can't
resist the idea of steamed asparagus with Parmesan and truffles at
Toscana, you're in for a different surprise: It's only $16.</TE>
<TE>   Sushi rolls up</TE>
<TE>   high scores in</TE>
<TE>   latest L.A. Zagat</TE>
<TE>   IS Japanese cuisine the most highly esteemed in the city? The new
Zagat Survey almost shouts "Yes." In the 2003 Los Angeles guide,
released last week, top food honors went to three Japanese
restaurants. Matsuhisa, Sushi Sasabune and Sushi Nozawa each scored
28 on a scale of 1 to 30. Ratings are based on an annual poll of
diners.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Berk, an editor of the L.A. edition, pointed to "the
entertainment value." She said: "It's pure theater. It's not all
about the taste, but the experience as well."</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE</KH>
<HD>What is this, a wine list or a stickup?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sommelier strode so briskly toward our table that the gold
tastevin he wore on a thick chain around his neck was bobbing back
and forth against his ruffled shirt like a buoy in a summer squall.</LD>
<LD>   "Have you found a wine that you would like?" he asked, gesturing
toward the wine list I was holding.</LD>
<LD>   "I've found a lot I like but nothing I can afford," I said. "Given
these confiscatory prices, you should be carrying a gun instead of
that tastevin."</LD>
<TE>   He was startled. But not nearly as startled as I was by the prices
on the wine list. I drink wine almost every night, much of it from
the modest cellar I have at home. That means I buy a good deal of
wine and I know what it costs. I don't begrudge a restaurant a
reasonable profit, but I saw one of my favorite Sancerres on the list
for $65. I had purchased that identical wine -- same maker, same
vintage -- at a store for $16.99 the day before. That means the
restaurant probably got it for about $12, give or take a couple of
bucks.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a reasonable profit. That's highway robbery. Or as Alan
Greenspan would put it, "infectious greed." And that's why so many
people don't order wine in restaurants these days, except on special
occasions. Or they bring their own. Or they order the cheapest wine
on the list, whether it goes with the food they've ordered or not.</TE>
<TE>   Wine prices -- especially California wine prices -- have
skyrocketed over the last decade, and not just in restaurants. The
average annual spending per adult on premium California wines --
wines made from an identified grape varietal, such as Cabernet
Sauvignon, as opposed to a jug wine -- almost quadrupled, from $16 to
$61, between 1990 and 2000, according to Motto Cryla &amp; Fisher, a wine
industry consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that increase is because more people are drinking better
wine. But rapidly escalating prices are a bigger factor.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices are just ludicrous," says Daniel Johnnes, a wine
importer and the wine director at Montrachet in New York. "Gouging is
a real problem. Some restaurants don't seem to realize that in this
economy, people are looking at their purse strings more carefully
than they were a few years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants are not solely responsible -- and in many cases,
they're not even primarily responsible -- for this price escalation.
There's more than enough blame to go around.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Stone, the sommelier at Rubicon in San Francisco and one of
the most respected wine authorities in the country, blames the
wineries -- and the consumers who pay high prices for cult wines.</TE>
<TE>   The boom years</TE>
<TE>   The problem began, Stone says, with the "phylloxera-induced
scarcity of grapes in the late 1980s and early 1990s." That scarcity
led to increased demand -- and prices shot up accordingly. At the
same time, a booming economy inspired many instant millionaires to
decide that owning a winery was the passport to fame, even-greater
fortune and just the sort of return-to-the-land pastoral bliss they'd
always longed for.</TE>
<TE>   They paid big bucks to buy their vineyards, then charged big bucks
for their wines to recoup their investment -- and to satisfy their
ego needs, to keep up with the other Johnny-wine-latelies who were
getting high prices for their wines. Grape growers wanted their share
of the new riches, so they boosted their prices too -- from $3,500 a
ton to $6,000 a ton, almost overnight, Stone says.</TE>
<TE>   That made wine prices jump again -- as have high scores from
Robert Parker and, secondarily, Wine Spectator. Regardless of cost,
some folks just have to have these 96-, 98-, 100-point trophy wines
-- Screaming Eagle, Harlan, Colgin, Bryant Family Vineyard,
Marcassin. The wines are then resold at auctions for several hundred
(or several thousand) dollars a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Such cult wines are made in small quantities -- 300, 500, 800
cases -- and sell quickly, going directly from the wineries to
private mailing list customers and a few select restaurants and
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   That scarcity pushes their prices higher, and larger-production
wineries then feel justified in raising their prices as well.</TE>
<TE>   The basic Napa Valley Cabernet from Caymus Vineyards had a retail
price of $20 to $27 in the early '90s; for the '95 vintage, the price
jumped to $65. The '93 Far Niente Cabernet retailed for $45; list
price on the '99 is $115.</TE>
<TE>   Some wineries now seem embarrassed by their huge price hikes. When
I asked Far Niente about their prices, I was told it was against
company policy to release prices of previous vintages. At Caymus, I
was given only the prices since 1995 -- after the big increase went
into effect -- and was told, "That's as far back as Chuck [owner
Chuck Wagner] would like to go."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't terribly difficult to find the prices -- I got mine from
old copies of Parker's Wine Advocate and from the Wine Spectator and
Duke of Bourbon Web sites -- but since when do companies treat their
retail prices as a trade secret?</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Josh Jensen of Calera Wine Co. is refreshingly open
about his price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen long kept his prices stable and reasonable. His top-end
Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir was $38 in the 1992 vintage, and it was
still $38 for the 1995 vintage. But in 1999, when he released the '96
vintage, he raised all his prices substantially; the Selleck shot up
to $80.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Largely because he thought low prices kept his wines from
getting the respect they deserved. "Critics and consumers
automatically assume that wines selling for under $40 can't possibly
be as good as those selling for two, three, four times that amount,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Wines like Calera's -- only 5% of which are sold directly to
mail-order customers -- go through the normal distribution channels,
as opposed to the direct-mail sales of many small-production wines.
That means most wines are handled by several middlemen -- brokers and
wholesalers -- and each tacks on a fee, which raises prices further.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateurs -- especially high-end restaurateurs -- argue that
they're also entitled to their markup, to cover the cost of
cellaring, good glasses and a trained sommelier. But what's a fair
markup?</TE>
<TE>   Flowing profits</TE>
<TE>   Several restaurateurs I've spoken with recently say 2 1/2 times
their cost is fair for most wines -- somewhat more for cheaper wines,
a little less for high-end wines.</TE>
<TE>   But many restaurants mark up their wines much more, and almost any
strict formula hurts the consumer. If a restaurant paid, say, $20 for
a wine four years ago, then marked it up 2 1/2 times and sold it for
$50, the restaurant's profit was $30. If the restaurant has to pay
$40 for the latest vintage of that wine and also marks it up 2 1/2
times, the consumer has to pay $100 -- and the restaurant's profit
has gone from $30 to $60.</TE>
<TE>   Why not mark it up less and settle for, say, a $45 profit (still
50% more than four years ago)?</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant wine prices, like the policies behind them, vary
enormously from restaurant to restaurant, though, even at the same
type of restaurant, in the same general location.</TE>
<TE>   You want a really nice bottle of Cabernet to drink with your
sirloin at one of the downtown Los Angeles steakhouses?</TE>
<TE>   You could pay $100 for either the '99 Lewis Cellars Reserve or the
'98 Stag's Leap Fay Vineyard Cab at the Pacific Dining Car -- or you
could pay $160 and $190, respectively, for the exact same wines at
Nick &amp; Stef's. You could pay $80 for the '98 Silver Oak Alexander
Valley Cabernet at the Pacific Dining Car or you could pay $108 at
Arnie Morton's -- or $120 at the Palm.</TE>
<TE>   For many restaurants, wine is a major profit center. They've long
charged a high markup on hard liquor, and they use that as a model
for their wine pricing. During the economic boom of the '90s, they
could get away with that. Many high rollers (and their bosses)
figured the more they paid for a bottle of wine, the more they
impressed their clients and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye, big spender</TE>
<TE>   No more. In today's economy, restaurants -- especially high-end
restaurants -- are hurting, and sales of big-ticket wines are down
dramatically. Restaurants can help their customers and themselves by
pricing wine more reasonably. A customer who doesn't feel cheated is
more likely to buy a bottle, rather than a glass or two -- or a
second bottle rather than a single bottle. He's also more likely to
listen to a sommelier's recommendation, to drink a wine that goes
well with his food, to enjoy the entire experience -- and to return
and order a better bottle.</TE>
<TE>   It's time that restaurants realized that. And it's time that
California wineries became equally realistic. Bordeaux, which also
dramatically raised its prices through the '80s and '90s, cut its
future prices for the 2001 vintage as much as 37% from 2000,
recognizing the downturn in the economy and the qualitative drop from
the 2000 vintage.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are accustomed to that fluctuation in French wine
prices, says Calera's Jensen, but in part because there has
traditionally been less dramatic variation in quality from vintage to
vintage in California, "it's always been a truism, an unspoken rule,
in the high end of the American wine market that you can't lower
prices from one vintage to the next. If you do, people will think
you're saying it was a crappy vintage and they won't buy your wines."</TE>
<TE>   Some California wineries have cut or held the line on prices.
(Calera dropped the price on its '99 Selleck Pinot from $80 to $55.)
But too many California wineries have continued to raise prices, even
for the widely derided 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon vintage. Given the
current grape glut in California -- and increased competition,
especially in low-to-medium-priced wines, from southern France,
southern Italy, Spain, Australia and South America -- the failure to
take a more reasonable approach to pricing could cost California
wineries, and the restaurants and retailers they supply, much of the
ground they've gained with consumers in the last 20 years.</TE>

<LD>A dacquoise is not a simple recipe and, as we discovered in making it
ourselves, there are some essential elements in the process that
don't always show up in the directions.</LD>
<LD>   First, it's best to tackle it in stages. Make the meringue layers
a day ahead. After they finish baking, turn off the heat and let them
sit in the oven overnight so they can dry out (otherwise the
meringues become moist and chewy as they stand). The ganache can also
be made a day ahead. Cover it tightly and put it in the refrigerator
overnight.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, about an hour before you assemble the dacquoise,
prepare the buttercream and refrigerate it long enough to allow it to
set up so it will spread nicely. You'll want to take the ganache out
of the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for 15
minutes (or until it's soft enough to spread). Next, be sure to whip
the cream until stiff peaks form (stirring in the rum at the end
tends to thin it out).</LD>
<TE>   Before you assemble the dacquoise you'll want to trim the edges of
the meringues so they're all the same size. We failed to do this the
first time we tested the recipe and ended up with a lopsided dessert.
Use the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan as a guide, and use a
sharp knife to cut along the outside. The smooth, even edges also
make for easy frosting.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, begin assembling the dessert by putting a dollop of
ganache in the middle of the platter to "glue" the meringue to the
plate. The meringues are delicate, so spread the buttercream and
ganache with a light touch.</TE>
<TE>   When finished, chill the dacquoise in the refrigerator for an hour
or two. This will make cutting and serving easier. A serrated knife
works best for cutting through the meringue layers; wipe the knife
and dip it in cold water between slices.</TE>
<TE>   This dessert should be eaten two to four hours after you assemble
it. Let it stand longer, and it loses its crispness.</TE>
<TE>   And after all that effort, you don't want anything less than
perfection.</TE>

<DH>Roasting peppers brings out their true nature: earthy and
sensual.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BACK in the old days, we're talking 10 or 15 years ago, this time of
year was something special. As soon as the weather started to turn,
we'd go down to the specialty produce guy and put in an order for a
case of red bell peppers. You got them only once a year and they cost
the earth, but they were worth it.</LD>
<LD>   That weekend we'd have a big party. We'd char the peppers on the
grill, then, sitting out back at the picnic table, peel them, seed
them and stick the soft, warm flesh into plastic bags to go into the
freezer.</LD>
<LD>   Well, actually they only went into the baggies after everyone had
eaten their fill. There's little that tastes better than roasted red
bell peppers and even though they are available year-round now, this
is the best time of year to enjoy them.</LD>
<TE>   Roasted peppers are one of food's sure things. They're beautiful
to look at, a deep Titian red. They have a voluptuous texture, closer
to a nice, fatty piece of tuna sashimi than a vegetable. And their
flavor is a profound mix of sweet and earthy, pungent and perfectly
balanced by itself.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest dish in the world, and one of the most satisfying, is
a plate of roasted, peeled peppers dressed only with a little good
olive oil and a sprinkling of salt. The pepper repertoire doesn't
stop there, of course, but anything else you do is a matter of
adornment rather than improvement.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most common pairings for peppers is with tomatoes, one
of nature's other perfect foods. All over the Mediterranean basin,
these two show up in dishes both simple (roasted pepper and tomato
salad) and complex (peperonata, found under different names from
Spain to Morocco).</TE>
<TE>   Roasted peppers are utterly unlike raw ones. In the first place,
roasting removes that thin skin of cellulose. That's the tough part
that's so difficult to digest. And it gently cooks the meat,
softening it and bringing out hidden dimensions of flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The sources of heat</TE>
<TE>   There are any number of ways to roast a pepper. Perhaps the most
primal is simply throwing them on the grill. This has the advantage
of accommodating a large number of peppers at the same time. A
regular 21-inch kettle grill will easily hold more than a dozen large
peppers at once. Just keep turning them to hit every bit of skin
(including the bottoms and the tops), and move them from place to
place so every pepper gets its turn over the hottest parts of the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead and char them. You're not looking for browning here, but
a definite blackening of the surface. So tough is this skin that even
after this rough treatment, when you peel it off, there will be red
flesh underneath. Roasting peppers over fire also lends a distinct
but subtle smokiness to the flavor.</TE>
<TE>   You can roast large batches even more easily in the oven, if
you're willing to forgo that smoky grace note (indeed, in recipes
such as the peppers stuffed with tuna, a purer flavor is better). To
do this, arrange the peppers on a jellyroll pan and bake them at 400
degrees, turning them once or twice to keep them from sticking.
Cooked this way, the skin will puff up like a balloon without nearly
as much blackening.</TE>
<TE>   Roasting peppers on the grill will take from 25 to 35 minutes,
depending on the heat (it's a good thing to do while you're waiting
for a really hot fire to die down enough to cook meat). Roasting them
in the oven takes 20 to 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever method you choose, once the skin has begun to loosen,
cover the peppers with a damp cloth and let them cool for 10 to 15
minutes. The steam will finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   Some cooks recommend roasting them under the broiler or over an
open flame on a stove-top burner. Although these methods will work,
they have significant drawbacks. The broiler cooks the peppers too
unevenly. Doing them stove-top has the obvious disadvantage of
letting you do only one or two at a time. And heaven help you if a
roasting pepper pops, as they are wont to do, spilling its juices so
it bakes onto the stove.</TE>
<TE>   Peel the peppers by rubbing away that charred skin with your
fingers. For tough spots that might have been a little underdone or
were in hard-to-reach crevices, use the back of a knife. Though you
may be tempted to rinse them to get rid of the last little flecks of
skin, don't. The flesh is coated with a thick, delicious juice and
you don't want to lose any of it.</TE>
<TE>   How to pick a pepper</TE>
<TE>   You'll find red bell peppers ranging in size and shape from small
and boxy to long and tapered. Some of the biggest ones are
proprietary varieties grown in California, Florida and Mexico. Don't
let that dissuade you. In taste tests, we were amazed at the quality
and depth of flavor of the peppers we found at our decidedly
un-gourmet neighborhood supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, you'll find peppers in colors other than red.
Almost any grocery store will have yellow ones, too, and many will
have purple, orange and even chocolate brown.</TE>
<TE>   These peppers taste essentially the same -- the colors come from a
nearly flavorless family of pigments called carotenoids. These are
the same chemicals that make tomatoes red and peaches yellow
(peppers, like tomatoes, are botanically fruits, even though we eat
them as vegetables).</TE>
<TE>   And just like peaches and tomatoes, the emergence of the bright
colors is tied to the ripening process. While all peppers start out
looking green, their more flamboyant plumage is actually there all
the time, masked by the dominant pigment chlorophyll.</TE>
<TE>   As the peppers ripen and the sugar levels increase, the
chlorophyll breaks down. The green cloak drops and the mature colors
are revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Because roasting peppers is one of those things where it's just as
easy to do a dozen as it is to do one, you might want to store some
to use another day.</TE>
<TE>   They do freeze remarkably well because of their high moisture
content (one more reason to save all those juices you'll find on the
inside). You don't even need to peel them -- stick them straight into
the bag once they've cooled enough that they won't melt it. Later,
when you're ready to use them, you can defrost and peel as many as
you need. Pickled peppers you find in jars in the grocery story have
a much different flavor because of the vinegar they're preserved in.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, since they're available so constantly in these modern
times, freezing them doesn't carry the same sense of urgency as it
once did. But as any pioneer will tell you, having roasted red
peppers in the freezer is the culinary equivalent of money in the
bank.</TE>

<TE>   Salad of roasted peppers and ricotta salata</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: Ricotta salata is a moist, firm, tangy cheese. If you can't
find it, use dabs of fresh goat cheese instead.</TE>
<TE>   4 red bell peppers, or a combination of red and yellow peppers,
roasted, peeled and seeded</TE>
<TE>   6 green olives, pitted and</TE>
<TE>   cut into slivers</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons Sherry or</TE>
<TE>   red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 anchovy filets, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces ricotta salata</TE>
<TE>   1. Tear or cut the peppers into generous bite-sized pieces. Toss
together the peppers and the olives in a mixing bowl.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the vinegar, garlic, salt and anchovies in a small bowl
and whisk to combine. Drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to
whisk the mixture.</TE>
<TE>   3. Pour the dressing over the peppers and toss to coat well. Turn
the salad out onto a serving platter. Using a vegetable peeler, shave
off long shards of the ricotta salata over top. Don't be stingy with
the cheese. Serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Roasted red pepper crostini</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: Pimenton de la vera is a smoky Spanish paprika that adds a
distinctive note to this recipe. If you can't find it, hot Hungarian
paprika will work, or you can just leave it out.</TE>
<TE>   1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled and seeded</TE>
<TE>   1/2 clove garlic</TE>
<TE>   4 1/2 ounces fresh goat cheese</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon pimenton de la vera</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   12 slices rough country bread, preferably pane osso or batard</TE>
<TE>   1. Remove a rough quarter of the pepper, cut it into thin slivers
and set it aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. With the motor running, drop the garlic through the feed tube
of a food processor and mince well. Add the 3/4 portion of the pepper
and grind as smooth as you can. Add the goat cheese and grind again.
There will still be little bits of red pepper visible in the goat
cheese. Stop, scrape down the sides, and then continue processing
until the mixture is smooth and light, about 45 seconds. Add the
vinegar, pimenton, salt and olive oil and process some more. You
should have about 3/4 cup. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to
use. If it's going to be longer than 30 minutes, refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   3. Toast the bread until golden just before serving. Spread a
generous tablespoon of the topping on each slice of bread and garnish
with some of the thinly sliced pepper (don't be too geometric with
the garnish, a lazy strewing looks best).</TE>

<TE>   Peperonata</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: Peperonata, a basic stew of tomatoes, onions and peppers, is
found all over the Mediterranean. There are as many recipes for it as
there are cooks. Here, the final fillip of the chile, garlic and herb
sauce is inspired by a recipe in Patience Gray's "Honey From a Weed."</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, sliced</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chopped tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   5 bell peppers, preferably a mixture of red and yellow, roasted,
peeled and seeded, cut into bite-size pieces</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 jalapeno, roasted, peeled and seeded</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chopped basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1. Warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium
heat. Add the onion and cook until it softens, about 5 minutes. Add
the tomatoes and bell peppers and cook briefly. Add the red wine and
1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, about 10
minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking, stirring occasionally,
another 10 to 15 minutes. Check frequently toward the end, as the
peppers will want to stick to the bottom of the pan.</TE>
<TE>   2. Meanwhile, pound the jalapeno and garlic into a paste in a
mortar with another 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the basil and parsley;
pound to a paste. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil and stir, grinding
more with the pestle. The sauce should have a rather loose
consistency, somewhat more liquid than pesto.</TE>
<TE>   3. Stir the sauce into the peppers, taste for salt and heat
through, 2 minutes. This is good hot, cold or anywhere in between.</TE>

<HD>Where the food turns heads, too</HD>
<DH>At Whist, white vinyl cozies up to foie gras, and a hot bar
scene rubs elbows with an extraordinary menu. Who says style and
substance don't mix?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the longest time Tim Goodell's restaurant, Aubergine in Newport
Beach, was the lure that people in Orange County could hold out to
Angelenos whenever they wanted to persuade them to brave the traffic
and drive south.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Goodell and his wife, Liza, have opened Whist in Santa Monica
and it too -- at its best -- offers some remarkable dining. His food
here is smart and unfussy, sensual and satisfying.</LD>
<LD>   It's set in the new and hyper-trendy Viceroy Hotel a block from
the beach. For a chef who confidently has gone his own way with
highly personal idiosyncratic restaurants, the move to a hotel
restaurant is something of a surprise. Goodell, however, did cook at
the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco before moving home to Newport Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The Viceroy is part of a new breed of boutique hotels where design
is paramount and an affluent young crowd is assiduously courted. The
question is will the hipsters who throng Viceroy's inviting bar and
dramatic outdoor patio commit to an evening of full-scale dining? And
will the serious diners at Whist enjoy the experience despite the
ditsy-chic decor and the din that leaks in from the bar?</TE>
<TE>   So far, I have to say, so good. The bar, at least on the weekends,
is bubbling over, every white vinyl wing chair, every patent leather
sofa taken. Even the "library" with its skewed bookshelves and gold
shag carpet hasn't got a free seat. The dining room is full too, the
tables closely packed. The mood is high-spirited fun, if you don't
mind having to shout across the table to be heard. It's definitely an
unconventional setting for what most people think of as fine dining.
(For those who want to keep it simple, Whist offers a crib list of
steaks, chops and a fine hand-chopped burger.)</TE>
<TE>   The dining room decor, by L.A. designer-of-the-moment Kelly
Wearstler, plays off a rock 'n' roll notion of style that's not going
to age well. The cheesy silver wallpaper, ugly geodesic light
fixtures and an entire wall plastered with plates give the room the
feeling of a Las Vegas breakfast room, while the color scheme --
black and white, silver and an eye-popping Kelly green -- seems
straight out of the pre-Tom Ford Gucci era.</TE>
<TE>   Cabana party</TE>
<TE>   To bridge the gap between the two worlds -- bar scene and serious
dining -- Whist reels them both in with glamorous private cabanas
where 10 guests can order in the chef's tasting menu. Despite a
minimum of $95 per person, there seem to be plenty of takers. On a
Friday night, branched candelabra are blazing in several of the
stylish black-and-white tents and plates are practically licked
clean.</TE>
<TE>   At Whist, Goodell takes the role of executive chef. Jeff
Armstrong, who has worked with Goodell for a number of years and also
is chef at Red Pearl Kitchen, the Goodells' chic Asian boite in
Huntington Beach, is chef de cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   The pared-down one-page menu strikes a casual note. As a starter,
the glorious mi-cuit foie gras is hard to resist. It comes in a
wide-mouthed French canning jar ready to slather on rafts of toast.
It's a terrific way to begin a meal, but it was nowhere to be seen on
the latest menu. Never mind. You can still get your foie gras fix,
namely a thick slab of foie gras au torchon, the flavor of the
poached duck liver heightened by crystals of fleur de sel that
explode on the palate like starbursts. It's complemented by an
intense pear chutney.</TE>
<TE>   Here, instead of soup of the day, there's a daily foie gras. One
night it was a gorgeous cone of fattened duck liver the size of a
fist, seared on one side and so astonishingly velvety, the person who
ordered it was the envy of the table. Set off by a sweet-tart roasted
pineapple and stinging black pepper gastrique, this may be the best
dish here.</TE>
<TE>   Juicy slices of heirloom tomatoes in autumnal shades of red, gold
and mahogany are stacked like hot cakes flanked by dabs of piquant
fresh goat cheese. Steak tartare, though, is so overdosed with grain
mustard that the taste of the hand-chopped beef is lost.</TE>
<TE>   The menu's strength is the way it rides the edge, shuffling the
familiar with dishes people who really love food will zero in on. So
along with a dressed-up salad of poached Bosc pears, candied walnuts
and Maytag blue cheese, for example, Goodell has sneaked in seared
pork belly filigreed with chile-laced caramel and a brilliant hamachi
carpaccio lightly perfumed with a sesame-chile vinaigrette.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses come on strong with a terrific version of the classic
skate wing in brown butter. You don't want to give up a bite.
Sparkling fresh, the spotted skate wing is cooked on the bone to
tease out every glimmer of flavor, and served in a brown butter lit
up with tiny capers and baby artichokes en barigoule. Duck breast is
embellished with a honey-coriander glaze that perfectly suits its
gamy flavor. However, spinach tagliatelle with lamb ragu and
Parmigiano shaved over the top is, like most French takes on pasta,
overly rich and missing the point. Roasted pork rack, really a double
chop, is juicy and tender but outshone by the collard greens stewed
with apple-smoked bacon that come with it. Among the sides, the
must-have is potatoes au gratin for two.</TE>
<TE>   A 'hotel' experience</TE>
<TE>   When it opened in late July, Whist's food was delicious and
rigorously executed, but I wondered what would happen when Goodell
left the kitchen on its own. On a weekend evening when every table is
full, almost every dish tastes newly minted, humming with flavor.
Oddly, though, on a slower weekday night I've had such an
inexplicably dull meal that, I hate to say, seemed like hotel food as
usual. But that was only once in four or five visits.</TE>
<TE>   When everything's working, Whist is very, very good, but as with
any young restaurant, the kitchen occasionally stumbles. Service is
marred by too many managers in suits breathing down the necks of the
servers. It doesn't make for the most comfortable experience.</TE>
<TE>   The wine list, while more eclectic than that of most high-end
hotels, bears the stigma of high markups. Weighted toward California
and France, it includes a smattering of cutting-edge wines such as
the Gross Musketeller from Austria or Rivetti's single vineyard
Barbaresco, Vigneto Starderi, from La Spinetta. Whist's $15 corkage
is more than fair given staff that knows how to pour and the quality
of the glassware.</TE>
<TE>   The dessert menu includes a delightful category: desserts for the
table. When the waiter sets down a glass bowl of dreamy trifle heaped
with perfect berries and a cloud of whipped cream, everyone has a
spoon poised. It's an unconventional version, fresher and lighter
than the traditional spongecake macerated in liqueur and layered with
berries, jam and cream. Another night my table shared a tart covered
in sunny apricots that tasted as if it had just come out of the oven.</TE>
<TE>   An individual Winesap apple tarte tatin turns out to be a tatin in
name only -- without the irresistible burnt sugar and butter soaked
deep into the apples. Less successful too is chocolate mille-feuille,
a scoop of cloying chocolate cream held in place by shards of tough
chocolate-stained pastry. Best bet is to head straight to the
custards and either the chocolate pot de creme, which is sort of
chocolate pudding squared, or the tapioca brulee. Served chilled,
it's basically tapioca beads cooked in cream and topped with lovely
little caramelized bananas. Where has tapioca been all these years?</TE>
<TE>   It's encouraging to see Goodell stepping onto a larger stage.
Somehow I don't see him as Southern California's best-kept secret for
much longer. His passionate intelligence and dead-on instinct for
what people really want to eat already has found an enthusiastic
audience at Whist, though the restaurant still has some growing up to
do.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: My mother used to make a dessert consisting of five or six
layers of meringue (baked and dried for two days) and mocha or
chocolate buttercream frosting.</LD>
<LD>   The meringue absorbed the buttercream for a day and the result was
a delicious, decadent, chewy and crunchy cake.</LD>
<LD>   Would you have the recipe?</LD>
<TE>   Barbery Byfield</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Dear Barbery: We think you may be looking for a dacquoise recipe.
This one is "delicious, decadent, chewy and crunchy," but it has
three layers of meringue. It's from "The Silver Palate Good Times
Cookbook" by Julee Rosso, Sheila Lukins and Sarah L. Chase (Workman
Publishing, 1985).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dacquoise</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours, plus 3 hours chilling and 8 hours standing</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meringues</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup ground almonds</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</TE>
<TE>   1 cup powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup superfine sugar</TE>
<TE>   6 egg whites, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Line each of 3 baking sheets with
parchment paper. Trace an 8-inch circle on the center of each. Set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Using repeated pulses, process the almonds and cocoa in a food
processor to mix thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   3. Mix the powdered sugar and superfine sugar in a bowl; set
aside. Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl at medium speed until
foamy, 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and then the sugars, 1
tablespoon at a time, until the meringue is shiny and thick, 6 to 7
minutes. Gently fold in the almond mixture.</TE>
<TE>   4. Carefully spoon the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a
plain 1/2-inch tip. Pipe the meringue in a spiral to completely fill
each of the 3 circles. If any meringue is left, change the pastry bag
to a star tip and pipe small stars onto the baking sheets between the
circles. They'll be used later for decorating the dacquoise; set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake the meringues until they are dry but not browned, 1 hour.
Turn off the oven and let the meringues stand in the oven overnight.
The meringues can be prepared 2 to 3 days ahead; wrap and store in a
dry place.</TE>
<TE>   Ganache</TE>
<TE>   4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream, scalded</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons rum</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream, cold</TE>
<TE>   1. Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over
simmering water. Remove the pan from the water; stir in the cream.
Whisk until smooth, then blend in the rum. Refrigerate, covered,
until firm but not hardened, 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   2. Remove the ganache to a large mixer bowl and beat until the
consistency of frosting, 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Beat the cold cream until it forms soft peaks, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir about 1/4 of the whipped cream into the ganache to lighten, then
fold in the remaining cream. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, covered,
until ready to use.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buttercream</TE>
<TE>   1 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup water</TE>
<TE>   6 egg yolks, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons instant coffee powder</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons hot brewed coffee</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and heat to
boiling. Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 250
degrees on a candy thermometer.</TE>
<TE>   2. Meanwhile, beat the yolks until thick. Pour in the sugar syrup
in a thin stream, beating constantly until the mixture cools, about
10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Beat in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Dissolve the
instant coffee in the brewed coffee; beat into the buttercream.
Refrigerate, covered, until firm but spreadable, about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whipped cream</TE>
<TE>   1 cup whipping cream, cold</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon instant coffee powder</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons rum</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Beat the cream until it starts to hold peaks. Beat in the
sugar, instant coffee and rum. Continue beating until stiff, 4 to 5
minutes. Refrigerate 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   1. Place one meringue layer on a platter and spread with a thin
layer of buttercream. Cover with ganache, smoothing in an even layer.
Top with a second meringue layer and spread with whipped cream. Top
with the last meringue layer.</TE>
<TE>   2. Spread the side and top of the dacquoise with the remaining
buttercream. Using a pastry bag, pipe any remaining buttercream in a
pattern over the top.</TE>
<TE>   3. Sprinkle the top with the almonds and decorate the side with
meringue stars. Refrigerate 1 hour.</TE>

<HD>Chefs are thinking inside the bento box</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People love the Japanese bento because the box's compartments offer
so many interesting tidbits -- meat, seafood, vegetables, rice and
pickles, selected according to the season and presented with great
artistry. Leave it to chefs in Los Angeles to bend the bento to their
own inspiration, creating appealing packages of Asian-inspired fusion
food. Here are three of the best. All can be packed to go.</LD>
<LD>   Variety and value</LD>
<LD>   The highlight of Andre Guerrero's box at Max in Sherman Oaks is
his signature Filipino lumpia. It comes with a terrific array of
Asian fusion dishes such as black cod in a coconut-lemongrass sauce,
barbecued shrimp in mandarin sauce and filet mignon with Chinese
steak sauce.</LD>
<TE>   The box is an outstanding value for $15.50, at Max, 13355 Ventura
Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 784-2915.</TE>
<TE>   Fine takeout dining</TE>
<TE>   Luxury ingredients and intricate preparation characterize the
bento at Mako restaurant in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   One day's box included thinly sliced New Zealand kanpachi sashimi
and yellowtail sushi,  soft-shell crab and a juicy morsel of lamb
shank in five-spice Port wine sauce on top of finely cut grilled
vegetables. The sushi rice roamed far from tradition with ingredients
such as sun-dried tomatoes, ginger and shiitake braised in sweetened
soy sauce. There also were multicolored pickles made from beets.</TE>
<TE>   Chef Makato Tanaka changes the box daily. The price is $29.50 at
Mako restaurant, 225 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (310) 288-8338.</TE>
<TE>   Pick any main</TE>
<TE>   You choose the main dish at Michelia, a Euro-Asian bistro in
Beverly Hills. We selected chef Kimmy Tang's Vietnamese curry
containing shrimp and bright orange yam in a coconut-milk sauce. The
side dishes included a deep-fried imitation crab claw and rice topped
with black sesame seeds.</TE>
<TE>   The box, a lunch special, is $8.95 at Michelia, 8738 W. 3rd St.,
Beverly Hills. (310) 276-8288.</TE>

<HD>Panini makers, from zero to $600</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Lowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The panini press is on its way to becoming this decade's version of
the gelato maker or espresso machine: a sophisticated appliance that
promises to turn out a simple Italian pleasure right in your very own
kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   Panini, of course, are the thin sandwiches Americans are becoming
addicted to. The components are simple: bread and cheese, vegetables
or meat. The sandwich is put into a contraption like a waffle iron,
toasted and pressed until it becomes an irresistible sum of its
parts.</LD>
<LD>   Who wouldn't want to reproduce that at home? And so store shelves
now display these latest gadgets for the counter top, ranging in
price from about $80 for a basic model to $600 for a professional
version.</LD>
<TE>   We put a couple to the test and threw in a little of our own
ingenuity: How good a panini could we make with nothing more than a
cast-iron skillet and a "press" made from a baking sheet and a couple
of bricks?</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the scale, the $600 Equipex almost frightened us.
Heavy and capable of high heat (up to 570 degrees), it pressed the
sandwich the best, producing deep grill marks; it was nice, flat and
looked made in Italy -- or at least a restaurant. The top adjusted to
fit what was on the grill, and held the sandwich firmly in place.</TE>
<TE>   The modestly priced grill by Flama produced a disappointing
sandwich; the adjustable lid wasn't heavy enough. Our panini stood
taller than it should have and looked like an ordinary grilled cheese
sandwich. The grill marks on the bread were golden but uneven
(probably because of that lack of pressure).</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there was our do-it-yourself model. We heated a cast-iron
grill pan, slapped on some sandwiches, and smooshed them with two
bricks on top of a baking sheet. The result: Grill marks scored the
bread in a deep, rustic way and the cheese melted in gooey dribbles
down the crust. The sandwich was hot and messy -- a perfect panini.</TE>
<TE>   Are we ready to run out and buy one of these machines? No, but if
you can point us in the direction of a brickyard, we're set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ferrari of</TE>
<TE>   sandwich presses</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: The Equipex panini press is almost too
heavy for one person to lift. Big and industrial-looking, it has the
heft and high heat to flatten and evenly grill a sandwich in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: The adjustable lid made panini making a snap, but
we'd buy this baby only if we ran a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   How much: $600 at Surfas in Culver City, and at other restaurant
supply stores.</TE>
<TE>   The middle of the road: no fuss and no frills</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: The Flama looks like a waffle iron -- it's
lightweight but the adjustable lid isn't heavy enough to flatten a
sandwich. The result: more a grilled cheese than a panini.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: Kind of wimpy. Sure, you can say you make panini
at home, but is this what you really want?</TE>
<TE>   How much: $89.95 from Sur La Table stores and at www.surla
table.com, as well as other kitchen stores and Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   For do-it-yourselfers: Take two bricks....</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference: No trip to the store is necessary. Just
heat a grill pan over medium-high heat, slap on the sandwiches, top
with a baking sheet weighted with two bricks, and grill 2 1/2
minutes. Flip, weight again, and grill 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: Outstanding. Sometimes, technology isn't better.</TE>
<TE>   How much: Free, or the cost of two bricks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grilled eggplant, arugula and mozzarella panini</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   4 slices eggplant, each 1/2-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   Extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   8 slices country-style bread, each 1/2-inch thick</TE>
<TE>   2 cups loosely packed arugula leaves</TE>
<TE>   8 ounces thinly sliced fresh mozzarella</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat a grill pan over high heat, or heat an electric panini
grill on the highest setting according to the manufacturer's
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   2. Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with olive oil and
season with salt and pepper. Arrange the eggplant on the grill pan,
set a small baking sheet on top and weight evenly with 2 bricks. (Or,
arrange the eggplant on the panini grill and close the lid, making
sure it makes even contact with the eggplant.) Cook until dark grill
marks appear, 2 1/2 minutes, then turn and cook the second side 30
seconds. (On the panini maker, cook 3 to 4 minutes.) Transfer the
eggplant to a warmed plate.</TE>
<TE>   3. Brush one side of each slice of bread with olive oil. With the
oiled sides of the bread down, arrange the eggplant, arugula and
mozzarella on 4 of the slices, seasoning each layer lightly with salt
and pepper. Top each with one of the other slices of bread, oiled
side up. Season the outside of the sandwiches with salt and pepper.
Reduce the heat to medium-high and place 2 of the sandwiches on the
grill pan, cover with the baking sheet and again weight with the
bricks. Cook until dark grill marks appear, 2 1/2 minutes, then
remove the bricks and baking sheet and turn the sandwiches carefully.
Weight them down again and cook 30 seconds. (For the panini maker,
reduce the heat to 400 degrees, close the lid and be sure it makes
even contact with the sandwiches. Cook until dark grill marks appear,
3 to 4 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   4. Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board and cut in half.
Serve immediately and repeat with the remaining 2 sandwiches.</TE>

operation than ever.</DH>

<LD>GOOD news for fans of Lazy Creek Vineyards: The 1999 sale of the tiny
Mendocino County estate to a young Napa Valley couple was not the
calamity many feared. In fact, it was the beginning of a new chapter
in the tiny estate's 30-year history.</LD>
<LD>   That's demonstrated by the current Lazy Creek releases from the
2000 vintage, the first entirely controlled by new owners Josh and
Mary Beth Chandler. The Pinot Noirs (Estate and Reserve), Chardonnay
and Gewurztraminer are some of the most intense and vibrant
expressions of the Lazy Creek terroir to date.</LD>
<LD>   Lazy Creek was a cult winery before the term was coined. Since its
founding by Swiss immigrants Hans and Therese Kobler in 1972, its
output has never exceeded 4,000 cases. And its followers are
passionate. Most of the estate's production is sold through a mailing
list, and virtually all of its regular customers have made the trek
at least once to the remote Anderson Valley location.</LD>
<TE>   It's a delightful pilgrimage. The unmarked dirt road in the
northwest corner of Anderson Valley winds through the gloom of an
ancient redwood forest. It crosses three tiny bridges over the
meandering creek before bursting into a sunny glade to reveal a scene
straight out of a fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   There's a quaint little house and winery behind a flower-decked
rail fence. Tidy close-pruned vines grace the surrounding slopes
where each vine block has its own name. Two were named after Kobler
pets who are buried there -- a cat on Mitzi's Hill, a beagle on the
Schnoopie block. Birds twitter, sheep baa, butterflies flash in the
sun. Hans Christian Andersen would feel right at home.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson Valley has one of California's coolest grape-growing
climates. The valley drinks in cold air and fog from the nearby
Pacific during the growing season. That marine influence makes it
ideal for Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and the delicate pink-hued Alsatian
grape called Gewurztraminer.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s it was nearly impossible to find decent clones
of those varieties in California. So the Koblers did it the
old-fashioned way -- they took cuttings from famous French vineyards
and brought them home in their suitcases. Legal concerns keep the
Koblers from confirming the sources, but it is widely believed that
the Lazy Creek Pinot Noir vines were propagated from Domaine de la
Romanee Conti, the world's most famous Pinot vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   When the Koblers decided to retire in the late 1990s there was
keen interest in the property among large wine producers. Rumored
suitors (the Koblers decline to specify) included Duckhorn, Kenwood,
Roederer, Fife, Kendall-Jackson and Silverado Vineyards owner Diane
Disney Miller.</TE>
<TE>   But the Koblers sensed that companies like that would merely
absorb Lazy Creek into their larger brands. They wanted to pass it on
to someone who would treasure it and carry on the spirit of the place
-- preferably a young couple who wanted to raise a family there.</TE>
<TE>   A couple like the Chandlers. Josh Chandler, 37, is an
award-winning landscape architect and home builder whose work has
been featured in Better Homes &amp; Gardens, Metropolitan Home and other
magazines. He has designed gardens for wineries such as Far Niente
and Cakebread. He's also a chef, having trained with Masa Kobayashi
at Auberge du Soleil in the 1980s. Mary Beth Chandler, 31, worked in
wine marketing, most recently for the Chalone Group.</TE>
<TE>   They were married in 1999 and immediately began scouting for
property. "We wanted to own land and grow grapes, and we wanted to
work together," Josh says. "I've always enjoyed Pinot, and we were
looking for a place we could afford. That led us out to Anderson
Valley. We didn't know about Lazy Creek, but we'd heard that the
folks wanted to sell it to someone who was going to carry it on."</TE>
<TE>   The Koblers paid $1,000 an acre for the 87-acre property in 1972.
They sold it to the Chandlers for $2 million, a fraction of what a
similar property would cost in Napa Valley, where bargains start
around $100,000 an acre.</TE>
<TE>   The Chandlers showed their commitment to the property's integrity
immediately by instituting organic farming methods and lowering the
yield -- already small on those old vines -- to an average of two
tons per acre, "about one cluster per shoot," says Josh. They've cut
Lazy Creek's production from 3,500 cases a year to 2,000. And they
raised the prices for the new lower-yield wines to match other
new-generation small estates. The Estate Pinot Noir, for example, has
gone from $15 to $32; the Reserve is $62.50.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Koblers, now in their 70s, have retired to a
self-designed dream house in the redwood forest just a stone's throw
from Lazy Creek. Old customers still come by to see them, often
bearing older bottles of Lazy Creek wine to share with the founders.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss the grape growing and winemaking a little," says Hans.
"But I don't miss all the people."</TE>
<TE>   To which Therese adds, "I miss the people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lazy Creek wines are sold by mailing list, at the winery in Philo,
Calif., and at a few wine shops including Red Carpet Wines in
Glendale, Wine Country in Signal Hill and Morry's of Naples in Long
Beach. The winery is usually open for tasting 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily, but it's best to call ahead: (707) 895-3623.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of California's leading wineries, Beaulieu Vineyard, has a
serious problem with chemical contamination, according to an
investigation by Wine Spectator magazine. The chemical,
2,4,6-trichloroanisole, or TCA, is common and not harmful to humans,
but at high levels it does impart a bad "corky" odor to wine.</LD>
<LD>   Puzzled by recurring "corkiness" in BV wines during tasting
panels, the Spectator sent samples to a chemical testing laboratory.
It found that the BV wines contained levels of TCA almost three times
that of normal.</LD>
<LD>   Beaulieu Vineyard, located in Rutherford in the Napa Valley, has
been one of California's most important wineries since its founding
more than 100 years ago. It produces more than 1 million cases of
wine a year.</LD>
<TE>   BV is removing all wine from the suspect area of the winery and
has ventilated that area to remove any trace of the chemical, a
spokesman says. Standard practice in the wine business is for a
replacement or full refund to be offered for corky wines at the point
of sale. Beaulieu Vineyard also says it will offer that directly to
consumers.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Made from Russian River valley grapes, which produce some of the best
Pinot Noirs in California, this one is a California classic, with a
delicate scent of raspberry, clean bright fruit, fine-spun texture
and a discreet touch of oak. At this price, it's a steal. This is one
to buy by the case: It suits any occasion. How often do you find an
everyday wine that's good enough for company, but also inexpensive
enough to lavish on a boeuf bourguignon?</LD>
<LD>   If you can't find this one, try Castle Rock's 2001 Pinot Noir
"Napa," also very good and in the same price range.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The perfume of this Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc doesn't carry a whiff
of Sancerre's classic pungency. It doesn't smell California grassy,
either. Its scent is more what you'd get if you pressed your nose up
to the skin of a grapefruit -- citrusy with a backbeat of bitter.</LD>
<LD>   De Sante makes serious Sauvignon Blanc, intense in fruit with a
strong spine of acidity and a lovely lime aftertaste. And for a
California Sauvignon Blanc, it's refreshingly dry -- all the better
for pairing with food. Of course, you can never go wrong with goat
cheese.</LD>

<HD>2 Men Accused of Cheating Adelphia Out of $2.1 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Two men have been accused of bilking cable television provider
Adelphia Communications Corp. out of $2.1 million by infiltrating the
company and then having it pay for unauthorized consulting work.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury Friday indicted a former employee of
Adelphia's Buffalo, N.Y., office as well as a Santa Cruz businessman
on charges that they set up a complex network of bank accounts and
phony identities to conceal the payments.</LD>
<LD>   The businessman, Daniel Wirth, 44, was planning to surrender to
FBI agents in California, authorities said. He allegedly had been
hired as a consultant to Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable
company.</LD>
<TE>   Wirth's attorney said Tuesday that the payments were legitimate
and his client's contract to perform work for Adelphia was legal.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said the Adelphia employee had been using the
name John Wayne Truelove, but they believe he had assumed that
identity from a 4-year-old New York boy who died in 1959. Authorities
said they were trying to determine the man's identity.</TE>
<TE>   From September 2001 to March 2002, the man, who began working at
Adelphia in 1999, used his position to make 12 payments to Wirth
totaling $2.1 million, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   The man known as Truelove was in custody in Lehigh County, Pa., on
an unrelated charge of giving a fake name to authorities
investigating a fire at his home.</TE>
<TE>   Truelove's attorney, Barnaby Wittels, said the man's birth name is
Joseph Horvath. Wittels declined to address the specific charges
against his client.</TE>
<TE>   An Adelphia spokesman said the company was cooperating with the
investigation but declined to discuss the details of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The case is unrelated to federal charges that Adelphia's founder,
John Rigas, two of his sons and other former executives looted the
company of $2.5 billion and used the cash to finance personal
business ventures. Adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection this
year.</TE>

<HD>Abrupt Departure by Gill Surprises Many at Miramax</HD>
<DH>Head of movie company's Los Angeles office is forming a
production outfit with Mark Gordon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Gill stood before a packed audience at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art's Bing Theater on Monday night to introduce "Frida," a
pet project he had shepherded as president of Miramax Films' Los
Angeles office.</LD>
<LD>   Little did the crowd know that the upcoming movie starring Salma
Hayek as the long-suffering Mexican artist Frida Kahlo would be
Gill's swan song at Miramax.</LD>
<LD>   Gill, who served as executive producer on "Frida," announced
Tuesday that he was leaving Miramax after nearly eight years to start
his own production company. The news caught many at Miramax by
surprise even though it was widely known within the Walt Disney
Co.-owned movie company that Gill had been unhappy for some time.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said that for months there has been friction between Gill
and Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein concerning Gill's future role
at the company. Earlier this year, Gill explored various other job
options and had talks with Warner Bros. about the studio's
long-desired plans to start a specialty film label to compete with
rivals such as Fox Searchlight, Paramount Classics and Sony Classics.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said when Weinstein learned of the talks, he was furious
but attempted to persuade Gill to stay by offering him a new deal.
Gill, who never received a formal offer from Warner Bros., told
friends and associates that he expected to stay and was ironing out
the details.</TE>
<TE>   While Gill would not comment on the negotiations, sources said the
deal would allow him to take a greater role in the areas he preferred
most, the development, production and acquisition of movies, and
would incrementally increase his pay every year. But sources said
Weinstein reneged on that offer and instead wanted him to expand his
marketing responsibilities by becoming the president of worldwide
marketing, a job Gill rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax spokesman Matthew Hiltzik also declined to discuss the
negotiations, but acknowledged that Gill and management differed over
his future at the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted him to focus completely on marketing, and Mark was
interested in productions and acquisitions," Hiltzik said.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein released a statement praising Gill: "We have the highest
respect for Mark's skills and abilities....This was an amicable
parting."</TE>
<TE>   However, Miramax executives were surprised to learn Tuesday that
Gill had issued a news release announcing his plans to form a
production company with Mark Gordon ("The Patriot," "Saving Private
Ryan," "Speed") and financier Bob Yari. Gill will serve as president
of the newly named venture, Stratus Film Co., which hopes to
co-finance, produce and make equity investments in movies in the
$10-million to $40-million range. The company has yet to secure
financing or a distribution deal with a studio. Separately, Gordon
will continue to produce movies under his existing company, Mark
Gordon Co., which has a first-look deal at 20th Century Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "My contract ends here [at Miramax] on Friday. I start Monday with
the new company," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Gill, noting that "opportunities like this are few and far
between," said he hopes to make movies like the ones he was involved
with at Miramax, including "Frida" and "Next Stop, Wonderland," on
which he served as executive producer, and in the acquisitions of "In
the Bedroom" and "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   Gill joined Miramax in 1994 as head of marketing, based at its New
York headquarters. Three years later, Gill relocated to Southern
California and was named president of Miramax's Los Angeles office
with responsibilities for development, production, post production
and acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Before Miramax, Gill worked at Columbia Pictures and sister studio
TriStar Pictures for six years, rising to senior vice president of
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Anita M. Busch contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Bali Bombing Dashes Hopes for Indonesian Recovery</HD>
<DH>Attack came just as the economy appeared to be turning
around, the leader of a business group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As leading U.S. investors in Southeast Asia met last month on the
resort island of Bali, they were heartened by recent improvements in
Indonesia's long-troubled economy, including increased spending on
computers and consumer goods.</LD>
<LD>   But last weekend's nightclub bombing, which killed at least 188
people, has dashed hopes for a near-term recovery given the damage
inflicted on the country's tourism industry, its third-largest source
of revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The blast also is expected to scare away badly needed foreign
investment.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw Indonesia making the turn, though we were well aware of
the risk and the security situation," said Ernest Bower, president of
the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, who was at last month's meeting. "We
thought investment would actually pick back up this year."</TE>
<TE>   The council promotes business between the United States and the
Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations. Its board of directors includes
executives from Unocal Corp., General Electric Co., Goldman Sachs
Group and Boeing Co.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's attack, which has been tied to Islamic terrorists,
dashes the hope that new funds will flow into Indonesia and increases
the likelihood that frightened locals will ship their money out, at
least in the short term. Before the attack, economists had predicted
that Indonesia's economy, which has been struggling since the 1997
financial crisis, would expand by as much as 4.5% this year. Those
estimates are being revised downward by the day.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's well-being is of great concern to California firms
such as Unocal Corp., ChevronTexaco Corp. and Edison Mission Energy,
which are among the country's leading U.S. investors. California
tourists, particularly surfers and well-heeled travelers, also are
heavily represented among the 1.5 million people who visit Indonesia
each year, with Bali ranking among the most popular destinations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that it will be fairly devastating," said Jack
Daniels, an American living in Bali whose small tour company, Bali
Discovery Tours, has been hit by cancellations from nervous foreign
clients. "We will suffer, but as surely as New York has crawled back,
we will, too."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. business leaders and analysts said the weekend tragedy could,
however, improve Indonesia's economic prospects if President Megawati
Sukarnoputri begins taking the threat of Islamic fundamentalism
seriously and improves security, particularly around highly visible
foreign operations. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim
country. After Saturday's blast, the Indonesian government increased
protection at large U.S. energy facilities and began giving foreign
executives in Jakarta regular security updates.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the most optimistic spin, this could strengthen Megawati
and isolate Islamic fundamentalists," said Donald Emmerson, director
of the Southeast Asia Forum at Stanford University. "Under those
conditions, the security of foreign investments will improve. But
we've got a long way to go from here."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. firms already operating in Indonesia are accustomed to risk
and uncertainty, which is why few are expected to leave the country
unless the situation worsens dramatically. The Indonesian economy is
heavily dependent on energy exports, and U.S. energy firms lead
foreign investments in oil and natural gas production and electric
power generation. Chevron's Caltex Pacific Indonesia operations are
the country's largest foreign revenue earner and account for nearly
half of Indonesia's crude-oil production.</TE>
<TE>   Energy firms are used to dangerous conditions because they often
find themselves seeking oil or gas reserves in politically unstable
regions. Last year, Exxon Mobil Corp. shut down its natural gas
operation in the Indonesian province of Aceh for four months after it
was caught in a battle between the military and insurgents.</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. firms such as Nike Inc., IBM Corp., Motorola Inc., and
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. have used Indonesia as a low-cost production
base for decades, sticking out the political instability that
followed the financial collapse of 1997 and the ensuing violence and
anti-Chinese riots that led to the ouster of former President
Suharto.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, firms such as Cisco Systems Inc. have seen
their sales in Indonesia grow at a healthy pace as the domestic
economy began to turn around, according to the U.S.-ASEAN Business
Council.</TE>
<TE>   But Indonesia's economic prospects have suffered from the
political instability. In addition, the funds flowing out of
Indonesia have been greater than the investment coming in.</TE>
<TE>   James Castle, founder of a consulting firm based in Jakarta, said
foreign investors are looking for solid evidence that President
Megawati is ready to tackle some of the problems that have scared
foreign investors away, including onerous tax policies, a weak
judiciary and foot-dragging on privatization of protected industries.</TE>

<HD>Suit Seeks to Block Digital TV Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Consumer Electronics Assn. has asked a federal appeals court to
overturn the Federal Communications Commission mandate that nearly
all television sets be equipped with digital tuners by 2007.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed without fanfare at the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia on Friday, pits some set manufacturers
against TV broadcasters, which lobbied for the mandate. But the CEA
itself is divided over the issue, with some manufacturers opposing
the lawsuit and urging the group to withdraw it.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC ordered manufacturers in August to add digital tuners to
their sets starting in 2004. The mandate was part of the FCC's
ongoing effort to shift the country from analog to digital
broadcasting, which enables better picture and sound quality, more
channels and new services.</LD>
<TE>   About 500 TV stations are transmitting in digital, yet relatively
few consumers can tune in to their local digital channels.
Broadcasters say a tuner mandate is needed to build the audience for
digital channels and help them recover their investment. But Gary
Shapiro, chief executive of the CEA, said the FCC doesn't have the
authority to order such a dramatic change.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like the government telling us what we must make," said
Shapiro, who contends that the mandate might add as much as $200 to
the cost of a set. Broadcasters argue the amount might be a few
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is drawing flak from at least two set manufacturers:
Zenith Electronics Corp., which collects a licensing fee on digital
tuners, and Thomson Multimedia, which makes sets under the RCA brand.</TE>
<TE>   David H. Arland, director of government and public relations for
Thomson Multimedia, said his company will go along with a tuner
mandate if the FCC clears the way for cable-ready digital TVs.
Consumers want TVs that can receive premium and digital cable
channels without a converter box, Arland said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Perry, vice president of marketing for Mitsubishi
Digital Electronics America, said a tuner mandate wouldn't benefit
the 70% of viewers who get their channels from cable or satellite.</TE>

<HD>Records of 70 Companies Sought in Offshore Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service is seeking to force at least 70
companies, including Hilton Hotels Corp. and Walt Disney Co., to turn
over records as part of an expanded probe into credit card holders
who use offshore bank accounts to evade taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The tax agency wants judges to order airlines, hotels, car
dealerships and sports teams to turn over customer records so
investigators can identify holders of credit cards linked to offshore
accounts. The companies aren't accused of any wrongdoing, IRS
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "Our goal is simple and straightforward -- identify the people who
may be using these offshore cards to evade paying their taxes," IRS
Commissioner Charles Rossotti said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The agency is broadening its probe of people buying goods or
services with funds from offshore accounts. Investigators went to
court Aug. 29 seeking customer records from more than 40 companies.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the congressional auditing agency,
estimates that offshore accounts are used by 1 million to 2 million
U.S. taxpayers. Only 117,000 Americans disclosed they had offshore
accounts in 1999, the last year for which statistics are available,
the IRS said earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The tax collector previously has forced credit card companies Visa
International Inc., MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co. to turn
over information on cardholders in Antigua, Barbuda, the Bahamas and
the Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Disney declined to comment on whether the media
company would cooperate with the records request. Marc Grossman, a
spokesman for Beverly Hills-based Hilton, said the hotel company has
not received an IRS request.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online on Tuesday introduced software
with features for high-speed Web access and will eliminate most
"pop-up" ads, the latest efforts by the No. 1 Internet service
provider to reverse slowing growth.</LD>
<LD>   Pop-up ads, or advertisements that spring up on customers'
computer screens, are being cut because an increasing number of users
said they don't like them, America Online Chief Executive Jonathan
Miller said.</LD>
<LD>   America Online's new Version 8.0 adds features meant to attract
consumers who want high-speed Web access, a potential growth area
beyond the service's current 35 million users. America Online
typically debuts software in the fourth quarter to attract customers
before the holiday computer-buying season. Analysts said it's
difficult to link sales and new software.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based AOL Time Warner rose 81 cents to $12.13
in New York Stock Exchange trading. They've declined 62% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet service had projected that pop-up ads next year would
generate $30 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, or EBITDA, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The company intends to recover that by tapping new revenue
sources, even though it expects ad sales to decline in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   America Online will continue to run pop-up ads until current
contracts expire, Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Rite Aid Confirms FTC Privacy Probe</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CAMP HILL, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Rite Aid Corp. confirmed Tuesday that it is being investigated by the
Federal Trade Commission to determine whether the third-largest U.S.
drugstore chain violates consumer privacy guidelines through its
prescription refill reminder service.</LD>
<LD>   The company hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing and is
cooperating with the probe, Rite Aid said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "The FTC has asked for documents pertaining to refill reminders
made to patients either by phone or by mail and for educational
material related to drugs, including safety information," said Karen
Rugen, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill.</LD>
<TE>   She also emphasized that the company is not accused of any
wrongdoing and that it is fully cooperating with the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   Florida regulators this year investigated rival drugstore chain
Eckerd, which is owned by J.C. Penney Co., for similar reasons.</TE>
<TE>   As in Rite Aid's case, regulators sought to determine whether
Eckerd's customers were adequately informed that they were
authorizing the release of information for marketing purposes when
they signed prescription pickup logs and forms. That probe was
settled in July.</TE>
<TE>   FTC spokesman Mitch Katz confirmed that the agency was
investigating Rite Aid. He declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In June, former Rite Aid Chief Executive Martin Grass and three
other former top executives were indicted on criminal charges of
accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid ultimately agreed to concessions with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and paid $200 million to settle shareholder
lawsuits over the company's past accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid shares Tuesday fell 16 cents, or 7.6%, to $1.95 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fannie Mae's third-quarter earnings fell 19% after the largest buyer
of mortgages wrote down the value of derivatives used to protect it
from interest rate swings.</LD>
<LD>   The $1.38-billion write-down, brought on by the biggest quarterly
drop in Treasury note yields since 1986, helped reduce net income to
$994.3 million, or 98 cents a share, from $1.23 billion, or $1.19, a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding the loss, earnings rose 18% to $1.63 billion, or $1.62 a
share, sending the shares to their highest level in a month. Fannie
Mae shares rose $4.50 to $70.98 on the NYSE.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Southern California business consultant has agreed to plead
guilty to conspiring to obstruct the Securities and Exchange
Commission's investigation of a $593- million Ponzi scheme carried
out by money manager Reed E. Slatkin, federal prosecutors announced
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel W. Jacobs, 60, who now lives in Michigan, pretended to be a
representative of a Swiss financial institution purportedly holding
hundreds of millions of dollars in investor funds, according to his
plea agreement with prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobs faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. He also will be required to pay restitution of about
$1 million, the amount Slatkin gave him for his services. Slatkin, a
financial advisor to some of Hollywood's biggest stars, pleaded
guilty earlier this year to 15 criminal counts in connection with the
scam.</LD>

<LD>Charles Schwab Corp. reported its second quarterly loss in less than
a year, as the costs of shrinking its once-thriving online stock
brokerage continued to pile up.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company posted a third-quarter loss of $4
million, which broke even on a per-share basis. At the same time last
year, Schwab earned $13 million, or 1 cent a share.</LD>
<LD>   The loss included $160 million in charges to pay for another round
of mass layoffs and expenses stemming from the closure of offices
that Schwab no longer needs. If not for those charges, Schwab said,
it would have posted a profit of $96 million, or 7 cents a share.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc., the world's second-largest mobile phone maker, posted
a net profit in the third quarter that ended six straight quarters of
net losses, helped by gains in its mobile phone unit and a lower
restructuring charge.</LD>
<LD>   Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola reported a net profit of $111
million, or 5 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss a year ago of
$1.4 billion, or 64 cents a share. It said in July that it expected
net earnings of about 2 cents a share. Sales slid 14% to $6.4
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola shares were unchanged at $10.10 on the New York Stock
Exchange before results were announced. Shares fell 60 cents in
after-hours trading.</LD>

<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., the largest U.S. long-distance telephone company, asked
federal regulators to eliminate fees that U.S. local phone companies
charge other carriers to use their local networks.</LD>
<LD>   Companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp.
charged AT&amp;T and rivals $5 billion in such fees last year, AT&amp;T said.
AT&amp;T then passes along that cost to its customers.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC allowed local phone companies to charge the fees because
it anticipated more competition for local phone services, AT&amp;T said.
A series of bankruptcies among smaller local phone companies has
resulted in less competition, AT&amp;T said.</LD>

<HD>IRS Considers Debt Collectors</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service is considering the use of private
collection agencies to help it track down billions of dollars in
delinquent taxes, raising concern Tuesday from key lawmakers about
privacy and taxpayer protection.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee that oversees the IRS, said he is skeptical about putting
such powers in the hands of for-profit businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, IRS officials concluded after a preliminary
analysis that use of collection agencies "is a feasible,
cost-effective approach" to tackling some delinquent accounts,
according to congressional testimony.</LD>
<TE>   The Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, is still
mulling over the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
recently estimated that at least $20 billion in unpaid taxes could be
readily collected but is not being pursued.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, which first reported Tuesday on the
possible use of collection agencies, used an estimate of $240 billion
in delinquent taxes. Much of that is not collectible because
taxpayers have died.</TE>
<TE>   If the Treasury Department decides to use collection agencies, it
will confront a host of privacy and taxpayer protection questions.
Congress would have a say in approving such a program or in providing
its budget.</TE>
<TE>   "While it is prudent for the IRS to explore options ... any
proposal to amend tax laws to permit private debt collection would
have to be measured against the important privacy and safeguard
rights presently afforded taxpayers," Baucus said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Use Box Office to Help Back $1 Billion in Bonds</HD>
<DH>The media giant is considering the plan, sources say. Two
banks extend a $1.62-billion credit facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anthony Hopkins thriller "Red Dragon" has killed at the box
office, garnering more than $63 million for Universal Pictures in the
last 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   That's fortunate for parent Vivendi Universal: Vivendi is
considering using box-office receipts to help back about $1 billion
in bonds the company plans to issue as it restructures its finances,
said sources familiar with the plan. The company declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi's lenders are arranging the bond issue as part of a deal
to extend a $1.62-billion loan, which Vivendi received in May to buy
Barry Diller's USA film and television properties. On Tuesday,
Vivendi announced that J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America
Corp. had agreed to extend the loan repayment eight months until June
30.</LD>
<TE>   Using ticket sales as part of a financing tool, though common at
studios such as Walt Disney Co. in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is
rare in today's Hollywood, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders prefer to back loans with hard assets, such as a film
library or real estate, because of the risk involved, said veteran
film financier Lewis Horwitz. "You can produce a film for $60
million, put another $30 million into prints and advertising and get
nothing back."</TE>
<TE>   In Vivendi's case, the unusual financing may reflect the company's
strained balance sheet and delays in the sale of publishing and other
assets, said J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Harrington. "They are trying to
be as creative as they can to strengthen their short-term cash
position," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares climbed $1.02, or 8%, to $13.14 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Tuesday after the French newspaper La Tribune
reported that Vodafone Group of Britain might make a bid for the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers and analysts, however, dismissed that prospect,
saying such a deal would harm Vodafone's balance sheet and its
standing with shareholders. Vodafone and Vivendi are both interested
in upping their stakes in French telecom company Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Corie Brown contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>As Rally Continues, Treasury Yields Rise</HD>
<DH>The 10-year note soars to 3.99%, which could push up
interest rates and put an end to rush on mortgage refinancings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent surge in Treasury yields picked up steam Tuesday as
investors chasing a four-day stock rally on Wall Street fled the U.S.
government bond market.</LD>
<LD>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note soared to 3.99%
from Monday's close of 3.80% -- its biggest one-day rise on a
percentage basis since October 1998, when a Russian debt default
triggered the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a
prominent hedge fund.</LD>
<LD>   On Oct. 9, the 10-year T-note was yielding 3.57%, the lowest level
since the late 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   The spike in yields will push up a range of interest rates, from
consumer credit rates to corporate borrowing costs, and could bring
an end to the tide of mortgage refinancing that has helped support
consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Coming as it has from historically low yields, the snapback was
expected by many traders, especially as stocks fell to five-year lows
and panicked investors were moving money into the perceived safety of
fixed-income securities.</TE>
<TE>   "This was coming. We had six weeks of an equity sell-off and we
had bond markets being supercharged by equity weakness," said
Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed income at Bank Julius Baer.</TE>
<TE>   Rising yields can depress the value of existing bonds, which often
pay lower interest rates. Investors who need to sell their bonds
before maturity -- or who own bonds through mutual funds -- can lose
money during a period of rising interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether the rise in yields has much further to run.
Besides weak stock prices, a sour outlook for corporate earnings and
tepid U.S. economic growth were pushing down yields as investors bet
the Federal Reserve would trim interest rates again to spur growth.</TE>
<TE>   But the outlook for corporate profits remains uncertain, despite
some upbeat reports Tuesday. After the closing bell, Intel Corp., the
world's biggest chipmaker, said its third-quarter earnings missed
Wall Street estimates and lowered its plans for capital expenditures.
That sparked a sell-off in Intel shares in after-hours trading, as
well as some late buying in Treasuries.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating firm, Tuesday launched a
corporate governance practice and unveiled a study that ranks
companies in the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index by their "transparency and
disclosure."</LD>
<LD>   The move comes amid continuing debate about how to bolster
investor confidence and improve the way publicly traded companies
report information that affects their business, as investors struggle
to make sense of financial collapses such as those of Enron Corp. and
WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Using a 1-to-10 ranking -- with 10 representing the fullest and
clearest level of transparency and disclosure -- Standard &amp; Poor's
listed 98.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies as 7s or 8s overall, based on a
composite analysis of the companies' annual reports and other
regulatory filings.</LD>
<TE>   Only six companies in the index, which is home to 500 of the
largest public U.S. firms, received overall scores other than 7 or 8.</TE>
<TE>   The study hinged on 98 questions and looked at issues ranging from
ownership structure and investor rights to board management and
processes.</TE>

<HD>Banks Report Upbeat Profits in 3rd Quarter</HD>
<DH>Consumers' willingness to borrow despite a tough economy
helps offset increasing delinquencies and weak commercial lending.
Stock prices climb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Washington Mutual Inc. and
Citigroup Inc., fierce rivals for the huge California banking market,
reported robust third-quarter earnings Tuesday thanks largely to
record mortgage and credit-card lending, sending their stocks and
those of competitors up sharply.</LD>
<LD>   Profit warnings from J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of New York
Co., Comerica Inc. and others had depressed bank stocks this month,
but investors did an about-face Tuesday, lifting stocks of all 24
banks and thrifts in the Philadelphia KBW index higher. Shares rose
1.8% at Washington Mutual, 5.4% at Wells, 8.3% at Bank of America and
13% at Citigroup, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average.
Citigroup's increase helped power the Dow past 8,000 for the first
time in four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "The market had absolutely assumed the worst," said Richard
Kovacevich, chairman of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. "Today's
announcements said things aren't fabulous, but it's a lot better than
the market thought."</LD>
<TE>   Consumers' willingness to borrow despite the tough economy
overcame rising delinquencies and weak commercial lending. And the
flow of money out of stocks and into low- and no-interest bank
accounts provided cheap funds for such banks as BofA and Wells Fargo
and such thrifts as Washington Mutual, which have the most California
branches.</TE>
<TE>   "These things work together in ways to allow pretty phenomenal
results even in difficult economies," Kovacevich said.</TE>
<TE>   * Wells Fargo, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, reported third-quarter
profit of $1.44 billion, or 84 cents a share, up 10% from $1.31
billion, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier, when adjusted for an
accounting change. The booming market for mortgages and home-equity
lines lifted consumer lending 24%.</TE>
<TE>   Wells said it picked up some new business customers, but total
demand for commercial loans remained flat. Wells' stock gained $2.55
to $49.78.</TE>
<TE>   * Earnings at Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the nation's
biggest retail bank, jumped to $2.24 billion, or $1.45 a share, from
$841 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier, when its earnings
reflected $1.25 billion in costs related to its exit from the auto
leasing and subprime consumer lending businesses.</TE>
<TE>   BofA's profit from global corporate and investment banking fell
18%, but Chief Financial Officer James Hance said the bank sees
glimmers of a pickup in commercial demand. The bank's stock jumped
$5.04 to $65.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Seattle-based Washington Mutual said profit rose to $976
million, or $1.01 a share, up 7% on a per-share basis from
year-earlier earnings of $832 million, or 94 cents a share. Loan
volume rose 34%. The thrift's shares climbed 57 cents to $32.70.</TE>
<TE>   * New York's Citigroup, the nation's largest financial
conglomerate, reported earnings rose 23% to $3.92 billion, or 76
cents a share, from $3.18 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier.
Profit from credit cards, consumer loans and branch-banking rose 13%
to a record $2.2 billion, overcoming a drop in investment banking and
growing loan losses.</TE>
<TE>   Results beat analysts' expectations of 73 cents a share. That was
welcome news at Citigroup, which recently has suffered from
accusations that its securities analysts had conflicts of interest,
investigations of ties to corporate accounting scandals, and
community-group objections to its planned takeover of California
Federal Bank parent Golden State Bancorp, which would increase its
California offices from 77 to nearly 500. Citigroup's stock gained
$3.83 to $34.14.</TE>
<TE>   Today's earnings reports will include Downey Financial Corp. in
Newport Beach, UnionBanCal Corp. in San Francisco, City National
Corp. in Beverly Hills and Comerica Inc. in Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Beckman Shares Plunge as Sales Slow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beckman Coulter Inc. shares fell as much as 25% after the company
said third-quarter net income was down 2% to 3% on fewer sales to
drug makers.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Fullerton-based maker of laboratory equipment fell
$8.71 to $28.42 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier
dropping to $27.77. The plunge is the company's biggest since it was
spun off from Smithkline Beecham in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The company had net income of 52 cents a share in the year-
earlier quarter and had forecast profit of 62 cents for the quarter
that ended last month. The announcement comes three months after
company officials raised profit and sales estimates.</LD>
<TE>   "Missing numbers is one thing, but not even explaining what's
going on is another," said James McGlynn, manager of Summit Everest
Fund, which owns 27,000 Beckman Coulter shares.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter sales were $501 million, lower than the $520-million
estimate Chief Financial Officer Amin Khalifa gave in July, the
company said. Beckman Coulter sales fell as companies cut spending
for research equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The company said profit, excluding some costs, rose 8%. The
company had a $4-million write-down from an investment in a
biotechnology company in addition to costs to hedge against
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Jeanie Herbert didn't provide the amount of the costs,
which she said were partially offset by "higher than anticipated tax
deductions and credits in the quarter." The company's tax rate was
reduced to 27% from 30% for the period.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman Coulter will release complete results for the quarter Oct.
25, Herbert said.</TE>

<HD>Glitch at CalFed Blocks Accounts</HD>
<DH>ATM/Visa check cards are deactivated amid merger
preparations. About 9,000 accounts will be reactivated today.</DH>

<LD>Elvis Schmiedekamp never planned on this.</LD>
<LD>   California Federal Bank, which features Schmiedekamp on billboards
and in radio ads touting its customer service, left more than 9,000
customers stranded without access to their cash over the weekend
after their ATM/Visa check cards were mistakenly canceled, CalFed
executives said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In anticipation of its pending takeover by Citigroup Inc., CalFed
officials decided to change account numbers and issue new cards for
about 13,000 CalFed customers whose account numbers overlapped with
accounts at Citigroup, the nation's largest bank.</LD>
<TE>   However, because of a "programming glitch," cards were deactivated
Friday for about 9,000 customers, said Janis Tarter, spokeswoman for
San Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp, the parent of California
Federal Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The cards can be used to make debit and credit purchases and to
get cash from automated teller machines.</TE>
<TE>   "We apologize sincerely for the error," Tarter said. "Once the
merger closes, we wanted to make sure we had taken care of everything
in advance to minimize disruption."</TE>
<TE>   The glitch apparently angered many customers, especially
small-business account holders such as Ranee A. Spina, who lined up
at a CalFed office in Los Angeles on Tuesday to get access to her
money.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just in shock. We had people who couldn't check out of
hotels, [we had] cards declined at restaurants," said Spina, creative
director and founder of Urban Art Design Works, an advertising design
firm in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all getting declined and I said, 'What do you mean, I
know how much money is in this account.' Whoever made this decision
needs to be fired."</TE>
<TE>   Accounts were expected to be reactivated today. However, customers
still having trouble should call (800) THE-BANK, Tarter said.</TE>
<TE>   The merger between CalFed and Citigroup is pending regulatory
approval. Citigroup offered in May to buy Golden State, and
shareholders approved the merger in August.</TE>
<TE>   Glitches by banks during a merger are nothing new, industry
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd like to think it's unusual, but when a huge company like
CalFed makes a tiny glitch, it affects a huge number of people," said
Charlotte Chamberlain, a bank analyst in Los Angeles for investment
bank Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual Inc., which has become the nation's largest
savings and loan through a series of acquisitions, drew criticism
this year from customers of Dime Bancorp in New York, which
Washington Mutual acquired in January, according to published
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints included discontinued or lost savings and checking
accounts, the failure of ATM and debit cards to arrive in the mail,
and additional fees being attached to commercial accounts.</TE>
<TE>   A Washington Mutual official was quoted as saying that integrating
systems "can be overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Jenette Gayer, a consumer advocate for the California Public
Interest Research Group, said her group believes that "as banks get
bigger, service goes down and fees go up" because competition
declines and bureaucracy increases.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Carpenter, chairman of Carpenter &amp; Co., an Irvine-based
investment bank specializing in financial services, said it would be
unusual in a merger of CalFed and Citigroup's size if nothing went
wrong. But he said it gives smaller banks a chance to attract a large
bank's unhappy customers.</TE>
<TE>   "These kinds of glitches do provide opportunities for aggressive
competitor banks," Carpenter said.</TE>
<TE>   Spina said she is considering changing accounts because such
problems can hurt her business.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks should consider it a privilege to hold our money for us,"
Spina said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more small business in Los Angeles than large ones.
You'd think we'd be their top priority."</TE>
<TE>   As for Schmiedekamp, the thrift's head of customer service, "As
far as I know he didn't talk to any" angry customers over the
weekend, Golden State spokeswoman Tarter said.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Wants Pay, Results Linked at GE</HD>
<DH>Nation's biggest pension fund votes to co-sponsor a
shareholder proposal on executive salaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System voted Tuesday to
throw its financial muscle behind a shareholder proposal urging
General Electric Co. to link executive pay to performance in the wake
of recent disclosures of lavish payouts made to former GE Chief
Executive Jack Welch.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, the nation's largest pension fund with $135 billion in
assets, will co-sponsor the shareholder proposal with Amalgamated
Bank of New York Inc. A similar proposal by Amalgamated was defeated
by GE's shareholders last year.</LD>
<LD>   "The story of Mr. Welch highlights some of the excesses that have
existed in our marketplace," said California Treasurer Phil
Angelides, a CalPERS trustee. "As shareholders, we have a
responsibility and a right to restore rationality to the realm of
executive pay."</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS, which owns about $1.4 billion in GE stock, will ask GE
shareholders to ensure that future stock option grants to senior
executives are linked to company performance. The shareholder
resolution will be considered at the company's annual board meeting
in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the point at the last annual meeting--compensation at GE
is already closely linked to performance," said Dave Frail, a
spokesman for GE. "We do look forward to discussing this with CalPERS
and Amalgamated."</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, his last year as GE's CEO, Welch's pay package grew by
more than 80% to $16 million, even as the company's market value was
dropping. Welch, once considered a CEO role model for his work at GE,
has made headlines in recent weeks for a controversial retirement
benefits package that gave him free use of a company jet, a luxury
apartment in New York and even free flowers, wine and maid service.
These benefits, which Welch has agreed to relinquish, recently came
to light in a divorce filing by the 66-year-old former executive's
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan-based Amalgamated Bank, which invests workers'
retirement savings through its LongView funds, said it expects to
push for similar measures at other companies, given the current
crisis in investor confidence. Amalgamated files about 20 such
corporate responsibility-related proposals each year.</TE>
<TE>   "Executive compensation policies like those at GE are
inexcusable," said Amalgamated Bank Vice Chairman Bruce Raynor. "We
expect to win majorities this year -- especially since we are
partnering with CalPERS, a world leader in advocating for improved
corporate governance."</TE>
<TE>   Executive compensation issues are expected to heat up this year,
and many corporate activists and institutional investors will be
watching shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Before it was just 'yawn,' " when it came to executive
compensation, said Peg O'Hara, a managing director at the Council of
Institutional Investors, a trade group. "Now everyone is interested
in it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's a difficult problem, because linking pay to
performance is one of the reasons many CEOs rationalized large
bonuses and perks when their firms were growing, O'Hara said.</TE>
<TE>   In another action Tuesday, CalPERS voted to shift asset targets
for the first time in more than two years. CalPERS will reduce bond
holdings and put more money into private equity and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS said it would cut investments in global fixed-income
securities to 26% from 28%. It will lift targets for alternative
investments, such as venture capital and private equity, to 7% from
6% and raise real estate to 9% from 8% of assets. It voted to keep
U.S. stocks at 39%.</TE>

<HD>Delta's 3rd-Quarter Loss Widens to $326 Million</HD>
<DH>The airline is planning more job cuts to reduce costs amid
a persistent travel slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delta Air Lines, leading a parade of dismal third-quarter reports
expected from the airlines this week, on Tuesday posted a loss of
$326 million for the period and warned that more job cuts are ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's third-largest airline also plans to further pare its
flight schedule, defer delivery of 29 new jetliners and mothball its
fleet of 15 MD-11 jumbo jets as Atlanta-based Delta--like all the
carriers--slashes costs to match the persistent slump in air travel.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not see a near-term improvement," Michelle Burns, Delta's
chief financial officer, told analysts in a conference call. "We have
a daunting road ahead."</LD>
<TE>   With the exception of Southwest Airlines, most major carriers will
post third-quarter losses this week. The entire industry lost about
$1.6 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, analysts estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Delta's loss, equal to $2.67 a share, widened from a loss of $259
million, or $2.13 a share, a year earlier when the period included
the unprecedented shutdown of air travel after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Delta said revenue for the third quarter was flat at $3.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Delta Chairman Leo F. Mullin told analysts that the carrier's
losses "will require us to announce in the very near future, to our
utmost regret, staffing reductions beyond the 1,500 flight-attendant
positions throughout the company already indicated." He declined to
be more specific. Delta had 76,000 employees at the quarter's end,
7,000 fewer than a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The airline also said it had $1.7 billion of cash and aircraft
valued at about $5 billion that it could pledge for additional
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, analyst Jim Higgins of Credit Suisse First Boston said
Delta still could face a cash crunch because of its underfunded
pension plan and any further drop in travel caused by a war with
Iraq. "If our estimates on that front are close, a reasonable
forecast of the impact of an Iraqi war could place Delta on the brink
of bankruptcy," he said in a note to clients.</TE>
<TE>   But if Delta avoids that fate, its stock could benefit as Delta
slims down, he added. Indeed, despite the latest loss, Delta's stock
jumped $1.59 a share, or 21%, to $9.09 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest Internet marketing company, DoubleClick Inc., said
Tuesday that its third-quarter loss narrowed 40% after the sale of
its money-losing European unit. Sales during the quarter were down
19%, reflecting the continuing slump in online advertising.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company reported a loss of $62 million, or 46
cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a
loss of $103.5 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. When
DoubleClick announced last year that it would sell its European Media
operation, executives said 70% of the company's losses came from the
unit.</LD>
<LD>   DoubleClick, which was founded in 1996 and became a pioneer in Web
site advertising sales, now focuses on market research and e-mail
advertising campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter was $74.6 million, down nearly 20% from
$92.7 million in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares rose 7 cents Tuesday to $6.05 on Nasdaq before the
results were announced. It dipped as low as $5.17 in after-hours
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The earnings were well below the 1-cent gain estimated by analysts
surveyed by Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, DoubleClick announced it was teaming up with
software maker Macromedia Inc. to develop methods to create,
distribute and track online advertisements that feature animation and
other enhancements.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Macromedia created the widely used Flash
online animation technology.</TE>

<HD>Businesses Decrease Inventories in August</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Uneasy about the economic recovery, businesses trimmed their
stockpiles of unsold goods in August for the first time in four
months.</LD>
<LD>   Inventories on shelves and back lots edged down by 0.1% in August,
a turnaround from July when businesses boosted their stockpiles by a
solid 0.4%, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The decline represented the first time since April that
businesses, including retailers, pared inventories, suggesting that
companies wanted to keep stocks lean given economic uncertainties,
including possible war with Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it is a sign that businesses feel economic weakness is
going to persist for a while," said economist Clifford Waldman,
president of Waldman Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses' sales, meanwhile, grew by 0.2% in August, a slowdown
from the brisk 1.3% increase posted in July.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's report also showed that the inventory-to-sales ratio
fell to 1.34 months, a record low. That means it would take
businesses 1.34 months to exhaust inventories at the current sales
pace.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies have not bought into the recovery, so they want to keep
inventories extremely tight so as not to get left holding the bag,"
said economist Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers reduced their inventories by 0.3% and sales grew by
0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   At factories, inventories were flat in August as sales slid 0.6%.
But wholesalers increased stocks 0.2% as sales rose 0.9%.</TE>

<HD>Airplay Raises Disclosure Issue</HD>
<DH>Some say FM station Power 106 should tell listeners about
its ties to a rapper receiving heavy exposure. The station's owner
denies conflict of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shade Sheist is a hot act on Power 106, the most popular rap radio
station in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last month, KPWR-FM has launched three singles by the
little-known rapper and played them more than any station in the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   One reason, critics suggest, is that the man credited with
producing Sheist's "Informal Introduction" CD is a senior programming
and artist relations executive at KPWR named Damion Young. And Baby
Ree Entertainment, the company that recorded Sheist's CD, is financed
by Emmis Communications, an Indianapolis-based conglomerate that owns
KPWR-FM. Sheist's music is then distributed by MCA Records, an arm of
Vivendi Universal, the world's largest record corporation.</LD>
<TE>   Power 106, well-known to locals because of its ubiquitous
billboards touting its morning deejay Big Boy, has lured younger
listeners with a playlist that is heavy with rap stars such as
Eminem, Nelly and Snoop Dogg. But critics question whether it's legal
for a broadcast chain to underwrite an artist's recording and then
promote his music on its stations without notifying listeners about
its business ties.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't sound like radio programming," said Peter Hart, an
analyst for the New York-based media watchdog group Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting. "It sounds like a commercial for a company
tied to the owners of the station. Listeners should know that the
station has a financial stake in the programming. It calls for
disclosure."</TE>
<TE>   Hart characterized airplay of Sheist's music on KPWR as a
"dramatic" conflict of interest for Emmis.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Cummings, president of Emmis' radio division, disagreed.
"Before setting this record up, we cleared it with our legal counsel
and [Federal Communications Commission] attorneys. They said, 'Look,
make sure this thing passes the smell test. Remove Damion from the
decision-making process on the [Sheist] record.' And that's exactly
what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits radio stations from accepting money or
anything of value for playing songs without disclosing that
information to listeners. Officials with the FCC declined to comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The flap over Sheist's airplay is the latest in a series of
controversial issues plaguing the radio industry. Recently,
legislation was proposed in Congress to limit the number of stations
that radio giants can own and to ban deals that stations have with
independent record promoters, contending that they violate payola
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Communications Inc., the nation's biggest radio
company, has come under criticism in San Diego for sidestepping rules
that limit it from owning more than eight stations in a single market
by controlling the programming of five additional radio stations just
across the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   In other entertainment industries, the government does not
necessarily frown on media conglomerates owning content and
distribution. In the last decade as federal rules were relaxed, Walt
Disney Co. and Viacom Inc. were allowed to acquire ABC and CBS
respectively, and fill their networks with their own movies, sitcoms
and cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   In the music business, however, record companies want listeners to
believe stations play songs because they are popular, not because
they are paid advertisements. Although record companies collectively
spend more than $100 million a year behind the scenes to lobby
broadcasters for airplay, the labels go to great lengths to avoid
on-air identification tags.</TE>
<TE>   Some record labels sign deejays to artist's contracts and also pay
thousands of dollars in fees to programmers and other radio station
personnel to remix singles by other musicians. Privately, music
executives say such deals sometimes allow record labels to develop
closer relationships with broadcast employees who can influence
airplay of the remixed song.</TE>
<TE>   KPWR's Young, who is considered one of the most influential radio
executives in the country, has remixed tracks for record labels
ranging from Def Jam to Columbia, Atlantic and London-Sire before
cutting his current distribution deal with MCA. Young did not return
calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for MCA say the label signed its deal with Young
solely on the merits of Sheist's music.</TE>
<TE>   KPWR program director Jimmy Steal said the only reason he added
Sheist to the station's weekly playlist was because it rated high in
listener tests used to judge audience response to all new music.
Emmis' Cummings said Sheist's songs tested well at two other stations
in the radio chain, which also added the songs to their playlists.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings said Young has been prohibited from discussing Sheist's
music during KPWR's weekly programming meetings. He also said that no
Emmis employee asked its stations to air Sheist's music.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five weeks KPWR played Sheist's first single, "Money
Owners," about 380 times, nearly triple the amount of the 30 other
stations across the nation that aired it, according to Broadcast Data
Systems. The song aired 106 times on an Emmis-owned station in New
York and 97 times on another company station in Phoenix. Only two
non-Emmis stations played "Money Owners" more than 50 times.</TE>
<TE>   "KPWR is No. 1 in this market out of 80 stations," Cummings said.
"Emmis can't afford to play music that doesn't test well with our
listeners."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the heavy airplay at some Emmis stations, Sheist's CD is a
commercial flop, selling fewer than 10,000 copies since its Sept. 10
release, according to Nielsen/SoundScan.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Loosen Two Sides' Tight Grip on Ports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So who has grounds to be outraged over what's happening at West Coast
ports -- labor or management? It turns out, neither. The party
getting the rawest deal, as the two sides squabble, is the American
public.</LD>
<LD>   With this in mind, federal officials are starting to move forward
with regulations and possibly new legislation designed to prevent
future crippling disputes, even as Washington copes with the present
impasse.</LD>
<LD>   Although the ports are operating again, after President Bush
invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to end a 10-day port closure, the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the shipping lines
and terminal operators of the Pacific Maritime Assn. remain bitterly
divided in their battle over control of jobs and the movement of
cargo at the ports.</LD>
<TE>   But that notion of control is ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   What both sides refuse to recognize is that they have no right to
"control" the giant public facilities that are the great ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, as well as other docks stretching from San
Diego to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of billions of taxpayer dollars have been invested in L.A.
and Long Beach to deepen their channels and make them suitable for
the massive container ships that now carry the world's goods.</TE>
<TE>   The ports and related facilities, such as the $2.4-billion Alameda
Corridor built at public expense, have made Southern California a hub
of the global economy. Parts for cars and computers, food and
clothing pass through these ports to factories and stores across the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   As the volume of trade has grown -- to more than $220 billion
through Southern California last year -- port disputes have evolved
from local labor-management clashes into grave threats to the
national economy.</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely why Washington, looking beyond the White House's
action last week, now is contemplating additional steps to forestall
future disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of these measures are sure to face stiff union
opposition, they're a needed insurance policy for an economy that
simply can't afford to be brought to a halt by labor strife.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta, for one, is being urged by a
group of rail, truck and shipping companies to consider a form of the
Railway Labor Act of the 1920s, which imposes compulsory arbitration
on labor disputes that endanger the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   That request, from the 30-member National Marine Systems National
Advisory Council, is being passed on to the Labor Department and
National Labor Relations Board, which administer the Taft-Hartley Act
and related laws.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some tough questions recently were raised by Rep. Don
Young (R.-Alaska) regarding the inordinate control of West Coast
ports by the</TE>
<TE>   ILWU and the PMA management group.</TE>
<TE>   Although no legislation was proposed during the current session to
try to loosen the shackles that the two sides have placed on the
docks, the issue is sure to surface again in the new Congress, which
will take office in January.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the problem is the inability of union and management
to cooperate over changes in technology. Both the 10,500-member ILWU
and the PMA, representing 76 shipping lines and related businesses,
have acted in ways that, while useful in a street fight, are
counterproductive to the interests of the communities dependent on
the ports. The tensions are deeply rooted in history.</TE>
<TE>   Union clerks interrupt data streaming over the Internet from
across the world and then painstakingly re-enter it into computers at
the ports. Conceding that this process is cumbersome and uneconomic,
the union says it is willing to give up the practice and accept the
loss by retirement of a certain number of clerk positions.</TE>
<TE>   As compensation, however, the ILWU demands that it gain control
over other positions, such as the "planners" who direct where cargo
is placed in containers and where the containers are placed on ships.
"Planner" was a union job when cargo consisted of separate boxes and
packages at dockside.</TE>
<TE>   "Placing cargoes was always a clerk's job on the ports," says
Steve Stallone, chief spokesman for the ILWU. "It is our job and we
want it back."</TE>
<TE>   But today, cargo arrives and departs in containers that are
arranged by computer software systems, often operated in the offices
of shipping lines. Not surprisingly, many of the major shipping lines
-- most of them foreign-owned -- have closed their Los Angeles and
Long Beach offices and moved those operations to Utah, Colorado,
Arizona and Texas, to escape the jurisdiction of the ILWU.</TE>
<TE>   To the shipping lines, "planners are management employees," says
Joseph Miniace, president of the PMA. "The union can try to organize
them if it wants, but we cannot hand over their representation."</TE>
<TE>   The enmity between the two sides is palpable. Small wonder that
five months of negotiations have produced no agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations, with a federal mediator now in the middle, are set
to resume shortly as the 80-day clock of the cooling-off period
stipulated by Taft-Hartley ticks on. But how much progress can be
made is far from clear.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the ports have operated successfully despite the
lack of trust between labor and management because the growing flows
of trade and money have masked their hostility. Shipping lines made
concessions in previous contract talks to keep the goods moving.</TE>
<TE>   This year, confrontation replaced compromise as both sides sensed
a need to make changes to accommodate technology and prepare for even
greater volumes of trade. Yet failing a sudden burst of cooperation,
the federal government inevitably will be forced to govern what
happens at West Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   And for the public interest, that is surely best.</TE>

<HD>Asia Global Delays Some Note Payments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to preserve cash while it tries to raise additional funds,
Asia Global Crossing Ltd. said Tuesday that it is delaying interest
payments on its senior notes and renegotiating payment terms with two
of its contractors.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based subsidiary of Global Crossing Ltd. has been in
talks for months with potential buyers, but a bankruptcy filing still
is a possibility -- either as a last-ditch survival move or as part
of a turnaround package with new investors.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a multifaceted announcement, Asia Global also released
preliminary cash balance and revenue figures for the second and third
quarters, and said it hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to replace
longtime auditor Arthur Andersen.</LD>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the year, Asia Global has not been able to
certify its financial results because of ongoing investigations of
its booking of fiber-optic capacity deals involving Asia Global,
Global Crossing and other carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which owns almost 59% of Asia Global, is in
Bankruptcy Court and faces allegations that the company used sham
capacity deals to boost its earnings. Some of those deals involve
Asia Global, which operates a transoceanic network serving Singapore,
Hong Kong and other major locales in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global has been working to distance itself from its parent
company by seeking separate backers, restructuring its board and
recalculating revenue to exclude reciprocal capacity deals -- a move
Global Crossing has not yet taken. Gary Winnick, founder of both
companies, recently resigned from Asia Global's board.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it booked $32.1 million in sales for the third
quarter, up from $27.8 million the previous quarter. Asia Global's
available cash balance stands at $250.1 million, down from $253.5
million Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global said the figures have not been reviewed by its new
auditor, and are not comparable to previous years.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said its revenue figures do not include proceeds
from reciprocal sales or revenue owed it by Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   For the second time this year, Asia Global will take 30 additional
days before making its scheduled interest payment on $408 million in
senior notes.</TE>

pensions and its holdings in Hughes Electronics Corp. and Italian car
maker Fiat.</LD>
<LD>   GM on Tuesday reported a loss of $804 million, or $1.42 a share,
largely due to a $1.37-billion write-down of the value of its
investment in Fiat and other one-time charges. Its year-earlier loss
was $368 million, or 41 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, earnings were $615 million, or $1.20 a
share. A consensus of Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson First
Call expected GM to earn 99 cents a share, including the Hughes loss.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, GM sales for the quarter rose 3% to $43.58 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The world's largest automaker also raised its fourth-quarter and
full-year expectations. "Our confidence in the year remains very
strong, and that's reflected in these numbers," John Devine, GM's
chief financial officer, told analysts and reporters during a
conference call.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares rose $3.44, or 10%, to close at $36.70 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the positive news was tempered with negative reports about
pensions, the Hughes satellite TV business and Fiat.</TE>
<TE>   GM's third-quarter figures include results from Hughes, whose
proposed merger with EchoStar Communications Corp. was blocked last
week by federal regulators. Hughes, which said Monday that it would
aggressively try to salvage the merger, lost $81 million in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Another sour note was the 20% stake that GM bought in Fiat two
years ago. The huge write-down reflects the Italian automaker's
crumbling business amid slumping sales.</TE>

<HD>San Diego, O.C. to See Hotel Growth</HD>

<LD>Southern California's hotel industry will continue to recover next
year from the lingering travel downturn, but at a more modest pace
than previously expected because of a chilled economy, a stubborn
corporate travel slump and an influx of new, high-end resorts,
according to a report scheduled to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Occupancy rates at Los Angeles County hotels are expected to be
flat in 2003, and average room rates will decline 3% next year -- the
worst in the region -- because of poor convention business, a 15%
drop in international visitors and an unemployment rate that has
crept back to 1998 levels. The forecast, prepared by PKF Consulting,
projects occupancy in Los Angeles next year at 65.3%.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Baltin, a lodging expert with PKF Consulting who will
present the report at a tourism outlook conference today in Long
Beach, said L.A. hotels have found it difficult to raise room rates
without driving away customers.</LD>
<TE>   The average daily room rate in L.A. County is $117, down from $121
last year. Rates are expected to be flat in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us thought Los Angeles and Southern California overall
would recover more quickly than it has this year," Baltin said. "But
the industry is really taking its time coming back. At this rate we
won't be anywhere near 2000 levels for at least another year or
more."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's hotel occupancy is expected to average 66.3% next
year, up from 64% this year. Anaheim, with its strong convention
calendar and rebounding leisure market, stands to see the highest
boost in occupancy and room rates in 2003 -- to 66.4% and $90.50,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County, however, continues to be the second-strongest
hotel market in the country behind New York because of a newly
expanded convention center and strong drive-in market, Baltin said.
Occupancy is expected to average 73% next year, up from 71.5% this
year, while average room rates will rise more than 3% to $137.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego has been sitting pretty and is in a great position for
growth next year," Baltin said, noting the Super Bowl in January and
the development of a downtown ballpark for the San Diego Padres in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Beverly Hills-based Hilton Hotels Corp. said
the report's findings are in line with what they project next year at
the company's 55 properties in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, for example, Hilton's hotels have seen a nearly 80%
occupancy rate this year, said Dieter Huckestein, vice president of
hotel operations. And though prices have been softer this year,
Huckestein expects room rates to stabilize in 2003 as the travel
industry continues its recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I see an incremental, modest increase in our Southern California
properties next year," he said. "The further we move away from the
effects of [Sept. 11], and the more we take advantage of the region's
vast drive-in market, the better off we'll be."</TE>

<HD>Cutbacks Help Intel Increase Its Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. posted flat sales and higher profit as cost cutting by
the world's largest semiconductor maker helped compensate for tepid
back-to-school sales and a continued reluctance by businesses to
spend on new computer equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel posted a third-quarter profit of
$686 million, or 10 cents a share, up from $106 million, or 2 cents,
in the same period last year, when the industry was experiencing its
worst downturn ever. Sales for the quarter were $6.5 billion, on par
with $6.55 billion in revenue last year.</LD>
<LD>   Investors interpreted Intel's performance, announced after the
markets closed, as a sign that a recovery in the technology sector is
further off than expected. Intel shares dropped 13% to $14.39 in
extended trading after closing Tuesday at $16.52, up $1.42, on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   "The good news is that the market isn't contracting underneath
them anymore, and you're seeing the effects of cost management
boosting profits," said Martin Reynolds, vice president of Gartner
Inc., a technology research firm. "The bad news is that the market is
the same size it was last year, the worst year in the history of
semiconductors."</TE>
<TE>   On an operating basis, excluding special charges, Intel's
$786-million profit, or 11 cents a share, fell short of Wall Street's
expectations. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had projected 13
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The holidays are unlikely to bring much cheer. Intel Chief
Financial Officer Andy Bryant projected revenue to be $6.5 billion to
$6.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Although that's flat to 6% up
from third-quarter revenue, Intel typically gets a 10% to 15% boost
in the fourth quarter from the holiday buying surge. Intel also
lowered its gross margins projection to 49% from 51%.</TE>
<TE>   "The root of the problem is weak demand for personal computers,"
said Mark Edelstone, analyst for Morgan Stanley. "Intel is a
capital-intensive company, and if they can't drive sales, it hurts
their margins."</TE>
<TE>   For the last year and a half, Intel has cut costs by negotiating
lower prices from its suppliers and trimming its work force. It
reduced its capital spending estimate for the year to $4.7 billion
from its previous estimate of $5 billion to $5.2 billion, primarily
from lower construction costs. The company employs 81,700 workers,
down from a peak of 91,200 in March 2001. That has helped Intel boost
its net income amid stagnant sales.</TE>
<TE>   But the cost savings have "hit a wall," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Cost cutting can go only so far, analysts said. What's needed is a
resurgence in demand in PCs and other gadgets that require Intel's
memory and processing chips. When that will occur remains unclear as
analysts have been forced to push back their forecasts of a
technology sector revival practically every quarter this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is basically flat as a pancake this year," said
David Wu, chip analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
Wu said corporate spending on technology, primarily to replace aging
PCs that were last purchased in 1999 in preparation for the so-called
year 2000 bug, should return "no later than the third quarter of
2003." He quickly added, "It would be nice if that were actually
true."</TE>
<TE>   Still, amid lackluster demand, Intel gained market share at the
expense of its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which two
weeks ago warned of a "substantial operating loss" for its current
quarter. Intel's share of PC microprocessors gained 3 percentage
points to 86% for the third quarter, according to Mercury Research.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Surge for 4th Day on Earnings</HD>
<DH>Dow jumps 378 points after Citigroup, GM and others report
solid results. But analysts are reluctant to declare the bear market
over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks on Tuesday staged their biggest rally since the summer,
lifting the Dow industrials 378 points as investors cheered generally
upbeat third-quarter earnings reports from a variety of companies.</LD>
<LD>   But despite four straight winning sessions for stocks, analysts
remained reluctant to declare an end to the 31-month-old bear market.
The economy still looks shaky, and geopolitical tensions are on the
rise, they said, and after the close of trading, tech giant Intel
rattled nerves with a profit shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   "Four days of rally does not a new bull market make," said Kevin
Marder, strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Added Jon Burnham, manager of the Burnham Fund: "I'm impressed,
but I'm not convinced. I don't see how anything has changed since
last week. The economy still seems to have a lot of problems, and if
anything, the world situation is worse."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the rally that began Thursday continued for at least
another day, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging 378.28
points, or 4.8%, to 8,255.68 -- its biggest one-day gain since July
29. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 39.83 points, or
4.7%, to 881.27. The technology-loaded Nasdaq composite index notched
its biggest gain since Aug. 14, jumping 61.91 points, or 5.1%, to
1,282.44.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by about 3 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume was active.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields soared, meanwhile, as investors shifted money out
of government bonds and into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow and S&amp;P 500 index reached five-year lows Oct. 9, while
Nasdaq sank to a six-year low. Since then, the S&amp;P 500, considered by
many the best barometer for blue-chip stocks, has risen 13.5% in four
sessions. But it's still off 23.2% year to date as the market flirts
with a third straight losing year -- which hasn't happened since
1939-40, the early years of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Solid earnings reports from financial companies and other big
names sparked the day's gains, amounting to what Burnham called "a
sigh of relief" from investors who were braced for more bad news.
Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all matched or topped
profit expectations, helping lift an index of 24 major bank stocks
more than 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Solid earnings reports also boosted blue chips such as General
Motors, up $3.44 to $36.70; Maytag, up $3.45 to $24.02; and Johnson &amp;
Johnson, up $1.73 to $59.56.</TE>
<TE>   "Third-quarter earnings have shown some daylight," said Dennis
Ferro, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investments in
Charlotte, N.C. "But for this recovery to be meaningful, we need
validation on the economic front that business orders are picking up
and pricing is firming up."</TE>
<TE>   Ferro said he expects the flood of earnings reports this week and
next to "help tell the tale," along with economic data due this week,
including housing construction and industrial production figures
expected Thursday and inflation and trade numbers expected Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Since the third quarter began, overall profit growth estimates for
companies in the S&amp;P 500 have tumbled by two-thirds, from about 17%
to 5.5%, said Alan Skrainka, strategist at brokerage Edward Jones in
St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "When you set the bar of expectations so low, it's easy to step
over it," Skrainka said.</TE>
<TE>   After the close of regular trading, leading chip maker Intel
provided the freshest reminder of the economy's fragility, missing
analysts' consensus estimate and warning of soft demand from its
customers. Its shares, which rose $1.42 to $16.52 in Nasdaq trading,
tumbled 13% in after-hours trading, leading analysts to speculate
that tech stocks could face selling pressure today as traders take
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Tuesday's market rally prompted investors to move
assets out of perceived havens such as Treasury bonds and gold
stocks, the most defensive stock sector. The Amex index of gold
mining stocks fell 2.9% as gold prices fell $5.20 to $312.60 an ounce
in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Most encouraging was the message about the economy delivered by
the market -- that the chances for a 'double dip' recession have
waned," Ladenburg Thalmann's Marder said. "Cyclical" stock groups
such as retail, finance, transportation and home builders rallied
while defensive names lagged, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts say the steady sell-off from late August through
Oct. 9 left stocks overdue for at least a bounce. How long the bounce
lasts is anyone's guess, but Skrainka said one encouraging note is
that the market is heading into its strongest period historically --
November through January.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Mortgage giant Fannie Mae climbed $4.50 to $70.98 after topping
earnings forecasts, and elsewhere in the financial sector, insurance
stocks rallied after executives at several companies said they expect
to be able to raise premiums next year and possibly in 2004,
Bloomberg News reported. AIG jumped $5.70 to $64 and Ace rose $2.76
to $33.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas markets rallied. Key indexes rose 7% in Germany and
France, 5% in Britain and 1% in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   * In currency trading, the continuing strength on Wall Street gave
the U.S. dollar a boost against the euro and the yen.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Northwest Airlines Corp., expected to report its fourth straight
quarterly loss this week, said Tuesday it will close an Atlanta
maintenance base and a California reservation center to cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest will fire about 100 managers at both locations. About
1,450 workers in Atlanta will be laid off or transferred to other
plants. About 250 reservation agents in Long Beach will be able to
transfer to the airline's six other centers.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-largest U.S. carrier lost $264 million in the first
half, and analysts expect losses extended into the third quarter as
customers cut back on travel amid concerns about terrorist attacks
and a slowing economy.</LD>
<TE>   St. Paul-based Northwest plans the first round of layoffs in
Atlanta for mid-December and expects to complete the base shutdown by
Jan. 31.</TE>

<HD>Truckers Feeling Pinched at Ports</HD>
<DH>Shipping lines charge fees for equipment that drivers say
was held up because of congestion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trucking companies that suffered heavy losses during the 10-day
lockout of West Coast ports say they are being stung a second time by
shipping lines, which are charging rental fees for equipment the
truckers say they could not return on time.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called per diem fees can amount to $44 a day for a
container or the truck chassis that carries it, said Stephanie
Williams, vice president for legislative affairs with the California
Trucking Assn. The equipment is owned by the shipping lines and lent
to trucking companies for five days to allow time for delivery and
return.</LD>
<LD>   The tab can quickly escalate for companies with several hundred
containers and chassis on hand.</LD>
<TE>   Williams said truckers have had difficulties returning equipment
to terminals for more than a month because of labor disruptions that
slowed processing times and because of the lockout, which ended Oct.
9. In recent days, she said, some truckers have waited in line five
hours to return empty containers, only to be turned away from the
terminal gate because the yard already was too congested.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like Blockbuster Video taping up their video drop box and
then saying, 'You owe us money,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams singled out Taiwan-based shipping line Evergreen as one
of the worst offenders. However, Bob Kleist, a consultant for the
company, said Evergreen has waived per diem fees that built up during
the 10-day lockout, except for equipment that already was late before
it began.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping lines, through the Pacific Maritime Assn., have been
in tense contract negotiations with the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union for five months. After a series of alleged union
slowdowns, which snarled traffic on the docks, the shipping
association shut down all the West Coast ports. They were reopened
for an 80-day cooling-off period last week under a federal court
order sought by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The trucking association also complained about being charged
storage, or "demurrage," fees for containers that were destined for
importers but were stranded at the terminals. The California Port
Assn., which sets those fees, agreed last week to suspend the fees
through the lockout period. Demurrage fees can be as high as $72 a
day for a container.</TE>
<TE>   The union and shipping association continued to trade accusations
Tuesday regarding the pace of work at terminals along the coast. ILWU
Local 13 in Los Angeles filed the first stage of a grievance process
Tuesday, alleging that the shipping group was creating a crisis by
failing to order enough crane operators.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA said the union was staging orchestrated slowdowns, which
cut production along the coast Tuesday by 21% from normal.</TE>

<HD>Batons Vie to Be the Designated Hitter</HD>

<LD>The battle over bangers is inflating.</LD>
<LD>   As the Anaheim Angels and the San Francisco Giants prepare to
fight for the World Series crown, a rivalry is developing between the
two manufacturers of the plastic tube-shaped noisemakers that are the
rage of California baseball fans.</LD>
<LD>   CheerStix, a Beijing-based firm run by an American expatriate, won
the initial round, selling the Angels 100,000 pairs of inflatable red
batons they'll give to fans at the first two games of the World
Series, starting Saturday at Edison Field in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Banging two 26-inch tubes together has become the signature
rallying call for Angel fans eager to create a deafening din to
distract opponents. The tubes also serve as handy advertising tools
for corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   But rival banger maker Vonco Products of Lake Villa, Ill., is
still in the game. The Giants ordered its ThunderStix Noisemakers
brand batons for one of the three home games it expects to play
during the series, said Valerie McGuire, a team official.</TE>
<TE>   And Vonco may have scored a marketing win from all the publicity
the noisemakers have garnered in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball announcers refer to the batons as thunder sticks
regardless of the maker. Vonco supplied the Angels with ThunderStix
for several games during the two rounds of playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be competing head to head for the World Series and the
playoffs, but demand overall for the product is building for both
companies," said Les Leske, a Vonco vice president.</TE>
<TE>   The family-owned business, which also makes plastic goods such as
medical specimen bags, has created a ThunderStix.com Web site and
plans to protect its trademark, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The companies argue over which is the market leader. CheerStix
says it has 80% of the market. Leske says it's evenly split. No one
keeps independent statistics for what by most estimates is an
industry with $2 million in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   The inflatable batons first appeared about 10 seasons ago at a
baseball game in South Korea, said Jim Lundberg, who owns CheerStix.</TE>
<TE>   Lundberg thought the noisemakers, also called bangers, would work
in the U.S. and that he could produce them for less than the Korean
supplier. His first big order came in 1997 when he supplied 25,000
pairs for an international soccer match in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "Next stop was basketball, the NBA playoffs in 1998," Lundberg
said. "I called up the [Seattle Super-] Sonics and offered them 1,000
for free." He got an order the next day for 15,000 sets. "The Sonics
told the [Portland Trail] Blazers, the Blazers told the [Charlotte]
Hornets, the Hornets told the [Phoenix] Suns, the Suns told the
[Indiana] Pacers, the Pacers told the [Los Angeles] Lakers. Eight of
the 16 teams used it."</TE>
<TE>   The batons also are popular at women's soccer games and at college
football games.</TE>
<TE>   But the noise can be so distracting that the Pacific 10 Conference
decided last week to ban the bangers from its football games next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Like a baseball manager plotting his next pitching move, Lundberg
won the Angels World Series sale with crafty strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Angels beat the Yankees, I knew that they had to be out
of sticks and that ThunderStix probably wouldn't be able to turn a
new order around quick enough for the American League Championship
series against the [Minnesota] Twins," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I left messages for the Angels management Monday morning and by
Monday evening I had the order," Lundberg said in a telephone
interview from Beijing, where he operates his banger factory.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of CheerStix sells for as little as 30 cents, including air
freight, Lundberg said. He plans to fly from Beijing to personally
deliver 100 boxes -- 1,000 pairs to each box -- to the team Friday.</TE>
<TE>   ThunderStix, which are made in Illinois, sell for about 40 cents a
set for lots of 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   "As an American company working with American sponsors for the
American national pastime, we like to think that the teams would want
to order from a domestic company rather than sending the business to
China," Leske said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels first used the bangers for a home game in July. The
team looked at giving red rally towels to each fan but balked at the
price.</TE>
<TE>   The team settled on the batons as a less costly alternative, said
Robert Alvarado, the Angels' director of marketing. And the banger
craze was launched.</TE>
<TE>   The sporting teams rarely pay for the noisemakers, instead passing
on the cost to an advertising sponsor, whose name appears on the side
of the batons. The tab for a one-day supply for a full stadium runs
from $16,000 to $20,000, Alvarado said.</TE>
<TE>   For the World Series, though, the bangers almost went silent.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarado said the series is controlled by major league baseball,
which months ago lined up Nextel Communications Inc. to sponsor a
rally towel giveaway, regardless of who was playing.</TE>
<TE>   "We got on the phone with major league baseball Monday morning and
asked for some help because we didn't want to go without the sticks,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball worked out a deal to put Nextel's name on the batons as
well as the towels, Alvarado said. PepsiCo Inc. will sponsor the
noisemakers for Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to have the batons at each home game but haven't
said who will fill the order if there is a Game 6 or a Game 7 in the
best-of-seven series. Each maker says it's negotiating for the order.</TE>

<HD>Waksal Pleads Guilty to Six Charges</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say the ImClone founder remains uncooperative
in their widening probe, which includes Martha Stewart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- ImClone Systems Inc. founder Samuel D. Waksal pleaded
guilty Tuesday to insider trading, bank fraud and other crimes, but
prosecutors said he still isn't cooperating in their widening probe
of questionable stock transactions.</LD>
<LD>   The government's prime target appears to be home-and-hearth tycoon
Martha Stewart, a close Waksal friend whose own timely sale of
ImClone shares has drawn investigators' scrutiny, said Houston lawyer
Christopher Bebel, a former federal prosecutor who has watched the
case closely.</LD>
<LD>   "The prosecutors believe Dr. Waksal has information which will
directly or indirectly target Martha Stewart, and as a result, the
government is trying to coerce Dr. Waksal into cooperating," Bebel
said.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers for Stewart, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc., issued this statement Tuesday through a
public-relations firm: "Sam Waksal's guilty plea has nothing to do
with Martha Stewart." Beyond that, Stewart and her representatives
offered no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, 55, an immunologist, entrepreneur and former A-list New
York socialite, pleaded guilty Tuesday to six of the 13 felony counts
lodged against him in a federal complaint in June. Together, the six
charges carry a maximum prison term of 65 years, including 30 years
for the bank-fraud charge.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a difficult time and a sad time," Waksal said in a
brief statement outside the Lower Manhattan courthouse after entering
his plea. "I've made some terrible mistakes, and I deeply regret what
has happened. I was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   During the hourlong hearing before U.S. District Judge William H.
Pauley III, Waksal detailed the chain of lies, fraud and cover-up
that surrounded his desperate attempt to dump ImClone shares in
December ahead of a devastating Food and Drug Administration ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Somber in a dark-gray suit, white shirt and blue tie, Waksal
testified that he learned Dec. 26 that the FDA would turn down the
application of Erbitux, ImClone's most prominent cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the company's share-price would plunge on the bad news,
Waksal said he phoned his daughter Aliza that day and insisted that
she sell her 39,472 shares of stock, then worth $2.5 million. He said
he did not tell her about the adverse FDA ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal said the next day, he arranged to get 79,797 of his own
shares transferred to his daughter's brokerage account at Merrill
Lynch and attempted to sell them. Merrill blocked the transaction,
however, because the shares were restricted and not available for
sale.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal also recounted how, after the Securities and Exchange
Commission launched an investigation of the sales this year, he
suggested that his daughter lie to agency investigators about his
phone call. He said he also lied in his own testimony in April.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the bank-fraud count, Waksal admitted intercepting a
letter that Bank of America had sent to ImClone's chief counsel in
2000 asking for verification that Waksal still owned securities he
had pledged in 1999 as collateral on a line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal said he forged the counsel's name on a return letter
verifying the ownership, so that the credit line would be extended.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also revealed Tuesday that they are examining the
previously undisclosed sales of $600,000 worth of ImClone stock by a
"close friend" of Waksal on Dec. 28, plus the sale of $30 million
worth of shares in a series of transactions Dec. 27 and 28 that
followed "phone conversations between Dr. Waksal and [a] tippee."</TE>
<TE>   The implication is that prosecutors would charge Waksal with
orchestrating those stock sales, which, because of the high dollar
amount, could lead to a much stiffer prison sentence than the one he
already faces because of his guilty plea, Bebel, the former
prosecutor, said.</TE>

<HD>Authorities Pursue 'Specific' Suspects in Bali Terror Blast</HD>
<DH>Indonesian police search on four islands for seven people,
including two allegedly linked to Al Qaeda, intelligence sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KUTA, Indonesia -- Authorities searched Tuesday for seven suspects in
a deadly bombing in Bali, including two Arabs allegedly connected to
Al Qaeda, intelligence sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Indonesian police were searching on Bali and three other islands
for the suspects, who are believed to have fled after the Saturday
night attack that killed at least 188 people, most of them young
foreign tourists.</LD>
<LD>   Police officials could not be reached to confirm the report, but
one source said Indonesian authorities had informed U.S. and
Australian intelligence agents here of the search for the suspects.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. intelligence officials said they had no
information on suspects in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia had already suffered a string of terrorist bombings that
have claimed dozens of lives over the last two years. Before
Saturday's blast devastated a popular tourist district in Bali,
however, the national government had not made a commitment to
aggressively pursue terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   After long denying that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network was
active in Indonesia, the government blamed the bombing on foreign
operatives from the group, working with Indonesians. It is unclear
what evidence the government has of the terrorist network's
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "This attack has been well planned, and it required expertise in
handling high-tech" bombs, Indonesian intelligence chief A.M.
Hendropriyono told reporters. "It is a very complicated task and is
outside the ability of local hands."</TE>
<TE>   The police search was focused on the islands of Java, Sulawesi and
Lombok, as well as Bali, said one of the intelligence sources, who
added: "They are after specific people."</TE>
<TE>   Police say they found traces of C4 plastic explosives at the site,
which may have been used to help detonate a homemade explosive, such
as ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with diesel fuel. The bomb was
in a van and set off by remote control, possibly with a cellular
phone or radio transmitter, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the Mitsubishi van used in the bombing were recovered,
including the engine block and the chassis. However, all identifying
numbers had been removed before the bombing, making it difficult to
trace the vehicle's ownership, a police investigator said. The van
earlier had been identified as a Toyota Kijang.</TE>
<TE>   Police are holding two people as part of the investigation. "There
are two witnesses who we are questioning because they are a bit
suspicious," said Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, the Indonesian national
police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Police also questioned 10 Pakistanis living on Bali who had been
involved in religious activities.</TE>
<TE>   In the northern Sulawesi island city of Manado, police arrested
two suspects for their alleged involvement in a bombing that occurred
there the same evening as the Bali blast. A small bomb exploded
outside the Philippine Consulate in the city and blew down a gate but
caused no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the blast may be linked to the car bomb
in Bali and another small explosion that occurred about 100 yards
from the U.S. Honorary Consulate in Bali the same evening, causing no
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development Tuesday, the radical Islamic group
Laskar Jihad, whose members fought Christians on the Molucca Islands
in eastern Indonesia, announced that it would disband.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the fighters began surrendering their weapons and
withdrawing from the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Some intelligence analysts see the recent blasts as a sign of the
growing reach of organized terrorists in Southeast Asia. They believe
that the Bali bombing was carried out by Al Qaeda in cooperation with
Jemaah Islamiah, a regional terrorist organization that allegedly
plotted last year to blow up seven targets in Singapore with truck
bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In Australia, Prime Minister John Howard said he would seek to
have Jemaah Islamiah listed by the United Nations as a terrorist
organization. British Prime Minister Tony Blair also said he would
like to add the group to his nation's list of proscribed extremist
groups, though he acknowledged that there was as yet no firm evidence
to link the organization to the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in the Philippines said Tuesday that they had issued
warrants for four suspected Jemaah Islamiah members -- two Filipinos
and two foreigners -- who allegedly took part in a series of deadly
bombings in Manila in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they are part of the group," said police Gen. Roberto
Delfin, head of the Philippine National Police Intelligence
Directorate. "We believe they are still planning" more terrorist
acts.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Jemaah Islamiah in Singapore and Malaysia have
identified Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir as the
organization's leader. He has repeatedly denied involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Bali bombing, Indonesian police interviewed Bashir but
refused to take action against him, saying there was no evidence that
he was in charge of Jemaah Islamiah. Police are expected to interview
him again this week.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Bashir accused Western
intelligence agencies of staging the Bali bombing to make it appear
that terrorists were operating in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure it was masterminded by foreign intelligence agencies
that are Jewish and American," Bashir said. "It was done to justify
the image that America wants to create that Indonesia is a terrorist
hotbed."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph Boyce called Bashir's remarks
"outrageous and reprehensible."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Hindus, Muslims and Christians attended a sunset
ceremony Tuesday near the Bali bombing site to light candles and pray
for the victims. Many brought flowers, incense and offerings of food.</TE>
<TE>   Among those joining in the ceremony was Ibu Agus Pramono, 46, a
Muslim who lost a friend in the explosion. "I have no idea who did
it, but I really hope they are arrested and brought to justice
quickly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Janet Stobart in London contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Arabs Won't Join a War on Iraq, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Head of a key grouping in the region warns of depth of
feeling there against America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said in remarks published
Tuesday that Arab states would not take part in any U.S.-led attack
on Iraq and warned that it is dangerous to underestimate anti-U.S.
sentiments in the region.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush accuses Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein of developing
weapons of mass destruction and is seeking a tough U.N. resolution on
arms inspections authorizing a military strike against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Washington is also trying to build an international coalition,
including Arab states, to support a possible strike.</LD>
<TE>   "As for using the military option or any force against Iraq, what
is certain is that no one in the Arab world accepts or sanctions such
a move," Moussa told the United Arab Emirates' Arabic-language Al
Khaleej newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Arab states cannot be part of or join an alliance directed
against an Arab nation without justification. And if, as some
suggest, the justification is weapons of mass destruction, then the
logical solution lies in the return of inspectors to Iraq to see for
themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad denies it has nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and
has agreed to readmit U.N. arms inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Moussa said any attack on Iraq would fuel strong anti-U.S. feeling
in the Arab world over what is seen as Washington's blind support for
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Military action will certainly be a precursor to events that may
be dangerous in the region, particularly in light of the extreme and
unprecedented Arab anger, which has been underestimated ... and it
should not be underestimated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Gulf Arab states that have defense pacts with the United
States would allow Washington to use their bases to attack Iraq,
Moussa said, "I don't think that any military agreement with the
United States contains articles on helping to attack Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, a key regional U.S. ally and a launch pad for the
1991 Persian Gulf War to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait, said Monday
it opposed war on Iraq and would not participate in any strike on its
neighbor.</TE>

<HD>Aircraft Carrier Crew Ready for Any Coming Iraq Mission</HD>
<DH>Anticipation is rising on the Lincoln, currently supporting
coalition forces in Afghanistan but not far from Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD THE USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, in the northern Arabian Sea -- Navy
Cmdr. Rick Simon, leader of a squadron of electronic warfare planes,
was talking about the possibility of President Bush ordering an
airstrike on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "If it kicks off, it's going to be very aggressive, very sudden
and very lethal," said Simon, 44, whose EA-6B Prowlers from Whidbey
Island, Wash., could jam Iraq's air defenses and communication
systems.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a saying: 'Go big or stay home,' " he said this week. "If
we do it, it's going to be overpowering."</LD>
<TE>   While the Lincoln's current mission is to support coalition forces
in Afghanistan by carrying out surveillance flights and staying
prepared to bomb Al Qaeda and Taliban forces, much of the talk among
the aircraft carrier's 5,500 crew members is about Iraq and the
possibility of a preemptive strike to topple President Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The ship's warplanes won't "go in there to tie," said Cmdr. Jeff
Penfield, 42, of Lemoore, Calif., commander of a squadron of F/A-18
Super Hornet attack planes. "The way you win is with a full-frontal
assault, using overwhelming power to dominate the enemy and break his
will to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Of the Navy's 12 carriers, the Lincoln is the closest to Iraq. So
its 70-plus warplanes are the logical candidates to take a leading
role in any airstrikes against Hussein's regime. Based in Everett,
Wash., the Lincoln arrived in the Persian Gulf region Sept. 11, a
year to the day after the terrorist attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation is rising aboard ship about the possibility of
airstrikes, among both veterans who were part of Operation Desert
Storm in 1991 and a decade of enforcing "no-fly" zones over Iraq, and
young crew members on their first deployments.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be part of it," said Jaclyn Dwyer, 21, of Brentwood,
who works the flight deck. "I was in boot camp on 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   "The man's got to go," Petty Officer 2nd Class Jovaughn Frierson,
27, of Philadelphia, said of Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   When not flying Afghanistan missions, flight crews practice
bombing runs over open ocean. The looming possibility of war with
Iraq has not changed that training, officials said. Bombing is
bombing, and the basics remain the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Blocking and tackling basics are the things that spell success in
combat," said Capt. Scott Swift, 44, deputy commander of the
carrier's air wing, using a football analogy. "We're always doing
that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, talk of Iraq has put extra snap into the orders of senior
enlisted sailors to the hundreds of airplane handlers and mechanics,
many of whom are only a few years out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   "We're telling our gang: Our back-ends better be up, they better
be sweet," said Master Chief John Sais, 43, a 25-year veteran who
supervises crew members working on the E-2C Hawkeyes, a command and
control aircraft that carries much of its electronic equipment in the
rear of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Unfinished Business</TE>
<TE>   Sais has been on several deployments to enforce the "no-fly" rules
imposed on Iraq after a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait from
Baghdad's troops in 1991. For Sais and others, Hussein represents a
kind of unfinished business: The missions to enforce the "no-fly"
restrictions have not kept him from brutalizing his own people.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always the same," said Sais, whose Hawkeye squadron is based
at Point Mugu. "We go in there, we work hard, and we do the
mission.... It's sometimes frustrating for us."</TE>
<TE>   For aviators, the Afghanistan missions have become somewhat
routine. The Lincoln arrived after the bombing had ended. Iraq, by
comparison, will be anything but routine, a fact that adds to the
impatience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mood of 'if we're going to do it, let's do it fast,' "
said Lt. Michael Orr, a Prowler pilot. "Once a decision is made, I
hope it comes quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Familiar Territory</TE>
<TE>   Penfield's Super Hornet pilots have discussed what missions they
might fly. Prowler crew members have talked about what targets will
need to be "neutralized" with jamming.</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi leader finds himself unable to broadcast messages to
the Iraqi people during the attack, it will probably be because
Simon's planes have blacked out Iraq's television sets. A dozen years
of flying over Iraq has taught the Navy a good deal about where
Hussein's communication systems are located.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lincoln crew has had little official word about the
status of the standoff between Hussein and Bush, shipboard TVs
provide a virtual minute-by-minute update. "Everybody is watching CNN
on their off-time," said Troy Richey, 42, the top enlisted man in the
Prowler squadron.</TE>
<TE>   But even with constant news coverage, there is still an aura of
unreality.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd be here when this happened," said deck sailor
Nathan Sotello, 19, of Midland, Texas. "But I'm here and I'm ready to
take him [Hussein] down."</TE>

<HD>World Hunger on the Rise Again</HD>
<DH>More crises and fewer donations from wealthy nations have
combined to erase gains made in the 1990s, the United Nations
reports.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- Every year, about 6 million children under the age
of 5 die as a result of hunger and malnutrition, says a U.N. study
released Tuesday. That's as if all of California's children in that
age group -- more than twice over -- starved to death.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 report on world hunger by the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization says progress in slowing starvation has
ground to a halt in many parts of the world. Military conflicts,
droughts, floods and poverty, combined with a shortfall in donations
from wealthy nations, all contribute to the increase in hunger.</LD>
<LD>   Another U.N. agency that supplies emergency food aid, the World
Food Program, reported last week that it is struggling because of a
sudden increase in crises and a lack of contributions. The WFP has
been forced to halt grain rations to North Korea and will only be
able to meet 60% of needs in Afghanistan this year. A spokeswoman
said the agency is unprepared for any new disasters -- such as a
major rebuilding effort after a war in Iraq, which is already
dependent on U.N. food aid.</LD>
<TE>   "WFP is sounding the alarm. Never has our organization been
confronted with such a great number of crises in the world with
insufficient contributions from donor states to face them," said
Christiane Berthiaume, the spokeswoman. "Other crises could come
along. Iraq is a huge unknown."</TE>
<TE>   While the WFP deals with food emergencies, the Food and
Agriculture Organization tries to prevent them by creating programs
for sustainable development. But disasters, both human-made and
natural, have worked against their efforts in recent years. About 30
countries are facing exceptional crises, the FAO reports. The agency
is appealing for an increase in contributions to its anti-hunger
program, which stands at $24 billion a year, to meet the U.N. goal of
halving world hunger by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is not whether we can afford to invest the
resources, the energy and political commitment required to fight
hunger," wrote FAO Director General Jacques Diouf in the report.
"Rather we must ask whether we can afford not to do so. The answer is
we cannot."</TE>
<TE>   The FAO's latest estimate from 1998 to 2000 put the number of
undernourished people at 840 million -- roughly 15% of the world's
people. After some progress in the 1990s, the rate has returned to
levels of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   About 799 million of those suffering from undernourishment live in
developing countries. In the worst-affected nations, a newborn child
can only expect to live until 38, compared with an average life
expectancy of 70 years in the wealthiest countries.</TE>
<TE>   Malnourishment makes children more susceptible to common illnesses
that can quickly become killers. The four biggest causes of death
among hungry children in developing countries are diarrhea, acute
respiratory illness, malaria and measles, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   While there have been some gains, most of them come from strong
improvement in a handful of countries. In China, for instance, the
number of people suffering from undernourishment declined by 74
million, said Charles Riemenschneider, the FAO's director for North
America.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the developing world, unfortunately, has seen an
increase in the number of hungry people by about 50 million" since
world leaders pledged at the World Food Summit six years ago to cut
hunger in half by 2015, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have both the greatest number of
undernourished people and the largest increase in malnourishment, the
report says. Most of the increase took place in Central Africa,
mainly in war-torn Congo, where the number of undernourished people
has tripled.</TE>
<TE>   To more effectively reduce hunger, the FAO has outlined a program
that would require a public investment of $24 billion a year,
splitting the cost between industrialized and developing countries.
The agency recommends combining sustainable development programs in
rural areas with ways to improve access to food. FAO officials urged
donors to think of contributions not as charity but as a long-term
investment with a real payoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Cutting the number of hungry people by half is not only a moral
obligation, it is a good investment that will have solid economic
returns for both the poor and rich," Riemenschneider said.</TE>
<TE>   FAO estimates show that the global economic benefits of reducing
hunger by half would amount to $120 billion a year as people have
longer and more productive lives.</TE>

<HD>Vote Belies Ethnic Split in Iraqi City</HD>
<DH>Despite show of support for Hussein, Kurds in oil-rich
Kirkuk pose a threat to the regime and regional stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KIRKUK, Iraq -- This ethnically diverse city seated atop one of the
world's major oil reserves delivered an effusive show of support for
President Saddam Hussein during Tuesday's referendum, with silk
flowers, children in their best dress and cheers for the 23-year
Iraqi regime.</LD>
<LD>   But the display of unity by the city's Kurd, Arab and Turkmen
voters belied the serious ethnic fault lines in Kirkuk that could
threaten regional stability and put the U.S. in conflict with an
important ally in the event of an American invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Hussein has maintained control of Kirkuk with a strong military
presence and forced "Arabization" of the city that many Kurds covet
as the capital of an independent Kurdistan.</LD>
<TE>   The prospect of a Kurdish state is a nightmare not only for
Hussein, but for neighboring Turkey, a key U.S. ally in the region
that has been struggling to control its own Kurdish population.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein, who has long argued that he is the only one who can keep
the Kurdish independence movement from spiraling out of control,
received nothing but praise from the residents heading for the polls
on the day their president asked them to reaffirm his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Our life is good, we don't face any difficulties," Efran Ali, 27,
said in Kurdish through a government-appointed translator. He said he
preferred to speak in Kurdish because his Arabic is "broken."</TE>
<TE>   Ali was one of the more than 11.5 million Iraqis who went to the
polls in what was a national day of leader worship.</TE>
<TE>   Voting is probably the wrong word to describe what happened in
Iraq, because citizens had no real choice -- literally or
figuratively. Though the ballots were technically secret, people in
many places proudly displayed their "yes" vote as they stuffed it
into the ballot box. Results were expected to be released early
today, but all that was in question was the size of Hussein's
victory. In the last referendum, held in 1995, he received 99.96% of
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's balloting here in Kirkuk, Ali and his friends
stood up the block, a good distance away from the pro-Hussein party.
But it is nearly impossible to talk to anyone in Iraq in private, as
the government requires that all journalists travel with an appointed
minder. So it is the government's man translating the words of Ali
and his Kurdish friends.</TE>
<TE>   "This city is a mixture of everyone, Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen,
Christians," said 17-year-old Mohammed Nazam. "There is no difference
between us. We all live together."</TE>
<TE>   But behind such cheery sentiments lies a more complex reality, one
that government officials, diplomats based here and analysts
acknowledge could be one of the biggest problems facing America
should it pursue its agenda to overthrow the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has a claim to Kirkuk," said Judith Yaphe, senior
researcher at the National Defense University in Washington. "It's a
flash point."</TE>
<TE>   After the U.S.-led coalition vanquished Iraqi forces from Kuwait
in 1991, Kurds in the north rebelled against Baghdad, succeeding
briefly in taking control of this crucial city. Hussein sent in his
elite Republican Guard, which easily pushed the rebels back.</TE>
<TE>   Though the United States did nothing militarily to aid the Kurds
in the north, or the Shiite Muslims in the south, in their efforts to
oust the regime, the U.S. at the time set up zones that kept Iraqi
forces out of both regions.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, U.S. and British warplanes patrol "no-fly" zones in
the north and the south. For the Kurds, that has meant more than a
decade of unprecedented autonomy from Baghdad. They have their own
government and are considering a national constitution.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't have Kirkuk. Hussein does.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his grip on the city, the Iraqi leader has a heavy
military presence in the region. But he also pursued Arabization, a
policy of forced migration. The goal is to tip the demographic
balance in the city away from the Kurds. An estimated 250,000 Kurds
reportedly have been forced out of Kirkuk since the end of the
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Baghdad issued a presidential decree giving non-Arabs
the chance to "correct" their nationality and embrace their "Arab
roots." If they refused, they could be forced to relocate to Iraqi
Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the north, home to about 3.6 million Kurds, there are two main
political groups, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan. They recently have moved toward uniting, and
although they are very cautious not to call for an independent state,
they have said they support an autonomous Kurdish region within a
post-Hussein Iraq. And they want Kirkuk, center of a region that
holds one-third of Iraq's oil wealth, for their capital.</TE>
<TE>   That angers Turkey, Iraq's neighbor to the north and the site of a
military base used by the U.S. Air Force in enforcing the northern
"no-fly" zone.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's Kurdish population, a minority in the south of the
country, has been fighting for independence. The Turks do not want to
see Iraqi Kurds on their border empowered and enriched, and they are
prepared to take military action to prevent that from occurring.
European diplomats based in Baghdad said this is one of the gravest
concerns held by regional American allies concerning a potential U.S.
strike against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey may feel the urge to deploy a significant military
presence in northern Iraq" before any U.S. strike, wrote Sedat Ergin,
a columnist for the Turkish daily Hurriyet on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ergin, the Turks are determined to head off a Kurdish
takeover of Kirkuk. "This scenario means a direct Turkish-Kurdish
war," he wrote. "It also means Turkey becoming Baghdad's ally."</TE>
<TE>   But none of this was in evidence Tuesday, as the government led a
tour of Kirkuk polling places to demonstrate the city's support for
the president. The referendum, which is scheduled to be held every
seven years, conveniently came at a time when the country is facing a
possible military invasion. So it served as an opportunity for the
government to highlight its citizens' loyalty. And its citizens took
advantage of that -- at least while the government officials were
around.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who wants to invade, please tell them to bring their
coffins," said Ehsan Taher Korshid, 54.</TE>

<HD>Oil Counts in Iraq War Equation</HD>
<DH>Regime change might mean a rise in output. For Russia, that

<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The prospect of military action against Saddam Hussein
has touched off an international contest for Iraq's vast oil reserves
and has complicated U.S. efforts to cultivate Russia as a major
future source of oil.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow is seeking assurances from Washington that if Hussein is
ousted, Western companies won't take away the lucrative oil-field
development rights that Russian oil firms negotiated with the Iraqi
president's government. Iraq's reserves are second in size only to
Saudi Arabia's.</LD>
<LD>   Industry experts and insiders say the issue has become a potential
sticking point in negotiations between the Bush and Putin
administrations over Washington's efforts to obtain United Nations
backing for its Iraq policy.</LD>
<TE>   "Russian companies are worried the new regime may discard
previously signed agreements and favor the U.S. oil industry," said
Fred Mutalibov, an oil-field services analyst for SWS Securities in
Dallas. "To get Russia's support, or at least their silent agreement,
the United States has to assure that Russian oil interests will be
considered once the regime change has occurred."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high, particularly for Russia. Not only does its
fledgling private-sector oil industry stand to lose future
development windfalls, but its export-driven economy also would
suffer if a new, pro-Western regime in Iraq pumped up current
production and flooded world markets with crude. Although Iraq is a
member of OPEC, there is no assurance that a new government would
abide by the cartel's production restraints.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to need to massively rebuild," said John Kingston,
global oil research director at Platts, an energy information
service. "They're going to need lots and lots of money, and there's
only one way to get it. They only have one cash crop, so they're
going to want to produce as much as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict that oil prices would fall from about $30 a
barrel today to about $20 as Iraqi production gradually increased
from about 1.5 million barrels a day to about 3 million barrels over
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which depends on oil for about 40% of its export revenue,
would be hard hit by a price decline. In addition, Iraqi crude would
be competing for the same European markets where Russia sells most of
its oil.</TE>
<TE>   "The big blow will be for the Russian economy and the oil industry
in general," said Nelli Sharushkina, who tracks the industry from
Moscow for Energy Information Group. "The lower the prices are, the
worse it is for the Russian economy."</TE>
<TE>   For the Bush administration, the issue presents complex political
and economic ramifications. America's economy would benefit from
lower oil prices, and U.S. oil firms might prosper if Iraq reneged on
its deal with the Russians. But a brazenly U.S.-centric policy would
not only damage relations with Russia, it could also undermine the
legitimacy of a new Iraqi regime.</TE>
<TE>   "If the legacy of this war is the appearance that the United
States is sacrificing Iraq's interests to suit American interests,
all it will do is ensure that any government the United States sets
up will be seen as a puppet government and will be torn down," said
Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   For the international oil industry, a regime change in Baghdad
could put one of the world's most restricted petroleum markets into
play.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq sits atop 11% of the world's proven oil reserves, about 112
billion barrels. At $30 a barrel, that's $145,000 worth of crude for
every man, woman and child in the country. And Iraqi petroleum
geologists believe there's at least twice that much in additional
reserves still to be confirmed. (By comparison, the United States has
22 billion barrels, or about $2,300 per person.)</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's giant Kirkuk field was discovered in 1927, and U.S. oil
companies played a big role in Iraqi oil development before the
entire industry was nationalized in the 1970s. But eight years of war
with Iran in the 1980s and 12 years of U.N. sanctions following
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait have destroyed much of Iraq's oil
production infrastructure and restricted development of new fields to
replace dwindling production from old ones.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials have acknowledged that they lack the financial and
technological resources to rebuild their oil industry. They estimate
that as much as $50 billion of foreign investment would be needed to
reach their production target of 6 million barrels a day over the
next decade.</TE>
<TE>   "They're broke," said Matthew Simmons, who heads a petroleum
industry investment banking firm in Houston. "They need money. They
need help. They need technical assistance, and it becomes
particularly urgent if in fact they really have destroyed the
backbone of their existing fields."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Hussein's government struck a 23-year,
$3.5-billion deal with a consortium headed by Lukoil, Russia's
largest oil company, to rehabilitate Iraqi oil fields. But the U.N.
sanctions have prevented the work from proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad has entered into smaller development deals with companies
in Russia, China and France, in part to undermine political support
for U.S. policy toward Iraq. All three countries have veto power on
the United Nations Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Some form of accommodation appears likely. "We are in conversation
with our Russian friends about their interests, and we are taking
into account their consideration," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
told the U.S.-Russian Business Council this month. Commerce Secretary
Donald Evans said the issue came up in private talks with industry
officials at a U.S.-Russia energy conference in Houston last week.
Lukoil President Vagit Alekperov said Russian officials had assured
him that his company would not lose its big contract in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect before the Bush administration gets its vote in the
U.N., it's going to have to have something in writing with the
Russians," said Newport Beach energy consultant Philip Verleger, a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Many industry
experts and foreign policy specialists argue that helping Russia hang
on to its Iraqi interests would be the smart thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration should be thinking of a strategy to jump-start
the Iraqi economy," said Washington attorney Mark Brzezinski, a
former National Security Council staff member. "Russian energy
companies have experience working in Iraq, and their knowledge of how
to get things done could contribute toward the larger objective of
getting the economy off the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that Russia has a role in future oil development in Iraq
would also advance the administration's efforts to promote more
collaboration between U.S. and Russian oil companies and find new
sources of oil outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Although the lack of big supertanker ports prevents Russia
from shipping much crude to the United States, Russian officials say
planned improvements would allow them to satisfy as much as 10% of
America's oil appetite in future years.</TE>
<TE>   One small sign of growing goodwill: For the first time, several
hundred thousand barrels of Russian crude will be pumped into the
U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that's happened since Sept. 11, 2001, makes it not
just more likely, but more real that there will be increasing
cooperation between the United States and Russia," said Joseph A.
Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "Iraq
just adds to that. It adds to the imperative."</TE>
<TE>   Yet no matter what assurances the U.S. makes, there might be
limits to how much it can deliver. The rehabilitation and development
of Iraq's oil fields would take years and multiple contracts to
complete. The U.S. would hold sway over a new government in Baghdad.
But it would not want to alienate the Iraqi public by dictating oil
policy, and its influence would inevitably wane.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the 1800s. We're not talking about a colony. We're
talking about an independent country," said Amy Jaffe, senior energy
analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, site
of last week's conference. President Bush "is not going to be
president of Iraq."</TE>

<HD>Ivory Coast Loyalist Troops Retake City From Rebels</HD>
<DH>Army works to eliminate insurgents from Daloa, which had
fallen over the weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOUAFLE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>The government said loyalist troops were working Tuesday to wipe out
remaining resistance after retaking Daloa, a major city in this
country's cocoa belt.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Jules Yao Yao, an army spokesman, urged residents of Daloa to
report any suspected insurgents to the military. The rebels' capture
of the city over the weekend had been a blow to the government and
rattled cocoa markets abroad.</LD>
<LD>   "The counteroffensive against Daloa has ended with success," Yao
Yao declared on state television. "Our positions are being
consolidated as we seek and destroy all pockets of resistance."</LD>
<TE>   Residents in Daloa, a city of 160,000 in the southwest, said the
rebels apparently had departed, leaving vehicles -- and at least four
bodies -- behind.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said heavy machine-gun fire and explosions shook the
city for about two hours during the afternoon and seemed to be coming
from the road leading north to Vavoua, 35 miles away. By nightfall,
Daloa was quiet again.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels tried to launch a counterattack but failed, said one
resident, reached by phone.</TE>
<TE>   Yao Yao said five rebels were killed and four government soldiers
were injured. The figures could not be independently verified.</TE>
<TE>   The colonel said rebels also tried to break through government
lines east of Bouake, Ivory Coast's second-largest city. Bouake has
been in rebel hands since the uprising began Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   He said government forces killed five rebels and seized documents,
rocket launchers and other weapons in repelling an attack on
Mbahiakro, a city 60 miles east of Bouake.</TE>
<TE>   West African mediators were awaiting word from the insurgents on
whether they were ready to sign a truce. The rebels have seized much
of the northern half of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The insurgency centers on about 800 ex-soldiers, many of them
dismissed from the army for suspected disloyalty. Their uprising has
gathered support from Ivorians in the north, who complain that the
government treats them poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds have died in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The war has prompted tens of thousands of people to flee, creating
a tide of refugees that aid workers fear could spill over Ivorian
borders, destabilizing other West African countries.</TE>

<HD>Not All Israelis Welcome Prospect of War With Iraq</HD>
<DH>Some question whether the status quo isn't better than a
battle that could further inflame sentiments against them in the Arab
world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- As Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon consults with
President Bush in Washington today on Middle East violence and Iraq,
a muted debate is underway here over whether a U.S.-led war against
Israel's archenemy Saddam Hussein is, in fact, a good idea.</LD>
<LD>   While it is widely assumed that Israelis are gloating over the
prospect of Hussein getting his comeuppance after the Persian Gulf
War, when 39 Iraqi Scud missiles rained down on Israel, the reality
is far more complex and the reactions more ambivalent.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt Israelis more than almost anyone would prefer a Middle
East without Hussein, but some question whether the status quo of a
weakened and contained Iraq isn't better than a war that could
further inflame anti-Israel sentiments in the Arab world.</LD>
<TE>   And in recent weeks, some Israelis in the military and security
establishment have cautiously questioned whether Hussein poses as
immediate a threat as Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have
warned.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein, a weakling as he is today, is in Israel's
interests," said Aharon Levran, a brigadier general in Israel's
reserve army and author of a book about the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
Levran, one of the more outspoken Israeli critics of Bush's policy on
Iraq, says Baghdad is no longer capable of anything more than a
border skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   "A war against Iraq will divert the United States from its
clear-cut campaign against Islamic fanaticism," Levran said. "And if
it fails, we in Israel will pay the price."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leader Yossi Sarid agreed. "Washington is far away. We
live in the Middle East, and the consequences will be most immediate
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Among hard-liners, there is resentment over the suggestion that
Israel should rein in its campaign against Palestinian violence so as
not to hinder the Bush administration's efforts to win support from
reluctant Arab governments for a campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   During today's meeting, Bush will ask Sharon to show restraint
during this period of diplomatic sensitivity, administration
officials said. In particular, he wants Sharon to stop focusing so
intently on Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, whose
headquarters was put under siege and largely demolished by the
Israeli army last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not make Arafat the issue. Let him depart into the sunset,
as he now seems likely to do," a State Department official said
Tuesday. "Don't try to push him off, which is only rallying more
Palestinians around him."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, in return, is expected to ask that the United States not
use the occasion of an Iraq war to try to impose an
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal for the sake of American diplomatic
expedience.</TE>
<TE>   Another major item on the agenda is the question of whether Israel
would strike back if attacked by Iraq. Sharon has stated publicly
that Israel has every intention of retaliating this time around,
unlike in 1991, when Israel held back in deference to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our focus is how to make the possibility of Israeli
retaliation moot," a Bush administration official said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Sharon's assertion that the U.S. war on terrorism is part
of the same campaign Israel is waging in the Palestinian territories,
the United States has been unusually vocal in its criticism of Israel
lately. Israel was rebuked over last week's incursion into the Gaza
Strip in which 17 Palestinians were killed. The U.S. ambassador to
Israel delivered a sharply worded letter to Sharon on Friday asking
that Israel ease conditions for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the day after the Iraqi campaign is over, we're on a very
short leash," complained an Israeli lobbyist, who asked not to be
quoted by name. "We are weaker, and the Arabs know it."</TE>
<TE>   Given the raucous nature of discourse in Israel, there has been
relatively little public debate about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no noisy rallies either for or against a war.
Sharon has issued a gag order on government officials, prohibiting
them from talking publicly about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, those most enthusiastic about Washington's campaign
dread any suggestion that Israel is egging on the U.S. And those with
misgivings are loath to say anything that might embarrass Israel's
most steadfast ally.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has supported us in our catastrophes," Levran
said, "so we have to support the United States in theirs."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, however, several high-ranking Israeli military
officers have voiced doubts about American and British assessments of
the threat posed by Iraq and in particular how quickly Iraq could
develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difference between our assessment and that stated by
the British," military intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Aharon
Zeevi-Farkash said in a recent interview with Israeli television. But
he added that Israel does agree with assessments about Iraq's
continuing efforts to develop biological and chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon also has said in recent
interviews that Iraq's offensive abilities have been reduced since
the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't lose any sleep over Iraq," Yaalon said at a recent
meeting of the Industry and Commerce club in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Moshe Arens, defense minister during the Gulf War, concurred: "You
might have the same Saddam Hussein on one side, a father and son both
named Bush on the other, but this will not be a deja vu. Israel is in
much better shape than it was in 1991, and Iraq's abilities are very
much diminished."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military specialists have been debating for several years
whether Iraq or Iran poses more of a threat. Most specialists believe
it is Iran, because it is richer and has been more directly
implicated in international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If you told Israeli leaders and analysts two years ago that the
U.S. would be on the verge of attacking Iraq today, they would have
been astonished and confused. The dominant perception across the
political spectrum was that Iraq was not a serious threat," analyst
Barry Rubin wrote in a Jerusalem Post editorial last week headlined:
"U.S. Attack on Iraq: Good for the Jews?"</TE>
<TE>   Rubin cited three reasons why an attack would not be good for
Israel: the danger of Iraq retaliating against Israel, the
possibility of an anti-Israeli backlash in Europe and America if the
war effort goes awry, and the likelihood that the U.S. would pressure
Israel into making concessions to the Palestinians for the sake of
coalition-building.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he believes that most Israelis will be won over by
Bush's arguments. "This is U.S. policy. Everybody will support it,
especially if it is successful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that Israel would be delighted to see the last
of Hussein. The Iraqi leader has been an unwavering archenemy of
Israel's, unleashing fierce rhetoric against the "Zionist entity," as
he calls it, in nearly every speech.</TE>
<TE>   According to Israeli intelligence, Hussein also has been
encouraging Palestinian terrorism by handing out $25,000 rewards to
the families of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the most optimistic of scenarios, Hussein would be removed
from power and a friendly, pro-Western government would take his
place in Iraq. That, some Israelis hope, would make Palestinians more
receptive to Israeli demands and set the stage for more pliant Arab
governments throughout the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say, however, that this is a fanciful scenario and that
what is equally likely is an Arab world that is more committed to the
destruction of Israel than ever. Sarid, the opposition leader, says a
U.S. war against Iraq could destabilize moderate regimes in Egypt,
Jordan and the Gulf states.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of one murderous Saddam, you'll have two or three
murderous Saddams, and we will be their target," Sarid said.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Robin Wright in Washington and Tracy Wilkinson in
Jerusalem contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>5 Japanese Abducted by N. Korea Return Home</HD>
<DH>Kidnapped in 1978 to serve as language teachers, the
victims can only stay for two weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Five Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea returned
home for the first time in 24 years, their lapels sporting the red
badges of the late patriarch Kim Il Sung that are obligatory in the
authoritarian nation.</LD>
<LD>   Young adults when they were snatched from Japanese soil in 1978 to
serve in North Korea's spy-training camps as language teachers, the
returnees are well into middle age. They stepped off the jet,
chartered by the Japanese government to fetch them from Pyongyang,
North Korea's capital, into the embrace of families bearing flowers,
welcome-home banners, Japanese flags and plenty of tears.</LD>
<LD>   Fukie Hamamoto, 47, sobbed as she hugged each of her seven
siblings. "She is the sister she used to be," said her older brother,
Yuko Hamamoto, after spending time with her on a bus to a downtown
Tokyo hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Hidekazu Hasuike, 74, hugged his long-missing son, Kaoru. "I'll
never forget that moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reunions are temporary. North Korea did not allow the
abductees to bring their children, who are mostly in their teens.
Some of their families in Japan have suggested that the children are
hostages, inhibiting the returnees from telling the full truth and
guaranteeing that they will go back to North Korea in about two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging over the reunions was North Korea's announcement last
month that eight other Japanese it admitted kidnapping in the 1970s
and 1980s were dead. North Korea says they died of causes ranging
from suicide and drowning to traffic accidents and carbon-monoxide
poisoning. Many Japanese believe they're still alive and that as many
as five dozen others also may have been abducted.</TE>
<TE>   "For the remainder of my life, I want to work together to rescue
the rest of those abducted," Hidekazu Hasuike said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shigeru Yokota's daughter, who disappeared at age 13, is
among those North Korea says are dead, he introduced the returnees
and their families on a joyous note. "We've been waiting 24 years for
this moment, and they're finally back," Yokota said at a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has said his daughter, Megumi Yokota, who vanished
after a school badminton practice, killed herself a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Yokotas got word Tuesday that DNA tests had confirmed that a
15-year-old girl North Korea said was Megumi's daughter is indeed
probably their granddaughter. The girl had gone to Pyongyang airport
at the same time as the others, hoping that her grandparents would
arrive, Japanese officials said. The Yokotas said the Japanese
government had requested that the teenager be allowed to visit Japan,
but North Korea turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   Also at Pyongyang's tiny airport was U.S. defector Charles Robert
Jenkins, who was seeing off his wife, Hitomi Soga, according to a
Japanese diplomat who traveled to Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five returnees, Soga appeared to be the worst for wear,
looking closer to 60 than the 43 she is. She told Japanese diplomats
recently that she was shopping with her mother when she was thrown
into a sack and taken by boat to North Korea in 1978. Her mother, who
disappeared at the same time from Sado island, has not been heard
from.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to see you," Soga said in Japanese spoken with a
heavy Korean accent.</TE>
<TE>   The abductees spoke only a few sentences at the news conference
and, in a characteristically Japanese gesture, several apologized for
the worry they'd caused. They left the room without taking questions.
Their families, who actively campaigned to get their relatives back,
remained and described their reunions for several more minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The abductees are scheduled to return to Pyongyang just before
talks aimed at establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan
and North Korea. "I'm very happy" about the returns, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said. "But this does not close the abduction
issues."</TE>

<HD>Criminal Inquiry of Ukrainian Leader Ordered</HD>
<DH>Judge's action boosts opposition movement seeking President
Kuchma's ouster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>An appellate court judge in Ukraine on Tuesday ordered a criminal
investigation of President Leonid D. Kuchma, giving an unexpected
boost to an opposition movement that has brought tens of thousands of
protesters into the streets in recent weeks seeking Kuchma's ouster.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Yuri Vasylenko announced at a news conference that he
ordered prosecutors to investigate a variety of charges, including
allegations that Kuchma, 64, was involved in the disappearance of a
Ukrainian journalist and that he sold an advanced radar system to
Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   Kuchma's spokeswoman and a former prosecutor general swiftly
criticized the move, but opposition figures, at the same news
conference as the judge, called for Kuchma to step down.</LD>
<TE>   "The person who is under investigation should not carry on
working. He should step down," said Petro Symonenko, leader of the
Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a criminal case has been launched shows that we
have taken a step toward victory," he added.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Kuchma told reporters that she believed the
constitution would not allow such a step. She gave no further
details.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhailo O. Potebenko, the country's former prosecutor general,
denounced the inquiry as a "populist" measure that would never stand
up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma pledged to fight the appellate judge's decision, Interfax
news service said. He has denied the charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came the day after a team of U.S. and British
investigators arrived to investigate the alleged sale of the Kolchuga
radar system to Iraq, a charge that has already prompted the U.S. to
suspend $54 million in aid to Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The radar allegations stem from secret recordings made by Kuchma's
former bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders say the veteran leader was also involved in the
slaying of reporter Georgi Gongadze, whose headless corpse was found
in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   They also say Kuchma has curbed free speech and normal political
activity in the former Soviet state of 49 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, however, chief prosecutor Svyatoslav Piskun said
he had no grounds for pursuing a criminal case against Kuchma; many
opposition figures believe that the prosecutor's office is too
closely linked to the president to conduct a fair investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma, who has weathered months of protests with little
difficulty, has vowed to remain in power until 2004, when his second
term ends.</TE>

<HD>U.S., France Divided Over U.N. Resolution on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Washington turns up the heat on Paris as a diplomatic chasm
reflects their disparate approaches on how to deal with Baghdad.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The United States and Britain plotted strategy Tuesday
for a new offensive on Iraq -- this time against recalcitrant France,
the key opponent to a single tough U.N. resolution threatening the
use of force unless Iraqi President Saddam Hussein bends to the will
of the world body.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and British Foreign Secretary
Jack Straw huddled in Washington to discuss possible compromises to
break the monthlong impasse that has led to the emergence of France
as the dealmaker, or deal breaker, in determining how the world deals
with Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomatic chasm reflects the disparate approaches to the
problem of Iraq. It also portends tough times for the Bush
administration, and not just on this long-sought resolution.</LD>
<TE>   As it tries to mobilize world support, Washington views its
position in terms of the practical challenges in an era of constant
terrorist threats. U.S. officials rail against the hard realities of
Iraq's past record and future potential. They warn that the dangers
mean dealing not only with Baghdad's alleged weapons of mass
destruction but also with its leadership.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another reflection of Washington's goals, Undersecretary of
State John Bolton on Tuesday called daringly for the
"de-Nazification" of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In stark contrast, the French have been opining about the historic
stakes at play in Iraq, the lofty principles of global collective
security in the post-Cold War world and the fate of the U.N. Charter
in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin called on the United
States this week to "remain faithful to the vision of collective
security that rests on the law." In a speech to the Institute for
National Defense Studies in Paris, he also warned Washington not to
be tempted by the "solitude of power."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, French officials are even talking about the imperiled
"new world order," a term coined by the first Bush administration and
often used to describe the importance of standing up to Hussein after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the French seem to be scoring more points.</TE>
<TE>   France has the backing, in varying degrees, of the larger bloc
among the 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council. A resolution
requires nine votes to pass and no vetoes from the five permanent
members -- the United States, Britain, Russia, China and France.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the French have the backing of seven other
countries, including two other permanent members, to block the U.S.
goal of one resolution that lays out not only what Hussein must do to
comply but the consequences of his failure to act.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the United States has six votes and a wobbly seventh,
according to U.N. diplomatic calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the days of the Cold War, the divide is neither East-West
nor ideological; Russia and China are siding with France.</TE>
<TE>   Powell acknowledged to reporters Tuesday that the diplomatic
maneuvering on a new Iraq resolution is "intense." But he said he was
still "hopeful" that a resolution would eventually win backing.</TE>
<TE>   That may mean major compromises by Washington, however,
particularly because both the U.S. and France want unanimity on the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-0 vote is considered critical to prevent the divisive
consequences of a 1999 resolution. Though that measure passed 11-0,
abstentions by France, Russia, China and Malaysia reflected growing
divisions on strategy toward Iraq that Hussein exploited to
eventually manipulate a three-year reprieve in weapons inspections,
U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is under growing pressure to back down on
four key issues, including the idea that Iraq could automatically
face military action the first time it fails to comply with U.N.
weapons inspectors, according to U.S. and U.N. officials. It's also
being stonewalled by France in outlining a world strategy on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The government of French President Jacques Chirac is intent on
holding out for two separate resolutions. The first would cover the
terms of new weapons inspections to find and destroy any chemical,
biological and nuclear arms and ballistic missiles. It could even
have language warning of consequences, but it would not have an
automatic "trigger" that would in effect authorize the U.S. to use
force at the first sign of a violation, according to U.N. diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just simply a problem of a second resolution, it's about
coming back to the Security Council," Ginette de Matha, spokeswoman
for the French mission to the U.N., said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Security Council must weigh the credibility of any failure
[to comply] and decide what to do about it. It could decide to use
force. It could choose some other action, like issuing a warning, but
the important thing is that it is the council of 15 that decides," De
Matha said.</TE>
<TE>   France is so far balking even at the kind of ambiguous compromise
that calls for a single resolution but two discussions -- a proposal
that would see the Security Council go back for a debate at the first
sign of an Iraqi violation but would also not prevent the U.S. and
Britain from acting if there is not agreement, according to U.S. and
U.N. officials.</TE>
<TE>   For Washington to back down on an understanding about what would
trigger a military response would be a major concession to France,
Russia, China and several other Security Council members that want to
hold Washington in check until the world can decide on what course of
action to take. But key U.N. officials believe that the U.S. and
Britain are headed in that direction.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is also under pressure to give up its proposals
for three of the toughest provisions on disarmament, dubbed by one
U.N. diplomat as "showstoppers." They include demands for armed
escorts for the weapons inspectors, taking Iraqi scientists or
military officers out of the country for interviews and sending in
representatives from the five permanent members of Security Council
with U.N. teams.</TE>
<TE>   These were always ideas deemed part of the "negotiating fat" of
the diplomatic bargaining process, U.S. and U.N. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington is still standing firm against dropping language
that warns Hussein's regime about the danger of serious
"consequences" if he does not fully turn over all weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The French are resisting this point too, however.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, 'serious consequences' is the same as 'material breach.'
'Serious consequences' can be interpreted as possible authorization
for the use of force without returning to the Security Council. We
are against this," De Matha said. "We believe our position -- to have
the Security Council meet [again] to decide the consequences of any
violation -- is the correct position, both in principle and in law."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Bush administration has a strong congressional
resolution, which the president will sign today at a ceremony
designed to send a signal to the United Nations, U.S. officials say
they will be turning up their own heat on France and other key
Security Council members on the intractable central issue.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. officials feel that they are narrowing the
differences, so that a draft resolution could finally be formally
tabled, the French are not quite so certain.</TE>

<HD>Terrorist Bombing Shatters Bali's Economic Hopes</HD>
<DH>The resort island, which depends heavily upon tourism, has
suffered a devastating loss of business in the wake of the attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KUTA, Indonesia -- The road to Bali's tourist heartland ends at the
scarred scene of Saturday's terrorist bombing. There, police tape and
armed guards keep traffic from the site, but they are also a blockade
on the path to economic prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   Few places in the world depend more on tourism than Bali. It
accounts for about 70% of the local economy and employs at least one
in every five people.</LD>
<LD>   "If no tourists come to Bali, then businesses in Bali will die,"
said Made Suarnata, 23, a supervisor at a beachwear store just inside
the police barrier. It is steps from the Sari Club, which was leveled
by a car bomb that killed nearly 200 people and injured hundreds
more.</LD>
<TE>   Few expected that this day of dwindling hope would ever come to
Bali, known as the island of the gods.</TE>
<TE>   The resort has always stood out as an oasis of serenity in a
region racked by economic and political turmoil. It sparkles like a
tiny jewel among a sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands that make
up the world's most populous Muslim nation.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the island's 3 million residents are Hindu, which explains
why they have been spared much of the religious and ethnic strife
that has plagued the rest of Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Economically, Bali has thrived in a country still struggling to
recover from the Asian financial crisis. Vacationers who flock to
this popular holiday destination from around the world sometimes
don't even know that it's part of troubled Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "We try so hard to be better than just another place in
Indonesia," said Mistary Wayan, assistant general manager at an inn
not far from the crater left by the explosion. "But this is a big
bomb. It is very, very bad for us."</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen employees who cleaned up the shattered glass and
destroyed merchandise at the beachwear store have nothing more to do
than nap on display tables and wait for the store to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   Nengah Suartini, 24, worries about losing her job as a salesclerk,
which pays about $50 a month. Her brother works as a hotel waiter.
Her sister-in-law is a receptionist at a resort. Business is down
everywhere since the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We are open, but no person comes here," said Wayan Armini, a
saleswoman at a silver jewelry store cater-cornered from the Sari.
Knots of armed police officers gather in front of her shop,
preventing people from getting closer to the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Paper flower wreaths, sent by local businesses in memory of those
killed, pile up on the sidewalk and around a parked vehicle.
Businesses in the area around the flattened bar -- a restaurant, a
spa, an arts and crafts shop, a bank -- are all shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared because this bomb killed my business," said Agus
Bayon, 28, a manager of a car rental shop within the blocked-off
area. "I'm scared because the next day nobody rented cars and it's
making me bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Just outside the police line, resort manager Abdul Latif wonders
why Bali changed seemingly overnight from a tourist haven to a
terrorist target.</TE>
<TE>   "Bali never had any problems with other people. Why did these
people do this to us?" he asked, sitting in the empty lobby of a
small hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the attack is particularly devastating. The island
had been gearing up for the start of what everyone hoped would be a
strong Christmas season after the Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away
last year. Now it's looking like another free fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally this week through Christmas we are fully booked," said
Kossy Halemai, the general manager at the hotel where the Kingsley
Cats, an Australian football team that lost seven players, had
stayed. "Now we are down to 30% occupancy. I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Even the Cats, who had vowed to stay as long as it took to find
the missing teammates, gave up and left.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done everything we can do. It's up to the scientists now,"
said coach Simon Quayle, referring to the process of DNA
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Most Australians, who account for a large chunk of the tourism
industry here, had already left or were scrambling to go.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Alison and his wife, Collard, had only been here one day
when the explosion shook them so much they wanted to flee as soon as
possible. Two people they had met at the hotel were among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our third time here, but we won't be back for a while," said
Collard Alison as she tried to change her flight. She had just
learned that if she cut her vacation short because of a terrorist
attack, her insurance would not cover any of her losses. But she
doesn't want to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just Bali," she said. "We wouldn't travel anywhere again
until the world has settled down."</TE>
<TE>   It's this kind of attitude that unnerves the Balinese.</TE>
<TE>   "Tourism is our food. Our life is tourism," hotelier Halemai said.
"We'll be losing business for the next six months for sure. But I
believe 100% in the Balinese culture. We will struggle, and we will
come back strong."</TE>

<HD>Sea Change in Santa Monica</HD>
<DH>Wealth drives out funk, and a famous liberal largess is
under attack. The problem, says the mayor, is 'too much success.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne-Marie O'Connor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The radicals ... haven't renamed Santa Monica 'Ho Chi Minh City,'
but if they did, the people who used to rule here -- the
conservatives, the landlords, the developers, the business people --
wouldn't be at all surprised."</LD>
<LD>   -- "60 Minutes," 1982</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Did somebody once talk about a "People's Republic of Santa
Monica"?</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, Santa Monica seems more like Beverly Hills run by the
Green Party.</TE>
<TE>   The city once synonymous with the liberal causes of Tom Hayden and
Jane Fonda is filling up with new People's Republicans who earn a
median income of $90,000 a year. Designer boutiques have eclipsed
mom-and-pop stores on Montana Avenue, giving the street a haughty
affluence more familiar along Rodeo Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The ZIP Code north of Montana Avenue has become a gated community
without a gate. Private patrol cars prowl a mushrooming array of
newly minted monster mansions whose square footage is among the
county's most valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Ever wonder what would happen if the Woodstock generation got
rich? Check out the bourgeois bohemians at Montana's organic grocer.
Choose homeopathic remedies--or "Hemp Plus" frozen waffles--to the
soothing midlife angst of Eric Clapton. "Yogi" Green Tea offers yoga
poses on the box.</TE>
<TE>   To civic boosters anywhere else, this New Age-meets-Gilded Age
might mean success.</TE>
<TE>   But a sense of unease, even guilt, hangs over the place, as if
some people are debating whether Santa Monica should be sister city
to Brentwood or Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the Santa Monica City Council wound up an
emotional debate with the passage of two laws aimed at containing
homeless people--long the beneficiaries of local liberal largess.</TE>
<TE>   Another litmus test comes in November. Voters will face a
referendum intended to overturn an ordinance that mandated a $10.50
"living wage" that was to have taken effect in July for workers on
the ocean-front tourist strip.</TE>
<TE>   The issue taps into a widening fault line of class struggle: Not
everyone who works in Santa Monica can still afford to live there.
Stockbrokers are moving in. Artists are moving on.</TE>
<TE>   "The term 'Beverly Hills-by-the-sea' is what is often used here to
sum up the fear. No offense to Beverly Hills, but this is a different
community," said Santa Monica Mayor Michael Feinstein, 43, a
ponytailed Green Party leader. "Our real challenge is dealing with
too much success. We have a situation where, if we let capitalism run
amok, it will run right over us."</TE>
<TE>   Some say it already has.</TE>
<TE>   Rent control, a cornerstone of Santa Monica liberal politics, now
defers to a state law, enacted in January 2001, allowing landlords to
raise the rents of vacant units to market rates.</TE>
<TE>   The migration of entertainment firms to Santa Monica's new office
park in the mid-1990s accelerated a huge real estate run-up.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys got the idea that entertainment was the biggest clean,
nonpolluting industry, and authorizing these big flashy developments
was the way to attract it," said "Saturday Night Live" veteran Harry
Shearer, whose Sunday morning radio satire, "Le Show," broadcasts
from Santa Monica, which he nicknames "Home of the Homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Allowing residents to seal off their streets with permit parking
"seems elitist for a leftist City Council," he said. "I think of them
more like the current Chinese, who proclaim a left-wing ideology but
maintain Hong Kong and Shanghai as bastions of capitalism. One thing
this town lacks is real bohemians, so I guess pretensions is as close
as we're going to get."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, with his sandals, floppy shorts and hooded Green Party
sweatshirt, seems to embody the counterculture ethos that plucked
Santa Monica from conservative obscurity to the attention of the Free
World.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of meeting at Starbucks ("because of the corporate stuff")
Feinstein invites a reporter to an Ocean Park cafe where the tip jar
reads "Karma."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein came to Santa Monica in 1983 when the sleepy
127-year-old beach town was waking up and turning into "this
deliberately funky place to be," Feinstein recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you could be an individual without breaking the mold and be
seen as going against the crowd," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica was filling up with the cultured bohemians who, as in
San Francisco, Big Sur and New York's SoHo, turned out to be the
improbable advance men and women for gentrification. They proved that
alternative lifestyles and success need not be mutually exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Jackson Browne put it, once upon a time "we were all
hippies. Some of us got rich off music" -- and other counterculture
industries.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, a native of Minnesota, had gotten a degree in
philosophy from Carleton College there and backpacked through Europe,
where he encountered Green Party leaders who "made me realize that,
rather than going to a mountaintop in the Himalayas, I should see how
those feelings of inter-connectedness fit in the real world."</TE>
<TE>   He decided Santa Monica was the place to connect. He lived in his
Volkswagen van and worked as the California sales representative for
an "under-capitalized cottage industry" started by a high school
buddy. It was called "Rollerblade."</TE>
<TE>   "It taught me how to sell a trend," he said. "It taught me how to
sell a new party."</TE>
<TE>   He connected with a pool of liberal activists who were challenging
the city's conservative establishment.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Vivian Rothstein, who was active in the
increasingly powerful renters' rights coalition. In 1979, the
coalition had formed a voting bloc and won passage of local rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, scrawled reds-under-the-bed slogans -- like "Soviet
Monika" -- turned up on walls with red hammers and sickles. One
slogan -- the "People's Republic of Santa Monica" -- was delightedly
co-opted by the city's new radical chic leadership. Rothstein, now a
leader of the campaign to preserve the living wage ordinance, sees
new signs of the times: private jets depositing people at the Santa
Monica Airport and Jaguars driving them off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like this monster that's trying to take us over," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the city that spends so much time thinking about organic
vegetables for school lunches and "green" city conservation practices
can't do much to curb the market forces unleashed by gentrification.</TE>
<TE>   Property values are so ginned up that acquiring land for city
parks is prohibitively expensive. Yet a 2001 survey found just 10% of
city residents listed affordable housing as a vital problem, compared
with 23% the year before.</TE>
<TE>   In a housing market where teardowns can cost over $1 million, a
proposal to set up a new historic district has triggered fighting
words. On one side are longtime homeowners who resent the new
"monster mansions" that tower over older homes. On the other side are
affluent newcomers who want to replace homes 40 or more years old and
do not want the landmarks commission in the way.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinances designed to contain homeless people were prompted
by complaints from the public. One makes it illegal for people to
sleep or sit in doorways on Main Street overnight -- if the merchants
post signs asking them not to do so. Another, designed to limit free
outdoor meals, requires groups serving 150 or more people to adhere
to community event laws and county health standards.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein suggested that the ordinances were bad karma. During the
debate, advocates for the homeless held a prayer vigil. One said the
ordinances would "criminalize charity."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters said the measures were long overdue. "The public is
scared and tired and just generally want it stopped," Councilman Herb
Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Now a coalition of developers is backing efforts to overturn the
ordinance that would obligate nonunion businesses grossing more than
$5 million a year along Santa Monica's tourist strip to pay the
"living wage."</TE>
<TE>   That's about double the federally mandated minimum -- but cheaper
than many Santa Monica hors d'oeuvres.</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of critics like Shearer, these issues are not as
simple as robber barons versus oppressed workers. For one thing,
everybody knows affluent yuppies "making out like bandits" in
rent-controlled apartments, Shearer said. The living wage measure
gives businesses a stone's throw away from the affected ocean-front
district a higher profit margin. And why, he asks, are unionized
businesses exempt?</TE>
<TE>   But, then, many things in Santa Monica are contrarian.</TE>
<TE>   Local millionaires support anti-establishment causes. Yuppies line
up to get kids into Santa Monica's dual Spanish-English immersion
school, while neighboring Los Angeles remains polarized over
bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica, one of the region's most desirable places to live,
is losing population as lower-income families move out and
high-earning singles move in. The 2000 census found 84,000 residents,
down from estimates of more than 91,000 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The city has drafted a plan to create hundreds of units of
affordable housing. Opponents say the liberal council is trying to
bolster its own constituency in the face of challenges on the
horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Another initiative on the ballot, called Veritas, would require
City Council members, now elected at large, to run by district. It
calls for the mayor, who is now chosen by the council, to run
citywide. Veritas supporters argue that district representatives
would be more responsive to things like street repairs and
tree-trimming -- and "bring less ideological people to the City
Council," said Veritas leader Paul DeSantis.</TE>
<TE>   Veritas backers, which included big business, also point to a 1992
city report that concluded that the enactment of the at-large system
in 1946 may have sprung from a desire to minimize the influence of a
growing World War II-era black community. The Pico neighborhood, now
home to a large Latino community, might more easily elect a Latino
representative to the all-white City Council under a district system,
DeSantis said. "In progressive Santa Monica, no one has been elected
from the minority Pico neighborhood to the City Council in 56 years."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein dismisses Veritas as a Trojan horse by living wage
opponents eager to unseat the current City Council and run a
pro-development mayor.</TE>
<TE>   This November will test who holds the balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   The old agitators of the People's Republic are hardly gone, though
some have moved to even tonier confines outside the city. Many of
those who remain are now part of California's moneyed liberal
establishment.</TE>

<HD>Secession Trails in the Valley for First Time</HD>
<DH>Across the city, the breakaway movements, including the one
in Hollywood, are overwhelmingly opposed by voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles voters overwhelmingly oppose breaking up the city and,
for the first time, the idea trails in the San Fernando Valley,
birthplace of the secessionist movement, according to a new Los
Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition appears particularly keen in the East Valley, home to a
greater proportion of Latinos, Democrats and poorer residents than
the rest of the area. Voters in the West Valley, a more conservative
constituency that was behind the six-year campaign to thrust
secession into the voting booth, are now closely divided on the
question.</LD>
<LD>   A parallel drive for Hollywood independence also is faring badly,
the poll indicated. Voters in all parts of the city said they
strongly oppose lopping Hollywood off from the rest of L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Citywide, Valley secession is opposed by majorities of whites,
Latinos and blacks. Most men oppose it, as do most women.
Self-described liberals, moderates and conservatives all said they
favored keeping Los Angeles whole. Majorities of Democrats and
independents said they oppose Valley secession, while Republicans
split evenly for and against the Valley's quest for independence.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to other poll results, the new findings suggest that
secession support has faded considerably in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The new survey found that 56% of likely Los Angeles voters said
they oppose Valley secession, while 27% said they favor it, with the
remaining 17% undecided. Outside the Valley, 62% of respondents said
they oppose letting the Valley go its own way; 18% support it and 20%
were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Likely Valley voters were leaning against the measure, 47% to 42%,
a gap that falls within the poll's margin of error. Eleven percent of
Valley voters said they have yet to make up their minds. Among
registered voters in the Valley, the proposal was behind by six
points.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession is even less popular. Sixty percent of likely
voters citywide said they oppose that area's bid for independence,
compared to just 21% of likely voters favoring it.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, supervised by Times Poll director Susan Pinkus, was
conducted by telephone from Oct. 5 to Oct. 14. It surveyed 1,546
registered voters citywide, of whom 970 were likely voters. For
responses based on likely voters, the poll has a margin of sampling
error of 3 percentage points in either direction. The survey included
464 likely Valley voters with a 5-percentage-point margin of sampling
error.</TE>
<TE>   Among registered voters -- a broader group than likely voters --
support for secession has fallen steadily in recent months. In June,
Valley voters supported secession by a 15-point margin, though it
trailed citywide by 9 points. Today, secession is losing citywide
among registered voters by 32 points and trailing among voters in the
Valley by 6 points.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, support for secession has dropped particularly
among the elderly, Latinos and less-affluent voters.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, the cityhood measures must carry a majority not
only within the breakaway area but also in the entire city.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn's $5-million L.A. United campaign and a slew
of other anti-secession groups are increasingly targeting Valley
renters, senior citizens, Latinos and union members with mailers and
phone calls, hoping to find fertile ground for the message that
cityhood is "too risky."</TE>
<TE>   The poll showed that support for secession both citywide and in
the Valley dipped on Oct. 8, the fourth day of polling and the first
day Hahn's campaign began airing television spots depicting a
spinning roulette wheel and a warning: "Secession is a gamble that's
not worth taking." The percentage of voters favoring a split has
since recovered slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Aversion to secession, moreover, appears to be taking root with
precisely the Valley voters targeted by the mayor's campaign. In the
Valley, nearly two-thirds of those with annual household incomes
under $40,000 -- a group likely to include many renters -- oppose
Valley cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   Senior citizens also are leaning against the measure. Fifty-five
percent of Valley voters 65 or older oppose secession, while 32%
support it.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the money coming from to finance this new city?" poll
respondent Evelyn Burmester, a 76-year-old retired shoe saleswoman
from West Hills, asked in a follow-up interview. "We're going to have
to pay Los Angeles money each year," she said, adding that she lives
on a fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   All told, 54% of likely voters in the East Valley oppose Valley
cityhood and 36% favor it. The margin is much tighter in the West
Valley, where 42% oppose secession and 46% support it, a split within
the poll's margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   While Valley secession is struggling, some of the arguments
against it did not register significantly with many poll respondents.
A majority of voters citywide and in the Valley said, for instance,
that the possibility that a new city might abolish Los Angeles'
living-wage ordinance would not affect their vote. Opposition by the
city's employee unions did not affect many voters either.</TE>
<TE>   The secession campaigns have been hobbled by setbacks for months,
beginning with fund-raising troubles that left them unable to afford
broadcast TV spots to beam their message to the vast Los Angeles
market. Separatists also failed to marshal a high-profile slate of
candidates or the armies of volunteers they once hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   For secession advocates, another challenge has been to create a
sense of urgency around their campaign. In part, that is made more
difficult by a general sense of contentment in Los Angeles. Nearly
six in 10 L.A. voters say things are going pretty well or very well
in the city these days.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bailey, 28, a medical software designer, moved to the Valley
from Pasadena a few months before the cityhood proposals landed on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first moved here, I thought, 'Maybe they're right. Maybe
they're not getting the services they deserve for the tax dollars
they put in,' " said Bailey, who lives in Sherman Oaks. "But ... I
didn't see all the problems they were talking about. They say the
streets are terrible, but they're not ....The police are pretty well
represented. I just don't see what they're complaining about."</TE>
<TE>   One poll finding highlights a problem that breakup advocates
confront with less than a month to go before the election. The
secession campaign began with a largely conservative base. Now, with
election day approaching, that base appears to be divided.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, 45% of self-described conservatives said
they support secession, while 42% oppose it. Citywide, conservatives
oppose it by more than 20 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Among likely voters who favor Valley independence, respondents
cited the prospects of smaller, more efficient government and getting
a fair return for their taxes as their top reasons for supporting a
split.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Valley contributes more than its share to the greater
city of Los Angeles," said Les Benedict, a 58-year-old trombone
player from Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Valley, that argument appears to have persuaded few
voters. While 48% of Valley voters said the Valley receives less than
its fair share of city services and attention, only 4% in the rest of
Los Angeles agreed. Nearly three in 10 voters outside the Valley
named South-Central as the region most deprived of city services.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents cited their belief that secession will increase taxes
and lead to higher costs all around as top reasons for rejecting a
breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "They have nothing to lose and everything to gain,"
Benjamin Rakoff, 72, who lives in the Fairfax area, said of secession
advocates. "But I have everything to lose. It will raise my taxes
and, not only that, it will also be diluting our protection such as
police and fire and ambulances."</TE>
<TE>   Valley voters will be asked to choose a mayor and 14 council
members for their proposed city, but the winners will not take office
if secession fails. That odd dynamic may account for the lack of
passion for any of the mayoral contenders; a hefty 68% of Valley
voters say they are not sure who they will vote for.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) is leading the pack of 10
with 13% of the vote, followed by David Hernandez Jr., an insurance
adjuster who claimed 5%.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotionally, you think, yeah, it would be great to get away from
Los Angeles," said John Ashworth Jones, 67, of Sunland. "But even so,
there's no sense in making things worse by cutting off your nose to
spite your face ....We may wind up with a very unsatisfactory city
run by people who don't know what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists have raised the prospect of filing a
lawsuit if their bid wins in the Valley but fails citywide. They argue
that the Valley should be free to decide its own fate.</TE>
<TE>   But the poll found that 62% of Los Angeles voters agree with the
state law requiring a citywide vote. As with secession itself, Valley
voters were sharply divided over the issue. Nearly half of them, 49%,
said they support the current law -- while nearly half, 46%, said
they oppose it.</TE>

<TE>   How the Poll Was Conducted:</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll contacted 2,248 adults in the city of Los Angeles,
including 1,546 registered voters, by telephone Oct. 5-14. Among the
registered voters, 970 are considered likely to vote. The margin of
sampling error for the overall city sample is plus or minus 2
percentage points; for registered and likely voters, it is 3 points.</TE>
<TE>   To increase the sample size of San Fernando Valley, Latino and
African American likely voters, the main sample was supplemented to
the following totals: 464 likely Valley voters (margin of sampling
error +/- 5 percentage points); 215 likely Latino voters (+/- 6
points); 165 likely African American voters (+/- 8 points). The
samples were then weighted to their proportionate share in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the
city of Los Angeles. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so
that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex,
race, age, education, registration and area of city.</TE>
<TE>   Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as
question wording and the order in which questions are presented.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Asian Americans
were interviewed as part of the entire sample, but there were not
enough of them among likely voters to break out as a separate
subgroup.</TE>

<HD>In Illinois, Sweeping Review of Death Penalty</HD>
<DH>Governor is holding clemency hearings for nearly all of the
state's 160 condemned inmates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- At 9 a.m. Tuesday, in a series of drab state government
conference rooms, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board began an
unprecedented process: considering clemency requests from nearly
every inmate destined for execution by the state.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next week and a half, 142 of the state's 160 death row
inmates will plead for their lives.</LD>
<LD>   By noon Tuesday, the myriad moral quandaries the hearings would
dredge up, the immense anguish and potentially profound political
ramifications, had become clear.</LD>
<TE>   Time after time defense attorneys acknowledged that their clients
were guilty of the crimes that sent them to death row but said the
question of life or death should not come from a system that has
repeatedly failed. Prosecutors, in response, pointed out that the
people of Illinois decided in 1977 to reinstate the death penalty
with the expectation that the most vicious murderers would die for
their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The loved ones of the dead, meanwhile, sobbed.</TE>
<TE>   The system is not perfect, but, Carolyn DeWitt wanted to know,
does that mean that Gov. George Ryan, who ordered the reviews, should
commute to life in prison the death sentence of Donald Armstrong? In
1992, Armstrong murdered DeWitt's aunt. He used 86-year-old Marion
Smigel's own cane to pulverize her skull.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the governor doing this?" DeWitt cried. "Do you know how
much heartache this is bringing to people? And for what reason?"</TE>
<TE>   A former death penalty supporter, Ryan called a moratorium on
executions in Illinois in January 2000, after revelations of serious
flaws in the system. The state has executed 12 people since capital
punishment was reinstated and freed 13 who were wrongfully condemned
to die.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after imposing the moratorium, Ryan appointed a
commission to study the state's death penalty system. In April this
year, the commission released its report. The capital punishment
system was broken, it said, and required a massive overhaul if it was
ever to be used again.</TE>
<TE>   Among the commission's suggestions: Mentally retarded convicts
should not be executed; the state should do away with 15 of the 20
contributing factors that allow juries to impose a death sentence; a
defendant should not be sentenced to death based solely on a single
witness' testimony or the uncorroborated testimony of a jailhouse
informant; trial judges should be allowed to ignore a jury's death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   After the commission released its findings, Ryan ordered the
Prisoner Review Board to hold a hearing on every case in which the
inmate sought clemency. All but 18 of Illinois' death row inmates
asked to have their cases heard.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations of the review board are confidential. Ryan can
review each case individually, or commute all death sentences to
terms of life in prison, or do nothing. In a recent interview, Ryan,
who is known for weighing difficult decisions at the last minute,
said he had not made up his mind as to how he will handle the board's
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the hearings, Cook County State's Atty. Richard
Devine pleaded with the governor: If he already knows he is going to
overturn all death sentences, please say so.</TE>
<TE>   "If, in fact, the governor has his mind made up and plans to grant
wholesale clemency, he should have the decency to cancel these
hearings and spare the families the trauma of reliving their horror
yet again, to no purpose," Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said nothing, and Tuesday morning prosecutors handed victims'
family members yellow lapel ribbons and the hearings commenced in
Chicago and Springfield. All the cases are expected to be heard by
Oct. 25. Inmates do not attend hearings.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first names to be called, in a packed room on the 9th
floor of the James R. Thompson Center downtown, was that of Leonard
Kidd, whose case embodies many of the difficult questions in the
debate about the death penalty. The 48-year-old is a man proponents
and opponents alike can point to in making their arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd was sentenced to death twice, once for intentionally setting
a fire that killed 10 children in 1980 and for stabbing four people
to death during a drug binge.</TE>
<TE>   "There are few others on the planet who have killed more people,"
prosecutor David O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd's attorney, Sharon Hicks, testified that a recent test showed
Kidd had an IQ in the high 50s. In Illinois, a person is considered
legally retarded if he scores 70 or below. (Some prosecutors in the
case, and the relatives of some victims, have claimed that Kidd has
faked diminished mental capacity.)</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Kidd's defenders say he was tortured into confessing
-- an argument expected to be made by at least 10 inmates who were
interrogated in the 1980s at Chicago's Area 2 police headquarters,
where a station commander allegedly sanctioned the torture of
suspects. The detective who questioned Kidd has been accused of
applying electrodes to the testicles of suspects, including Kidd, and
delivering electric shocks.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, just down the hall from Ryan's 16th-floor
offices, four members of the review board were hearing the Armstrong
case.</TE>
<TE>   During a decade in prison for Smigel's murder, Armstrong never
sought a clemency hearing, his attorneys acknowledged, but on Tuesday
they alleged that his confession had been coerced, that his attorney
had been ill during the trial and perhaps unable to defend him
properly, and that various tests place his IQ at between 73 and 76 --
very low, if not indicating legal retardation.</TE>
<TE>   "This case does exemplify many of the reasons the governor's
commission gave as to why the system is broken," defense attorney
John Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a nickel for every time I heard the system was broken
we'd be doing this at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas," James McKay,
the prosecutor on the case, snapped when it was his turn to speak.
"Even if you believe the capital punishment process in the state of
Illinois is broken, it wasn't broken in this case."</TE>
<TE>   McKay pointed out that Armstrong's cousin turned him in to police,
that two of his brothers testified against him during the trial, that
his IQ was not so low that, having broken into Smigel's apartment, he
apparently killed her because she saw his face and could identify
him. He was also smart enough to tell family members he had to get
out of town for a while after the murder, McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   So it went, throughout the day, the vast majority of the witnesses
testifying not to the guilt or innocence of the condemned, but to an
even more difficult question: Should they die for their crimes?</TE>
<TE>   In their appeals, neither Armstrong nor Kidd nor a man named Mark
Ballard ever argued "actual innocence," the legal phrase. Indeed,
during his 1999 trial, Ballard, 41, said he deserved to die for his
crime, and the jury agreed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 he lured a former roommate, Patty Ann Noland, to the house
they once shared in order to rob her. When she arrived, he grabbed
her and held a chloroform-soaked cloth over her mouth until she fell
to the floor. Then he hit her with a hammer, more than 30 times in
the head and face.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Ballard is guilty of this crime," one of his attorneys told
the panel Tuesday. But his defenders added that he suffered from
bipolar disorder and that if the proposed changes to the death
penalty are adopted, a person who committed the same crime might not
meet the requirements for a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, who will bow out of politics in January after one term in
the governor's mansion, has not said he opposes the death penalty,
only that he refuses to allow any executions until he is certain an
innocent person could not possibly be killed.</TE>
<TE>   He ordered the hearings, he said, to help him decide whether to
commute the sentences of some or all death row inmates.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Ryan, who along with several staffers has studied to
varying degrees the cases of every Illinois death row inmate, said in
a recent interview that they believe one or two may in fact be
innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years a handful of governors who philosophically opposed
the death penalty has issued blanket clemencies. In 1970, Arkansas
Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller commuted the death sentences of all 15 of
his state's condemned inmates, and New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya did
the same in 1986, sparing the lives of five killers.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearings revolved less around questions of guilt or
innocence, or even fairness, than around the philosophy and morality
of the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Shame on you, Gov. Ryan," Margie Kalbert, Noland's sister, said
at one point.</TE>
<TE>   David Elliott of the Washington-based National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty applauded Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   "Any justice system that is built by humans is going to contain
some element of human fallibility," he said. "So we have to ask
ourselves: What's the acceptable level of risk? Is it one innocent
person per 100 guilty people? Is it three per hundred?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A dozen Kuwaiti captives have mounted the first
organized legal and diplomatic effort by prisoners at the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay to challenge U.S. policy that holds terrorism
suspects indefinitely without court hearings or charges being filed
against them.</LD>
<LD>   The men, who say they are innocent, are largely backed by the
government of Kuwait, a U.S. ally, in a case that gives voice for the
first time to those captured in the war in Afghanistan and shipped to
the makeshift prison in Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The 12 captives contend they are not members of Al Qaeda or the
Taliban, but charity workers who were assisting refugees of
Afghanistan's harsh regime when they were caught up in the chaos of
the war last fall and winter. In attempting to flee across the
Pakistani border, they say, they fell into the hands of Pakistanis
who "sold" them to U.S. troops, collecting a bounty that American
forces were offering for Arab terrorism suspects captured in the
region.</LD>
<TE>   Now the men have passed nearly a year in captivity and are among
600 men being held inside Camp Delta, a heavily fortified U.S.
military prison on Cuba's Caribbean shore. Federal authorities will
say only that like the rest of the detainees, they are enemy
combatants who are not entitled to certain legal rights.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond the prison's barbed-wire-and-canvas fence, the
Kuwaitis' families are seeking to either win their release or, at a
minimum, see that they are charged with some sort of crime so their
loved ones can plead their cases in a court of law.</TE>
<TE>   "Set me free as I am innocent," Abdulaziz Shammari wrote in a
letter from prison to his father in Kuwait. "Or take me to the court
for trial in order to obtain all my rights. I can not stand life in
this place."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon initially described all the inmates at Guantanamo Bay
as front-line Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters, "the hardest of the
hard."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials have since conceded they have not found any
top-level terrorists among them, and Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said last spring it is possible that some were "victims of
circumstances and probably innocent.... If we find someone's an
innocent and shouldn't have been brought there, they would be
released."</TE>
<TE>   Officials Lend Support</TE>
<TE>   If there are innocents, the Kuwaitis might well be among them.</TE>
<TE>   The families of most of the 12 have collected documents that
suggest the men were indeed working for charitable organizations in
the Afghan region. They have won the support of top Kuwaiti officials
and retained a Washington firm that specializes in international law.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit by the men from Kuwait, and the backing of their
government, is awkward for U.S. policymakers who expect Kuwaiti
support in a war against Iraq and against terrorism generally.</TE>
<TE>   Salem Abdullah Jaber Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S.,
said in an interview in Washington that his country has investigated
the 12 detainees and is convinced that nine have no terrorist
backgrounds and were doing charitable work.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other three, he would say only that there were "certain
impressions" and that there are "questions yet to be answered." He
would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The written plea of prisoner Shammari is among 58 letters and
postcards that the Kuwaitis have mailed home this year. Their
correspondence conveys confusion, religious fervor, loneliness and
fear.</TE>
<TE>   The letters are filled with anguish about the uncertainty of their
fate, the dawning recognition that they may not go home soon, the
heartache of being torn from parents, wives and children, and their
helplessness to prove themselves in court.</TE>
<TE>   They are teachers, engineers and students, according to
leave-of-absence documents signed by their employers approving their
charitable work. One is a government auditor; another works as a
government agriculturist. Some have been fired from their jobs since
their capture. Some knew one another before they arrived at
Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   Among them, there is worry about a mother with cancer and a niece
with a bad heart; three detainees have become fathers in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Fawzi Odah wrote his family: "I swear to God my longing for you is
quite killing me. I am quite anxious to kiss your feet, hands and
heads, and your cheeks too."</TE>
<TE>   The detainees, writing in Arabic on forms provided by the
International Red Cross that they most likely assumed would be read
by their captors, speak well of their treatment at Guantanamo Bay.
Some urge their families to be patient as God eventually will send
them home. One wrote poetically of how he wept at seeing birds flying
about the Cuban island, while another revealed a dream in which God
appeared in his cell and told him his "hands are clean."</TE>
<TE>   Still others seem confused and fearful, unsure whether they are in
Cuba or elsewhere -- some so mistaken as to think they are "close to
home."</TE>
<TE>   "The American army took me and transferred me to many places,"
Saad Madai Azmi wrote. "I do not know where I am now. When I asked I
have been informed that I am in America, but I do not know where I
am."</TE>
<TE>   No Clear-Cut Case</TE>
<TE>   It's not a clear-cut case of innocence, however.</TE>
<TE>   Reports in the Mideast media suggested that one of two Kuwaiti
gunmen who killed a U.S. Marine and wounded another last week was a
cousin of one of the 12 Guantanamo Bay captives -- a report that has
yet to be substantiated and is emphatically denied by their families
and lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, the detainees cited eight charitable organizations for
which they worked, and one of them -- the Kuwait-based Revival of
Islamic Heritage Society -- has been identified by the U.S. as
supporting the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   And one detainee, Fouad Rabiah, took flight engineering classes at
the same Florida school where some of the Sept. 11 hijackers later
studied.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuwaiti government isn't saying all of the men are innocent,
but it simply wants the United States to evaluate its countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   "Let them be put on trial," Ambassador Sabah said. "If they are
innocent, let them go. If they are guilty, we will deal with that.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing will solve this issue until they are given due process."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are no trials or military tribunals on the horizon.
Instead, the U.S. government maintains that it can continue to hold
all of the detainees until the end of the war on terrorism. When that
might be is far from clear, but the commander of the Guantanamo naval
base said last month that he is making plans for expanding his
capacity to hold more prisoners for even longer periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   In their first days of captivity, before being turned over to
American authorities, several of the 12 Kuwaitis wrote a letter to
the emir in Kuwait and the Kuwaiti ambassador in Pakistan, imploring
them to help. They described working for charitable groups in the
region and then being swept up in the "agonies of war."</TE>
<TE>   They said they were taken out of Afghanistan by a Pakistani guide,
and that local village leaders "sold" them to American forces. "This
is our third day in the prison where we are suffering very difficult
conditions, similar to that of animals," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   They signed their letter, "Your subjects in a Pakistani prison."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, leaflets had been distributed around the Afghan
region offering financial rewards to anyone who turned over Arab
terrorist suspects. It was much later that the families discovered
their sons and husbands had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Odah, a colonel in the Kuwaiti air force when the U.S.
helped liberate his country in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, was alarmed
to learn his 25-year-old son, a religious teacher, was imprisoned in
Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "My son was with me when the U.S. troops leading the coalition
forces came to liberate us," the father recalled in an interview from
Kuwait. "He has a great love for the Americans. You can understand
that, imagining a 14-year-old then seeing these troops coming to
liberate his country."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the father said, his son "cannot understand how the Bush
administration can act like this."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the father helped form the Kuwaiti Family Committee of
the Kuwaiti Detainees at Guantanamo Bay. They met with Kuwaiti
officials, and their government started asking questions.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. communiques to the Kuwait government posed questions of
their own. The U.S. wanted to know what legal action Kuwait "may be
prepared to take against your citizens in U.S. control at Guantanamo
Bay," should they ever be released.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. listed the detainees by name, and asked, "Would these
persons be subject to prosecution in your country, and if so, for
what crimes?" The U.S. also wanted to know "what types of punishments
are available under your law for offenses that have been or might be
brought against these persons in your country?"</TE>
<TE>   In April, the families took their case to the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, where they were told that "all the persons being held were
captured in combat with the United States and are therefore prisoners
of war," according to Abdul Rahman R. Haroun, a Kuwaiti attorney
assisting the families.</TE>
<TE>   The families then turned to the Washington law firm of Shearman &amp;
Sterling. On July 8, attorneys Thomas B. Wilner and Kristine A.
Huskey filed suit in federal district court here. They asked that the
detainees be allowed to meet with their families, be informed of any
charges against them, be able to confer with their lawyers and "have
access to the courts or some other impartial tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has forcibly taken, transported and jailed them
against their will. It has deprived them of their liberty," Wilner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was dismissed on July 30 when Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly sided with the government's position that the U.S.
courts have no jurisdiction in the matter because Guantanamo Bay is
outside the sovereignty of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers have asked for another hearing before the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Oral arguments are set for
Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, U.S. officials allowed a delegation of Kuwaiti
authorities to meet with the detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Once again,
hopes ran high among the 12 men, as Abdullah Ajmi, a 28-year-old
former Kuwait lance corporal, described the meeting in a letter sent
to his father.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat together and by Allah willing I will be out of this jail,"
he wrote his family. "We [will] meet together very soon."</TE>
<TE>   The delegation also met in Washington with CIA Director George J.
Tenet, among other U.S. officials. The Kuwaiti officials subsequently
briefed the families, who got the impression that Tenet had promised
that at least nine of the detainees would be released soon, perhaps
as early as the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "If Mr. Tenet has promised something, I would love to believe him,
just to get some hope for a while," Mansour Kamel, the brother of
detainee Abdullah Kamel, 29, said in an interview from Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. intelligence sources, while confirming the meeting with
Tenet, insisted that no such assurances were made.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing promised," said one intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   Families Have Suffered</TE>
<TE>   Life has not been good for the families in Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Monther Rabiah said his detainee brother, Fouad, the 43-year-old
airplane engineer, is very "soft and gentle, the most softhearted one
of all of us." He is not a terrorist, the brother insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "When, I don't know, but yes I shall see him again," Monther said
by phone from Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   "For somebody who leaves the comfort of their house and goes
abroad to deliver food to a hungry old man and a widow and a child,
God won't let them suffer for too long a time.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe God will examine him, but he won't let him suffer long."</TE>
<TE>   The detainees are hungry for news from home.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Amin, a 37-year-old Kuwaiti government agricultural
supervisor, asked about his wife's pregnancy. "Call the baby Aishah
if she is female, and Abdulwahab if he is a boy. Then please
slaughter one ram if she is a girl and two rams if he is a boy, and
distribute the meat on the poor and the needy.</TE>
<TE>   "Further please cut the hair of the baby, weigh it and distribute
its equivalent weight in gold."</TE>
<TE>   A girl was born last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The men are intensely focused on when they might face a court or
military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "The American investigator himself told me that there is nothing
against me, thanks to God," Fayiz Kandari, 27, wrote hopefully on
Dec. 23.</TE>
<TE>   By August, his tone had changed. "We are in terrible isolation
from the world and I am very worried. We are still in cages."</TE>
<TE>   Shammari, a 29-year-old teacher, joined scores of other detainees
in a prolonged hunger strike beginning in early March.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they state they are going to release me soon, but
unfortunately this is far away," he wrote his father on March 24.</TE>
<TE>   "I will continue my strike [for] an indefinite period.</TE>
<TE>   "Further I have gone on strike for water and speech for four
days."</TE>
<TE>   He said that "some persons in America want to achieve electoral
gains on our account." He instructed his father to "take this message
to the Kuwaiti press so that they know the reality as it is."</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, his hunger strike over, he was much less
strident. "If man does not tell lies, Almighty God will save and
release him from his troubles. Our prophet, peace and blessings be
upon him, says that truth means rescue."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, on the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks,
he told his father: "About me, nothing new. Days come and days go,
night comes and night goes."</TE>

<TE>   War prisoners plead for release</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A dozen captive Kuwaitis at Guantanamo Bay are challenging their
detainment. They claim they were charity workers helping war refugees
when they were captured in Afghanistan. A look at some of the
prisoners:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Detainees</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Abdulaziz Shammari, 29, comes from a large family--he is one of
nine brothers and he also has two sons of his own. He left Kuwait on
Oct. 15 for Pakistan, and once phoned his family to report that he
was trying to aid local groups there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fayiz Kandari, a 27-year-old student, traveled to the Kandahar
area of Aghanistan several months before Sept. 11, 2001. He told his
family he was helping with relief assistance, digging water wells and
repairing mosques. When the bombs fell, he said, he was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Naser Mutairi, 25, is a preacher who told his family he went to
Pakistan in November to pray in small mosques and schools there. He
reported that he was captured a month later, fell ill, and then was
hurt again during a riot at a Chinese hospital in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Letters Home</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In this letter to his father, Fayiz Kandari describes his life in
Guantanamo Bay, where the detainees are housed in small cages that
leave them depressed by the ``terrible isolation'' they feel:</TE>
<TE>   ``... We are in terrible isolation from the world and I am very
worried about you mother, I pray to God that you are all right.
Regarding our situation, it is to be known that following the brutal
Nazi treatment in Kandahar and provocation from the soldiers here,
now the situation is quite good and better than before. However we
are still in cages of two meters multiplied in two meters dimensions.
I swear by God that I am sure that release will be very soon...''</TE>

<HD>Clues Emerge in Sniper Probe</HD>
<DH>The 11th shooting, in which FBI analyst died, produces more
leads than earlier attacks. Authorities examine 'individuals of
interest.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun, Greg Miller and Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Police investigating the Beltway serial murder
spree pursued a wealth of new witness reports Tuesday and eyed a
growing list of "individuals of interest" as authorities confirmed
that the unseen killer had gunned down one of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Several witnesses who heard the single rifle shot that killed FBI
analyst Linda Franklin in a Falls Church, Va., shopping mall Monday
night were able to recount partial numbers from the plates of a white
van seen near the crime scene, officials said. Police were also
reportedly working on their first sketch of a possible suspect -- a
graphic of a dark-skinned man sighted inside a white van.</LD>
<LD>   But one task force official cautioned that while police had "more
people in the area this time making observations" than at previous
shooting sites, the latest accounts do not yet amount to a break in
the case. "How he's doing it and what his methods are, we still don't
know," the official said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. military also was drawn into the hunt for the killer. A
Pentagon official said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld approved
an FBI request Tuesday to use military surveillance planes to sweep
the Washington metropolitan area, capturing video images that could
help track the sniper on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they had no evidence suggesting that the
rifle-toting killer might have purposely targeted Franklin, 47,
because of her civilian FBI job as a researcher analyzing terrorist
threats. But FBI officials were hit hard by the revelation that the
sniper had slain a four-year employee and mother of two.</TE>
<TE>   Gary M. Bald, the FBI special agent coordinating the bureau's team
in the sniper probe, said federal agents were airlifted to the
shooting scene "within minutes" Monday night after learning
Franklin's identity.</TE>
<TE>   "She did an exceptional job for us and we're going to miss her,"
Bald said. Another FBI official said Franklin's co-workers at FBI
headquarters in downtown Washington were devastated: "It's just [one]
more nail in the wall that makes us want to do whatever we can to
catch this guy."</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of Franklin's slaying amounted to a grim
repetition of the sniper's brazen pattern. Like eight other victims
in the last two weeks, she was killed from a distance by a single
.223-caliber gunshot as she was going about her daily business -- in
her case, loading packages with her husband in the parking lot of a
Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses were unable to provide any solid firsthand accounts of
Franklin's slaying, the task force official said. The lack of
eyewitness evidence has hampered police repeatedly over the two weeks
that the gunman has crisscrossed the Washington area, killing nine
people and seriously wounding two.</TE>
<TE>   "The crime scene is distant," the official said. Witnesses "are
not near where the shooting occurred, and when they look up, the
first thing they pick up is vehicles driving away."</TE>
<TE>   But investigators said the aftermath of Franklin's slaying offered
some strands of hope.</TE>
<TE>   There were more witnesses than at any other shooting scene, the
official said. Some offered a flurry of new details -- including
partial tag numbers of vehicles leaving the scene. And at least one
witness reportedly provided a description of a dark-skinned occupant
of a white van.</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by a similar earlier report, and after the sniper's 10th
shooting on Friday, police briefly detained a Georgia man who said
detectives referred to a video scan of a similarly dark-skinned man
as they interrogated him.</TE>
<TE>   But Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who is
leading the police task force, warned that police were far from ready
to issue a sketch of any suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd love to come forth and show you the mug shots of the person
suspected," Moose said. But he said police feared that prematurely
releasing vague information could "contaminate" the effort to catch
the suspect or suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have information we feel needs to be placed in the public
arena, we will do that," Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax County, Va., Police Chief Tom Manger said: "There was some
additional information that we were able to get from [Monday] night's
case, and I am confident that information is going to lead to an
arrest."</TE>
<TE>   But Manger declined to verify a report that a witness had reported
several numbers from a Maryland plate on one van. "We are not ready
to release any tag information," Manger said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, police sent out a bulletin on a white van seen
driving off from the Home Depot lot. Witnesses said the vehicle had a
ladder rack and a burned-out left taillight. A similar vehicle was
reported in the vicinity of a sniper slaying near Fredericksburg,
Va., last week, and police released a composite graphic of that van
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to use this to jog people's memories," Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of detectives have also been investigating the backgrounds
of a list of "between five and 20" individuals whose names have
surfaced from tips and records checks over the two-week probe.</TE>
<TE>   The task force official described the list as "fluid," shrinking
and growing as names are dropped and others are added. Investigators
culled many of the names from tips that have poured in by the
hundreds each day. Others were prompted by methodical scans through
firearm registries, motor vehicle listings and arrest records. All of
the subjects, the official said, are undergoing intensive
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these people we've eliminated from suspicion pretty
quickly," he said. "There are others whose names stick around.
They're the ones we're obviously interested in."</TE>
<TE>   Even as the detective teams continued that basic investigative
work, federal officials drew in military officials to lend high-tech
support to the search for the sniper. Pentagon officials already had
mined the service records of military marksmen, trying to weed out
any who might have shown signs of mental instability aligned with
that of serial killers. The search, requested by the police task
force, had found nothing substantial, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Rumsfeld agreed to a second FBI request to borrow
military aircraft to track the sniper from the air. Military experts
said there were several aircraft that might be well-suited for such a
mission, including Army RC-7 reconnaissance planes, and Navy P-3
Orion aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The propeller-driven craft are equipped with telescopic cameras
able to capture detailed images of vehicles or other subjects from
altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet, said John Pike, an analyst at
Globalsecurity.org.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as you get a report of a shooting, they would train a
camera on the location and start panning around in an expanding
circle," Pike said.</TE>
<TE>   Both types of aircraft have been used extensively in drug
surveillance operations, and may already be equipped with radios
operating on police frequencies, Pike said. He added that the planes'
lenses are unable to penetrate cloud cover.</TE>
<TE>   In agreeing to the FBI request, Pentagon officials took care not
to order military personnel operating the planes to work directly for
the task force. Pilots and other military officials would answer to
orders from their own superiors and only turn over the information
they had received to the task force. That relationship is being
tailored carefully so that it poses no violation of a 19th century
legislative prohibition against the armed forces' engaging in
domestic law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all its latest high-tech weaponry, the task force's
burgeoning assets have helped little in the moments after the killer
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after Franklin was shot dead near her car on Monday night,
scores of Virginia State Police and local officers shut down sections
of Washington's Beltway in an attempt to snare the killer.</TE>
<TE>   But the sniper's timing has been impeccable. Investigators concede
that he is likely already on the move by the time witnesses react to
the sound of the high-powered rifle blast, then provide their
accounts to investigators. And by the time police arrive and summon
reinforcements, the killer may already be miles down the highway or
disappearing on a lightly traveled side road.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only do what we can at the time," said Cpl. Rob Moroney, a
Maryland State Police official and spokesman for the task force.
"We'd rip out our hair thinking what could have been."</TE>
<TE>   About 10 minutes after Franklin was shot down, an army of police
departments surged out to the highways, backing up traffic for miles.
Police turned sections of Interstates 95, 66 and 495, and other
roads, into nighttime parking lots, trying to block the shooter from
escaping into Maryland or the District of Columbia, just six miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to make sure that if the vehicle was on the George
Washington Parkway, we would find it," said Sgt. Scott Fear, a
spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, one of many law enforcement
agencies taking part in the extraordinary dragnet.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers said local Virginia police lost precious minutes
taking control of the roads near the shooting. The 911 call about a
shooting came into the Fairfax County Police Department at 9:19 p.m.
About 10 minutes passed before police issued a bulletin with a
description of a light-colored van with a left rear taillight burned
out. The suspect van was last seen heading east on U.S. 50, a major
artery connecting the Virginia suburbs to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Not until 9:30 p.m. did Virginia State Police shut down ramps and
portions of the major interstates around the Home Depot. All bridges
leading out of Virginia were closed. Lighting the ground with searing
white rays, two Maryland state police helicopters and one from
Virginia patrolled the area around the Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   "We had troopers on almost every ramp checking vehicles and
working with the county police, doing everything we could at their
request," said Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   But if the white van continued east on U.S. 50, the road it was
last seen on, "10 minutes after the shooting, you could be into
D.C.," conceded Arlington Police public information officer Matt
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Adriana Velasquez, 35, who lives across the road from the Home
Depot, heard the rifle blast Monday night, but by the time she
reached her window, there was no white van.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew right away what it was," she said, recalling the gun's
echo. "You can't mistake it."</TE>
<TE>   At midday Monday, the Velasquez family crossed U.S. 50 and made
their way to the spot where Franklin fell the night before.</TE>
<TE>   They held votive candles and white flowers in their fists. They
lighted the wicks, and feeble light quivered in the dim garage.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts us that somebody would kill a stranger for no reason at
all," Velasquez said. "It isn't right. We're all one flesh."</TE>

<HD>4 With Alleged Al Qaeda Ties Arrested</HD>
<DH>Pakistani police assisted by the FBI raid a refugee camp in
area that voted in Islamic hard-liner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistani police backed by FBI agents arrested four men Tuesday
suspected of close ties to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The four, all from Afghanistan, were arrested in a raid at the
Jalozai refugee camp, about 25 miles east of Peshawar, they said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities seized documents, a computer and a mobile phone. Two
passports also were confiscated, one from Afghanistan and the other
from Saudi Arabia, officers said.</LD>
<TE>   The operation was based on information provided by the FBI, which
has been working with Pakistan in the war against terrorism,
Pakistani officials said. It was unclear how many FBI agents took
part in the raid, which used armored personnel carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The names of two suspects, Sayed Abdur Rehman and Abdul Ghaffar,
matched names of people on an FBI wanted list, a Pakistani security
official in the operation said. The others were identified as Akhtar
Mohammed and Mohammed Idrees.</TE>
<TE>   The Jalozai refugee camp is run by the Ittihad-i-Islami, a group
made up of former Afghan fighters who fought the Soviet invasion in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The camp is in the Nowshera district, where voters last week
elected to parliament Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the leader of a hard-line
Islamic party that ran on an anti-American platform. Ahmed calls for
the removal of U.S. forces, who have used facilities in Pakistan to
launch military campaigns in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Pakistani and U.S. security forces have raided
several suspected Al Qaeda hide-outs, particularly in remote areas
near the border with Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Pakistani police in the southern port city of
Karachi arrested Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected planner of the Sept.
11 attacks in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Approval Rating Is Up</HD>
<DH>Picking Bratton as the new police chief helps boost mayor's
support, a Times poll finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's public approval rating has climbed
to its highest level since he took office, spurred in part by his
selection of William J. Bratton as the city's next police chief, a
new Times poll has found.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of city residents -- 54% -- support the way the
mayor is doing his job, while 22% disapprove. Four months ago, 46%
backed him in a Los Angeles Times Poll, and 26% registered
disapproval.</LD>
<LD>   In the June survey, some respondents cited their unhappiness with
Hahn's decision to deny former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks a second
term. This time, by contrast, the mayor's approval appears to have
been helped by his choice of Bratton, a former New York police
commissioner.</LD>
<TE>   In the latest poll, 52% of those asked said they supported the
mayor's selection of Bratton, compared with just 17% who disapproved
of the choice.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has had two controversial and divisive issues to
deal with in the last year: the secession movements in Hollywood and the
San Fernando Valley, as well as his decision to replace the police
chief.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carrick, a political consultant who is running Hahn's
campaign against secession, said the police chief selection was a
high-stakes move politically that played out against the backdrop of
the breakaway movements.</TE>
<TE>   "Last time we changed police chiefs, the controversy was around
Chief [Willie] Williams personally to some extent.... This time was
not only around Chief Parks personally, but also around what kind of
police chief you want, what kind of police department you want,"
Carrick said. "We all knew it would be a big issue, but I think it
was even bigger than we thought."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those polled said in follow-up interviews that they
believe Hahn is trying to make the city safer by hiring Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Haro, a Van Nuys father of two and a restaurant manager, said he
believes the mayor is moving in the right direction to improve public
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't done anything to disappoint me," Haro said. "I like his
[Bratton's] style. I like what I've heard about him."</TE>
<TE>   The survey, supervised by Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus, was
conducted Oct. 5-14. It surveyed 2,248 people citywide -- 1,546 of
whom were registered voters. For citywide responses based on
registered voters, it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's rejection of a second term for Parks still looms large
among many African Americans, who overwhelmingly supported him for
mayor; 41% said they now support the mayor and 45% said they
disapprove of his performance.</TE>
<TE>   Alberta Moore of Leimert Park is one of those polled who said she
disapproves of Hahn's performance thus far. She said the mayor has
seemed to reel from one crisis to the next, from security concerns
after last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to secession to the task
of picking a new police chief.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things we need to focus on as a city," Moore
said, adding that she believes the mayor is "distracted."</TE>
<TE>   But she said she gives Hahn credit for making a tough decision on
the police chief. Parks, who devoted his career to the LAPD, "proved
the insider is not the solution," she said, adding that she is
"quietly optimistic" about Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Guerra, director of the study of Los Angeles at Loyola
Marymount University, said publicity surrounding the mayor's
selection of a new police chief probably helped build support.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bound to go up," Guerra said. "It was so public, Hahn's
name and picture were out there quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the mayor's support appears to be building in the Valley,
where 55% of those polled support him, compared with 44% in the June
survey.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's doing the best he can," said Ethel Swanson, a
retired teacher who lives in Woodland Hills. "He's making reasonable
progress."</TE>

<HD>Bowlers Halt Kidnapping, Officials Say</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WINDHAM, N.H.</DL>
<LD>A group of bowlers who stopped a man from leaving a bowling alley
with an 8-year-old girl helped thwart a kidnapping, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Gerard Bean, 55, was arraigned on a charge of attempted child
abduction Tuesday, two days after he allegedly left the alley with
the girl.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no doubt in my mind that he planned to take that girl,"
officer Ed Fedele said.</LD>
<TE>   A judge set bail at $250,000 after prosecutor Catherine Baumann
said Bean had been convicted of kidnapping and served time in prison
from 1979 to 1988. No plea was entered.</TE>
<TE>   Bean was arrested Sunday night after being confronted by several
bowlers who saw the girl follow him out of Park Place Bowling Lanes,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The men said Bean told them that he hadn't realized the girl was
following him. But the girl, who was with her father at the bowling
alley, said Bean claimed to be her uncle and told her to come with
him, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   After the bowlers questioned him for a few minutes, Bean began
walking toward the front door, bowler Scott Bradish said.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave us the thumbs up and said, 'You guys are good for doing
this because there are some real sickos out there,' " Bradish said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bean was quickly surrounded by nearly 100 bowlers who called
police, Bradish said.</TE>

<LD>When Trish Roberts was 14, she learned she was born without a uterus,
making her unable to bear children.</LD>
<LD>   "We told her at that time, if the good Lord was willing, I would
carry for her when the time came," said her mother, Sharon Dunn.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts and her husband, Mike, had a frustrating experience trying
to adopt a child three years ago and then were reminded of a woman
who carried twins for her daughter. The couple, both 25, took Dunn up
on her offer to be a surrogate mother.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Dunn, 48, gave birth to twin granddaughters, Kaitlyn
and Shelby.</TE>
<TE>   The girls were delivered by Caesarean section and have been in the
neonatal intensive-care unit at Rapid City Regional Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It still seems like a dream," said Roberts, holding Kaitlyn.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Roberts' eggs were fertilized with her husband's sperm and
implanted in Dunn's womb. "We implanted two embryos with a 50-50
chance that one would take. They both did," Roberts said.</TE>

<LD>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Maria Hsia, a Democratic
fund-raiser convicted of hiding more than $100,000 in illegal
contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection effort and other
campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Without comment, the justices let stand a federal appeals court
ruling upholding Hsia's conviction. The L.A.-based immigration
consultant was sentenced to three years of probation, 250 hours of
community service and a $5,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   Hsia set up a visit April 29, 1996, by Vice President Al Gore to
the Hsi Lai Temple near L.A. Gore attended the event, but said he
didn't know it was for fund-raising.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A study prompted by an urban myth circulated on the Internet shows
there is no evidence that antiperspirants or deodorants cause breast
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The study, in this week's Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, examined the personal hygiene habits of 813 women with
breast cancer and 793 women without the disease and found no link
between cancer and body odor control cosmetics.</LD>
<LD>   "Antiperspirant and deodorant use did not differ whether or not a
participant [in the study] had breast cancer," said Dana K. Mirick,
an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle. This indicates, she said, that use of such products does not
cause cancer.</LD>

<HD>Gephardt Offers Economic Stimulus Package</HD>
<DH>House minority leader criticizes Bush's policy. He proposes
$200-billion plan of tax cuts and spending, some of which GOP
receives warmly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt called
Tuesday for $200 billion in new federal spending and tax cuts to rev
up the economy, and the White House offered a strikingly encouraging
response to his proposed tax relief.</LD>
<LD>   Laying out an alternative economic agenda if his party retakes the
House in the closely fought Nov. 5 elections, the Missouri Democrat
said the lackluster economy needs an immediate boost of $125 billion
in spending and $75 billion in tax cuts and rebates for working-class
families and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Gephardt, in his speech here, also pushed for familiar Democratic
priorities: a raise in the minimum wage to $6.65 an hour from the
current $5.15; an extension of unemployment benefits; a new system to
protect worker pensions; a crackdown on excessive compensation for
corporate chief executives; cuts in federal subsidies for
corporations and a "budget summit" to help erase a long-term federal
deficit.</LD>
<TE>   Peppering his words with strong criticism of the Bush
administration, Gephardt declared: "The fact is America faces a clear
and present danger to the economic life of working families. But all
the president and the Republican House have offered is an extremist
ideology of trickle-down economics and ineffective gimmicks."</TE>
<TE>   In large part, the speech was the latest Democratic effort to
focus the attention of voters on the economy before the midterm
elections, after weeks of debate about Iraq and other national
security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   And normally, an economic manifesto from a top Democrat three
weeks before the congressional elections would draw nothing but scorn
from top Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) dismissed
Gephardt's initiative as "nothing more than the discredited Democrat
tax-and-spend scheme concealed behind a fresh Beverly Hills face
lift."</TE>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer's response was far
more receptive. President Bush's spokesman shrugged off Gephardt's
partisan rhetoric and focused instead on an area of potential
agreement. "The idea of tax incentives to help stimulate growth is
always an interesting idea," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to say the president is willing to embrace everything
Congressman Gephardt said. But he gave an interesting speech."</TE>
<TE>   In the speech, delivered at the Economic Policy Institute, a
liberal think tank, Gephardt proposed spending $25 billion on school
construction, $25 billion on new protections against terrorism and
$75 billion on health-care programs for the needy.</TE>
<TE>   He also opened the door to new tax cuts -- an idea that could gain
steam when the new Congress convenes in January. His plan calls for
$75 billion in tax rebates or credits "for working families" -- he
was not more specific -- and business investment incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt, as he has before, also criticized the 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut enacted last year at Bush's urging.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the federal budget has plunged back into deficit
under the president's watch.</TE>
<TE>   Like most other leading Democrats, he was silent on whether
provisions of the tax law should be rolled back or frozen.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a fresh wrinkle, he said Congress should consider
imposing budget "triggers" or "caps," mechanisms that could be used
to reduce spending or trim elements of the Bush tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt is leading the Democratic effort to overcome a 223-208
Republican majority and end eight years of GOP rule in the House.
(Three seats in the 435-member chamber formerly held by Democrats are
vacant, one is held by a Democrat-leaning independent.)</TE>
<TE>   He also is eyeing a possible run for president in 2004 against
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
delivered an economic speech harshly critical of the Bush
administration. Daschle, fighting to keep or expand his party's
one-seat Senate edge, said the president and his advisors have
glossed over danger signs such as a falling stock market and rising
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   ''I don't know where these guys are living, but it must be
somewhere within the neighborhood of oblivious,'' Daschle said on the
Senate floor. ''When it comes to America's economic problems, this
administration is woefully out of touch.''</TE>
<TE>   Republicans reply that the Senate, under Daschle's leadership
since June 2001, has failed to act on a raft of measures that would
help the economy.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Senate needs to do something,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). ''And we, right now, are just not producing.''</TE>

<HD>Einhorn Reads Diary Entries for Jurors</HD>
<DH>In second day on stand, he admits beating two women who
ended relationships with him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA -- Under cross-examination designed to convict him with
words from his own diaries, Ira Einhorn said Tuesday that he was
jealous and angry at the prospect of his former girlfriend leaving
him, but denied killing her.</LD>
<LD>   The former counterculture guru, in his second day on the witness
stand, admitted beating two other women who had ended relationships
with him.</LD>
<LD>   Einhorn appeared testy at times when prosecutor Joel Rosen forced
him to read from diaries detailing failed love affairs. Even though
he had angry feelings about Helen "Holly" Maddux, he never acted on
his anger, Einhorn said. He is charged with beating her to death and
stowing her remains in a steamer trunk.</LD>
<TE>   "I was in control of myself enough not to allow those buttons to
be pushed," he told a jury that is expected to begin deliberations
this week.</TE>
<TE>   In his diary, Einhorn expressed turmoil, rejection and loss when
Maddux announced in 1977 that their sometimes stormy five-year
relationship was finished and she planned a 12-day boat trip with
another man.</TE>
<TE>   But Einhorn testified Tuesday that he believed the separation was
not permanent because she was planning to live nearby and had left
him in the past, only to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not consider committing acts of violence against Holly
Maddux," Einhorn said. "The relationship was not over.... There is no
reason to kill someone because she is moving across the street from
you."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor questioned Einhorn about passages he wrote
involving violent impulses.</TE>
<TE>   One diary entry concerned Judith Sabot, a former girlfriend who
testified that Einhorn hit her over the head with a Coke bottle and
tried to strangle her when she ended their relationship in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "Violence creeps over my body when I reach towards the destruction
of Judy," read a diary entry written before the alleged assault.
"Violence always marks the end of a relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Asked by the assistant district attorney about the meaning of the
passage, Einhorn replied: "This is a description we can find in any
literary discussion when a male is being honest about some things.</TE>
<TE>   "This is literature. This is destroying the part of her that
resides in me."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen then asked about Rita Resnick, whom Einhorn allegedly
strangled until her face turned red when their romance collapsed in
1962.</TE>
<TE>   "To beat a woman, what joy," his diary entry said on the day that
prosecutors claim he attacked Resnick.</TE>
<TE>   The diary contained another entry the next day: "To kill what you
love when you can't have it seems so natural that strangling Rita
last night seemed so right."</TE>
<TE>   Looking uncomfortable during questioning, Einhorn sought to
explain to the jury of six men and six women that the writings were
"metaphorical violence" -- literary devices used by William
Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us don't hit our girlfriends with Coke bottles, do we?"
Rosen asked.</TE>
<TE>   But William T. Cannon, Einhorn's defense lawyer, quickly objected
and the question was stricken from the record.</TE>
<TE>   During rebuttal testimony, Cannon asked Einhorn to read aloud
about Maddux, who had traveled from Texas to attend Bryn Mawr College
near Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed conservatively in a dark suit and striped tie, his gray
hair closely cropped, Einhorn bore little resemblance to the man who
described himself as a "planetary enzyme" -- a flamboyant hippie with
an establishment following in Philadelphia decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Her beauty a horrible block in dealing with others -- an angel
lingers in my mind," Einhorn said, reading a diary entry.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes filled with tears, which he wiped away.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen suggested that the passage could have been written to
provide an alibi after Maddux's killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not kill Holly Maddux and put entries in the diary later,"
Einhorn said angrily.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn is accused of killing Maddux, who was 30 at the time, on
Sept. 11, 1977, when she went to the apartment they once shared to
retrieve her belongings after he threatened to throw them into the
street. Police found her mummified remains in a locked trunk in a
closet in the apartment March 28, 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before his murder trial was to start in 1981, Einhorn
jumped bail and fled the country. He was a fugitive in France for two
decades before being extradited last year.</TE>

<HD>Detainees' Overseer Loses Stateside Role</HD>
<DH>National Guard relieves him of duties after what they say
were problems in communications.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The National Guard general who just completed a
seven-month tour as head of the security detail for detainees at the
U.S. Naval Base on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has suddenly found himself
without a job at his Rhode Island National Guard headquarters as
well.</LD>
<LD>   Brig. Gen. Rick Baccus was told that he is being relieved of
National Guard duties because he failed to keep his state supervisors
up to date on personnel matters and other events while in Cuba, Guard
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   His Rhode Island supervisors, as well as his commanders at
Guantanamo Bay, said the action had nothing to do with his work
overseeing the hundreds of guards detailed to police the 600 terror
suspects detained there.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Michael McNamara, spokesman for the Rhode Island unit,
said Baccus was repeatedly told to keep the Guard apprised of all
matters relating to the 110 local members of the Guard who went with
him to Cuba, and he ''consistently'' failed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   McNamara said the breaking point came when a National Guard
captain from Rhode Island suffered a burst appendix and was
transferred to the Walter Reed Army hospital in Washington, and
officials in Rhode Island were never notified.</TE>
<TE>   ''That may sound trivial. But there was seven months of other
happenings and Gen. Baccus inherently failed to communicate with us.</TE>
<TE>   "It just got to the point where we lost all faith and confidence
in him.''</TE>
<TE>   Military officials overseeing Guantanamo Bay said his departure
from the prison facility was preordained because of consolidation at
the detention facility, and that a ceremony was held honoring his
service in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   He did a ''stellar'' job there as the makeshift prison grew into a
semi-permanent facility.</TE>
<TE>   Baccus, 50, who has returned home to Exeter, R.I., and his
civilian job at a nearby veterans cemetery, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   But he told local radio station WPRO-AM that he was bewildered
over losing his guard post.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm a little amazed,'' he said, ''that after being deployed for
seven months, separated from my wife, my family and my job, and then
this is the kind of reception I'm getting.''</TE>

<HD>House Passes Bill to Improve Gun-Buyer Background Checks</HD>
<DH>Control advocates say the measure will accomplish little.
The vote occurs amid a deadly sniper spree and election campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- With deadly sniper bullets whistling around Washington,
the House approved a bill Tuesday to improve the database used to
check gun buyers -- the first gun-regulation measure to come before
Congress in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   But critics said the measure, which was supported by the National
Rifle Assn., would do little to control the availability of guns. And
few politicians are calling for any tougher measures in response to
the spate of area shootings -- an indication of how dramatically the
debate on the issue has changed in the last three years.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, after the bloody shooting rampage at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., Democrats led a stampede for new limits
on gun purchases and activists helped stage such events as the
Million Mom March. The legislative effort ultimately stalled, but it
thrust gun control to the center of the 2000 presidential and
congressional campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   Now, by contrast, gun control has come up as a campaign issue in
only a handful of contests, mostly in Maryland. And while the serial
sniper attacks have brought attention to efforts to create a national
system for linking bullets recovered at crime scenes to particular
guns, the NRA and President Bush already have said they oppose the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer voiced skepticism Tuesday
about the need for any new gun controls in response to the sniper
fire. "How many laws can we really have to stop crime, if people are
determined in their heart to violate them no matter how many there
are or what they say?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's stance is not surprising; more noteworthy is
the response by Democrats to the current shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders who three years ago were advocating new gun safety
requirements, strict background checks at gun shows and other
measures are now taking a more cautious approach. That is in part
because Congress is near the end of its session. What's more, no one
yet knows who the sniper is and what, if any, new law would prevent
such a crime in the future.</TE>
<TE>   But the restraint also reflects a broad consensus among Democrats
that they suffered in 2000 -- in losing the presidency and failing to
win control of the House -- largely because the party's embrace of
gun control alienated swing voters in states such as Tennessee,
Arkansas and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   There's a broadly shared belief "that's developed about guns and
the need for the Democratic Party to downplay the issue," said Stuart
Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The political geography of this year's campaign reinforces that
caution. Most of the competitive House and Senate races are in the
South or other states with large rural areas -- places where
supporting gun control is politically risky.</TE>
<TE>   So in Arkansas, Democrat Mark Pryor is campaigning for the Senate
with mailings that note he is a gun owner and hunter; one even
includes a picture of his hunting license.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats worry that their party may have gone overboard,
overestimating the clout of the NRA and jettisoning an issue that has
effectively mobilized many suburban residents to vote Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned the wrong lesson," said one Democratic strategist who
requested anonymity. "We are craven as a party, and pretty stupid."</TE>
<TE>   One of the few Democrats now campaigning on the issue is former
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, the late replacement for the
scandal-tainted Democratic incumbent, Robert Torricelli, in the New
Jersey Senate race. Lautenberg made a recent campaign appearance with
Sarah Brady, the national gun control advocate.</TE>
<TE>   In Maryland, gun control has become a key issue in the
gubernatorial contest between Democratic Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, a gun control proponent whose father and uncle were
assassinated, and GOP Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., who has supported
gun-owner rights as a member of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in the House have shown some political sensitivity to
the issue in the current climate. House GOP leaders last week
canceled a planned vote on legislation, strongly backed by the NRA,
to shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits related to gun violence.</TE>
<TE>   And the decision by House GOP leaders to schedule Tuesday's vote
on the bill to improve background check systems came in response to a
request from Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.), who faces a tough
reelection race and in whose district some of the sniper shootings
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is a rare breed: a measure backed by gun control
advocates, such as Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.), and NRA allies,
like Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). A similar coalition is trying to
win quick Senate passage of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would give states a financial incentive to upgrade
their law enforcement records and automate transmission of the
information to the federal background check system. That database is
used to screen potential gun purchasers to keep the weapons out of
the hands of felons, the mentally incompetent and others who are
banned from owning firearms.</TE>
<TE>   But according to a study by Americans for Gun Safety, the average
state has automated only 58% of its criminal convictions, and an
estimated 10,000 ineligible people were allowed to buy guns over an
18-month period because of faulty records.</TE>
<TE>   Although the push for the bill began months before the sniper
attacks, the shootings provided an emotional underpinning for the
House debate. The shootings, said Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), "seem ...
to say, tauntingly, there is nothing you can do.... We rise today in
this institution to do something."</TE>
<TE>   However, gun control advocates say the bill, which was approved by
voice vote, obtained broad support only because it did so little to
curb the availability of guns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that significant," said Kristen Rand, legislative
director of the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   More controversial is the legislation, languishing in Congress,
that would create a national ballistic "fingerprinting" system to
help trace bullets to the firearm that discharged them.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Tuesday that "it
is time to take a look" at such proposals, although he said it was
unlikely this year.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Fleischer said Bush is opposed to the
fingerprinting proposal because the president believes there are too
many questions about the scientific basis of the technique.</TE>
<TE>   Later on Tuesday, though, perhaps mindful of the administration's
image in the midst of the sniper attacks, the White House said that
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms would study the
feasibility and the technology involved in such a system, as well as
the experiences of Maryland and New York, the only states that
require ballistics data to be kept on guns sold in those states.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, said the group was
not making any public comment on the effect of recent developments on
the gun control debate until the sniping case is solved. "Any and all
focus should be on getting this deranged individual off the streets,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Noelle Bush Hearing to Be Open to Public</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush's daughter cannot have her hearing in drug court closed
to the public, a judge ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge Reginald Whitehead said Florida's drug courts are
criminal proceedings and are open to the public. He weighed the
patient's right to privacy against the public's right to access to
court proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   "Drug court status hearings must be open to all participants so
that all participants can observe each other's successes and
failures," the judge wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Whitehead scheduled a hearing for Thursday to determine if Noelle
Bush, 25, can stay in her drug treatment program or whether she will
be returned to the regular criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Bush had asked the judge to close her drug court
hearing, arguing that the governor's daughter had the right to expect
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   But the Orlando Sentinel and the South Florida Sun-Sentinel argued
that drug courts are no different from criminal courts and subject to
the same openness.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was put in the drug court system after she was accused of
trying to use a forged prescription to buy the anti-anxiety drug
Xanax at a pharmacy drive-through window in January. She has been
undergoing treatment at a rehabilitation center in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was sent to jail for two days in July after center workers
found her with prescription pills. Last month, a caller told Orlando
police that Bush had a piece of crack cocaine in her shoe, but a
judge later ruled that workers at the center cannot be forced to
testify in court about Bush's case.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge had to make that determination. All I can tell you is
it's a lot harder to deal with drug addictions with these big lights,
but it's his court," Bush said at a campaign stop. "The sad fact is,
and the good news is, that frankly, cameras and reporters aren't as
interested in the other people in drug court, so they have some
degree of privacy to be able to cope with their addictions."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said his daughter has not received preferential treatment.
"In fact, as a father my concern is to make sure that she's treated
as she should be treated and people don't go overboard because of who
she is."</TE>
<TE>   He said that, as a father, his daughter's addiction is difficult
to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "I see pictures of her when she was 3 or 4 four years old and I
vividly remember that," Bush said. "But now she's 25 and the laws
apply to her as they apply to anyone else. I just hope the laws apply
to her like anybody else."</TE>

<HD>Coming Medicare Cuts Worry Doctors</HD>
<DH>Elderly patients will be harmed if money is not restored,
new AMA chief tells Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With Medicare scheduled to cut billions of dollars from doctors'
payments, a group representing physicians is urging Congress to
restore the money before elderly patients have trouble finding
doctors.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Congress acts by Nov. 1, "more physicians will be forced to
make the difficult decision to stop taking new Medicare patients into
their practices," Dr. Donald Palmisano, president-elect of the
American Medical Assn., said Tuesday. The next round of cuts, which
take effect Jan. 1, will be announced next month.</LD>
<LD>   Palmisano said doctors already have taken a 5.4% cut and are
facing an additional 12% in cuts, equaling about $11 billion, over
the next three years. At the current rate of cuts and inflation,
Medicare doctor payments in 2005 will be below the 1991 level,
Palmisano said.</LD>
<TE>   He said an AMA survey found that 24% of physicians already have
placed limits on the number of Medicare patients they treat or plan
to institute limits soon.</TE>
<TE>   The reductions are required under a Medicare payment formula that
relies on the state of the economy, which is struggling.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and the Bush administration have said the payment
formula is unfair and have expressed interest in finding a remedy for
doctors. But the White House has balked at lawmakers' plans to send
extra money to hospitals and other health providers as well.</TE>
<TE>   The House included $30 billion for Medicare providers as part of a
prescription drug bill it passed.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate was unable to reach agreement on a prescription drug
bill, but lawmakers have been pushing a separate bill that would send
$43 billion to Medicare providers, including money for health
maintenance organizations, nursing homes and rural hospitals.</TE>

<HD>Proteins May Help Spot Prostate Cancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Researchers say they have found protein markers in a blood test that
can be used to eliminate unneeded biopsies by sharpening the
diagnosis of prostate cancer, the second deadliest form of cancer
among American men.</LD>
<LD>   In a study appearing this week in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, researchers report that they may eventually be able
to determine to a high degree of accuracy if a man has prostate
cancer by testing a pattern of protein traces found in a single drop
of blood.</LD>
<LD>   "With further study, this has the potential to revolutionize the
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer," said Dr. David Ornstein,
a prostate cancer specialist at the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill who co-wrote the study. "This could help significantly
reduce unnecessary biopsies."</LD>
<TE>   Men older than 50 are currently being screened routinely for
prostate abnormalities with a blood test for the prostate specific
antigen, or PSA. In most practices, men with PSA readings between 4
and 10 are routinely biopsied to determine if they have prostate
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, an estimated 70% to 80% of men with abnormal PSAs don't
have cancer but a benign condition that prompts the midrange PSA
reading.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical clinical question in prostate cancer is who should
get biopsies when their PSA is in this intermediate range," said
Emanuel Petricoin, a researcher at the Food and Drug Administration
and the first author of the study. Thousands of men have biopsies
that would not be needed if doctors could determine with high
accuracy from a blood test whether cancer was present, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Using a system that precisely measures a pattern of proteins in
the blood could be that test, Petricoin said.</TE>

Tuesday at the Union Pacific yard in Des Moines to remove as many as
11 badly decomposed bodies of suspected illegal immigrants found in
the locked car near Denison, 60 miles northeast of Omaha. They likely
died from overheating and asphyxiation, authorities said. The victims
apparently boarded the train in Mexico four months ago.</CP>

<HD>Daughter Guilty in Dad's Sword Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEESBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>A former college student was found guilty Tuesday of first-degree
murder for enlisting a friend to kill her scientist father with a
sword.</LD>
<LD>   A Loudoun County Circuit Court jury deliberated four hours before
returning its verdict against Clara Jane Schwartz, 20. Jurors
recommended she spend 48 years in prison. She will be formally
sentenced Jan. 21.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys said they would appeal, arguing that the jury
did not spend enough time going through the evidence.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Schwartz, 57, was found dead in his home Dec. 12. A
prominent biophysicist, he had been stabbed multiple times with a
2-foot-long sword. Police arrested two of Clara Schwartz's friends
and found the murder weapon in one of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz has been in jail since her arrest in February on the
campus of James Madison University, where she was a student.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Owen Basham urged the jury Tuesday to recommend a stiff
sentence. "You've been asked to look at the photographs and look at
the ugly, savage way Dr. Schwartz was killed in his own home," Basham
said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury could have recommended a life sentence for the
convictions, which also included conspiracy to commit murder and two
counts of soliciting a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The defense argued that the man prosecutors say she asked to
commit the crime, Kyle Hulbert, is not mentally stable. They also
argued that Robert Schwartz abused his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Hulbert, 19, of Millersville, Md., wrote in a confession that he
killed Schwartz to protect Clara Schwartz from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to testify last week against his friend, citing his
right to avoid self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Hulbert wasn't the only person Schwartz
asked to kill her father.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick House, a former boyfriend, testified Oct. 8 that he and
Schwartz were the primary characters in an elaborate role-playing
game she invented called Underworld. Clara played the overlord, Lord
Chaos, and House acted as an assassin assigned to kill "Old Guy" --
Clara Schwartz's father.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Schwartz asked House when he really would kill her
father, but he never followed through, he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said the game was only an escape for a girl with
a sad social life.</TE>
<TE>   Hulbert and Michael P. Pfohl, who is accused of driving Hulbert to
the Schwartz house, each is charged with first-degree murder and
conspiracy. Their trials are set for early next year.</TE>

<HD>Latest Victim, a Mother of 2, Had Survived Cancer</HD>
<DH>Linda Franklin, 47, a grandmother-to-be, planned to build
dream house with husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ARLINGTON, Va. -- It was hard to find recent photographs of Linda
Franklin on Tuesday afternoon; they were packed away in boxes along
with everything else. Friday was to be moving day, the first step in
a plan to build a dream house with her husband, Ted, in Washington's
Virginia suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   The move is what took her Monday night to a Home Depot in nearby
Falls Church, where the couple who did pretty much everything
together went to buy a few supplies. While he loaded bags into their
red convertible, she was cut down by a sniper's single bullet, the
11th victim felled in nearly two weeks and the ninth to die.</LD>
<LD>   The diverse demographics of the victims is taking shape as a
chilling portrait of the Washington metropolis -- a cabdriver, a
nanny, a landscaper, an entrepreneur, a schoolboy. Linda Franklin fit
one significant profile, one of the myriad government workers who
labor in the bureaucratic bunkers of Washington and return to the
leafy outskirts that have long been presumed safe.</LD>
<TE>   She had been working for four years as an intelligence operations
specialist in the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, a
joint government and private-sector office charged with protecting
U.S. computer networks and the Internet from cyber-attack, espionage
and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   She loved her work, her husband, her children -- a son, 25, and a
daughter, 23. She spent weekends snowboarding with her family or
tubing down a river. She was crazy about her pets -- two cats and two
mutts. And though she hardly looked the part of a grandmother, her
daughter was about to make her one, a friend said.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved her. She was fun, vivacious, very active. She was loving
and giving," said Peggy Hulseberg, whose husband, Paul, worked with
Franklin. "When we first moved here from Oklahoma, she was one of the
first friends I made. She made you feel so comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin had survived a recent battle with breast cancer. At 47,
she appeared the picture of health -- blond hair, bright smile,
making an already senseless death seem all the more tragic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible to have survived that, only to end up dying this
way," said an unnamed official at the FBI. "It's not right."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Tuesday, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III said the entire bureau mourned her death. "Tragically, a member
of the FBI family last night became the latest victim of the
Washington, D.C.-area sniper killer," Mueller said. "Linda was a
dedicated employee, and she will be missed.... The employees who
worked with Linda -- and all of us -- are deeply shocked and angry
over this tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin and her husband, a computer network engineer, were
planning to build a home, but in the region's explosive housing
market, their two-story condominium sold more quickly than they had
expected and they were in the process of moving to temporary
quarters. Ted Franklin was next to his wife when she was struck and
threw his body over hers.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, friends and family filed into the butter-colored
condominium with the blue door in a community where the neighbors
don't always know each other but the streets are clean and safe.</TE>
<TE>   "The family is devastated by this tragic event ... shocked by this
senseless loss of life," said Bill Murray, who works for the FBI
division that Franklin served and was acting as a family spokesman to
the media clot that formed across the street, waiting to learn more
about her.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin's death brought fear to yet another sector of
Washington's suburbs, where schoolchildren are no longer allowed to
play outside and residents have adjusted their patterns of life.
Lately, people duck as they pump gas, shorten the daily walk with the
dog, anything to avoid a killer who strikes where life is ordinary
and unguarded.</TE>
<TE>   One official said that even FBI agents were altering their daily
routines. "You almost have to duck and weave even just to go shopping
or walk through a public area," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   On the street where Franklin lived, residents stood in their front
yards and stared.</TE>
<TE>   "I just moved here from Boston and I want to go back," 18-year-old
Courtney Prowse said, crying. "This is just crazy. It's scary to go
to the grocery store. I'm afraid to walk from my car to the house."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was a graduate of the University of Florida and spent
much of her childhood and early adulthood in Gainesville, Fla. Her
father, Charles W. Moore, said his daughter had taught students at
military high schools for the Department of Defense and had traveled
to other countries before joining the FBI. He was too overcome to say
anything more.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Home Depot on Tuesday, a line of officers scoured the
covered parking deck on hands and knees for evidence, and a truck
towed away Linda Franklin's red car.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES/ WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Black Won't Try for Indian Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel pitching coach Bud Black said Tuesday that he has withdrawn
from consideration for the Cleveland Indians' managerial vacancy.</LD>
<LD>   "The timing is just not right," Black said.</LD>
<LD>   With a home in the San Diego area and daughters aged 15 and 10,
Black said that he did not believe pursuing a job so far from home
was appropriate at this time. Black said he had not been contacted
about any other managerial vacancies, although the Seattle Mariners'
job just opened, and that he planned to return to the Angels next
season.</LD>
<TE>   "As of right now, yes," he said. "I'm going to leave the door open
for the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel coaches all are working on one-year contracts. Although
General Manager Bill Stoneman has said all coaches will be invited to
return next season, he has deferred contract negotiations until the
end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Black, who worked for the Indians before joining the Angels,
informed Cleveland General Manager Mark Shapiro of his decision in a
telephone call Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, both because I think he has great potential to
impact our organization and because of my personal and professional
relationship with him," Shapiro said. "But I certainly understand his
values, and that only enhances my respect for him as a human being."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will lose two of their hottest hitters when the World
Series shifts to San Francisco's Pacific Bell Park for the third,
fourth and, if necessary, fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   With National League rules in force, the Angels will play without
designated hitters Brad Fullmer and Shawn Wooten. Although Fullmer
started six games at first base during interleague play, Manager Mike
Scioscia said first baseman Scott Spiezio, the superior defensive
player, will start throughout the World Series. Wooten, who also can
play first base, is hitting .471 in postseason play. Spiezio is
hitting .375, Fullmer .316.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants aren't yet sure who their designated hitter will be for
games at Edison Field, although they might use Barry Bonds at DH
against right-hander Kevin Appier and use Tom Goodwin in the
outfield.</TE>
<TE>   Ace Jarrod Washburn will start Game 1 Saturday, with Appier, Ramon
Ortiz and John Lackey expected to follow in that order. The Angels
made no changes in their playoff roster for the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Giants dumped reliever Ben Weber two years ago, and the Angels
claimed him on waivers. But rather than hold any animosity toward the
Giants, Weber is grateful to them.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the Giants, I wouldn't be here today," Weber
said.</TE>
<TE>   After a nine-year odyssey that included playing in an independent
league and in Taiwan, Weber, 32, made his major league debut for the
Giants in 2000. In nine games, he posted a 14.63 earned-run average,
and he did not return. But one of minor league managers with the
Giants was Ron Roenicke. After Scioscia hired him as a coach with the
Angels, Roenicke recommended to Stoneman that the Angels acquire
Weber.</TE>

<HD>Danger Zone</HD>
<DH>Pitching to Bonds presents a challenge to Anaheim staff</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball works in strange ways, especially in October. If Adam
Kennedy was the unlikely hero of the American League championship
series, how about Scott Schoeneweis as the unlikely hero of the World
Series?</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy bats ninth for the Angels, if he starts at all. He hit
seven home runs in the regular season. But he hit three in the
victory that propelled the Angels into their first World Series, the
Hall of Fame called for his bat, and he emerged a star for the ages.</LD>
<LD>   Still, when Kennedy plays, he plays nine innings. When Schoeneweis
appears, he throws three or four pitches, then disappears. In
baseball, heroes do not wear No. 60.</LD>
<TE>   But, as the Angels and San Francisco Giants prepare to open the
World Series on Saturday at Edison Field, those three or four pitches
Schoeneweis throws could well determine the outcome of a game. As the
Angels' lone left-handed reliever, Schoeneweis is the antidote to
Barry Bonds, a trump card available for Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
to play once -- and only once -- a game.</TE>
<TE>   Few pitchers handle this difficult chore so well. In seven at-bats
against Schoeneweis, Bonds has one hit, a single. No home runs. No
walks. Four strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   If Schoeneweis retires Bonds and the Angels win, Schoeneweis does
not figure to account for the other 26 outs necessary for victory.
The spotlight amuses him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like, if I get Bonds out every game and we win the World
Series, they'll vote me the World Series MVP," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no other player capable of the destruction that Bonds can
wreak. In the National League, most teams simply wave a white flag
and walk him, but Angel closer Troy Percival is not stocking up on
white flags.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been scared of anything all season long," Percival
said. "I don't see us being scared of Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of teams we play have superstars on them. I throw quality
pitches and attack those hitters."</TE>
<TE>   There is a time for bravado and a time for restraint, and
Percival's track record suggests he is well aware of the difference.
He has faced Bonds four times, retiring him once and walking him
three times.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm on the mound, we're going after him," Percival said. "If
I've got an open base, he's not seeing anything to hit. If there's
nobody on, he's going to have to beat me."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds set a major league record last season by hitting 73 home
runs. He set two more records this season, with 198 walks and 68
intentional walks. When he reached base on an intentional walk, he
scored only three times.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching National League games, the unwillingness of opposing
clubs to pitch to the guy leads me to believe it's the thing to do,"
Angel pitching coach Bud Black said. "They all seem to do the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   And they are all home for the winter. Perhaps the conventional
wisdom isn't all that wise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go after him," Angel reliever Ben Weber said. "Why
wouldn't you, if it's only going to cost you a run? He can't hit a
home run every time, can he?"</TE>
<TE>   The best hitters make an out, after all, seven out of 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   "With him, six of 10," said Angel ace Jarrod Washburn, the Game 1
starter. "I like my chances. But I'm sure a lot of guys have said
that and lost."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to minimize their risk. If the Giants have runners
on second and third base, the Angels intend to walk Bonds. If no one
is on base, they do not appear inclined to walk him.</TE>
<TE>   In the National League championship series, St. Louis Manager Tony
La Russa ordered Bonds walked with two out and none on, an order
Scioscia is unlikely to issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you rule anything out," Scioscia said. "He's a
special player. It's not just like he's a good hitter you pitch
around. You have to respect that, and we will.</TE>
<TE>   "But it doesn't mean you have a blanket policy of rolling balls
four feet outside every time he comes up."</TE>
<TE>   Said Schoeneweis: "There are situations where you pitch around
hitters of his caliber. The situation will dictate. But I don't think
we'll be doing the crazy stuff I've seen done, like Buck Showalter
walking him with the bases loaded."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel pitchers embrace the challenge of pitching to Bonds,
with the appropriate disclaimer.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to pitch to him, but I want a World Series ring too,"
Washburn said. "If winning a ring means I have to pitch around him,
so be it."</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of phenom Francisco Rodriguez offers Scioscia
another option for countering Bonds in the innings before Percival.
Scioscia could ask either Rodriguez or Schoeneweis to retire Bonds in
the eighth inning, or he could use one against Bonds in the sixth
inning and the other in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal feeling is that I would like to pitch to him,"
Schoeneweis said. "If he beats you, he beats you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like pitching to a modern-day Ted Williams, or Babe Ruth."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis started against the Giants last year. He struck out
Bonds three times, but he does not imagine Bonds will stay awake this
week, worrying about facing him.</TE>
<TE>   Said Schoeneweis: "I'm sure he doesn't even know to pronounce my
name."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Piniella's Next Stop Could Be New York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lou Piniella may not be out of work very long.</LD>
<LD>   After releasing Piniella from the final year of his contract
because he wants to work closer to home, the Seattle Mariners on
Tuesday fielded calls from other teams interested in talking with
their former manager.</LD>
<LD>   If he really wants a short commute from his Florida home, the
Tampa Bay job is open. However, it's unlikely the budget-conscious
Devil Rays would be able to pay him enough or compensate the Mariners
enough for letting him manage elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Mets, however, are another story.</TE>
<TE>   Although the team owes former Manager Bobby Valentine $2.7 million
for the final year of his contract, owner Fred Wilpon wants a
high-profile individual with a background as a winner as the next
bench boss.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella fits that profile, managing Cincinnati to the World
Series title in 1990 and Seattle to a record 116 victories in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He also has New York roots, with two terms as manager of the
Yankees, a team he played with for 11 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella won't come cheap. He was due to make $2.5 million with
the Mariners next season and would probably want at least three years
at $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Gibson returned to the Detroit Tigers, joining Manager Alan
Trammell's staff as a bench coach on one of the teams he led to a
World Series title.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, who also helped the Dodgers win the 1988 World Series,
signed a three-year deal with the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers also have hired former Detroit catcher Lance Parrish as
bullpen coach and retained Juan Samuel as a third base coach. Both
signed two-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago White Sox invoked a contract clause that drastically
reduces Frank Thomas' salary, clearing the way for the two-time MVP
to become a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox sent Thomas a letter Oct. 6 saying they were
invoking a "diminished skills" clause in his contract, a lawyer with
knowledge of the talks said on condition of anonymity. That clause
would reduce his base pay to $250,000, and defer most of his nearly
$10-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Blue Jays hired Tony LaCava, an Angel scout from 1989
to 1999, as an assistant general manager.... The Milwaukee Brewers
interviewed Cecil Cooper, the team's bench coach this season, for
their vacant managerial position. Arizona Diamondback coach Bob
Melvin and Yankee coach Willie Randolph also have been interviewed.</TE>

<LD>Michelle Kaufman, commenting in the Miami Herald on
now-health-conscious Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley:</LD>
<LD>   "He craved cigarettes only during the season.</LD>
<LD>   "Before practice. After practice. During games. After games. Then
there were the rum and Cokes, the chocolate bars, cookies, heavy
pasta meals.</LD>
<TE>   "Exercise? Who had time?</TE>
<TE>   "Riley might have looked like a healthy NBA coach two years ago,
but he didn't always feel like it....</TE>
<TE>   " 'Two years ago, I quit all the bad things -- well, most of them,
anyway. I feel much better.'</TE>
<TE>   "Riley's diet -- breakfast: Oatmeal with raisins, berries, egg
whites. Lunch: Salads and fruit. Dinner: Chicken, fish. Sleep habits:
Midnight to 5 a.m. Exercises: One hour a day [Stairmaster,
weightlifting]."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds UCLA's game record for yards passing?</TE>
<TE>   Ganging up: Nick Peters in the Sacramento Bee: "Perhaps it's a
good omen, but J.T. Snow and Benito Santiago have been thriving in
the playoffs ever since they began challenging Barry Bonds to home
run contests during batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Why two against one? 'Because he's got 600 homers and we've got
about 300,' Snow said. [Actually, it's 613-365]."</TE>
<TE>   Impostor? Jim Reeves of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, on Dallas
Cowboy Coach Dave Campo: "Grab your popcorn and soda because the
current feature at Valley River Ranch stars a defensive coordinator
named Dave being asked to impersonate a head coach in the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Remember? Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "The Angels are
riding high now and it's time to forget all the sad stuff and
remember how they made us laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "How, when Gene Autry introduced Bill Rigney as the team's first
manager, he said he tried to get Casey Stengel, but had ended up with

<TE>   In the dark: Tony Kornheiser on ESPN: "Going into the playoffs, I

Della Reese and Roma Downey."</TE>
<TE>   Greeting impairment: Philadelphia 76er star Allen Iverson scored
28 points in an exhibition game Sunday, despite having recently
broken the middle finger on his shooting hand.</TE>
<TE>   Zack Tyler of KSJO-FM in San Jose, however, fears the injury "will
affect his ability to greet reporters."</TE>
<TE>   Just wondering: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "A
55-yard Denver field goal with 45 seconds left is trumped by a
53-yard Miami field goal with six seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it's Denver. Should those footballs be stored in a
humidor?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Cade McNown, 513, against Miami in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "On Friday, ESPN credited itself for the scoop on
Buck Showalter taking the Texas job," said Phil Mushnick of the New
York Post. "Mazel tov! Showalter, after all, until he accepted the

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Buck Won't Stop Here</HD>
<DH>Versatile Fox announcer will call the World Series and
Super Bowl</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Buck, tabbed "Mr. October" by Fox, is at a point in sports
broadcasting one can only dream about. Not only has he replaced Pat
Summerall as Fox's lead play-by-play announcer on the NFL, he'll call
his fifth World Series for Fox beginning Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In January 2005, he'll call Super Bowl XXXIX at Jacksonville, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   That will put him in a class with announcers such as Curt Gowdy
and Al Michaels, who have worked a World Series and a Super Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Not bad for someone only 33.</TE>
<TE>   The first time Buck was in a broadcast booth was not so glamorous.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember sitting in the back of the booth at Busch Stadium,"
Buck said after flying home to St. Louis from San Francisco on
Tuesday. "I was maybe 4, I'm not sure. It's the earliest memory of my
life, the earliest memory I have of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Young Joe Buck was there because he had accompanied his father,
the legendary Jack Buck, to work.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching my dad and Mike Shannon call the game," Buck said.
"I remember crawling around on a table and I knocked over a coke. It
spilled all over my dad and Mike and the engineer and they all turned
and glared. Someone yelled, 'What the heck?' Or something like that.
And I started to cry.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess if that experience wasn't going to steer me away from
sports broadcasting, nothing was."</TE>
<TE>   Buck, who studied broadcasting at Indiana, was announcing games
for the triple-A Louisville Redbirds during summer vacations when he
was 19.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 22, during his senior year of college, he got
an offer from the St. Louis Cardinals. The offer was too good to pass
up. He quit college with one semester left.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 25, he was working for Fox. But his dad didn't
get him the job. His mom did.</TE>
<TE>   Carole Buck, Jack Buck's second wife and Joe's mother, ran across
Patti Goren at the 1994 Super Bowl in Atlanta. Patti's husband, Ed,
had just left CBS to become the No. 2 man at Fox Sports, which was
going to begin televising NFL games the following season.</TE>
<TE>   Carole told Goren about Joe and asked her to show a tape of his
work to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Jack would have done what Carole did," said Ed
Goren. "Knowing him, he would have thought he was imposing. Only a
mother would do that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Joe Buck: "Clearly, my mother has been my best agent."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Goren, now president of Fox Sports, or
David Hill, chairman of Fox Sports, to recognize they had a star on
their hands. By 1996, Buck, at 27, was Fox's lead man on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McCarver, Buck's partner on baseball, puts him in a class with
Michaels and others regarded as the best in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "A play-by-play announcer tells the viewer what and where,"
McCarver said. "An analyst explains why and how. Joe can do all
four."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas, another network announcer who calls St. Louis home,
believes he knows the secret to Buck's success.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a tremendous teacher in his father," Costas said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Gowdy and Michaels, few announcers have announced the
World Series and the Super Bowl to a national audience. Jack Buck was
one of them, although mostly on radio.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck is indeed going to be joining an elite club.</TE>
<TE>   "As a kid I dreamed of being a professional baseball player," he
said. "When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I dreamed of
being a broadcaster. I saw first-hand the kind of life my dad led,
and I wanted that kind of life."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Buck, who wore many hats in broadcasting, was a Cardinal
announcer from 1954 until illness kept him out of the booth this
season. He died in June at 77. He left six children -- four from his
first marriage and two from his second. Joe has a 30-year-old sister.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Buck was a humble man, kind to everyone. Joe Buck is the
same.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has ever gone to his head," McCarver said. "He hasn't
even taken a first step in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weisman, the former executive producer at NBC Sports who
is now Fox's coordinating producer of baseball, has worked with many
of the biggest names in sports broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of his age and the opportunities in front of him, I think
when it's all said and done he will have worked more big events than
anyone," Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   Weisman, who heads up the crew that includes Buck and McCarver and
will be working the World Series, says Buck is just one of the guys.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows the names of more of the guys on the crew than I do,"
Weisman said. "He stays in the same hotels as the crew, travels to
the games in the same cars."</TE>
<TE>   A high point from a television standpoint during the National
League championship series came Monday night, after the San Francisco
Giants had eliminated the Cardinals. Fox paid tribute to Jack Buck
and Cardinal pitcher Darryl Kile, who died the same week. It was a
moving tribute, one Buck handled with class.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew they had footage of my father skydiving, but I purposely
didn't look at it beforehand," Buck said. "I wanted to see it the
same time as everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Buck is looking forward to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope it is a long, exciting series," Buck said. "If that
is the case, it will sell itself to the country."</TE>

<HD>USC in Red, UCLA Is Even</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Gary Klein and Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expenses incurred by the USC athletic department last year outpaced
revenues by more than $4 million, according to a report that all
universities were required to submit Tuesday with the Department of
Education as part of Title IX compliance.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA balanced its athletics budget for the eighth year in a row, a
streak that began the year the school cut men's swimming and men's
gymnastics.</LD>
<LD>   USC, however, was in the red for the third year in a row. Last
year the shortfall was $2 million. Administrators said the disparity
was attributed to several factors, including an increase in football
coaching salaries and buyouts, fewer football season ticket sales and
fewer national television appearances.</LD>
<TE>   Appearances in bowl games other than bowl championship series
games are break-even propositions for most schools. The Trojans
played in the Las Vegas Bowl last December.</TE>
<TE>   USC football generated nearly $20 million in revenue on expenses
of just over $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   Men's basketball generated $3.1 million on expenses of $2.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Other men's teams spent $4.4 million and generated about $710,000.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA football generated about $17 million in revenue on expenses
of $9.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Men's basketball generated $8 million on expenses of $3.8 million.
Other men's sports spent $4 million and generated $874,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $8 million was spent on USC women's programs that generated
only $772,322. UCLA women's teams generated $772,398 on expenses of
$8.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   USC expects the shortfall to end this year.</TE>
<TE>   Two games already have been telecast by ABC, and at least four
others are scheduled to be. Also, about 800 more season tickets were
sold and there are 12 games instead of 11.</TE>
<TE>   The primary purpose of the report, which is required by the Equity
in Athletics Disclosure Act of 1994, is to determine whether colleges
are making progress toward complying with gender equity laws.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is for athletics to mirror the gender makeup of the
student body.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2001-02 school year, USC's undergraduate student population
of 16,037 was 50.2% male. There were 325 male athletes (52.1%) and
295 female athletes (47.9%).</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, 55% of the 25,303 undergraduates were women, but only
49.9% of the 702 athletes are women.</TE>

<HD>Free-Agent Forward Is a Man on Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can the Clippers cut their leading scorer in exhibition play? Or will
they find a place on the regular-season roster for free-agent forward
Mike Batiste, who has averaged 20.1 points on 30-for-61 shooting
(49.2%) in the first four exhibitions?</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers have 13 players with guaranteed contracts and it
could climb to 14 if the Dallas Mavericks' don't match the offer
sheet signed by center Wang Zhizhi by Thursday's deadline.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't seem likely the Clippers would carry 15 guaranteed
contracts, but it also seems improbable the team would release a
player with the offensive skills of the 6-foot-8 Batiste.</LD>
<TE>   "I think I'm earning my teammates' respect," said Batiste, from
Long Beach Wilson High and Arizona State. "Who knows what [the
team's] decision is going to be? All I can do is play hard. It's a
long shot, but good things come to those who work hard and stay
committed."</TE>
<TE>   Batiste, 24, will get another chance to prove his worth when the
Clippers begin a three-exhibition trip tonight against the Bucks in
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries to key players, Coach Alvin Gentry has given
Batiste plenty of playing time. So far, Gentry has liked what he's
seen from Batiste, who played the last two seasons in Europe before
joining the Clippers' summer league team at Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   "He's played well, obviously," Gentry said. "We've stuck him out
there and he's come through. He wouldn't be playing as much as he has
if we didn't have the injuries. The one thing he's done is step up,
but it doesn't matter what the situation is, he's had a heck of a
camp. You can't have too many good shooters. There are four more
games to play and a lot of practices before we have to line up and
play for real."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, 3-1 in exhibition play, open the regular season Oct.
30 against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Staples Center.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami Athletic Director Paul Dee apologized to Florida State kicker
Xavier Beitia on Tuesday for taunting he received after missing a
possible game-winning field goal on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   After Beitia's 43-yard attempt, which sailed wide left and allowed
the top-ranked Hurricanes to escape with a 28-27 victory, a man in
Miami apparel ran onto the field from the sideline and was
photographed taunting the distraught kicker.</LD>
<LD>   "The person in the picture is a former student volunteer with the
athletic program," Dee said in a statement. "The actions captured in
the picture are unacceptable and show a complete lack of discretion."</LD>
<TE>   The man in the photo was not identified by the school.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska quarterback Jammal Lord will start Saturday at Oklahoma
State despite being charged with disturbing the peace. Coach Frank
Solich said that Lord would be disciplined but that the misdemeanor
ticket did not warrant a suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska volleyball and basketball player Greichaly Cepero, the
2000 American Volleyball Coaches Assn. Division I player of the year
who was at Lord's apartment when police were called to it around 3
a.m. Sunday, was cited with disturbing the peace and failure to obey
a police order.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Solich, volleyball coach John Cook  announced his
disciplinary decision, saying that Cepero would not play tonight
against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we are learning lessons that have nothing to do with
winning and losing," Cook said. "This is about being responsible and
upholding the values of Nebraska volleyball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to replace the natural turf at Michigan Stadium
with an artificial surface before the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Natural turf has been in place since 1991, but problems
maintaining it have increased in recent years. After Saturday's game
against Penn State, the field was pockmarked with divots.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the root system has deteriorated from six inches to
three-quarters-of-an-inch in the past 10 weeks after a hot, dry
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan Stadium had an artificial surface from 1969-90.</TE>

<TE>   Florida quarterback Rex Grossman has a sprained right knee but
should be available for Saturday's game against Auburn....
Mississippi State quarterback Kevin Fant, who sprained his ankle last
week, is expected to play against Memphis.... Brigham Young Coach
Gary Crowton has benched quarterback Bret Engemann and named redshirt
freshman Matt Berry as starter against Nevada Las Vegas.... Air Force
halfback Anthony Butler, who has an injured left ankle, is
questionable for Saturday's game against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Musa Smith, Georgia's leading rusher, has a neck injury, the
seriousness of which has yet to be determined. Smith left last
Saturday's game against Tennessee with brief numbness in his arms and
has been examined by a neurosurgeon and orthopedic surgeon. His
status for Saturday's game against Vanderbilt is questionable. ....
Northwestern quarterback Brett Basanez is likely out until Oct. 26
after breaking his fibula last Thursday at Minnesota. Tony Stauss is
expected to start against No. 20 Penn State.... Southern Mississippi
offensive tackle Jeremy Bridges was suspended for Saturday's game
against Cincinnati for an undisclosed violation of team rules, Golden
Eagle Coach Jeff Bower said.</TE>
<TE>   Backup linebacker Fred Pagac Jr. has been suspended for Ohio
State's game against Wisconsin. The junior was arrested and charged
with persistent disorderly conduct when police said they found him
trying to fight outside a bar near campus early Sunday morning....

<LD>   What: "Out By a Step: The 100 Best Players Not in the Baseball
Hall of Fame"</LD>
<TE>   Authors: Mike Shalin and Neil Shalin</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Diamond Communications</TE>
<TE>   Price: $26.95</TE>
<TE>   Written with the touch of a couple of bleacher bums, "Out By a
Step" is an attempt by two brothers to turn the arguments of who
belongs in Cooperstown into a light-hearted look at the snubbed, the
forgotten, the ballplayers who had above-average careers, but who
probably won't see their bronzed likenesses next to the Babe's.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Mike and Neil Shalin take the arguments out of
statistics-heavy formulas and resort to the basic question of
baseball: Could he play?</TE>
<TE>   In the case of this collection, the answer is a resounding yes.
The Shalins do a fine job of briefly describing the contributions
each player made to the game, but they write more like fans than
historians. Does anyone else really believe Larry Bowa should be
joining Honus Wagner anytime soon?</TE>
<TE>   The book presents some players with numbers that merit Cooperstown
consideration, such as Bert Blyleven, who had 287 victories in his
career and 3,701 strikeouts, much of it with the dreadful Minnesota
Twins of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The book also mentions players who have been overlooked for a
generation, such as New York Giant shortstop Alvin Dark, whose
offensive numbers are nearly identical to those of his famous
contemporary, Dodger Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese, and are superior to
those of Yankee Hall of Famer Phil Rizzuto.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Shalins have written an entertaining book for
the casual fan and thrown a reminder to mathematically obsessed
baseball historians that just because some guys didn't have
exceptional statistics, it doesn't mean they couldn't play.</TE>

<HD>Snow Saw Angels' Potential All Along</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The Angel bandwagon is lumbering along, worn down by
the weight of all those who have hopped aboard in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   But San Francisco Giant first baseman J.T. Snow remembers when he
was among the few people on board.</LD>
<LD>   Snow, a former Angel, became a believer in his old club in spring
training, when the Giants and Angels met three times, the Angels
winning all three, 6-3, 11-10 and 13-3.</LD>
<TE>   "If that team keeps hitting like this," predicted Snow at the
time, "they will win the AL West. They are a good-looking team that
plays the right way."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so he was wrong. The Angels didn't win the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone on the Giants believes an All-California World Series
is the ideal matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to have played the New York Yankees," said
Giant owner Peter Magowan, "to get back at them for what they did to
us 40 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about holding a grudge. The Yankees beat the Giants in the
seventh game of the 1962 World Series, 1-0, when Willie McCovey's
two-out line drive in the ninth inning was caught by second baseman
Bobby Richardson with the potential tying and winning runs in scoring
position.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whenever a memorable moment occurs in sports, someone, it seems,
steps forward to say it was predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, after San Francisco center fielder Kenny Lofton lined
the pennant-winning single into right field Monday night to score
David Bell and give the Giants a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League championship series,
Lofton revealed winning pitcher Tim Worrell was the seer.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim pulled me aside in the dugout before the start of that
inning," Lofton said, "and told me, 'You are going to win this game.'
I said, 'All right.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among those with at least five at-bats, Bell is the Giants'
leading hitter in the postseason at .303 for the 10 games of the
first two series.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds and Rich Aurilia are the team's postseason leaders in
home runs with four each, and Aurilia is the top RBI man with 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation between St. Louis pitcher Garrett Stephenson and
a fan outside Pacific Bell Park after Game 4, at first reported as a
shoving match, may have included a punch by the Cardinal pitcher,
according to a police report.</TE>
<TE>   The fan, 35-year-old David Richardson of South San Francisco, was
allegedly using abusive language and banging on the side of a bus
containing players and family members.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson got off the bus and allegedly threw a punch, a charge
denied by other members of the Cardinal organization.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was offered the opportunity by police to make a
citizen's arrest, decided against it, then changed his mind after the
bus pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   The case has gone to the district attorney's office, where
misdemeanor charges could be filed.</TE>

<KH>CITY SECTION FOOTBALL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Franklin's Big Talent in Small Package</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The memory of his first start for Franklin's varsity football team
remains fresh for Narciso Diaz.</LD>
<LD>   "It was nerve-racking all that week," said Diaz, the Panthers'
prolific senior quarterback. "I had to start the playoff game because
Danny Gonzalez got hurt. At school, I was so nervous that I even
threw up a couple of times."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for Diaz and Franklin, that uneasy feeling carried
over to the game. His first pass was intercepted and the Panthers
went on to lose, 14-7, to Canoga Park in the opening round of the
City Section Invitational playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   A sophomore then, Diaz has come a long way. While leading Franklin
to a 4-1 record this season, he has completed 61% of his passes for
1,667 yards and 16 touchdowns. Only five of his attempts have been
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is the latest talented player for Coach Armando Gonzalez, one
of the City Section's top offensive minds. In 17 years at Franklin,
Gonzalez has coached 13 All-City quarterbacks and continues to be one
of the few committed to the passing game.</TE>
<TE>   Those signal-callers -- Santiago Alvarez, Ronnie Lopez, Jeff Deno,
Erik Garcia and Daniel Gonzalez, to name a few -- have helped create
an assembly line of sorts. But Armando Gonzalez's production line
often doesn't get the recognition of Newhall Hart's or, in recent
years, Woodland Hills Taft's for a couple of reasons:</TE>
<TE>   "They're not 6 feet 2 or 6-3 like Kyle Boller or Kyle Matter and
they haven't gone to big Division I programs," Armando Gonzalez said,
referring to two former Hart quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Herringtons [brothers Mike and Dean] do a great job over
there and have coached some quality kids. But he gets kids that are
your typical college-type kid already."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin doesn't have a 6-5 quarterback coming in (or in these
days transferring in) year after year. All of the Panthers' players
come from the lower middle-class neighborhood around the school and
most are undersized, at least in the eyes of college recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   That includes, Diaz, who's 5-11, 178 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the recruiting aspect," Gonzalez said. "Head coaches
tell their guys, 'Don't bring me no 5-10 quarterback.' "</TE>
<TE>   It is a point of pride for the coach: developing quarterbacks who
often come in as freshmen with little or no experience at the
position. College potential or not, Gonzalez tries to give his
players the best experience they can get in high school. He routinely
schedules summer passing-league games and tries to get his top
players into camps.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Diaz participated in the Nike Camp at USC with wide
receiver and teammate Brandon Powers. The camp featured most of the
top Southern California football recruits for the Class of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to do my best and I think I did all right," Diaz
said. "It was pure competition, especially when there's guys like
[Huntington Beach Edison's] Tommy Grady there."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is on pace to surpass 3,000 passing yards this season and
reach 6,000 for his career. Gonzalez said the keys to his
quarterback's success are his strong arm and wrist and quick release.</TE>
<TE>   While that will probably earn Diaz a stop at a community college
or Division II university, that won't deter him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll just have to prove myself there."</TE>

<TE>   Bobby Mesa had yet to make a victory speech since taking over as
head coach at Van Nuys last year. In fact, the Wolves hadn't won a
game since beating Reseda in the final week of the 2000 regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   As Van Nuys saw its 17-point halftime lead over host Canoga Park
being whittled to three late in the fourth quarter on Friday, panic
nearly set in on the visitors' sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they got nervous," Mesa said. "You're afraid you're
never going to get that win."</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys held on for a 17-14 victory, ending a 14-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   "The smiles on their faces meant everything to me," Mesa said of
his players. "They were just dying for a win so bad. I was especially
happy for those kids who stuck with me and believed in the system."</TE>
<TE>   Many around school were well aware of the streak. Mesa said a
couple of teachers had made disparaging remarks about his team but he
also said the school's administration has been behind him all the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Some views were changed Friday night. This time, the bus ride home
was a jubilant one.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the band members came up to me and said, 'Coach, that's
great that you won,' " Mesa said. "A couple of cheerleaders even had
tears in their eyes on the bus. All kids need to have success."</TE>

<TE>   With league play beginning in earnest this week, a review of
intersectional games played this season shows less-than-glowing City
Section results.</TE>
<TE>   City teams went 10-41-1 against those from other sections.
Matchups between the top teams in the City and Southern sections were
mostly competitive with Dorsey, Carson and Lake Balboa Birmingham
putting major scares into Santa Margarita, Los Alamitos and Hart,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got them ready to play now," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes
said of Carson Coach John Aguirre after the Griffins' 34-26 victory
Friday night. "They're going to be a major factor in the City when
it's all said and done."</TE>
<TE>   Hart Coach Mike Herrington had similar things to say about
Birmingham after the Indians' 27-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "[Coach Ed Croson's] team is very talented and they're very
well-coached," Herrington said. "They did some things that really
bothered us. They can win the City title."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (5-0); 2. Fremont (5-0); 3. Birmingham (3-2);
4. Carson (3-2); 5. San Pedro (3-2); 6. Venice (4-1); 7. Roosevelt
(4-1); 8. Banning (2-3); 9. Crenshaw (2-3); 10. Gardena (3-2).</TE>

<HD>Valencia Players Arrested in Fight</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Valencia High running back Charles Burnley, one of the top college
prospects in California, and teammate Desmond Blair were arrested on
suspicion of battery last Friday and suspended from school for five
days because they took part in a lunchtime fight on Thursday, school
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Burnley and Blair were involved in a fight that left a Valencia
junior with facial injuries that required medical attention.</LD>
<LD>   Burnley missed the 56-6 victory over West Hills Chaminade last
Friday but is expected to play in a Foothill League opener at Canyon
Country Canyon on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   School policy mandates an automatic five-day suspension for
fighting. The actual day of the fight counts as the first day of the
suspension. Burnley and Blair will be back at school on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an immature thing to do," Coach Brian Stiman said. "It was
a silly high school fight."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Don Wyman of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station would
not reveal any names but confirmed that two football players were
arrested last Friday. He said the court date for both was set for
Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Burnley, a 6-foot, 170-pounder who also plays outside linebacker,
has 649 yards rushing and eight touchdowns in four games for Valencia
(3-2).</TE>
<TE>   Blair has not played since Sept. 27 because of a broken collarbone
and is not expected back for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>

<TE>   Wesley Washington, a guard at Santa Ana Mater Dei, has committed
to Minnesota, Monarch assistant coach Chris Nordstrom said.
Washington, a Times' All-Star last season, had committed to
California in the spring, but withdrew his commitment when school
officials informed him that he might not be academically qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Marino has forfeited its football victory over Rosemead on
Oct. 4 because a suspended assistant coach was present at its game,
said Thom Simmons, Southern Section spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive coordinator Bill Maloney was found to be in violation of
section rules after it was discovered he had been in communication
with another assistant via headphones while watching the game from
outside the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Maloney and another assistant coach, Brian Dennis, had been
ejected after a 17-13 loss to Burbank a week earlier, according to
San Marino Principal Loren Kleinrock.</TE>
<TE>   By rule, the two coaches were not allowed to attend the team's
next game.</TE>
<TE>   Kleinrock suspended Coach Rich Enright and Maloney for last week's
game against San Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   Kleinrock coached the team, which lost, 20-13.</TE>
<TE>   "Right or wrong, they were ejected and made a very poor choice on
how to deal with it," Kleinrock said.</TE>
<TE>   San Marino is now 2-3 and Rosemead is 1-4.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After two weeks of the Oak Tree meet, Jack Carava leads trainers with
six victories, one more than Bob Baffert, Richard Mandella and Doug
O'Neill.</LD>
<LD>   Carava has a chance to fatten his advantage today.</LD>
<LD>   He has runners in five of the eight races and all five have to be
considered contenders.</LD>
<TE>   In the opener, he will send out likely favorite Girl Talk. A
5-year-old Lil Tyler mare, she has won her last two and the
anticipated quick pace should set things up for her from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Like Girl Talk, Disguys Dalimit arrives on a two-race roll and
figures to be favored in the second against six other $10,000
claimers. A winner of 10 of 31 lifetime, the 7-year-old has won four
of 11 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Claimed by Carava for $40,000 more than two months ago at Del Mar,
Snoopy Cat is back in for that price today against six other
3-year-olds in the third, the first leg of the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   Biker's Sis, who was claimed by Carava for $16,000 at Del Mar,
should be helped by a fast pace in the fifth, and Its Always Busy
seeks his first win in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Endless Summer, a Group II winner in England,
makes his first start since July 18 for Bobby Frankel in the seventh
at Santa Anita, a $50,000 optional claimer at about 6 1/2 furlongs on
the turf. Among his seven opponents are Bills Paid, Music's Storm and
El Curioso.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Russell Baze. The leading jockey at Bay Meadows had
five winners Monday to widen his lead over runner-up Jason Lumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: California racing. New York tracks wisely took two days
off after a six-day week, thanks to the Columbus Day holiday, but
both Santa Anita and Bay Meadows are back in action after only a
one-day respite.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Girl Talk in the first
and Disguys Dalimit in the second and using Rehabilitated, Rainman's
Request, Snoopy Cat, Brazil Nut and Highly Suspect in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/26. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $2.80/$155.20. Total money bet: $190.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Have Some Points to Make</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings and Mighty Ducks renew an unusual but intense rivalry
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Ducks joined the NHL in 1993, the teams have been on a
roller coaster ride. If one team is up, the other is down. If one
team is a playoff contender, it's almost certain that the other is
rebuilding and fighting to stay out of last place.</LD>
<LD>   But that hasn't prevented the games from being fierce.</LD>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, it's a rivalry," said defenseman Mathieu
Schneider, who joined the Kings before the start of the 2000-01
season. "Since I've been here, the games against the Ducks have
always been very competitive. Because of the situation that they've
been in over the last couple of seasons, they've been able to point
to games like these to try and turn their season around."</TE>
<TE>   For the last couple seasons, the Kings have ruled L.A.'s little
hockey world. This season, the Ducks believe they are ready to mount
a challenge, thanks to off-season moves made by General Manager Bryan
Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "They are obviously a much improved team," King Coach Andy Murray
said of the Ducks, who will host tonight's game at the Arrowhead Pond
at 7:30. "They've had the potential to win each game that they've
played so far.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched all three of their games ... in person. They've
added some veteran leadership with [Adam] Oates and [Fredrik]
Olausson, and having [Petr] Sykora definitely helps their team. We
have to realize that they upgraded their talent level. I have a lot
of respect about what they've done."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Ducks head into tonight's game under first-year Coach
Mike Babcock with a 1-2 record. "We can talk about us getting better
until we're blue in the face, but you have to get points in order to
stay in the hunt," said Babcock, whose Ducks will fall four points
behind the 2-0 Kings if they lose in regulation tonight. "We've said
that so many times already. We have to keep working to get better,
that's our focus. But you still have to win games, especially at
home."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings lead the series 21-19-9, and had a 4-0-1 record against
the Ducks last season. Anaheim holds an 11-8-5 edge in games at the
Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Since Anaheim has been in the league, the Kings have made the
playoffs four times, including the last three seasons. The Ducks have
qualified only twice. They have never met in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the New York Rangers versus the New York Islanders but
heated rivalries like that develop because of playoff series against
each other," Schneider said. "That's what has happened with us and
Detroit and Colorado. Playing them in the playoffs the last couple of
years has made our [regular-season] games that much more intense."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider could only imagine what it would be like to face the
Ducks in postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always extra feelings when you can just get on a bus and
then, in less than an hour, be playing a road game," he said. "You're
playing for your city and your fans. That makes the game that much
more important."</TE>
<TE>   But, providing the Kings stay sharp, a King-Duck playoff matchup
can happen only if the Ducks start winning. Babcock understands this
very well and he's looking for his team to get off to a fast start
tonight, something the Ducks have failed to do so far.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be better than we've been," Babcock said. "Whatever
the reason, we have to find a way to dictate the play. Especially in
your building, it's up to you to set the ante.... The team that
scores first in the NHL is in the driver's seat every time."</TE>
<TE>   A position the Ducks hope to take against the Kings tonight.</TE>

<LD>The Kings and Mighty Ducks represented the penthouse and outhouse in
the NHL last season when it came to playing with a man advantage. Los
Angeles had the league's best power play and Anaheim the worst.</LD>
<LD>   But things have changed. With four goals in 17 opportunities over
their first three games, the Ducks had the fifth-best power play in
the NHL before Tuesday's games, while the Kings are in the middle of
the pack at No. 16 (three for 16).</LD>
<LD>   And the Ducks have been doing it without much help from their big
guns, Paul Kariya and Adam Oates, who have combined for one goal and
one assist for the 1-2 Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   "Their chances have been numerous," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said.
"And any time you're getting numerous chances, that's good compared
to not having any chances. That's when you have to start looking to
hit the panic button.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] you have to take advantage of your power plays....
Specialty teams have always been a big part of the game, but now it's
even more drastic."</TE>
<TE>   Center Andy McDonald and winger Mike Leclerc have been playing
well. McDonald leads the Ducks with one goal and four points,
including one power-play goal. Leclerc also has scored on a power
play but has most impressed Babcock by doing the dirty work on a line
with Kariya and Oates.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Leclerc has been a dominant player," Babcock said. "He's a
big guy, who skates, goes to the body, goes to the net and creates
space for those guys all of the time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just call King Coach Andy Murray a realist when it comes to the
Kings' 2-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played quite well, but we understand what it is," he said.
"Every game will be a battle this year, that's why you have to go
after it every single night because everyone is so good now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to the injury report for tonight's game, the Ducks will
be without defenseman Pavel Trnka, who tried to practice Tuesday but
was unable to finish because of a leg injury. To fill out the roster,
the Ducks decided not to send defenseman Josh DeWolf to American
Hockey League affiliate Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks assigned center Jason Krog to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, winger Ziggy Palffy did not practice Tuesday to
rest a groin injury. Murray said he expects Palffy to play tonight.</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal's recovery will not be without complication.</LD>
<LD>   Five weeks after surgery to ease pain and restore flexibility in
his right big toe, O'Neal said Tuesday that he was experiencing
discomfort in the toe.</LD>
<LD>   Though the pain is not in the specific area of the surgery and so
far hasn't kept him from his rehabilitation schedule, O'Neal left no
doubt as to how it felt.</LD>
<TE>   "It's killing me," he said at the Lakers' practice facility in El
Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Gary Vitti said O'Neal was suffering from sesamoiditis, or
inflammation of the tendons on the underside of the toe, probably
brought on by the new flexibility provided by the surgery. Vitti also
said that the condition was a fairly normal part of the healing
process.</TE>
<TE>   Neither O'Neal nor Vitti suggested that the pain, which apparently
set in at least a week ago, constituted a major setback. Indeed,
O'Neal said, he trotted on a Precor machine, which allows him to run
without excessive pounding, while the Lakers practiced.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he would be examined today by Dr. Robert Mohr, who
performed the Sept. 11 procedure at UCLA Medical Center. Until now,
O'Neal's recovery had been uneventful.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers open their season Oct. 29, 13 days from today, though
that has never been a target date for O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to get back by opening night," O'Neal said. "I'll
get back when the time is right."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said he was "not nervous at all" about O'Neal,
though he then suggested O'Neal hadn't followed the instructions of
his rehabilitation to the letter.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been out here doing some things kind of interesting,"
Jackson said. "But there's nothing he can hurt.... If he quits
fooling around with it, he'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, who has a strained lower back, may play Thursday night
in an exhibition against Golden State at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Mark Madsen, who began last season on the injured list
recuperating from wrist surgery, might again carry an injury into the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   He continues to receive treatment on his strained left hamstring,
but remains questionable to play in another exhibition game.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark is still a ways away," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A pitcher in high school who still watches a lot of National
League baseball -- "Real baseball," he said -- Jackson has not been
swept away by the Angels' run to the World Series, but he appreciates
the methods of Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire the way he's talked to his team about focus," Jackson
said.</TE>

<KH>ON BASEBALL/ WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Sunday Was Father's Day for Kennedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, now it is late Sunday afternoon and the Angels are staging a
hug-fest in the middle of the Edison Field diamond, celebrating their
first American League pennant, and an older gentleman who doesn't
have a media credential is climbing up a temporary photographer's
stand to capture the moment with his camera, trying to shake security
personnel who are threatening, he says in reflection, "to carry me
away."</LD>
<LD>   This, of course, is not the normal behavior of a 52-year-old
history and sociology teacher at Riverside North High, but as Tom
Kennedy says, "I was ecstatic, stunned and beyond knowing how to
act."</LD>
<LD>   Who could blame him?</LD>
<TE>   There were 44,834 others in Edison Field who pretty much didn't
know how to act either -- and none had a son who had just joined Babe
Ruth, Reggie Jackson and George Brett, among others, in hitting three
home runs in a postseason game.</TE>
<TE>   The performance by second baseman Adam Kennedy in Game 5 of the
American League championship series against the Minnesota Twins
helped lift the Angels into the World Series and earned Kennedy the
ALCS' most-valuable-player trophy that he has since given to his dad.</TE>
<TE>   Not for his dexterity in climbing on that photo stand, but for the
lessons of life and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "He's responsible for who I am and where I am," Kennedy was saying
Tuesday. "He put a ball in my hand when I was 2 years old and let me
run with it. He taught me the enjoyment of the game -- to appreciate
it, respect it, how to play it right."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kennedy is touched by that, humbled by the MVP trophy ("He
didn't have to say a word when he gave it to me because it spoke for
him") and quick to credit his wife, Susie, for her disciplinary
touch. As for putting a ball in Adam's hand when he was 2?</TE>
<TE>   "The way I remember it is that he threw an 88-mph fastball back at
me and I knew something was up here," Kennedy said with a laugh and a
stretch, clearly having a better idea that something might be up with
his oldest son while serving as North's baseball coach from 1991 to
1998, winning a Southern Section title in 1994 with Adam as a senior
shortstop and his brother, Bryan, as a freshman third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Kennedy, who had played at UC Riverside, retired from
coaching when Bryan, now a catcher in the Minnesota organization,
moved on to Long Beach State and Adam was coming out of Cal State
Northridge as the St. Louis Cardinals' No. 1 draft choice in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, Adam leans on Angel batting instructor Mickey
Hatcher and gets off-season swing help from Mike Batesole, his former
Northridge coach, and his dad, as Tom Kennedy put it, "is more
personal cheerleader than a coach anymore. He's surpassed my
knowledge in all aspects."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, once a coach always a coach. There was Adam Kennedy,
having already homered twice, coming to bat with two on, none out,
and the Angels trailing, 5-3, in the seventh inning Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   What was his dad thinking?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking, 'Get that bunt down, son' " Tom Kennedy said of the
obvious sacrifice situation. "Of course, when he fouled it off, I
couldn't help but stop being a coach and start being a dad again. I
was actually happy because I thought he might get a chance to swing
the bat again."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia was thinking right along with the
former North coach. Scioscia took the bunt off, and Kennedy launched
a three-run homer on a two-strike pitch, igniting a 10-run inning
that ultimately put his dad on the photo stand, the Angels in the
World Series and Kennedy in the record book, a perspective from which
he reflected while preparing for the club's workout Tuesday and said:
"You know, I got about five steps out of the batter's box after
hitting that third home run and said to myself, 'I can't believe it,
there's no way that just happened.' It was pretty surreal, pretty
amazing, and such a big game for us, the city, myself.</TE>
<TE>   "You see guys hit three home runs in a game during the season and
the next day they're playing another one of 162. I hit three and
we're going to the World Series, and that makes everybody in this
clubhouse proud. Hopefully, it's the start of a new kind of positive
history."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it casts a new light on Kennedy's personal history, and
while three home runs in a game and four in nine postseason games
might not mesh with seven during the regular season, his improvement
at the plate and in the field has been a steady work in progress
since his acquisition with the long-gone Kent Bottenfeld for Jim
Edmonds on March 23, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Kennedy was the AL's seventh leading hitter at .312
(the third-highest average for a No. 9 hitter since 1974), and had
the AL's hottest single month when he hit .404 in August. Scioscia
calls him the most improved Angel, largely because his advancement on
defense while working diligently with coach Alfredo Griffin ("He
should be paid overtime," Kennedy said) has allowed him to remain in
the lineup, getting close to 500 at-bats a year.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, the former shortstop has slowly come to grips with a new
league, new position, and playing at home under the shadow of the
Edmonds trade, to which he has helped restore equality after the
Bottenfeld bust.</TE>
<TE>   "My only objective has been to prove to the Angels and myself that
I belong in a big league situation," Kennedy said. "The trade has
never been an issue with me. I never set out to justify it. I also
have no hard feelings toward the Cardinals for trading me.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing simply wasn't right in St. Louis. They needed a second
baseman who could bat leadoff on a contending team, and I wasn't
ready. Walt Jocketty [the Cardinals' general manager] is one of my
favorite people in baseball and I'll always be grateful to him for
trading me into a situation where the manager has been supportive and
patient and there has been a payoff for the club and myself."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Kennedy said, he doesn't delight in the Cardinals'
elimination from the playoffs. He has also learned -- although it is
difficult at times -- to control his admitted frustration when Benji
Gil, who was the first to greet and embrace Kennedy after his third
home run Sunday, gets the second base assignment against some
left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, egos are pretty much out the door," Kennedy said.
"We're 3-0 against left-handers in the postseason, so I can't argue
with success. The way Mike uses the roster, everyone feels a part of
it, everyone is ready to play. It's been a fun ride, and the way
Benji and I support each other makes it easier."</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, Kennedy has received each of the balls he launched
over the fence Sunday, costing him only a couple bats in exchange.
One was retrieved by an Edison Field employee, another by the
roommate of a family friend and the third was given him by a fan when
he appeared on a TV show after "Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   "Hard to believe," he said. "It's as if they fell into my lap."</TE>
<TE>   On the night of his record-tying accomplishment, Kennedy
celebrated by hosting family and friends at his Yorba Linda home for
pizza and "SportsCenter," or as his dad said, "Isn't that what
everybody does every night?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, not when the highlights keep rolling and it's tough to get
to sleep because, as Adam Kennedy said, "You tend to want to watch
one more time."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, reality hit for father and son. Adam Kennedy had to
take his 9-month-old son to the doctor because of a cold.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kennedy got up to prepare a brown bag lunch for his return to
the classroom and that tends "to bring you back to earth in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   Better, however, than falling off a photo stand.</TE>

<LD>John LeClair scored four goals and Mark Recchi had a goal and two
assists to lead the visiting Philadelphia Flyers to a 6-2 victory
over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   LeClair, who began his career with Montreal, has 28 goals and 43
points in 29 regular-season games against the Canadiens since he was
traded to the Flyers on Feb. 9, 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Marty Murray also scored for Philadelphia, which completed its
season-opening three-game trip with five of a possible six points.</LD>
<TE>   Canadien goalie Jose Theodore -- last season's league MVP -- has

<HD>Owens' Latest Signature Move</HD>
<DH>After his autographed ball stunt, 49er receiver avoids a
fine, but not the wrath of Seahawks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next time San Francisco's Terrell Owens pulls out a pen during a
game, he also might need to produce his checkbook.</LD>
<LD>   An NFL spokesman said Tuesday the league has no plan to fine Owens
for his antics Monday in a 28-21 victory at Seattle -- the 49er
receiver celebrated a touchdown catch by autographing the ball in the
end zone with a black Sharpie pen pulled from his sock -- but the
league will respond more harshly if it happens again.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people saw it as humorous, others as taunting," spokesman
Greg Aiello said. "If it happens again, the player who does it will
receive an autographed letter from Gene Washington," the league's man
in charge of levying fines.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren called the display "shameful" and "a
dishonor to anybody who's played this game."</TE>
<TE>   The incident happened in the fourth quarter when Owens scored the
decisive touchdown on a 37-yard reception over Pro Bowl cornerback
Shawn Springs. TV cameras caught Owens pulling the felt-tipped pen
from his sock, signing the ball, and handing it to a spectator in a
field-level suite belonging to Springs. It wasn't just a fan at
random, but rather Greg Eastman, the financial advisor for both Owens
and Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a T.O. thing," Owens explained. "My coach in college always
said, 'Always shine brightest when the lights are on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Springs got a kick out of the inside joke -- "It's something I'd
do if I was a wideout" -- but he was in the clear minority among the
Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   "He disrespected us in our own stadium," Seattle defensive lineman
Chad Eaton said. "It goes to show you he has no class."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow defensive tackle John Randle said, "It's embarrassing to us
and embarrassing to the league. Things like that don't look good."</TE>
<TE>   Lighten up, say the 49er players.</TE>
<TE>   "That was tight," running back Kevan Barlow said with an approving
smile.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Mariucci said he hadn't seen Owens signing the ball
and learned about it when a reporter told him as they were walking
off the field. Long after the game, Mariucci spotted a Sharpie lying
in a hallway outside the locker room. He picked it up and examined it
as if studying a moon rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this it?" he asked. "Is this the one?"</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday Mariucci defended Owens.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens all the time where a guy will score a touchdown and go
give it to his mom or girlfriend," Mariucci said. "There weren't any
obscene gestures, there was no taunting toward the bench, or the
crowd -- it was a friendly gesture to some mutual friend that they
had. The only unusual thing was the Sharpie out of the sock."</TE>
<TE>   The suite belonging to Springs is directly behind the end zone the
49ers were going for in the fourth quarter. When his team started
heading that direction, Owens requested a pen from a 49er trainer and
tucked it between his inner and outer socks.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure he didn't find it in the corner of the end zone?"
Mariucci asked, sounding more amused than irritated. "We don't teach
that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being one of the best receivers in football, Owens has
caused the 49ers plenty of headaches over the last few years. He
embarrassed the organization by sprinting to the midfield star at
Texas Stadium and dancing on it after scoring a touchdown against the
Cowboys. After a loss to the Bears last season, he said Mariucci
hadn't wanted to run up the score on his buddy, Chicago Coach Dick
Jauron, and therefore had failed to put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   For most of 2001, Mariucci and Owens barely spoke. It got so bad
that Owens asked the 49ers to put him on the expansion-draft list so
he could play for the Houston Texans. Things didn't improve until
April, when Mariucci flew to Atlanta and met Owens and his agent in
an airport hotel. They talked for hours and ironed out their
differences.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was necessary, and it was worth doing," Mariucci said
in August. "We had a productive discussion. We both got things off
our chest that we've been carrying for too long. We needed that."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it didn't completely clear the air. Owens has been
critical of his teammates and coaches again this season. After a
narrow victory over Washington, he said the 49ers lacked "killer
instinct."</TE>
<TE>   So his stunt Monday was not terribly surprising. But it did create
instant bad blood with the Seahawks, new this season to the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's a slap in the face," Seattle linebacker Isaiah
Kacyvenski said. "I'll be excited to play him again."</TE>

<HD>Pac-10: Officials Missed USC Call</HD>
<DH>Commissioner says Kelly's catch should not have counted, as
scrutiny of on-field rulings intensifies in college football.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific 10 football officials who ruled that USC's Kareem Kelly
had scored a second-quarter touchdown Saturday against California
made the wrong call, conference Commissioner Tom Hansen said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It should not have been a touchdown," Hansen said of the ruling
made by back judge Jim Northcott and field judge Michael Mothershed.</LD>
<LD>   The touchdown allowed USC to trim an 18-point deficit to 21-10.
The Trojans went on to win the game, 30-28, and the victory stands.</LD>
<TE>   Video replays showed Kelly trapping the third-down pass against
the ground, but Pac-10 spokesman Jim Muldoon said the repercussions
would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Muldoon said the officiating crew would remain on its scheduled
rotation, that no member was in danger of forfeiting an $825-a-game
assignment this season, and that any additional criticism would be
handled internally. The game officials could get poor grades from
conference film graders and Verle Sorgen, coordinator of officials.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Coach Jeff Tedford had an extensive discussion with Sorgen on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of issues with the officiating in that game ... the
touchdown that wasn't a touchdown," Tedford said Tuesday. "I don't
think that was a stellar performance by the officiating crew by any
means. You grade the officials every week, and we wrote down all the
things that we saw that were poorly called. It goes on both sides of
the ball. There was one where we had an illegal motion and it didn't
get called. So we reported ourselves too, because that's what we have
to do to help with the officiating. They have a tough job ... but I
thought the officiating in the game was sub-par."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen's acknowledgment of the miscall was the latest example of
the increased public scrutiny of game officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the Big Ten, Commissioner Jim Delany ruled earlier this month
that officials who'd worked Purdue's 24-21 loss to Wake Forest, an
Atlantic Coast Conference team, on Sept. 21 had been punished by
"forfeiting future assignments." Such situations frequently rouse
speculation that the officials, who work as independent contractors,
have possibly been involved in gambling. But Delany said that was not
an issue in this case.</TE>
<TE>   He said the discipline had been based strictly on calls during the
game and that each of the officials would return to work before the
end of the season. Delany has defended his action as what should be
expected from a detached third party who must exercise disciplinary
discretion while holding officials and coaches to accountable
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Muldoon said the Pac-10's stance of handling officials' errors
internally could help defuse future tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, you're better off doing it in-house," Muldoon said.
"You don't want [officials] looking over their shoulder so much."</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten official Dick Honig didn't look over his shoulder Sept. 28
as he left Penn State's field after an overtime victory by Iowa. Penn
State Coach Joe Paterno chased down Honig, grabbed his shirt and
questioned him about "a couple of lousy calls on the other side of
the field." Delany did not discipline Paterno.</TE>
<TE>   Paterno raised criticism of the Big Ten officials again Tuesday.
On Saturday, Penn State was deprived of attempting a tying field goal
in the final minute of a 27-24 loss to Michigan when an official
ruled a receiver out of bounds, voiding a catch at the Wolverines'
23-yard line. A replay showed the receiver had both feet inbounds.
Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley called Monday for a
comprehensive review of Big Ten officials.</TE>
<TE>   Said Paterno, "There were some concerns about the assignment of
the same crew this year that worked our Michigan game [last year].
There were some concerns about the fact that three of them live in
Michigan. There were some concerns that some of them said to me that
they had met with Dick Honig, who lives in Ann Arbor. Those kinds of
things are what they should be looking at. Not necessarily that
anybody is incompetent. We are all human beings and have friends and
impulses. I think that is what Penn State would like to see have
done. Just re-examine how officials are assigned."</TE>
<TE>   Utah Coach Ron McBride similarly questioned a Pac-10 official's
allegiance after a Ute receiver was ruled out of bounds while
catching what McBride thought should have been a winning touchdown
pass in a 23-17 loss to Arizona on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lead official Jim Fogltance is] a big UA guy," McBride told the
Salt Lake Tribune. "He lives there and has always been a big
supporter."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen said he viewed all replays and determined the receiver had
been out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an imperfect science, but we're convinced our officials care
and that they miss very few calls," Hansen said.</TE>

<KH>Bill Plaschke/ WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Smartest Move Probably Isn't the Bravest One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a World Series of mostly fabricated matchups -- geographically
challenged San Francisco Giant fans chanting "Beat L.A."? -- there is
one that is deliciously real.</LD>
<LD>   Angel bravado versus Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The team that issued the fewest intentional walks in baseball
versus the player who was intentionally walked more than anybody in
history.</LD>
<TE>   A group of raging bulls versus a champion counter-puncher just
waiting to knock them out.</TE>
<TE>   It could be magnificent. It could be messy. Four days before Game
1 at Edison Field on Saturday, it is alive and piquing.</TE>
<TE>   Wondered Tim Salmon: "Does he ever make an out?"</TE>
<TE>   Growled Troy Percival: "I'm going after him like everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Explained Scott Schoeneweis: "He is like Babe Ruth."</TE>
<TE>   Warned Jarrod Washburn: "I hate pitching around anybody."</TE>
<TE>   There are as many story lines in this series as flasks in Giant
fans' pockets. But there will be only one continuing drama, with
characters as clearly defined as a Giant fan's whine.</TE>
<TE>   There is Angel Manager Mike Scioscia. He didn't make a living
waving his glove at guys as they crossed home plate, he pummeled
them.</TE>
<TE>   There are his Angel pitchers. They don't make a living twirling in
the corners, they wing it.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Bonds, who loves hitting against that aggressive
combination of manager and pitcher as much as he loves brushing off a
cocksure autograph seeker.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can't wait to show him they are not afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds can't wait to show them they should be very afraid.</TE>
<TE>   So what gives?</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels are smart -- and Scioscia is old-time Dodger smart
-- they will give.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds wants to swing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the chest-thumping from their fans and jeers from their
enemies, the Angels should not let him.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Cox let him hit, and his home run helped the Giants beat the
Atlanta Braves in the clinching game of their National League
divisional series.</TE>
<TE>   Tony La Russa let him hit, and his two-run triple helped the
Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the critical opener of the
league championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Until the final weeks of the regular season, Jim Tracy let him
hit, and his six home runs essentially eliminated the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote a similar column last month from Chavez Ravine as Tom
Lasorda stood over my shoulder and waved four fingers every time the
unhappy but unstoppable slug strolled to home plate.</TE>
<TE>   I was accused by everyone else of being a chicken.</TE>
<TE>   So, what the heck, so I'll cluck on down to Orange County and try
again.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, Angels? The most effective scouting report on Bonds goes
something like this:</TE>
<TE>   If one of his swings can tie the score, or give his team the lead,
or increase his team's lead, you walk him.</TE>
<TE>   Walk him. Walk him. Walk him.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two seasons, in 879 at-bats, he has recorded 733
total bases, which is close enough to one base per at-bat to make it
statistically favorable to walk him.</TE>
<TE>   Emotionally, it can be even more critical. Just ask Byron Scott.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two games of last spring's NBA finals, he was
determined that his New Jersey Nets would not double-team Shaquille
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   His fans loved it. His team hated it. Scott's bravado not only
lost two games, but it demoralized a locker room and doomed a series.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia, in fact, mentioned the Nets on Tuesday, as well as the
foolishness of teams that once decided to use single coverage on late
Dallas Cowboy star Bob Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of positive things that come out of bravado,"
Scioscia said. "But sometimes, you have to step back and swallow your
pride."</TE>
<TE>   Idealistically, the Angels will realize that the next week is one
of those times.</TE>
<TE>   Realistically, the Angels being a team that hears only its heart,
that probably won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's workout, they talked about the dangers of facing
hot-hitting Benito Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't like there's a 12-year-old batting behind Bonds,"
Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   No. In fact, in my earlier column, I referred to Santiago as being
80 years old, for which I must now apologize. He doesn't look a day
over 60.</TE>
<TE>   And if the ruddy catcher repeats his NLCS performance and beats
the Angels, then the Giants have earned it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also talked about the danger of walking anybody,
period.</TE>
<TE>   "You start to walk people just to walk them, you're going to have
a problem," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Ben Weber's usual unusual take.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, he can't hit everything out of the park, can he?" Weber
asked. "Somebody's got to get lucky and get him out, right? The way I
look at it, maybe I'll be that lucky one. So I want to pitch to him."</TE>
<TE>   All the Angels want to pitch to him. At some point during the
World Series, they might all get a chance.</TE>
<TE>   It will be wonderful theater. And it could cost them a
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Everything that big-bellied bricklayer coach once screamed at your
trembling figure in the batter's box is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   A walk is not as good as a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Not when the hitter is Barry Bonds.</TE>

<LD>These people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Krisag: "I used to respect you. How dare you bash your own
home-town team just because you could not go to the Angels game. You
are the most negative, arrogant journalist the Times has ever had. If
you don't like hockey, then leave the business. Go to hell ..."</LD>
<TE>   Too many hockey fans already there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Cook: Let's see, Wayne Gretsky and T.J. Simers. One person
has achieved greatness, left records that will never be broken, is a
role model and loved in Los Angeles. The other, a despicable human
being, an ingrate, a leech, and despised in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for spelling my name correctly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Scarpelli: "I'm convinced the Internet is mainly for idiots or
Disney marketing people. Here's Sunday's CNN/SI sports poll (on the
Internet): What is the main reason for the Angels (success)? Quality
starters: 18%; Glaus' clutch hits: 12%; Lights-out bullpen: 21%; The
rally monkey: 49%."</TE>
<TE>   You would know more about that than I would.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Werner Haas: "Here's the most disturbing thought of the week: If
Charles Darwin is correct, we are all descended from the rally
monkey."</TE>
<TE>   That would explain why Rex Hudler is always jumping up and down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Hacker: "I appreciated your reminding Tom Lasorda about Jim
Tracy's dog's mistreatment of the Rally Monkey -- it's one thing to
let your dog tear the monkey up, but it's quite another to laugh
about the fact that there was nothing left but the eyes. I don't see
the Dodgers anywhere today. Fear the wrath of the Rally Monkey."</TE>
<TE>   I fear Tracy's dog more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rev. Ginny Wagener: "I thought your column on the Rally Monkey was
laughing out loud funny. I am feeling now I have misjudged your sense
of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Rev., it takes some of us longer to get religion than others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gretchen: "Gretzky has been a great role model for youngsters
throughout his career. Would you rather have athletes like Iverson,
Sprewell, Steve Howe and Strawberry be the type of people our youth
aspire to be one day?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes. I write columns, and I'd like to have something interesting
to write about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CaptBobOU: "I've never wanted to waste my time responding to your
column, but after your (Gretzky column), I couldn't help myself.
Here's a list of L.A. sports figures you don't mess with: Chick
Hearn, Vin Scully, Sandy Koufax, Magic Johnson and Wayne Gretzky."</TE>
<TE>   And all this time I've been backing off John Wooden and that silly
pyramid pabulum he spews because I thought he was on the list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philip Golden: "Sacred Cows. Rule No. 1 in my mind being a sports
writer in L.A.: Don't mess with Tommy Lasorda."</TE>
<TE>   We all could lose a few pounds, but I would never call Lasorda a
cow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lori Kamler: "You were wrong about the Angels ... from the few
times I have read the Los Angeles Times, I gather you're a Dodgers'
fan."</TE>
<TE>   I can't get anything past you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon McNatty: "I would expect the Times to actually cover the event
for Gretzky with some class and respect for what he has done for the
game and the city. Instead they send a reporter who obviously does
not understand the game of hockey or its history."</TE>
<TE>   I disagree. I think Helene Elliott is a terrific hockey writer.
You have to be a terrific hockey writer to get me to read a hockey
story, and I read one of hers once.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   C Christmas: "Try to keep an open mind about soccer in the U.S. I
started watching six years ago and now enjoy it most of all major
sports."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not surprised it took a team that long to score a goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Vetti: "Hey moron, plenty of people enjoy hockey in L.A, and
as for Mr. Gretzky's taste in women, you would never had a chance at
his wife in a million years."</TE>
<TE>   I'd have been willing to call her "The Great One."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Romero: "You're a jerk, and I intend to tell anyone who will
listen."</TE>
<TE>   I guess that's why you had to come to me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Murray: "I'll add your comments to my 999 reasons to hate
T.J. Simers. Instead of being such a basketball honk, try showing
some respect to a sport that you obviously have no understanding
about, and write it straight."</TE>
<TE>   You got something against alternative writing?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Wilson: "What a sad life you must lead."</TE>
<TE>   Sports columnist Bill Plaschke is thinking about writing a column
about me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vinnie Aven: "It's a wonder your teeth haven't been knocked out by
Adam Deadmarsh. I hope he doesn't do an awful thing like that; what
he should really do is break every one of your fingers so you can't
type."</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that a little extreme? I only type with two fingers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes from Charlie Boule:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sharing this letter I just forwarded to my dad, who was
recently diagnosed with prostate cancer: 'Dad, I'll never forget the
time we went to an Angels' game and stood around waiting to get an
autograph. I remember going from one player to the next. After I
received an autograph from Albie Pearson, I patiently waited in line
for my next signature. Once the crowd thinned, I noticed a familiar
face, and he was no Angel. I pushed a kid to the side and said,
'Excuse me, that's my dad, he's not on the Angels.' You looked at me,
smiled, and said, 'Wait your turn, kid, I'll be with you in a
moment.' Little did I realize, but with all the autographs I received
that day none would hold a candle to Jim Boule's signature, and the
lasting impression you left with me -- as my one and only role
model."</TE>

<HD>Keane Is Fined and Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Keane, the controversial midfielder who is captain of Ireland's
national team and Manchester United, was suspended for five English
Premier League games and fined nearly a quarter of a million dollars
Tuesday -- all because of something he said in a ghost-written
autobiography.</LD>
<LD>   After a seven-hour hearing, the disciplinary committee of the
English Football Assn. ruled that Keane, 31, had brought the game
into disrepute by claiming in the book that he had deliberately
injured Alf Inge Haaland of Manchester City in a game in 2001 and
then written about it for financial reward.</LD>
<LD>   The committee fined Keane a record $233,100.</LD>
<TE>   Keane, who was thrown off the Irish World Cup team this summer
after a highly publicized clash with Coach Mick McCarthy and who has
been red-carded nine times in his Manchester United career, has 14
days to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In the autobiography -- ghost-written by Irish journalist Eamon
Dunphy -- Keane said he'd wanted to get back at Haagland, who earlier
had accused him of feigning injury.</TE>
<TE>   Jail for Tofting</TE>
<TE>   Denmark national team midfield hard man Stig "the Lawn Mower"
Tofting was sentenced to four months in jail after being found guilty
of assault for head-butting the manager of a Copenhagen restaurant
where Tofting and his Danish teammates had gathered for a post-World
Cup party.</TE>
<TE>   Tofting, 33, who also punched one of the restaurant's chefs, plays
for Bolton Wanderers in England and will not serve the sentence until
the appeal process is over.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Coaches Fired</TE>
<TE>   Two more Mexican league coaches were fired, bringing to seven the
number who have lost their jobs three months into the season.</TE>
<TE>   Queretaro dismissed Mario Zanabria and replaced him with Demetrio
Madero, and Chiapas slammed the door behind Salvador Capitano,
bringing in Jorge Garces in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Each team is in last place in its league group.</TE>
<TE>   Scots Top Canada</TE>
<TE>   Striker Dwayne DeRosario of the San Jose Earthquakes scored on a
ninth-minute penalty kick for Canada, but Scotland replied with three
goals, two by Steve Crawford and one by Steven Thompson, defeating
the Canadians, 3-1, in a friendly match at Edinburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Nakata Leads Japan</TE>
<TE>   Former Brazil World Cup standout Zico, whose first game as Japan's
coach is today against Jamaica at Tokyo, selected Italian-based
midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, 25, of Parma, the team's captain.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>It Doesn't Take Niusulu Long to Get First Sack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one moment, UCLA defensive tackle C.J. Niusulu went from
interminably waiting to actively contributing.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman from Barstow was going to redshirt until junior
tackle Rodney Leisle broke his foot against Oregon State. So Niusulu
found himself in the maelstrom against Oregon, and on one of his
first plays he sacked Jason Fife.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a feeling when Rodney got hurt that they'd put me in that
situation," he said. "I was proud they had confidence in me."</LD>
<TE>   Niusulu (6 feet 2, 302 pounds) was in the game for about 20 plays
and had two tackles. Ryan Boschetti, a junior college transfer who
started in place of Leisle, had four tackles, including a sack.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances, they both did a good job," defensive
line coach Don Johnson said. "With experience C.J. will understand
blocking schemes and will be able to anticipate better.</TE>
<TE>   "Ryan has great quickness but he regresses back to some of his JC
techniques when he gets excited."</TE>
<TE>   Leisle, a preseason Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award candidate,
will miss at least three more games. He is on crutches.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had somebody helping him get to and from class," Johnson
said. "He's in good spirits, all things considered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Griffith is struggling and other Bruin kickers are clamoring
for an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Punters Nate Fikse and Chris Kluwe want to try their hand -- or
foot -- at field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready," Fikse said. "I've been waiting for a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Fikse, a senior, is one of the nation's best punters, averaging a
Pacific 10 Conference-best 44.1 yards. Only six of his last 21 punts
have been returned.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches told him he would attempt field goals beyond the range of
Griffith, whose longest is 49 yards. But Fikse has been called upon
only once, on the last play of the first half against Colorado. His
55-yard attempt was wide.</TE>
<TE>   He practices kicking field goals in practice every day and would
like to kick anything longer than 40-45 yards in games.</TE>
<TE>   But he stopped asking coaches about getting a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like beating a dead horse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kluwe, a redshirt sophomore, made 16 field goals -- including one
of 60 yards -- for Los Alamitos High in 1999. He has waited patiently
behind Griffith and Fikse for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo said Monday that Kluwe was strictly a punter. On
Tuesday, however, the coach amended his comment, saying that Kluwe
will get a good look as a kicker during the spring.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, Griffith will kick point-after attempts and
field-goal attempts under 50 yards despite having a slightly sore
knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Griffith has won football games for us and Chris Griffith
will win more games in the future," Toledo said. "Young people are
fragile, you have to be careful. I'm going to continue to show
confidence in him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A date for a preliminary hearing will be set today in cornerback
Ricky Manning's felony assault case. The charges stem from a fight at
a Westwood bar in April.... Safety Ben Emanuel (neck) practiced
Tuesday but did not participate in contact drills.... Cornerbacks
Matt Ware (back) and Joe Hunter (flu) returned to practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California quarterback Kyle Boller missed last season's game
against UCLA because of a back injury and it appeared his
availability might be in jeopardy again when he hurt his left hand
last week against USC.</TE>
<TE>   However, the senior from Newhall Hart High is practicing and is
expected to play Saturday against the Bruins.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Cody Is Out for the Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC suffered a major blow Tuesday when defensive tackle Shaun Cody
learned that he will be out the rest of the season because of a torn
ligament in his left knee that requires surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Cody, a 6-foot-4, 275-pound sophomore, was injured in the second
quarter of the No. 19 Trojans' 30-28 victory over California last
Saturday. He had an MRI exam Monday night and hoped the test would
reveal only a bad sprain. Instead, it showed a damaged anterior
cruciate ligament.</LD>
<LD>   Cody said he would undergo surgery when the swelling subsides.</LD>
<TE>   "I was braced for the worst," said Cody, who is on crutches. "This
was the worst-case scenario, but I was ready for any answer they told
me.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of always thought that great athletes don't get hurt. It
happened. I'm ready to go to work and get back."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll called the loss of Cody, a two-year starter, "a
crusher, just a crusher."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Mike Patterson will move from nose tackle to fill Cody's
position and senior Bernard Riley, who came back from knee surgery,
will play nose tackle. Freshman LaJuan Ramsey and senior Anthony Daye
will serve as backups.</TE>
<TE>   "It obviously challenges our depth and our young players have to
be ready to step up," Carroll said. "We're fortunate to have Bernard
ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore defensive end Kenechi Udeze said the Trojans will
regroup in time for Saturday's game against No. 22 Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a good solid four that can step up and play against
any line in America and do a pretty good job," Udeze said. "Losing
Shaun is major, but we should be OK if we keep everybody healthy and
get the young guys going."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Alex Holmes said he was pleased with his season-high
five receptions for 65 yards against Cal and looked forward to more
chances to catch the ball and run with it.</TE>
<TE>   "It affords me opportunity to use my size to my advantage," said
Holmes, a 6-3, 265-pound junior. "When I can run a little bit and get
my momentum going, that's when I think I'm at my best.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been the dominating blocker that I can be in terms of
pancaking somebody every play, but I think I've been effective
getting the job done and overpowering people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll confirmed that junior Marcell Allmond will start at left
cornerback in place of redshirt sophomore William Buchanon, who has
started the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way he practiced today, he played well in the [Cal]
game and he's deserving of it," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, who was switched from receiver to cornerback before the
opener, will also play against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still learning and I see it as a challenge," Buchanon said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers, who sprained his right knee against
Cal, said he would sit out Saturday's game against Washington and
possibly the game at Oregon on Oct. 26. Eric Torres will start at
left tackle Saturday.... Safety Troy Polamalu, nursing a high ankle
sprain, made it through about half of practice before stepping aside
for competitive drills.... Wide receiver Kareem Kelly is still
wearing a protective boot on his sprained right ankle and is day to
day.... Former Trojan linebacker Zeke Moreno, who plays for the San
Diego Chargers, attended practice along with former Trojan tight end
Kori Dickerson.</TE>

<HD>When the Last Cowboy Hangs Up His Spurs, What Then?</HD>
<DH>Death of ranching on public lands will put the West up for
grabs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>The cowboy is riding reluctantly into the sunset. The culture wars
and simple economics are catching up with the fabled myths of open
range, ranch and cowpoke. Once again, and maybe for the last time,
the American West is coming up for grabs.</LD>
<LD>   It's about time.</LD>
<LD>   For a good share of the last century, livestock ranchers have
reigned on 300 million acres of public lands, most of them here in
the West. You probably know the story: denuded range lands, polluted
water, exterminated wildlife -- all of it made possible by the
nation's reverence for a pioneer way of life and insidious subsidies
from urban taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   But not so fast. What comes next? As the cowboy is squeezed out by
changing values and meager earnings, who will take his place? What
ethos will take root in the last of our wide-open spaces?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps things could get worse as public-lands ranching yields to
the ranchette subdivision, to industrialized recreation and to
resource development. Or conversely, landscapes could get better with
a "re-wilding" of our public lands -- restoring buffalo and beauty,
creating elbow room worth having for generations to come. This fight
for the last of our open spaces is now intensifying as the population
center of the U.S. creeps west with each census.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the activist core of the nation's anti-grazing movement
convened in an annual war council against the cowboy. "Ranching is a
dying business in the West," said George Wuerthner, co-editor of a
comprehensive new book titled "Welfare Ranching: The Subsidized
Destruction of the American West."</TE>
<TE>   The assembled crowd expressed a consensus view: Hasten the
inevitable before more damage is done. To that end, an umbrella group
called the National Public Lands Grazing Campaign has begun lobbying
Congress and seeking support among ranchers for legislation to have
the government buy up grazing permits, cashing out with livestock
raisers to preserve families, although not their way of life. One
more subsidy payment for the sake of forest and grasslands that
belong to the citizens of the U.S. and Western states, a combined
area equal to three Californias.</TE>
<TE>   Today, for less than the cost of a can of dog food each month,
ranchers can graze a cow and a calf on federal lands (state permits
vary in cost) -- at no end of vandalism to the landscapes and webs of
life in the arid West. Even at those prices, livestock raisers are
struggling, and increasingly losing, to drought, competition from
low-cost imported meat, environmental lawsuits and a demographic
drift in which young people are fleeing the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   For all the fury over grazing, urban Americans are not likely to
notice the gradual disappearance of the public-lands rancher, at
least not at the dinner table. Less than 2% of livestock producers
rely on federal and state grazing lands. But in legend and sometimes
in fact, livestock-raising has long served to justify Western open
space. And for that reason, there was a backdrop of defensiveness,
melancholy, even a touch of dread, at this meeting of anti-grazers.
Sundown for the cowboy is dawn for ... what?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a question of [land] use or no use, but of development
or traditional use," warned William Myers, the former cattlemen's
lobbyist who is now the chief lawyer for the Bush administration's
Department of Interior. After all, this president's policy is to
favor local interests in those Western states that tilt to the GOP
and its view of progress. If not ranching, then, say, energy
development, mining, public resource privatization, real estate
speculation and surely motorized and Disney-fied recreation.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, anti-grazers assume a lush, idyllic future for
Western public lands once cows are driven off: thigh-high grass,
wildflowers, clean streams, recovering wildlife. Leaders of the
movement argue that public-lands grazing has done little to stop the
filling-in of the map's blank spots, and now is the time to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   But there is nothing to guarantee their alternative vision of
tomorrow either. The lopsided pro-development politics of the
intermountain West have all but rendered environmentalists a noisy
protest group at the ballot boxes here. The once-towering leaders of
Western conservation, like Frank Church, Morris and Stewart Udall and
William O. Douglas, seem even more quaint than the cowboy. The best
hope of today's activists lies in energizing urban residents
elsewhere in the nation to defend lands that all of us share deed to.</TE>
<TE>   "What triggers these passionate debates is that the West still
remains our field of dreams," said my colleague Frank Clifford,
author of "The Backbone of the World: A Portrait of the Vanishing
West Along the Continental Divide." "In the end, we may be able to
accommodate each other, but not all of our dreams."</TE>

<HD>Draft Would Cast a Chill Over the Military</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Bandow</AU>
<BD>Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and
author of "Human Resources and Defense Manpower" (National Defense
University, 1989), was a special assistant to President Reagan.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although many questions about how to fight a war with Iraq and how to
manage the aftermath remain unanswered, one thing is clear: The
United States will win this battle with volunteers.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever the U.S. goes to war, someone proposes a draft. That was
the case a dozen years ago in the Gulf War. It's happening again,
most recently when Jeffrey Smith, onetime general counsel to both the
CIA and the Senate Armed Services Committee, advocated forcing people
into uniform not only to conquer Iraq but to serve in the Peace Corps
and rebuild Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Here is why that's a bad idea:</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. has the most powerful and effective military on Earth.
The soldiers and sailors who use high-tech weapons today are
better-educated than the draft-era force. More than 90% of Army and
Navy recruits last year had high school diplomas, as did 96% of
Marine and 99% of Air Force recruits. Recruiting was tougher in 1998
and 1999, but even then the military's problem could have been solved
by lowering standards.</TE>
<TE>   The all-volunteer force is superior in another way: The armed
services are filled with people who desire to serve, reducing
discipline problems. Those who are discontented are released. With
conscription, the services can ill afford to kick out even the worst
performers, since doing so would reward those wanting out.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern University sociologist Charles Moskos and Paul
Glastris, editor in chief of the Washington Monthly, recognize the
need for high-quality volunteers. But they suggest a draft to bring
in sufficient numbers of recruits for support and peacekeeping duties
to "free up professional soldiers to do the fighting without
sacrificing other U.S. commitments."</TE>
<TE>   More sensible, however, would be to ask: Which commitments are
worth meeting?</TE>
<TE>   For instance, no vital national interest is at stake in the
Balkans, certainly not forcing three hostile communities to forever
live together in the artificial country of Bosnia and ensuring that
Kosovo remain an autonomous part of Serbia against the wishes of its
inhabitants. Moreover, why should the U.S. rather than Europeans
undertake that? Similarly, why do 37,000 troops remain on station in
South Korea, a nation with 40 times the gross domestic product, twice
the population and a vast technological edge over its northern
antagonist?</TE>
<TE>   Smith and others oppose using reserves to supplement our volunteer
forces in Iraq because that would make recruiting more difficult. But
why even have reserves if they aren't used when necessary?</TE>
<TE>   Conscription advocates also criticize a so-called underclass
military, even though rigorous educational and test standards mean
that few of the underclass ever suit up. Although not perfectly
representative -- in terms of percentage there are more blacks and
fewer Latinos in the military than in the population, for instance --
those in the services are generally from families with middle-class
incomes and social backgrounds. To be perfectly fair, a draft would
have to target poor as well as rich.</TE>
<TE>   Some complain that only volunteers are being asked to die for
their country. Yet New York City firefighters volunteered to defend
their fellow citizens, and 343 of them died on Sept. 11, 2001, more
than the number of servicemen and servicewomen killed in the Gulf
War, Kosovo and the war on terrorism combined. Should only volunteers
fight fires and crime? Devote their lives to the poor?</TE>
<TE>   A free society doesn't mean there are no shirkers, content to
benefit from the sacrifices of others. But that is the price of
freedom. Allowing a Washington elite to decide how everyone else
should spend his or her life is a dubious form of "fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Defending the United States means defending a free society built
on individual liberty. Renewing conscription would destroy the very
thing we are supposed to be protecting.</TE>

<HD>Inside Iraq: Reporters' Surreal Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frida Ghitis</AU>
<BD>Frida Ghitis is author of "The End of Revolution: A
Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,
2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Iraqi Ministry of Information building is bustling with the
frenzied rhythms of the international press corps. Baghdad has opted
to allow the nomadic hordes of journalists to enter the country as it
carefully calibrates international coverage. When it comes to media
manipulation, few play the game with the bluntness of Saddam
Hussein's regime.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq's visa games with the media place a challenging double
burden: Journalists have to tread delicately as they cover the news
there, and audiences around the world need to bear in mind the
constraints shaping what they see, hear and read from Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, I was in Baghdad as part of a major news organization's
coverage of a looming U.S. attack. The regime had refused access to
U.N. weapons inspectors to palace complexes throughout the nation.
The Clinton administration threatened to bomb.</LD>
<TE>   Back then few journalists had succeeded in obtaining visas to
enter the country. If a war started, any media outlet without a
presence on the ground would fare poorly. For those already in, the
competitive pressure was enormous. Professional reputations could be
created and destroyed in a new war. Having an adequate number of
people was crucial. Iraqi authorities understood the situation
perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Our principal workspace was in the Ministry of Information
building, a site we understood was on the list of military targets if
the U.S. attacked. The antiaircraft guns on the roof did nothing to
add to our sense of security. Our phones rang regularly with pleas
from friends and colleagues in other news organizations, beseeching
us to intercede in their favor as they begged the Iraqi authorities
to grant them access. But we had our own problems. We needed more
people. As the crisis dragged on, we also needed to rotate staffers
in and out of the country. We too needed the precious visas.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the truth in Iraq is all but impossible. Every day on our
assignment board we had the scheduled time for the "spontaneous
demonstrations" in support of Hussein. Every man-on-the-street
interview was conducted under the watchful gaze of a Ministry of
Information minder required to accompany us at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   To the nearly insurmountable obstacles to good journalism we had
to add the knowledge that the ministry was closely watching what we
reported. If we pushed the limit, it was likely to refuse us the new
visas. If we crossed the line, we might find ourselves out of the
country altogether.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, two of us walked into the office of a government
official to renew a visa request. He greeted us in a most cordial way
and then proceeded to extol the virtues of our competition. He made a
big show of casually shuffling papers on his desk, displaying a sheet
bearing the competition's letterhead and a list of visa requests, all
the while commenting on his concerns about our coverage. We received
his message quite clearly. We would tell the truth, but we had to be
extra careful not to upset our hosts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a colleague who had spent a great deal more time than I
in Iraq told me she managed to speak privately with a few Iraqis.
Hardly a scientific sample, but every single person expressed hope
that the U.S. would get rid of Hussein once and for all. Officially,
though, every interview gave exactly the opposite message.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the reports we receive from Baghdad include displays
of devotion to the president and no reliable information about what
the Iraqis say privately. Speaking ill of the president to a reporter
can lead to an early death in Iraq. The journalists reporting this
week on the landslide reelection of Hussein face the task of telling
the truth when they have no access to it. That leaves the rest of us
with a not very useful picture of what goes on in Iraq and with the
dangerous temptation to interpret what we see to suit our own ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that no matter how much we read or how much is
beamed to us every day, live from Baghdad, we know very little about
what is happening, and even less about how the Iraqi people feel
about a possible war on their soil.</TE>

<HD>A Paradise Lost to War on Terror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>W. Scott Thompson</AU>
<BD>W. Scott Thompson is an adjunct professor on Southeast
Asia at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</BD>
<DL>BALI, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The news was the bombing in the Kuta region of Bali, but the target
had nothing to do with this paradise. The target was first Indonesia
and its self-absorbed elite and second, but ultimately more
important, the white West.</LD>
<LD>   Bali is a symbol of globalization from the point of view of
international terrorism, despite the persistence of the local Hindu
culture. To fundamentalist Muslims it is already an excrescence: Not
only is it full of rich Western tourists, it is not even Muslim like
the rest of Indonesia. If you wanted to strike the sharpest blow
against Western influence here, you would hit Kuta and kill very few
Muslims in the process.</LD>
<LD>   The only good news is that the Indonesia government must now take
its problem of terrorism seriously because the cost of the attack
will be measured in billions of dollars. It is not just the CIA that
has been preaching to Jakarta that terrorism should be a far higher
priority. A number of Western scholars have been pointing out the
dense networks existing among radicalized Indonesian Muslim
organizations and less respectable ones in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Just after Sept. 11, Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri
pledged full cooperation with the "war on terrorism." No one should
have been optimistic about her ability to deliver, assuming she
actually wanted to. The reason that Indonesia is caught in a bind,
and is unlikely to completely escape it, is that although Islam is
vastly less potent in the sprawling archipelago than in Middle East
countries, it is still the overwhelming majority religion.</TE>
<TE>   If 1% of the population are potential recruits for terrorism, that
equals 2 million potential terrorists. And there are about 29 million
unemployed or underemployed young men, suitable targets for
recruitment.</TE>
<TE>   There are other reasons for pessimism about Jakarta's ability to
solve its problem. First, voting in Indonesia confirms a majority
tendency toward secular government, but Islamic fundamentalism is
growing.</TE>
<TE>   The second reason is that President Megawati has little ability to
lead. She has legitimacy -- her father led the revolution and was the
nation's first president -- but she plays a balancing act. Corruption
is as endemic as ever.</TE>
<TE>   But the third reason is most important. Indonesian elites don't
buy the U.S. war on terrorism, no matter what they say publicly.
"It's a self-fulfilling prophecy," one told me recently. "Your
obsession with Saddam Hussein while you let Ariel Sharon dictate your
Middle East policy makes it impossible for us to work with you
fruitfully. You don't get it."</TE>
<TE>   This sentiment is echoed widely in every Islamic country, so
Jakarta's elites hardly consider themselves odd man out. "Your 'war
on terrorism' would collapse -- because it wouldn't be needed -- the
very moment you had a balanced policy on Palestine and Israel," a
senior official said. He added that they go along with the U.S. war
only because of their great need for investment and for International
Monetary Fund approval.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the bomb in Kuta is a big incident. The Indonesian elites
were in a state of shock. They were coming to accept that their
American counterparts weren't bluffing in telling them of intercepts
revealing the intent to bomb Westerners, embassies, even Megawati.</TE>
<TE>   The price is going to be enormous. Jakarta's claim to the IMF that
it could eliminate its deficit rested on assumptions, including the
restoration of tourism after Sept. 11. But Bali represents more than
half of that.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, despite what they say, the Americans and the
Indonesians still aren't doing what needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans sincerely think they can go on their course of siding
with Israel at every real turning point ... without any problem in
Islamic capitals like ours," an Indonesian official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesians, caught in their bind of secularism and growing
Islamic fundamentalism, thought they could continue to ignore the
growing links between outside terrorists and the homegrown ones. They
can't now, but it is not obvious that they will find the strength to
do what is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists changed the whole game. The ceremonial life of Bali
will go on, but it will be a long time before the paradise lost is
regained.</TE>

<HD>Lula Will Need Ties to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his fourth attempt, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is close to winning
the presidency of Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy. Lula
took 46% of the vote in the first round of the election Sunday and is
the clear favorite in the Oct. 27 runoff. Not bad for a man born in
Brazil's impoverished northeast who couldn't attend high school and
had to go to work at an early age to help support his family.</LD>
<LD>   Lula rose to become the head of the metalworkers union and of the
largest leftist political party in Latin America. He's been friends
with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and Venezuelan demagogue Hugo
Chavez. But now he says he's changed.</LD>
<LD>   Can this socialist who says he has reinvented himself be trusted
to govern the largest country in South America? Brazilians seem to
believe he can, and they had better be right because his success
matters -- not just to 170 million Brazilians but to other countries
in the region and to the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's 1994 economic crisis reverberated throughout the
hemisphere -- the so-called "tequila effect." Argentina's more recent
economic woes spurred milder troubles across South America -- the
"tango effect." If Brazil's economy goes south, with its $240-billion
debt, the "samba effect" will create financial havoc worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the debt, outgoing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso did
a good job. He established a free-market economy in Brazil and his
tight fiscal discipline reduced inflation to less than 10% from an
absurd percentage ranging into the thousands. On his watch, new
health programs significantly drove down infant mortality. He made
progress in education, and even though the country's economy did not
grow, poverty was diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Lula has campaigned on the promise of change but has not been
specific about how he would change Brazil. Let's hope he knows by now
that going back to a pre-Cardoso era of protected markets, state
monopolies and government-managed industries wouldn't help.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lula should try to get close to the United States. He
needs to stay away from the populist temptation to spend money and
should abandon any immediate plans to raise wages, lower domestic
taxes or impose higher import tariffs. Without strict fiscal
discipline, inflation would once again spiral and everyone in Brazil
-- especially the poor -- would be hurt. To inspire trust in the
international financial markets, it is also imperative that Lula
choose competent, internationally recognized economists for his
fiscal and financial team, people who would help him devise plans to
jump into free-trade agreements that could help increase the
country's exports.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should take a prudent but friendly
approach to Lula and seek an early meeting. That would signal to the
international financial community that Washington would cooperate
with the formerly bombastic socialist Lula.</TE>

<LD>This is an "off-year election" because there is no presidential
contest. But it's a busy year for California voters, who will pick
their governor and elect seven other statewide officials.</LD>
<LD>   Among those running are three incumbents who have served ably and
deserve reelection. They are Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides.</LD>
<LD>   In the four open offices, here are The Times' endorsements:</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Bill Jones has been one of the best secretaries of state
in modern times. He was termed out of office, however. As his
successor, The Times endorses Kevin Shelley of San Francisco, who has
been in the Assembly since 1996. Shelley, who was Assembly majority
leader, has sponsored legislation to improve the state's voting
system and was the author of a bond issue to help counties pay for
new voting machines.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley gets the nod over former Assemblyman Keith Olberg of
Victorville, who has some good ideas about improving voter
participation but had an undistinguished record during his six years
in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Controller</TE>
<TE>   Our choice is Steve Westly of Atherton, a dot-com executive who
taught at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and led economic
development for the city of San Jose. As do all candidates for this
office, he promises to audit state functions to weed out waste. It
will be even more important to work with the Legislature and the
governor to get the state's fiscal house in order and to stabilize
the state's credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks was a bright and
articulate member of the Assembly for 14 years and the Senate for the
last two. McClintock promises to be a fiscal watchdog, but his zeal
to oppose just about anything connected to spending money -- a
reality of running any large organization -- would probably gum up
the orderly workings of state government.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Commissioner</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are John Garamendi of Mokelumne Hill and Gary
Mendoza of Sierra Madre. Garamendi became the first elected state
insurance commissioner in 1991 but left after that term to
unsuccessfully run for governor. Later he was deputy secretary of the
Interior in the Clinton administration. Garamendi has the experience
to take firm control of this office as soon as he is sworn in. Voters
should elect Garamendi to continue the job of straightening out the
mess created by Chuck Quackenbush, forced to resign because of
political scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, a budding star for the GOP, is a former state
corporations commissioner with some fresh and interesting ideas and
some achievements in dealing with health insurance and HMO issues as
corporations chief. But Garamendi's experience tips the scale in his
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. of Public Instruction</TE>
<TE>   The Times endorsed state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo)
for this nonpartisan office before the March primary and restates
that endorsement now.</TE>
<TE>   A few words about the incumbents and their challengers:</TE>
<TE>   Lieutenant Governor</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), a moderate, is the
standout figure on the GOP ticket. It's too bad he isn't running for
one of the less competitive statewide offices.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz Bustamante has done a credible job in this office of little
visibility or daily effect on government. And the former Assembly
speaker is respected as one of the ranking Latinos in American
politics. He's earned a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney General</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Bill Lockyer, former president pro tem of the state
Senate, has been an activist as the state's chief law officer and top
lawyer. He has prosecuted abusive nursing homes, reestablished the
office's environmental law section and moved to shut down
methamphetamine laboratories. He too deserves a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Locker's foe, Sen. Dick Ackerman, from Irvine, is best known for
his habit of voting no on almost every bill coming before the Senate,
even those sponsored by his GOP colleagues. Such a negative approach
is not what California needs in an attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Phil Angelides of Sacramento is the Energizer Bunny of
state government, helping to finance California's budget deficit one
day and fighting corporate fraud the next. He has proposed creative
and economically responsible ways to invest the state's money in
California rather than in other states or countries.</TE>
<TE>   Opponent Greg Conlon of Redwood City was on the state Public
Utilities Commission when it was less responsive to consumer
interests than it should have been. Angelides is the clear choice for
another term.</TE>

<HD>Assessing Carter's Work and the Nobel Peace Prize</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Former President Carter Wins Nobel Peace Prize," Oct. 12: How
wonderful that former President Jimmy Carter has been honored with
the Nobel Peace Prize for his untiring work internationally to create
peace through negotiations, mediation and the Carter Center -- not to
mention his work with Habitat for Humanity.</LD>
<LD>   And he is recognized worldwide for his consistent belief that
foreign policy must be grounded in human rights. Not just rhetoric,
but a passion for justice.</LD>
<LD>   Carter received the award at the same time that President Bush
received congressional approval to go to war against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Interesting timing, interesting contrast: making peace and making
war.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a prize for war-makers?</TE>
<TE>   Lenore Navarro</TE>
<TE>   Dowling</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame that Carter won a prize that was once held in high
regard. He deserves better, but since Yasser Arafat won it, it has
diminished in stature and respect.</TE>
<TE>   The Nobel Prize committee should rescind Arafat's award and
restore the peace prize to the standards and honor it enjoyed in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Marantz</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've never been enamored of the Carters, but Rosalyn deserves the
Nobel Peace Prize just as much as Jimmy does.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert S. Bahn</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The credibility of the Nobel organization must now be held in
question as a result of its decision to honor Carter. Carter's failed
presidency does not deserve the recognition it bestows on him.</TE>
<TE>   His administration's dark period in America's foreign policy
overshadows any lasting accomplishments that Carter may have
produced. Let's not forget Carter's policy of neglect in Iran,
allowing Americans to be kidnapped and held hostage for months. How
about the Carter administration's wrongheaded policy of saddling up
with the brutal dictator Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, betraying every
fundamental principle of American democracy?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Carter has had some laudable accomplishments since his
departure from government and, for those, I thank him. Unfortunately,
none of them warrant the peace prize.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Miles</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the day after the U.S. Congress gave President Bush the green
light to wage the war on Iraq that he has dedicated his presidency
to, it was refreshing to hear that Carter has been awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. The committee in Oslo also sent a message to Bush that
it is not pleased with his constant beating of the war drums. It
pointed out that negotiation through the U.N. is the honorable
approach to all world problems.</TE>
<TE>   The award points out the numerous times that Carter employed
negotiations successfully in many areas of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Carter is not only a true man of peace, he is a humanitarian
beyond comparison with any who have occupied the Oval Office. Thank
God for Jimmy Carter and thanks to Oslo for its recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Wilt</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the Nobel committee gets this year's award for
hypocrisy. In announcing the decision to give Carter the award, he
stated it was a deliberate slap at Bush. I wonder if the chairman
comprehends the irony of intentionally creating controversy over a
peace prize.</TE>

<HD>Slate Mailers Turn Politics Into Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Spotlight Is Cast on Paid Endorsements" (Oct. 11) hits the nail
right on the head. As any candidate for office or elected official
knows, money is the "mother's milk" of a successful campaign, and
slate mailers can spell the difference between victory and defeat.</LD>
<LD>   When I first ran for office (L.A. County assessor) in 1990, I was
inexperienced in the political arena. In large part, slate mailers
and political tabloids on which I paid to be included contributed to
my victory. Certainly, having the name Kenneth Hahn helped as well.
One tabloid put out by a U.S. congressman featured me (for a price)
and displayed a photo with both Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and then-City
Atty. James K. Hahn with the caption, "Carrying on in the Hahn
tradition."</LD>
<LD>   In subsequent reelection campaigns, the money I raised went mainly
to buying as many slate mailers as my campaign manager could lock me
into. And federal and local politicians issued a good number of
these. It didn't matter about my political affiliation; I bought
slates attributed to Democrats and Republicans as well as
organizations -- and they worked! After all, not many voters knew
about the county assessor, and others just didn't care. Nonetheless,
my name was on mailers and they went to a high percentage of the
electorate. I got a lot of "bang for my buck" and was reelected twice
more.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks to Bill Simon, I now have a new, foolproof voting strategy
for election day. I will make it a point to vote for candidates who
had enough integrity not to pay big bucks for a spot on the dreaded
California Organization of Police and Sheriffs endorsement mailer.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Davis Appointees Give $12 Million to Campaign," Oct. 13: Why
would anyone be surprised at the connection between political
contributions and Gov. Gray Davis' appointments of those individuals
to commissions and state boards? The entire state of California is
"for sale" to well-heeled Democratic supporters. And corruption on a
major scale is certain to follow as our one-party state breeds total
arrogance in these Democratic political leaders.</TE>

<LD>There are 19 candidates for judicial offices on my sample ballot.
Only one of them has provided any voter information in the sample
ballot. I looked on the Web and found a little information, but it
was not enough to enable me to distinguish one candidate from the
others. Judges are important.</LD>
<LD>   Where can voters find the kind of information they need, such as a
record of the kinds of decisions they have made, for those who are
already judges, or which groups support them, for those who are not?
In the absence of such information, voters are reduced to falling
back on the tiny bit of information that is provided, such as gender
and ethnicity as it can be deduced from surnames. This is not a good
basis for making important decisions.</LD>

My ballot has 19 votes for judicial candidates for which there was
only one candidate. The ballot said: "Vote yes or no for each
office." For the 19 judicial candidates I will vote no. I do not like
the one-candidate system.</TE>

The Times' eagle masthead; however, please don't overlook the fact

That is indeed the most important quality a newspaper can symbolize:
the pen is mightier than the sword.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has embarked on the most
ambitious and most needed school construction project in its history.
Ronit Weiss' assessment of the need for Measure K is misinformed
(letter, Oct. 11).</LD>
<LD>   Through the first phase of its construction program, the LAUSD is
building 80 new schools, expanding 79 existing campuses and
completing 12,500 school repair projects. But this is not enough. In
order to give every child the opportunity to attend a quality school
in his or her own neighborhood, the LAUSD has to build thousands of
additional classroom seats, which is why the Board of Education has
placed Measure K, the school repair and construction bond, on the
Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Measure K will allow the district to complete its ongoing
neighborhood school building program as well as add approximately
35,000 classroom seats for children -- the equivalent of
approximately 40 additional neighborhood schools.</LD>

<LD>Re "Plutonic Love Fades," editorial, Oct. 12: In order to decide
whether Pluto and the recently discovered Quaoar should be called
planets, it is helpful, amusingly enough, to follow the approach of
the father in the movie "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" who was always
coming up with Greek etymologies for words. The term "planet" comes
from the Greek word meaning wanderer, which was used in order to
distinguish the then-known planets, which looked like stars, from the
stars themselves, which seemed to be fixed in the heavens. Because
the planets were observed to be constantly changing their position
against the background of the so-called fixed stars -- indeed, their
paths even performed loops due to their apparent retrograde motion
(which we now recognize as due to the relative motion of Earth and
planet) -- the term "wanderer" seemed appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   With regard to Pluto and Quaoar, there is nothing in the term
"wanderer" that pertains to size. There can be little wanderers as
well as big wanderers, as any parent with little children will tell
you. Thus, from an etymological standpoint, Pluto and Quaoar, as well
as the asteroids, and the so-called Kuiper Belt objects, are all
planets, all wanderers, but just of smaller size than the more
prominent wanderers that we customarily call the planets.</LD>

<HD>Ahmanson Opponents Get Boost</HD>
<DH>Gore, Kennedy intensify national spotlight on controversial
Ventura County development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Al Gore and environmental leader Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. personally lobbied a Ventura County supervisor this week
over the proposed 3,500-home Ahmanson Ranch project -- an unusual
intervention that demonstrates a growing level of national interest
in the debate over preserving the rolling grasslands west of the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Gore and Kennedy joined an opposition that already includes a host
of Hollywood celebrities, underscoring the ability of movie director
Rob Reiner to bring high-profile politicians and celebrities into the
fight.</LD>
<LD>   Reiner, a leading Democratic activist and fund-raiser, formed a
group last year to champion the preservation of 2,800-acre Ahmanson
Ranch, the largest remaining parcel of privately owned open space
bordering the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings and loan, plans to
build a $2-billion golf course community on the ranch of oak savanna
and grassy plains.</TE>
<TE>   "We were obviously thrilled that Al Gore was willing to weigh in
on this project," said Chad Griffin, a Reiner spokesman. "I can only
say that the other side has a team of lobbyists and lawyers who are
being paid for their services and these national leaders have not
been paid a dime."</TE>
<TE>   But a Washington Mutual spokesman said the developer has no
intention of backing away from the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as an excellent project that deserves to be
approved," said spokesman Tim McGarry. "We believe that when all is
said and done, it will be."</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmanson Ranch project was approved by Ventura County
supervisors in 1992. However, years of litigation by opponents and
the discovery in 1999 of the endangered red-legged frog and white
spineflower on the property have delayed construction.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, entered the fray on Monday by calling John Flynn, chairman
of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, urging him to block a
procedural move aimed at speeding up the environmental review of the
project.</TE>
<TE>   The speed of the environmental review is crucial because of an
impending change in the makeup of the Board of Supervisors. A critic
of the project, Linda Parks of Thousand Oaks, will join the board in
January. She will replace Supervisor Frank Schillo, who has voiced
support for it.</TE>
<TE>   Gore phoned Flynn on Tuesday morning as Flynn sat on the dais in
the supervisors' hearing room, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a shock to be receiving a call from him, actually," Flynn
said of Gore's call, which he said was brief.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said both Gore and Kennedy asked him to follow the
supervisors' normal review process for a project. He denied that
either influenced his decision to pull the proposal to speed the
project from the supervisors' agenda, effectively killing it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had already made up my mind," Flynn said. "This is such a
heated issue that we probably should not try to change the process."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels had proposed that board members sit with
Ventura County's Planning Commission to hear public comments in the
environmental study. Mikels also requested that any comments made to
the Planning Commission not be repeated at a second hearing before
the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn pulled her aside during a meeting break early Tuesday,
Mikels said, to ask her to withdraw her motion. She declined, but
said she would not fight Flynn's withdrawal of the item.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not a happy camper," said Mikels, who supports the project.
"The opposition put so much pressure on, and they decided to go ugly
instead of listening to reason."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Beth Postman, assistant to Kennedy, confirmed that he called
Flynn. She said the Natural Resources Defense Council has opposed the
Ahmanson project for years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the group's Santa Barbara chapter asked Kennedy to
make the call and he complied, the Kennedy spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jano Cabrera, a Gore spokesman, said that Gore called Flynn to
"help preserve pristine open space in California."</TE>
<TE>   By making the call, Cabrera said Gore "joined not only the Sierra
Club [and] the Natural Resources Defense Council, but also a large
coalition which recognizes the value of this pristine area."</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera said several people and organizations opposed to Ahmanson
had been writing Gore about the issue for some time. Cabrera said
Gore received a number of phone calls about Ahmanson on Tuesday, but
he did not know specifically who had asked Gore to call Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the anti-Ahmanson campaign said Reiner called
Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner's group, Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, seized on the delay
to raise new questions about whether the project should be built,
pointing to detrimental effects to the environment and on local
freeways already clogged with traffic.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, a growing number of high-profile politicians,
many of them in Los Angeles County, have come out against the
project.</TE>
<TE>   That high-level opposition has raised the stakes for the five
Ventura County supervisors, who will vote on the new environmental
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   If supervisors reject the study, it could force Washington Mutual
to abandon the project, opponents say, or at least agree to sell the
property, possibly to a conservation group.</TE>

<HD>Judge Will Make Call in Ball Battle</HD>
<DH>Trial starts in two men's dispute over who caught Barry
Bonds' record 73rd homer in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Who owns No. 73?</LD>
<LD>   Is it the Berkeley restaurant owner who first gloved it, or the
Sacramento engineer who emerged from the heap shyly clutching the
record-breaking home-run ball?</LD>
<LD>   The civil trial to determine who has "unequivocal dominion and
control" over the spheroid knocked into the stands last season by San
Francisco Giant Barry Bonds opened here Tuesday with an exchange of
brushback pitches by opposing lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   In what promises to be a colorful two- to three-week trial before
a judge who professes to know little about the American pastime, the
two sides have produced lineups of witnesses ranging from a retired
major league umpire to a man who viewed the Oct. 7, 2001, scramble
for the ball from a kayak in the cove outside Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   The relevant legal precedents, both teams agree, lie in 19th
Century "wild animal" and whaling law. Does the baseball, like a
disputed fox in an 1805 New York Supreme Court case, belong to the
hunter who stalked it or the neighbor who killed it? Does the
valuable whale -- or Rawlings cowhide baseball, in this case -- go to
the first to harpoon (catch) it or, the one who brings it under
control?</TE>
<TE>   The answers to these questions will help Superior Court Judge
Kevin McCarthy, a baseball neophyte who says he has never been to Pac
Bell Park, decide who liberates the baseball from the dark safe
deposit box where it now resides in Milpitas, a city south of
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   After three failed attempts to settle the baseball dispute before
mediators, the court action began Tuesday with a flurry of pretrial
motions filed just as a wave of baseball ecstasy swept San Francisco.
On Monday, the hometown Giants clinched the National League pennant
and won a berth in the World Series against the Anaheim Angels.</TE>
<TE>   As lawyers marched into court in the disputed-ball case, newspaper
vendors hawked the San Francisco Chronicle with a bold headline
proclaiming: "Sweet!" In a nod to the 1951 call by announcer Russ
Hodges when Bobby Thomson won the pennant for the New York Giants
with a home run, the rival Examiner carried the headline: "The Giants
Win the Pennant! The Giants Win the Pennant! The Giants Win the
Pennant!"</TE>
<TE>   It provided a stark, upbeat contrast to the dreary litigation on
display Tuesday in the San Francisco courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   In one motion filed Tuesday, attorneys for Alex Popov -- the
38-year-old restaurant owner who briefly snared the Bonds home-run
ball, valued by collectors at $1 million, before losing it in the
resulting melee -- asked the judge to prevent a veteran umpire from
testifying.</TE>
<TE>   In a pretrial declaration, 28-year major league umpire Jim Evans,
called as a defense witness, invoked "The Official Baseball Rules" to
contest Popov's claim that he caught the ball. A video of the home
run, Evans said, showed that "the pocket of [Popov's] glove is still
open, and the ball appears loose."</TE>
<TE>   In baseball argot, Evans said Popov "snow-coned" the ball. Adding
a criticism familiar to any Little League veteran, Evans chided Popov
for not using two hands to catch the ball. Popov's attorneys argued
that umpires and official baseball field rules have no place in the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "When is the last time you saw an umpire in the stands breaking up
a fight?" asked Popov attorney Martin Triano.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Patrick Hayashi, the 37-year-old computer engineer
who ended up with the ball, asked the judge to ban the other side
from saying "catch" or "caught" to describe what Popov did when the
ball arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Hayashi attorney Donald K. Tamaki said his side will introduce
scientific testimony proving that Popov did not hold the ball long
enough to constitute possession. Key to the case is a videotape of
the disputed catch by NBC cameraman Josh Keppel.</TE>
<TE>   The video sequence shows Popov's glove rising from the crowd with
the ball wedged loosely in the pocket as he brings it down. What it
does not show, contends Tamaki, is the ball falling from Popov's mitt
and bouncing several times on the concrete floor. That scene, Tamaki
said, was witnessed by one of the kayakers who float in McCovey Cove
outside the ballpark during Giant games.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial footage of the ball in flight, the video shows a
dog pile in the open arcade area overlooking the diamond on one side
and San Francisco Bay on the other. Minutes later, a smiling Hayashi
pops up, showing the baseball to the camera and those around him.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, according to Hayashi, Popov turned to him and
said, "You've got it! Yeah! Dude!"</TE>
<TE>   For Popov, who denies congratulating Hayashi, it is a question of
civilized behavior versus the "law of the jungle."</TE>
<TE>   Popov, who traded in a $40 field-level ticket for a
standing-room-only pass on the right field arcade that day, says in
his lawsuit that he was "assaulted and battered" in the clump of
crazed fans.</TE>
<TE>   "This has really turned into a moral argument," said Popov, an
imposing 6-footer. "It's about appropriate behavior. If you follow
their argument it's: Women and children beware."</TE>
<TE>   Popov's attorneys say they will produce a witness claiming to have
seen Hayashi -- 5-foot-5, 155 pounds -- elbowing and grabbing at the
larger Popov.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of all the talk about assault and barbaric behavior,
Hayashi said, "That's just not in my character." He has demanded a
formal apology from Popov. One thing is certain, said baseball law
expert Paul Finkelman, no matter what happens in the courtroom, the
ball does not belong to the man who hit it.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry Bonds committed an act of battery on that ball," said
Finkelman, a University of Tulsa law professor who has been called to
testify. "He did everything he could to make that ball go as far away
as he could."</TE>

<HD>Debris-Filled Sand to Be Removed</HD>

<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday called for the immediate
removal of thousands of cubic yards of dirt and sand that was mixed
with construction debris and dumped on Will Rogers State Beach last
month as part of a county-approved sand replenishment project.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors have complained strenuously about the project, which
officials with the county's Department of Beaches and Harbors
defended as a routine attempt to add sand to an eroded beach. The
4,000 cubic yards of material came from a Playa del Rey development
site and included large chunks of ragged concrete, brick and glass.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an outrage," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday.
"Sand replenishment is about replenishing sand with sand, not sand
with construction debris."</LD>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky made a motion directing county staff to tell the Playa
del Rey developer to cart the sand away. It passed unanimously.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, Westport Playa Sol, would not comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   County workers have been trying to pick the chunks of debris from
the sand since residents began complaining about it in late
September.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Beaches and Harbors previously said that once
the chunks were out, the rest eventually would become sand.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, officials would not reiterate that position. "The
supervisors have told us to take the material off the beach, and
we're just going to comply with that," said Kerry Gottleib, chief
deputy director of the department.</TE>

<HD>Wife Killer Receives Life Sentence for Strangulation,
Dismemberment</HD>
<DH>'I've lost the woman I loved most,' says the Panorama City
man, who was convicted of first-degree murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Panorama City tile setter convicted of first-degree murder for
strangling his wife, cutting her body up and dumping her remains off
the Ventura County coast was sentenced Tuesday to life in state
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo, 38, apologized for his crime during a sentencing
hearing in Ventura County Superior Court. He told the judge: "I've
lost more than anyone. I've lost the woman I loved most and I've lost
my life."</LD>
<LD>   Castillo told the judge he never meant to kill his wife, Deputy
Dist. Atty. Chris Harmon said. But the prosecutor argued that the
defendant was a coward who had shown no genuine remorse.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo was arrested Dec. 6 after a Ventura County sheriff's
deputy stopped to investigate an illegally parked truck on Pacific
Coast Highway near Mugu Rock and saw that he was splattered with
blood.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo told the officer he had a cut arm and had stopped to
dispose of a cat he had run over. But deputies shining lights on the
water saw human limbs floating in the surf.</TE>
<TE>   The victim was later identified as Maria Pinaloza Ambario, 34, a
Pacoima factory worker and Castillo's wife of two years.</TE>
<TE>   At the couple's apartment, detectives found a bow saw, plastic
sheeting, knives and Ambario's heart in the garbage disposal.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, defense attorney Doug Daily did not dispute that
Castillo had killed his wife. But he argued there was no evidence of
premeditation to support a finding of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Herbert Curtis III, who decided the case after Castillo
waived his right to a jury trial, disagreed. He ruled that brain
hemorrhages found during an autopsy showed that Castillo choked
Ambario for several minutes--enough time to form a deliberate intent
to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo will be eligible for parole after 25 years.</TE>

<HD>Education Is Put in Hands of Teenagers</HD>
<DH>Youths in Palmdale are given Palm Pilots to help with
assignments. But some researchers say gadgets won't improve student
performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zera Sanford holds her education in the palm of her hand--with a Palm
Pilot.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a technology experiment, Highland High School in
Palmdale gave her and 31 other students hand-held computers to keep
track of homework, download research material and complete classroom
assignments. They are part of a growing national trend at high
schools to use similar devices, the size of a calculator with a 2 1/2
inch-by-2 inch screen.</LD>
<LD>   With a pencil-sized pointer, users can write on the screen or tap
on it to open programs and issue commands. At close range, messages
can be beamed from one hand-held computer to the next, much like a
wireless pager. The computers can store textbooks, even though some
say the screens are too small to read.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not just an expensive notebook," Sanford said while beaming
a message to a friend. "I don't see why anybody would pass the
opportunity to use one of these."</TE>
<TE>   School spending on hand-held computers, whether Palm Pilots,
Handsprings or other brands, is predicted to increase from $5 million
during the 2000-01 school year to $310 million by 2005-06, according
to a study by International Data Corp., a market research company.</TE>
<TE>   Hand-held computers cost as little as $99 and are considered a
less fussy option to lap-tops, which generally cost more than $1,000.
Highland's hand-held program cost $4,000 for 35 devices and was paid
for by the Antelope Valley Union High School District's educational
technology office.</TE>
<TE>   "The way you get productivity out of technology is when it's
ubiquitous," said Elliot Soloway, a professor at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor who has developed educational software for the
hand-held computers.</TE>
<TE>   "Education changed when every kid was given a paper book," he
said. "Education will change again when every kid has a computer, and
the only way to do that is with a hand-held computer" because of its
low cost.</TE>
<TE>   At Highland High, the Palm Pilots are being tested on students in
Spanish teacher Jim Trumps' class. The instructor has the
technological savvy and passion that experts say is essential to
getting new computer programs up and running. Trumps, who pitched the
hand-held computer idea to the school district, designed his own Web
site where students can check their grades and download assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with lap-tops is students have to carry them from
class to class and they already have 70 pounds of books ... ," Trumps
said. "But kids don't mind holding Palm Pilots. You can do most of
the work on a hand-held that you would do on a lap-top."</TE>
<TE>   The Antelope Valley district has had a lap-top program for five
years. Currently, 600 of the district's 20,000 students carry
lap-tops they own or borrow from the schools. Kent Tamsen, director
of educational technology, said the Palm Pilots might replace
lap-tops, but a study first must determine the effects both
technologies have on student achievement.</TE>
<TE>   In the four weeks since Trumps distributed the hand-held computers
for students to keep for the school year, he's had them draw a comic
strip on the device with dialogue in Spanish. He's beamed questions
and answers for quizzes. And every day the children plug their Palm
Pilots to a platform connected to a desk-top computer that downloads
media Web sites and study guides.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been reading a lot more," said 14-year-old Danielle Edwards.
"When I'm bored, I study my Spanish vocabulary [on the Palm Pilot]. I
also never used to check the news and weather, but now I do it all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   But some researchers say the technology is doomed to disappoint
because not enough teachers will be properly trained to use the
devices. They warn that some schools have spent lavishly on
technology in the past -- such as on educational television --
without ever showing higher achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers "are hardly given any technical assistance and
professional help to integrate the technology into daily classes,"
said Larry Cuban, professor emeritus of education at Stanford
University and author of "Oversold and Underused: Computers in the
Classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Educational psychologist Jane M. Healy , the author of "Failure to
Connect--How Computers Affect Our Children's Minds," questioned
whether the hand-helds would improve children's behavior. She said
hiring qualified teachers and reinvigorating marginalized programs
such as the arts and athletics are "far more important than an
electronic toy."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Inc., which manufactures the devices used by Trumps' class,
says it holds 82% of the education market. Since 2000, the Milpitas,
Calif.-based company has given out $2.3 million worth of the
equipment to learn more about how to market the product. Though not
at Highland, the hand-held computers have been given to schools in
Berkeley and Lennox, Calif., as well as to schools in New Jersey,
West Virginia and Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lorion, vice president of education at the company, said
teachers can use the Palm Pilot to see what class a student wandering
the hallways should be in. Teachers can follow text displayed on a
hand-held being read aloud by a student and highlight words that were
mispronounced. Instantly, the child has a note of what needs
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bob Moore, vice chairman of the Consortium of School
Networking, a Washington, D.C., organization that promotes computer
technology in schools, thinks the computer that works best for
students will have to be a happy medium between a hand-held and a
lap-top.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a promising technology," he said of hand-helds. "The one
thing I'm concerned with is the small screen. How usable is it? It's
good for calendars and contacts, but how useful is it for kids and
teachers?"</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, students have found their own uses for the devices.</TE>
<TE>   Though this has not happened in Trumps' classroom, stories abound
about students elsewhere downloading software that enables them to
switch on and off televisions and power VCRs to the dismay of
unsuspecting teachers. They download games such as "Dope Wars," a
strategy game in which the player must outsell computer opponents in
make-believe drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Trumps warns his students that if he finds one of them playing
games in his or another teacher's class, he'll take the device away.</TE>
<TE>   The computers also have created a social fabric. One of Trumps'
first assignments was for the class to exchange phone numbers.
Students who never spoke to each other before now call each other
several times a week to gossip and talk about schoolwork.</TE>
<TE>   "We're more organized," said 14-year-old Clarrisa Camacho. "We're
learning new stuff while communicating with each other."</TE>

<HD>State Plans to Renovate, Rent Crystal Cove Cottages</HD>
<DH>Beach colony homes, which were to have been part of a
pricey O.C. resort, will go for $100 a night in 2004. Coastal
Commission must approve the idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The historic cottages at Crystal Cove State Park would be restored to
their 1920s luster and opened to the public at discount prices under
a plan unveiled Tuesday by the state Parks Department.</LD>
<LD>   The cottages, once destined to become part of an upscale resort,
will offer the public ocean views and seclusion for $100 a night.
Some will be converted into dormitory-style houses whose rooms will
cost $20 to $30 per night.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not going to be a luxury experience," said Mike Tope,
Orange Coast district superintendent for the state Parks Department.
"This is going to be a very rustic Crystal Cove experience."</LD>
<TE>   Officials said they hope to re-create the bohemian culture that
existed at Crystal Cove before World War II, including creating
facilities for artists. Twenty to 25 of the 46 cottages -- forming
one of the last intact beach colonies in Southern California -- will
be prepared for summer 2004 rental.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hailed the plan, saying it's far better than
earlier plans to make the cottages the center of a four-star resort
that would include a restaurant, pool and other amenities. Rooms at
the resort would have cost $375 a night.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very challenging process for state parks by trying
to balance public access with resource protection, and trying to
respond to the community," said Laura Davick of the Alliance to Save
Crystal Cove, who applauded the plan. "They should be commended for
what they have put together."</TE>
<TE>   That rustic experience, however, will be unique along the coast
for its affordability and views. "There's nothing else like this in
Southern California," Tope said.</TE>
<TE>   The cottages, between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach, have been
the subject of a long battle. They have been largely vacant since the
longtime tenants who rented them from the state were evicted in July
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some families had rented inexpensive cottages for several
generations, affording them a coveted lifestyle in one of
California's most picturesque locales.</TE>
<TE>   The state evicted them so it could repair the cottages and tie
them into the rest of Crystal Cove State Park.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the project will come from several sources. The Parks
Department received a $2.8-million contribution from the California
Coastal Commission. Gov. Gray Davis set aside an additional $9
million from Proposition 40, the voter-approved bond measure that
funneled $2.6 billion into park projects and environmental
initiatives across the state.</TE>
<TE>   The Parks Department said the price for the first phase of the
improvements will be nearly $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has to be approved by the Coastal Commission, but because
its purpose is affordable public access, proponents say they are
optimistic about quick consent.</TE>

<HD>State Plans to Renovate, Rent Historic Crystal Cove
Cottages</HD>
<DH>Beach colony homes, which were to have been part of a
pricey resort, will go for $100 a night in 2004. Formal approval is
still needed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The historic cottages at Crystal Cove State Park would be restored to
their 1920s luster and opened to the public at discount prices under
a plan unveiled Tuesday by the state Parks Department.</LD>
<LD>   The cottages, once destined to become part of an upscale resort,
will offer the public ocean views and seclusion for $100 a night.
Some will be converted into dormitory-style houses whose rooms will
cost $20 to $30 per night.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not going to be a luxury experience," said Mike Tope,
Orange Coast district superintendent for the state Parks Department.
"This is going to be a very rustic Crystal Cove experience."</LD>
<TE>   Officials said they hope to re-create the bohemian culture that
existed at Crystal Cove before World War II, including creating
facilities for artists.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty to 25 of the 46 cottages -- forming one of the last intact
beach colonies in Southern California -- will be prepared for summer
2004 rental.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hailed the plan, saying it's far better than
earlier plans to make the cottages the center of a four-star resort
that would include a restaurant, pool and other amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms at the resort would have cost $375 a night.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very challenging process for state parks by trying
to balance public access with resource protection, and trying to
respond to the community," said Laura Davick of the Alliance to Save
Crystal Cove, who applauded the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be commended for what they have put together."</TE>
<TE>   That rustic experience, however, will be unique along the coast
for its affordability and views. "There's nothing else like this in
Southern California," Tope said.</TE>
<TE>   The cottages, between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach, have been
the subject of a long battle.</TE>
<TE>   They have been largely vacant since the longtime tenants who
rented them from the state were evicted in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some families had rented the inexpensive cottages for several
generations, which afforded them a coveted lifestyle in one of
California's most picturesque locales.</TE>
<TE>   The state evicted them so it could repair the cottages and tie
them into the rest of Crystal Cove State Park.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the project will come from several sources. The Parks
Department received a $2.8-million contribution from the California
Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis set aside an additional $9 million from
Proposition 40, the voter-approved bond measure that funneled $2.6
billion into park projects and environmental initiatives across the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The Parks Department said the price for the first phase of the
improvements will be nearly $13 million.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has to be approved by the Coastal Commission, but because
its purpose is affordable public access, proponents say they are
optimistic about quick consent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there can be no doubt that a plan that actually allows
the public much greater access to the Historic District will be
viewed favorably," by the commission said Susan Jordan, an
environmentalist with the California Costal Protection Network.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which was developed in the last year, recommends:</TE>
<TE>   Restoration of five cottages for use by state workers for
security, landscaping, research, maintenance, a lifeguard substation
and manager's residence.</TE>
<TE>   A park interpretation and education program with a visitor
orientation center, archive center, docent and park interpreter
annex, multipurpose meeting and classroom facility, Crystal Cove
house museum and underwater park education center.</TE>
<TE>   Repairing boardwalks and stairways.</TE>
<TE>   A cafe/snack bar and beach store concession.</TE>
<TE>   Parks officials emphasized that the public will still have a voice
in evaluating the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "If the public thinks they're done now, they're wrong," said Roy
Stearns, deputy director of the Parks Department. "They are a key
part of what happens from here on in."</TE>
<TE>   The public can review and comment on the plan until Dec. 2.
Printed copies of the plan and environmental impact report are
available at various locations in Southern California and Sacramento.
For a list of the locations, contact the state Parks Department at
(949) 492-0802.</TE>

<HD>Water Officials Agree to Build Prototype Desalination Plant</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Water officials in Long Beach and Los Angeles agreed Tuesday to
co-sponsor construction of a $5.3-million prototype desalination
plant capable of producing 250,000 gallons of high-quality drinking
water daily.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which will be partially funded by the U.S. Department
of Reclamation, will test a patent-pending system believed to be more
energy-efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods, said
Ryan J. Alsop, spokesman for the Long Beach Water Department.</LD>
<LD>   "If the research pans out, we will eventually build a full-scale,
10-million-gallon-per-day plant in Long Beach that could go online by
the end of the decade," Alsop said. "The goal is to bring the costs
of desalinization down to competitive levels."</LD>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said the
project could make Southern California's water less vulnerable to
drought and political battles.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 17-year-old who was apparently killed and then dragged four miles
by a car to Hacienda Heights was identified Tuesday as Gloria Gaxiola
of Baldwin Park.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's investigators said they believe Gaxiola was killed near
Turnbull Canyon Road and Skyline Drive and dragged to Colima Road and
Hacienda Boulevard. Someone saw her body early Saturday and called
the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's spokesman Richard Weston said the family initially asked
that Gaxiola's name not be released. But later it was decided to
release her name in hopes that someone with information about her
death would call the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5638 or
890-5699.</LD>

<HD>Judge Asks for More Map Data</HD>
<DH>At issue is whether Thousand Oaks properly OKd building of
three estate homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lawyer behind many of Ventura County's open space protection laws
was asked Tuesday to submit additional documents to a judge
considering whether Thousand Oaks properly authorized construction of
three estate homes on a site once planned for an equestrian center.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Francis, representing City Council candidate Michael
Farris in his lawsuit against the city, was asked by Superior Court
Judge Kent Kellegrew to provide him with more information on land-use
maps at the heart of the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Farris' lawsuit maintains city maps in use six years ago clearly
show the 8.7-acre site in question was designated as existing parks,
golf courses and open spaces. A 1996 open space preservation
ordinance requires voters' approval before such land uses can be
changed.</LD>
<TE>   The suit argues that once the Save Open Space and Agricultural
Resources-like ordinance was adopted by the council that year, it
obligated the city to adhere to the land uses outlined in its General
Plan and corresponding maps, whether those maps were correctly marked
or not.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks' attorneys argue city maps had been erroneously
color-coded for years and should have designated the Newbury Park
property south of Potrero Road only as proposed parks and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge is going to have to make a tough decision," Francis
said after the hearing Tuesday. "Whether a map with an error that was
relied upon by the voters should govern and require a public vote ...
or whether the error was enough to invalidate this dispute."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Mark Sellers told the judge that when the city's first
comprehensive General Plan was adopted in 1970, the site was
designated as low-density residential, which would have allowed as
many as 32 homes on the property.</TE>
<TE>   The land use was changed in 1988 to proposed parks and recreation
as part of the overall plan for Dos Vientos, according to the city.</TE>
<TE>   After several hours of discussing the validity of city maps, Mark
C. Allen, a lawyer for the property owner, told the judge that his
client's 1990 development agreement with the city came years before
SOAR and guaranteed its right to develop the land.</TE>

<HD>Two Deny Guilt in Hollywood Hate Assaults</HD>
<DH>Unlike another recent case, the victims were attacked
because they were assumed to be gay, prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Eric Malnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men pleaded not guilty Tuesday to hate-crime charges stemming
from separate attacks Sunday on two men in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "The motive for the crime was the victims' perceived sexual
orientation," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office. "They used a slur for 'gay' toward the men and
threatened their lives."</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office stirred controversy earlier this
month by deciding not to file hate-crime charges against three men
accused of attacking two gay men in West Hollywood with baseball
bats. In that case, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said there was no
evidence of a hate crime because the attackers made no remarks about
the victims' homosexuality.</LD>
<TE>   In the Hollywood case, Ever Wilfredo Rivera and Selvin Orlando
Campos, both 19, were arraigned Tuesday on charges of robbery and
assault with a deadly weapon. The charges carry a hate-crime
enhancement, which means the men could face up to 14 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the victims are gay is not known, the district attorney's
office said. Prosecutors said the hate-crime enhancement was added
because the attackers struck on the presumption that they were.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the attacks occurred on Lexington Avenue near
Sycamore Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, about 5:30 a.m., a 46-year-old man was struck in the
head with a baseball bat and his keys were stolen before he was able
to flee to his nearby home. About 10 minutes later, a short distance
away, a 19-year-old man was able to deflect a blow from the bat but
was cut with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera and Campos were arrested a few minutes later when Los
Angeles police stopped their vehicle on the Pasadena Freeway at
Stadium Way.</TE>
<TE>   The one victim's keys and a baseball bat were in the car, law
enforcement sources said. Rivera is being held in lieu of $185,000
bail. Bail for Campos was set at $135,000.</TE>
<TE>   The two victims, whose identities were not released, were treated
at Hollywood-area hospitals and released.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Hollywood case, Trev Broudy was attacked with a
baseball bat moments after he and a friend, Edward Ulett, hugged
goodbye Sept. 2. Ulett escaped serious injury but Broudy was
hospitalized for more than a week with serious head injuries that
left him temporarily in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker, 29, Vincent Dotson, 18, and Torwin Sessions, 19,
were arrested later on suspicion of attempted robbery, assault with a
deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery. The men have pleaded
not guilty to all the counts.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 3, Cooley angered several politicians, gay activists and
sheriff's deputies by announcing that he would not file hate-crime
charges against the three. Cooley said that his office is committed
to prosecuting hate crimes but that a review of the evidence had
shown that the motive in the West Hollywood attacks was robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn urged Cooley to
reconsider his decision in the West Hollywood case.</TE>

<LD>Begin by understanding that one mayoral candidate likes to wear a
gold-colored cardboard crown from Burger King and carries a puppet
dressed in prison garb.</LD>
<LD>   Another candidate, a former police officer who was fired for
allegedly using excessive force, has filed a defamation suit against
the mayor. He says the mayor called him a "convicted felon," which he
says he is not.</LD>
<LD>   And the mayor, seeking a fifth straight term, has responded with a
legal complaint of his own, saying he is being harassed by the former

<TE>   If it's civility voters want, Garden Grove might be a tough place
to find it. Voters in the central Orange County city are being asked
to choose among three candidates on the November ballot who, some
say, are providing more spectacle than meaningful debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very tired of it. There's just too much drama. It's like a TV
sitcom with all the political games," said resident Robert Walker,
52, who has lived in town for 25 years. "I'm waiting for Hollywood to
come down and make a comedy show of Garden Grove."</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral race is a tangle of extreme personalities who appear
to share little love for one another.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Broadwater became the mayor of Garden Grove in 1994. He has
served four straight two-year terms and is seeking to finish a full
decade as the city's top elected official. A strong advocate of
revitalization and redevelopment, he is known as "the Bulldozer" by
some, a title he now flaunts. He contends the city has flourished
during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater is being challenged by Tony Flores, a former policeman
who lost his job with the city's police force in 1988. A soccer dad
and PTA member, Flores says he is a longtime resident who has grown
disillusioned with the city's direction, particularly its aggressive
redevelopment push. Flores, a workers' compensation agent, said
Garden Grove has become overbuilt and overrun by big business.</TE>
<TE>   The third candidate is Will B. King, a flamboyant sort who
describes himself as the biggest gadfly in the nation. In 1995, King
made national headlines during the O.J. Simpson murder trial when he
was removed from the courtroom while dressed in women's clothing. He
was convicted six years ago of threatening his former wife's fiance
with a toy bomb, but the conviction was overturned. Listed on the
ballot as Will B. King, he also goes by William Beckingham.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to sorting out the mayoral contest, voters in Garden
Grove will be asked to choose among five candidates seeking two
council seats.</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral candidates avoid one another when possible. Other
times they've yelled, exchanged snide remarks and hurled insults at
one another, observers say. At one candidates debate, King tossed
around a puppet effigy of the mayor in prison clothes and called his
opponents "maggots."</TE>
<TE>   While King has injected an unpredictable quality into the race,
it's the bitterness between Broadwater and Flores that has caught the
attention of those who follow city politics.</TE>
<TE>   Flores filed a defamation lawsuit against Broadwater in late
August, alleging the mayor called him "a felon" during a private City
Hall meeting with a constituent who had wanted Flores to attend the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater countersued Flores last month, seeking to have Flores'
suit dismissed and his attorneys fees paid.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater denies he called Flores a felon. Instead, the mayor
states in his lawsuit that he said Flores is "as close to being a
felon without being one." He is seeking an Oct. 31 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Wearisome voters say the mudslinging has gotten worse and needs to
stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to remind myself: Let's stick to the issue, let's stick to
the issue," said Verla Lambert, 65. "I think there's too many
distractions with all the bad blood between the men. When you're
slinging mud back and forth, that doesn't help voters. We're not
voting for who slings the most mud against the other. Just stick to
the issues."</TE>

<LD>Begin by understanding that one mayoral candidate likes to wear a
gold-colored cardboard crown from Burger King and carries a puppet
dressed in prison garb.</LD>
<LD>   Another candidate, a former police officer who was fired for
allegedly using excessive force, has filed a defamation suit against
the mayor. He says the mayor called him a "convicted felon," which he
says he is not.</LD>

legal complaint of his own, saying he is being harassed by the former
policeman, whom he calls "one of the most negative human beings I

<HD>Russell Izor, 79; Salty Sportfishing Skipper Backed
Artificial Reefs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell A. Izor, the developer of the braided Space Age fiber fishing
line he dubbed "Izorline," colorful sportfishing boat captain,
conservationist and occasional thorn in the side of the California
Department of Fish and Game, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Izor died Saturday in Long Beach of pancreatic cancer. He had
lived for many years in Torrance.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran angler caught fish heavier than he was as a
10-year-old boy on the Hermosa Beach Pier and, in about 45 years on
the water, estimated he had caught more than 2 tons of game fish.</LD>
<TE>   By the 1970s, he was experienced enough to develop his own line of
fishing tackle, including Izorline, and founded Izorline
International in Gardena. He sold the company in 1993, but remained a
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   His lightweight braided fishing line was the first to employ
Spectra, a trade name of Allied Chemical for its gel-spun
polyethylene fiber that is also used to make bulletproof vests.</TE>
<TE>   The line became known for its strength, durability and lack of
stretch, and proved useful in catching big-game fish such as tuna and
yellowtail.</TE>
<TE>   Izor built and skippered seven boats for parties of
sportfishermen, from the 36-foot Longfin he launched in 1949 to the
93-foot First String he completed in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Operating out of San Pedro, Long Beach and other Southern
California ports, he became so popular with anglers for his knack for
finding fish that he was asked to write columns for fishing
publications, including Western Outdoor News.</TE>
<TE>   He also had regular radio segments, such as his Friday appearances
for a time on KMPC's Robert W. Morgan show to predict which fish
might be available on a given weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to anglers, he also worked for fishery development and
conservation, particularly in building artificial reefs near Long
Beach and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Department of Fish and Game told The Times that the
Long Beach reef Izor instigated was the most productive fish reef of
about three dozen man-made ones along the California coast. The
department named it Izor Reef.</TE>
<TE>   "It has not only provided an amazing amount of recreational
fishing for people from Newport Beach to San Pedro," Izor told The
Times in 1994, "but it has also provided a habitat for big families
of fish who were wandering in a void. A fishery needs a place to hang
their hat like anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Izor's relationship with the Department of Fish and Game, however,
had not always been so cozy.</TE>
<TE>   As a popular skipper, he railed against regulations governing the
sportfishing industry and the department's methods of enforcing them.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, he had the Northrop Rod and Gun Club aboard,
catching tuna off Catalina, when Fish and Game wardens tried to board
his boat to check the anglers' licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them they did not have the constitutional right to board
our boat, were interfering with my ability to earn a living, and
pushed their boat off with the boat hook, " Izor said.</TE>
<TE>   The wardens accused Izor of attacking them with the boat hook. He
had to post $1,000 bail in Avalon to keep from being arrested -- at
the time, the highest bail ever set for a fish and game violation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so stinking idealistic that I went before a judge instead
of a jury, sure that without probable cause to search my boat, the
judge would have to rule I could not be invaded," Izor told The Times
in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "But they saw me as a threat to the system," he said, "and I was
found not guilty of assault, but fined $250 for resisting an officer,
and told to behave."</TE>
<TE>   At the request of the Department of Fish and Game, the Coast Guard
also put Izor on probation for six months on the grounds that his
actions might have endangered his passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Anglers chuckled for years about the episode, and the sudden
appearance afterward of signs at area landing sites reading, "Game
Wardens and Dogs Keep Off the Docks." Izor denied any knowledge of
the signs, but appeared regularly at Fish and Game Commission
meetings to voice displeasure with various regulations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to helping to create artificial reefs offshore, Izor
also worked to restore kelp beds off Catalina and the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Izor is survived by his wife, Lura Kuhlman; three daughters,
Lorry, Kristen and Caryl Anne; and one granddaughter.</TE>

<HD>LAX Will Sell Ads to Defray Higher Costs of Security</HD>
<DH>The facility barred them for 42 years, viewing them as a
distraction to passengers. Revenue of $31 million a year is
projected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To offset mounting security costs and lost revenue from concession
and parking fees following the terrorist attacks, officials plan to
allow advertising at Los Angeles International Airport for the first
time in the facility's 42-year history.</LD>
<LD>   The city agency that operates the airport expects travelers to see
advertisements hanging from terminal ceilings and affixed to
concourse walls next summer. The program, patterned after successful
campaigns at Las Vegas-McCarran International and other airports, is
projected to raise about $31 million a year for the airport agency.
The airport's total estimated revenue this year is $790 million.</LD>
<LD>   LAX is the only major airport in the country without an
advertising program. The world's fifth busiest airport hasn't allowed
advertising because officials believed that the money raised wouldn't
offset the inconvenience to travelers.</LD>
<TE>   "Advertising was not needed to enhance airport design and was of
no particular advantage to travelers," said William Schoenfeld, who
worked at LAX from the mid-1950s to the mid-'90s, first as an
architect who helped design the central terminal area and then as
assistant general manager for planning and engineering with the
airport agency. "We were more interested in giving passengers
information on where to go and how to make their trip comfortable
rather than purveying a product."</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. With airports facing a cash crunch in the
early '90s and again in 2000, more facilities turned to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, airport agency officials said their advertising program
will be designed so it doesn't distract from general airport
information.</TE>
<TE>   "When people get off an airplane and come into this country for
the first time, it's very important that they know how to get to
baggage claim," said Rick Janisse, deputy executive director for
properties and concessions for the airport agency. "We don't want to
do anything that's going to create a lot of visual noise."</TE>
<TE>   The city's Airport Commission voted Tuesday to authorize the
airport agency to solicit bids from companies to administer the
program. The vendor selected by the commission will be charged with
selling ad space, designing and reviewing ads to ensure that they
comply with city standards, and installing and maintaining them.</TE>
<TE>   The airport's nine terminals could accommodate 467 ads in
ticketing lobbies, concourse hallways and baggage claim areas,
Janisse said. The airport agency is talking with airlines that lease
passenger waiting areas from the city to see whether they are
interested in allowing ads there.</TE>
<TE>   Other airports with advertising programs said they have been a
successful revenue source.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program has been particularly helpful in augmenting our
airport operating budget considering the impact of 9/11 on the
aviation industry," said Hilarie S. Grey, public affairs manager for
the Clark County Department of Aviation, which operates Las
Vegas-McCarran International Airport. "Advertising and concession
revenue have definitely played a role in helping our airport to
offset new security expenditures incurred over the past year."</TE>
<TE>   McCarran's program raises about $9 million a year for the airport
-- the world's 11th busiest. The facility's campaign has won several
industry awards.</TE>

<HD>Horace Logan, 86; Created Radio's 'Louisiana Hayride'
Country and Western Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Horace Lee "Hoss" Logan, founder of the influential "Louisiana
Hayride" that created country singing stars in the 1950s and
originator of the catch-phrase "Elvis has left the building," has
died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Logan, who had pancreatitis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome, died Sunday in Victoria, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The radio impresario landed on KWKH-AM in Shreveport, La., in 1932
when he was only 16 but already had a voice so deep and impressive
that he won a contest to become an announcer. Logan hit his stride in
1948 when he launched the station's "Louisiana Hayride," which he
staged before a live audience in Shreveport's Municipal Auditorium.</LD>
<TE>   The innovative three-hour Saturday night show, broadcast over CBS
to 191 stations across 13 states in the South, was considered an
upstart rival to the staid Grand Ole Opry of Nashville. Unlike the
Opry, which required a hit record before a performer could be on the
show, Logan encouraged newcomers, requiring only production of a
record. He also encouraged experimentation and permitted amplified
guitars and other newfangled instruments banned by the traditional
Opry.</TE>
<TE>   When the Opry fired troubled Hank Williams for drinking, Logan
hired him. When the Opry told a teenage Elvis Presley to stick to
truck-driving, Logan gave him a break. The experiences with the two
stars provided Logan's title for his 1998 memoir, "Elvis, Hank and
Me: Making Musical History on the 'Louisiana Hayride.' "</TE>
<TE>   Others may have referred to the "Hayride" as the "Junior Grand Ole
Opry." Logan preferred to call the Opry "the Tennessee branch of the
'Hayride.' "</TE>
<TE>   The "Hayride," which lasted only a year or so after Logan left for
other radio jobs in late 1957, also gave early breaks to such country
singing legends as Kitty Wells, George Jones, Faron Young, Webb
Pierce, Johnny Cash, Slim Whitman, Willie Nelson and Jim Reeves.</TE>
<TE>   "When he [Logan] gave you an introduction, you thought the
president of the United States was coming on," Merle Kilgore, who had
appeared on "Hayride" and now manages Hank Williams Jr., told
Associated Press from his home in Paris, Tenn. "He was the greatest.
Being on the 'Hayride' ... that was as big as it got in the country
music industry."</TE>
<TE>   Logan's 1998 book of fond reminiscences about the stars he helped
launch earned generally good reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised "Elvis,
Hank and Me" as "a real foot-stompin' treat" and predicted that
"serious country-music fans will love it."</TE>
<TE>   Some historians, however, questioned Logan's accuracy on a few
points. Logan recalled, for example, that he introduced Presley when
the youth made his first "Hayride" appearance on Oct. 16, 1954. Other
students of Presley lore claim that the announcer Hank Page made the
actual introduction, although Logan and Page were on stage.</TE>
<TE>   In Logan's version, he grabbed the microphone and said: "Ladies
and gentlemen, you've never heard of this young man before, but one
day you'll be able to tell your children and grandchildren you heard
musical history made tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Logan signed the 19-year-old to a year's contract, paying him $18
for each Saturday night appearance.</TE>
<TE>   About halfway through the year, Presley's popularity had soared so
much that he paid $400 a week not to appear on "Hayride."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who first introduced Presley to the "Hayride"
audience, everyone seems to agree that it was Logan, with his
stentorian, authoritative voice, who first uttered the words, "Elvis
has left the building."</TE>
<TE>   In buying out his contract, Presley had agreed to make one final
appearance for the "Hayride" on Dec. 12, 1956. Because he had become
such a box-office draw, the performance was moved to Shreveport's
Coliseum, which held 13,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   After Presley performed and left, Logan told the Chicago Sun-Times
in 1998, "the little girls were screaming and screaming and
screaming. It was almost an act of desperation. I had to make the
announcement, 'Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore, who attended that night, said Sunday that with Logan's
"voice of authority, all of those kids shut up and believed him. Of
course, Elvis really had left the building."</TE>
<TE>   Years after Presley's death, the phrase is still in common usage
to signal that some event, program or person's tenure has come to an
end.</TE>
<TE>   After Logan left the Shreveport station and the "Hayride," he
worked in California and Florida and spent a decade in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, producing the "Big D Jamboree," where he
showcased Willie Nelson in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Logan, who is survived by his wife, Linda, retired to Seadrift,
Texas, in 1995.</TE>

<HD>Bustamante Makes Most of Post in Davis' Shadow</HD>
<DH>Seeking second term as lieutenant governor, he is
criticized by GOP rival Bruce McPherson as 'invisible.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Over the past four years, Cruz Bustamante has gamely embraced the
Golden Rule of Lieutenant Governors: Grab the limelight whenever you
can, even if it means issuing press releases when you give blood or
hand out Thanksgiving turkeys.</LD>
<LD>   Being lieutenant governor will do that to a politician.</LD>
<LD>   It's a thankless job, shorn of the governor's power and perks and
scorned by pundits and other politicians. A steppingstone, perhaps?
Graveyard might be more accurate. Only two sitting lieutenant
governors in the past 120 years have been elected governor: Democrat
Gray Davis in 1998 and Republican C.C. Young in 1926.</LD>
<TE>   "You're not in the spotlight, except occasional moments," said
Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC
Berkeley. "You're not in control of any money or department. It's the
state equivalent of the vice presidency, with many of the same
issues. It can be a frustrating office."</TE>
<TE>   Four years after becoming the first Latino since 1871 to win a
statewide election in California, Bustamante is shrugging off those
frustrations and seeking a second term as lieutenant governor on Nov.
5. His campaign is seen by many Democrats as a tune-up for a 2006 run
for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante, 49, a self-effacing former Assembly speaker, doesn't
deny he's interested in seeking the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination -- assuming he wins in November, he emphasizes.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to continue working on the things we've started," said
Bustamante. "I want to be able to help people."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Bustamante was seen as vulnerable. The
self-described "plodder" is dismissed by some Democrats as deficient
in charisma and campaign fund-raising skills.</TE>
<TE>   His chief challenger, Republican state Sen. Bruce McPherson of
Santa Cruz -- a moderate who has managed to get elected to the
Legislature in one of the state's most liberal areas -- was viewed by
analysts as the GOP's best chance of winning a statewide race this
year. But McPherson, 58, has been hampered by a lack of money to make
his case with voters who don't know him or his reputation. Thus far,
he hasn't been able to transform his local appeal to Democrats and
independents into statewide support.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know McPherson from a hole in the wall," said Cain.
"This is a classic case of not having the money to get the message
out there."</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times poll conducted the last week of September
showed Bustamante holding a comfortable 52% to 31% lead over
McPherson among likely voters, with 16% undecided. Other candidates
on the ballot are Jim King, American Independent; Donna J. Warren,
Green; Pat Wright, Libertarian; Kalee Przybylak, Natural Law; and
Paul Jerry Hanosh, Reform.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, with the race heading into the home stretch,
McPherson has gone on the offensive. He has attacked Bustamante as a
lazy seat-warmer who has wasted taxpayer money. He has singled out
for criticism Bustamante's attendance record at University of
California and California State University board meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I describe him as the invisible [lieutenant] governor," said
McPherson. "I think it's an indication of his lack of enthusiasm for
the job."</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante shakes his head at these charges, and fires back with a
few of his own. His aides have compiled a 50-page analysis of
McPherson's missed Senate votes. The back-and-forth over missed votes
and meetings may matter little to most voters, who pay scant
attention to "down-ballot" races such as that for lieutenant
governor, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for the politically attuned, the debate is shining a rare
spotlight on the duties of a lieutenant governor and on the
difficulties of maintaining a meaningful profile in a job that can be
a political black hole, experts and politicians say.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante took office four years ago amid a wave of Latino
euphoria over his historic victory. His aim was to reach beyond his
prescribed duties as lieutenant governor, which are largely confined
to sitting on a network of state boards and commissions. Bustamante
said he has accomplished that goal by "thinking out of the box" and
launching his own statewide initiatives on breast-cancer awareness,
racial tolerance and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Humble Beginnings</TE>
<TE>   By Bustamante's own account, he's the political equivalent of a
pack mule, plodding steadily forward toward the finish line. It's a
defining trait he learned growing up as the son of a barber in the
small Central Valley town of San Joaquin, where he worked in the
fields and studied to be a butcher before a summer internship in his
local congressman's office in Washington, D.C., set him on a path to
politics and public service, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante makes light of his lack of flashiness. His humble,
self-deprecating style has endeared him to fellow politicians and
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante has stamped his style onto his standard campaign
speech. In one version, he tells students and other constituents:
"Remember, if you ever think something -- even college -- is beyond
your reach, just think of me. Your perfect role model. I am short,
overweight and losing my hair. If I can become lieutenant governor of
the state of California, there is nothing that you can't do."</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante said he has tried to make access to education a central
issue of his first term. He has championed development of a 10th UC
campus at Merced, in his native Central Valley. And he has traveled
the state to promote Cal Grants for college-bound students.</TE>
<TE>   Like other politicians, he's also been quick to tap into anger
over the day's burning issues. Last year, for example, he attempted
to position himself at the forefront of public outrage over the
energy crisis by filing a lawsuit against energy companies on behalf
of state taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   In the mold of previous lieutenant governors, Bustamante has
jumped at the chance to savor his fleeting powers as "acting
governor" when Davis has left the state, ordering flags lowered to
half-staff to honor deceased politicians and police officers, and
declaring emergency areas in fire-ravaged counties. Perhaps with an
eye on a future statewide race, he has shrewdly cultivated key
Democratic constituencies as lieutenant governor, strengthening ties
with Latinos, unions and environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   He has been an election-season favorite of Native American tribes
awash in casino profits and, in turn, has been a leading tribal
advocate in Sacramento. Two years ago, when he created a lieutenant
governor's Woman of the Year award, he named Mary Ann Martin Andreas
-- then-chairwoman of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians -- as the
first recipient.</TE>
<TE>   When Bustamante took office four years ago, it marked the first
time since 1974 that a lieutenant governor and governor from the same
party had been elected. Davis and Bustamante pledged to work as
partners. But their relationship deteriorated three months into their
terms in a dispute over Davis' decision to seek federal mediation in
a legal challenge to Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure
curtailing social services for illegal immigrants, which was approved
by 60% of California voters.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante said his criticism of Davis was born of "principle and
conscience."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Bustamante sums up his relationship in terse fashion.
"He's an independent person -- and so am I," he said in an interview
in his Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson can't match Bustamante when it comes to the incumbent's
compelling personal story. The Republican candidate grew up in
relative privilege in Santa Cruz, where his family owned the local
newspaper. Writing newspaper editorials for 10 years whetted his
appetite for politics and honed his views, and the next logical step
was a run for the Assembly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But McPherson's story took a tragically poignant turn last
November, when his 27-year-old son, Hunter, was shot to death during
a robbery on a San Francisco street. McPherson quietly refers to the
murder as "a setback in our family situation."</TE>
<TE>   Why Rival's Running</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate said he is running for lieutenant
governor for two fundamental reasons: It's a job that plays to his
strengths and interests, and it's an opportunity to give Californians
a chance to elect a moderate Republican.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson embraces the label, which he said is defined by his
support for abortion rights, gun control, environmental protection
and public education. He counts several education initiatives as his
proudest legislative achievements, including bills limiting class
sizes, expanding the Cal Grant program, and strengthening technical
education opportunities for high school graduates who don't go on to
college.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're lieutenant governor and you do the job you're
supposed to do, you can really have an impact on education, in
particular as the regent of UC or trustee of the CSU system," he
said. "You can have an impact on our preservation of natural
resources being on the state lands commission. You can have a strong
influence on economic development and job creation as chairman of the
economic development commission. Those are the things that interest
me."</TE>
<TE>   McPherson said the job of lieutenant governor will take on even
greater importance over the next four years if Davis runs for
president. Republicans and many Democrats "would rather have Bruce
McPherson than Cruz Bustamante be the acting governor," he contends.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson is hanging his election hopes on the possibility that
many voters will reluctantly vote for Davis over struggling
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr., and then try to
balance their decision by voting for a Republican lieutenant
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge when you have an incumbent Democrat who's a
Latino for an opponent," said McPherson. "I've been told so many
times I can't win, and I'm here, four elections and nine years later,
to say you can."</TE>

<HD>Board Presses Sheriff for Explanation</HD>
<DH>County supervisors react to report that 800 claims of
misconduct by deputies were not probed by department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday demanded an explanation of why
the Sheriff's Department failed to investigate more than 800 claims
of wrongdoing by its deputies.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors also are seeking a legal opinion on whether deputies
found to have engaged in misconduct as long ago as 1993 could still
be disciplined today.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure of the failure to investigate was made in a report
from the Office of Independent Review, a group of civil rights
attorneys who investigate the Sheriff's Department and report to
county supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   The report is slated to be formally released Thursday, but
supervisors have a preliminary version, which found that the
Sheriff's Department failed to routinely review legal claims of
misconduct. The agency has now changed its policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were always under the perception that the department had a
handle on this vital issue," Supervisor Mike Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   State law gives police agencies one year from the time they hear
about possible officer misconduct to discipline those in question.
The one exception, attorneys said, is when the officers are named in
lawsuits and any swift discipline could be used against them in
court. After the Office of Independent Review found a failure to
review claims, the department began reviewing those filed since
January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In his motion, which will be voted on next week, Antonovich asked
that county lawyers study the limitations on discipline, including
whether information more than a year old can be placed in deputies'
personnel file. He also wants the Sheriff's Department to explain how
legal claims could go unexamined for so long. "There was a
breakdown," he said, "and I would like to know why and who is
responsible for not following policy."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors and their aides also raised concerns about the
relationship between the Office of Independent Review and Sheriff Lee
Baca, who proposed it. The head of the office, former federal civil
rights prosecutor Michael Gennaco, meets weekly with Baca, but his
new report is the first he has given to the supervisors in the year
since they unanimously created the office.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina, who is Baca's sharpest critic on the
board, has asked for her own weekly meetings with Gennaco.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too cozy," she said of the relationship between Gennaco and
the sheriff, echoing private remarks by several supervisors' aides
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point in time," said Miguel Santana, Molina's spokesman,
"it looks like the sheriff has a closer relationship with Mr. Gennaco
than the board does."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the supervisors and sheriff have been
increasingly tense. The board has clashed with Baca over department
cost overruns and whether he properly disciplined deputies who were
involved in the death of a mentally ill jail inmate.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday they spent more than an hour criticizing the sheriff's
purchasing policy.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Gennaco said he wants to increase his
communication with supervisors. He said state public meetings law
made it hard to brief the entire board on personnel meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a history of dealing with the sheriff that I don't," he
said of the board. "I think it is important for us to hear from them
what their issues are."</TE>

<HD>214-Home Project Approved</HD>
<DH>Ventura City Council allows the development near the
Montalvo shopping center, saying high-density growth is the reality
after SOAR.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite angry protests from neighbors, the Ventura City Council has
approved construction of 214 homes on a long-vacant parcel of land
near the county Government Center.</LD>
<LD>   Voter approval in 1995 of an anti-sprawl initiative has forced the
land-poor city to use every available acre to its fullest, council
members said Monday before unanimously approving the development
behind the new Montalvo Square Shopping Center on Victoria Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the beginning of what it will be like," Councilman Sandy
Smith said. "We're looking at densities in the downtown area of up to
56 units per acre. That's the realities of the SOAR initiative. We're
growing inward versus outward."</LD>
<TE>   The plan would put 120 single-family homes, a 94-unit condominium
complex for seniors and a three-acre park on 26 acres. The
single-family homes are expected to sell for about $450,000 and up.</TE>
<TE>   Developer John Ashkar of Los Angeles also told council members
that he would amend his plan to add 10 condominiums designated for
low- to moderate-income seniors.</TE>
<TE>   City planners have anticipated allowing a mixed-use development in
the area for more than 20 years, but no developer had stepped forward
until Ashkar presented his plan in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Council members praised the project design and said the
development would complete a master plan for the Montalvo area.</TE>
<TE>   "This project really does a good job of incorporating the
commercial, retail and housing elements, probably more so than any
project we've done in the city," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But a handful of nearby residents opposed the development, saying
it would cram too many homes into the area and would increase
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   John Tunigold told the City Council that he had tried to develop
his 1 1/2-acre parcel along Hill Road five years ago, but was told
that his plan to build six units per acre was too dense. "And now
this developer is asking to stuff 13 units per acre? That's way too
many," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers questioned the development's effect on neighborhood
schools and police and worried that increased traffic on side streets
would pose a danger to children.</TE>
<TE>   "We just spent millions of tax dollars opening up that
Victoria-101 interchange, and now you're talking about adding 400
more cars to that small neighborhood," Michele Harer said. "You're
going to be adding a tremendous number of cars to that congested
Victoria area, and I worry about the impact on that neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Ashkar defended his project, pointing out that he planned to build
an average of eight units per acre, less than the maximum 23 units
per acre that the city's master plan would have allowed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he told council members that he had discussed the
project with police and school administrators and vowed that the
development would not hinder services in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Council members said such high-density projects will likely become
more common as the city struggles to find ways to deal with
population growth while adhering to the development limitations
imposed by the SOAR initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "We embraced the SOAR restrictions, and that has implications for
our city," Councilman Neal Andrews said. "We must also be willing to
contemplate higher densities and accept some of the trade-offs that
come with that."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Cohen, a representative for Ashkar, said construction
probably will begin in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Woman Disguised Murder as Suicide, Prosecutor Says</HD>
<DH>A toxicologist accused of poisoning her husband and making
death look self-inflicted starts trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A young toxicologist accused of poisoning her husband staged a crime
scene to make his murder appear a suicide, complete with fake entries
in her diary, rose petals strewn across his body and a shredded love
note from her boss, prosecutors alleged Tuesday in the trial's
opening arguments.</LD>
<LD>   Kristin Rossum, 25, who worked at the San Diego County medical
examiner's office at the time of her husband's death, was determined
to continue having an affair with her boss, conceal her drug habit
and make sure she and her lover both kept their jobs, prosecutor Dan
Goldstein argued.</LD>
<LD>   All three priorities were in jeopardy, he said, because Rossum's
husband, Greg de Villers, 26, had recently discovered the affair and
her renewed drug use, Goldstein said.</LD>
<TE>   Rossum told detectives that De Villers made an ultimatum shortly
before his death that she either quit her job or he would tell her
supervisors of her drug use, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Rossum was obsessed with the popular movie "American
Beauty," in which rose petals were a central theme. She complained
that De Villers rarely gave her roses. She and her boss, Michael
Robertson, often exchanged them, along with passionate e-mails
expressing their desire to be lifelong partners, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minutes of a nearly four-hour presentation, Goldstein
held up a single red rose in front of the jury, just like the one he
said Rossum bought in order to sprinkle its petals across De Villers'
body hours after she administered a fatal dose of Fentanyl, a drug
considered 100 times more powerful than heroin. Grocery store records
prove she bought the flower the day her husband died -- Nov. 6, 2000,
Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was out of control," Goldstein said. "The numerous lies and
the staged crime scene the defendant went through in this case are
tantamount to a confession."</TE>
<TE>   As he described the scene, Rossum quietly wept and scribbled quick
notes to her lawyer. She often shook her head at what she was
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Alex Loebig, spoke for just 45 minutes, saying
Rossum herself will refute much of what prosecutors presented Tuesday
when she testifies during what is expected to be a four-week trial.</TE>
<TE>   Loebig said De Villers' death was a suicide. He was despondent
over his crumbling marriage and had begun drinking heavily shortly
before he took his life, Loebig said.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum was the woman he intended to be with for the rest of his
life, Loebig said. The two had met five years earlier in Tijuana. It
was "love at first sight on Greg's part," Loebig said. De Villers
helped Rossum kick a drug habit and was intent on getting married
from early in their relationship. Rossum, however, had doubts, Loebig
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a desire that never waned in Greg to get married and to
show everyone what he had, a beautiful young wife," Loebig said. "It
wasn't too long after the wedding that Kristin determined that maybe
Greg wasn't the soul mate for her."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson has returned to his native Australia and will not
testify in the trial, Goldstein said. But according to the
prosecution theory, he played a key role in Rossum's crime.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, the former chief toxicologist at the medical examiner's
office, not only helped Rossum conceal their affair, he helped her
cover up the murder and her addiction to methamphetamine, Goldstein
said. Robertson has not been charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum and De Villers had been married less than a year when she
began the affair with Robertson, Goldstein said. Before their affair,
she also had brief affairs with at least two other co-workers, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   She had also started using drugs again, he said, including
methamphetamine that she obtained from her office. A pipe used to
smoke meth, with saliva that tested positive for Rossum's DNA, was
found in her desk drawer, Goldstein said. She stole the meth and
other drugs, including the one that killed De Villers, from the lab,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But she worked hard to keep anyone from learning of her drug use,
he said. Rossum, an "affable, affluent, articulate" daughter of two
college professors, wanted to conceal her true identity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Loebig argued that Rossum's drug use has been exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   A month after De Villers' death, Rossum was fired from her job
when her drug use became public. Robertson also was fired because he
did not notify anyone of her drug problem.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum was arrested in June 2001. She was released on a
$1.25-million bond last January. She faces a maximum sentence of life
without the possibility of parole, after prosecutors opted not to
seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge John M. Thompson has imposed a gag order on
the participants and has banned cameras from the courtroom.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Homes Are Criticized</HD>
<DH>Study finds most in the state fail to meet federal
standards. Industry officials see some flaws in report. State
launches effort to upgrade care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than three-quarters of California nursing homes fail to meet
federal standards, and more than four in 10 homes violate a state law
mandating minimum nurse-staffing levels, according to a comprehensive
review of the state's nursing-home quality.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-month study by the nonpartisan California HealthCare
Foundation also found tremendous instability in the work force:
Nearly eight in 10 nursing staff members left their jobs from 2000 to
2001.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the foundation has launched a Web site that
provides detailed information on all 1,406 nursing homes in the
state. The site, www.calnhs.org, compares their performance on
specific measures (such as nursing staff turnover) by assigning
stars, with one star representing the worst homes and three the best.</LD>
<TE>   Taken together, the study and the Web site represent the most
ambitious effort in California to measure the quality of nursing
homes and to spur improvement. Before now, information on such homes
was limited, scattered and sometimes left families choosing
haphazardly.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised that things weren't better than they were," said
lead researcher Charlene Harrington of UC San Francisco's School of
Nursing. "We just found a lot of quality problems in the nursing
homes. It's really pretty depressing."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation review arrives amid a broad push for greater
accountability from nursing homes, which house more than 100,000
Californians and generate $5.6 billion in revenue each year.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has sought to penalize problem
homes, filing 131 criminal complaints in the past fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of care in many of our state's nursing home
facilities is reaching a level of crisis," said Collin Wong, director
of the Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse within the attorney
general's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The same corporate culture and ethics that led to Enron, Worldcom
and Arthur Andersen's demise is no less present in the corporations
that own and operate our nursing homes."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, hours after the foundation released its report, state
health officials announced their own three-step program to improve
nursing-home care. The plan involves expansion of a statewide
consumer assistance center, increased monitoring of nursing homes and
higher financial penalties for violations.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services will
launch a nationwide quality initiative, paying for full-page
newspaper ads to publicize how the largest nursing homes in each
region score on such measures as controlling patient pain and
preventing bedsores.</TE>
<TE>   "If you fly into L.A., you can find the best hotel to stay in or
the best hamburger joint, but you can't find the best nursing home,"
said Tom Scully, the agency's administrator. "It's irrational to me
that there's no consumer information" on nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the campaign by Scully's agency is to pay regional
consultants to help nursing homes improve, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said the foundation's report and Web site are
useful overall. But they said it's unfair to view a home as
problematic just because it doesn't comply with every federal
standard. A home can be cited for a serious deficiency if a tissue is
left on the floor or if the water temperature is off by 2 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the public would define 'serious deficiencies' the
way inspectors do," said Betsy Hite, public affairs director of the
California Assn. of Health Facilities. "I'm not sure we're really
giving the consumer an actual idea of the quality of care in a home."</TE>
<TE>   Hite also took issue with the foundation's conclusion that about
44% of homes are in violation of the state's minimum nursing staff
standards, which call for residents to receive at least 3.2 hours of
attention per day on average. Because of a severe nursing shortage,
it took some homes extra time to comply with the regulation, which
took effect in January 2000 and wasn't enforced until April of that
year.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say the best way to judge a home is by visiting
it, talking with the administrator and taking a tour.</TE>
<TE>   But Gwen McDonough, 62, said there is only so much one can tell
from a visit. Her family visited Canoga Care Center in Canoga Park
before moving her late husband, Joseph, there in 1998. The nurses
looked sharp. There was no foul odor. She checked her husband in.</TE>
<TE>   "They tell you to look for a place where the nurses seem
professional and nice and the hallways don't smell of urine," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph McDonough soon developed severe sores and an infection
because his bed was too small for his 6-foot 2 frame, the family's
lawyer said. The back of his ankles rubbed against the particle board
at the foot of the bed, causing wounds that went to the bone--an
injury that required a long hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   After McDonough died of pneumonia at home, the family sued the
center, alleging that it provided poor care, and settled for $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   The home's lawyer said it settled to avoid the expense and risk of
a trial. "The law is stacked against nursing homes," said downtown
attorney Vincent D'Angelo, who represented the nursing home. "The
risk is so great of a really sensitive jury, and a runaway jury
verdict for the patient is sometimes certain. It makes settlement
almost mandatory."</TE>
<TE>   According to the California HealthCare Foundation's new Web site,
inspectors found 22 federal deficiencies at Canoga Park during
2001-02, some deemed "serious" and one "very serious."</TE>
<TE>   That's worse than the state average of 14. They also recorded 12
state citations but levied no financial penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the foundation report culled statistics from nine
public databases, including inspections and financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation found that nonprofit homes devoted more staff
attention to each patient and had far fewer deficiencies than
for-profit competitors. In addition, hospital-based nursing
facilities performed better than free-standing ones.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also found that better staffing generally meant
better care.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing homes that reported 4.1 hours of care per resident per day
provided significantly better services, including feeding assistance,
helping residents out of bed and incontinence care.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors at 30 randomly selected homes found that residents did
not receive as much care as their charts indicated; staff members
overreported the number of times they turned patients to prevent
bedsores, helped them eat and helped them use the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of staffing limitations, nursing aides chart that things
happen more consistently than they actually do," said John Schnelle,
a UCLA medical school professor who worked on the project.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Schnelle said he wouldn't put a relative in a California
nursing home, if he could avoid it. "I think it's really
problematic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's effort, though the most thorough so far, has
limitations, some experts say. The Web site, for example, doesn't
measure quality of life and satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long history of experimenting with various kinds of
report cards in the health business, and the history is very dismal,"
said Dr. Robert Kane, a University of Minnesota School of Public
Health professor of long-term care and aging. "I don't think that
simply raising people's anxieties about the quality of care is the
same thing as improving it."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site also lacks some publicly available information. It
does not include convictions or prosecutions against nursing homes,
nor does it allow consumers to request the top-performing nursing
homes in each category.</TE>
<TE>   And it does not include details of each deficiency, instead using
the generic and sometimes bureaucratic language.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Orchard Gables Convalescent Hospital in Hollywood is
listed with no deficiencies or citations by state health inspectors.
But the home's former owner last year pleaded guilty to embezzling
money from a resident, and she was sentenced to electronic monitoring
and ordered to pay a fine. The nursing home has since changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a work in progress," said Ann Monroe of the
foundation's quality initiative, which she directs. "What we're
trying to do is give people more information than they had before on
making such an important decision."</TE>

<TE>   Facts and Resources</TE>
<TE>   The California HealthCare Foundation released a comprehensive
study Tuesday of the state's 1,406 nursing homes. Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * About 44% of the nursing homes in California did not meet the
state's minimum nurse-staffing standards in 2000-01. The standards
call for each resident to receive 3.2 hours of nurse attention per
day.</TE>
<TE>   * Nursing homes had an average nursing staff turnover rate of 78%.</TE>
<TE>   * Only 23% of nursing homes were in full or substantial compliance
with federal regulations governing their operations. An additional
62% had serious deficiencies, 12% very serious deficiencies, and 3%
gave "substandard care."</TE>
<TE>   * Nonprofit homes had higher staffing levels and fewer
deficiencies than their for-profit counterparts. Hospital-based
nursing facilities similarly performed better than free-standing
homes.</TE>

<LD>Two men have been arrested after leading Huntington Beach police on
high-speed chases, officials said Tuesday. Randy Herbert Dukes, 40,
of Anaheim and Thanh Duy Le, 35, of Fountain Valley are being held at
the Huntington Beach City Jail in separate incidents.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach Police Lt. Bruce Kelly said officers began
pursuing Dukes shortly before 8 p.m. Monday because he was driving a
stolen car and failed to stop when ordered to do so. The pursuit
reached speeds of 90 mph. Dukes, who is on parole, is being held on
suspicion of evading police, assault with a deadly weapon and auto
theft, among other charges.</LD>
<LD>   About two hours later, police arrested Le after he led police on a
chase to Newport Beach then back to Huntington Beach. Police had
tried to stop him because he had no license plates on his vehicle,
but he sped toward an officer, Kelly said.</LD>
<TE>   Police fired at least four shots at Le, who was not injured. He is
being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, evading
arrest and driving drunk.</TE>

<KH>Steve Harvey ONLY IN L.A.</KH>
<HD>In This World Series Matchup, 'Southern L.A.' Will Take On
'West Oakland'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has Giants manager Dusty Baker fired up Orange County or what? As his
team prepared to meet the Anaheim Angels in the World Series, Baker
said: "Our focus is 'Beat L.A.' " Then he compounded the insult by
saying of Anaheim: "It's Southern L.A." I was reminded of the time
that Bob Dole praised the "Brooklyn Dodgers" for a victory during the
1996 presidential campaign.</LD>
<LD>   One irritated Orange County resident, speaking for his region,
asked KSPN-AM (1110) radio host Todd Donoho: "Are we that lowly?"</LD>
<LD>   I don't mind if Baker refers to Anaheim as Southern L.A. I've
always thought of San Francisco as West Oakland, anyway.</LD>
<TE>   In Baker's defense: The Angels did play in L.A. for two years
before moving to Anaheim after the 1964 season. Even in Orange
County, they were called the "California Angels" for years because
team officials apparently feared no one else in the nation had heard
of Anaheim (except, possibly, those few folks who had visited
Disneyland).</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Gets No Respect -- the Early Years: The city was part of
L.A. County until Orange County was created in 1889. The folks in
Anaheim, Santa Ana and Fullerton complained at the time that they
were being ignored by L.A. City Hall (sound familiar, Valley
secessionists?).</TE>
<TE>   The book, "A Hundred Years of Yesterdays," said that one of the
reasons Orange County seceded was that the area's only rolled fire
hose was kept in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Back to Northern L.A.: "I knew that some people considered
Angelenos to be plastic, but who could have guessed this?" wrote Tony
Gleeson, enclosing a shot of a shop window in Glendale (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Not an entirely hairy situation: A while back, this column showed
a 19th century snapshot of the "LAPD Strong Men" group, which
participated in boxing, wrestling and weightlifting competitions. I
noted that the big men also had big mustaches.</TE>
<TE>   But a reader pointed out that the police officer in the first row,
far right, was clean-shaven (see partial photo) and offered a theory
as to why: "My late brother, a policeman in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, once
showed me a picture of the CR police force, circa early 1900s, with
the same [exception]."</TE>
<TE>   The explanation was that the "youngest man on the force could not
wear a mustache."</TE>
<TE>   It's that time of year: With Halloween approaching, Ed Foran of
Santa Monica sent along a shot of a party shop's frightening jumpers
(see photo), while Diana Van Horn of Fountain Valley came upon the
novel idea of making your wrinkles go away by saying "boo" to them
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: In the 1994 movie "Angels in the Outfield," about a
heaven-sent helper who turns the Angels into winners, many of the
shots of the team's home games were actually shot in Oakland. Sorry
about that, Anaheim.</TE>

<HD>That's Mr. Rally Monkey to You</HD>

<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read the paragraph in Tuesday's San Francisco Examiner, and my
blood began boiling. I flung my coffee cup halfway across the room,
inadvertently splattering several colleagues. The nerve of this John
Crowley guy:</LD>
<LD>   "It's not official," Mr. Crowley writes, "but the rally monkey is
reportedly headed the way of the spotted owl -- sharing a branch on
the endangered species list. I'm sure the stuffed primates are a
heartwarming concept in Orange County, a place more homogenized than
a glass of milk, but thankfully it's an idea whose time never will
come in cosmopolitan San Francisco."</LD>
<LD>   Oh, where to start?</LD>
<TE>   Is there any real point in responding to someone who doesn't
understand the power of the Rally Monkey?</TE>
<TE>   Or who would disrespect the Monkey by dismissively referring to it
as a "stuffed primate"?</TE>
<TE>   Why not just call Goofy a "flop-eared canine"?</TE>
<TE>   And let's not even dwell on the fact that Mr. Crowley doesn't know
that "Rally Monkey" is always spelled with capital letters.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's his Orange County reference -- "a place more
homogenized than a glass of milk...."</TE>
<TE>   Homogenized, indeed. Has this guy, apparently some kind of sports
editor at the Examiner, studied the 2000 U.S. Census figures, which
show that Orange County's populace is 51% white, 28% Latino and 14%
Asian?</TE>
<TE>   And that fully 4% of our residents claim to be of "two or more
races"? That's right -- 4%. How's that for diversity, pal?</TE>
<TE>   The paragraph ended with a real laugher. Mr. Crowley implies that
we Orange County rubes are a cut below the sophisticates in
"cosmopolitan San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   One wonders if he has ever been to the Fun Zone on Balboa
Peninsula on a Saturday night. Methinks not.</TE>
<TE>   But now that Mr. Crowley's hometown Giants and our Anaheim Angels
are matched in the World Series, he has cast the first stone.</TE>
<TE>   In the time-honored newspaper tradition, he has thrown down the
gauntlet.</TE>
<TE>   For feud purposes, I will ignore the fact that nothing else in Mr.
Crowley's column made any reference to Orange County or Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   If it's a war of words John Crowley wants....</TE>
<TE>   I give up.</TE>
<TE>   I can't think of anything awful to say about San Francisco. At
least, nothing I'd really mean. Fact is, I love that town.</TE>
<TE>   The closest I can come to defending the faith is to lift a line
from Jack Smith, the late Los Angeles Times columnist who for years
waged a North-South battle with his counterpart Herb Caen of the San
Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   Of the San Francisco weather, Smith wrote in 1989: "It is so cold
and clammy that they don't actually get out on the beach, they sit in
their cars with the heaters on, and look at the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   On another visit, Smith spotted some attractive young women.
"These were San Francisco young. These were creatures of the city
that they imagined was the most sophisticated in the world. No harm
in thinking so."</TE>
<TE>   In later columns, Smith noted that in reality he loved San
Francisco and that Caen -- despite what he often wrote in his columns
-- had told Smith more than once that he liked Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, who could ever stay mad at the legendary Caen, who dubbed
the Golden Gate Bridge the "Car-Strangled Spanner"?</TE>
<TE>   So as for any Anaheim vs. San Francisco feud, count me out. I
tried to contact Mr. Crowley to get his take on modern-day feuds but
didn't hear back from him.</TE>
<TE>   But I'll make this prediction: By the end of the World Series, Mr.
Crowley will be dancing to the Rally Monkey's tune.</TE>

<HD>Charles Kiesler, 68; as Chancellor, He Helped Missouri
Enrollment</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Kiesler, 68, former chancellor of the University of
Missouri-Columbia who increased minority and overall enrollment but
tangled with university curators, died Friday in San Diego of
unstated causes. He had recently served as director of the Fund for
the Advancement of Psychological Sciences for the American
Psychological Society, which he helped to found.</LD>
<LD>   Kiesler became chancellor of the University of Missouri's main
campus in 1992 after seven years as provost of Vanderbilt University
in Nashville. At that time, the Columbia campus had only 97 black
freshmen and so few students that two residence halls had been
closed. Over the next four years, Kiesler created scholarships and
financial awards to attract minorities and recruited minority
students from nearby Kansas City and St. Louis. Enrollment of black
students increased 57% during his tenure, and overall enrollment
reached its highest total in five years.</LD>
<LD>   But in July 1996, the Board of Curators voted 5-4 to fire Kiesler,
accusing him of an abrasive personal style, refusal to recommend
program cuts and overspending on salaries. Kiesler said at his
ouster, "I'll admit to being gruff, [but] I've always been known as a
superb budget person."</LD>
<TE>   Born in St. Louis, Kiesler earned bachelor's and master's degrees
at Michigan State University and his doctorate at Stanford
University. He held positions as executive officer of the American
Psychological Assn. form 1975 to 1979 and as dean of the
Carnegie-Mellon University College of Humanities and Social Sciences
from 1983 to 1985.</TE>

<HD>Audrey Mestre, 28; World Champion Free Diver</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Audrey Mestre, 28, a world champion free diver, died Saturday while
attempting to break a world record in waters 81 miles east of Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic.</LD>
<LD>   Attached to a 200-pound weighted sled mounted on a steel cable,
Mestre reached 561 feet on a single breath, but apparently blacked
out, according to Carlos Serra, president of the Miami-based
International Assn. of Free Divers.</LD>
<LD>   Mestre, who was born in northern France, was attempting to break
the "no limits" dive world record of 531.5 feet, set by her husband,
Francisco "Pipin" Ferreras, in January 2000.</LD>
<TE>   In order for Mestre's dive on Saturday to be considered a record,
she needed to surface safely. The association said it will recognize
an unofficial practice attempt three days earlier in which Mestre
dived 558 feet and met all the requirements in front of judges.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Mestre broke the female world record in free
diving, no limits category, by reaching a depth of 412.5 feet in two
minutes, three seconds. Last year, she beat her own mark with a
426.5-foot dive off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Use of Pesticides Across State Reaches a Record Low for
2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pesticide use in California dropped to a record low last year, with
new regulatory restrictions, good weather and a state-sponsored push
toward less-toxic chemicals contributing to a 36-million-pound
decrease in applications.</LD>
<LD>   In a preliminary analysis to be released today, the state
Department of Pesticide Regulation reports that pesticide
applications totaled 151 million pounds in 2001, compared with 188
million pounds the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the state's top 10 agricultural-producing counties
reported decreases, including the robust Southern California farm
counties of Ventura and San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   It is the third straight year of reduced usage statewide and the
lowest total since the department began collecting such data more
than a decade ago, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Most encouraging, officials said, was a continuing trend away from
some of the most highly toxic chemicals, a range of potent pest
killers that have long been the focus of environmentalists, farm
worker groups and other advocates of reduced pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited by the fact that the numbers are showing what we
think is a good trend," Paul Helliker, the department's director,
said. "Our focus has been on helping growers find [reduced-risk]
alternatives while focusing on those chemicals that are the most
dangerous. And I think we've seen the trend go in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   California's $30-billion-a-year agricultural industry accounted
for most of the reported pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   The state's growers applied 137 million pounds of chemicals in
2001, down 35 million pounds from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Fresno County was the state's leading pesticide user,
followed by Kern, Tulare, Monterey and Madera counties. But pesticide
use dropped in each of those counties, including a 28% decrease in
Fresno County and a 22% decline in Tulare County -- the state's two
largest farm counties and among the largest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, pesticide use dropped 6% in San Diego
County and 5% in Orange County. Los Angeles and Riverside counties
reported slight increases in pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County reported the biggest decrease in Southern
California, reducing its reliance on toxic chemicals by 10%, or
724,000 pounds. The county ranked as the ninth-biggest pesticide user
in the state in 2001, down a notch from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Johnson, pesticide deputy for Ventura County's agricultural
commissioner, said county growers have for years been moving toward
less toxic remedies, such as petroleum and mineral oils, to battle
bugs and weeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our story is the story of agriculture in California in
general," Johnson said. "The move is toward more reduced-risk
material and away from the general kind of material that kills
everything."</TE>
<TE>   While applauding efforts to reduce pesticide use and find
less-toxic alternatives, anti-pesticide advocates caution that the
numbers can be deceiving.</TE>
<TE>   They note, for instance, that statewide use of the controversial
cropland fumigant methyl bromide from 2000 to 2001 was down 4 million
pounds, or 39%. But production of methyl bromide, long targeted for
elimination because it is highly toxic and depletes the earth's ozone
layer, is being phased out and is set to be banned altogether by
2005.</TE>
<TE>   That has sparked a scramble to find alternatives. And in some
cases, growers have simply switched to other chemicals, which carry
their own concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great that the overall levels of pesticide use have
decreased," said Eric Cardenas, director of a Santa Barbara-based
health project aimed at reducing pesticide-related health risks to
farm workers and those who live near farms.</TE>
<TE>   "However, the fact remains that millions of pounds of pesticides,
some of them highly toxic, continue to be used in our agricultural
operations," Cardenas added. "And that's a concern to the many people
who work in the fields and live next to agricultural areas."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say there are several reasons for the drop in
pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   Favorable weather reduced insect problems, and the struggling
agricultural economy forced farmers to cut expenses, including those
for pesticide applications.</TE>
<TE>   The department, however, also has embarked on an aggressive
campaign to urge growers and others to move toward reduced-risk
chemicals. The state department has provided more than $8 million for
about 240 grants to support such projects.</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a result, the state cited a dramatic decrease in 2001 in
the use of chemicals suspected of causing cancer and polluting the
air and water.</TE>
<TE>   "I think many growers have realized that these are chemicals that
can be problematic," Helliker said.</TE>

<HD>Registrar Certifies South Gate Recall Petitions</HD>
<DH>Election could be set for Jan. 28. Action has been tied up
in courts as leaders mounted legal challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county registrar-recorder's office has certified recall petitions
in South Gate, setting the stage for a possible January election in
which voters will be asked if they want to oust four of their
controversial leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Conny McCormack, the registrar-recorder, said that recall
petitions containing more than 8,000 signatures were certified last
week, and that she will request a Jan. 28 election.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors must give authorization, but McCormack
said she does not expect opposition.</LD>
<TE>   The recall drive, which began last year, has been stalled for
months as the targeted leaders raised legal challenges and made moves
that triggered unprecedented intervention from state officials.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, who pushed legislation that took
electoral control out of the city's hands, applauded the registrar's
rapid certification process.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters of South Gate confront some of the most serious
allegations of official misconduct and voter intimidation I have ever
seen," Jones said in a statement. "I'm committed to making certain
that the people of South Gate can freely, fully and without
intimidation or corruption, exercise their right for recall."</TE>
<TE>   The recall proponents are trying to oust the city's perceived
political boss, Treasurer Albert Robles, and his City Council allies:
Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel and Councilwoman
Maria Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents accuse the officials of corruption, charges that the
leaders deny. Ruvalcaba, in a prepared statement, said: "I am
confident that the residents of South Gate will affirm their support
for our leadership."</TE>
<TE>   In a city in which campaigns have been marred by electoral fraud
and viciously false campaign mailers, the recall will probably spark
another round of political mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Robles and his allies say they will be watching for a
Tammany Hall-style mobilization of city resources that they fear will
be used to oppose the recall.</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, Robles' council allies have created a community
outreach department staffed with dozens of workers.</TE>
<TE>   Though city officials say the employees go door-to-door asking
residents about community needs, critics suspect the employees will
be politicking.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Tammany Hall component will be rolled out with a
vengeance," said Councilman Hector De La Torre. "The community
service officers are already stepping up their presence in the
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how many candidates will seek to challenge
the targeted officials. Citizens wanting to run for office have until
Nov. 15 to file.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a general election in March heightens the
political intrigue. Since the terms of Ruvalcaba and Benavides end in
March, any winner of the January recall election for their seats will
face another election two months later.</TE>
<TE>   The recall was tied up in the courts for much of the year after
city officials declared the petitions invalid.</TE>
<TE>   A judge later ruled that the petitions were valid, and an appeals
court upheld the decision. But the city has continued to fight the
recall. Last week, the state Supreme Court refused to hear another
appeal.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento-area law enforcement officials are concerned about a
string of home-invasion robberies targeting marijuana gardens, but
they say the robberies aren't unusual.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, four gunmen dressed as FBI and federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents forced their way into a rural
Lotus home and took 20 plants, which the owner said were for
medicinal purposes.</LD>
<LD>   In North Highlands, five robbers barged into a mobile home last
month and assaulted a man before stealing about 20 plants, sheriff's
investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's Det. Dan Minter said such robberies occur every year,

"stifling regulations" and "crippling taxes."</LD>
<LD>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said Simon was "turning a blind eye
to the facts when it comes to the governor's record."</LD>

<HD>Park Chief's Transfer Routine, Official Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Park Service official who removed Tim Setnicka as
superintendent of Channel Islands National Park said Tuesday that his
decision was based solely on the needs of the agency and not on any
controversies kicked up during Setnicka's tenure.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be an overstatement and an exaggeration to say anything
else was going on here," said Arthur Eck, deputy regional director in
Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Transferring managers is common in the park service, he said. In
the last 12 months, a third of all park managers have been moved.</LD>
<TE>   "The park service believes that making adjustments in leadership
from time to time is an effective way to improve leadership of the
park. That is not saying anything negative about the last manager."</TE>
<TE>   Eck said Setnicka told him he had been working at the park for a
long time, a comment Eck took as an indication he might be ready to
move on. Setnicka was named superintendent at Channel Islands in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Setnicka, 56, who was transferred Thursday, is now in the Oakland
office, working on strategic programs.</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands National Park is made up of five islands off the
coast of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Eck acknowledged that Setnicka had a reputation for action and
blunt talk that irritated some people. But he said this style helped
him "get amazing things done" at the park.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point the park is moving into a planning phase," Eck
said. "Tim looks like a person we need in our regional office where
getting things done is a more of a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Setnicka, an Ojai Valley resident, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to designate a
900-foot spillway in Sylmar as a local historical and cultural
monument.</LD>
<LD>   The "Cascades," the terminus of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, has been
instrumental in bringing Owens Valley water to the city since 1913. A
spokesman for Councilman Alex Padilla, who made the proposal, said
the motion must now be considered by the city's Cultural Heritage
Commission on Nov. 6.</LD>

<HD>Sheriff Criticized Over Records</HD>
<DH>Supervisors order agency to comply with guidelines for
contracting and spending after a report found poor performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by the Sheriff's Department's repeated shoddy
record-keeping, Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to yank
the sheriff's contracting authority if the problems aren't fixed by
year's end.</LD>
<LD>   The department also has failed to curb a long-standing pattern of
paying for goods and services without getting the required approval
from the Internal Services Department or the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Record-keeping and monitoring by the Sheriff's Department is so
poor, supervisors complained, it is difficult to obtain the most
basic information about contract expenditures.</LD>
<TE>   "Millions and millions of dollars are contracted out every month
through this department," said Supervisor Gloria Molina, who
frequently has accused the department of wasteful spending. "They
don't audit them, they don't know where the contracts are, when they
are for, who they are for."</TE>
<TE>   Under county guidelines, most expenditures between $5,000 and
$99,999 require approval from the Internal Services Department, and
expenditures of $100,000 and more require approval by the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the problems were outlined in a June report by J. Tyler
McCauley, the county auditor-controller.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the report found that in fiscal year 2000-01,
the Sheriff's Department paid $653,000 to three vendors without the
supervisors' approval.</TE>
<TE>   In 105 cases, according to the report, Sheriff's Department
employees failed to get approval for expenditures of more than
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   In 11 other cases, the report found, payouts to vendors of more
than $5,000 were divided among multiple invoices to avoid the
approval process.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of rules that say who gets to approve spending and
how much," McCauley said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department is "not complying with the rules. It's
for expediency. They don't want to do the paperwork."</TE>
<TE>   The problem has persisted more than five years, since auditors
first recommended changes in the way the department does business.
Also for five years, the Sheriff's Department has asked the board for
more time to reform.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors rejected a recommendation by county Chief
Administrative Officer David Janssen that the department have until
February to produce a status report on a "corrective action" plan
filed earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Janssen said that shifting the sheriff's contracting authority to
another department would present "some pretty serious administrative
problems." But the supervisors vowed to do that if the department
doesn't meet a Dec. 31 deadline for complying with county guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't so violative of the way we do business in this
county, it would be funny," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul K. Tanaka, chief of the Sheriff's Department's Administrative
Services Division, said the problems are at least partly the result
of an understaffed, poorly trained department. But Tanaka said he
would push the necessary changes, despite a shortage of funds.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say that you don't have enough money to do the right
thing," he said.</TE>

<LD>Officials at five University of California campuses reported more
canceled classes Tuesday, but no major problems on the second day of
a two-day strike by lecturers and clerical workers.</LD>
<LD>   The walkout by hundreds of members of the University
Council-American Federation of Teachers and the Coalition of
University Employees, who seek better job security and pay, came as
UC and union officials met for a previously scheduled bargaining
session. Another meeting is scheduled for Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The strike at campuses in Irvine, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Santa
Cruz and Davis was to protest what union officials say are unfair
labor practices by UC. Lecturers have worked without a new contract
for more than two years.</LD>
<TE>   "The campuses are operating near normal," UC spokesman Paul
Schwartz said. "All the demonstrations have been peaceful and
respectful, and students who wanted to go to class -- if they were
held -- could do so without incident."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides couldn't agree on how widely the strike affected
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Fred Glass said 1,000 to 2,000 classes were
canceled over the two days -- more than 500 at UC Santa Cruz alone.</TE>
<TE>   But at UC Santa Barbara, nearly all classes have been held, campus
spokesman Paul Desruisseaux said. At UC Irvine, 76 classes were
canceled Monday and 59 as of late Tuesday, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Get a Lesson in Criminal Justice</HD>
<DH>They visit court session and take behind-scenes tour to
better teach government classes.</DH>

<LD>The high school teachers watched curiously Tuesday as a sheriff's
deputy patted down a criminal defendant in the basement lockup of the
Van Nuys Courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   Moments earlier, they saw two others being arraigned and another
pleading no contest to an attempted robbery charge.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a new educational program for government teachers
sponsored by the Los Angeles County Superior Court, more than 100
educators will attend the daylong sessions this month at six
courthouses countywide.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this, except on TV," said Jerri
Chutuk, a teacher at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies in
Reseda, after watching Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers conduct a
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Chutuk said she would use the experience to interest her students
in learning more about the courts. "When you are studying the
Constitution, it seems so foreign," she said. "You want to relate it
to real life. This is the Constitution at work."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Richard Fruin began preparing a curriculum and materials for
the program two years ago. It is an extension of a civics course he
began at Compton High School in 1996, soon after being named to the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   Fruin decided the best way to reach the county's 100,000 high
school seniors was for the judiciary to create "an authentic [court]
experience" for Los Angeles County's 900 government teachers. To get
their diplomas, all California high school seniors must complete a
government course, which includes a trial court component.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has ever taken the time to show [teachers] and explain to
them what happens in the courts," said Fruin, chairman of the
Court/Community Outreach Program.</TE>
<TE>   "They are here to really experience the courthouse. They are not
here for a seminar.... We want them to go into the holding tanks. We
want them to see, hear and smell it. We want them to see people in
shackles and see a drug court."</TE>
<TE>   Courthouses are "underutilized assets" in the community, Fruin
said, and should be used to educate the public about the judiciary
and create better-informed citizens, voters, jurors and taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The program is different at every location, depending on the types
of cases being tried in each courthouse. Participants are encouraged
to ask lots of questions.</TE>
<TE>   From the bench, Judge Darlene Schempp introduced the various
attorneys and court staff and explained their roles in the pending
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the teachers peppered Bill Weiss, who heads the public
defender's office, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Rizzo with questions
about the criminal justice system: How poor do you have to be to get
a public defender? (It's based on a person's income and number of
dependents, among other factors.) What does it mean if you are
sentenced to 25 years to life? (You must serve at least 25 years.)
Can you use a credit card to post bail? (Yes.)</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the L.A. County Office of Education, the court
also has created a free CD-ROM for educators that features three
typical courtroom scenarios with real judges and court staff.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Judge Lance Ito presides over a hearing in which a
defendant facing deportation tries to withdraw his guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   Max Krajcik has taught for 13 years at Central Juvenile Hall,
where his students are awaiting sentencing in the criminal justice
system.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is more familiar with the justice system than most
teachers, he said he now has much better information for his
students, who often ask about plea bargains and share with him their
often-harsh thoughts on their public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Krajcik said he has a new view of the system.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm seeing that the public defenders are actually a lot more
caring than the students believe," he said. "I was surprised by the
amount of compassion I felt from the prosecutor, the public defender
and the judge alike."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Flanders of Independence High, a continuation school, said he
was amazed by the circus-like atmosphere in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The judges are juggling cases amid what looks like chaos to a
courthouse outsider, he said, wowed by their productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "They are," he said, "as good as teachers."</TE>

<HD>County to Spend Tobacco Money on Health System</HD>
<DH>Supervisors approve a $5.5-million bailout, angering
anti-smoking advocates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors agreed Tuesday to use $5.5 million in
tobacco settlement money to bail out the county's cash-strapped
public hospital and mental health agency, angering anti-smoking
advocates who said the move would gut their own community health
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors insisted they had little choice but to use a portion
of the $9.6 million in tobacco funding that the county will receive
this year to preserve core health programs.</LD>
<LD>   Providing mental health and hospital care for the poor is one of
county government's basic functions, several supervisors said. Board
Chairman John Flynn called it "a moral issue."</LD>
<TE>   "You have people who can't speak for themselves who are
suffering," Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   But anti-smoking activists accused the board of raiding money that
last year was used to expand and create a host of nonprofit health
programs, including initiatives to educate the public about the
dangers of smoking. Diverting some of the revenue this year will
force cuts in those programs just as they are getting off the ground,
advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   David Rodriguez, a spokesman for the county's chapter of the
American Lung Assn., said the public's trust in supervisors to use
the money wisely "has gone out the window. This money is now being
used to backfill budgets."</TE>
<TE>   The county's Behavioral Health Department, which lost $6.6 million
in state and federal revenue earlier this year, will receive $1.5
million in tobacco funding. Ventura County Medical Center, the
county's public hospital, will get $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The money flows from the 1998 settlement of a massive lawsuit that
several states brought against major tobacco firms. The suit sought
reimbursement for millions of dollars that governments spend annually
treating uninsured patients with smoking-related illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County government's share of the settlement was estimated
to reach $250 million over 25 years.</TE>

<HD>MWD Close to Deal for Water</HD>
<DH>Agreement would transfer supplies from inland farmlands to
San Diego County to lessen Colorado River use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California water officials said Tuesday that they are close
to a deal to transfer water from inland farms to coastal cities in
compliance with a federal order to reduce the region's use of the
Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators working steadily since Saturday said they are on the
verge of an agreement that would transfer water from the Imperial and
Palo Verde valleys to San Diego County -- thus lessoning reliance on
the Colorado -- all without harming the Salton Sea, a crucial oasis
for millions of migratory birds.</LD>
<LD>   The deal would require fallowing fields in the two valleys to
bolster water supplies for San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   It also would satisfy a federal demand that California find ways
to stop using more than its legal share of the Colorado River. The
state risks losing surplus Colorado River supplies -- enough to
supply 3 million people for a year -- if it does not show substantial
progress by the end of this year on an Imperial Valley water
transfer.</TE>
<TE>   With that Dec. 31 deadline looming, Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) set an Oct. 16 target for making a deal. If he
succeeds, he is expected to announce details of the agreement today
at a legislative hearing at Imperial Irrigation District headquarters
in La Quinta. Though Metropolitan Water District officials expressed
confidence that an agreement was imminent, they were not assured of
success by late Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "We are savvy veterans of these negotiations and are mindful that
nothing is done until it's done," said Dennis Cushman, assistant
general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposed agreement collapses and the U.S. Department of
Interior cuts off the Colorado River surplus, the MWD insists that it
has enough water stored to meet all of its obligations for a year.</TE>
<TE>   But shortages and rationing could result if there were several
consecutive years of drought, said MWD officials. The agency supplies
water to 17 million people from Ventura to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "If the deal doesn't come together," said Adan Ortega Jr., MWD
vice president for external affairs, "it doesn't mean we run out of
water tomorrow. But it does call into question our long-term
reliability because there would be no guarantee of surplus water from
the Colorado River. It's the difference between being in a phased
program to reduce our reliance on the Colorado River versus being cut
off cold turkey."</TE>
<TE>   MWD has a firm right to 550,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water
but in some years has taken as much as 1.2 million acre-feet, to the
dismay of the six other states that use the river.</TE>
<TE>   Talks hung up Tuesday over the price to be paid Imperial Valley
farmers and the amount of water demanded by the neighboring Coachella
Valley farmers, who must approve any transfer.</TE>
<TE>   In a state where water rights are based on historic use, no party
gets a greater share of the Colorado River than the Imperial
Irrigation District. Desert farms there use enough water to supply 16
million people a year. Urban Southern California has sought for at
least 15 years to buy water from those farmers and ship it by canal
to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, the MWD arranged to buy enough water from the
Imperial Irrigation District to supply half a million people. Since
1997, San Diego has sought to make such a deal itself for twice as
much water. But that attempt has been complicated by concerns for the
ecological health of the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   That giant desert lake in Imperial and Riverside counties is
sustained by irrigation water that drains from Imperial Valley farms.
Although the Salton Sea is already 30% more salty than the ocean,
environmentalists fear that a drastic reduction of Imperial
irrigation drainage could make the Salton Sea hyper-saline and lethal
to fish.</TE>
<TE>   Residents also fear unhealthful dust storms swirling from an
exposed seabed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Salton Sea elevation has to remain constant," said Wally
Leimgruber, an Imperial County supervisor. "That seawater now
provides a protective cover from pollutants that could affect the
entire Imperial as well as Coachella valleys."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego had hoped to purchase 200,000 acre-feet of water from
the Imperial Valley, enough to supply about 1 million people for a
year. But those close to the talks said Imperial Valley farmers are
comfortable selling only 130,000 acre-feet to minimize harm to the
Salton Sea and soften the economic blow of having farmers stop
growing crops.</TE>
<TE>   To get more water, San Diego officials have been negotiating to
pick up some of the water they want from the Palo Verde Irrigation
District in eastern Riverside County. That would require San Diego to
share some of the cost of a deal MWD reached last summer with Palo
Verde farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Under that 35-year arrangement, the MWD would pay farmers to not
grow crops on up to 29% of their land. The MWD would get enough water
for up to half a million people for a year.</TE>

<HD>Surfer With 'Positive Vibe' Is Mourned</HD>
<DH>The body of car-bomb victim Steven Webster is still in
Bali; his injured friend is back in Orange County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after his death was confirmed half a world away, Steven
"Webbie" Webster was mourned Tuesday by friends who called him a
happy-go-lucky surfer, fisherman and golfer who shared his positive
spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Webster was killed last weekend in a car-bomb attack in Bali; he
had gone to the Indonesian island on a surfing trip with friends to
celebrate his 41st birthday.</LD>
<LD>   One companion, William Steven "Crabbie" Cabler, arrived home weak
and sick early Tuesday. Friends and family took him to Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian, where he was admitted with a broken shoulder,
third-degree burns and an injured eardrum.</LD>
<TE>   The two men were at the Sari Club in Bali on Saturday night when a
car bomb detonated, killing nearly 200 people. A bar across the
street, the Paddy Club, was also hit. Both are frequented by surfers
from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler, 42, of Newport Beach, and Huntington Beach residents
Webster, 41, and friend John Parodi Jr., 42, went to Bali to surf.
Parodi, who was not in the bar at the time of the explosion, spent
days looking for Webster in hospitals and morgues. He identified
Webster's body late Monday night. Family members are sending dental
records to Bali to reconfirm his identity before the body can be
returned home.</TE>
<TE>   Word quickly spread Tuesday through the Balboa Peninsula
neighborhood where Webster had an office. His family kept a vigil at
his Huntington Beach home, where a sign outside read "High Surf for
Steve Webster."</TE>
<TE>   Friend Todd Garrison was among those who helped set up a makeshift
memorial to Webster outside his office; it includes photographs of
Webster, a tall, tan Californian with wheat-colored hair. He is shown
the way neighbors said they will remember him: surfing the waves in
Newport and holding up big prize fish. There are surfboards pressed
against the office window and T-shirts on hangers that read
"Terrorists Don't Surf."</TE>
<TE>   Webster and his wife, Mona, along with son Dylan and stepdaughter
Samantha, were fixtures on the shore. Webster, co-owner of the
engineering firm S&amp;S Commercial Environmental Inc., spent his
lunchtimes surfing, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would surf at least four times a week. We are a tightknit
community here, and we will miss him terribly," Garrison said. "All
he did was give out a positive vibe, including advice that really
helped people."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson, 17, looked up to Webster, who had taught him surf
etiquette when he began surfing at age 8. He saw Webster the day
before he left for Bali with the new Town &amp; Country surfboard he had
bought for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   But other friends said they had been worried about the possibility
of terrorist violence in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a good time to be leaving," said Mike Sarcoz, Cabler's
roommate. "We all knew it. [Cabler] knew it.''</TE>
<TE>   Cabler said he and Webster were in the back of the crowded bar,
celebrating Webster's birthday, about 11 p.m. when they heard a blast
at the Paddy Club.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I could say anything, our building blew up.... I saw the
roof collapse on him. I looked and saw young girls burning. I saw
people burning," Cabler said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he realized that he was trapped in the bar, so "I pounded
my shoulder eight to 10 times" against a metal wall and "popped my
way out."</TE>
<TE>   "I ran down the street. I thought I was going to be picked off,"
he continued.</TE>
<TE>   Two people in a passing car picked him up and took him to a
clinic, but it was full, so they got him a hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I close my eyes I see the burning people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although family members do not expect Webster's remains to be
returned until next week, they are planning a tribute to him at 10
a.m. Saturday at 52nd Street and Seashore Drive in Newport Beach,
said family friend Trent Walker.</TE>

<HD>Surfer With a 'Positive Vibe' Is Remembered</HD>
<DH>The body of car-bomb victim Steven Webster is still in the
Indonesian island of Bali; his injured friend is back in Orange
County.</DH>

<LD>A day after his death was confirmed half a world away, Steven
"Webbie" Webster was mourned Tuesday by friends who called him a
happy-go-lucky surfer, fisherman and golfer who shared his positive
spirit with them.</LD>
<LD>   Webster was killed last weekend in a car-bomb attack in Bali; he
had gone to the Indonesian island on a surfing trip with friends to
celebrate his birthday.</LD>
<LD>   One companion, William Steven "Crabbie" Cabler, arrived home weak
and sick early Tuesday. Friends and family took him to Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian, where he was admitted with a broken shoulder,
third-degree burns and an injured eardrum.</LD>
<TE>   The two men were at the Sari Club in Bali on Saturday night when a
car bomb detonated, killing nearly 200 people. A bar across the
street, the Paddy Club, was also hit. Both are frequented by surfers
from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler, 42, of Newport Beach, and Huntington Beach residents
Webster, 41, and friend John Parodi Jr., 42, went to Bali to surf.
Parodi, who was not in the bar at the time of the explosion, spent
days looking for Webster in hospitals and morgues. He identified
Webster's body late Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Family members are sending dental records to Bali to reconfirm his
identity before the body can be returned home.</TE>
<TE>   Word quickly spread Tuesday through the Balboa Peninsula
neighborhood where Webster had an office. His family kept a vigil at
his Huntington Beach home, where a sign outside read "High Surf for
Steve Webster."</TE>
<TE>   Friend Todd Garrison was among those who helped set up a makeshift
memorial to Webster outside his office; it includes photographs of
Webster, a tall, tan Californian with wheat-colored hair.</TE>
<TE>   He is shown the way neighbors said they will remember him: surfing
the waves in Newport and holding up big prize fish. There are
surfboards pressed against the office window and T-shirts on hangers
that read "Terrorists Don't Surf."</TE>
<TE>   Webster and his wife, Mona, along with son Dylan and stepdaughter
Samantha, were fixtures on the shore.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, co-owner of the engineering firm S&amp;S Commercial
Environmental Inc., spent his lunchtimes surfing, and Mona could be
seen running or working out on the beach, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would surf at least four times a week. We are a tightknit
community here, and we will miss him terribly," Garrison said. "All
he did was give out a positive vibe, including advice that really
helped people."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson, 17, looked up to Webster, who had taught him surf
etiquette when he began surfing at age 8. He saw Webster the day
before he left for Bali with the new Town &amp; Country surfboard he had
bought for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so stoked about going," the younger surfer said. But other
friends said they had been worried about the possibility of terrorist
violence in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a good time to be leaving," said Mike Sarcoz, Cabler's
roommate. "We all knew it. [Cabler] knew it."</TE>
<TE>   Garrison said those fears were overshadowed by the trio's
excitement about the waves off Bali.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned about them going over there, but just before I
left, I said, 'Have a great time. I'll see you when you get home.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sarcoz, Cabler and another roommate share an apartment around the
corner from Webster's office. It is a bachelor pad with racks for
surfboards and an aging pool table in the living room. A 24-year-old
cat ambles about. Outside, there is a continuous parade of
wetsuit-clad young men headed to or from the surf.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler arrived home early Tuesday. Stepbrother Joseph Speigel said
that Cabler had gone to Bali several times, as well as to other famed
surfing spots, including ones in Mexico and Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler had left for Indonesia about three weeks ago, spending time
on a boat near Sumatra before meeting up with Webster.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler said he and Webster were in the back of the crowded bar,
celebrating Webster's birthday, about 11 p.m. when they heard a blast
at the Paddy Club.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I could say anything, our building blew up.... I saw the
roof collapse on him. I looked and saw young girls burning. I saw
people burning," Cabler said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he realized that he was trapped in the bar, so "I pounded
my shoulder eight to 10 times" against a metal wall and "popped my
way out."</TE>
<TE>   "I ran down the street. I thought I was going to be picked off,"
he continued.</TE>
<TE>   Two people in a passing car picked him up and took him to a
clinic, but it was full, so they got him a hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's family is planning a tribute to him at 10 a.m. Saturday
at 52nd Street and Seashore Drive in Newport Beach, said family
friend Trent Walker.</TE>

<HD>Group Blames Whale Deaths on Seismic Testing</HD>
<DH>It demands a halt to mapping of the sea floor. Researchers
say no link is proved.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Following the deaths of two beaked whales near the southern tip of
Baja California, environmental advocates demanded Tuesday that
federally funded researchers suspend their efforts to map an
underwater rift in the Earth's crust with powerful air guns.</LD>
<LD>   Five vacationing marine scientists who had chartered a sailboat in
the Gulf of California late last month happened on the two stranded
whales on the shore of Isla San Jose, an island 150 miles north of
Cabo San Lucas.</LD>
<LD>   Local fishermen told the group that the whales were alive when
they beached themselves Sept. 24, but were dead by the time the group
found them, said one of the five scientists, Jay Barlow, who heads
the National Marine Fisheries Service's coastal marine mammal
research in California.</LD>
<TE>   The group spotted a large vessel offshore, and contacted its
captain by radio to ask him to call a marine biologist they knew in
nearby La Paz to begin an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Barlow, the captain said he was unable to help
because he was doing seismic testing.</TE>
<TE>   "The scientists immediately put the two together: dead beaked
whales at the same time that this survey is going forward," said Joel
Reynolds, a senior attorney with the Los Angeles-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization.</TE>
<TE>   After halting seismic tests for several days after the discovery
of the whales, the team on the research vessel resumed its work this
week, arguing that there is no proof of a link between the project
and the whale deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental advocates say the seismic project is breaking
federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act; the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, which bans behavior that carries even the potential
of disrupting marine mammals; and the National Environmental Policy
Act, which requires the government to analyze in advance any program
that could have a significant ecological impact.</TE>
<TE>   The whales are the same type that died after controversial
military exercises in the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, apparently
resulting, most recently, in the deaths of 15 whales off northwest
Africa. A preliminary analysis of the African whales has indicated
that high-intensity sonar caused them ear and brain trauma.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the dead whales in Baja comes as environmental
advocates are preparing to head to court in San Francisco in an
attempt to block the Navy and the National Marine Fisheries Service
from deploying a powerful new sonar system.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has tried to exempt a broad range of
activities, including tests of Navy sonar systems that could affect
whales, from environmental review. A federal judge in Los Angeles has
rejected those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The 239-foot seismic testing vessel Maurice Ewing is operated by
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which is
based in New York. The scientists on board are funded by a
$1.6-million grant from the federal government's National Science
Foundation, said James Yoder, director of the foundation's Division
of Ocean Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Lamont-Doherty Director Graham Michael Purdy could not be reached
for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the foundation, the seismic research is meant to
provide the first detailed map of a long-developing crack in the
Earth's crust -- believed to be the same fissure system that flows
north through California, incorporates the San Andreas fault and
contributes to the potential for earthquakes on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The project is using a synchronized system of 20 powerful air guns
that can register 220 decibels -- more powerful even than the sonar
blamed in the deaths of whales elsewhere, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   The group that found the whales had hoped to do a necropsy, but
the whales were too decomposed by the time a marine biologist
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how it can possibly be resolved given the information
that is available in this case," Yoder said. "To establish scientific
proof of a link is impossible ... there was no necropsy."</TE>
<TE>   Curt Suplee, a foundation spokesman in Arlington, Va., said the
agency is concerned about the whales but is weighing a number of
factors in determining how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not closed-minded. We'll be happy to look at any evidence,"
Suplee said. "But it's difficult to say what is a sensible use of tax
money and what is a responsible way to conduct a valuable scientific
project.</TE>
<TE>   "Should you cancel it on basically the inference that something
might have damaged these animals? Or should you let it continue until
you get something approximating evidence? At present, the expedition
is going to continue."</TE>
<TE>   The research vessel has attempted to safeguard against the deaths
of more whales by, among other things, placing observers on deck with
binoculars in an attempt to avoid them.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental advocates say those measures fall short. The
observers, for example, can see only the water's surface, far above
the depths where most whales spend the bulk of their time, the
advocates point out.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds called the argument that there is no proven link between
the research and the deaths "pretty weak."</TE>
<TE>   "As you are certainly aware, the Gulf of California is an
extraordinarily rich marine habitat for a broad range of species,
including one of the most significant populations of beaked whales in
the world," Reynolds wrote last week to Lamont-Doherty and the
National Science Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Given this fact and the recognized risks associated with the use
of intense low-frequency sound, we are dismayed that there was
apparently no attempt to conduct a meaningful assessment of the
survey's environmental risks before allowing it to proceed."</TE>
