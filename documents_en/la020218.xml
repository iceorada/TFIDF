<HD>Does TV Sell Records? Ask Chris Isaak</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Music stars looking for television appearances to promote songs take
note: Chris Isaak, whose album hits the charts this week, has
discovered a foolproof way to guarantee air time. The singer has the
rare luxury of his own Showtime comedy series, aptly named "The Chris
Isaak Show," and it's become a quirky favorite of critics. But will
it help his music career?</LD>
<LD>   Liz Rosenberg, senior vice president of publicity at Warner Bros.
Records, has worked with Isaak for more than a decade and says the
show has given the singer his highest degree of celebrity. But she
also said it's hard to predict whether a nonmusical spotlight will
help every artist light it up at record stores. Rosenberg pointed to
the example of one of Warner's biggest stars, Madonna, who had a
controversial film, book and album in 1993. "We were all thrilled
with the cross-promotion but, you know what, everything suffered....
Sometimes things don't work out the way you think."</LD>
<TE>   There's also the concern that a secondary career might undermine
or overwhelm a music star who might otherwise be touring or promoting
the music. Rosenberg, though, says Isaak's percolating pop culture
status and devotion to his music should poise the new album, "Always
Got Tonight," for a bigger debut performance than his last release,
which sold 30,000 copies its first week. An interesting wrinkle, she
says, is that the majority of the show's viewers are men while the
majority of Isaak's music fans are female, a fact that his camp hopes
is a strength, not a weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers say the small-screen life can only help Isaak at the
record rack. "What the show does is differentiate him from all the
other singers out there, and that alone is a big deal," says Scott
Levin, director of music marketing for the Musicland chain of stores.
"There's definitely a benefit, but how the album fares on the radio
will have a bigger impact."</TE>

<HD>Costner Needs Some 'Dragonfly' Buzz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a long time between hits for Kevin Costner, who goes back
to the plate once again on Friday in the supernatural thriller
"Dragonfly." It's a change of pace for Costner and for its director,
Tom Shadyac, who's best known for directing such comedies as "Ace
Ventura" and "The Nutty Professor."</LD>
<LD>   In "Dragonfly," a Universal Pictures film, Costner portrays a
doctor who believes that his deceased wife is trying to communicate
with him using the sign of a dragonfly and through near-death
experiences of his patients.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the 47-year-old actor teamed with Universal was in
1999 for the baseball drama "For Love of the Game," and the results
were somewhat explosive. Costner got upset over several lines of
humorous, obscenity-laced dialogue that were trimmed or altered so
that the film could receive a PG-13 rating. His outburst in the press
infuriated Universal, which then publicly backed director Sam Raimi
over the actor.</LD>
<TE>   Coming after last year's "3,000 Miles to Graceland," a commercial
and critical flop, Costner could use even a moderate hit.</TE>
<TE>   "About a decade ago, he was one of the biggest A-list stars in
Hollywood," said Gitesh Pan- dya, editor of Boxofficeguru.com. "He
could not do wrong." But, as Pandya notes: "He really needs to pick
the right projects with the right directors and the right scripts. I
wouldn't toss him aside--his agent just needs to find him the right
role."</TE>

<HD>DJ Carl Cox Inspires With Flawless Work on Turntable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 15 years, Manchester, England, DJ  Carl Cox has been
the man in the dance world, so it was understandable that fans began
lining up as early as 3 p.m. for his appearance Saturday night at
Spundae at Circus.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the fan fervor, the mood inside was remarkably
unpretentious. Cox, who's been deejaying since before it became big
business, genuinely has fun on stage. His showmanship, including his
exuberant grins, gestating dancing and occasional words to the crowd,
was unquestionably sincere. If that was a bit surprising,  only
because so few deejays allow themselves real emotions on stage,
everything else was as promised.</LD>
<LD>   From a technical standpoint, Cox's performance was so flawless
that one could almost forget there was a man mining the turntables
and decks. He allowed himself an occasionally flashy scratch on the
turntable or showy stop and start of a CD, but his biggest moments
were saved for the intense transitions that worked the crowd into a
frenzy.</LD>
<TE>   Cox, whose taste leans toward dance-heavy techno rather than the
more obvious crowd-pleasing keyboards of trance, used both styles
effectively, as well as spinning a number of heavily percussive
tracks and even the occasional jungle beat. However, it was the way
the trance and techno tunes blended seamlessly into one long euphoric
groove that was inspiring.</TE>

<HD>Nudged Out of the  Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Oscars*  A rule limiting the number of producers receiving
awards is forcing difficult choices on some filmmaking teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could prove to be a more momentous disappearing
act--certainly for the filmmakers--than any magic conjured up on
screen by the wizard Gandalf in New Line Cinema's "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the four credited producers of
the film have agreed to let arbitrators decide which one of the four
will not get to step up on stage at the Kodak Theatre next month
should the film be named best picture at the Academy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   It is a wrenching decision for the tightly knit filmmakers, who
labored long and hard in New Zealand to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's 1954
fantasy novel to the screen, said executive producer Mark Ordesky.
The film received 13 Oscar nominations last week, including best
picture.</LD>
<LD>   But in the end, the producers, who include the film's
Oscar-nominated director, Peter Jackson, decided that their
friendships and future business relationships were too important to,
in "Survivor"-like style, cast ballots to see who would stay and who
must be jettisoned.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Ordesky said, choosing which three producers to list
as nominees will be left with the producers branch executive
committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. The
committee must settle the issue before the academy holds its annual
pre-Oscar luncheon for nominees March 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings" is one of three Oscar-nominated films
caught in the academy's credit squeeze. Both Disney/Pixar's
"Monsters, Inc." and Paramount/Nickelodeon's "Jimmy Neutron: Boy
Genius," which are up for best picture in Oscar's new feature
animation category, are being asked to submit the name of a key
creative contributor for each film who will be eligible to accept the
Oscar. Sources say that each studio is leaning toward letting the
academy's short films and feature animation branch executive
committee name that person.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's move to limit the number of producers on stage to
three was applauded by the Producers Guild of America, which has long
lobbied for studios to rein in the practice of dispensing producing
credits to people who have little or nothing to do with making the
movie.The three-producer rule was enacted two years ago by the
producers branch after five producers took the stage to accept Oscars
for Miramax Films' 1999's "Shakespeare in Love." One of those was
Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein, who was listed as a producer in the
credits. During the show, he joined other producers on the stage and
gave an acceptance speech, leaving producer Ed Zwick trying to get
his turn at the microphone before the orchestra started up again.</TE>
<TE>   It was reported afterward that Zwick considered this incident a
"mugging," and published reports say he later recalled that at that
moment on stage he had a choice "between a random act of violence
before a viewing public of 2 billion people or false modesty."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the academy has toughened its rules, specifically
ruling that studio executives and personal managers are ineligible to
take the stage or receive a statuette for best picture unless they
have fully functioned as producers on the picture.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "The Lord of the Rings," academy executive director
Bruce Davis expressed hope that the filmmakers themselves would
choose which one of the four producers would be dropped from the list
of nominees, noting that up to now the academy has never arbitrated
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never had an arbitration," Davis said. "In the two prior
years, the creators themselves have always made the decision."</TE>
<TE>   But in a telephone interview from Wellington, New Zealand, where
Jackson and his crew are deep into post-production on the second of
the $300 million "Ring" trilogy, executive producer Ordesky said the
filmmakers want the academy to decide.</TE>
<TE>   Ordesky, who is also president of New Line's art house label Fine
Line Features, said the producers had been aware of the academy's
three-producer rule before the movie was submitted. The producers
include Jackson, co-screenwriter Frances Walsh, Barrie M. Osborne and
Tim Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   "Since they don't allow more than three names, we decided mutually
that rather than sort it out among ourselves, it might be more fair
to have a third party--an objective, impartial body--make the
decision," Ordesky said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, Jackson and Walsh are all New Zealanders who have worked
together on "Rings" and on Jackson's 1996 film, "The Frighteners."
Sources noted that Sanders was involved in the entire pre-production
phase of "Rings" but departed the project three months into the
15-month shoot. And when the producers guild announced the nominees
for its annual Producer of the Year honors last Thursday, missing
from the list of producers on "The Lord of the Rings" was Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Osborne, a veteran producer with such credits as "Face/Off" and
"The Matrix," joined the "Rings" project in April 1999 while Sanders
was still with the film. A veteran action producer, Osborne was
brought on board to help oversee Jackson's massive production, which
had a cast and crew of 2,500.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Disney/Pixar film, "Monsters, Inc.," Pixar must
decide whether producer Darla K. Anderson will be the designated
recipient or Pixar founder John Lasseter, who is credited as an
executive producer on the movie. Pixar did not return telephone calls
seeking a response as to what course it might follow, but sources
close to the film said Pixar may let the academy arbitrate the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount Pictures, which released the Nickelodeon movie "Jimmy
Neutron: Boy Genius," also declined comment on which of its
producers--John A. Davis, Paul Marshal or Steve Oedekerk--would
accept the Oscar should the film win. Sources said Paramount may also
opt to let the academy resolve the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Davis conceded that it might not be easy choosing one producer who
should receive the statuette in the animation category.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are looking for there is a single recipient--the key
creative contributor to the film," Davis said. "This is not always
easy to determine."</TE>
<TE>   The producers guild, meanwhile, argues that the proliferation of
producer credits in movies as well as television only dilutes the
work of real producers, who develop the material and oversee the
entire production.</TE>
<TE>   The guild believes that the academy's move to pare down the list
of producer nominees for best picture can only help its cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We're extremely supportive of what [the academy] has done," said
Vance Van Petten, the guild's executive director. "It was a very
brave move, even though you can argue that attaching a numerical
figure [to the awards] is arbitrary. But something desperately needed
to be done."</TE>

<AU>HOWARD BRAGMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Oscar nominee:</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations. I can't imagine anything more exciting than that
early morning phone call you got last week telling you you'd just
been nominated for an Academy Award. March 24 will be here before you
know it. If this is your first time, you'll be amazed at how much
work you have to do until then and how quickly the time will pass.</LD>
<LD>   If you're an acting nominee, you'll have the added responsibility
of having every journalist and every viewer judge your date, your
outfit and, of course, your acceptance speech come Oscar night.</LD>
<TE>   I'm already booked that night so I won't go as your date, and you
don't want me to be your stylist, but I can help you with your
speech. And trust me: Your best friend, your agent, your manager and
your publicist certainly aren't going to tell you the truth (they all
want to hear their names read in front of 1 billion people from the
stage of the Kodak Theatre). So it's up to me. You're not going to be
thanking me anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Have you been watching some of the recent awards shows? Is there
anything more boring than hearing one of your otherwise talented
fellow actors reading off a long list of names from a crumpled piece
of paper in bad light without reading glasses on network television?
I think not.</TE>
<TE>   With a little planning and honest introspection, there's no reason
you can't say something memorable, quotable and moving. Like all the
best "spontaneous" public moments in Hollywood, this one takes some
careful planning.</TE>
<TE>   Before you prepare your speech, you need to ask yourself a few
questions about the project and your place in it.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a project that might only get one or two awards or is it
likely to be a major award winner? Was this a passion project that
you nurtured for a decade or something where you filmed it for a few
weeks, forgot about it and went on to the next paycheck? Were you the
star and the creator or a minor player in a bigger success?</TE>
<TE>   What is your personal place in the awards show constellation? Are
you an octogenarian finally getting recognition for a lifetime of
work? Are you a lucky neophyte? Are you Tom Hanks, who has had to add
on a well-deserved trophy room to his home? Whether this is your
moment or one of many moments will help set the tenor of your
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Just because everyone you know has seen your film, don't assume
everyone has seen it. Tragically, in many other parts of the country,
most people do not have access to "academy screeners." Think about
what drew you to the project in the first place. Was it a character,
a script, a message, a director or something else? This is not just
an award, it is a chance to position and market a work. Say something
meaningful. Even if your film did an impressive $150 million at the
domestic box office, less than 10% of the country has seen it. This
is a chance to introduce them to a great work or inspire them to see
it a second time.</TE>
<TE>   It is OK to thank the one or two people who really made a
difference in your life and this project. Don't make it the
centerpiece of your remarks, but do acknowledge someone's genuine
contribution without mentioning their job title or the name of their
company. If you want to thank your agent, manager or publicist, think
about Dom Perignon, flowers, dinners, expensive presents and, in the
case of publicists, raising their monthly retainer fees. Or simply
say thank you in person, with a handwritten note or with years of
loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   There are some don'ts in this business:</TE>
<TE>   * Don't go beyond the time limit or the orchestra will start with
the theme song and someone will drag you and your dignity off the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't be dull. Think of this as a performance. If you really do
win, you'll have enough adrenalin and emotion that it's sure to show
and you'll be glad you have a little something prepared.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't let your outfit overshadow what you have to say.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't worry. Even if you do forget to acknowledge your spouse,
you can make up for it in the press the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, even if you think you don't have a chance in hell, be
prepared. I share two words with clients who think they'll never win
and have no reason to prepare: "Marisa Tomei." Then, if they tell me
that even if they do win they'll think of something clever on the
spur of the moment, I say "Sally Field" and they turn to butter.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, every nominee should have the right to give an acceptance
speech, even if it's just in the shower or to the dog. That's part of
the fun of the awards process--to dream of the possibilities.</TE>

<LD>When filmmaker John Waters performed with triple-X vocalist Peaches
at the El Rey Theatre on Friday, they were, of course, the embodiment
of bad taste. During the campy double bill, headliner Waters detailed
his rise from an excrement-obsessed no-name to cult hero in his
appropriately titled stand-up routine, "Shock Value."</LD>
<LD>   The 56-year-old director, who is as much of a character as any of
the stars in his many films, held an hourlong VIP meet-and-greet
before his show, signing autographs and fielding questions from a
handful of fans who had paid $75 to yuk it up with the man
responsible for some of the most revolting films of all time.</LD>
<LD>   Waters told one fan that many of the people in the room looked
like they were from Baltimore, the town where he was raised and has
shot his films. That may or may not have been the case, though it
could have been a casting call: disco victims in gold chain belts,
rockabilly girls with skunk-striped hair, even a transvestite (though
he was slimmer than Divine, the obese cross-dresser who starred in
many of Waters' early films).</LD>
<TE>   Before Waters appeared on stage, Peaches, a singer-rapper with a
libido seemingly in overdrive, opened the evening with a high-energy
but low-class romp. The red curtain drew back to reveal Peaches and a
girlfriend enjoying a white trash moment: chugging Corona and
slurping spaghetti.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning her show wearing a pink satin jacket, black pants and
snakeskin ankle boots, she proceeded to lose an article of clothing
with every song. Two tracks in, her jacket was gone, revealing an
ill-fitting red satin tank. By the next song, she had stripped off
the tank to show the waistband of her fishnet stockings riding high
over a pair of hot pants that were, predictably, gone by the time she
got to her next number.</TE>
<TE>   With mullet-like curly locks and 5 o'clock underarm shadow,
Peaches' allure is a raw exhibitionism and trashy sex appeal that
says she'd be just as happy getting it on in a dumpster as she would
at home. The singer premiered two songs in as many encores, ending
her performance by spitting fake blood, stage diving into the crowd,
then snapping a picture of the audience before departing. Highly
entertaining, Peaches' go-for-broke performance primed the audience
for Waters.</TE>
<TE>   In an hour program that was not just a laugh a minute but a guffaw
every 15 seconds, "the filth elder," as he called himself,
demonstrated he is a natural monologuist, on par with the likes of
Eric Bogosian.</TE>
<TE>   Loosely based on his 1981 book of the same title, "Shock Value"
was a lurid and hilarious look at Waters' life and career, peppered
with cultural commentary. In it, he talked about a youth that
cultivated his passion for sleaze, from the days he idolized "The Bad
Seed" star Patty McCormack to his first sexual experience in a
library. He then chronicled his early days as a filmmaker--from
screening films in church basements to handing out scratch 'n sniff
cards to moviegoers so they could share fully the abominations on
screen--and gave brief highlights from his controversial film
history.</TE>
<TE>   Waters got his start in 1964 with the film "Hag in a Black Leather
Jacket," but it wasn't until 1972 that he came out with what he
called his most notorious movie--"Pink Flamingos." "If I discovered
the cure for cancer tomorrow, 'Pink Flamingos' would still be ahead
of that in my obituary," Waters quipped. The 1972 cult classic had
characters competing for the title of world's filthiest person.</TE>
<TE>   "Polyester," his 1981 film starring former teen heartthrob Tab
Hunter, marked his entrance into first-run theaters, and in 1988 he
"accidentally made a family movie" called "Hairspray," starring
then-unknown actress and present-day talk-show host Ricki Lake."I
remember the day I got a PG rating. I held my head in shame," Waters
said. "Hairspray" is now being made into a Broadway show--an
experience that has him feeling like Bob Fosse, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hairspray," a film about racial tolerance, among other things,
marked the beginning of bigger-budget movies with marquee-value
stars, from "Cry-Baby" starring Johnny Depp and Patty Hearst, to
"Serial Mom" with Kathleen Turner, to his most recent release, "Cecil
B. Demented," starring Melanie Griffith as a fading star who is
kidnapped by renegade filmmakers who force her to act in their movie.</TE>
<TE>   Among the movies he said he'd like to make in the future: "Holy
Anorexia," a film about the eating disorders of saints, and anything
starring Don Knotts.</TE>
<TE>   Waters ended his show by answering audience questions. What's your
favorite fetish? ("Catholicism.") Did you ever sleep with Divine?
("No, that's why we were friends to the end.") Who would play you in
a biopic? ("Steve Buscemi in my youth, and Don Knotts in my autumn.")</TE>

<HD>The Many Faces of Odile-Odette</HD>
<DH>The dramatic impact of 'Swan Lake' turns on the dual role.
But the ABT's performers bring varying levels of skill to the
black-white character.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems very much as if playing the dual role of good swan and bad
swan in "Swan Lake" is more difficult than ever for today's American
Ballet Theatre dancers. At least, this is the conclusion following
swan  sightings at four different performances last week at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that Kevin McKenzie's version of this classic
grows on you--despite a few trouble spots; his streamlining often
works;  the added scenes that expand upon the creepiness of the
sorcerer Von Rothbart make evil a more tangible presence than in
mustier productions.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the whole ballet never really fires unless the two main
characters light the spark in the crucial white and black swan
scenes.</LD>
<TE>   With the depth of talent at ABT, few audience members go home
thinking they've seen a badly danced swan or prince. And there's
always the invigorating first act pas de trois, which features a
series of consistently vibrant soloists dancing with buoyant, affable
charm. But finding a full-service Odette-Odile combination was rare.</TE>
<TE>   Technical fireworks kept each black swan pas de deux lively at
least; everyone had turns, leaps and legs out to there, and every
Odile varied the theme of a wily seductress.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Paloma Herrera sent her serenely arched feet into
high angles, and alternated single, double and triple turns in her
fouette series as if the devil himself had wound her up.</TE>
<TE>   She flashed smoldering, duplicitous glances that only a besotted,
formerly shy prince (the supremely convincing Marcelo Gomes) wouldn't
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, Irina Dvorovenko was a pretty, preening
villainess, perhaps more aware of seducing the audience than her
prince (the seriously elegant Maxim Belotserkovsky)  but impressively
swift and well-placed all the same.</TE>
<TE>   The problem seemed to be with embodying the bewitched white swan,
Odette. Her trembling, mourning vulnerability eluded both Herrera and
Dvorovenko, as beautiful as were their stretched, angled postures.
Nor could a resolutely sturdy Ashley Tuttle, partnered by Gennadi
Saveliev on Wednesday night, breathe life into the character who
needs, at the least, a few shivers running through a flexible spine
and a more creature-like sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   It looked as if these three couldn't shuck their own authoritative
gestures, couldn't find a window into an eccentric, other self. Other
swans at the lake also suffered from this disability.</TE>
<TE>   With Gillian Murphy on Saturday afternoon, the specter of Odette's
suffering rose with utter believability and electricity. Pauses and
pliability became fear and filigreed yearning; pirouettes that
started delicately and built in strength were like the quickening of
hope and resolve.</TE>
<TE>   The drama was in the details, shared by her Prince Siegfried, Jose
Manuel Carreno, who was also using an impeccable technique to tell a
story. As he folded her into the several swan-wing embraces, their
intensity matched that of Tchaikovsky's exquisite violins.</TE>
<TE>   In the black swan pas de deux, Carreno's love was still
blossoming, even as he was deceived by Murphy's slyly manipulative
Odile, and his sailing leaps and soft landings became all about his
newfound happiness. Again, the score's expansive, soaring clues were
maximized by finely tuned emotions and timing.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's long lines spread and folded for a reason, her go-for-it
velocity in the turns impressed (and nearly derailed her, heightening
the danger). The slow caress of her conquest's face before flinging
an arm back in victory punctuated the triumph masterfully.</TE>
<TE>   When tragedy followed, it felt visceral, not old-fashioned, and
the enthusiastic audience reaction raised the roof.</TE>
<TE>   There were high points in other casts, but Murphy and Carreno were
the gold standard. Love, innocence, evil, death, redemption--it was
all there, in beautifully nuanced black and white.</TE>

<HD>Joan Sebastian Rebounds With Spirit</HD>
<DH>The Mexican country artist comes back from cancer treatment
with a lively and heartfelt show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Near the start of his 90-minute concert on Friday at the Universal
Amphitheatre, Mexican singer-songwriter Joan Sebastian saluted a
guest in the front row--his private physician. "This is for you,
doc," said the 50-year-old pop music veteran in good English. "Great
job!"</LD>
<LD>   Sebastian shared that aside with a house full of affectionate fans
who have followed his recent fight against bone cancer, which at one
point brought him to Los Angeles' City of Hope for treatment. By
thanking his doctor, Sebastian was letting everybody know he's
feeling much better.</LD>
<LD>   But he also proved it with a spirited and heartfelt performance of
songs from his 30-year career, covering styles from brassy banda to
yearning ballads with a distinct Nashville touch.</LD>
<TE>   Sebastian (ne  Jose  Manuel Figueroa) ranks among Mexico's leading
pop figures, though he remains somewhat underrated. In popularity,
he's been overshadowed by his more flamboyant countryman Juan
Gabriel, though Sebastian is arguably a more skilled and
sophisticated song craftsman.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, few other artists could handle a horse like Sebastian,
known for his trick riding at rodeo-style shows. During his last
equestrian performance at Staples Center in June 2000, he announced
that his illness was forcing him out of the saddle, at doctor's
orders.</TE>
<TE>   The dismounting proved to be a hidden blessing, allowing
Sebastian's warm and engaging personality to shine through with no
tricks on stage Friday. Dressed in a  sequined western suit and
cowboy hat, he made the amphitheater feel like a small coffeehouse
during a segment in which he sat on a stool and played guitar. Backed
by an accordion sounding like a soulful harmonica, the former
seminarian and confessed womanizer made many songs of loss and regret
sound autobiographical.</TE>
<TE>   Though his gait was a bit unsteady and his occasional dance steps
tentative, he still displayed flashes of that bravado so essential to
Mexican country music. Behind him was an array of more than 40
musicians, a colorful folkloric symphony of banda brass, mariachi
violins and pop guitars.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the singer jokingly complained to his doctor that
chemotherapy was making him forget his lyrics. It was a glimpse of
the sense of humor that enlivens Sebastian's more folksy songs--and
which no doubt has helped him survive well beyond his original
prognosis.</TE>
<TE>   "Sean felices," said the singer as he exited to cheers. "Be
happy."</TE>

<HD>A Diverse TISQ With Cuban Flavor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Turtle Island String Quartet, since its inception in the late
'80s, has taken the view that the best way to approach music is to
forget about genres and boundaries. As a result, the quartet has
generated a startlingly eclectic array of music, stretching easily
from jazz, Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa to R&amp;B, world music and
bluegrass--with numerous stops in between.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night at El Camino College's Marsee Auditorium, the
quartet got together with clarinetist Paquito D'Rivera for a program
that added a heady seasoning of Cuban elements to a typically diverse
program of music.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece of the concert was El Jicotea, a newly
commissioned work composed by D'Rivera for the TISQ. Well-crafted
(Rivera is classically trained), the piece simmered with bits and
pieces of Latin rhythms as the brief, but attractive, principal theme
arched through flowing contrapuntal passages. As a showcase work, it
will serve the TISQ well in future appearances.</LD>
<TE>   The most appealing segments of the program, however, were those in
which D'Rivera performed with the quartet. The combination of
clarinet and string quartet--usually referred to as a Clarinet
Quintet--has resulted in some of the finest music in the classical
canon, notably the Quintets by Mozart and Brahms.</TE>
<TE>   D'Rivera and the TISQ found other pleasures in the
instrumentation, however, especially in the dramatically contrasting
"Zombie Woof" (by Zappa), "Maracatu" (by Brazilian composer Egberto
Gismonti and "A Night in Tunisia" (by Dizzy Gillespie). In addition
to other attributes, the members of TISQ are all improvising
musicians, and the opportunity to stretch out with D'Rivera in
spontaneous fashion--especially on "A Night In Tunisia"--produced
some impressive results.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   D'Rivera, clearly enjoying the musical setting, added some fun
with the audience during his solo, quoting the opening phrase of
Gillespie's "Salt Peanuts," urging the crowd to respond with the
familiar verbal phrase--which they did. The individual members of
TISQ--founder David Balakrishnan, violin, and Mark Summer, cello, as
well as violist Danny Seidenberg and newest member Evan Price, viola,
affirmed, as they have for years, that in their hands the string
quartet, individually and collectively, can function in musically
creative fashion in any style with any guest artist.</TE>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clicking you hear is the sound of word processors pounding out
proposals, treatments and screenplays.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Hollywood's most creative minds have been highly
energized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the 2002 Oscar
nominations and the Winter Olympics. Through television, the year's
talked-about movies and this month's Salt Lake City Games may have
the opportunity to endure indefinitely in prime time.</LD>
<LD>   This information comes from the same unreliable, impeachable,
irresponsible, thoroughly tongue-in-cheek and
not-to-be-taken-seriously sources on which this column has always
relied.</LD>
<TE>   Don't forget, it's here where you learned of plans for such TV
series as "Shinefeld," "Fargo Blue," "Mr. Wacko and the English
Patient," "Shakespeare in the Love Boat" and "Will &amp; Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   As for the present, bank on a TV movie about Canadian skating duo
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, of course. It will air in a ratings
sweeps month next season and be loosely based on the spirit of an
approximation of facts indirectly related to rumors surrounding
something on the order of the 2002 pairs figure skating controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, a few minor alterations of truth will be necessary
to provide a level of conflict that will ensure success. The movie
will portray disqualified French skating judge Marie Reine Le Gougne
as being linked to Al Qaeda terrorists, and end with Jamie and David
receiving their gold medals, then skating off into a Canadian sunset
to a thundering musicale before signing with CNN to host a talk show.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake in tow, is readying
its own version of the skate-judging debacle: "French Me!"</TE>
<TE>   In addition, producer Dick Wolf is said to be negotiating with NBC
for his fourth "Law &amp; Order" series, this one titled "Law &amp; Order:
Judges' Intent," a suspenseful thriller shown through the eyes of
corrupt figure skating judges and elite International Olympic
Committee investigators who uncover their dishonest, politically
motivated decisions. A sure bet to compete strongly against popular
"Judge Judy" and other courtroom shows in daytime syndication will be
the powerhouse "Judge Marie Reine."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, three high-profile films, "A Beautiful Mind," "The
Invisible Man" and "Gosford Park," are quickening the pulses of TV
visionaries, who see them as blockbuster miniseries with distinctive
Jewish twists:</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mohel," "The Invisible Mensch" and "Goy Park."</TE>
<TE>   One respected executive regards "A Beautiful Mind" as too cerebral
for prime time, however, believing it would pull down bigger Nielsens
as a compelling triumph-over-adversity tale about a young TV news
anchor.</TE>
<TE>   One title being kicked around: "A Beautiful Moron."</TE>
<TE>   Probably no Oscar-nominated movie has generated interest from a
broader cross-section of the TV industry than "In the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Fox version: "Caught on Tape in the Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   Also earning glowing reviews is the concept for "I Am Sam." An
adult with the IQ of a 7-year-old may be a bit of a downer for prime
time, however. Instead, a circus acrobat struggling to raise his
young daughter as a single parent holds forth in "I Am Sampesi."</TE>
<TE>   Although state-of-the-art action fantasies like "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" scare off most small-screen
producers, no concept is too sweeping for Robert Halmi Sr. Loving a
challenge, this legendary TV impresario responsible for such
miniseries as "Noah's Ark" and "Gulliver's Travels" is known to be
planning a Tolkien spinoff of astonishing scope. It would be Halmi's
masterwork, uniting this latest "Lord of the Rings" and "The Lords of
Flatbush" in a cohesive miniseries alternating between Middle-earth
and Coney Island in the 1950s. Completing the homage, in a leather
jacket, would be Sylvester Stallone as Frodo Baggins.</TE>
<TE>   As for the offbeat "Sexy Beast," Fox is very high on its own
version: "Sexy Beasts That Kill."</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to humor, the smart money is on "Monster's Ball" being
retooled as a nostalgic sitcom. Herman, Lily and Grandpa would again
get laughs galore, this time as desperate monsters turning to each
other for solace, in "The Munsters Ball."</TE>
<TE>   Also in development as half-hour comedies are several can't-miss
versions of Robert Altman's upstairs-downstairs film, "Gosford Park."
A good-natured family man is the center of "Everybody Loves Gosford."
A black rapper from a tough U.S. neighborhood relocates to the snooty
British countryside in "Fresh Prince of Gosford." And a neurotic
blockhead who believes the world is out to get him spends his life in
a cave in "Gosford Paranoic."</TE>
<TE>   "Training Day" is another hot item for prime time. By sheer
coincidence, young-minded UPN and the WB are exploring an identical
comedy version: "Training Bra."</TE>

<LD>Rabbi Niles Elliot Goldstein made very impassioned and thoughtful
observations about the appeal of the mythological underpinnings of
"The Lord of the Rings" ("Lesson of 'Lord of the Rings': Clarity in a
Time of Darkness," Feb. 11). But I wonder how his assessment might
have been affected if he were aware of the mythical source material
from which J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed heavily.</LD>
<LD>   That source is Germanic mythology--which at one critical point in
German history touched that deep and ancient font of human yearning
in a manner that the world would never forget.</LD>
<LD>   It helped foster horrors that beggared the imagination and
outstripped anything a collective body of mythological imagery and
language could convey or de- scribe.</LD>
<TE>   Myths are fine as a source of inspiration and fable, but we
shouldn't allow their primal allure to cloud our collective sense of
reason. Human suffering is just that--a product of human interaction
motivated by greed, opportunism, ignorance, and prejudice that is
often enabled by murderously delusional perceptions of reality.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the grim realities that can be found at the base of
infamous events in history, they can only be addressed in the context
of this world and not one of gods and demons.</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Saves</HD>
<DH>Allen Reid and his fellow 'dog-robbers' dig up hard-to-find
props for frantic filmmakers. But don't expect to see their names in
the credits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phone books piled high on Allen Reid's kitchen table show that he's
working, searching, scrounging. "Actually, what I'm doing is
dog-robbing," he says. "You never heard of that? Proves you're not in
the Industry. Industry people know what that is."</LD>
<LD>   Reid is a forager, of sorts. "You put me anywhere, give me a
Yellow Pages, and I'll get what you need. I don't even have to know
what it is. I just need to know what it's called."</LD>
<LD>   He's an independent, someone who finds things for TV and film
people who are paid to find them but can't. He's a prop man's prop
man, a costumer's secret consort, a set decorator's last resort. A
guy to call when people with real 9-to-5 jobs have already scoured
EBay, swap meets, secondhand stores and still can't come up with the
requisite stuff. He is proudly a part of what he frequently refers to
as The Industry--but just barely.</LD>
<TE>   Like thousands in Hollywood who help make films, he's so far out
on the edge that his name will never appear, even in those credits
that flash by so briefly, proclaiming the identities of gaffers, best
boys, greensmen and caterers attached to a film. Yet he's a part of
Hollywood's pulse. And that's enough for him.</TE>
<TE>   Reid does business as "Anything Found Reliably"--a catch-all name
that accurately reflects the idiosyncratic nature of his work--and
his life.</TE>
<TE>   He gets calls day and night, and almost always last-minute. "You
wake up in the morning, and you never know what's going to happen.
It's a really cool way of life."</TE>
<TE>   The reason he gets so little lead time on each job, he says, is
because "everyone thinks they can find things on their own. They try
to do it themselves to save money." When the clock runs down, and
they haven't found it, he says, they call him, willing to pay his
rate, which he won't discuss. "My rates vary. I can be hired for a
half or full day, a week or month. There are different degrees of
difficulty for each job and different rates for various media."</TE>
<TE>   He is neither the biggest nor the best in his business, he tells
you. There are dozens of other dog-robbers in town. Many have
specialties. He's partial to military garb and gear. "Medals, badges,
guns and stuff. But I'll find anything you ask me for."</TE>
<TE>   Not too long ago, there was panic on the set when a prop man--the
kind who gets screen credit for his work--was unable to come up with
a huge clam shell from which a magnificent sea nymph was supposed to
emerge. An emergency call was made to Reid, who produced the
humongous shell. From where? "I never tell trade secrets," he says.
"I started with nautical places and worked it from there. People all
the time ask me my sources, and I say no."</TE>
<TE>   In this Industry town, filled with workers paid handsomely (or at
least union scale) to bring stories to the big and little screen,
people like Reid, with odd lines of ancillary work, get little
recognition or thanks. That's why the satisfaction and pride they
evidence in their work is somehow inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from an Industry family," he says. "My mom and at least seven
other close relatives were in The Industry." He says the words as if
it were an exclusive club, something you "belong to," with its own
vocabulary and rules--even its own code of dress. "If you see a bunch
of industry guys and gals anywhere, you can pick them out. They have
a certain demeanor, a certain look, a certain way of wearing the
shorts, the T-shirt, the belt, the baseball cap. There's just a
certain way of telling who's in the business and who isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Mike LeVitre is. He's a sculptor, another unsung toiler who helps
make Hollywood tick. He does mostly large-scale works these days, he
says, but he can sculpt anything. What some might find weird about
his work is that he sculpts mostly in polystyrene foam, otherwise
known as Styrofoam. LeVitre makes movie magic by helping carve things
like the boat in "Hook," a full scale replica of the Lincoln Memorial
for the movie "Nixon" ("Lincoln's head was 6 feet tall," he recalls).</TE>
<TE>   He worked on the Disney TV movie "Cinderella," which he proudly
reports won an Emmy for art direction. "Of course, I was not listed
in credits for the film. It runs about 60-40 against credits for
people like me," he says. "We're in Local 755, which is the
plasterers, model makers and sculptors local. We don't even have a
category in the Academy Awards."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's complaining, he quickly adds. But people like him
and Reid, who is his friend, do unusual kinds of work that merits
recognition sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It amazes me that people who drive the honey wagons get credit,
and people like me do not," LeVitre says. "We sculptors provide a lot
of the visual entertainment on screen." (A honey wagon is the truck
that carries portable toilets, in case you wanted to know.)</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating Demand</TE>
<TE>   LeVitre has worked on two "Jurassic Park" films ("for those I did
mostly rocks and trees"), "The Flintstones," "Hook," "Scary Movie"
... he goes on. He headed a project at Universal Studios to sculpt
two enormous Egyptian seated figures at the entry to the Mummy
Maze--and asked his friend Reid to assist in a minor way. Reid
inscribed the hieroglyphics on the oversized mummies' feet.</TE>
<TE>   LeVitre and Reid met about five years ago. "I'd never heard the
term 'dog-robber' before we met; the term I'd use for him is 'prop
locator,'" LeVitre says. "I know that when people in the industry
can't find something, they often turn to him. He usually can find it,
and sometimes when he can't, he calls me to make it for him."</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, Reid tries to prepare in advance for calls he
thinks might come. On this day, at his modest tan stucco tract home
on the edge of an industrial area in North Hollywood, he is
phone-scrounging for leather dye because shoe dye didn't work on the
seven dozen pale leather gun belts he's bought and stashed in his
garage, anticipating a surge in combat films. He wants the belts to
be brown and black, ready for the next prop or costume person who
needs to deliver and suddenly realizes he or she can't find them,
can't make them, hasn't the foggiest idea how to get them to the set
on time. So who you gonna call?</TE>
<TE>   Reid says the term "dog-robber" has nothing to do with dogs or
robbers, but comes from military lore--he mumbles something abut an
aide de camp willing to steal a dog's dinner to feed his captain.
People in the prop and wardrobe industry, phoned at random, say
they'd never heard the term until they met Reid.</TE>
<TE>   For a visitor to his home, which is also his office, Reid runs
down a list of films, TV shows and photo shoots on which he's worked,
explaining that on most jobs he provides only a very small amount of
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   But for "Independence Day," for instance, he says he "provided the
principal military wardrobe for the stars. Will Smith's flight suit
had a patch in the wrong place all through the movie," he reports, as
if he'd committed a crime by putting it there. "With military stuff,
you want to be as detailed and correct as possible. They are paying
me for my expertise."</TE>
<TE>   For a TV show called "The Parkers," he was asked to provide
lighted powder compacts like the ones women used in the 1950s.
"Believe it or not, they don't make lighted compacts any more," Reid
says, his expression troubled. He's recalling the exact call, the
frantic voice, the guy who said, "Allen, I don't care what you gotta
do, where you gotta go. I need three lighted compacts by 5 p.m. this
afternoon." Reid proudly says he got them there an hour early.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew someone in the cosmetics business who knew someone else
who knew another person. It took a good few phone calls, but I did
it."</TE>
<TE>   He also does conventions and parties, mostly for the entertainment
industry. And props for print shoots. And sometimes what he does he
considers bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   "Five or six years ago I got a call from Tim Burton's executive
assistant, who said they were doing a combination party--a premiere
for 'Mars Attacks' combined with his girlfriend's birthday, and he
was announcing his engagement to her. He wanted it really wild. So I
got a bunch of dead trees, hung Chinese lanterns from them, had a
fountain spewing multicolored water and a hugely oversize French
bed--I think we found it at Warner Bros. Everyone wound up having
their picture taken on it. Burton said he really liked it."</TE>
<TE>   Bridging Personal, Professional Life</TE>
<TE>   Reid, 52, seems so sincere, so earnestly in love with what he
does, that it's difficult sometimes for him to separate his personal
life from his work. Asked to do the props for a Christmas photo shoot
of the "Everybody Loves Raymond" cast--"they wanted a kind of Norman
Rockwell Christmas gone awry"--he went to his mother's house and
borrowed her carving knives, platters and an afghan she'd made to
make the scene look real.</TE>
<TE>   He has a scrapbook featuring photos of almost everything he's
done. One photo, from People magazine, featured the Taco Bell
Chihuahua, who seems to be sitting on grass right in front of the
Hollywood sign. Of course, there is no flat patch of grass on the
steep scrubby hill on which the sign sits.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me the dog had to be in front of the sign," Reid says.
So he purchased some sod, put it on the roof of his battered truck,
sat the dog on top of the truck and parked it so that it looked, in
the photo, as if the truck was right below the sign.</TE>
<TE>   "These jobs are brain teasers, like doing puzzles," he says. "I'm
a guy who thinks puzzles are fun."</TE>

<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of the odder attempts at an evening-length flamenco
dance-theater piece (think fusion), "Al Cielo con Ella" (Toward
Heaven With Her), under dancer-choreographer Abigail Caro's artistic
direction, misfired Friday in the first of three weekend performances
at Santa Monica's Morgan-Wixon Theatre. At times it seemed more like
flamenco meets the Fillmore, with Jimi Hendrix-type electric guitar
noodlings--albeit technically bright--emanating from the ax of
Miroslav Tadic as he cranked out the late rocker's classic "The Wind
Cries Mary."</LD>
<LD>   What this had to do with the ostensible themes of the divine, the
feminine and Spanish Holy Week (when images of Christ and the Virgin
Mary are placed on floats and paraded through the streets), is a
mystery. But that was Caro's intent: Unsuccessfully weaving Sufi and
Hindu devotional poetry, along with Malleus Maleficarum ("The Witch
Hammer") text--all uttered on tape--this disjointed opus was more
patchwork than passion.</LD>
<LD>   Not only were transitions jarring, with musicians entering and
exiting both sides of the stage, but there were also few authentic
connections between much of the music and dance in the 17-part
program, however well-executed.</LD>
<TE>   Caro, usually intriguing, made a trio for herself, Amanda Navar
and Deborah Greenfield; where Martha Graham-like crouches dominated,
drama didn't. When David Philipson accompanied them on bansuri, North
Indian bamboo flute, the work ebbed into bizarro-land: These were
forms without functions.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, relief came with veteran flamenco dancer Oscar Nieto.
Displaying quicksilver heelwork and slicing arm motions, he brought
much-needed life to the stage in his own solo, as did a fiery Laila
del Monte, dazzling with dipping turns in her choreographed piece. In
addition, singer Antonio de Jerez and guitarists Adam del Monte and
Antonio Triana (all accomplished) contributed to the ill-conceived
evening, which was, alas, poorly lighted by Jack Newalu.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anniversary shows are normally a way to celebrate one's stability,
but in the case of "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher," which
celebrates its fifth anniversary on ABC this Friday, survival has
been the more operative word.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Maher touched off
a firestorm by making reference on his show to "cowardly" U.S.
military action, prompting some major advertisers to pull out and ABC
affiliates to drop the program. There are markets, including
Washington, D.C., that still haven't returned "P.I." to the air, but
Maher survived that incident and became, in some camps, a 1st
Amendment martyr. (In fact, he will be honored later this month at
the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colo., as part of a free
speech tribute.)</LD>
<LD>   For ABC--which acquired "P.I." from Comedy Central, where the show
was developed and originally aired--Maher is a stable ratings force
weeknights at 12:05 a.m. Still, the future of "P.I.," with Maher's
contract set to expire at the end of this year, is unknown.</LD>
<TE>   Asked if the show would have more anniversaries, Marc Gurvitz, one
of the show's executive producers and Maher's manager at
Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, conceded the issue was unresolved, but
said Maher loves doing the show and would like to continue. Calls to
ABC were not returned.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now in its 21st year, the Bob Marley Day Festival is the largest
reggae gathering outside of Jamaica, and Saturday's opening half of
the two-day event drew more than 12,000 fans to the Long Beach Arena.
While such artists as Beenie Man, Sizzla, Junior Reid, Tony Rebel and
Cutty Ranks entertained inside the arena, food vendors (offering all
sorts of African and Caribbean food) and crafts booths competed for
attention outside.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's musical lineup was scheduled to include Luciano, Gregory
Isaacs, Elephant Man and Damian Marley and his band the Ghetto Youth

<LD>Denzel Washington took the gold and Britney Spears the silver in the
weekend box office heat. The bronze went to Peter Pan.</LD>
<LD>   The trio of strong openers and several movies benefiting from
Oscar nominations helped propel ticket sales forward for the start of
the President's Day holiday at the nation's theaters. According to
box office tracker Exhibitor Relations, the top 12 movies grossed an
estimated $109 million for the Friday through Sunday period, slightly
ahead of the same weekend last year.</LD>
<LD>   Although critics didn't much care for the way in which "John Q"
dealt with the shortcomings of the nation's health care system,
audiences seemed primed for the film's message, especially with
Washington leading the charge. Attracting a primarily older male
audience, with a heavy African American component, "John Q" grossed
approximately $20.6 million in its first weekend in 2,466 theaters.
Exit polls, according to New Line co-marketing head Russell Schwartz,
were extremely positive.</LD>
<TE>   As a leading man, Washington is on a winning streak--critics liked
him, if not the film--following Oscar nominated performances in
1999's "The Hurricane" and last year's "Training Day," as well as
"Remember the Titans," his biggest commercial hit to date.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Mariah Carey, who attempted to carry the flimsy melodrama
"Glitter," Spears (and Jive Records, her recording company)
emphasized the ensemble nature of "Crossroads," her starring debut.
While reviewers seemed to be more interested in her presentation than
her acting, they awarded her good scores all around. Playing to a
teenage crowd, especially younger females (girls made up 84% of the
audience, a majority aged 15 and younger), "Crossroads" grossed an
estimated $14.6 million in 2,380 theaters in its first three days,
more than the film's modest $12-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Disney continued its roll of family hits with "Return to Never
Land," a low-budget animated sequel to "Peter Pan." "Never Land" took
flight with $11.8 million over the weekend in 2,605 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Snow Dogs," starring Cuba Gooding Jr., continues to
prosper in 10th place with about $5.8 million in its fifth weekend,
in 2,286 theaters and $67.2 million to date, one of the box office
highlights of the new year.</TE>
<TE>   Disney isn't the only company prospering with family films.
Universal's "Big Fat Liar," starring "Malcolm in the Middle's"
Frankie Muniz, held on with $8.7 million in its second weekend in
2,535 theaters and more than $22 million in its first 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   After debuting in first place, "Collateral Damage" sank to fifth,
dropping 40% from its opening weekend figures to about $9 million in
2,824 theaters and $28.5 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   The World War II era "Hart's War," which suffered mediocre
reviews, debuted to an estimated $8.3 million in 2,459 theaters. The
seventh-place start for the expensive action film starring Bruce
Willis dealt MGM another blow after the dismal showing of last
weekend's "Rollerball," which dropped more than 50% to an estimated
$4 million in its second weekend, in 2,762 theaters. The film has
earned about $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend's fifth major release, the offbeat gross-out comedy
"Super Troopers," performed well considering its minuscule $3-million
budget, grossing about $6.2 million in its first weekend, in 1,778
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down," which didn't make the cut for a best picture
nomination but was cited for director Ridley Scott and screenwriters,
grossed an additional $6.2 million in its fifth weekend, in 2,150
theaters, and more than $95 million to date. By next weekend, "Black
Hawk" is expected to become Scott's third $100-million-plus grosser,
following "Gladiator" and "Hannibal."</TE>
<TE>   Eight Oscar nominations, including best picture, elevated drama "A
Beautiful Mind" by 35% in its ninth weekend to an estimated $8.5
million in 2,065 theaters; the film should cross the $125-million
mark today. The 13 nominations, including best picture, garnered by
"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" gave the film a
boost of about 38%, earning $5 million in 1,507 theaters. Now the
second-highest-grossing film of 2001, with $278 million to date,
"Rings" is expected to earn $300 million in the U.S. and more than
$500 million abroad, making it one of the top-grossing movies of all
time.</TE>
<TE>   Though USA Films didn't report figures Sunday, competing studio
tallies show that "Gosford Park"--nominated for seven Academy
Awards--spiked by almost 35% over the weekend in 837 theaters, adding
an estimated $2.5 million for a total of more than $25 million. Five
nominations for "In the Bedroom" buoyed attendance by 50% as it
expanded from 737 to 1,002 screens, grossing $2.5 million, for a
total of about $23 million. And while "Moulin Rouge" is out on video,
20th Century Fox reports that DVD sales jumped 160% and video rentals
were up 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Nominations for best original screenplay and best actress (Halle
Berry) helped "Monster's Ball" add $2.8 million in 473 theaters, for
almost $8 million total. Sean Penn's best actor nod aided "I Am Sam,"
with about  $3.5 million on 1,259 screens, for nearly $30 million.</TE>

<HD>Traveling the Old Roads of Italy</HD>
<DH>Books, maps, paintings and sculptures from the 18th century
offer a three-part 'grand tour' at the Getty Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three single-gallery exhibitions at the Getty Center tell the story
of a handful of British aristocrats whose passion for things Italian
created a travel craze that became a rite of passage for young men
smitten by the desire to cultivate a taste for life's finer
things--while having some fun. The tourist industry was born.</LD>
<LD>   It all started around the time the United States won its
independence. Ancient Roman artifacts were being excavated hand over
fist in Italy, causing English noblemen and gentry to turn their
attention to the Old World. Plus, the weather was better at the heart
of antiquity, not to mention the cooking.</LD>
<LD>   The best place to start your personal tour is at "Naples and
Vesuvius on the Grand Tour," in the Getty Research Institute Gallery.
The smallest of the shows, it functions like a guidebook or
illustrated map, an introduction to other travelers' journeys and
far-off lands. There are about 30 books, maps, travel albums and a
foldout postcard peep show, nearly all of which were made in the 18th
century, as well as a terra cotta vessel from 300 BC. Because the
books can only be open to one spread each, nearly 30 facsimiles of
other pages--most of them hand-colored etchings--are also displayed.</LD>
<TE>   As a whole, the imagery focuses on the legendary volcano that
destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the first century.
Scenes of lava belching high into the night sky and pouring down the
mountain's side were favored by artists and artisans who produced
spectacular mementos. Lava-covered landscapes, which resemble the
surface of the moon, also appear frequently, as do realistic pictures
of cabinets in which strange rocks and curious fossil souvenirs are
stacked on orderly shelves, each more captivating than the last.</TE>
<TE>   In the 18th century, Naples was one of Europe's great cities, with
Italy's largest opera house and breathtaking vistas of the bay and
Mt. Vesuvius. From 1764 to 1800, Sir William Hamilton served as the
British ambassador to the city, which Englishmen visited as a
diversion from the ponderous splendors of Rome. An amateur scientist,
Hamilton led expeditions to the rim of the active volcano, collected
shells, stones, antique fragments and objects, and published many
illustrated catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   The four volumes that document his vase collection are the first
color-plate books in the history of art. Published in 1776, each
luxurious tome is on display here, open to pages that highlight the
range of the books' artistry, including a boldly printed
frontispiece; an engraving of a nattily dressed troupe plundering a
grave; and a meandering yet sensible paragraph extolling the virtues
of skepticism when it comes to knowing the truth about history.</TE>
<TE>   This gallery's highlight is a wall-size map of Naples and the
surrounding countryside by Nicolo Carletti and Giuseppe Aloja. Made
of 35 engravings that form a grid, the bird's-eye view identifies
every building, alley, piazza, field and dock in the city and its
environs, an astonishingly imaginative act before airplanes made such
perspectives commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   Go next to "Rome on the Grand Tour," the centerpiece of the three
Getty shows. Its 65 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, carved
gems, sketchbooks, letters, pocket-guides and plaster souvenirs flesh
out the world called to mind by the two-dimensional images in "Naples
and Vesuvius." The wide variety of objects that the grand tourists
picked up along the way emphasizes the time, energy and money they
invested in their horse-and-carriage journeys, which usually involved
an entourage (including a tutor) and often lasted for up to eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Eternal City boasts such mythical landmarks as the
Colosseum, the Forum and St. Peter's Basilica (all of which are
featured in idealized and romanticized prints), the fireworks
displays at the Castel Sant' Angelo seem to have captured the
imaginations of the young visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Francesco Panini's hand-colored etching of the scene, which
approaches the subtlety of an oil painting, still makes an indelible
impression. Another view, by Louis Jean Desprez (who applied
watercolor and gouache to an etching by Francesco Piranesi) is even
more dazzling in its depiction of the evening's climax: 5,000 rockets
fired into the sky from a giant spinning wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Three portraits show the range of skill and seriousness that
painters and clients brought to this commemorative art. Pompeo
Batoni's full-length oil on canvas has it down to a science: the
23-year-old John Chetwynd Talbot, who would grow up to be First Earl
Talbot, looks debonair and sensitive, framed by an urn, statue, ruin
and his loyal cocker spaniel.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Etienne Liotard's pastel, "Portrait of John, Lord
Mountstuart, Later Fourth Earl and First Marquess of Bute" is more
formulaic, its swiftly painted setting a collage of objects that
symbolize taste and refinement. Although more care was taken with the
19-year-old's face and body, it still looks as if George Washington's
head has been stuck on Oscar Wilde's body, or at least into an outfit
he'd love to wear.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Anton Raphael Mengs' "Portrait of William Burton
Conyngham" is done with such facility and devotion that it seems to
capture the spirit of its sitter, a 21-year-old Irishman whose
fresh-faced well-being is uncorrupted by any sense of entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   Pier Leone Ghezzi's "Caricature of Cavaliere Ricci and Monsieur de
Gravelle" depicts a couple of misshapen noblemen dressed in their
finest. The pen-and-ink drawing, like those still made at sightseeing
destinations all over the world, suggests the love-hate relationship
that often grows between locals and tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Canaletto's oil painting of the Colosseum seen through the Arch of
Constantine looks fabulous from across the room. Up close, however,
its rudimentary illusionism is glaringly evident, revealing that it
was cranked out swiftly (if skillfully), an early version of a
postcard.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, numerous landscapes drawn in chalk and painted in
watercolor, including a stunning pair of city views by Giovanni
Battista Lusieri, are so exquisite that it's hard to imagine they're
souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   But when you think about how much effort it took for 18th century
Englishmen to get to Rome, it makes sense that they'd want images
whose creation required ample time, talent and training.</TE>
<TE>   A vitrine filled with engraved gems and raised cameos juxtaposes
works from antiquity and their modern counterparts. These easily
transported mementos were all the rage in their day. Sometimes the
new-and-improved versions became more desirable (and expensive) than
the originals. At other times, unscrupulous sellers crafted fakes.</TE>
<TE>   Here and elsewhere in the show you see that 18th century artists
were copying 2,000-year-old Roman works, which were themselves copies
of ancient Greek artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   The third exhibition, "Drawing Italy in the Age of the Grand
Tour," is a more traditional theme show loosely based on the Italian
countryside. Comprising 25 drawings, 10 prints and one oil painting,
it has little to do with the specifics of a grand tour, but it
provides the museum with an opportunity to show off its riches.</TE>
<TE>   In the dimly lit gallery, Giovanni Battista Piranesi's fantastic
edifices have the presence of Hollywood sets for gothic nightmares.
Francesco Zuccarelli's chalk, ink and gouache drawing of shepherds
resting beneath a tree is an idealized daydream.</TE>
<TE>   The romance of the sea is palpable in Marco Ricci's rare
gouache-on-leather depiction of fishing boats in a storm. Jean-Honore
Fragonard celebrates homey sentimentality, bringing consummate
draftsmanship to mundane barnyard labors.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo is well represented, with a comic image
of children's theater, a rare architectural rendering and a pair of
gorgeous religious scenes, the holy family fleeing to Egypt and Mary
Magdalene anointing Christ's feet.</TE>
<TE>   The clarity of sharp observation suffuses Jean-Joseph-Xavier
Bidauld's gem of a painting, in which a stone bridge can be glimpsed
on a tree-covered hillside. Drawn on site in England, Canaletto's
image of Warwick Castle reverses the direction in which grand
tourists traveled.</TE>
<TE>   Although tourism today is as common as any other middle-class
pastime, it is still a historical anomaly when seen in the full sweep
of history.</TE>
<TE>   Before grand tours put people on the road, we left home only to
find food, go on religious pilgrimages, open trade routes or fight
wars. Which makes, the secular aspirations and social satisfactions
of the grand tour all the more extraordinary.</TE>

<HD>Feet Propel 'Black Choreographers' Feats</HD>
<DH>The Saturday program at this year's event proves to be a
better showcase for the dancers than for the dance-makers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the program booklet at the Los Angeles Theatre Center read
"Black Choreographers Showcase 2002," the Saturday installment of
this four-performance series belonged body and soul to dancers rather
than dance-makers.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the new works leaned heavily on writings by Langston
Hughes, Maya Angelou, Jerry Quickley and others, with the
choreographers providing little more than a gloss on the spoken word:
a light show, if you like, decorating the writers' profoundly
expressed insights and feelings.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, none of the showcased choreographers invented the
movement styles they explored, and none developed, extended or
personalized them significantly. So their pieces looked imitative,
even generic.</LD>
<TE>   Only in Trina Parks' easygoing but cogent summary of Katherine
Dunham technique did the Saturday audience glimpse true bedrock
creativity. A great star who is still underappreciated for her
contributions to American dance, Dunham distilled a distinctive dance
idiom from a number of sources early in the 20th century. No mere
historical relic, that idiom looked more potent in the performance of
Bert Woods and, to a lesser extent, Sloan Robinson than much of the
hand-me-down jazz/modern dances on the rest of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Delane Vaughan's ragged and ridiculously overextended
hip-hop demonstration--a segment that sent the program past the
three-hour mark and prompted plenty of exits--the dancing often
proved not merely exciting but redemptive.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn's own moody "One for Daddy-O" jazz solo boasted remarkably
powerful, authoritative arm and shoulder movement, though his mastery
of steps and balances remained uneven--a problem also evident in his
underpowered hip-hop legwork.</TE>
<TE>   Three pieces by Maura Owens Townsend's Project 21 Performing Arts
Consortium succeeded on the strength of the performers' sustained
fervor. In the solo "The Letter," Morgan Thomas made something very
personal and fresh out of the evening's big choreographic cliche:
dancers writhing on the floor and reaching up in one solo after
another.</TE>
<TE>   In "Grandmothers," Thomas, Townsend and Wendy Baity pulled the
emotions of Angelou's poem into their bodies, anchoring the trio
through intense poses more than motion.</TE>
<TE>   Quickley's troubled but ultimately positive rap on current events
overwhelmed everything else in "Untitled," but the dancing in this
Project 21 jazz sextet had enough technical security to look
respectable in an evening rich in prowess. And nobody displayed that
prowess more flamboyantly than the JazzAntiqua dancers in Pat
Taylor's five-part "Silhouettes in Motion: Vignettes From the Big
Train Project."</TE>
<TE>   "When Sue Wears Red" established Katisha Adams as Queen of "Big
Train" Attitude, and the opening "Lennox Avenue" solo introduced the
skillful, effortless and sincere Charles Zacharie as Mr. Oppressed
Nice Guy.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Watson embodied balletic flash and found his ideal
complement in the vibrant Terrica Banks, a dancer versatile enough to
match his bravura attacks yet also make an off-the-rack,
lonely-but-slinky "Blue Monday" solo utterly convincing.</TE>
<TE>   But the tense, feral desperation of Tommie Evans in the "White"
solo took the whole work into a much edgier and less predictable
direction, just as the closing "Room Enough" solo allowed Jason Lewis
room enough for an astonishingly volatile yet somehow noble communion
with the lyrics to "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nelson read the Hughes and historical texts effectively and
provided vocal rhythms to accompany the "American Gothic" duet for
Townsend and Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Drummer Ricardo Alvalos brought his years of Dunham experience to
the Parks segment, and the JazzAntiqua piece featured the artistry of
Marcus Shelby (bass, original music and arrangements), Lorca Hart
(drums), Ark Sano (piano), Evan Francis (sax) and Brian Swartz
(trumpet).</TE>
<TE>   Produced by the city's Cultural Affairs Department in celebration
of Black History Month, the event suffered from crude and often
ruinous sound and lighting. Robinson served as host.</TE>

<HD>Deft Comedic Touches Add Extra Sparkle to 'Stella by
Starlight'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With "Stella by Starlight," Laguna Playhouse presents its second U.S.
premiere of a comedy by the Irish writer Bernard Farrell. This one is
better than the initial outing in 2000, "Kevin's Bed." With plenty of
sharply observed comedy that goes beyond one-liners, "Stella by
Starlight" twinkles often enough that more Farrell premieres are
warranted.</LD>
<LD>   Like the plays of Richard Dresser, an American whose work Laguna
has also been championing, Farrell takes gleeful aim at the foibles
of the upwardly striving middle class--but also establishes sympathy
for at least some of the strivers. Both writers share the milieu of
the great Alan Ayckbourn, and if they aren't yet up to the English
writer's standard, they're moving closer.</LD>
<LD>   With her husband, Dermot, and daughter Tara, 43-year-old Stella
has left the urbanity of Dublin for a remote converted farmhouse in
the hills. Apparently supported by the severance pay from his last
corporate job, Dermot keeps busy, refurbishing the fixer-upper and
indulging in his passion for astronomy. But Stella, who had worked at
a bank in Dublin, feels cut off and alone.</LD>
<TE>   The reasons for the move, which was Dermot's idea, are never
explicitly discussed. But we can surmise that one of the attractions
was the brightness of the rural night skies. He has installed a
couple of telescopes in his newly built conservatory. On this
particular night, his fellow amateur astronomers on the Internet have
asked him to take photos of a comet as it crashes into Jupiter.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the only impending crash. Arriving soon are another
married couple, Geraldine and Paul. She's Stella's friend from the
bank, and he was once Dermot's professional colleague. However,
Dermot is skeptical of Paul's ability to survive the downsizing that
cost Dermot his job. Further complicating matters is the memory of
who formerly went out with whom, years ago. Stella and Paul were a
couple--and so, briefly, were Geraldine and Dermot.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage Tara, too, has ambitions for the evening. She's going to a
dance with a man her parents have never met, and she has embellished
his credentials.</TE>
<TE>   At first Stella is the only passive character. Her husband is a
control freak who scornfully dismisses her attempts to help, insists
that she wear uncomfortable contact lenses instead of glasses,
and--just before the guests arrive--assigns her to take a quick walk
in the night air so that Geraldine and Paul will be impressed with
the advantages of rustic recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Stella's headaches mount when Paul starts wooing her. Even gal pal
Geraldine needs a big favor.</TE>
<TE>   The fuses of all the other characters are shorter that Stella's,
so much so that we wonder when Stella, too, might ignite. Actress
Amelia White charts the changes in Stella's temperament with a fine,
subtle hand. Pudgy in frame, blinking from her uncomfortable
contacts, thrust into one scrape or dilemma after another, she
engenders her full share of sympathetic laughter.</TE>
<TE>   In casting the statuesque Bairbre Dowling as Geraldine, director
Andrew Barnicle found a nimble farceur who's physically the opposite
of White, and the contrast makes their conversations funnier.</TE>
<TE>   Dermot and Paul are also opposite in many ways, yet they are
equally unsympathetic. Warren Sweeney's Dermot is a bitter ball of
pent-up tensions trying, on occasion, to appear relaxed and
comfortable. He's a little too unlikable to make his last-scene
repentance and reconciliation wholly credible. Thomas MacGreevy
doesn't get very far beneath Paul's oily surface and swallows a few
of his more critical lines.</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin Shannon plays the aggravated teenager well, but Joel Moore
virtually steals the show in his scenes as her unprepossessing beau.
With his angular limbs, big nose and goofy outfit, he looks like a
younger Irish cousin of "Seinfeld's" Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Richard Odle's sets and Julie Keen's costumes help outline
the characters' keen awareness of social status. The depiction of the
comet crash isn't quite as graphic as the script suggests, but it
works well enough.</TE>

<HD>ABT Soloists Embrace 'Swan Lake's' Passion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In creating a new production of "Swan Lake" for American Ballet
Theatre two years ago, artistic director Kevin McKenzie borrowed
innovations from a number of previous stagings.</LD>
<LD>   During the prelude, for instance, he showed Rothbart turning
Odette into a swan--an idea from the celebrated, influential Vladimir
Bourmeister version of the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   McKenzie even recycled a concept from the radical Matthew Bourne
modern dance "Swan Lake" of 1995: a nasty, sensual youth seducing all
the women at the ball, including the Queen Mother.</LD>
<TE>   But, at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday,
McKenzie's patchwork edition proved far less noteworthy than his
casting: international stars Nina Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca
dancing together for the first time on any local stage.</TE>
<TE>   Each had visited the Southland recently at the head of other
ensembles: She as the prima ballerina of the Bolshoi, he as the
leading light of Ballet Argentino. Together they provided a memorable
sampling of what New Yorkers have cheered season after
season--Ananiashvili's refinement of style meshing perfectly with
Bocca's dramatic intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Ananiashvili's mastery of mime may have been the great surprise of
her performance, since the Soviet-era productions she grew up on
invariably replaced passages of traditional 19th century gesture with
nonstop dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "Swan Lake" contains many such passages, and Ananiashvili deftly
integrated them with the prevailing musical impetus whenever
possible, her hands floating through the sign language as if dancing
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Her bold, high extensions, deep backbends and ability to highlight
all the details of the choreography without diminishing its flow made
the lakeside scenes impressive even without the sense of mystery and
suffering she exuded.</TE>
<TE>   Odette, however, should represent a heightened projection of the
style of the swan corps, and that ensemble danced wretchedly Friday,
inflicting blunt prose on passages that should have matched her
eloquent poetry.</TE>
<TE>   A glittering, carnal Odile, Ananiashvili made the flurry of
multiple turns in Bocca's arms during the Black Swan adagio a
striking contrast to Odette's exquisitely slow unfolding in his arms
during the White Swan pas de deux.</TE>
<TE>   Bocca partnered her passionately, and always kept this "Swan Lake"
focused on Siegfried's emotional journey. He also displayed glints of
the brilliant virtuosity for which he's famed--particularly in a
sequence of turns near the end of the Black Swan coda.</TE>
<TE>   At age 35, however, he couldn't always make the bravura look easy,
and there were enough hunched shoulders and unstretched jumps to
leave the performance below the level of his phenomenal dancing in
the less classically exposed "Tango en el Maipo" last season in
Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other soloists Friday had been previously reviewed in
the Orange County engagement. But Joaquin de Luz brought his sunny
buoyancy and technical finesse to the expanded duties of Benno, the
Prince's friend. Andrew Mogrelia again conducted.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ojai Music Festival has announced that Tom Morris, executive
director of the Cleveland Orchestra, will succeed Ernest Fleischmann
as artistic director beginning with the June 2004 festival.</LD>
<LD>   In his 15 years in Cleveland, Morris has maintained  that
ensemble's prominence as the orchestra generally considered America's
finest.</LD>
<LD>   Fleischmann, who has headed the Ojai Festival since 1998, has
attracted increasing national and international attention  to the
small but significant weekend of June concerts,  inviting the likes
of conductors Pierre Boulez, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Simon Rattle to
create adventurous programs.</LD>
<TE>   Morris, who will also continue managing the Cleveland Orchestra
and commute to Ojai, praised Fleischmann for having "set the bar very
high indeed, and I intend to work hard to keep it there."</TE>

<HD>Harrowing Look at Slaves' Passage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sold into slavery, the unnamed African who narrates "The Middle
Passage" describes himself as "just another black body in a sea of
dark despair."</LD>
<LD>   Yet while his forced voyage to the New World is filled with filth
and sickness, it is also suffused with the beauty of the pastel sky
and the dancing, azure sea. Nature retains her purity, even as she is
forced to swallow the bodies of the many dead who are tossed into her
waters.</LD>
<LD>   This splendor, combined with the poetry of the voice-over
narration, makes the film easier to watch, yet renders it all the
more haunting as it plays this month on HBO (including tonight at
9:45).</LD>
<TE>   Originally a French-language production by Martinique filmmaker
Guy Deslauriers, "The Middle Passage" arrived at last year's Pan
African Film Festival here with a different English-language
voice-over than it now carries. This one is written by novelist
Walter Mosley and spoken by Djimon Hounsou, of the Steven Spielberg
middle passage film "Amistad."</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified narrator could be any of the men lying in chains
on the bare-wood berths in the ship's dank hold. He is a ghost,
whispering into the viewer's ear. Determined to record history in its
entirety, he holds accountable the Africans who captured and sold
members of rival tribes, as well as the slavers and buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The hour-and-20-minute film progresses at a stately pace, with
some scenes unfolding in an artfully abstracted blur, to the
shimmering elegy of violins. But the horror of the vomiting, the rats
and the whippings are never long from view.</TE>
<TE>   This was a holocaust that lasted nearly 400 years, with more than
half of the occupants of some ships perishing during the voyage.
Those who survived became "a new race, a new people"--strong and,
ultimately, unconquerable.</TE>

<HD>'John Q.'s' Public Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of Americans watched this weekend as a
desperate father held a hospital emergency room at gunpoint and
demanded a heart transplant for his dying son.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately for everyone, it all happened in a movie, "John Q,"
which opened Friday. The movie stars Denzel Washington as John Q.
Archibauld, an Illinois factory worker who resorts to hostage-taking
after learning that the hospital won't even request an organ for his
son without sufficient insurance coverage, which he doesn't have.</LD>
<LD>   In his scramble to save his son, Archibauld runs into one
unbending bureaucrat after another. The hospital won't help him raise
funds. The factory, trying to save money, has downgraded his
insurance to an HMO policy that pays only a fraction of the
operation's cost. Even Medicaid, the government assistance program
for the poor, turns away the Archibaulds because their meager income
is too high to qualify for the program. As his son's heart winds
down, tick by tick, John Q. sells off his possessions and becomes
increasingly frantic.</LD>
<TE>   Though medical experts object to some of the details of the story,
they say it draws attention to issues worthy of public discussion:
the role of employers in determining health coverage, the importance
of understanding your insurance policy and, perhaps most important,
the huge disparities in our current health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   Strictly as a depiction of transplant medicine, the story is
farfetched, experts say. For one thing, most children whose families
are in financial need would qualify for state or federal funds to
help pay for a heart transplant operation, said Larry Levitt, a vice
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park health policy
organization. There are also private funding groups across the
nation, and many hospitals have staff trained to help families tap
those resources, said Anne Paschke, a spokeswoman for the United
Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va., which coordinates organ
procurement throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue highlighted in the movie is a type of insurance that
places caps on medical benefits. The policy that John Q. has through
his employer sets a $20,000 maximum cap on benefits, meaning that any
medical expenses above that amount are not paid. But health benefits
consultants say that employers rarely stick their workers with a
capped policy without including some provision for a catastrophe. "A
cap of $20,000 would be very low for an employer plan," Levitt says.
"More commonly, we see caps of $200,000 or $500,000."</TE>
<TE>   Many people fall through the cracks: 38 million Americans have no
health insurance, and many are working adults who couldn't afford an
organ transplant. Some doctors believe that "John Q." could strike a
chord with audiences because it illustrates some of the inequities of
the U.S. health system. "There's a huge public concern about
coverage, about how much health-care costs; and here's a man fighting
for his son's life," said Dr. Hillel Laks, director of the heart-lung
transplant program at UCLA. "I think it's going to hit a very big
audience."</TE>
<TE>   And HMOs, which come in for a share of the criticism in the movie,
apparently still make good villains. A current best-selling novel,
"The Oath," by John Lescroart, centers on an HMO executive who dies
in a suspicious accident. And an upcoming made-for-television movie
on Showtime is based on the true story of an executive at a health
insurance company who blew the whistle on questionable business
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Before "John Q." even premiered, the insurance industry launched
an ad campaign framing the movie's message as a plea to cover the
uninsured, not an attack on HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   In fact "John Q." blasts the entire health-care system, also
shedding some light on the role that employers play in deciding which
types of health plans their workers will choose from. As the economy
remains weak and health costs rise sharply, employers already have
begun shifting more cost to workers, insurers say.</TE>
<TE>   In such an environment, Kaiser's Levitt said, it's increasingly
likely that employers will consider the type of policies that John Q.
has, with lower benefit caps. "It's a natural place to cut down on
insurance costs," Levitt said.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects to need an organ transplant, of course, and few of
us can contemplate a medical catastrophe when we're healthy.</TE>
<TE>   But if "John Q." succeeds in reaching a large audience, it may
well get people with insurance to look closely at what their policy
covers and what it doesn't, health experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for people to know what their insurance pays
for, and to know they can do something about it," said UCLA's Laks.
"John Q. could have gone to the company and said, 'I don't like this
policy. I want to spend $100 more and get better insurance.' If he's
willing to go shoot people to save his son, why can't he pay a little
extra a month to make sure he's covered?"</TE>

<LD>As a kid I used to love reading Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie
mysteries--but somewhere along the line these got dropped for less
fun tomes like "Fundamentals of Biochemistry." Now, after a visit to
a local crime bookstore, I'm laden once again with unimproving
literature--and much better informed to boot.</LD>
<LD>   I'd gone to Book'em Mysteries in South Pasadena to learn if all
our new knowledge about drugs and human biology had made any
difference to the types of poisons used in crime books. Have we moved
on, I wondered, since Dame Agatha's days? The classic methods are
alive and well, said bookseller Jean Utley--but there's a lot more
variety too: "Everybody's using everything nowadays--it's not just
straight arsenic anymore," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Poisoning, says Utley, is as popular as ever--often cropping up in
so-called gardening mysteries (sometimes complete with gardening
tips), botanical mysteries (with info on plants), even kitchen
mysteries--some with recipes, no less.</LD>
<TE>   Take herbs. As the herbal supplement health movement has grown,
so, has the trend for more "natural" murders in books, she says.</TE>
<TE>   And take drugs. The general public is a lot more savvy about
pharmaceuticals, side effects and adverse drug reactions, and these
things are showing up in books as well. Not that this trend is
entirely new: In a 1971 book called "Old Cheese," Swedish
psychiatrist/writer Ulf Durling killed a fictional victim by feeding
him Chianti and old cheese and mixing a class of antidepressants with
his blood-pressure medication. Each heightened the man's already high
blood pressure--enough, together, to give the victim a stroke.
Chancy, but elegant.</TE>
<TE>   Writers do a lot of research in their quest for accuracy and the
perfect poison, says local crime writer Rochelle Krich (who has
variously bumped off victims with curare, strychnine, arsenic,
digitalis and by combining certain medications with adverse
interactions.) She and local members of Sisters in Crime--a
crime-writers organization--get together regularly and hear talks
from toxicologists, forensics experts and the like. They also consult
books, such as "Deadly Doses: A Writer's Guide to Poisons" (Writers
Digest Books, 1990) by Serita Deborah Stevens and Anne Klarner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Sampling of the Tried and True</TE>
<TE>   Next we called Kathleen Rodgers, a professor at USC's school of
medicine, who gamely dipped into her pharmacology and toxicology
texts to explain how various tried and true poisons do their deeds.
Here, from Rodgers and some of our own reading, are a sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * Strychnine interferes with the action of certain nerve cells.
This causes other nerves to go into overdrive, sending muscles into
spasm.</TE>
<TE>   * Hemlock is a poisonous plant known since way back. The Greek
philosopher Socrates was forced to drink a cup of its juice as his
death sentence. Hemlock contains the alkaloid coniine, which is a
sedative and relaxes muscles, kind of the opposite of what strychnine
does. For that reason, it's been recommended by some as an antidote
to strychnine (though "this seems like a fine line to tread,"
comments a co-worker.)</TE>
<TE>   * Ricin is a plant toxin derived from castor beans. It was
famously used to kill a Bulgarian defector in 1978 when a specially
rigged "umbrella" was used to shoot a ricin pellet into his leg.
Ricin interferes with cells' abilities to make proteins.</TE>
<TE>   * Curare (used by Krich in one of her books) paralyzes skeletal
muscles--the muscles we use to move about and breathe with.
Historically, it was used in nonlethal doses as a muscle relaxant
during surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * Arsenic, a heavy metal, wreaks its havoc by interfering with the
ability of cells to process energy, essentially starving them. The
Borgias, a famous Italian family, used arsenic to assassinate
people--some have even suggested that Napoleon was offed with
arsenic-tainted wine.</TE>
<TE>   * Cyanide, that Christie classic, can be found in tiny amounts in
pits of fruit such as apricot, apple, peach and almond. It also
interferes with energy-production in cells.</TE>
<TE>   * Oleander and foxglove plants both contain chemicals that boost
the pumping of the heart and--in high doses--can lethally interfere
with heart function.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we stumbled upon a true 1977 account of a nurse who
diagnosed an illness from a crime book. The gravely ill child, whose
sickness was a mystery, had symptoms just like the thallium-poisoned
victims in an Agatha Christie book she was reading.</TE>
<TE>   There. What good would "Fundamentals of Biochemistry" have been in
that situation?</TE>

<HD>Fighting Cancer, the Elusive Foe</HD>
<DH>Thirty years ago, the U.S. set the goal of finding a cure.
Today, some patients are living longer, but researchers' aims have
changed as they learn more about the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The goal is this: Someday cancer patients will be able to live with
their disease as a manageable chronic illness, just as millions of
people today deal with high blood pressure, heart disease and
diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   When President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act about three
decades ago, many people described the fight against cancer in terms
of another ambitious national mission. "If we can put a man on the
moon," many Americans asked at the time, "why can't we cure cancer?"</LD>
<LD>   But the moon landing was the successful application of
well-understood scientific and engineering principles. Cancer, by
contrast, was then a profound mystery that only now is beginning to
yield some of its secrets. We have learned in the past generation
that cancer is no single disease with a single cure, only myriad
conditions with cells gone wrong, reacting differently in different
patients. But the hard work of scientists, the determination of
doctors, and the struggles of patients have yielded welcome progress
during the past generation:</LD>
<TE>   * There is a new and burgeoning field of cancer prevention, with
promising tests underway of compounds to prevent the dread disease.
Tamoxifen shows dramatic progress in cutting the rate of breast
cancer in high-risk women. Major studies are underway to see if
selenium, vitamin E and other substances can reduce prostate cancer
in men.</TE>
<TE>   * Screening makes a tremendous difference. The mortality rates for
breast cancer and prostate cancer are dropping because massive
publicity has persuaded millions of women to get mammograms and men
to get the PSA test for prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   * New targeted therapies will enable patients to survive and
thrive without the terrible side effects of chemotherapy and
radiation.</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, a cancer diagnosis was a veritable death
sentence. Now, about half of those who get cancer will survive the
disease--and die of some other cause. Researchers and doctors are
focused on helping the other 50% who now are killed by their cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting cancer is still a deadly battle, but we have more and
better weapons because our understanding is deeper than it was 30
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But we have learned some sobering lessons, too. Cancer is not a
single disease with a single cure to be discovered. There will be no
magic bullet or miraculous vaccine to deal with cancer. Rather, the
battle will continue on many fronts. Vaccines may be found for some
forms of cancer. Therapies will be tailored to individual patients
because of their unique combinations of genes and disease. And
prevention efforts will be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   The sobering reality, however, is that billions of dollars have
been spent without a clear victory in the war, and billions more must
be directed to the battle. The early detection means better survival
rates for the major cancers: breast, prostate, colorectal. But for
some of the deadliest forms of cancer, such as lung and liver, the
progress of research may be measured by the improvement in a
patient's quality of life after diagnosis, rather than survival
rates.</TE>
<TE>   A generation of research into cell biology has yielded a key
insight: The body replaces cells every day, turning cell production
on and off just as a thermostat switches itself on and off to
maintain a comfortable room temperature. If a thermostat gets stuck,
"the temperature would continue to rise, and we'd get uncomfortably
hot," Dr. Brian Druker, director of the Leukemia Center at Oregon
Health and Science University, said at a recent seminar on the 30th
anniversary of the war on cancer. "That's exactly what happens in a
cancer," he said. "It's as though a thermostat gets stuck on. The
cells grow, they divide, they multiply, and form a tumor."</TE>
<TE>   Adopting the war analogy, the traditional treatments for
cancer--using radiation and chemotherapy--are like artillery shells,
destroying everything in the area, good and bad cells alike. The new
treatments can be likened to smart bombs, targeting the cells that
have mutated into cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, the new compounds turn off the growth factors in the
cancer cells, preventing them from multiplying and spreading through
the body. Two notable recent successes are Herceptin, developed at
UCLA and used against breast cancer, and Gleevec, used against
chronic myeloid leukemia. The use of Gleevec "is an amazing thing,
taking a pill once a day. I wouldn't have believed it if you had told
me 10 years ago, that we would have a pill that targets specific
cancer cells with so few side effects," said Judith C. Gasson, a
professor of medicine and biological chemistry and director of UCLA's
Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We have worked on this for 30 years, knowing that if we could
understand the molecular defects that lead to cancer, we would be
smart enough to develop tools to block those genes," Gasson said.
Meanwhile, scientists have discovered more than 100 genetic markers
that could indicate which individuals are predisposed to developing
certain types of cancer. Although there is no absolute way to be sure
who will become a cancer patient, doctors will eventually be able to
identify those at high risk, said Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of
cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The analogy, he says, is to cardiologists. At one time, they just
treated heart attacks. Now, they can use the risk markers--high blood
pressure and high cholesterol--to figure who is a candidate for a
heart attack, and then use medication and proper diet to bring down
those risks. For those at risk of prostate cancer, for example, the
tests underway with selenium and vitamin E will determine if those
compounds can be an effective means of prevention, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has brought a seeming paradox. If we are doing so much
better, why does the cancer rate increase? But this seeming bad news
is really encouraging: It reflects the early detection and diagnosis,
which increase the chances for survival in most of the major cancers.
The good news is that the death rate from cancer has been dropping,
declining by about 1% a year, starting in the early 1990s, according
to National Cancer Institute figures. The incidence of breast cancer
rose 32% between 1973 and 1998, while prostate cancer climbed 116%,
according to NCI figures. It doesn't reflect a deadly epidemic, but
rather increased awareness that leads to demand for testing and early
diagnosis. "The diagnosis of breast cancer continues to go up, and
this is typically related to the screening, which finds cancer in the
early stages," said Brenda K. Edwards, associate director of research
at the NCI.</TE>
<TE>   In a previous era, many people would have been stricken with the
disease but not diagnosed until too late to be helped. Now they have
the benefits of screening, the detection that brings treatment. The
death rates from prostate cancer and breast cancer have been falling
significantly since 1995, Edwards noted. Colorectal cancer death
rates also have been declining.</TE>
<TE>   Some cancers, however, are less amenable to successful treatment,
and early detection may not improve longevity.</TE>
<TE>   "You can move the cancer diagnosis earlier, but you may not have a
treatment that extends someone's life," said Leslie Bernstein,
research professor and senior associate dean at USC's Keck School of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose we diagnose a lung cancer early, in 2002, and treat it
and the person dies in 2006," she said. "Without screening, the
diagnosis would have been made in 2004 when the person came in with
clinical symptoms like a heavy cough. Yet for this person, treatment
is ineffective and no matter what you do, he will die in 2006. So it
is an error to say that the early screening improved the survival
rate."</TE>
<TE>   Even as the tools of science get better, however, the population
of cancer patients inevitably grows larger. Many of those who would
have died at comparatively young ages in earlier eras from heart
disease or strokes are living long lives, and coming down with
cancers that strike past age 65.</TE>
<TE>   One's susceptibility to cancer grows as a person ages. He is more
susceptible to cancer because he has more years of exposure to
carcinogens, and his immune system is weaker in defending against
disease. There is more time for something to go wrong in the
thermostat.</TE>
<TE>   Cancer, therefore, is looming as a particular threat to the
massive baby boom generation, Americans born in the years 1946
through 1964. The oldest of the baby boomers are nearing 60, when the
incidence of cancer begins rising sharply. "Each decade your risk of
developing cancer increases," said UCLA's Gasson.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists' ultimate weapon against cancer will likely be their
deeper knowledge of the working of the genetic system. The mapping of
all the genes in the human body may lead to an understanding of which
genes are triggering the cancers.</TE>
<TE>   There will be more focus on an individual's genetic makeup, and
how that makeup affects whether certain exposures increase cancer
risk. "Some women may have a genetic profile that metabolizes
estrogen into a more potent form, paving the way for development of
breast cancers," Bernstein said. "Once we can determine what this
profile is, we can predict which women can safely take estrogen for
menopause and which ones cannot." Armed with individual genetic
profiles and family histories, she said, doctors could be more
precise in their diagnosis and treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "We are hoping to develop ways to differentiate those cancers that
will progress from those that won't," Bernstein said. "This would
tell us which women we will have to monitor carefully, and which
women will have nothing to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that today's scientists and researchers are
much better-armed soldiers for the war on cancer, with superior
weapons, and much improved intelligence about the nature of the
enemy. But they are more modest than their peers of 30 years ago, who
too often rushed to proclaim victory.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers in the war against cancer need "humility at certain
times, and especially a capacity to speak freely about what we still
don't know, and how much remains to be done ... ," Dr. Samuel Broder,
a former director of the National Cancer Institute, cautioned
recently. "Patience, scholarship and quiet determination are really
what matter. Cancer cells, I think, are unimpressed by rhetoric,
bravado, slogans or hype."</TE>

<LD>Rockers and rollers that clutter gym floors are designed to make
stomach crunch exercises easier with less strain on the neck because
the machines support the weight of the head. But a study in the
Journal of Strength and Conditioning found that exercisers get more
for their effort by doing crunches the old-fashioned way.</LD>
<LD>   William A. Sands, a sports medicine expert at California Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks, and his colleagues videotaped several
angles created from the neck to the hip when 20 exercisers did
crunches on their own and on two roller-type devices (AB Trainer and
Weider AB Shaper) and two pivot-type devices (ABS 45 HealthRider and
ABS HealthRider). Computer analysis of the videotapes revealed that
greatest total range of motion occurred with the do-it-yourself
crunch. Second place went to the ABS HealthRider.</LD>
<LD>   The greater the range of motion, the more effective an exercise is
in developing muscular endurance, said Sands. And yes, he adds, when
doing crunches that probably translates to tighter, flatter abs.</LD>

<TE>   A Kinder, Gentler Way Than Surgery to Reduce Breast Size</TE>
<TE>   Breast reduction brings tremendous psychological relief to many
women, but the conventional surgery creates scars and requires a
prolonged healing period.</TE>
<TE>   Liposuction, a much gentler procedure, is becoming a more popular
alternative when the object is to remove small to moderate amounts of
fat from the breasts. Now it may become an even more appealing option
because an Italian study has shown that using ultrasound immediately
before liposuction allows removal of greater amounts of fat.</TE>
<TE>   Ultrasonic vibrations create pressure waves that emulsify fat
cells but don't affect sensory nerves, blood vessels, milk glands or
other breast tissue. A study of 120 people who had
ultrasonic-assisted liposuction at the University of Arcona in Italy,
published recently in Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, a U.S. medical
journal, found that the results were good and there were no major
complications.</TE>
<TE>   Liposuction, which can be done through a 0.25-inch incision in the
crease of the breast, can reduce the size of the fatty breasts about
one to two cup sizes, said Dr. James Baker Jr., chair of the American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery committee on breast surgery.
When liposuction is combined with ultrasound, breasts can be made up
to four cup sizes smaller.</TE>
<TE>   The plastic surgery society expects to release a position
statement next month endorsing the procedure in women. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approved the procedure for breast reduction
in men last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biotin Rediscovered Through Studies on Pregnant Women</TE>
<TE>   Biotin, a B vitamin, has been called the "forgotten nutrient." Egg
yolks, green leafy vegetables and liver are believed to be good
sources, but scientists aren't sure which foods contain it in the
greatest quantities. Biotin may get more recognition now that
research indicates about half of pregnant women are mildly deficient
in the nutrient. Doctors suspect that pregnancy itself, rather than a
lack of biotin in the diet, is the cause of the deficiency.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition, 26 pregnant women who excreted increased amounts of 3-HIA,
an indicator of biotin deficiency, were given either a daily biotin
supplement or a fake pill every day for two weeks. By the end of the
study, the amount of 3-HIA in the urine of those taking the
supplement had dropped to normal levels. There was no change in those
who took the placebo pill.</TE>
<TE>   Could a lack of biotin cause birth defects? "There is no
conclusive evidence for this so far in human studies, but a similar
mild deficiency produces 100% incidence of cleft palate and limb
shortening in mice," says lead researcher Dr. Donald M. Mock, the
study's lead researcher and a professor at the University of Arkansas
for Medical Sciences. Still, much more research is needed before
supplements will be recommended to pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now There's Another Reason  to Eat Your Greens and Fruits</TE>
<TE>   In other nutrition research, a recent study appears to link a diet
low in leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, fortified bread and
cereal to Alzheimer's disease. Those foods are all excellent sources
of folate, and folate restricts the production of an amino acid in
the blood called homocysteine.</TE>
<TE>   Boston University researchers have shown for the first time that
as the amount of homocysteine in the blood increases in healthy
people, so does their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and
dementia.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine that
111 of the 1,092 men and women studied developed dementia or
Alzheimer's disease over an eight-year period. According to Dr. Sudha
Seshadri, a neurologist at Boston University, the people with the
highest levels of homocysteine had twice the risk of Alzheimer's
disease and nearly as high a risk for dementia. She said these
findings reinforce the need to eat folate-rich foods. Supplements are
not recommended yet, Seshadri said, but there are studies underway to
see if vitamin supplementation will decrease the risk.</TE>

<LD>Belated lessons learned: No. 1: If you haven't been cycling for a
while and you're carrying a few extra pounds like me, don't make your
first outing with a pro racer.</LD>
<LD>   No. 2: Pick someplace flatter than the San Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The idea was simple enough. I would ride with a professional
cyclist just to see how it compared with my own doddering pace,
perhaps getting a feel for the kind of exertion it takes to be a
top-flight rider. And maybe I'd even get a chance to ride one of
those fancy racing bikes as well.</LD>
<TE>   So I called my friend Cameron King, a mortgage banker by
profession, as well as a senior pro racer with the U.S. Cycling
Federation, and asked him to ride with me. King has been racing off
and on for the last 22 years. He retired from the sport when he
turned 40 but took it up again this year, at 45, because he missed
the competition. Sure, said King readily. Not only that, he'd supply
me with one of his racing bikes.</TE>
<TE>   I'm no stranger to cycling, having done it in at least moderately
serious fashion for the last 30 years. I've got a few dozen centuries
(100-mile rides) under my belt and have even done the grueling--the
name says it all--Hotter 'n' Hell Hundred in Wichita Falls, Texas, a
couple of times. But my regimen had lapsed during the time we lived
overseas (Israel and cycling don't mix), and I'd gotten on my aging
touring bike only a few times since returning to Los Angeles 18
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   I had noticed, though, that the streets around our Arcadia home
are filled with expert cyclists on weekends, not casual riders but
hundreds of hard-core bikers streaking through town. King is one of
them. All of them are doing what is called the Montrose Ride, which
begins at La Canada's Descanso Gardens every Saturday morning; moves
east, hugging the mountains, to the San Dimas area; then doubles back
to Sierra Madre. The complete circuit is 50 miles, and riders at the
front of the pack average 25 miles an hour for the run--in other
words, flying by my standards. That a ride of this caliber should be
taking place in Southern California is no surprise. One in six of the
26,912 professional riders in the U.S. lives in California, according
to the Cycling Federation, the sport's governing body. (As King
explained it, pros in this country are akin to minor leaguers
compared with those who ride the European circuit, where elite
cyclists make millions.)</TE>
<TE>   On the appointed morning, King picked me up in his SUV and we
headed toward Azusa. We weren't going to do the Montrose Ride, but
rather a 20-mile loop through the San Gabriel Mountains on a hilly
but reasonably easy (for him) route. At the Azusa Greens Country Club
he parked and quickly began assembling his bike and mine. The one
he'd picked for me was a sleek Bianchi titanium racing bike with
top-end components. He said it would retail for around $5,500, or
about $5,000 more than my own bike. My first thought was: What will I
do if I wreck it? Worry No. 2 came when I looked at the size of the
cassette, the set of gears on the rear tire. They were small, very
small, the kind used by expert racers to squeeze out even more speed,
but avoided by mere mortals because of the strength required to
pedal.</TE>
<TE>   We set off east on Sierra Madre Avenue for a five-mile run in the
flats before turning north onto Glendora Mountain Road. And it was
here that the pain began. The road climbed steeply, and I was soon in
the easiest gear, if you can call it that. King, ever patient, rode
at my side, though it was clear he was not used to climbing at such a
snailish speed. Three riders King often rode with overtook us.</TE>
<TE>   "How's it going?" King asked as they passed us.</TE>
<TE>   "Same old road," one of them replied.</TE>
<TE>   In a few moments they disappeared around a bend. King sped up to
stretch his legs, and I finally got off the bike, panting from the
exertion. When King returned we started climbing again, up the
winding road that soon left the basin behind. But again I had to
stop. And then again, near the top. We had been climbing about three
miles, and my heart rate monitor was registering above 190, compared
with the high end of my recommended zone, which is 142. King,
mercifully, decided it was time to go downhill for a change, so he
changed our route.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want you to die," he said.</TE>
<TE>   We turned the bikes around and began zipping down the hill. King
said the trick going downhill is to ride in as straight a line as
possible and not to hit the brakes. Me, I used them a lot, especially
around the hairpin turns. The rest of the 20-mile ride was in the
flats, and after two hours of riding we were back at the country
club. My heart rate was still above the maximum for my preferred
zone. In fact, I'd only been in my zone for a little more than five
minutes. The monitor said I'd burned more than 1,900 calories on the
run.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later I called Katie Safford, one of the top women
racers in the country and a Montrose Ride regular. What would she
recommend as a first step for those who want to take up cycling?</TE>
<TE>   "Get fitted correctly by a reputable bike shop and make friends
with the people in the shop because you'll be back in there a lot,"
she replied. (Spending a small fortune on bike and gear isn't
necessary, most pros say.)</TE>
<TE>   And what to avoid? Don't overdo it. "It's especially true with
women," she said. "They go out with their boyfriend or husband for
his favorite 45-mile ride. Then the bike gets hung up and never used
again."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, that sounded a lot like going for a ride with Cameron
King.</TE>

<HD>Recall of 2 Products Points Up Risks of Using Supplements</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans have grown increasingly fond of vitamin and herb
supplements, with about half saying they now take the products to
promote good health. But the $13-billion industry is not as tightly
regulated as the pharmaceutical industry, so consumers often can't be
sure precisely what they're getting. The recent government-ordered
withdrawal of two popular herbal products for contamination
highlighted the problems in the industry and may have unsettled many
who put their faith in the supplements.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Why were PC SPES and SPES pulled from the market?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: PC SPES, sold as a treatment for prostate cancer, and
SPES, touted as a general immune system enhancer, were withdrawn from
the market by the California Department of Health Services on Feb. 8.
State investigators had determined that the products were
contaminated with the prescription drugs Xanax, an anti-anxiety
medication, and Coumadin, a blood-thinner. Both products are made by
Bot- anicLab of Brea.</LD>
<TE>   The popular PC SPES, which studies have shown could help men with
a particular type of treatment-resistant prostate cancer, is a blend
of eight herbs including saw palmetto and Baikal skullcap. The
prescription drugs found in the product could cause severe side
effects, such as bleeding and allergic reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Could other products be contaminated?</TE>
<TE>   A: Dietary supplements are rarely removed from the market due to
contamination, but no one knows how often products might be impure.
The government doesn't regulate dietary supplements like it does food
and prescription drugs, and routine quality-assurance testing of
products would not necessarily reveal the presence of contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some high-profile cases of supplement
contamination, including the 1989 deaths of 37 people who took
L-tryptophan as a treatment for insomnia, depression and other
ailments. More recently, authorities have withdrawn some calcium
supplements made from natural sources, which may contain lead, and
some supplements possibly tainted with salmonella.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do products become contaminated?</TE>
<TE>   A: Contamination problems most likely occur when raw materials for
supplements are processed at factories with poor quality-control
practices. Many supplement manufacturers have quality-control
programs but would not be able to identify contaminants unless they
were actually looking for specific substances, says Forouz Ertl, of
U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nongovernmental agency that sets quality
standards for medicines. For example, health authorities would not
have detected Coumadin in the PC SPES product without testing it for
the presence of Coumadin. State officials began investigating the
product after learning of consumer complaints of adverse effects.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is the government doing anything to protect consumers from
contaminated supplements?</TE>
<TE>   A: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration monitors dietary
supplements for reports of adverse effects and has the authority to
remove unsafe products, which it has done in rare instances. The
government depends on manufacturers of dietary supplements to
self-police their industry to ensure product quality.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law does allow the FDA to establish mandatory good
manufacturing practices--or GMPs--for dietary supplements, but so far
it has not done so. In 1997, the FDA issued a proposal for the
standards and asked for public comment. The FDA is currently
reviewing comments to that notice. The rules are supposed to help
ensure the quality of raw materials used to make supplements, the
cleanliness and safety of manufacturing facilities and proper
testing, production and distribution practices.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why has it taken so long for the federal government to enact
protections?</TE>
<TE>   A: Enacting new rules is a complicated process that has been
prolonged by the change of administrations in Washington, says
Christine Lewis Taylor, director of the office of nutritional
products, labeling and dietary supplements for the FDA. "We're hoping
to have the rules sooner rather than later," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of mandatory government manufacturing practices charge
that the standards may impose an unnecessary and costly burden on
supplement manufacturers, particularly smaller companies. They say
the rules could force manufacturers to make their products a certain
way when there are better ways than those dictated by law. Standards,
opponents say, may make it hard for manufacturers to change their
products as new scientific knowledge or marketplace demands arise.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the meantime, how can consumers protect themselves?</TE>
<TE>   A: There are no assurances for consumers, says Mark Kantor, an
associate professor of nutrition and food science at the University
of Maryland. "Consumers need to accept the risk [of contamination]
given the past history of supplements and the fact that there are so
many manufacturers now," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers might be safer buying products made by large,
established companies. "The larger the company and the greater its
reputation, the more it has to lose," says Kantor. "Large companies
have the resources and wherewithal to do testing."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers can also look for quality approval seals from various
independent testing programs, such as ConsumerLab and Good
Housekeeping. However, the most extensive independent testing is
being offered by U.S. Pharmacopeia. Under a voluntary program, U.S.
Pharmacopeia will test dietary supplements for quality and safety.
Products that earn the "USP-verified" seal must contain ingredients
in the designated amounts, meet acceptable limits for undesired
materials and be manufactured properly.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ertl, USP also offers a "vendor specification
program" to supplement manufacturers. The program examines the
company's entire setup--from a review of its raw materials' vendors
to its own manufacturing facilities--to verify safety and quality.
"You have to start with a quality system in place to safeguard
against this situation" of product contamination, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are there other concerns about dietary supplements besides the
risk of contamination?</TE>
<TE>   A: Federal manufacturing guidelines would be "a major step
forward" in bringing credibility to the industry, Ertl says. But many
health experts doubt that supplements work--after all, few products
undergo rigorous scientific testing for efficacy. Others have
expressed fears that consumers will take supplements that interfere
with prescription drugs or will opt for supplements in place of
prescription drugs that have proven effective. Still others are
concerned about side effects of various herbs.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the most important issue is that dietary
supplements contain bioactive ingredients that have not been
adequately tested for safety and effectiveness," says Kantor.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies say these products have been used a long time and that
there is no reason to think they are unsafe. But there could be a
portion of the population who, because of their genetic variation,
may react in a way that we just don't know about.</TE>
<TE>   "How dietary supplements interact with food and drugs is another
issue," Kantor says. "You are just kind of out there with a lot of
unknowns."</TE>

<HD>Consider the Possible Problems With Ear Piercings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY DWASS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not that long ago, it was fairly common practice for kids to pierce
each other's ears with an ice cube and a needle, a practice that
could result in a nasty infection.</LD>
<LD>   These days, kids are better informed about ear piercing, knowing
that they can go to the doctor's office or jewelry store to have the
procedure done. It's generally considered a safer bet to go to a
doctor--usually a dermatologist.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble with getting your ears pierced at the jewelry store is
that you have no way of knowing for sure the expertise of the person
poking holes in you. Also, you can't be certain that the equipment is
properly sterilized.</LD>
<TE>   There are other things to keep in mind. If you're younger than 18,
you'll need a parent's permission. And it's a good idea to have a
discussion with them about whether piercing is the right choice for
you.</TE>
<TE>   "You should give it serious consideration. Piercing does leave
permanent marks on the skin," says Dr. Steven Weiss, chief of
dermatology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "It's important to think
about why one is doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Consider also that you will have to learn how to care for your
newly pierced ears to avoid complications. Make sure you understand
about cleaning your earlobes and how long to wear the studs. It's
important to always wash your hands before touching your pierced
ears. Swelling, redness, heat, tenderness, pain and oozing are signs
of a possible infection, requiring a visit to the doctor. Some people
have allergic reactions to different metals; real gold or stainless
steel are the recommended materials for earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "The other thing that I advise people is they shouldn't wear
anything that's too heavy or too long because this increases the risk
of stretching or tearing the earlobe," Weiss says.</TE>
<TE>   He discourages patients from piercing above the earlobe, in the
ear cartilage, because of the increased risk of problems. Piercing
other parts of the face also is risky business. Most dangerous of all
is tongue piercing, which sometimes can lead to chipped teeth, speech
impediments and even life-threatening swelling.</TE>
<TE>   "I would strongly, strongly discourage it," Weiss says.</TE>

<HD>Clinic Is a Lifeline for Uninsured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was speaking recently to a business executive in North Carolina who
was complaining about the rapidly rising cost of providing medical
benefits for his workers. "Nobody goes without health care in this
country," he said. "Somebody will provide it."</LD>
<LD>   Many others in this country hold a similar view, but having
reported on the problems of the uninsured for some years, I know that
the truth is much more complex.</LD>
<LD>   Recently I visited T.H.E. Clinic in Southwest Los Angeles, located
in a two-story building on Martin Luther King Boulevard. The clinic
is a place where the working poor without health insurance go for
care: nannies, gardeners, janitors, fast-food and factory workers.
The elderly come too. One 83-year-old shuffles in her walker for an
hour to travel a few blocks to the clinic.</LD>
<TE>   The clinic's executive director is Sylvia Drew Ivie, who started
her career as a civil rights lawyer and who understands the limits of
what community clinics can provide. The clinic's name, T.H.E., stands
for To Help Everyone, but the clinic has the capacity to assist only
10,000 patients a year in a neighborhood where roughly 250,000 people
lack health insurance. It is the only nonprofit health center in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "We do a lot, but we fail every day in terms of the quantity of
people served, the speed with which we can get specialty care and the
limited point of intervention in their lives," she says. "We need
another 10 clinics to take care of half the patients who need care."</TE>
<TE>   A visit to Ivie's clinic offers a glimpse of what uninsured people
go through to get health care: delays in getting treatment for
life-threatening illnesses, in obtaining medications and in gaining
access to the latest technology. Like most of the other nonprofit
community clinics in Los Angeles County, T.H.E. offers basic primary
care and lots of health education. Health-care professionals fan out
across the neighborhood urging women to come in for Pap smears and
encouraging people to be screened for diabetes. They warn of the
dangers of smoking and teach young people about sexually transmitted
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   If a clinic patient needs gallbladder surgery, there's little the
clinic can do except try to persuade a physician or hospital to see
the patient. "It's a barter system," Ivie explains. "We try to be
good collaborators with all the providers that might be beneficial to
our patients." The clinic opens its doors to students from big
teaching hospitals interested in doing research. In return, the
hospitals might provide specialty care. "If it's an interesting
case," she explains, "they are more inclined to say yes. If it's run
of the mill, they might say no."</TE>
<TE>   Obtaining referrals to specialists is a huge problem for the
county's uninsured, Ivie says. Her clinic sends many of its patients
who require specialty care to County-USC Medical Center, where the
backlog for appointments can stretch to several months or more. Other
primary-care clinics send thousands of patients there too. Ivie
thumbs through the medical file of a 52-year-old woman diagnosed with
breast cancer last August. She was unable to get a follow-up
appointment with a breast specialist until late January. Then there
is the 60-year-old man who was diagnosed by clinic doctors with
suspected lung cancer last October. By late January he still hadn't
been seen by a specialist. The paperwork for the referral is missing
at County-USC, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, T.H.E. Clinic made an urgent referral to USC for an
11-year-old boy who had drooping eyelids that made it hard for him to
see. His appointment is scheduled for this June, nearly a year after
he showed up and tried to get care. The family has no money, and the
clinic has no eye specialists.</TE>
<TE>   John Wallace, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services, attributes the appointment backlog to the "sheer
volume and chronic under-funding over many decades" for the county
health system. He notes that 2 million to 3 million people a year
receive outpatient care from county hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Getting prescription drugs for the clinic's patients is often a
catch-as-catch-can affair. Patients get medicines if the clinic has
them in stock. But cash flow problems sometimes make it difficult to
keep medicines on the shelf. If the patients are very poor, the
clinic tries to give them what they need at no charge. If they can
pay, they get prescriptions they can fill on their own.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ivie, patients usually appreciate the personal
attention they receive at the clinic. A Vietnamese American couple in
their late 50s had no medical care before they spotted an
advertisement in a Vietnamese-language newspaper that said the clinic
had a staff person who spoke their language.</TE>
<TE>   They've come several times, traveling from Orange County. Hiep Ton
works in a school cafeteria, and his wife, Thi-Nhung Dinh, was a
presser in a clothing factory before a work-related thumb injury
forced her to quit.</TE>
<TE>   She has high cholesterol and menopausal symptoms. He has high
blood pressure and a cough, which physician assistant Susan Brion
diagnosed as a side effect of his medication. Brion told him not to
take his friend's cough medicine and gave him his own prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Each time I visit clinics like Ivie's I'm struck by the haphazard
way they are financed and the lack of resources that this country
invests in caring for its neediest. The federal government spends
about $1.3 billion on some 3,000 community clinics nationwide. By
comparison, Congress gives the National Institutes of Health some $24
billion to develop new drugs and technologies that may never reach
those who come to the clinics. T.H.E. clinic receives $270,000 from
the federal government, much less than other clinics get. To get more
money, it would have to serve more people. To serve more people, it
needs more money.</TE>
<TE>   T.H.E. runs on an annual budget of $4 million, patched together
from 28 grants and funding sources, both public and private. The
money that does come in often depends on the funding organization's
special interest. The clinic may get a grant to do HIV education
among Thai American prostitutes and one to prevent smoking among
Vietnamese Americans, but it's a struggle to pay a medical director
to work full time. People who use the clinics are the stepchildren of
the health-care system, forgotten and invisible. They put up with a
standard of care largely unseen by most Americans fortunate enough to
have private health insurance.</TE>

<HD>Specific Brain Area Suspected of Muting, Magnifying Bad
Moods</HD>

<LD>A region of the brain a few inches behind the bridge of the nose may
hold the key to why some people have a negative outlook on life,
scientists announced last week.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, is the first to examine the neurological roots of what
scientists call "negative affect," a trait that predisposes people to
anxiety, irritability, anger and a range of other unpleasant moods.</LD>
<LD>   By suggesting that an unconscious disposition toward these
emotions may be molded by a specific area in the brain, the research
moves into previously uncharted waters. It is part of a broad effort
by neuroscientists to use powerful brain imaging technology to
pinpoint the areas of the brain responsible for various emotions.</LD>
<TE>   "It touches on an important issue: the relationship between
individual differences in personality and brain function," said
Marcus Raichle, a professor of radiology and neurology at Washington
University in St. Louis. "There have been for many, many years
attempts to explain the differences we observe among ourselves--[why]
we have different personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "If you believe behavior and brain are related, you would have to
suppose there are differences in brain systems that lead to
differences in personality," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the study, scientists at Vanderbilt University, the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota
asked 89 healthy people to take detailed tests that measured their
emotional outlook over the previous month. The tests were designed to
screen out people's mood states on the day they were evaluated and
look instead for a pattern of emotional attitudes--in other words, an
outlook or a temperament.</TE>
<TE>   While the subjects rested after the tests, the researchers
conducted brain scans that measured changes in blood flow within
their brains. The scientists found that increased brain activity in
one particular region--the ventromedial prefrontal cortex--was
associated with those who reported greater negative affect.</TE>
<TE>   Many factors besides physiology are responsible for personality,
and other parts of the brain are involved in emotions. But
researchers say the circumstantial evidence indicates that the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex acts as a sort of volume knob for
emotions. While the emotions may be produced elsewhere in the brain
in response to stimuli, this region of the brain can make them
deafening or muted.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some people may react sharply in a situation, while
others appear unruffled. The volume knob, in other words, may be what
people interpret as temperament.</TE>
<TE>   Most studies of brain activity have focused on trying to match
regions of the brain with particular moods or such abilities as
vision, language and physical movement. By focusing on an underlying
trait or a temperament in healthy people, scientists hope to
eventually understand why healthy people react so differently to the
same cues and why people with mental illnesses have extreme
responses.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, this could lead to better treatments of both psychiatric
medicines and psychological therapy. Current treatments for these
emotional disorders may in fact work by affecting these same brain
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's at least one component of the biology of temperament in
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex," said Jose Pardo, an associate
professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and one of the
researchers who conducted the study. "In a practical sense, what we
know is a person with higher activity in this area can be predicted
to have a high level of negative affect," he said. "High levels of
negative affect have been shown to have a high risk of depression and
anxiety. This may begin to tie aspects of temperament to disease."</TE>
<TE>   While negative affect may seem like the opposite of positive
affect, researchers do not find that people with diminished activity
in this part of the brain are "happier." Instead, patients with
damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have previously been
found to lack normal responses to emotional cues, according to the
paper.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see in people with brain lesions in this area is they
don't seem to be able to appreciate risk," said David Zald, an
assistant professor of psychology at Vanderbilt and the lead author
of the study.</TE>
<TE>   "They can tell you they are doing something that has a good chance
of failing, but they don't have the emotional reaction to it--they
don't have visceral arousal."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, "if you are betting a lot of money, you may
get a feeling in the pit of your stomach. They won't experience that;
they won't get as upset about it."</TE>
<TE>   The example serves notice to those who might want scientists to
find a way to shut off the brain region in order not to be bothered
with anxious or irritable thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "Anxiety is often helpful to us; it is protective,'' said Zald.
"If you don't have it, you're likely to not detect when you are in
danger or when you are taking too big a risk."</TE>

<LD>Question: Should I continue to exercise if I'm receiving chemotherapy
for breast cancer?</LD>
<LD>   JESSICA WOODHAM</LD>
<LD>   Merced</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Although you should check with your physician before
forging ahead with an exercise program, new research from Duke
University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., shows that women who
exercise moderately during breast cancer treatment suffer less
fatigue and weight gain than those who don't exercise.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, much "treatment-related" weight gain is due to a decrease
in activity rather than simply overeating or medication.</TE>
<TE>   Breast cancer patients often complain of medication-related muscle
loss, so one type of exercise to consider is strength training.</TE>
<TE>   I'd suggest focusing on lower body (large muscle group) exercises.
Walking can maintain your cardiovascular fitness without overexerting
or compromising your immune system.</TE>
<TE>   If you'd prefer to exercise in the privacy of your own home, you
could try "Alicethenics," an exercise tape created specifically for
women recovering from breast cancer surgery or treatment.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody can accuse Patrick Kronenwetter, a 47-year-old attorney in
Glen Ellyn, Ill., and a quadriplegic, of not having a sense of humor.
When asked about the events that led to his spinal cord injury and
subsequent re-entry into a world as a person with a disability, he's
likely to wisecrack, "Well, I guess you could say I kind of fell into
it."</LD>
<LD>   In 1989, while trimming a tree outside his home, Kronenwetter
slipped and fell from his ladder, landing on his head. During his
month in intensive care, he had no use of his legs and only limited
use of his upper extremities (the latter was later recovered).</LD>
<LD>   Kronenwetter now serves on the Spinal Cord Injury Assn. of
Illinois Board of Directors, participating in injury-prevention
programs and acting as an informal legislative liaison.</LD>
<TE>   Rayfie Burr was 26 when he was shot twice in the back of the head
and once in the chest while embroiled in a drug dispute on Chicago's
West Side. Doctors told him he would probably never walk again.</TE>
<TE>   Partially paralyzed ("My right side kind of sticks to me
sometimes," he said), Burr now uses a wheelchair about 75% of the
time. It is in this wheelchair that he participates in In My Shoes, a
violence-prevention and spinal-cord awareness initiative of Schwab
Rehabilitation Hospital, sharing his story with at-risk youth.</TE>
<TE>   Kronenwetter and Burr don't know each other. They were raised in
vastly different cultural backgrounds and live on opposite sides of
Chicago. But as men with spinal cord injuries, Kronenwetter and Burr
coexist in the same community, joined by men such as Christopher
Reeve, the actor injured in a fall from a horse; Jim Mullen, a former
Chicago police officer who was shot in the face in 1996 and is now
paralyzed from the neck down; Rob Komosa, a teenager who lost all
feeling and movement below his chin when three teammates tackled him
during a 1999 high school football scrimmage; and Travis Roy, the
Boston University hockey player who shattered his fourth cervical
vertebra during the first 11 seconds of his first college hockey game
in 1995, leaving him with no feeling below his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   About 250,000 Americans live with a spinal cord injury, according
to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center at the
University of Alabama. Of those, the vast majority--82%--are male,
and more than half are injured between the ages of 16 and 30. Most
incur their injury in one of four ways: vehicular accident (37%); an
act of violence (28%); a fall (21%); or a sporting activity (6%).</TE>
<TE>   Various theories exist as to the high proportion of males
affected. According to Mercedes Rauen, executive director of the
Spinal Cord Injury Assn. of Illinois, men may be at increased risk
for a spinal cord injury because of their involvement in particular
sports or in inherently riskier jobs such as construction work. Men
also tend to be greater risk-takers, she said. But regardless of the
gender of the individual with a spinal cord injury, Rauen said, it's
difficult to be prepared for such split-second devastation.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're going to die, but we're not programmed to think
about disability," she said. "This is not an illness. This is an
instantaneous change."</TE>
<TE>   The belief that the spinal cord is severed in all spinal cord
injuries is a common misperception, said Dr. David Chen, director of
the Spinal Cord Injury Program at the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago. Most often, the cord, protected by 33 bones extending from
head to tailbone, suffers a contusion, similar to a bruise on the
arm. When an individual falls, is shot or thrown from a car, the
energy is translated through the body to the spine. Should that force
prove too strong, Chen said, the bones in the spine can break,
squeezing the spinal cord and bruising the nerves. Resulting nerve
damage can rob individuals of sensation and render specific body
parts powerless.</TE>
<TE>   Rehabilitation can be as much psychological as it is physical. The
chaotic nature of the acute recovery phase, Chen said, can make
acclimation extremely challenging. It is in rehabilitation, he said,
where patients usually start to wonder aloud, "What does this mean
for my future, my ability to return to work, my family?"</TE>
<TE>   Kronenwetter said it was not until he had relearned the essential
functions of daily living--eating, bathing, dressing--that the
magnitude of his injury really sank in.</TE>
<TE>   "My first concern was whether I would be able to return to work
and support my wife," he remembered (he and his wife later adopted a
son, now 7). Then, in the midst of simultaneous courses of taxing
physical, occupational and psychological therapy, Kronenwetter
noticed himself following a prevalent pattern of initial denial.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many people, even most people, with a severe spinal cord
injury, you sort of say, 'OK, I'm going to overcome this, and in six
months I'll be fine,'" he said. But he later came "to the conclusion
that I could still lead a fulfilling life even if I didn't return to
my prior physical state."</TE>
<TE>   It is with this sort of pragmatic optimism that Kronenwetter said
his organization pursues spinal cord injury advocacy, peer support
and prevention. "Our organization is about not focusing on raising
money to find cures," he said. "What we really focus on is: Life must
go on. We are helping these people to get on with their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Burr has chosen to get on with his life by escaping the world of
gangs and drugs and becoming a peer speaker with In My Shoes. Most
often, children ask him, "Are you ever going to walk again?" "We let
them know there are no stupid questions," Burr said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kristin Vertiz, manager of extended services at
Schwab, In My Shoes was conceptualized in 1994 in response to a spike
in Chicago-area shootings--and consequent traumatic spinal cord and
brain injuries. Vertiz recruits individuals with such injuries and
trains them to lead presentations and workshops with high-risk
students.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids think they're going to end up dead or in jail, not that
they might be in a wheelchair for the rest of their life," Vertiz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab also invites students to the hospital for
disability-awareness workshops, in which they rotate through
wheelchair stations, have numbing agents put on their lips before
eating pureed foods, or are challenged to don distortion goggles and
tap a message into a communication board. Vertiz and colleagues hope
the impact of such activities will provide students with incentives
to steer clear of gangs and to treat people with spinal cord injuries
with respect. Preventively speaking, the Spinal Cord Injury Assn. of
Illinois sponsors the Think First program in schools, teaching safety
in diving, water sports, hockey, football, even proper use of seat
belts.</TE>
<TE>   The take-home pearl that the spinal cord injury community is eager
to disseminate: "There is a significant population of persons who
have been affected by a very serious event in their lives,"
Kronenwetter said, "but who are trying to function and prosper just
like everybody else. They may need some additional help, but they
really don't need or want any more pity."</TE>
<TE>   With men accounting for 82% of spinal cord injuries, that leaves
room for just a small number of women living with the disability.
Visits to even the most respected spinal cord injury Web sites yield
few, if any, links specifically for women, and those that do focus
primarily on issues of pregnancy. For example, a growing fetus can
place undue pressure on the lungs of a woman with a spinal cord
injury, decreasing her lung capacity and increasing her
susceptibility to pneumonia. The added weight of a baby also
complicates bladder and bowel function and can cause or worsen
pressure sores for a wheelchair-dependent woman.</TE>
<TE>   But sexuality is a monumental issue for women living with spinal
cord injuries. Margaret McDonnell, a 35-year-old administrative
assistant and quadriplegic who works at the Spinal Cord Injury Assn.
of Illinois in LaGrange, said a major task has been breaking down
preconceived notions about women in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   "You're no different than the person you were before the injury,"
McDonnell said, "but it's so difficult getting a man to see beyond
that wheelchair, to see you as a viable sexual being."</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell, who was injured at age 14 in a backyard diving
accident, said women with spinal cord injuries are few, most likely
because women tend to take fewer risks and to play fewer contact
sports. In terms of role models, "Christopher Reeve has been
marvelous, but you don't see many female advocates."</TE>

<HD>Reducing Risk of Heart Attacks Could Be Everyone's Cup of
Tea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA URSELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The British are known for their love of tea--the average Brit drinks
31/2 cups a day compared with a half-cup daily for Americans--but it
is U.S. scientists who are making the most strides in demonstrating
tea's potential to reduce the risk of heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   A study by U.S. researchers published last year in the American
Journal of Epidemiology found that people who consume three cups a
day could cut their heart attack risk by 11%. Several other studies
in the U.S. and elsewhere have also found a link between tea and
heart attack prevention.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists believe the beneficial effects of tea are probably due
to flavonoids, which are natural plant nutrients in tea. Like certain
vitamins and minerals in foods, these flavonoids act as antioxidants,
which are believed to limit the effect of "free radicals" in the body
and help fight heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   Laboratory work has shown flavonoids help to reduce inflammation
and lower the risk of blood clots forming; it is unclear exactly how
they produce such effects.</TE>
<TE>   Recent research by Dr. Joseph Vita, a professor at Boston
University's School of Medicine, has shed some light on how these
"supernutrients" might work on the linings of blood vessel walls, or
endothelium. The endothelium is known to control many aspects of
blood vessel activity, including whether the vessels are dilated to
allow for maximum blood flow, or are constricted, a condition that
can result in high blood pressure, a risk factor in heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Vita and colleagues examined the effect tea consumption had on the
damaged endothelium in 50 patients with heart disease. The patients
were measured once, two hours after drinking two cups of black tea,
and again after having four cups of black tea every day for four
weeks. The tests were then repeated using water instead of tea.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers were surprised to find that tea consumption helped
to restore normal function of the endothelium with a marked
improvement in dilation of blood vessels; water had no effect. "These
results provide an insight into why drinking tea might reduce
cardiovascular risk," Vita said.</TE>
<TE>   Another insight comes from work by Dr. Myron Gross, assistant
professor of nutrition and biochemistry at the University of
Minnesota, who looked at the effect that flavonoids in tea have on
the formation of blood clots. Cells in the blood called platelets
have a key role in clotting, providing the bulk of the substances
that stick to blood vessel walls and reduce or completely block blood
flow.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary tests by Gross and his team on healthy people indicate
that platelet buildup is reduced by drinking six cups of tea a day.
In a four-week study, participants were asked to avoid other foods
high in flavonoids, including onions, apples, fruit juices,
soybean-based products and aspirin.</TE>
<TE>   Gross found that tea drinking reduced platelet clumping by 15%.</TE>
<TE>   While the results are insufficient to warrant clinical claims
about the preventive benefits of tea in fighting heart disease, they
do support the idea that dietary intervention may play an important
role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. That's good news
because, for one thing, drinking more tea is relatively easy to do,
especially because iced tea is as good a source of flavonoids as the
hot tea and milkfavored by the British.</TE>

<HD>An Olympic Skating Controversy With Legs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the heated controversy that swirled around the selection of
Russia over Canada for the gold medal in the 2002 Olympics pairs
figure-skating competition.</LD>
<LD>   The real outrage, the question that lingers over the mountains of
Utah is, why won't they let the three-legged skater compete?</LD>
<LD>   I put that in italic letters not only to grab your attention but
to emphasize my concern over a slight that is bound to have
repercussions among activists in the community of those with ... well
... extra appendages. I was going to say those with handicaps, but
I'm not sure that having an extra leg is a handicap.</LD>
<TE>   As Desi Arnaz used to say, let me 'splain.</TE>
<TE>   I have been watching parts of the NBC coverage of the Olympics
with growing boredom. The giddy enthusiasm of the commentators is
almost more than I can bear, and the thrill of someone skidding down
a hill is, I'm afraid, lost on me.</TE>
<TE>   But it seems somehow un-American to just ignore the games
altogether in this time of national trauma. Rather than risk an
investigation by John Ashcroft, I spent hours watching young
snowboarders fling themselves about on the half-pipe for no obvious
purpose, and older men curling a device across a frozen surface in
what is arguably the most lackluster competitive sport ever created.</TE>
<TE>   I say that, realizing with a shudder that ballroom dancing may be
included in the next summer Olympics, God help us all, which would
push curling into second place. The motto "swifter, higher and
stronger" may soon include "smoother, sweeter and more rhythmic."
What next, competitive cosmetics? Speed eyeliner?</TE>
<TE>   I was in this frame of mind when, while shopping at a supermarket,
I saw a tabloid headline that proclaimed, "Salt Lake Shocker!
3-Legged Skater Banned!" At last, I said to myself, real controversy
in a carnival of ennui.</TE>
<TE>   The headline was in a newspaper, if I may use the term, called the
Weekly World News. I was drawn to it in the first place by an earlier
front-page feature that caught my attention while I was shopping for
beer and cat food. It claimed that Abraham Lincoln was a woman. Or,
utilizing WWN's terminology, Abe was a babe.</TE>
<TE>   I'll spare you details of the report, except to say that the
assertion is based on photographs, allegedly found in the basement of
the White House, that depict Lincoln in buttons and bows. John Wilkes
Booth, the man who assassinated the 16th president of the United
States, says the story, could have been her jilted lover.</TE>
<TE>   That was pretty interesting, all right, but the plight of the
three-legged skater is far more compelling, due to my continuing
concern over those deprived of their right to perform. I feel the
same about amateur stripping contests conducted in certain jock bars.</TE>
<TE>   According to a story written by one Michael Forsyth, the
three-legged skater is McKenzie Sarchent, 22, who lives in Salt Lake
City. There is a full-page photograph of her skating, with her arms
(two) flung into the air, and her legs (three) mastering the ice. The
bold-faced caption says, "She spins around on the ice like a
helicopter!" I'll bet.</TE>
<TE>   Forsyth quotes the girl's outraged father, one Jack Sarchent, as
saying McKenzie was banned from the Olympics figure-skating
competition this week by "skating officials" because the third leg
gives her an unfair advantage over skaters with two legs.</TE>
<TE>   Among other achievements, he says, McKenzie is able to perform a
quintuple axel, and can attain phenomenal speeds on the ice due to
her extra leg. "She uses it," the story says, "like an alligator
swishing its tail."</TE>
<TE>   WWN is published in Boca Raton, Fla. I twice attempted to contact
Michael Forsyth, who is listed in the staff box as the tabloid's
senior writer, but my calls were never returned. I wanted the phone
number of McKenzie or her daddy, since there was no listing of anyone
in Salt Lake with the last name of Sarchent. I felt that as a
professional courtesy, Forsyth might give me their number.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking contact with the story's author, I next telephoned the
U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee office in Utah and spoke with Jeff
Nimori in media relations. He said, "You want whaaat?"</TE>
<TE>   I said, "I want to know if you have any information regarding the
refusal of the Olympic committee to allow a woman with three legs to
skate in competition."</TE>
<TE>   My question was followed by such dead silence that I thought at
first our connection had been broken. I explained in more detail why
I was asking the question, and he said, "Does this have a tie-in with
the condom thing?"</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the brouhaha regarding the availability of
condoms in the Olympic Village for those athletes who engage in
sports not listed on the usual rosters.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I said, "it's just about a three-legged ice skater."</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled by my interest, he asked me to fax the story to him, which
I did. He ended our conversation by laughing slightly and saying that
the media office made it a policy not to comment on stories in the
newspaper, but promised someone would look into the situation. I
never heard from him.</TE>
<TE>   I might follow up on the piece someday, but for the time being I'm
concentrating on another intriguing story I found in the same issue
of the tabloid. It's about a model named Hannah L'Blanc. The headline
says, "Gal Strangled by Her Own Bra &amp; Panties." What a way to go.</TE>

<HD>The Big Boomerang Theory: Surfing an Endless Trend to Blend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINTON WEEKS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rufus II by Nike: Is it a walking shoe? A clog? A sports sneaker?
The no-heel, rubber-soled, slipperesque thing looks like all three.</LD>
<LD>   The palm-size Handspring Treo: Is it a cell phone? A video game
player? A personal digital assistant? A mini-computer? All of the
above?</LD>
<LD>   And the Pontiac Aztek: AutoWeek proclaims it "a minivan, SUV,
station wagon and motor home all rolled into one." So what is it?</LD>
<TE>   Time was you could tell a cookie from a candy bar, a spoon from a
fork, a restaurant from a playground, and a hot dog from a hen. Then
began the blending of America. Along came sofa beds, El Caminos and
the candy mint/breath mint that took the Cert out of certainty. Now
we're surfing along on an apparently endless blend trend, living in
the age of the Twix, the spork, the McDonald's PlayPlace and the
chicken frank.</TE>
<TE>   The blend trend is changing:</TE>
<TE>   * Vanity. At the MIT Media Lab, scientists are developing a
digital mirror that will help you monitor your heart rate and blood
sugar levels.</TE>
<TE>   * Banks. They used to be simply places to stash your cash. "Now
banks can sell any kind of product," says Tracey Mills of the
American Bankers Assn. "You can get auto insurance, mortgages,
brokerage services, life insurance--basically any financial services
product you need."</TE>
<TE>   * Churches. Once unprepossessing spots mostly for preaching and
praying, houses of worship today offer a smorgasbord of
opportunities: family life centers, fitness clubs, TV and recording
studios, radio stations and gift shops.</TE>
<TE>   * The military. Battle-minded blend trenders believe in the newly
developed Objective Individual Combat Weapon, a hybrid killing
machine that combines an assault rifle and a grenade launcher with
day and night sighting, laser targeting and a helmet-mounted display
screen that can receive video signals. You can watch "Apocalypse Now"
while you live through it. The strange-looking Bell Boeing V-22
Osprey marries the vertical takeoff, hover and vertical landing
qualities of a helicopter with the long-range, fuel efficiency and
speed of a turboprop aircraft, according to its designers. Is this
another shining example of fusion? Or confusion? More than 40 Marines
have been killed in Osprey crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Just look around. The Blizzard at the Dairy Queen blends ice cream
with candy. New Crest toothpaste with the Scope-mouthwash component
also whitens your teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting into the Swiss Army Knife market is Toollogic, with its
10-function Credit Card Companion--including tweezers, a compass, an
awl and a screwdriver--that's as flat as road kill. Your Monteverde
pen is a pencil, a highlighter and a PDA stylus. Your favorite
bookstore is also a coffee shop and music hall. Your cable TV
connection delivers movies and Internet access to your home.
Everything is becoming everything.</TE>
<TE>   Call it globalization, call it imperialism, but cultures, too, are
commingling at an accelerated pace. There's a Burger King in
Budapest. And Tex-Mex in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is there more blending than in the United States. We've
melted the melting pot and become a pureed people. We toss races and
ethnic backgrounds and ages and classes together into a combination
salad.</TE>
<TE>   We blend our words into neon neologisms--as recorded by
Logophilia.com--such as barkitecture (dog houses), tankini (a bikini
with a tank top), hasbian (a woman who was in a lesbian relationship
and now is with a heterosexual man) and Enronomics.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing new under the sun, so things are melting into one
another. We're trying to cram 10 pounds of living into a five-pound
life. We try to multi-task. As a result, devices meant to save labor
actually create work. We spend hours programming our Casio WQV3D-8, a
wrist camera watch that tells time, takes color pictures and
transfers them to our computer.</TE>
<TE>   The blended life is more complicated. We're all cross-dressed up
with nowhere to go.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps the world is getting simpler. Who needs a backpack full
of equipment when you've got Jeep's new 11-in-1 Survival Kit? In one
appliance, you'll find: a five-inch black-and-white TV, an AM/FM
weather band radio, a lantern, a fluorescent lamp, a flashlight, a
warning siren, a clock, a thermometer, a compass and audible mosquito
repellent.</TE>
<TE>   We're blending foods. Pass the tangelos. And the broccolini. And
energy-drink boosts that mix , herbs, vitamins and botanicals.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the universe has stopped expanding. The big bang is over
and the big boomerang has begun. Like an over-inflated balloon, the
firmament has gone about as far as it can go and is now beginning to
contract. Matter is collapsing in on itself, creating some very
strange compositions, such as the Afro Celt Sound System, a
six-member British band that combines Celtic harp lightness and West
African melodies with rhythmic Asian undercoatings in a London
clubbish mix-mash.</TE>
<TE>   Is that explanation too simple? Or too confusing?</TE>
<TE>   Or a mixture of the two?</TE>

<LD>ORDINARY LIFE</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Elizabeth Berg</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   198 pp., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the world of Elizabeth Berg's fiction, women like to talk, but
men generally don't. The women are eager to examine their lives and
relationships, to ask themselves if they're really happy. The men
don't want to go down this road, preferring to confine their
conversations to sports and politics. Sometimes it seems as if they
might all be happier if they lived in single-sex dormitories and got
together only for the purpose of mating.</TE>
<TE>   In the title story of Berg's latest collection, "Ordinary Life," a
79-year-old woman named Mavis locks herself in the bathroom. She's
lined the bathtub with pillows and laid in a supply of snack food and
magazines, plus a notebook and a pen. Her hapless husband, Al, fears
she wants out of their marriage, but he meekly acquiesces to what he
hopes is probably just a whim, bringing her food and clothing until
she condescends to rejoin him a few days later. How would she feel if
he did what she is doing? He demands at one point: "'I would just let
you do it,'" she replies, "'and I would talk to you when you wanted
to talk, and when you needed things I would bring them to you, and I
would not try to make you feel bad and guilty.' Silence. And in it,
his recognition that she is absolutely right."</TE>
<TE>   An all-too-typical moment in the fiction of Berg: The woman
condescends to the man, and, worse yet, the writer condescends to the
reader.</TE>
<TE>   Having taken her little bathtub "vacation," Mavis returns with a
deeper appreciation of the value of ordinary life. A similar pattern
of withdrawal and return can be found in the second story, "Departure
from Normal," about a woman with cancer. Berg's writing style, nicely
clear and simple at the best of times, in this instance borders on
the simplistic: "Alice likes to tell her story this way: First I got
cancer. Then I got depressed. Then I got divorced. Then my parakeet
got cancer. Then I really got depressed." Alice's husband, as we
discover, behaved wonderfully in the wake of her mastectomy: He was
loving, patient and caring. This made no difference to Alice, who
wanted to be alone. Fortunately for her, he seems ready to take her
back when she changes her mind.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Party," a group of women, none of whom has met one another
before, get involved in a juicy conversation about their first
experiences of sex. Soon, they're all laughing, convivial and
intimate. Across the room, one of the women sees her husband
discussing the Middle East with another man. "They didn't look as if
they were having much fun...." she observes.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is how I feel about men: I am angry at them for the way they
sling their advantage about--interrupting, forcing endings, taking
over. But I am sorry for them for the way they can never be like us.
And if the real truths ever got told, I think they would say they'd
like to be." Sometimes, the men get to have their say. A customarily
taciturn husband in another story, badgered by his wife to "Take This
Quiz," ends up expressing some feelings that might better have been
left unexpressed. In "Martin's Letter to Nan," the husband of the
heroine of Berg's 1996 novel, "The Pull of the Moon," tells his wife
how he feels about her decision to go off and find herself. Bluntly
expressing his exasperation--and his affection--Martin's missive is
funny, tender and truthful.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in several of these stories, the men and women do find
ways of reaching out to one another, learning to bridge the gap or,
at the very least, adjust to their temperamental differences. But not
all 15 pieces in this collection are about the gender gap. In
"Caretaking," a daughter tries to cope with her aging mother's
increasing infirmity, remembering, as she does so, her own childhood
when her mother did such a good job of caring for her. The narrator
of "What Stays" pays tribute to a mother who was mentally unbalanced
but still had many qualities that her daughter continues to cherish.
An adult daughter finally finds something to like about her sour,
grumpy father in "One Time at Christmas, in My Sister's Bathroom"
(Berg does seem to have a special affinity for rooms with porcelain
and plumbing).</TE>
<TE>   Yet, while "What Stays" and "Caretaking" have real poignancy, "One
Time at Christmas, in My Sister's Bathroom" is more of a sentimental
set-piece. And there's a similarly prefabricated feel to the two
closing stories, "The Thief" and "Today's Special," the one an
unlikely tale about a housewife's encounter with an improbably
insightful burglar; the other a rather forced celebration of the
quotidian world as showcased in a diner. But despite her occasional
lapses into mere coyness, Berg's more deftly drawn pictures of
ordinary life can help remind us of its oft-unheeded charms.</TE>

<HD>In the Wonderland of Libraries Are Cats Like Alis</HD>
<DH>Carrying on feline tradition, the Silverado calico found a
home in a reading room.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were quiet moments in the Silverado Branch Library when the
world seemed still, and words moved silently from the page, like
sunlight through a window, and the only sound was the faint purr of a
calico cat. Her name was Alis.</LD>
<LD>   Little is known about her life before she arrived at the tiny
library, located at the base of the Santa Ana Mountains in Orange
County. She came to Silverado Canyon as a kitten in 1985, on a day
when branch librarian Lucille Cruz was waiting--and waiting--for the
newly created Automated Library Information System (ALIS) to recover
from a crash.</LD>
<LD>   As they waited, Cruz decided to send an assistant, who had been
lobbying for a library cat, to a shelter in search of prospects. The
assistant returned with the calico, and to reflect their hope that
both cat and computer would work out, they assigned them the same
name.</LD>
<TE>   There are many cats, like Alis, living in libraries, stretched
across warm computer terminals like vamps on gleaming pianos, or
snuggled between volumes by Steinbeck and Stegner. There is a Web
site, a documentary and even an organization, the Library Cat
Society, based in Moorhead, Minn., that produces a newsletter to a
nationwide membership.</TE>
<TE>   It's not always smooth going, depending on the demeanors of cats
and customers, but from the moment Alis arrived at the Silverado
Canyon library, patrons welcomed her. They visited even when they had
no literary needs. When they moved away, they sent her cards, and she
wrote back, a paw-shaped stamp serving as her signature. Friends
brought tasty treats on special occasions, played with her, listened
for her soothing purr on still days. Young people in the canyon grew
up with Alis, listened to glorious tales with her during the story
hours of their childhoods. She made the library feel like home, says
Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Even Carmen Franklin, a local woman whose affections included spy
thrillers and historic romance but not cats, eventually came around
to accepting Alis, who would hop up on the counter and rub against
her, as if to say, "How could you not love me?"</TE>
<TE>   Eventually Carmen, albeit with some hesitation, reached out,
petted Alis a bit awkwardly and acknowledged, "I guess she's all
right for a cat."</TE>
<TE>   Both are gone--Carmen, who died in December, and Alis, who died
last month--but even now, says Cruz, lifting her eyes and smiling,
"Alis is probably up there buggin' her."</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Alis was a friendly and courageous cat.</TE>
<TE>   She stood her ground against the occasional rodent, reptile or dog
intruding upon her domain, but when it came to people, especially the
elderly, she extended warm invitation, leaning against ankles in
gentle pursuit of soft strokes.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 15 years of library life, Alis died of a stroke on
one of the last days of January. She was buried next to a dog named
Bear beneath a sapling oak and purple sage.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between cats and libraries goes back centuries,
says Phyllis Lahti, founder and director of the Library Cat Society.
It was likely the result of another, less accepted relationship, that
of libraries and mice.</TE>
<TE>   The society has a threefold mission: "To encourage the
establishment of a cat or cats in a library environment; to improve
the well-being and image of the library cat; and to promote
camaraderie among library staffs who have cats, or hope to, and with
those persons not in libraries who advocate library cats."</TE>
<TE>   "They're especially attractive to older people who visit
libraries, and they're amenable to petting," says Lahti. "Books, cats
and libraries go together."</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Richard Espinosa of San Marcos, would disagree.
Espinosa has filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against the Escondido
Public Library. In it, he claims a cat named L.C. (Library Cat)
attacked his assistance dog, Kimba, who he says is trained to help
him deal with, among other things, anxiety attacks.</TE>
<TE>   L.C. has been given a change of venue and now stays with a library
employee pending a resolution of the case.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other lawsuits filed on behalf of those who fear
cats or are allergic to them and oppose their presence in public
places. It has become an emotional issue at some libraries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, filmmaker-comedian Gary Roma of Boston produced a
documentary about library cats titled "Puss in Books: Adventures of
the Library Cat." It was a departure from his previous work, an
examination of doorstops.</TE>
<TE>   While researching the film, Roma heard about a cat named Muffin,
who was removed from a library in Putnam Valley, N.Y., when a library
trustee developed an allergy to cats. Upon the cat's eviction, two
members of the community became so upset they removed the library
from their wills. It was an $80,000 loss in future revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Roma has developed a Web site about library cats at
www.ironfrog.com that includes a map listing almost 400 current and
past library cats.</TE>
<TE>   In Spencer, Iowa, population 11,300, public library director Vicki
Myron says the most famous being to ever call Spencer home might be a
cat named Dewey Readmore Books, who has appeared on radio and
television as well as in magazines and newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   His story began one morning in the cold of winter. On Jan. 18,
1988, Myron and an assistant heard a tiny sound coming from the
library's drop box, and there, buried beneath volumes of returned
books, was a kitten.</TE>
<TE>   "He was half-dead, and his foot pads were frozen," says Myron. "We
gave him a bath to warm him up and found out he adored people. He
wasn't afraid of strangers, so we decided to keep him."</TE>
<TE>   He has reached such celebrity status that his picture appears on
Spencer's library cards, and now there are even Dewey postcards,
which have been requested from as far away as South Africa, Belgium
and Holland. Sales of the cards have generated up to $100 a month for
the library.</TE>
<TE>   "He pretty much pays his own way," says Myron.</TE>
<TE>   Dewey climbs ladders, rides on book carts, sleeps in boxes. In the
early morning, he stands and raises a paw against a window as if to
wave hello to Myron as she approaches the building.</TE>
<TE>   When those who are uncomfortable around cats use the library,
Dewey waits it out in Myron's office.</TE>
<TE>   He's very sociable, sitting in on meetings in the conference room,
greeting people at the front door and moving from lap to lap. There
are a couple of exceptions. If Dewey hears the words "brush" or
"bath," he runs and hides. If he sees James Esterly, the local
veterinarian, entering the library, he similarly makes a break for
it.</TE>
<TE>   He is especially kind to children with special needs, Myron says.
He seems to understand them. "There's one little girl who can't speak
and rarely smiles, but when she sees Dewey, she absolutely beams."</TE>
<TE>   Dewey is not inclined to pursue mice, and no such expectations are
placed upon him. "If a mouse ever came in here," Myron says, "Dewey
wouldn't know what to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Dewey, Alis' fame was limited to her small world. In
Silverado Canyon, pets are known by name and reputation. The most
visible are the dogs, among them Kelsey and Bailey, who hang out at
the Silverado Canyon Market next to the library. Bailey's brother,
Buddy, hangs out at the Shady Brook Market, located up the canyon a
bit. Then there's Megs, Jake and Jesse. Odie now lives in Florida,
Shelby doesn't get out much anymore.</TE>
<TE>   There was a dog named Lacey, best known for her ability to smile
on command. Whenever a book ordered by Lacey's owner would arrive at
the library, Cruz would write a note, fasten it to Lacey's collar,
and thus provide notification.</TE>
<TE>   There used to be a couple of ne'er-do-wells, pit bulls, who one
Saturday in 1998 sneaked around to the back of the library and came
in through the backdoor. Cruz heard a commotion and found the dogs
savaging Alis. Cruz ran out front to get help. A man came in and
fought the dogs off with his fists.</TE>
<TE>   Alis was rushed to a clinic, where she underwent surgery. A
portion of her intestines was removed. She also suffered a broken
breastbone and numerous lacerations.</TE>
<TE>   Folks from the canyon went in shifts to sit with Alis as she
recovered. Judi Davis, owner of the Silverado Canyon Market, set out
the Yuban coffee can she uses for donations whenever a local animal
gets run over or otherwise requires medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   Current and past library patrons and employees sent money with
their get-well cards. In all, checks, bills and loose change totaled
about $1,400, enough for the veterinary clinic to call it even.</TE>
<TE>   Some people say Alis was never the same after the attack. She used
to love to go out behind the library next to the creek and lie in the
morning sun, but these last few years, she wouldn't go outside unless
someone went with her, Cruz says. She became less patient with young
children, had difficulty reaching the top shelves.</TE>
<TE>   There were two services when Alis died. Davis at the market
planted a peach tree behind the store in Alis' memory. It has been
difficult, says Cruz, who has worked at the library since 1979, to
open the door and have no one there to welcome her. During quiet
moments now, when no one is around, there is only silence, and it
feels a bit empty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early," says Cruz at the prospect of another cat. "We
don't want people dropping off cats at our frontdoor. When the time
is right and the right cat comes along, maybe then, but not now."</TE>

<DH>Saddle up for a freestyle and dressage competition in
Burbank, where the riders and horses will move as choreographed
teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH KAYE McCALL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 6:30 in the morning as Masterpiece starts his day with the first
course of breakfast--timothy hay. At 7, his grain arrives, complete
with an athlete's ration of high-tech vitamin and mineral
supplements. Then, after relaxing in his 12-by-24-foot stall at the
privately owned Epona Farms in Thousand Oaks, the Danish Warmblood
horse goes for a half-hour morning "hand-walk," in which the groom
leads him on foot. It's all part of the finely tuned training ritual
for the dark bay Grand Prix dressage horse.</LD>
<LD>   At 11 a.m., with his back warmed by a heat lamp before the saddle
is secured, 5-foot rider and trainer Leonie "Button" Baker of
Thousand Oaks will climb aboard Masterpiece's towering frame (17.2
hands at the withers, or about 5 feet, 7 inches) to hone their skills
for the first United States Freestyle Competition and the Dressage
World Cup U.S. League Finals on Saturday and Sunday at the Los
Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Masterpiece will go on to his midday lunch, then have an afternoon
hand-walk, perhaps another ride from Scottish-born Baker, and an
early-bird dinner at 4 p.m. The day-sheet covering his gleaming coat
will be swapped for a heavier night blanket, before he gets another
round of hay at 8 p.m. On any given day, he may also have a visit
from the chiropractor, equine masseuse, or farrier before calling it
a night.</LD>
<TE>   "It takes a team to keep up the horse. It's not just the trainer,"
says Baker, who has ridden Masterpiece for three years. Although he
can be like "riding a pistol" in the show ring, she says, "he's got
tremendous heart."</TE>
<TE>   Come Tuesday, he will be joining the morning commute along the 134
Freeway in the comfort of a lush horse van, ready to settle in at the
equestrian center and await the other equine elite who qualified to
compete. Showcasing the country's top dressage riders, including two
Southern California Olympic bronze medalists, Guenter Seidel and
Steffen Peters, the competition is the horse world's version of
Olympic-level figure skating, with individually choreographed rides
set to music and scored on technical and artistic merits.</TE>
<TE>   The event this weekend will be the qualifier to select the single
rider who will represent the United States at the FEI Dressage World
Cup Final in the Netherlands in March, which also includes musical
freestyle. As in figure skating, certain required movements must be
executed duringthe musical program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely the most beautiful thing to watch and see these
horses go with the music," says Baker, 54, who once aspired to become
a ballerina and does all her own freestyle music choreography. "You
have to take the horse's character into consideration when you're
choosing the music and things like the way he moves. I actually
create the ride first."</TE>
<TE>   After testing how well music selections match her mount's gaits,
Baker has a music mixer who uses videotape and a computer to complete
the audio component of the ride. The music's speed, beat and rhythm
are synchronized to movements as varied as pirouettes, piaffe (trot
in place), and lead changes so quick, the horse appears to skip.</TE>
<TE>   "I often find unusual music," Baker says, although she is mum
about the actual songs in Masterpiece's upcoming freestyle. "I kind
of like to keep that a secret.... Everybody has their different way."</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Olympic bronze medalist Seidel of Rancho Santa Fe sees
the Grand Prix dressage freestyles as more exacting than figure
skating. "Watch the beat of the gait to see if it fits the music,"
says the German-born Seidel, 41. "I'm almost surprised how little
[skaters] have the music fit what they're doing. It's more background
music. For us, the goal is to have the music really support the beat
of the gait."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Zang, who is based in Maryland, is one of the five
Federation Equestre Internationale approved judges who will score the
competition. Three others have flown in from Australia, England and
Germany. The fifth is from the United States. Zang offers some
pointers for those new to the sport. "There are five judges and we
judge the technical and the artistic side just like any other Olympic
sport in the freestyle. As a judge, you look for the technical aspect
of each movement," she says. "The artistic depends on the harmony of
the horse and rider, the horse's gaits, and then the choreography
[which includes the degree of difficulty of their moves] and the
music they select for the horse."</TE>
<TE>   Even the uninitiated can quickly distinguish an important element.
"One thing you can watch is [whether] the beat of the music goes
along with the beat of the horse's front legs," says Zang. However,
unlike figure skating, the Grand Prix dressage (freestyle or other)
is strictly formal attire. Riders wear white britches, shirts and
gloves, plus a black coat with tails and a top hat.</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the dressage community, Zang envisions freestyles
achieving a wide fan base, much like figure skating. "We only had
technical [competitions at first] and not many people could relate."
Then the Olympic committee urged putting freestyles into the sport.
"For us, it's the avenue where people can come watch, enjoy a sport
that a lot of people haven't been able to understand and hopefully,
we'll get more interest and sponsorship."</TE>
<TE>   Baker is enjoying the United States Freestyle Championship before
even arriving in Burbank. "It's the first time it's ever been held
and they're going to swap it from coast to coast each year. We were
lucky enough to get it on our coast the first year." On top of that,
Masterpiece, still a relative newcomer at the Grand Prix level,
qualified for the competition. "I'm just proud of having made the cut
in his first season. Anything else is like icing on the cake."</TE>

<DH>A young woman's true story from the 14th century inspires a
young woman in the 21st. The result is a first novel with a heady
plot steeped in medieval realities of the Inquisition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did she know it was a sin to sleep with the village priest? And
another sin, adultery, to sleep with him while she was married? And a
third sin, incest, because he was her blood relation?</LD>
<LD>   No, the young woman told the Inquisitor, a bishop.</LD>
<LD>   "I did not think I was sinning. It gave us both great joy.... Our
joy was shared," she said naively, as if the mutuality would absolve
them.</LD>
<TE>   This snippet of real dialogue from the Inquisition of 1320 came
hurtling through time like a Hail Mary pass--to be caught by
Charmaine Craig of Santa Monica. She was an aspiring actress and a
Harvard undergraduate in 1991, when she discovered the true story of
the woman and the priest, the rural mountain village where they
lived, and the roving band of heretics called the Good Men, who
sought to convert them from Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   What could 14th century life have been like for this young wife
and mother, named Grazida Lizier? And for the sex-obsessed priest,
Pierre Clergue, who lusted after three generations of her family's
women? And who could possibly care?</TE>
<TE>   Even if you know nothing of medieval times beyond the theme
restaurant of that name, you may be intrigued by Craig's stunning
first novel. "The Good Men: A Novel of Heresy" (Riverhead Books) is
redolent with time and place: soggy dung floors beneath bare feet,
wind whistling through walls and pane-less windows. Surgery with no
anesthesia, except wine. Chamber pots instead of plumbing,
zipper-less pants, the magic of fire--the only source of light and
heat.</TE>
<TE>   It is an absorbing tale, and a short course on rural life in the
Middle Ages--a subject few have the luxury or desire to spend much
time on. But there is some relevance for the millennium. Just turn
off your PC, lean back and regress a few hundred years to Montaillou,
France, where life revolves around the little church whose priest
cannot keep his pants on. This was not so unusual for the era, Craig
learned in her research. Rural priests often had concubines who lived
with them, had affairs with married women, did all sorts of unholy
things--like appropriating tithes from parishioners for the priests'
personal uses. In the case of Clergue, all the above applied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good Men Posed Threat to the Catholic Church</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was peace in the village until the Cathars, or Good
Men, appeared. They preached that heaven was God's domain, Earth was
the realm of Satan, and all earthly pleasure must be denied. They
said men must stop eating anything that pleases the palate, must stop
touching their wives. Even a pat on the hand was forbidden, let alone
more intimate contact. They believed humans must enter heaven in
order to know true pleasure--and so they couldn't wait to die. They
were not so different, in that respect, from the zealots of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic church, which ruled the region, was understandably
appalled. It saw the potential of mass self-imposed starvation, a
plummeting birthrate, and many lost human souls if the Good Men took
hold. And so the Inquisition came to town, with its own brand of
extremism, including torture racks and burnings at the stake. This
was not a particularly good time in which to live.</TE>
<TE>   Craig, 30, on the other hand, grew up in the sunny sophistication
of Santa Monica, blessed with interesting parents and an abundance of
assets. She was a smart, pretty child, and by her admission, a pious
one. In her Protestant, church-going family, she was the only one of
three siblings who was deeply attracted to spiritual concerns, to
questions of good and evil, she says.</TE>
<TE>   She has no idea why, but she also "focused more than the others on
learning about Christ and trying to be Christ-like and pure." And she
was "overly thoughtful" about issues of how to comport herself. Her
parents were pretty easygoing about all this, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they thought it was a passing phase, because Craig was
equally determined, as a child, to become a great actress. She begged
for acting lessons after school and on weekends--and they obliged. By
the time she was a teenager, at the Marlborough School for girls in
Los Angeles, Craig recalls being "filled with questions of spirit
versus flesh, and frequently subject to great feelings of shame." She
says she often sought moral guidance from elders on issues that most
young people her age were able to sift out for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In the English honors program at Harvard, she majored in medieval
literature, which is when she came across the deposition of Grazida
Lizier, the woman who'd loved the priest. "I felt as if a real soul
was floating up from the pages, I could almost hear a real voice
speaking the words."</TE>
<TE>   Originally inscribed in pen on parchment in 1320, Grazida's words
had not only survived and lodged in Craig's consciousness; they
imprinted themselves and echoed there. She thinks that's because
Grazida was so confident about the choices she'd made in life. "Even
with Inquisitors telling her she should be ashamed of her love for
the priest, that what she did was wrong and sinful--she did not,
could not, think of it that way. Her free spirit and independence
seemed so modern and admirable to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a More Fulfilling Career</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of Craig's studies, Hollywood called. A casting
director she'd met years before gave her the lead in Disney's 1994
film, "White Fang II." She spent the summer before her senior year
making the movie, and was advised by her agent to stay in Hollywood
and "ride the wave." Craig rejected the advice, returned to school,
and after graduation came back to seek more work. She soon won the TV
role of Ed Chigliak's girlfriend on "Northern Exposure"--and says she
got a look at what life would be like if she pursued an acting
career. Unsatisfying.</TE>
<TE>   It was tough going out for roles, she says, because of "my ethnic
mix." Her father is a blue-eyed blond of English, Scottish and French
descent. Her mother, twice named Miss Burma, and a former film
actress herself, is half-Karen (which is the largest ethnic minority
in Burma), and half-Sephardic Jew. Craig says that for Asian roles,
she was frequently told she didn't look Asian enough. For European
roles, she often heard she looked too Asian.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't just about race, she says. In Hollywood, she was
always worried about "whether I was thin enough, whether I wore sexy
enough clothes. It just wasn't me. I am too cerebral. And too shy."
She increasingly wanted to find something "more intellectual and
creative" to fulfill her life. So she enrolled in writing courses at
UCLA's extension school in her spare time. She soon amassed a
portfolio of short stories and a group of encouraging teachers, who
urged her to apply to graduate school. The perfectionist in her
surfaced again. She applied to the one place she knew was "almost
impossible" to get into. The graduate program in fiction writing at
UC Irvine accepts six students from about 300 applicants each year.
Craig was one of three women accepted in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   That's when her preoccupation with Grazida's deposition
re-surfaced, and became the starting point for a fictionalized
account of her life and the lives of those in Montaillou.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of research and writing in the UCI program, and
two trips to Montaillou, high in the Pyrenees mountains, Craig threw
out her first draft and spent two more years rewriting the book "in
one long exhale, from start to finish."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Spiegel, a founder and editorial director at Riverhead, says
she almost didn't look at the book. "I hate historical novels. I'd
have turned it down cold, but the agent's pitch was unusually
enthusiastic." After reading the manuscript, she says she "pre-empted
the book." This means she offered "an amount so high that the agent
would take it off the bidding table and give it right to us. I just
felt it was fresh and current. And after Sept. 11, the book's view of
fanaticism is even more relevant."</TE>
<TE>   "The Good Men" has received unusual critical notice for a first
novel. Time magazine's review calls Craig and her book "the real
deal" and said her "prose blends mysteries both religious and erotic
with the scratchy, stinky realities of peasant life." Newsday calls
it "an intriguing work of historical fiction." The Sunday New York
Times Book Review called it "ambitious" and "deft." Craig's
publishers sent her on a 15-city promotional tour, an unusual
expenditure for first novelists these days. And it has been sold for

<TE>   Morality, Sexuality and  Tension Between the Two</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in her whitewashed, one-room cottage in Laguna Beach
recently, Craig wears jeans, a print blouse, long hair and no makeup.
She is liberated now from those early concerns, a free spirit at
last, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that came from the gradual process of growing up, she
says. Part came from her studies, through which she realized that
since time began, humans have faced issues of morality versus
sexuality--and a tension between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, much of what she wrote about 14th century human
relations and behavior hasn't changed all that much to this day.</TE>
<TE>   She also learned about herself. "In a nutshell, I guess I'd say I
... may I read something to you?" she asks. "It sums up exactly what
I think." She opens an essay by George Orwell: "The essence of being
human is that one does not seek perfection ... that one is prepared
in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the
inevitable price of fastening one's love upon another human
individual. Sainthood is a thing human beings must avoid. Most people
genuinely do not wish to be saints. And it is probable that those who
aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human
beings."</TE>
<TE>   She pauses. "The reason this resonated so much with me is that I
was always trying to be so good, that I wasn't free to ... " She
stops short. She probably shouldn't reveal these innermost thoughts
in the local paper, she says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, she says, she's finally learned things that others seemed to
know automatically, but that she used to question. That the messiness
of life, and all the imperfections of relationships--it's all
worthwhile if it's for the sake of love. One of three men accepted in
the Irvine graduate fiction program the same year as Craig, Andrew
Winer, has asked her to marry him. She said yes.</TE>

<LD>Purim, the annual Jewish holiday that celebrates the ancient tale of
Queen Esther of Persia, begins on the evening of Feb. 25. As told in
the biblical story from the Book of Esther, Queen Esther and her
Uncle Mordechai uncovered a plot by the king's chief advisor, Haman,
to destroy the Jews of Persia more than 2,000 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The celebration of Purim is a lot of fun. First and foremost, one
must read (or listen to) the Megillah, which tells the story of Queen
Esther. Whenever the name of the evil Haman is read, children and
adults boo and hiss, stomp their feet and shake special noisemakers
called groggers to drown out his name. It's also a day to dress up in
costumes, have parades, eat special foods including a cookie called a
hamentashen (a three-cornered, filled pastry), collect money to help
those less fortunate and give gifts to family and friends. These
gifts, called mish- lo'ach manot, are often baskets of fruits,
candies and other good things to eat.</LD>
<LD>   You can make mishlo'ach manot at home. Using an empty strawberry
basket or other container, decorate the outside by weaving colored
yarn or ribbon through the holes in the basket. Make a handle by
twisting or braiding pieces of wire pipe cleaner together and then
fill the basket with goodies for your friends.</LD>
<TE>   Kids ages 5 and up can learn more about Purim through stories,
songs and art at Skirball this Sunday at 2 p.m. Family educator Julie
Jaslow Auerbach will also read "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible,
No Good, Very Bad Day."</TE>
<TE>   For reservations, call (310) 440-4636. For general information,
call (310) 440-4500 or visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<LD>In Praise of Lincoln</LD>
<LD>   "In Their Own Words: Abraham Lincoln"</LD>
<LD>   by George Sullivan</LD>
<TE>   Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) was one of the truly great men of all
time. He preserved the Union during the Civil War and proved to the
world that democracy can be a lasting form of government.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States. The American
people knew little about him when he became president. He was the
first president elected representing the Republican Party. Lincoln's
great asset was his ability to express his convictions clearly and
with such force that millions of his countrymen made them their own.
Lincoln's source of strength was his iron will.</TE>

<TE>   "The Shakespeare Stealer"</TE>
<TE>   by Gary L. Blackwood</TE>
<TE>   In the 1600s in England, an orphan named Widge was adopted by a
man named Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright taught Widge a shorthand method and
sent him to churches to steal sermons.</TE>
<TE>   One night he was kidnapped and taken to a mysterious man's house.
He was asked to use Dr. Bright's shorthand to steal the lines of
Hamlet at the Globe Theatre. Widge made friends and did not want to
steal the lines.</TE>
<TE>   The book shows you what it was like to live back then. There is
sword fighting, chasing, and a girl pretends to be a boy in order to
act onstage.</TE>

<LD>The clock struck midnight, but Molly was still awake, remembering the
mistakes she'd made skating at the rink that day. There were only two
weeks left until the Skate Club Ice Show, but she was still clumsy
when she tried to do the double axel. She could jump from one skate
into a turn, but she couldn't complete two turns without falling.
With homework and all the other things she had to do, she hadn't
practiced enough.</LD>
<LD>   She wished she could go to the pond right now and practice. She
wasn't supposed to go there at night, but her parents were asleep and
she was sure they would understand if they knew how worried she was.
She pulled on her warm pants and a sweater, then found her gloves and
jacket in the bedroom closet, put on her boots, and went outside,
carrying her skate bag.</LD>
<LD>   A full moon glittered on the snowy fields, giving the night a
silver brilliance so that Molly could see her way through the trees
and down the lane. Their house was just outside the city, and in
winter Dad smoothed the ice on the pond in the woods so she could
skate there. Now it shimmered like a crystal mirror, beautiful but
strange at night.</LD>
<TE>   Molly sat on the wooden bench at its edge as she put on her
skates. Dad had made the bench, but Molly had helped, sawing some of
the boards and hammering nails. She remembered what Dad said when she
complained it was hard work.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard work is good for you. It helps you grow."</TE>
<TE>   Molly laced her skates then took off her jacket, leaving it on the
bench, and glided out to the center of the pond. She'd practice that
double axel until she got it right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Molly be able to get it right?</TE>
<TE>   Gail Kimberly lived in Ottawa, Canada, where she learned to skate.
But she never could do the double axel. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to be well-informed, we each follow the flood of news rushing
at us every day. In the privacy of our minds we cheer and jeer, we
marvel and lament at the grandiose and pathetic panoply of human
doings unfolding before us. Then we go about our own business. Every
once in a while, though, some little thing--in this case a very
little thing--makes us pause to ponder publicly.</LD>
<LD>   Such was the contents of a battered department store shopping bag
found by a curious nurse the other day in a Canoga Park hospital
parking lot. It was a seven-pound newborn boy. The nameless fellow
had spent most of his first day whimpering there--nobody cooing, no
one taking photos, no one vying to hold him next. He would have died
there within hours. He's now eating heartily, however, surrounded by
cozy blankets and attentive teddy bears, oblivious to the lengthening
line of adults earnestly seeking to take him into their lives. A
discarded shopping receipt, also in the bag, led police to arrest a
26-year-old mother.</LD>
<TE>   We're unprepared to let this go right now. Let's be honest: It's
difficult to fathom a mind, even a desperate, frightened one, that
could contemplate and execute such a likely lethal act against
someone so utterly helpless. It happens hundreds of times a year in
our country, at least two dozen times in California. Last month a
Monrovia teenager dropped her newborn into a dumpster. He was found
and will survive. No one knows those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   Society has done much to prevent these tragic abandonments.
Thirty-five states have safe haven laws, allowing delivery of
newborns (and surrender of parental rights) at hospitals with, in
effect, no questions asked. Many states like California, however,
have yet to invest in getting the word out. Public and private
agencies must improve awareness and continue a welcome expansion of
birth control information. Governments should also continue
modernizing adoption laws. From all evidence, the love and generosity
of would-be adoptive parents are bountiful. Judging by the story of
Moses, many abandonments and adoptions have had positive outcomes
throughout history.</TE>
<TE>   Parenting is often menial, often rewarding and, yes, often tough
duty. There's no licensing required. Most of us learn as we go--and
from the parents we had. And there are no guarantees, as the parents
of American Talib John Walker Lindh have learned.</TE>
<TE>   Despite our national instinct for resolution by a date certain, we
must patiently accept that this effort to protect the helpless--like
many social struggles--is not a war with a victory day but an endless
process. While our civilized society must do all it can to reduce
this unacceptable phenomenon in California and beyond, it must also
celebrate those who step forward to combat abandonments in all forms
and to cuddle their victims. When you think about it, these good
hearts far outnumber the others.</TE>

<HD>A Too-Dirty Clean Air Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When politicians begin talking about global warming, they often emit
hot air. Their rhetoric sounds tailored by pollsters to appeal to
"green" voters without getting specific about economic sacrifices.
Such talk won't be enough as the Senate responds to a global warming
plan that President Bush unveiled last week. Its challenge will be to
protect a slackened economy while repairing dangerous loopholes in
the Bush plan that would lift regulations in the short term, allowing
huge increases in pollutants that cause smog and acid rain.</LD>
<LD>   The heart of the president's ''Clear Skies'' and ''Global Climate
Change'' initiatives is an emissions trading program that would
establish pollution reduction targets, then let dirtier plants buy
credits from ones that have  lower emissions. Bush would offer small
but useful incentives: $4.6 billion in tax credits over five years to
encourage utilities to build clean generators like windmills, and
homeowners to buy solar panels or efficient cars.</LD>
<LD>   Some environmentalists argue that it's immoral to buy the right to
pollute, but emissions trading has a well-documented record of
success. As the president accurately pointed out, the national
trading program for sulfur dioxide pollution ''has reduced more air
pollution in the last decade than all other programs under the 1990
Clean Air Act combined, and by even more than the law required."</LD>
<TE>   While emissions trading is one of several useful proposals
outlined by the president, his initiatives have three glaring flaws
that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James M.
Jeffords (I-Vt.), who is to begin hearings on the plan this week,
should fix:</TE>
<TE>   * Lax standards. Bush's Clean Skies standards wouldn't even start
phasing in until 2008, and in the meantime his plan would weaken the
Clean Air Act to allow massive new increases in air pollution--a 36%
increase in smog-producing pollutants, a 50% increase in the
pollution that causes acid rain and a 73% increase in toxic mercury
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   * Lack of oversight. Bush's emissions trading plan relies on
companies to report their own reductions but has no mechanisms to
ensure accuracy and honesty.</TE>
<TE>   * Stingy research and development. In his speech, Bush said "the
world needs to develop and deploy billions of dollars of technologies
that generate energy in cleaner ways." But his fiscal 2003 budget
actually calls for a $52-million cut in federal R&amp;D on energy
efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is not the knee-jerk opponent of the environment that his
foes paint him to be. He's unfairly criticized for rejecting the
Kyoto global warming treaty last year, which required the U.S. to
reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to 7% below 1990 levels by 2012.
As Bush points out, since U.S. emissions are now about 14% over 1990
levels, compliance with the treaty would be prohibitively expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush's alternative to Kyoto is far too lax. If Congress
rubber-stamps it, the plan could let emissions levels in 2020 be 43%
higher than 1990 levels. No amount of rhetorical hot air can make
that look like progress.</TE>

<HD>Transportation: No on 42</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature has decreed that for the next five years the revenue
collected from the state sales tax on gasoline--more than $1 billion
a year--be earmarked for highways and public transportation projects.
This was probably a good idea. The state's transportation system
needs the money. There's a huge backlog of projects, and congestion
keeps getting worse.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that California voters are now being asked to lock
this provision into the state Constitution by passing Proposition 42
on the March 5 primary ballot. In general, this sort of permanent
earmarking is poor policy and lazy lawmaking. It ties the hands of
decision-makers when the money may be needed for something else. We
urge Californians to vote no on Proposition 42.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning in 1938, the motor vehicle fuel tax on gasoline and
diesel--now 18 cents per gallon--was dedicated for highway
construction. That is consistent with the federal tax, a fee for the
use of the roads. The ordinary sales tax on gasoline was added in
1971, and not confined to use on highways.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the money from the sales tax on gasoline the past 30 years
went into general state spending. But the Legislature two years ago
earmarked the sales tax for specific transportation projects from
2003 until mid-2008. Now, the Legislature has agreed to Proposition
42, which would put the spending formula into the Constitution and
decree that from 2008 on the sales tax money go to highway and
transit projects, an estimated $1.4 billion a year by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   No one can forecast the state's general needs that far into the
future. And there are other ways to pay for transportation
construction, such as through bond issues.</TE>
<TE>   One irony is that an escape clause in Proposition 42 allows the
governor and Legislature to suspend this earmarking of funds in a
fiscal emergency. This can be done by a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature with the signature of the governor. In fact, that's just
what it now takes to allocate all state spending, including the
passage of the annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   California needs a long-range transportation program with a means
of financing it. But cementing this provision in the Constitution now
would not advance that goal any further than present state law does.
Voters should reject Proposition 42.</TE>

<LD>For over 20 years in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, bombs
have been exploding daily. Each bomb creates an echo that is
distinguishable from the one before. Each bomb is capable of
destroying human life as well as life in other forms. But it is the
silent bombs that have been destroying families.</LD>
<LD>   These bombs don't have an echo, they don't have a smell, nor can
they be detected by radar. These bombs are the cries of the innocent
children of Afghanistan who have been falling into graves for years.
The only footprint they leave behind is a small piece of stone
indicating that it is the grave of an innocent child and a helpless,
shattered family. These kids are dying of malnutrition, lack of food,
lack of vaccinations, injuries and other types of preventable
diseases.</LD>
<LD>   The World Economic Forum that met recently in New York and the
international organizations are trying to help to control this
situation but, unfortunately, time is running out for most of these
kids. The current interim government needs to take this issue very
seriously by providing security and full assistance to these
organizations. Any delay in this matter could jeopardize the future
of Afghanistan.</LD>

<HD>Writers Compete to Bag the Nash Equilibrium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nash equilibrium is really not as complex as Bart Kosko makes it
sound (Commentary, Feb. 13). Imagine a number of stores, all selling
a particular brand of computer. Some of the stores provide lots of
hand-holding and personal support; some are discounters; some are in
between. Each has found a market niche in which to succeed.
Naturally, the prices at which these stores sell their computers
vary, although each charges the maximum it has found to be
successful. That is a Nash equilibrium.</LD>
<LD>   No store can raise its price, since it has already discovered that
raising the price will drive away customers and reduce profits. No
store will lower its price, since it has found that doing so will not
attract enough new customers to make the reduction worthwhile. No
store will add or remove services, since that will reduce profits or
drive away core customers. Each store has optimized its strategy with
respect to the other stores and to the customers who make up the
overall market. They are in equilibrium, and nothing any store can do
on its own can improve its situation.</LD>
<TE>   The only way things can change is if some external event modifies
the world in which they are all living. The computer manufacturer may
change its prices drastically, or it may make its computers so easy
to use that no one needs extra personal attention. When something
like that happens, the stores have to rethink their strategies.
Eventually, another equilibrium will develop, and the situation will
remain stable until some new external event triggers another change.</TE>

<TE>   Kosko misuses an analogy to explain John Nash's groundbreaking
theory. He compares two competitive situations: children competing
for a hundred-dollar bill amid less-desirable pennies and men
competing for the most desirable woman (a blond) amid less desirable
women (the brunets). The Nash equilibrium would lead the men to avoid
competition by skipping the blond and winning favor with her usually
ignored sidekicks. If they all went for the blond, at most one, and
likely none, would be successful and no fallback position would exist
with the irritated brunets. All risk ending up with nothing, so the
choice is clear.</TE>
<TE>   In the children's example, obtaining the hundred-dollar bill is
achievable. After one child gets the hundred, a fallback position
remains and the other children revert to grabbing pennies. Unlike the
ego-bruised brunets, the pennies would be collected with ease and
everyone would end up with something, clearly a better choice for
all.</TE>

<LD>Re "Enron Is But a Pebble in the Wave," Commentary, Feb. 13: That
"pebble in the wave" will be just the first sign of an impending
avalanche if it doesn't prompt some changes in the way the me-first
American economy operates these days. If James Pinkerton is correct
that "the future still belongs to market forces," then we could all
be in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   What's needed are: corporate boards and executives who will stand
up to the investors who greenmail them into pursuing short-term
profits at the expense of long-term growth and stability;
institutional investors who stop acting like day traders in
responding frantically to non-news; and CFOs who know that padding
your bottom line with derivatives is a lot like expecting to win
every time you walk into a Vegas casino.</LD>
<LD>   And if the Bush people were playing footsie under the table with
the Enron execs who perpetrated all these deceits on a selfish,
gullible investing public, it makes a Republican like me want to
explore alternatives.</LD>

<TE>   Pinkerton's desperately comical defense of deregulation evokes an
image of a vampire trying to claw the stake out of its own heart.
Laissez faire government policies toward big business were
resoundingly discredited during the Teddy Roosevelt administration
and again in 1929 when rampant overspeculation helped trigger the
Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle is merely history, and human nature, repeating
itself. Hopefully, the lesson has finally been learned this time.
Deregulation is dead. And may it rot in hell where it belongs.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Lay's Silence Draws Wrath From Senators," Business, Feb. 13:
It saddens me to know that the top Enron executives have not been
arrested and placed in jail. Do we have no understanding of
white-collar crime? In the aftermath of so many Americans' ruined
financial lives, we are subjected to watching these now-wealthy
executives, with their bevy of attorneys, parade in front of Congress
and plead the 5th Amendment--or ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time we are also subjected to congressional
grandstanding, with every member of the committee feeling entitled to
time in the sun, even if it means compromising subsequent legal
action. Why haven't these executives been arrested? Punishment is
their just reward and our only meaningful deterrent.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Feb. 13 letter from Roger J. Buffington attempts to taint both
parties equally with the brush of the Enron scandal. He is way off
base. Seventy-five percent of all Enron contributions went to the
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lay was George W. Bush's good friend and confidant. He and
Enron contributed more than $700,000 to Bush's political campaigns.
The Bush administration is filled with ex-Enron employees and
stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   It's obvious that the Bush energy policy was written by Enron
executives. And for those who say it wasn't, well, there is an easy
way to find out. Let Vice President Cheney release all the notes of
his energy policy meetings and let the public decide.</TE>

<LD>With all of the current concern for safety and security aboard
aircraft, why do the airlines continue to serve alcohol (but have
discontinued serving food)? Does it make sense, as has recently
occurred, to have a passenger down a scotch and then proceed to kick
the cockpit door in?</LD>

<LD>A number of people have written saying that when the government
borrows from the Social Security trust fund, all that it leaves in
place of the money is an IOU, a U.S. Treasury bond. They complain
that these bonds will someday have to be paid off by taxes. While
this is true, it is also true for all the other $5 trillion worth of
U.S. Treasury bonds that the government has issued over the years.
Many of these U.S. bonds are held by banks, insurance companies and
other pension funds. These too will have to be paid off from taxes.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. bonds are still regarded as the safest investment in the
world and carry the lowest rate of interest. No one can borrow money
at an interest rate lower than the U.S. pays. If these bonds ever
become worthless, then all other bonds will be worthless too.</LD>

<LD>"Simon an Eager but Rookie Politician" (Feb. 12) did a good job
painting the character of Bill Simon. He is eager to help California,
and he is running a campaign that is unusual in today's political
arena. His detractors claim he is a "rich political newcomer" hoping
that his "wealth can buy the race." They point to him not voting in
three primaries, to which Simon admits "there's no excuse."</LD>
<LD>   Since when did a person's wealth and honesty become a negative?
Besides, if experience is so important, why aren't today's
politicians doing a better job? I urge all Californians to ignore the
ads and take a hard look at the character and the issues each
candidate represents.</LD>

<TE>   I think the Davis ads were more than fair ("Davis' Riordan Ads Are
a Smoke Screen," letters, Feb. 13). They mostly showed Richard
Riordan on videotape with his own words. However, the Riordan
anti-Davis ads claiming that Gov. Gray Davis has received more Enron
money than any other candidate is a flat-out lie.</TE>
<TE>   "The Company Presidency" (Opinion, Feb. 10) reveals that Enron
gave millions to the Bush dynasty over the years, to the degree that
it appeared they were synonymous in their ends and means. Enron
reportedly gave $300,000 to Bush's inaugural party alone, three times
what was alleged to have been given to Davis. I used to have a
modicum of respect for Riordan, but blaming Davis for the California
energy rip-off that was clearly designed and implemented by Enron and
the Republicans has soured me on the belief that any Republican can
be trusted to be independently moderate.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Jones Takes Aim at Riordan's Wife," Feb. 13: Bill Jones
contends that Riordan should not be the Republican Party's
gubernatorial nominee because his wife, a Democrat, supports that
party. Jones should throw in the towel and go back to his ranch. He
just lost the vote of any self-respecting woman. The 19th Amendment
grants a woman the right to vote and participate fully in the
political process. So what if a wife and husband disagree about their
votes? James Carville and Mary Matalin do, but that has not stopped
the Democrats and Republicans from hiring them as consultants to
battle each other. Jones needs to learn that a woman is not
subservient to her husband's political whims.</TE>

<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jones is the best Republican candidate for governor. He has the
statewide experience, the knowledge of the issues and the presence
necessary to beat Davis in November, and he demonstrated as much in
the Feb. 13 GOP debate. In fact, the chief strike against the "three
strikes" author is the fear that he may lack the money necessary to
win the governorship. Jones has the courage to stand his ground
against millionaires Simon and Riordan, both ideologically and
fiscally.</TE>

<HD>Ken Lay: A Prisoner of His Own Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN BERGLAS</AU>
<BD>Steven Berglas, a faculty member of the Harold Price
Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, the Anderson School of Management
at UCLA, is the author of "Reclaiming the Fire: How Successful People
Overcome Burnout" (Random House, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why did Kenneth L. Lay do it?</LD>
<LD>   Pundits from every corner of academe are weighing in on this
question. But the countless analysts who claim that the former Enron
Corp. chairman lied out of greed are wrong.</LD>
<LD>   After 25 years of studying and counseling self-destructive
executives whose behavior was at least as abnormal as Lay's, I can
guarantee that what drove him--or, more accurately, caused him to
freeze in his tracks as Enron's financial house of cards was
collapsing--was far more complex.</LD>
<TE>   Consider what is arguably Lay's greatest offense: In late October
2001, despite receiving several warnings about Enron's accounting
practices, Lay promised that Enron would again be wildly profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Many Enron insiders who had heard the same warnings found Lay's
statements and inaction bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   Yet one of the best-kept secrets of executive psychology is that,
once you achieve success, you become a prisoner to the business model
that brought you acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Before its collapse, Enron was the Microsoft of energy, primarily
because of Lay's brilliance. He took a garden-variety company--a
union of two pipeline companies--and propelled it to Fortune 100
status. Rather than merely delivering gas to customers, Lay exploited
the recent deregulation of pipelines, realigning Enron so that it
could trade, at a huge profit, the product that others had to drill
wells to extract.</TE>
<TE>   The success of this paradigm shift set the stage for Lay's
undoing. Rather than sticking to gas, Enron branched into trading
whatever seemed tradable--water, coal, fiber-optic capacity and so
on.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, Lay stretched this model too far. Before he could
realize the damage he had done, success had warped his thinking.
Rather than remaining true to the swashbuckling soul that enabled him
to seize an opportunity, he grew hyperconservative and became blindly
adherent to the business model responsible for his success.</TE>
<TE>   Why else would Lay ignore Enron Vice President Sherron S.Watkins'
memo warning that "improper accounting practices" could destroy the
corporation? A person who was not overcommitted to his self-styled,
abstruse accounting practices would have immediately done an
about-face to salvage whatever viable resources he could.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lay continued to tout the health of Enron and, implicitly, his
own business model, just as gamblers who have a "system" that wins
don't see that they're throwing good money after bad as losses mount
up.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists call this type of management inflexibility
"escalation of commitment"--a process as easy to understand as it is
devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Reluctant to face embarrassment by acknowledging that their
success has evaporated, many achievers elect to stay the course far
longer than they should. Those accustomed to success become
overcommitted to bad decisions either by ignoring or suppressing
contradictory information, or by psychologically distorting feedback
that casts their judgment in a critical light.</TE>
<TE>   By donning rose-colored glasses and insistently sticking to their
defunct business model, many successful executives fail to see
warnings that they are on a collision course with disaster.</TE>
<TE>   History is littered with failed chief executives who suffered an
escalation of commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Kenneth H. Olsen, founder of Digital Equipment Corp.
After leading DEC to the top of its industry by building
minicomputers, he refused to acknowledge the threat to his business
model posed by personal computers. At a conference in 1974, Olsen
boldly proclaimed, "There is no reason for any individual to have a
computer in their home." Shortly thereafter, DEC was nearly bankrupt
and Olsen was gone.</TE>
<TE>   This argument is neither an apology for Lay nor an effort to
exonerate him. He is responsible for failing to exercise his
fiduciary responsibilities. I do, however, urge caution before
judging his motives. Contrary to Freud, smoking a cigar is typically
far more complex than merely seeking a good smoke.</TE>

<HD>Tuvalu Sinks Today--the Rest of Us Tomorrow?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSHUA S. REICHERT</AU>
<BD>Joshua S. Reichert directs the environment program at
the Pew Charitable Trusts.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, the world will little note nor long
remember the inhabitants of the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu. But
these 11,000 people, who live on nine coral atolls a few hundred
miles northwest of American Samoa, have earned a distinction, however
dubious. They may comprise the first country to pay the ultimate
price for a changing climate: national extinction. Rising sea levels
are gradually inundating Tuvalu.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the citizens of Tuvalu started looking for a new home,
appealing to New Zealand and Australia to help in the full-scale
evacuation of Tuvalu's population. After an apparent rebuff from
Australia, the first group of Tuvalu evacuees is due to leave for New
Zealand this year. And on the nearby island nation of Kiribati, a
similar future may be in store because rising ocean water is
beginning to destroy coastal roads and crops.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of Tuvalu reminds us that the world really is heating up
and that global warming is not just an environmentalist scare tactic.
The 1990s was the hottest decade on record. Worldwide, glaciers are
in retreat and ocean levels are rising. If current trends persist,
Montana's Glacier National Park might well be without glaciers in 30
years. Likewise, Africa's celebrated snows of Kilimanjaro might soon
melt into history.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the efforts by some industry groups to discredit the
science behind global warming, the U.S. public doesn't buy it.
Indeed, recent polls show that a majority of Americans are concerned
about the impacts of global warming on the health of people and the
environment and believe that the U.S. government should take action
to prevent it.</TE>
<TE>   There are good reasons why the average American should care about
global warming. Our cities will get hotter, and heat stress mortality
among the elderly will likely rise. Higher temperatures will lead to
higher sea levels, which means that many coastal areas such as New
Orleans' French Quarter and lower Manhattan will be at risk from
flooding unless billions are spent on dikes and other measures.</TE>
<TE>   Another likely outcome of a warmer world is the spread of vector-
and waterborne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and dengue.</TE>
<TE>   The American Public Health Assn. already has issued a resolution
calling for the government to do something about this.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential effects of global warming include the likelihood
of more hurricanes, windstorms and droughts, reduced water
availability and water quality, greater air pollution and the demise
of large numbers of plant and animal species.</TE>
<TE>   What can we do? For starters, we must stop denying reality.
Tuvalu's inhabitants surely aren't. The Earth's temperature is
increasing, and we must act to prevent or at least lessen the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, a great many things can be done. Many businesses can
and are beginning to take voluntary measures that have the dual
benefits of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions while also saving
money.</TE>
<TE>   But voluntary actions alone won't solve the climate change
problem. What's needed is a serious commitment by the U.S.
government, which has done virtually nothing, despite the fact that
our nation is the world's largest contributor of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, we need an economywide climate policy that includes
mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Constructing such a
system takes time and requires political will.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there are immediate steps that can be taken:
Specifically, federal policies should be enacted that limit emissions
from dirty power plants, increase the fuel efficiency of cars and
trucks, provide incentives to businesses to cut emissions and
increase the federal investment in developing clean-energy
technologies and getting them to market.</TE>
<TE>   It's too late for Tuvalu, but taking these steps will help the
rest of us by curbing rising temperatures, giving us cleaner air and
providing more sustainable, dependable and ultimately cheaper ways to
meet our energy needs.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad bargain for the future.</TE>

<HD>Problems in Latin America Can't Wait on Bush Forever</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRES ROZENTAL</AU>
<BD>Andres Rozental, a former special advisor to President
Vicente Fox, chairs the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far from the campaign against terrorism and the theater of war in
Central Asia, the Western Hemisphere appears to have dropped off
Washington's radar screen. Anti-terrorism has become the linchpin of
U.S. foreign policy decision-making.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, Latin America has been left to fend for itself.</LD>
<LD>   The social and economic shambles that today characterize
Argentina, the unforeseeable political future of Venezuela and the
precarious peace process in Colombia are just some of the issues
crying out for sustained U.S. attention.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico, however, is probably the most powerful indicator of the
distance that has developed as the U.S. deals with new challenges to
its security.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Latin America is watching for signs that the U.S. has not
forgotten it, and those signs are inevitably measured by Washington's
relations with Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico was one of the Bush administration's first and probably
paramount foreign policy success stories.</TE>
<TE>   During the early days of his presidency, George W. Bush and his
foreign policy team recognized the need to meet President Vicente Fox
halfway in his gamble to dramatically alter the face of U.S.-Mexico
relations. Immigration, border infrastructure, counter-narcotics
cooperation, trade and even hemispheric issues were at the core of an
agenda that Bush and Fox used to chart a visionary path for their
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Today that bold bilateral agenda is stalled. All eyes will be on
President Bush during his scheduled trip to Monterrey, Mexico, in
March to see if he provides a jump-start to that moribund agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Washington's immediate concerns regarding terrorism, the
fundamental reasons for its current inattention to Mexico are not
easy to fathom, given what is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's prompt actions to bolster security along its border with
the U.S. and its willingness to support anti-terrorism measures at
the United Nations and the Organization of American States clearly
demonstrate that it is a trustworthy ally in the struggle against
terrorism. Fox and Bush consult each other on a regular basis, and
Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda and U.S. Secretary of State
Colin Powell have developed a personal friendship.</TE>
<TE>   The challenges and opportunities identified by Bush and Fox during
their numerous meetings in 2001 still are there to be tackled and
exploited.</TE>
<TE>   Migration from Mexico to the United States, and the effect it has
on labor markets and productivity in both countries, needs to be
addressed. Enhanced energy cooperation at a time of increasing
vulnerability of oil supplies is pending. Yet U.S. interests in
pursuing its relationship with Mexico seem contingent solely on the
pace of events in Afghanistan, the Mideast and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   This current state of affairs cannot go on.</TE>
<TE>   The United States can ill-afford to have Latin America turn its
back on it in the search for solutions to the region's pressing
problems. During the past decade, most of the region has bet on
democracy and open markets as a model for development. The risks to
the hemisphere of backtracking from those choices in reaction to
neglect by the U.S. cannot be underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans are still seeking jobs across the border, and the status
of many of them in the U.S. remains unresolved. Border security still
requires mechanisms for the secure and efficient flow of people and
goods, trade disputes must be resolved, law enforcement cooperation
needs streamlining and water resources must be wisely allocated.</TE>
<TE>   A failure to produce long-term agreements regarding these and
other issues would not only set back the relationship between Mexico
City and Washington but also send a politically unsettling and thorny
message for Fox's ambitious agenda of political and economic reform
in Mexico. This failure could foster powerful political and public
opinion opposition in Mexico regarding closer ties with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has a unique opportunity to build a relationship
that will have a profound effect on North America and beyond.
Explaining to the American people why Mexico--in the aftermath of one
of the most serious challenges the U.S. has faced--is crucial to the
well-being of his nation could prove to be one of Bush's finest
hours.</TE>

<HD>Cleaning Up Belmont Is No Job for the LAUSD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRYAN L. STEELE</AU>
<BD>Bryan L. Steele, a former teacher, was the lead
investigator for the Joint Legislative Audit Committee in 1998-99 and
is the author of "Road to Belmont" (Foreshadow Press, 2000). E-mail:
BryanLSteele @yahoo.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, experts assert that the Belmont Learning Complex can be
finished safely and efficiently. But wait, haven't we heard this
before? And who are these experts?</LD>
<LD>   The notion of expertise denotes relevant firsthand knowledge. Yet
the Belmont situation is unique and so such expertise probably does
not exist.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is there deadly hydrogen sulfide and explosive methane
gas perpetually rising through the ground, but this 35-acre
site--intended to be used for a public school attended by
children--also is littered with unidentified wildcat oil wells and
buildings constructed over hot spots of industrial contamination.</LD>
<TE>   Buildings already constructed on the site will require
after-the-fact remedies.</TE>
<TE>   Those who still want to use Belmont as a high school argue that
established, "off-the-shelf" environmental safety systems can make
the site safe.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a huge difference between applying established
remedies to known situations and applying those same systems to
unknown situations.</TE>
<TE>   There is equal uncertainty over Belmont's final cost. Contractors
are free to underbid the project because they know that additional
expenses can be offset through future "change orders." There also is
the unknown cost of maintenance and supervision over the next 50
years. Future students and staff also could claim that their
illnesses are linked to Belmont's hazards. Because Belmont presents
so many unknowns, it is impossible to predict the final cost.</TE>
<TE>   And who will oversee this theoretical system of blowers, tubes,
sensors, filters, alarms and vacuum pumps above and below 35 acres of
contiguous synthetic fabric that will be used to contain the hazards?
The Los Angeles Unified School District will shoulder primary
responsibility, an unquestionably sobering thought.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to outside consultants for additional oversight offers
little solace, given the debacle of Jefferson New Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson was completed in 1997 atop a South-Central Los Angeles
industrial site that formerly housed, among other industries, a World
War II defense plant and chrome-plating facility.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath Jefferson, according to state regulators, is the
highest concentration of chromium 6 contamination in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Like Belmont, the site was never fully tested until the California
Legislature began making inquiries. Today, students attend classes
while cleanup continues.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Legislature's Joint Legislative Audit Committee
began looking at Jefferson, an improperly designed vacuum filter by
the school's main entrance had spewed toxic fumes onto students and
staff for months. Yet the school district's outside environmental
consultant issued a glowing report that all was well. The district's
outside counsel told a legislative audit hearing that Jefferson was
safe when published data clearly indicated otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   No one should rely on state environmental agencies to oversee
Belmont. The directors of the California Environmental Protection
Agency and the Department of Toxic Substances Control both are
gubernatorial appointees. It takes millions of dollars to run for
governor. Who makes large donations to the governor's race but land
developers, law firms and California's ever-growing environmental
cleanup industry?</TE>
<TE>   Our public education system is not equipped to manage school
construction on contaminated land. The school board should reassert
its previous decision on Belmont and demand that administrators

<LD>The Hubble Space Telescope, which has produced images from the
distant reaches of the universe since its early "vision" problems
were corrected in 1993, is getting an even stronger pair of glasses.</LD>
<LD>   Later this month, the space shuttle Columbia will carry astronauts
to upgrade the orbiting telescope, NASA said. One main piece of
equipment will be the Advanced Camera for Surveys, which scientists
say will have 10 times the power of the camera it will replace.</LD>
<LD>   "If you had two fireflies six feet apart in Tokyo, Hubble's vision
with ACS will be so fine that it will be able to tell from
Washington, D.C., that they were two different fireflies instead of
one," said Holland Ford, who led the team that built the camera.</LD>

<LD>The dugong, a mammal considered to be the inspiration for seafarers'
tales of mermaids, is disappearing from the planet, an indication of
the degradation of coastal environments, the United Nations
Environment Program said last week. The animal is gone from many of
its habitats in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea and is on the
brink of vanishing from the Indian Ocean off East Africa, the agency
said.</LD>
<LD>   The mammals, which resemble sea cows or manatees, can grow to
about 10 feet in length and weigh nearly 900 pounds. They depend on
sea grass beds for food. In many areas of the world, however, sea
grass beds are being cleared for development or smothered by silt and
mud from runoff caused by overgrazing and deforestation.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: Is it true that some animals sleep with only half their brain?</LD>
<LD>   A: Yes. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have shown that some species
of birds and some aquatic mammals sleep with only half their brain at
one time, while the other half remains alert and functioning. Such
sleep habits allow the mammals to continue swimming and rise to the
surface for air while at least part of their brain is getting a good
night's rest. The half of the brain sleeping apparently alternates.
For birds, the ploy is apparently a way to keep on the lookout for
predators. Researchers at Indiana State University recently reported
that in a lineup of sleeping mallard ducks, the birds on the ends of
the line kept their outer eye open and responded quickly to the
presence of potential danger.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 130-million-year-old newly discovered fossil of a small meat-eating
dinosaur found in China is further proof of the evolutionary link
between dinosaurs and birds, scientists say. ''This animal is not a
direct ancestor to birds but it is a very close cousin. It is from a
group called troodontids which is closely related to birds,'' Peter
Makovicky of the Field Museum in Chicago reported in the Feb. 14
Nature.</LD>
<LD>   The new dinosaur, called Sinovenator changii, was probably
feathered and is almost the same age as the oldest known bird,
Archaeopteryx. Sinovenator was a two-legged predator like the mighty
Tyrannosaurus rex, but it was the size of a large chicken. It had a
bird-like shoulder joint, a wishbone and a pelvic bone that points
backward, similar to modern birds.</LD>

<LD>Cocaine speeds the spread of HIV in mice and probably does the same
in humans, according to UCLA researchers. Dr. Gayle Baldwin and her
colleagues injected cocaine or a placebo into mice with an HIV
infection. They reported Thursday in the Journal of Infectious
Diseases that the mice who received cocaine had 200 times as many
viral particles in their blood as those that received a placebo.
After 10 days, they also had twice as many HIV-infected cells. The
mice receiving cocaine also had fewer disease-fighting CD4 cells.</LD>

<LD>People were lined up for at least a half a mile--staring, transfixed.
Kids on bikes stopped in their tracks, leaning with elbows on
handlebars. An old lady in her walker turned to look. Fathers lifted
toddlers on their shoulders. The roller-bladers braked. Dogs sat
silent on leashes, waiting for signs of life from suddenly still
masters. Homeless people wrapped in blankets came to look. Even the
runners paused, putting aerobics on hold.</LD>
<LD>   At first, I thought something horrible had happened. But, no. It
was only (only?) a sunset at Santa Monica beach. In a singular act of
community, L.A. sun worshipers lived up to their name, bidding Old
Sol adieu with fitting reverence. Or at least, bonne nuit.</LD>
<LD>   What is it about a sunset? Surely, it's not just the color. You
can get almost the same thing from a good box of paints.</LD>
<TE>   Or even, if you like to play, by shining a flashlight through
water sprinkled through with powdered milk. The milk, it turns out,
makes particles of just the right size to scatter the blue light
preferentially out the side, leaving only the red to travel the
distance. It's exactly what air does to sunlight. So if you shine the
yellow flashlight through the long end of a glass loaf pan, the sides
will look sky blue, but down at the end, you'll see a shimmering
red-orange ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not that hard to cook up a sunset in a pan.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe a loaf pan full of colored light isn't the same as a
whole sky aglow. But still, I think there's more to the way the sun
moves us than mere (mere?) beauty.</TE>
<TE>   At some level, I think even people who know nothing about physics
understand just how remarkable a thing it is, this yellow star of
ours. Turning matter into energy as surely as Rumpelstiltskin turned
straw into gold. Except that the sun's gold is really manna from
heaven, the stuff we eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   (The energy you use to read this sentence is powered, ultimately,
by sunlight--perhaps first soaked up by some grass that got digested
by a cow before it turned into the milk that made the cheese that
topped the pizza. But sunlight, just the same.)</TE>
<TE>   It's a godlike power, for sure. Perhaps that's why people were so
upset when Galileo published a letter in 1613 suggesting that the sun
was less than perfect; that it broke out sporadically with
imperfections, like ordinary folk. The dark blotches Galileo saw
suggested that the sun was up to something--not just some lazy orb,
as the ancients had thought, with nothing to do but roll around
heaven all day.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we know the dark spots are relatively cool areas where the
sun's magnetic fields get knotted up, twisted around by the star's
rapidly spinning, electrically charged atmosphere. It's a mystery,
still, how those spots come and go, and the more astronomers learn,
the more interesting the mystery seems to get.</TE>
<TE>   The spots, which are associated with intense magnetic activity,
come and go in 11-year cycles. As the last cycle's spots disappear
near the sun's equator, new ones pop up at the poles--but with the
magnetic poles reversed. No one can figure out how a star manages to
turn itself inside out at such regular intervals, or why.</TE>
<TE>   Or figure this: The entire sun pulses in regular five-minute
intervals. (No wonder it's the whole planet's heartthrob.) In
addition, it rings in dozens of different harmonics, which are now
being studied by the equivalent of Earth-based stethoscopes placed
strategically round the globe.</TE>
<TE>   There's only so much you can learn from a distance, however, so
NASA has sent up a spacecraft to bask in the sun's glow for a couple
of years, collecting the star's hot breath on silicon detectors. In
2004, the craft is due to swoop down over Utah, where the samples
will be collected by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The mission, aptly named Genesis, is after no less than the story
of our own origins.</TE>
<TE>   Some 4.5 billion years ago, the sun, planets and moons all
condensed out of the same maternal gas cloud; when the planets spun
off, the sun held on to more than 95% of that primordial stuff. It
still does.</TE>
<TE>   Humanity really is a chip off that old block. If we can bottle the
stuff and bring it home to our laboratories, we'll find out a lot
more about ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   As the days get longer, I realize how much I've missed the sun
during its long hibernation. How much I appreciate all it does for
us: putting tails on comets; driving weather; making pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, here comes the sun. Goodness, gracious, great balls of
fire.</TE>

<HD>Healing Body by Fakery</HD>
<DH>Health: Placebos, be they sugar or some other innocuous
substance, seem to yield short-term results. But why?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The placebo effect--the perplexing ability of a sugar pill or a
harmless injection to alleviate some ailments--is causing genuine
bewilderment among scientists.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, researchers at the University of Copenhagen reviewed
data from 114 clinical drug trials involving 7,500 people and found
so little statistical evidence of a placebo effect that they
questioned whether it even exists.</LD>
<LD>   Hard on the heels of that finding, three independent teams of
scientists now report the opposite: For the first time, medical
imaging studies are offering direct clinical evidence that the power
of belief harnessed by a placebo can cause changes in a patient's
brain.</LD>
<TE>   "It is hard to quantify the placebo effect--the effect of hope, of
belief, of the imagination," said Harvard University medical expert
Ted Kaptchuk, who studies alternative medicine. "These studies are
fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   The research findings are the newest twist in a fierce debate as
old as Western science over the mystery of healing and how the mind
can influence the body. The growing curiosity about alternative
medicine has heightened interest in the question of whether--or to
what extent--placebos can affect health.</TE>
<TE>   The imaging studies reveal that people who are persuaded to take
sugar pills or some other harmless placebo as a treatment for
depression and other ills can undergo striking, albeit temporary,
changes in brain activity and neural chemistry as their condition
improves.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that something people thought was just a psychological
process--or even questioned the existence of--is a physical process
in the brain," said UCLA psychologist Andrew Leuchter, who led one of
the research groups.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the exciting thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Effects of Placebo</TE>
<TE>   Using several different scanning techniques to monitor neural
activity, the scientists discovered that a placebo can:</TE>
<TE>   *Alter brain function in patients suffering from clinical
depression. The UCLA researchers found that those whose spirits were
lifted by the placebo showed greater brain activity in regions
associated with mood and memory, as measured by
electroencephalography. Antidepression medications reduced activity
in the same brain regions, according to the research published in the
American Journal of Psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   *Change the brain chemistry of people afflicted with Parkinson's
disease, which develops as production of dopamine in the brain drops.
Using positron emission tomography (PET), researchers at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver determined that
injections of a harmless saline solution boosted dopamine levels in
damaged neurons just as well as a drug commonly used to treat the
disease, the team reported in Science.</TE>
<TE>   *Activate the same pain control networks in the brain as a
prescription painkiller. Swedish and Finnish researchers used PET
scanning to determine that medication and a placebo relieved pain
among volunteers in a controlled study. Both also heightened activity
in the same brain region, the researchers reported earlier this month
in Science.</TE>
<TE>   "We must accept that there is more to the placebo effect than just
a pill," said neurophysiologist Martin Ingvar in Stockholm, the
senior scientist on the Swedish research team. "I find the placebo
effect a very interesting illustration of how by social interaction
you can influence the well-being of your fellow man."</TE>
<TE>   Each study in its own way is a testament to the mind's
inexplicable and often baffling power to affect health.</TE>
<TE>   "These all are pretty fundamental neurological processes," said
medical anthropologist Daniel E. Moerman of the University of
Michigan at Dearborn. "But it is pretty clear they are open to
manipulation by belief and meaning and ritual and someone waving a
magic syringe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frequent Studies</TE>
<TE>   For all the controversy, there is no shortage of studies attesting
to the odd effects of a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on what a patient is told, a sip of sugar water can
settle a queasy stomach or induce vomiting. With a few brushstrokes
of a harmless red dye, researchers have been able to make some
patients' warts disappear. Placebos can often make pain go away. Red
sugar pills, however, make a better painkiller than dummy blue, green
or yellow pills, researchers have discovered. Inert blue pills make
better sedatives than pink ones.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies suggest that placebo treatments can improve blood
pressure, cholesterol levels and heart rate. They can, for some
people, temporarily alleviate allergies. The effects can vary from
country to country.</TE>
<TE>   In studies of new drugs, in which the effect of the medication is
tested against a placebo, 35% to 75% of patients get some benefit
from a dummy pill or injection, although the effect often doesn't
last very long.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist Irving Kirsch at the University of Connecticut, who
studies the effect of patients' expectations on medical treatment, is
convinced that for those suffering from clinical depression, the
placebo effect is all-powerful. Kirsch and his colleague Guy
Sapirstein reviewed 19 clinical trials of antidepressant drugs,
involving 2,318 patients. They came to the conclusion that most, if
not all, of the therapeutic benefit of the drugs could be attributed
to the placebo effect.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, researchers have been hard pressed to understand
clinically what was happening when someone was persuaded that a
harmless injection or a pill truly could treat an ailment.</TE>
<TE>   Sorting out the effect of a placebo is difficult in part because
so many patients get better on their own regardless of the treatment.
The act of seeking treatment appears in some cases to exert a
powerful influence on health. And sometimes, the attention that comes
from being a volunteer in a medical test is enough to make someone
feel better.</TE>
<TE>   A patient's own belief in the healing properties of a treatment is
a powerful additive, several researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you have a change in experience, you have to have some
change in the brain," said Kirsch. "As far as we know, when we talk
about somebody's mind, we are talking about their brain and nervous
system."</TE>
<TE>   The new research, said Dr. Howard Brody, a placebo expert at
Michigan State University, "reminds us of the intimate connections
between the mind and the body."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Says Top Staff Didn't Order Shredding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>An internal investigation by Andersen has determined the accounting
firm's top managers were not responsible for the shredding of
documents at Enron Corp., according to a published report.</LD>
<LD>   In the issue of Newsweek that will arrive on newsstands today, the
magazine reports that the investigation has tentatively concluded
that the shredding disclosed last month ''resulted from collusion
between Enron employees and members of Andersen's Houston office.''</LD>
<LD>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton told the Associated Press on
Sunday that he had not seen the article. But he said the
investigation has not been completed and that ''no conclusions have
been reached at this time.''</LD>
<TE>   The magazine reports that it is not clear what evidence supports
the conclusion of collusion between the Enron employees and workers
in Andersen's Houston office.</TE>
<TE>   The findings by investigators appear to be in line with what the
accounting firm already has said about the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   The shredding started after an attorney in the firm's Chicago
headquarters sent her colleagues in the Houston office a copy of
Andersen's document retention policy.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to Newsweek, the investigation determined that the
shredding had nothing to do with that letter.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has blamed David Duncan, who was the company's chief
auditor on the Enron account until his recent firing. Duncan invoked
his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to
answer questions when called before a House subcommittee last month.
Several other auditors also have been fired. Enron has since fired
Andersen as its auditor.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Trade Offers Little Hope for Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Trade often provides an economic escape hatch for countries that have
suffered devaluations. Their weakened currencies make exports
suddenly more competitive on international markets, fueling foreign
exchange, business activity and job growth at home.</LD>
<LD>   But trade prospects are dismal in Argentina, which recently
devalued its currency. The reasons include a scarcity of credit and a
long decline in technology investment that has left industry
unprepared for an export push. A freeze on foreign currency transfers
has brought deal-making to a halt, and political uncertainty has made
exporters and their customers wary of new commitments.</LD>
<LD>   A case in point is Sancor, a producer of dairy products based in
Argentina's Santa Fe province. Because the country's banks
essentially have shut down, the company is having trouble getting the
credit it needs to export its powdered milk and cheese, even though
it has a successful history of doing business in 35 countries.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to say what's going to happen in Argentina. I
wouldn't dare, in the short- and midterm," said Sancor export
director Hernan Tevez. "Planning in this context is very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The gloomy trade picture is one reason many observers are
pessimistic about Argentina's prospects for emerging from its
economic crisis, at least in the short run.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine exports are expected to decline by 5% this year, said
Enrique Mantilla, president of the Argentine National Exporters
Chamber, known by its Spanish initials CERA.</TE>
<TE>   That's despite the fact that the country's goods are about half as
expensive in dollars as they were before Argentina's currency was
devalued last month, when it abandoned its peg to the U.S. dollar and
let the peso float freely on international markets.</TE>
<TE>   When Brazil devalued its currency in 1999, its exports fell about
5% that year, but its economy still grew by nearly 1%. Argentina's
total economic output could shrink as much as 7% this year, its fifth
year of negative economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilwhiles exports roared back the year after its devaluation, but
the prognosis for Argentina is much more clouded, given its other
economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's biggest trade handicaps are the collapse of its
banking system and the unavailability of credit, which exporters need
to finance production. With the Argentine government and corporations
defaulting on billions in foreign debt, no one is rushing to lend
firms money.</TE>
<TE>   Financing for exports was much more available in post-devaluation
Brazil, whose banking system withstood the crisis. In Mexico, many
banks failed after the currency was devalued in 1994, but exporters
frequently were able to access credit from their U.S. partners and
customers. Argentine companies, on the other hand, are having to fend
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Because it has no idea how the nation's currency will trade in
coming weeks, steel manufacturer Siderar, which typically sells 55%
of its production abroad, is reluctant to make deals. That
uncertainty makes multimillion-dollar deals in thin-margin
commodities such as steel highly risky propositions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where [exporters] are having the most difficulty, because
no one knows what will happen with the dollar," said Mantilla of
CERA.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Argentina's banking system were in better shape, many
companies would be ill-equipped to compete internationally, said
Santiago Vexina, foreign trade director of the Argentina Chamber of
Commerce. The nation's investment in technology and machinery over
the last 10 years has been woefully inadequate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the Argentine peso was so strong when it was tied
to the dollar that it made more sense for manufacturers to import the
components they needed rather than invest in the machinery,
technology and know-how to make the upgrades themselves. Now,
companies are paying the price: The devaluation has made such
investments twice as expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Around half of what Argentina imports cannot be substituted by
local suppliers, which is a problem for manufacturers," Vexina said.
"So the bad effects of the devaluation balance out the good effects."
Printing firms and packagers, which both rely on foreign components,
have been especially hurt by the devaluation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists said Argentina's recovery hinges on an
international assistance package, which many expect will include some
sort of rescue for banks.</TE>
<TE>   Without a viable banking system, Argentina will have trouble
emerging from its crisis, said Paulo Levy, researcher at the
Institute for Applied Economic Research, a Rio de Janeiro economic
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a viable banking system, Brazilwhiles recovery was
helped by its meeting austere fiscal goals in its devaluation year,
keeping inflation under 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina won't be so lucky. Inflation this year has been
projected at 25% to 50%, and observers are worried the nation may
print money to make up for a budget shortfall and reignite
hyperinflation.</TE>
<TE>   Although Brazilwhiles exports are only now beginning to pick up
momentum, Brazilian producers had the advantage of having a domestic
market four times the size of Argentina's, said Sandra Rios, an
economist with Brazil's National Confederation of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Argentina's domestic market is in the grips of a
four-year recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The devaluation in Brazil didn't hurt domestic production,
whereas it will in Argentina. That's a big difference," Rios said.
"So Argentina will face a much more difficult period."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil also had an active government financing program for
exports, something Argentina doesn't have.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many other facets of the economy, uncertainty rules
Argentina's exporters, said Mantilla of CERA.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, we had a market-oriented economic model and now the
government is imposing new regulations," Mantilla said. "Until we
know how it is all going to function, companies are on very uncertain
footing."</TE>
<TE>   Amaury de Souza, a political economist with consulting firm Techne
in Rio de Janeiro, said Argentina's best hope may be to help foster
the strengthening of Mercosur as an export platform to the rest of
the world. Mercosur is a four-nation trade bloc composed of Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.</TE>

<HD>'Channeling' Is Latest Trading Fad</HD>
<DH>Investing: Strategy of playing a single stock as it moves
within a range gets skeptical reception.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea sounds enticing enough. In a commercial that runs regularly
between CNBC's stock market reports, a twentysomething who presents
himself as an investing success reveals his secret: "Buy low, sell
high--the same stock, again and again."</LD>
<LD>   The ad is from ChannelingStocks.com, which offers investors a
seemingly simple way to make money in today's dicey market: Play
stocks that can be traded as they travel up and down through an
established price channel. The concept is to repeatedly buy at the
low end and sell at the high end.</LD>
<LD>   But some Wall Street "technical" analysts, who interpret stock
price charts and track other market trends, say ChannelingStocks,
which is owned by Stock Firm Inc., has a pitch that vastly
understates the difficulties of trading successfully.</LD>
<TE>   "That guy on the commercial, I'd like to reach out and smack him
every time he comes on," said Bill Ryder, an analyst at First Union
Securities in Richmond, Va. "The premise that a stock will continue
to move in a channel, like it's physics or something, is ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Though stocks often can be stuck in a particular range for a
while, Ryder said, "That's no guarantee the pattern will continue."
At some point a stock's price will break out of that range, to the
upside or the downside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stock Firm Chief Executive Timothy Thompson said the Port
Washington, Wis., firm, which started its ad blitz in December, has
"several thousand" customers, with 80% to 85% renewing their monthly
or quarterly subscriptions. He said the retention rate indicates
"people like the service."</TE>
<TE>   Fees are $15 a month, $40 a quarter or $120 a year. For the money,
subscribers get information on 15 "channeling" candidate stocks each
week--issues that have been trading in a range for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe there is indeed plenty of money to be made
trading stocks, rather than buying and holding, in the current choppy
market environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We've transitioned to a sideways market that could last for a
long time, and that means you're going to have to trade to make
money," said John Bollinger, head of Manhattan Beach investment firm
Bollinger Capital Management. He started his career near the end of a
16-year span that saw the Dow Jones industrial average mostly stuck
between 800 and 1,000, before it lifted off in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say the ChannelingStocks approach oversimplifies
the challenges facing traders, which include not just getting the buy
and sell points correct but absorbing commission costs, as well as
paying taxes on any short-term capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, trading strategies are always coming and going on Wall
Street. In the dot-com heyday, thousands of investors were lured into
"day trading"--rapid-fire buying and selling of hot stocks, with the
goal of making small amounts on each trade, in hopes of accumulating
big sums by day's end.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, "swing trading" has attracted investors. Swing
traders look for suddenly hot stocks that they can ride for weeks or
months, until the price momentum peters out.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than just pick a stock that is at the low end of a recent
trading range, Bollinger looks for upward momentum not only in an
individual stock but also in its industry group and broad sector, as
well as the overall market.</TE>
<TE>   "With all four oars in the water, you get the biggest burst of
speed," he said. "Even if 'XYZ' stock is moving in a channel, if its
industry group deteriorates around it, my best advice would be to
respect that deterioration and move on to something else."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, ChannelingStocks and other Web sites pitching
channeling or "rolling" stock strategies generally focus on single
issues and take a shorter-term approach.</TE>
<TE>   "If a stock 'channels' only once every four months, we'd look for
something more active," Thompson said. Stocks often channel between
their low and high price targets within days or weeks, the Web site
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Each Thursday night, ChannelingStocks releases a list of about a
dozen stocks trading near the bottom of their recent channels. It
also highlights three issues trading near the top of their channels,
for aggressive investors who wish to "short" them, or bet on a
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said the company's seven chart watchers handpick the
stocks based on patterns over the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   ChannelingStocks doesn't suggest buy or sell target prices, but
highlights the upper and lower ends of a stock's recent channel.
Users are expected to set their buy and sell targets based on how
aggressive or conservative they are.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson acknowledges that there are no guarantees any stock will
stay in a channel, and he said the site advises traders to use plenty
of caution.</TE>
<TE>   ChannelingStocks suggests, for example, that traders wait until a
stock is heading higher before buying, a concept Thompson calls
"confirming direction." If a stock has channeled between $10 and $15
and now is at $10.50, Thompson said, a trader might buy it only if it
rises to $11. At the same time, the trader might put in a standing
order to sell the stock if it rises to $13 or $14, depending on his
or her aggressiveness, or if it falls to $9.50, which would limit any
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The company also suggests customers make practice trades--trading
on paper, not with real money--for two months to learn confirming
direction and other trading nuances.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not suggesting anybody cash out their 401(k) and do this,"
Thompson said. But "it might be something for a portion of someone's
portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Investors have had mixed reactions to ChannelingStocks.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Miller, a 51-year-old window company salesman in Smock, Pa.,
who signed up in December, said that after two months of practice
trading he is close to "taking the plunge" with real money.</TE>
<TE>   "I was impressed by the tone of the Web site. They tell you not to
be greedy and just jump in," Miller said. "They encourage you to
practice, practice, practice, unlike the get-rich-quick sites out
there on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he supplements the service by researching the business
trends of any company he might invest in. "These are just charts," he
said of ChannelingStocks' ideas. "If a company misses its earnings
target, the pattern isn't going to prevent the shares from falling."</TE>
<TE>   Stephan Lewis, a 44-year-old Hermosa Beach resident who stepped
away from his job writing software books five months ago to become a
full-time stock trader, said he wouldn't touch ChannelingStocks.com
"with a 10-foot pole."</TE>
<TE>   Like many others, Lewis believes investors now face a volatile
market in which traders can thrive, but he said he prefers trading
services he considers more sophisticated. He subscribes to
TheStreet.com's new "daily swing trade" feature written by Alan
Farley, author of "The Master Swing Trader," along with another site
for active traders.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that several of the stocks ChannelingStocks lists trade for
less than $10, Lewis said "bid-ask spreads"--the difference between
the price investors must pay when buying a stock and the price they
could get by selling it immediately--could eat severely into trading
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said that during the bull market of the late 1990s, traders
had success playing "breakouts," or stocks starting to move higher
after being stuck in a range. That was one form of classic "momentum"
investing. But those are harder to find now.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's looking for some other concept," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger said it's human nature for investors to seek out "a
simplistic paradigm." But he said investors should have learned by
now that "there is no easy way to riches" in the market.</TE>

<HD>New Disk a Contender for CD's Titles</HD>
<DH>DataPlay storage format resists piracy, is backed by music
firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Digital technology is built on an elegantly simple foundation, a
universal language of ones and zeros. Yet when it comes to storing
those ones and zeros, the electronics world is a mess of incompatible
memory cards, sticks and disks.</LD>
<LD>   DataPlay Inc., a start-up bred in a Rocky Mountain hotbed for
data-storage engineers, hopes to lead consumers out of the chaos with
a new, universal format.</LD>
<LD>   A wafer-thin disk encased in a 1 1/4-inch square of plastic, each
piece of DataPlay media can hold at least five hours of CD-quality
music, one hour of video, one console-style video game, 1,000
high-resolution digital photos or 100 e-books.</LD>
<TE>   It's a masterpiece of engineering that gives at least one
multibillion-dollar business--the music industry--exactly what it
wants: a new medium that resists piracy.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 years have passed since the introduction of the
compact disc, which boosted sales by prompting music lovers to buy
new versions of the records they owned. Now CD sales are flat, and
the industry needs a jolt.</TE>
<TE>   The disks' multimedia capabilities and encryption technology could
spark new approaches to selling music, movies and other digital
material. For example, record companies could load a 500-megabyte
DataPlay disk with music videos, backstage photos, tour schedules and
older albums waiting to be unlocked for an extra fee.</TE>
<TE>   For every new format that reached mass acceptance, however, there
are a dozen or more that didn't. One reason is the fierce competition
among electronics companies, many of which bring their own formats to
market.</TE>
<TE>   A more fundamental question is whether the public will embrace any
new format for portable storage, particularly one that works only on
new devices built for that format.</TE>
<TE>   In the not-too-distant future, consumers will be connected
continuously to the Internet at high speed, and their devices will
talk to each other wirelessly. They'll download digital music and
movie files from the Web and store their collections on computer hard
drives instead of bookshelves.</TE>
<TE>   With technology like that, why would anyone need disks? That world
is still a few years away, yet some analysts say it's close enough to
spell trouble for DataPlay.</TE>
<TE>   "DataPlay is caught between a rock and a hard place, the rock
being the CD and the hard place being the advent of digital music
[online]," said analyst Mark Mooradian of Jupiter Media Metrix, a
technology research and consulting firm. "It becomes very difficult
to imagine a place for a format like DataPlay. It looks very
transitional."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Engineering Delays Push Back Debut</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, engineering delays pushed DataPlay at least
six months behind schedule. Instead of making their debut last fall
in time for the holiday-shopping season, the disks and players are
now expected in April.</TE>
<TE>   Those delays have left a number of consumer electronics and media
companies in a we'll-believe-it-when-we-see-it mode. "If DataPlay
matures to the point where it's accepted by the mass market, then we
would be more inclined to produce devices," said Phil O'Shaughnessy,
a spokesman for consumer-electronics manufacturer Creative Labs.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Volk, DataPlay's founder and chief executive, shrugs off the
delays. Factories belonging to partners in North Dakota and Taiwan
are cranking out blank DataPlay media as fast as they can make it.
Another partner in China is assembling tens of thousands of the tiny,
box-shaped "storage engines" that will read and record the disks,
supplied by optical components from DataPlay's own plant in
Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in volume production now," Volk said, adding that the rest
of the pieces are largely out of his company's control.</TE>
<TE>   DataPlay's headquarters are in Boulder, a college town that became
a mecca for data storage after IBM Corp. put a pioneering
magnetic-storage plant here a quarter-century ago. Volk made a name
for himself as an entrepreneur in that area, credited with helping a
series of companies develop the pint-sized hard drives used by
laptops, personal digital assistants and Apple's iPod MP3 player.</TE>
<TE>   After devising the concept for DataPlay in his basement four years
ago, Volk pulled together a team of experts from the magnetic and
optical-storage fields. The basic idea was simple: to create a small,
inexpensive disk that stored information as densely as a DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Turning Volk's cardboard mock-ups into working models, however,
required a series of technological leaps.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Technical Officer Dave Davies, a former 3M engineer who
helped introduce the CD-ROM, said DataPlay had to come up with much
more effective error-correction technology while dramatically cutting
the size and power consumption of the components that read and burn
the disks.</TE>
<TE>   Like a DVD recorder, the DataPlay engine uses a laser to change
the physical properties of a blank disk, creating a digital code of
bumps and pits in the disk's grooves. The optical components that do
this work are "the world's smallest by a very large margin," Davies
said.</TE>
<TE>   The disks can be recorded only once, a significant sacrifice that
DataPlay made for the sake of disk longevity and battery life. But
unlike virtually every other kind of media, the double-sided disks
can offer prerecorded material with blank space for consumers' data.</TE>
<TE>   That means consumers buying a new U2 album on DataPlay, for
example, could customize the disk with older U2 songs and pictures
from a U2 concert. Or they could buy an electronic key online to
unlock additional albums, videos or other material hidden on the
disk.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't intend to be a small CD," Volk said. "We intend to give
you the tour, the album, the video and a lot more. It's a different
consumer experience."</TE>
<TE>   Each side of a DataPlay disk has only about one-third the capacity
of a CD, but the methods it uses to compress and store audio data are
10 times as efficient. That means a single disk can hold about 80
CD-quality songs, or three albums' worth of music remastered at
better-than-CD quality.</TE>
<TE>   DataPlay ran into delays as it worked to drive down costs and set
up production lines overseas, but company officials say they've hit
all the technical marks. Now, as the first generation of DataPlay
devices goes into production, the company is working on ways to boost
the disk's capacity to 1 gigabyte and beyond while slimming the
engine's profile.</TE>
<TE>   Volk said the company has spent $125 million so far, the bulk of
it coming from venture capital firms and corporate investors. These
include photography powerhouses Eastman Kodak Co. and Olympus Optical
Co., chip maker Intel Corp., giant music retailer Trans World
Entertainment Corp., and Asian electronics conglomerates Toshiba and
Samsung.</TE>
<TE>   Also backing DataPlay is Universal Music Group, the world's
largest record company. DataPlay officials said that three of the
five major record companies--Universal, EMI and BMG--each pledged to
have 50 hit albums in DataPlay format, although Universal is expected
to have only 10 to 15 titles ready by May.</TE>
<TE>   The CD will be hard to replace, given the millions of disc players
installed in homes, cars and offices. But the music industry is eager
to supplant it with copy-protected media, which not only combat
piracy but also enable new business models.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Kenswil, president of Universal ELabs, said the CD makes it
difficult for the labels to sell packages of music with fewer
rights--for example, an album that could be played only on one
device, or for a set amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   "That forces the price of the CD to be very high in the first
place, and secondly eliminates the possibility of pricing things
lower for fewer rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Encryption Feature Has Fans and Foes</TE>
<TE>   Any kind of data can be stored on a DataPlay disk, but a
DataPlay-equipped music player will play only music files that have
been encrypted, Volk said. In other words, a DataPlay device can't
play MP3s unless they're wrapped in software that prevents them from
being copied or moved to other computers.</TE>
<TE>   The encryption features have cooled the enthusiasm of one early
backer, Sonicblue Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based consumer
electronics company.</TE>
<TE>   "They've sold their soul to Universal," said Andrew Wolfe,
Sonicblue's chief technical officer. "There are so many rules and
restrictions about what you can put on the disk and what you can't
put on the disk, it just doesn't fit into our infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   Samsung, Toshiba and San Diego-based E.Digital Corp., on the other
hand, all have announced plans for music players, cameras and
adapters that enable computers to read DataPlay disks. The first
DataPlay device, due April 15, is a $350 player from Evolution
Technologies Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., that's based on an E.Digital
design.</TE>
<TE>   Prices will be high initially, because the DataPlay engine costs
about $100, said Brad Deifer, chief executive of Evolution. By
contrast, supporting a CompactFlash memory card requires a connector
that costs less than 50 cents, said Nelson Chan of SanDisk Corp., a
leading manufacturer of flash memory products.</TE>
<TE>   Volk said the company's investors are committed to the format,
giving the firm plenty of time to establish the new medium. "I don't
think DataPlay's viability is an issue here," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even successful formats take years to win over the masses.
Although the proliferation of portable digital gear and the rising
concerns about piracy make DataPlay's timing auspicious, its
opportunity is passing quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Prices of flash memory chips and hard drives are plummeting while
their capacities double every year.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, a fully re-writable 512-MB CompactFlash card
will sell for about the same amount as a DataPlay disk and engine
cost today.</TE>
<TE>   The labels' support and the company's engineering breakthroughs
give DataPlay a significant head start in what some analysts see as a
race for the next great format. Said Jim Porter, an analyst for
Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., "If this gets done on
schedule, with perceived reliability and at the right cost, then
Steve Volk has a huge winner."</TE>

<HD>Korean Air Says It's on Safe Path to Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After being buffeted by severe safety lapses, the global economic
slump and the Sept. 11 crisis, Korean Air believes it's finally
heading into blue skies again.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea's flagship carrier is predicting a major rebound this
year, aided by a management shake-up, an overhaul of Korean Air's
safety practices and operating structure, a stout rebound in South
Korea's economy, the upcoming World Cup soccer championship in South
Korea and Japan, and burgeoning travel by the Chinese.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike many U.S. and foreign airlines, Korean Air also says that
its passenger traffic nearly has returned to pre-Sept. 11 levels and
that it expects a profit this year. It's forecasting earnings of
about $77 million on revenue of $4.6 billion, compared with a
$400-million loss in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "In less than six months we have fully recovered" from the travel
impact of the terrorist attacks, Korean Air Chairman Y.H. Cho said
during a visit to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Korean Air still faces the challenge of rebuilding its
reputation as a safe airline, which has been tarnished in recent
years by several fatal crashes and other incidents. The airline's
recovery took a big step forward two months ago, when the Federal
Aviation Administration lifted restrictions it had imposed against
South Korean airlines overall, thus effectively restoring Korean
Air's status as a safe carrier by U.S. standards.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA placed the restrictions--including a ban on expanding U.S.
service--on South Korean airlines because of safety concerns. (The
agency doesn't rate individual foreign carriers.) The curbs sparked
diplomatic and economic tension between the United States and South
Korea, a major U.S. ally and provider of U.S. imports.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Korean Air will be allowed to restore its
code-sharing pact with Delta Air Lines this spring in which they book
passengers on each other's flights, exchange frequent-flier miles and
thus extend their worldwide reach. Delta had suspended the alliance
in 1999 amid the mounting criticism of Korean Air's safety record.
The pact was restored Friday in Seoul, and the code-sharing is
expected to start again in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel very confident with respect to the changes that have been
made" at Korean Air, Delta Chairman Leo F. Mullin told analysts
recently. "We provided a lot of consulting help to Korean Air on
their safety program," he said, "and we're very pleased to be
resuming our code-share with them."</TE>
<TE>   The decisions by the FAA and Delta are crucial to Korean Air's
recovery insofar as they help restore confidence in the airline, said
Raymond Neidl, an analyst with investment firm ABN Amro in New York.
"Delta got firsthand knowledge of the situation, so Delta must
certainly be satisfied that they've got the job done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California also has a lot riding on Korean Air's
progress. Korean Air is one of the biggest foreign carriers, in terms
of passengers, serving Los Angeles International Airport. That
reflects the sizable Korean population in the region--186,000 in Los
Angeles County alone, according to the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   Korean Air also is the largest cargo shipper at LAX among foreign
carriers. The airline overall has 119 aircraft and 16,000 employees
handling nearly 400 flights a day to 82 cities in 30 countries.</TE>
<TE>   The airline's problems began mounting dramatically Aug. 6, 1997,
when a Korean Air 747 crashed on approach in Guam, killing 228 of the
254 people on board. The crash was the latest in a string of
incidents involving Korean Air and heightened criticism of the
airline's safety procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, only days after a Korean Air cargo jet taking off
from Shanghai crashed, Korean Air's president at the time said the
accidents were an embarrassment to the nation and demanded changes in
management. That led to Cho being named chairman and Yi-Taek Shim
becoming the carrier's president, with them sharing the chief
executive's role.</TE>
<TE>   Cho, a tall, broad-shouldered man who earned a master's degree in
business administration from USC, is the 52-year-old son of Korean
Air founder Choong Hoong Cho, who leads the Hanjin chaebol, an
ocean-shipping group that owns Korean Air. With Shim, a 30-year
veteran of Korean Air, the younger Cho has strived to reform the
carrier's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to shift Korean Air's emphasis from financial growth to
safety, the pair began a $200-million program that included buying
new crash-warning systems and other technology and hiring more
foreign pilots and U.S. safety experts. They also tightened
restrictions on flying in poor weather.</TE>
<TE>   But Y.H. Cho and Shim also had to clear another big hurdle: a
rigid hierarchy among Korean Air's pilots, rooted in Korean culture,
that created friction between the captains, who refused to listen to
complaints and concerns, and others in the cockpit. The chairman
hopes that hiring foreign pilots will open lines of communication
while broadening the pilot base.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean Air crash in Guam was partly due to the failure of the
plane's two other cockpit members to "effectively monitor and
cross-check the captain's" approach to the airport, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.</TE>
<TE>   Korean Air's need to instill more communication among its
employees, regardless of rank, unsettled the work force, Y.H. Cho
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I received a lot of complaints," he said. "But I told them, 'You
have to change.' And we're changing their mind-sets."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11 and the plunge in airline travel worldwide. In
one measure of the falloff, Korean Air's passenger count at LAX
tumbled 14% last year to 710,146, and its freight loads at the
airport fell 19% to 103,000 tons, according to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   But Y.H. Cho said that with Korean Air's traffic returning to
normal, its load factors, or percentage of available seats filled
with passengers, are running at a typical 70% to 75%. The carrier is
planning to add a third daily nonstop flight from LAX to Seoul in May
in time for the monthlong World Cup soccer matches that start May 31.
Korean Air expects the games to generate nearly $80million in
additional revenue for the airline this year. Yet Korean Air's
biggest boost could come from China, where an easing of travel
restrictions is helping spark new traffic. With Seoul squarely
between Beijing and Tokyo, Korean Air--with 51 flights a week to
China--estimates it will carry 1 million Chinese passengers in 2002,
double the number it carried three years ago.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Airport Reaps Slot Machine Windfall</HD>
<DH>Travel: Tightened security means passengers arrive early,
with some time and money to spare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Air travelers in and out of Las Vegas are arriving hours early these
days--and gambling more--at McCarran International Airport, where
slot machines sit side-by-side with baggage carousels and departure
gates.</LD>
<LD>   The result of tightened security after Sept. 11 has been a
windfall for the nation's seventh-largest airport as gambling revenue
and other concessions have taken off.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hurry up and wait," said Sandy Ortiz, 56, waiting in Las
Vegas for a flight to San Jose and sipping a cup of Starbuck's
coffee. Her husband gave in to a beckoning slot machine.</LD>
<TE>   McCarran is unique among major U.S. airports because it offers
slot machines in concourses and gate waiting areas. But its gains,
which have been about $500,000 in increased gambling revenue during
the fourth quarter, reflect a concession boomlet that analysts see as
travelers arrive earlier at airports to clear stricter security and
are left waiting for flights with reduced meal service.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying food because they're not going to get fed on
the airplane," said Sheldon Klapper, president of the Center for
Airport Management, a company in Portland that tracks business at 30
airports. "But a stronger motivation is they're just there and they
have to do something."</TE>
<TE>   In some airports, despite significant drops in passenger numbers,
concession sales have remained steady--indicating that after clearing
security, passengers are spending more than spare change in their
spare time.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously, where people would go out and have a latte, now
they're having lunch," said Bob Parker, spokesman for Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport in Washington state. "They've got more time."</TE>
<TE>   Not all airports are seeing an increase in concessions. At Logan
International Airport in Boston, retail and restaurant businesses
have suffered with stricter security and fewer passengers passing
through.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have time to shop. They're standing in security
lines," said Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Klapper said concessions at airports such as Los Angeles, San
Francisco and New York's John F. Kennedy generally have been hurt by
a drop in the number of overseas travelers. Other airports served by
bargain airlines catering to domestic vacationers are seeing
concession business take off as low fares draw people "past their
fears and onto the planes," Klapper said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they have their boarding pass in hand, people are looking
for amenities to relieve stress," Klapper said, citing increases in
fear of flying and an airport "hassle factor" since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Although 1.5 million fewer passengers passed through the Las Vegas
airport in the fourth quarter of 2001 compared with the year before,
McCarran raked in $8.5 million in slot revenue--$473,618 more than a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an hour's entertainment," said Bernie Rich, 59, a
Bloomingdale, Ill., resident who walked away with $4.70 after
plunking $10 into a slot machine while waiting for his aunt to
arrive. His wife and a cousin spent the hour cruising the shops of a
pre-security concourse.</TE>
<TE>   Increased security has meant mixed results for Kathy Hussey,
general manager at McCarran for Atlanta-based WH Smith Inc., a
bookseller and newsstand chain. "Lines, sometimes, are so long that
by the time people get through they have no time to shop," she said.
"Other times, people get here early, expecting long lines."</TE>
<TE>   But with other airports around the nation incurring greater
declines in passenger traffic and sales, Hussey said her group of 16
newsstands and bookstores vaulted from fourth to the top in sales
among 23 airports in North America.</TE>
<TE>   "It does seem like people are reading more--not only books, but
also newspapers and news magazines, because they're trying to keep up
with the news," Hussey said.</TE>

<HD>Major Fight Looms Over Options Accounting</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress and corporate America may soon reprise a major battle over
accounting practices for stock options.</LD>
<LD>   Among the far-reaching reforms proposed in the wake of the Enron
Corp. debacle, some legislators want to force companies to begin
recording the cost of stock options granted employees, or lose
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Companies now can choose simply to disclose the value of so-called
nonqualified stock options when they are issued to employees, rather
than officially charge that cost against earnings. Either way, a
company can take a tax deduction for the amount.</LD>
<TE>   A bill introduced in the Senate last week by Michigan Democrat
Carl Levin and Arizona Republican John McCain would require the stock
option tax deduction to be reflected as an expense on a company's
income statement, reducing reported profit.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, if a company doesn't officially report a stock
option expense, it can't take a deduction on its tax return.</TE>
<TE>   Levin, who tried unsuccessfully to change options accounting in
the late 1990s, said the bill would eliminate accounting abuses such
as those at the bankrupt Enron, which didn't reduce reported earnings
for options expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Stock options were a driving force behind management decisions at
Enron that focused on increasing Enron's stock price rather than the
solid growth of the company," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron paid no corporate income taxes in four out of the last five
years, mostly by using tax benefits from stock options, the
labor-funded Citizens for Tax Justice reported last month.</TE>
<TE>   But as in the 1990s, the Levin-McCain bill is likely to face
fierce opposition. The American Electronics Assn., a trade group
representing firms such as Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp., said
passage could make companies less willing to use options, making it
harder to attract and retain workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Many companies would find the tax and accounting regime of the
Levin-McCain bill so onerous that they would discontinue offering
options to all but the most senior executives," said William T.
Archey, the AEA's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The Levin-McCain bill also drew criticism from the president of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a trade
group. "Accounting standards should be set in the private sector,"
Barry Melancon said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would affect tax treatment of nonqualified stock options,
because proceeds from exercising those options are taxable. Employers
don't receive the deduction for granting another form of options,
known as incentive stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Other sponsors of the legislation include Sens. Peter Fitzgerald
(R-Ill.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald said the bill would change accounting standards that
may have enabled Enron to overstate earnings per share by as much as
11% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill does not reduce earnings. It reduces what companies are
reporting as earnings," Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also include trade associations such as the Software
Finance and Tax Executives Council, which represents Microsoft Corp.
and Oracle Corp. They contend the legislation would overturn
long-standing Financial Accounting Standards Board rules on stock
options. And they say that the bill would force companies to estimate
the future value of stock options and that this may overstate or
understate the value when employees finally exercise them.</TE>

<HD>Enron's Overseas Boondoggle</HD>
<DH>Probe: The bankrupt energy trader's grandiose, U.S-funded
projects, which sprouted in places no other firm would go, appear not
to have earned it a dime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES V. GRIMALDI</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With operations in 20 countries, Enron Corp. set out in the early
1990s to become an international energy trailblazer, with grandiose
projects and huge U.S. government-backed investments in places no
other company would go.</LD>
<LD>   Enron launched bold projects in poverty-ravaged countries such as
Nigeria and Nicaragua. It set up huge barges--with names like
Esperanza, Margarita and El Enron--in ports around the world to
generate power for energy-starved cities.</LD>
<LD>   Enron cut through a Brazilian tropical forest--ranked one of the
hemisphere's most endangered ecosystems--to lay a gas pipeline. It
broke ground on Poland's first privately owned power plant and braved
India's turbulent politics to build a $3-billion plant.</LD>
<TE>   After Enron went into bankruptcy protection, U.S.-backed lenders
and disappointed foreign governments are surveying the damage caused
by the company's international designs. As facts emerge about the
foreign ventures, it appears that Enron did not earn a dime from the
projects, but it used some of them in creative accounting schemes
that disguised the company's true financial picture, documents and
interviews show.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Overseas Private Investment Corp., which backed
many of the projects, moved to stem its $1-billion Enron exposure by
canceling $590 million in loans to the company, once one of its
largest clients. Enron had missed deadlines for OPIC requirements in
financing projects in Brazil, an OPIC spokesman said. OPIC's decision
shifted more of the burden for the troubled projects from the U.S.
government to Enron's creditors, lenders and partners.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   System Encouraged Executives to Gamble</TE>
<TE>   Like other parts of Enron's vast operation, its international
division was fueled by intense internal competition and huge
financial incentives. Executives pocketed multimillion-dollar bonuses
for signing international deals under a structure that based their
rewards on the long-term estimated value of projects rather than
their actual returns. The system encouraged executives to gamble
without regard to risk, said Louis Wells, a Harvard Business School
professor who has studied Enron's overseas investments.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's international investment totaled more than $7 billion,
including more than $3 billion in Latin America, $1 billion in India
and $2.9 billion to develop a British water-supply and
waste-treatment company.</TE>
<TE>   It enlisted U.S. ambassadors and secretaries of State, Commerce
and Energy to buttonhole foreign officials. Enron cultivated
international political connections, recruiting former government
officials and relatives of heads of state as investors and lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   In reports to investors, the company played down or obscured what
analysts and others saw as inevitable losses. But in an interview
with academic researchers nine months ago, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who
then was chief operating officer, conceded that Enron "had not earned
compensatory rates of return" on investments in overseas power
plants, waterworks and pipelines. Skilling said the projects had
fueled an "acrimonious debate" among executives about the wisdom of
its heavy foreign investments.</TE>
<TE>   An internal investigation released this month showed that two
foreign projects, in Brazil and Poland, were entangled in Enron's
off-the-books partnerships, accounting devices controlled by
then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow that shielded huge
debts from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed that Enron engaged in an unusual transaction to
add $65 million to the revenue of the Brazilian pipeline project
before it had even been completed. The Polish plant was briefly sold
to an insider partnership and sold back to Enron a few months later.
Those arrangements allowed Enron to present a more optimistic report
to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Other partnerships at the center of the Enron investigation also
were involved, an Enron spokesman said. The Whitewing partnership had
interests in the Trakya power plant in Turkey and Elektro, a power
distributor in Brazil. It also owned a controlling interest in
Promigas, a natural gas pipeline operator in Colombia, and the Sarlux
power plant in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Another partnership, called Ponderosa, had interests in the CEG,
CEGRIO and Gaspart gas-distribution companies in Brazil, the
Centragas distribution system in Colombia and the TGS gas
transportation company in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Supplied Billions for Enron Expansion</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has been a major backer of Enron's overseas
expansion. Since 1992, OPIC provided about $1.7billion for Enron's
foreign deals and promised $500million more for projects that didn't
go forward. The Export-Import Bank put about $700 million into
Enron's foreign ventures. Both agencies provide financing and
political-risk insurance for foreign projects undertaken by U.S.
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Enron already has filed a $200-million claim with OPIC in
connection with its troubled power plant in Dabhol, India, which is
up for sale but considered unlikely to recover Enron's full
investment.</TE>
<TE>   OPIC spokesman Larry Spinelli said Enron was notified Wednesday
that the agency would not proceed with processing $590 million in
loans. Asked if they could be resurrected as Enron attempts to
restructure under bankruptcy protection, Spinelli said, "Not under
these circumstances. This is over now." Enron spokesmen declined to
discuss the foreign projects in detail but acknowledged trouble at
certain projects.</TE>
<TE>   "There might have been some where we paid too much," Enron
spokesman John Ambler said. "And there are others where there have
been operational difficulties. But a large number of them are still
good."</TE>

<HD>Ford's Pedal Adjusters Prompt Legal Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Offered for just three years, power adjusters for gas and brake
pedals have become Ford Motor Co.'s best-selling optional feature.</LD>
<LD>   Ford markets the adjusters as a convenience that allows drivers to
sit farther from the steering wheel while still reaching the pedals.
The feature has been popular with consumers of all sizes, and other
auto makers are beginning to offer adjusters.</LD>
<LD>   But a lawsuit against Ford contends the adjusters are not just for
comfort--they can save shorter drivers from injuries in a crash by
keeping them farther back from the steering wheel air bag, which can
inflate at speeds of up to 200 mph.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, which goes to trial Tuesday in Louisville, Ky., claims
Ford was negligent because it knew about adjusters' safety potential
long before it started offering the option.</TE>
<TE>   ''There was a major risk that was known in the automobile industry
to short-statured female drivers from the deployment of air bags, and
this particular invention eased that risk,'' said attorney Ron
Hillerich, representing the family of a woman who died when an air
bag deployed.</TE>
<TE>   Ford rejects the claim. It acknowledges the safety benefit but
said it has not tried to market the adjusters that way.</TE>
<TE>   ''Even before you had these adjustable pedals, you could purchase
pedal extenders,'' Ford spokeswoman Sara Tatchio said. "This isn't a
new concept, but a more convenient way of delivering it.''</TE>
<TE>   If the company were to promote the adjusters as helping prevent
air bag injuries, Ford officials fear it could open the auto maker to
more lawsuits if a driver is hurt or killed by an air bag while using
the adjustable pedals.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusters can move the pedals up to 3 inches closer to a driver.
They are deployed by pressing buttons next to the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, at least 68 drivers have been killed by air bags,
including 21 who were wearing seat belts, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Ford introduced the adjusters in the 1999 models of its Explorer
and Lincoln Navigator sport-utility vehicles and has expanded the
option to other models. Sales range from 43% of buyers on F-series
trucks and Taurus cars to 25% on the Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Other manufacturers are getting in on the market. DaimlerChrysler
offers the adjusters on its newest minivans and the 2002 Dodge Ram
and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Toyota hopes to introduce the adjusters on
the 2003 Camry.</TE>
<TE>   The government recommends drivers maintain at least 10 inches
between their chest and the air bag. But a study by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety showed that as many as 5% of female
drivers sit closer.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Kratzke, NHTSA's associate administrator for safety
performance standards, said adjusters are an important safety benefit
even if the auto makers do not market them that way.</TE>
<TE>   He said the agency is studying how to get the message out to
consumers.</TE>

<HD>Investors to Weigh Accounting, Economics</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the stock market resumes trading Tuesday, so will Wall Street's
emotional tug-of-war between improving fundamentals in the economy
and growing fears about the accuracy of corporate accounting.</LD>
<LD>   The economic data in recent weeks have largely been pointing to a
rebound in business activity that could revive corporate earnings by
the second half of this year. But the good news has been overshadowed
by mounting revelations of questionable, if not downright fraudulent,
accounting at some major companies in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, however, blue-chip stock indexes managed to post gains,
despite more worrisome headlines about dicey accounting practices,
particularly in the telecom sector.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 1.1% on Friday but still rose
0.7% for the week, after two straight weekly declines.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials ended Friday at 9,903.04, off 1% for the day
but still up 1.6% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   The tech- and telecom-dominated Nasdaq composite, however, fell
2.1% on Friday and 0.8% for the week--the third straight weekly
decline. Nasdaq is down 7.4% this year, after plunging 21% last year
and 39% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the economic reports due this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on housing starts
in January.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the consumer price index for January will be
released. Analysts predict the CPI will post a rise of 0.2% for the
month.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Conference Board will issue its index of leading
economic indicators for January.</TE>
<TE>   * Also Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on the U.S.
trade balance for December.</TE>
<TE>   Though fourth-quarter-earnings reporting season is nearly
complete, a few major companies will report this week. Tuesday,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, and Medtronic
Inc., the world's largest medical device company, are expected to
announce quarterly results.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies expected to report this week include Aetna Inc.
and California utility giant PG&amp;E Corp., whose Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. unit filed for bankruptcy last April.</TE>

<HD>Canada, U.S. to Meet on Lumber Dispute</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Canadian and U.S. officials are scheduled to meet in Ottawa on
Tuesday in another attempt to settle their 10-month dispute over
softwood lumber shipments, a spokesman for the Canadian Trade
Department said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick is sending his deputy,
Peter Allgeier, while Canadian Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew told
his No. 1 official, Deputy Minister Len Edwards, to cancel plans to
join Pettigrew on a trade mission in Russia and Germany, Canadian
government spokesman Andre Lemay said.</LD>
<LD>   Pettigrew canceled meetings with U.S. officials a week ago after
they didn't come up with a counteroffer to a three-week-old Canadian
proposal to end the row. The U.S. hit Canadian shipments of lumber
with duties of as much as 38.5% last year, charging that sawmills are
subsidized by Canadian provinces. Canada denies the accusation.</LD>
<TE>   ''The U.S. is now prepared to re-energize the softwood talks,''
Lemay said. ''The U.S. is bringing proposals to the table.''</TE>
<TE>   Canada exported $7.5 billion worth of lumber to the U.S. last
year, according to government figures.</TE>

<HD>Sponsors Fight 401(k) Plan Limits</HD>
<DH>Retirement: Employers and trade groups are dispatching
lobbyists to try to restrict legislation for reform of the investment
vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Small businesses, big corporations and trade associations
are mobilizing for an all-out lobbying effort to head off proposed
restrictions on how they administer employee retirement programs in
the post Enron era.</LD>
<LD>   Employers fear that Congress, in its zeal to respond to Enron's
implosion, will limit their ability to use tax-advantaged 401(k)
plans to promote--and in some cases compel--employee ownership of
company stock.</LD>
<LD>   "This is gigantic," said James Delaplane, vice president for
retirement policy at the American Benefits Council in Washington.
"This is very, very significant for the benefit community, for the
employer community, for the plan sponsor community, because a number
of the things on the table are very fundamental changes."</LD>
<TE>   Critics say changes are needed to avert future disasters  like the
collapse of Enron, which wiped out the retirement savings of many of
the company's investors. Millions of Americans have a portion of
their 401(k) accounts tied up in company stock, and their ability to
switch to other investments often is restricted. They stand to lose
not only their jobs if the firm fails, but their nest eggs too.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the system say companies that compel employee stock
ownership do so because it makes workers more loyal, productive and
profit-conscious. But there are other benefits as well: Contributing
company stock instead of cash to retirement accounts boosts cash
flow, reduces taxes and provides companies some shelter from stock
price swings and takeover attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are using their contributions to employees' 401(k)s as
a strategy to manipulate the value of their stock," said University
of Notre Dame economist Teresa Ghilarducci. "That's become a key
tactic in keeping their share prices stable. They're using the
nation's pension system for purposes it was never intended."</TE>
<TE>   The clamor on Capitol Hill reflects a broader debate over a shift
in the ground rules governing worker retirement in America.
Traditional "defined benefit" pension plans that obligate employers
to provide a guaranteed level of benefits are gradually being
supplanted by "defined contribution" plans that transfer
decision-making to employees.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have flocked to 401(k)s because they tend to cost less
than traditional pension plans and relieve employers of
responsibility for future shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got $2 trillion in these plans," said Rep. George Miller
(D-Martinez). "You've got people within the financial and accounting
institutions who are incredibly conflicted. You've got the whole idea
that Americans are going to have to provide more and more for their
own retirement. This is high stakes."</TE>
<TE>   Retirement plan sponsors, which include companies, unions and
pension funds that have 401(k)s for their members or employees, and
the associations that represent them are dispatching lobbyists to the
House and Senate to attempt to limit the scope of reform measures.</TE>
<TE>   The big players have banded together in an ad hoc coalition called
the Committee on Employee Retirement Benefits. More than 60 industry
and professional organizations, from the National Assn. of
Manufacturers to the American Society of Pension Actuaries, are
urging lawmakers to proceed with caution before tinkering with the
retirement accounts of 42 million Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be difficult to maintain the status quo. President
Bush is among those advocating changes in response to Enron's
collapse, which obliterated more than $1 billion in employee
retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of Enron's 401(k) plan assets consisted of company
stock, which lost virtually all of its value as the company's
financial problems and accounting irregularities became known.</TE>
<TE>   Most financial planners say employees should invest no more than
10% of their retirement savings in their own companies.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen pension reform measures are under consideration
in Congress. But the one that scares plan sponsors the most is a bill
sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.)
that would allow employees to invest no more than 20% of their 401(k)
funds in shares issued by their employers.</TE>
<TE>   Plan sponsors argue that the government has no business telling
company employees how they should invest their money. But Boxer and
other advocates of a cap on company stock holdings say there is a
legitimate public interest at stake: The tax deduction granted to
employers for their retirement plan contributions reduces federal
revenue by about $90 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   It's the government's biggest tax subsidy, more costly than the
deductions allowed for mortgage interest or employee health
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxpayers are subsidizing these plans by tens of billions of
dollars by giving tax breaks to employers," Boxer said. "Because the
federal government is giving all these wonderful incentives, I think
it's very, very appropriate to have rules that protect these plans."</TE>
<TE>   Plan sponsors warn that caps would require constant monitoring of
account balances and mandatory sales of company stock if the price
appreciated substantially. They say it would punish employees for
having picked a winner and force them to subordinate their investment
objectives to those of the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not arguing that no change is necessary, but the issue of
caps just goes the wrong way," said Mark Ugoretz, president of the
ERISA Industry Committee, which represents big corporate employers.
"It forces the employee to sell or prevents the employee from buying
the stock when it's increasing in value."</TE>
<TE>   Another reform proposal disliked by many plan sponsors would
affect employers that  contribute</TE>
<TE>   company stock instead of cash to workers' 401(k) accounts. In some
cases, they require employees to hold the shares for years, making it
difficult to diversify--or bail out if problems arise.</TE>
<TE>   Of the estimated $1 billion in retirement savings lost by Enron
employees, about $100 million came from company stock they were
prohibited from selling until age 50.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's reform plan would allow participants to sell
their company-contributed stock after three years. Miller is
sponsoring legislation that would reduce the waiting period to a
year. The Boxer-Corzine bill would let workers diversify after 90
days.</TE>
<TE>   Plan sponsors and their advocates are concerned about other
proposed reforms, such as the use of outside investment advisors to
counsel employees, restrictions on "blackout" periods--when employees
are barred from selling stock--and expanded financial liability for
plan administrators.</TE>
<TE>   They are asking Congress to put off consideration of
Enron-inspired reforms until more is known about the causes of the
company's failure and whether any of the 401(k) changes under
consideration would have prevented the loss of employee retirement
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stuff being put on the table that has nothing to
do with company stock," said David Wray, president of the
Chicago-based Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America. "People who
have other agendas are starting to take advantage of this."</TE>

<HD>On Evaluations, Know What You Are Signing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My employer insists that employees sign their evaluations.
I feel that by signing the form I am acknowledging any critical
remarks.</LD>
<LD>   Is an employee obligated to sign this document? If so, would it be
a good idea to write a small disclaimer if you don't agree?</LD>
<LD>   --A.V., El Monte</LD>
<TE>   Answer: If you simply are acknowledging that you have received
your evaluation by signing the document, go ahead and sign it. By
refusing to sign, employees may be considered insubordinate,
jeopardizing their job security.</TE>
<TE>   However, if it is unclear what you are acknowledging when you sign
a document, don't sign it until you have clarified what you are
signing.</TE>
<TE>   If the document is something illegal, such as a noncompetitive
agreement, courts have protected employees who were fired because
they refused to sign such documents.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not sure of the effects of signing, you could write
above your signature "acknowledging receipt only."</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that there are some advantages to signing documents.
Not only does it show cooperation, but it gives you a right to a copy
of the document at any time in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The law says you have a right to a copy of anything you have
signed, but not necessarily copies of documents that you did not
sign.</TE>

<TE>   Paycheck Must Arrive Within Set Time Period</TE>
<TE>   Q: Our company decided to mail our paychecks to our houses instead
of delivering them at work.</TE>
<TE>   With Friday as the scheduled payday, many of us do not get our pay
stubs until Monday or Tuesday the following week. For those of us
with direct deposit, it is a major nuisance. For the people who do
not have direct deposit, it must be a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Are there any rules requiring a company to provide its employees
with their pay information in a timely manner?</TE>
<TE>   --A.P., Hawthorne</TE>
<TE>   A: Although no California rules directly address the legality of
mailing paychecks and direct-deposit confirmation to employees, some
general requirements might apply to the situation you describe.</TE>
<TE>   Every employer, for example, must post a notice specifying its
regular paydays and the time and place of payment. And employees who
are paid weekly, biweekly or semimonthly must be paid within seven
calendar days of the close of each payroll period.</TE>
<TE>   Employees who receive paychecks through the mail would argue that
your employer is not complying with the state's wage-payment
requirements if they are not receiving their checks on the day and in
the manner described in the notice that your employer is required to
post.</TE>
<TE>   Your employer could avoid this problem, however, by posting a new
notice describing its procedures of paying by mail.</TE>
<TE>   If employees do not receive their paychecks within seven days
after the appropriate payroll period, they would have a stronger
argument that their employer violated state requirements for paying
wages.</TE>
<TE>   For employees like you who have direct deposit, the argument that
your employer's mailing procedure violates the requirements would be
less convincing. You presumably still are receiving your wages in a
timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   However, you might assert that your employer's wage payments are
not complete until you receive both the money you have earned and the
corresponding pay stub information.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, your employer should carefully consider its
payment-by-mail practices because the company may be subjecting
itself to substantial civil penalties if the state Division of Labor
Standards Enforcement concludes that these procedures do not meet all
of California's wage payment rules.</TE>

<TE>   Vision Disclosure May Not Be Necessary</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am blind in one eye, but it's not apparent and doesn't affect
my normal work. Am I required to disclose this in a job interview or
during the employment process?</TE>
<TE>   P.D., North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   A: Not unless your work is safety-sensitive and you are asked
about vision impairment during a pre-employment physical or on some
other occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Certain jobs, such as pilot or truck driver, carry minimum vision
standards. But if you do not work in such a job, there is no
requirement that you disclose your condition.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. will unveil new microprocessors, including one for data
networking equipment, this month at its conference for software and
hardware developers.</LD>
<LD>   The network processor and a related semiconductor that directs
information in and out of the guts of networking gear will be based
on Intel's XScale architecture, which it is pushing as a standard in
both the wireless and networking industries, Intel spokeswoman
Christine Chartier said.</LD>
<LD>   At the Intel Developer Forum, starting Feb. 25 in San Francisco,
the company will announce new Xeon processors that are the brains of
powerful server computers that serve up Web pages and comprise
computer networks.</LD>
<TE>   Executives also will tout Intel's forthcoming McKinley processor,
which is scheduled to go on the market by midyear.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley is the successor of the Itanium processor, Intel's first
chip that crunches data in chunks of 64 bits, compared with the 32
bits for Intel's Pentium and Xeon chips.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palm Inc.'s share of the hand-held computer market tumbled in 2001
but the company remained dominant, withstanding gains by rivals
Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard, a study found.</LD>
<LD>   Research firm Dataquest said last week that Palm's slice of the
global market for personal digital assistants, the popular
pocket-sized information-management tools, fell to 38.6% in 2001 from
50.4% in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Palm shipped 5.1 million units, more than three times the total of
its nearest competitor. But shipments in 2001 were off from
5.6million in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a difficult year for Palm," Gartner Dataquest analyst Todd
Kort said. "But considering that they owned the market for several
years and that serious competition has finally arrived, it is not a
surprise that they would be losing some 10 points in market share
from one year to the next."</TE>

<HD>Game Console Prices Expected to Fall</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Experts say Sony, Microsoft could begin
reductions in May to compete with Nintendo's GameCube.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An intense price war is expected this year between the three major
game console makers that would slash prices by up to a third and
increase already cutthroat competition in the video game industry,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Although Sony Computer Entertainment of America, Microsoft Corp.
and Nintendo Co. would not comment on plans to cut prices of their
consoles this year, many industry analysts and top game company
executives are expecting such a move as early as May and certainly
before the holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   THQ Inc. Chief Executive Brian Farrell last week even staked his
2002 business forecast on a one-third drop in console prices.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd say it's extremely likely in 2002" that prices will drop,
said P.J. McNealy, senior analyst at Gartner Inc., a market research
firm in San Jose. "That's been the historical pattern in this
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 are priced at $299, but
many in the industry speculate that their prices will drop to match
Nintendo's GameCube, which is selling for $199.</TE>
<TE>   Though a price cut would be good for consumers, it would be even
better for companies that make games for these consoles. Lower prices
spur sales of consoles, which in turn create more customers for
software companies.</TE>
<TE>   For hardware makers, the move can make sense because they
generally make little if any money selling boxes. The real money for
Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo is in royalty payments made by software
companies for each game sold.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, both sides stand to gain by having as many consoles in as
many homes as possible, a strategy often referred to as the "razors
and blades" model.</TE>
<TE>   "You give away the razors to make money on the blades," said Larry
Probst, chief executive of Electronic Arts Inc., the world's largest
independent publisher of video games.</TE>
<TE>   Activision Inc. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick anticipates that a
price cut could come this fall. Others believe reductions could be
announced in May at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hardware manufacturers must weigh a number of factors in timing a
price cut: the pace of sales at current prices, prices of rival
consoles, market share of competitors and the cost of making the
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Each Xbox, for example, costs Microsoft more than $400 to make and
retails for $299. The cash-rich Redmond., Wash., company has been
willing to swallow the difference to sell as many boxes as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, manufacturing costs will decline as prices for parts
fall and big-ticket expenses are spread over larger console volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Sony, which came out with its PS2 in 2000, has a two-year head
start over its rivals in trimming expenses.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, most industry observers are expecting Sony to
strike first with a price cut, forcing Microsoft to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Sony has indicated that it is now making decent profits on the
hardware, which suggests they're in a better position to cut their
price," said Shawn Milne, analyst with SoundView Technology Group in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Price, game industry analyst with International Development
Group, a market research and consulting firm in San Francisco, said
Sony cut the price of its original PlayStation in 1996, a year after
it launched the console.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, they've been able to maintain the higher price for
much longer," Price said. "If they wait until the fall to make a
move, that would mean hanging on to the higher price for nearly two
years."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to timing, the companies must decide how steep their
first round of price cuts should be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that there will be an interim price cut to $249
this summer," analyst McNealy said. "That way, they have the
flexibility to make the call to go down to $199 if they feel more
heat during the second half of the year."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, however, a drop from $299 to $249 hasn't spurred many
consumers to buy consoles.</TE>
<TE>   "The magic price points are $199 and $99," Probst said. "That's
where you see the big bumps in sales."</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, the news gets better. Lower hardware prices
generally usher in lower software prices. Premier titles sell for
around $50 each.</TE>
<TE>   But as consoles creep toward $99, a low point reached by the
previous generation of game consoles, a $50 price tag for software
becomes more difficult to justify, Probst said. As a result, some
executives expect top software prices to drop to $39 this year or
next.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of years that a new console is out, software
prices are around $49.95," Probst said. "In year three, it gets down
to $39.95. And by year five, prices drop to $29.95."</TE>
<TE>   For some, console price drops can't happen soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner the better, and the lower the better, as far as we're
concerned," Probst said.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Is Doing Weddings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not Tiffany's, but Amazon.com's new wedding registry may have
its own cachet for couples who want a DVD player instead of a duvet.</LD>
<LD>   The registry, which launched last week, is the online retailer's
latest strategy to steal customers from bricks-and-mortar stores.</LD>
<LD>   Though several traditional retailers, such as Macy's and
Williams-Sonoma, already have online wedding registries, Amazon is
promoting its registry as an alternative for couples who already have
the basics and don't want another set of china.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not intending to launch something that's going to compete
with that tradition," said Jeff Blackburn, general manager of product
development for Amazon's wedding registry.</TE>
<TE>   The registry could be lucrative for the company, as each
individual registry could generate several thousand dollars, said
Lauren Freedman, president of the e-tailing group.</TE>
<TE>   It "sets a different expectation" than individual book or DVD
purchases, Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Amazon may have some difficulty going up against
conventionalstores, where couples can examine products before adding
them to their list and placing them online. Couples registering at
Amazon also will have to deal with the hassle of shipping unwanted
wedding presents rather than simply returning them to the store,
Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   If "the bride and groom has to repackage crystal, it's kind of a
pain," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon's wedding registry consists of 12 categories, ranging from
housewares to home improvement to home entertainment. Couples can
register for anything on the site, however, including millions of
books.</TE>
<TE>   Once a couple have saved their registry on the site, friends and
family can view the registry online and purchase gifts directly from
Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   Since Amazon introduced its all-occasion "wish list" registry in
October 1999 and its baby registry in May, about 6 million registries
have been created, although the company would not disclose how many
purchases have been made through them.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of bricks-and-mortar retailers offer online wish lists
or gift registries, but they have been slow to gain popularity, said
Rob Leathern, an analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix. Before the
holiday season, only 26% of online buyers had viewed, created or
purchased an item from an online registry, according to the Internet
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   As retailers improve their registry software and consumers become
more comfortable sharing their wish lists, those numbers should
increase, Leathern said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that can only grow over time," he said.</TE>

<HD>Machinists Union Sees Progress  in United Talks</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Agreement on a new contract for mechanics and
cleaners would ward off a looming strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the second-largest carrier, and its
machinists union are making progress on a new contract for 12,800
mechanics and cleaners as a Wednesday strike deadline looms, the
union said.</LD>
<LD>   The union told members in a notice Saturday that talks have
touched on all remaining issues since resuming Friday. Negotiators
are meeting at an undisclosed site in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems to be going in the right direction," said Tom Reardon,
an assistant general chairman for the machinists. "Right now, it's a
game of brinkmanship, who's going to blink first."</LD>
<TE>   The company has declined to comment on the status of talks.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement would ward off a strike at United, which had a record
$2.1-billion loss last year as travel demand fell because of the
recession and the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   UAL Chairman and Chief Executive John Creighton has said the
company will need several billion dollars of concessions from labor
groups during the next few years to stem losses.</TE>
<TE>   United told employees last week that it hired a bankruptcy
attorney to provide guidance in the event of a strike, Reardon said,
citing a taped United message and calling it a "negotiating ploy."</TE>
<TE>   A walkout may push the carrier into a Chapter 11 filing, some
analysts have said. Ticket reservations already have dropped for next
week because of the strike threat, the company has said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been in negotiations since December 1999 and
initially had sought an agreement by July 2000, when the contract
became open for changes. President Bush appointed an emergency board
in December to postpone a strike for 60 days and review the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 13 the workers rejected the tentative contract that the
panel proposed. That agreement would have given the most senior
mechanics at the Chicago-based carrier a 37% pay increase this year
to $35.14 an hour, with an additional 3.9% next year and 2.8% in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some workers opposed the proposal because of a provision that they
agree to any wage concessions the company might reach with other
employees in the next six months and another provision that delayed
starting payment of retroactive wages until next year.</TE>

<HD>In-Air Net Has Takeoff Woes</HD>
<DH>Internet: Travel industry downturn has prompted some
airlines to bail out of plans for offering high-speed access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CONLON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Giving passengers the means to fire off e-mail messages and surf the
Internet from airline seats 35,000 feet above the ground is still a
bright idea on the business travel horizon.</LD>
<LD>   But the harsh travel industry reality after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the economic climate may have slowed the technology's
arrival for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   One company that hoped to wire airline cabins for e-mail and
Internet access has folded, three big carriers have pulled out of
another project as investors, and a third firm is still in the
testing stage.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not going forward at this time," said Todd Burke, a
spokesman for American Airlines. "We pretty much agreed after Sept.
11 that it is something we will consider but it is not a high
priority for us."</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking of Connexion, a joint venture the AMR-owned
airline entered into with Boeing Co., UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and
Delta Air Lines.</TE>
<TE>   The three U.S.-based airlines have dropped out as investors. A
spokesman for Connexion said they may return as customers at some
point, and a prototype soon will be in the air on Lufthansa.
Seventeen carriers are in discussions with the venture, the spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Boeing project is a broadband satellite-based service that
would provide high-speed Internet and intranet access as well as
television and e-mail in real time to airline passengers.</TE>
<TE>   But it's impossible to predict when the economic climate and other
concerns will free up the airlines to go after such technology in
wholesale fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at connectivity options," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   One of those options in American's case apparently will not be the
seat-back telephone. American is removing the devices from its
domestic fleet because, Burke said, passengers were making an average
of only three calls a day per aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Seat-back phones, though equipped with data ports, never have been
popular for Internet access because of the hefty connection and
per-minute charges involved.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest already has removed its seat-back phones.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the carriers said customers were using their own
cellular phones while the planes were on the ground and passing on
the option of making a call in the air.</TE>
<TE>   American says it will keep a satellite-based telephone system on
its longest-range aircraft--Boeing 777s and 767-300s. Those phones
are equipped with data ports for passengers willing to pay the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, the economic downturn that battered business travel forced
another player out of the airline Internet field.</TE>
<TE>   In-Flight Network, a joint venture of Rockwell Collins Inc. and
News Corp., had planned to offer a broadband service using satellites
and technology from Qualcomm Inc. and Globalstar Telecommunications.
But poor business conditions ended that effort.</TE>
<TE>   The third player in the field is Seattle-based Tenzing
Communications, which says it has tested systems operating on board
20 aircraft of Cathay Pacific and Brazil's Varig and is talking with
two or three other carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Tenzing recently completed a test with Air Canada and says Cathay
Pacific hopes to roll out the system commercially in midyear.</TE>
<TE>   Tenzing's system is not true real-time connectivity. Passengers
can access a server on the plane that intermittently sends and
receives bursts of data, refreshing cached news and securities
quotes, for example, or sending and receiving e-mail.</TE>

<LD>Forget Web surfing--channel surfing may be the up-and-coming computer
sport.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous products are taking advantage of increasingly fast
computers and vast hard drives to turn personal computers into
television sets and video recorders.</LD>
<LD>   With a combination PC TV, you can have CNBC (or "All My Children")
playing in a window as you work (or play solitaire). With some
products, you can pause live TV and record shows on your hard
drive--much as you can with TiVo and ReplayTV personal video
recorders.</LD>
<TE>   A PC TV is ideal for businesspeople who want to keep an eye on the
news (or the soaps) from their cubicles, and it makes space-saving
sense for college dorm rooms.</TE>
<TE>   But if you're interested in recording TV shows, be forewarned: The
intersection of television and personal computers is still a
construction zone. No TV software I tested was as friendly and
foolproof as a TiVo or ReplayTV box. If you simply want the joys of
pausing live TV and skipping commercials, buy one of those devices
instead of trying to coerce your PC into acting like one.</TE>
<TE>   The first step in turning a computer into a television is to add
TV tuner hardware. Several companies sell TV tuner cards that install
in a PC's expansion slot, including ATI Technologies Inc., Hauppauge
Digital Inc., Pinnacle Systems Inc., Matrox Electronic Systems and
Avermedia Technologies Inc. Some companies also sell external tuners
that connect to a PC's Universal Serial Bus port and work with
laptops.</TE>
<TE>   I tested a high-end card--ATI Technologies' Windows-only Radeon
8500DV. This $399 card combines a TV tuner, fast video display
circuitry and FireWire jacks to which you can connect a digital
camcorder or other FireWire device. ATI's $199 Radeon 7500 provides
similar TV features but lacks FireWire.</TE>
<TE>   Both cards include software that lets you tune in to TV
broadcasts, pause live TV, record shows on your hard drive and
display closed captions.</TE>
<TE>   The cards also access an online program guide that displays local
listings and lets you select shows for recording.</TE>
<TE>   Both ATI cards include remote controls that let you control TV
functions and launch your Web browser. The remotes use wireless radio
links so you can change the channel from the living room even if your
PC TV is in the den.</TE>
<TE>   ATI's TV software takes advantage of closed captions in a clever
way. You can have the software save the caption text on your hard
drive, complete with occasional freeze-frame video images, to create
an illustrated transcript of a TV show. Try that with your VCR.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with the ATI system is that there is no easy way to
watch your recorded programs on another computer. You can transfer
video files over a network, but with some shows that could take
hours, given the size of the files.</TE>
<TE>   The solution is to install a nifty piece of software from
SnapStream Media called SnapStream PVS. This $50 Windows program
takes a video file and streams it, bit by bit, to any computer on a
network.</TE>
<TE>   It works with most TV tuner hardware. SnapStream also sells
tuner-and-software bundles for as little as $89.</TE>
<TE>   Like ATI's software, SnapStream lets you record programs on your
hard drive. But SnapStream PVS also sports a built-in server that
lets you watch recorded programs from any PC or Mac running
Microsoft's Windows Media Player software. I recorded some shows on
my Windows XP machine and then watched them in a different room using
my Apple PowerBook, which is connected via a wireless network.</TE>
<TE>   I was also able to watch recorded shows over the Net while away
from home. It was dazzlingly cool, even if the Internet video was a
bit grainy and jerky.</TE>
<TE>   TV features are not as extensive on the Macintosh. Several
companies, including ATI and Eskape Labs, sell USB-based external TV
tuners. But none includes personal video recorder software, and none
works under the new Mac OS X.</TE>
<TE>   The Mac may be a major force in TV production, but for desktop
couch potatoes, Windows is where the action is.</TE>

<HD>Banking on Slate</HD>
<DH>Kinsley may be leaving, but he wants it to succeed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael E. Kinsley was one of the first big-name journalists to
immerse himself in the online world. In 1996, he founded the online
news and feature magazine Slate (www.slate.com), financed by
Microsoft Corp.'s deep pockets.</LD>
<LD>   Several Web magazines have folded in the last couple of years, but
Kinsley said that Slate, which last month had 2.8 million visitors,
according to Jupiter Media Metrix, is close to breaking even without
undergoing major cutbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Slate was originally envisioned as a paid site, and in 1998 began
charging $19.95 a year for full access. Only a year later it went
back to being free, with its sole income from advertising.</LD>
<TE>   This month, a few weeks after he disclosed in a Time magazine
essay that he had Parkinson's disease, Kinsley told the Slate staff
via e-mail that he was stepping down as editor. "I feel I need a
change, and I think Slate could use a change as well," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He still will write his weekly column for the site and continue as
a contributing writer at Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Before starting the online venture, Kinsley was best known as
co-host of CNN's "Crossfire" on which he regularly tangled,
ideologically, with Pat Buchanan. In print magazines, he was twice
editor of the New Republic and for 11 years wrote its flagship "TRB
from Washington" column.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You've said that one of your main goals with Slate was
to become profitable. Why, with Microsoft's backing, was that so
important?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Because in the long run I think it's the best guarantee of
editorial independence. We want to show that the Internet serves
freedom of speech in an important way by making it easier for a
publication to become self-sustaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: But no publications on the scale of Slate have ever broken even
and many have died.</TE>
<TE>   A: No one has found quite the right business model or gotten one
to work except for those marketing sex or greed, and even greed has
not really done it. What form it will take in terms of advertising
and subscription fees is not quite obvious yet, but something is
going to work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You tried running Slate as a paid site.</TE>
<TE>   A: Someone had to try it and we jumped first. We got about 30,000
subscribers, which was not bad, but at the same time we had 400,000
visiting the free part of our site. It just seemed that selling
advertising with 400,000 visitors--now almost 3 million--was a better
business model than trying to squeeze 19 bucks out of 100,000
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, when we went to a paid model, it was still a time when there
was a big thing about information wanting to be free. That has died
down. Just because we were not a success doesn't mean someone won't
figure out how to do it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: The Wall Street Journal seems to have success with a paid site.</TE>
<TE>   A: They have greed on their side. Actually, they do a great job.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mystery to me that the micro-payments thing [whereby a user
pays per pages read] has not happened. There are all sorts of times I
would pay a buck for something on the Web, but I think the problem is
that you have to fill out long forms to do that. I'm willing to pay
the buck, but I don't feel like going through all that, so I move on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did your ideas about online content change since you started
Slate?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh yes. I came out here thinking that we would produce a kind
of magazine that people would download once a week, print out and
read like the New Yorker or Newsweek.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we actually went online we were posting a great hunk
of stuff on Friday morning, then adding other stuff three or four
days a week. We thought that was quite cool.</TE>
<TE>   But the whole idea of a site is that it can be constantly renewed
and updated. Now we refresh the content probably 12 times a day.</TE>
<TE>   We are still on a weekly cycle on some things, like my column. I
do think there is something natural about it. And we do have some
pretty cool options for printing material out, but we don't market it
very well.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you still believe Slate will become profitable?</TE>
<TE>   A: The gap has been closing every year. I know everyone says this,
but I think Slate will break even next year, fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: That's still important even though you're not editor?</TE>
<TE>   A: My reputation is still on the line. This thing is not a success
if it does not last beyond me.</TE>

<HD>'Homes Sweat Homes' for Families</HD>
<DH>Housing: Three Costa Mesa residences, built by Habitat for
Humanity, complete a dream for their new owners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The landscaping hasn't been completed, some fixtures still have to be
installed and the families won't move in for another two weeks, but
the three Habitat for Humanity houses on Del Mar Avenue in Costa Mesa
are already homes.</LD>
<LD>   The "sweat equity" the three families have invested by helping to
build their homes means they know the structures intimately.</LD>
<LD>   At a dedication ceremony Sunday, Dan Samuelson, a single father of
four, said he and his children have waited about five years for their
house. Working on the four-bedroom home, meeting volunteers and "a
lot of people who are involved that you're not aware of," has made
the experience overwhelming. And the fact that it's all his family's,
he said, makes it all the more meaningful.</LD>
<TE>   "I get my own room," said his teenage daughter, Betsi. "I want it
blue."</TE>
<TE>   Habitat for Humanity of Orange County, part of the nationwide
nonprofit group working to eliminate substandard housing and
homelessness, has built 90 homes in Orange County since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The Costa Mesa site includes the first Orange County Habitat home
built by a volunteer crew composed primarily of women, known by the
group as a "Women Build" project. A second "Women Build" home is
planned for Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Habitat for Humanity depends on donations of land, professional
services, funding, building materials and skilled and unskilled
volunteer labor to build the homes.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa's Redevelopment Agency provided funding for the land,
permits and public improvements, said Allan L. Roeder, city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Roeder did more than help the organization as a city official.
"I'm also a neighbor. I was here opening day framing walls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he can see the site from his own home, and critics of
affordable housing programs should know that "I'm really proud to
have them in my neighborhood. I can see the project right over my
fence, and I think it's great."</TE>
<TE>   When their homes are complete and the landscaping planted, Nancy
Le and Sean Hwin and their two children; the Samuelson family; and
Felimon and Elena Coria and their eight children can move in.</TE>
<TE>   Habitat selects applicants after verifying their income and that
they are not current homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The new Costa Mesa residents made a 1% down payment and put in at
least 500 hours of labor that each must contribute on either their
homes, their neighbors' or another Habitat project. They will pay
with long-term, zero-interest mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   Hwin and his family will move into a 1,181-square-foot house with
three bedrooms and two baths. The Samuelsons have a 1,272-square-foot
home with four bedrooms and two baths, and the Corias have a
1,332-square-foot home with five bedrooms and two baths. All are
two-story homes with two-car attached garages.</TE>
<TE>   The Del Mar Avenue property, where volunteers began working in
June, has the makings of a small neighborhood within a neighborhood:
three families, 14 children whose dreams have come true.</TE>

<HD>O.C. School Districts Wage Battle for Turf</HD>
<DH>Education: The March 5 election includes construction bond
measures for six systems. If they succeed, the next obstacle will be
finding available land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emboldened by the passage of Proposition 39, which lowered the
threshold to pass school construction bonds from a two-thirds
majority to 55%, six school districts in Orange County--the most in
recent memory--will ask voters to approve $490 million for new
schools and renovation projects March 5.</LD>
<LD>   But for most of these districts, getting the money will be only
half the battle.</LD>
<LD>   All the districts with bond measures are in north Orange County,
where decades of development have gobbled up most of the land. Now,
classrooms are bursting with students, and there is little, if any,
space to build.</LD>
<TE>   "Most of our schools were built around the same time Disneyland
was," in the 1950s, said Lettie Boggs, assistant superintendent of
facilities and operation for the Anaheim City School District. "Back
then there were still orchards in Anaheim. That is certainly no
longer true."</TE>
<TE>   The scarcity of available land is forcing the Anaheim elementary
school district to consider unprecedented measures. If its
$111-million bond passes, the district will for the first time look
to condemn existing buildings--in this case more than 30 apartment
complexes and several businesses--to build schools. It also has plans
for multistory campuses, still a rarity in California, especially for
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   The district was originally built for 11,000 students but has
twice that number, and it is the only Orange County district where
all campuses operate on a year-round calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the district needs land for three new elementary
schools and expansion of three existing campuses.</TE>
<TE>   In all six school districts, the bonds will be repaid with
property tax increases ranging from $16 per $100,000 of assessed
value in the Huntington Beach City School District, which has a
$30-million measure on the March ballot, to $32.50 per $100,000 in
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, which is asking voters
to approve $102 million in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If a separate state bond measure passes in November, the districts
could receive state matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some opponents of the bond measures argue that new schools will
only increase the size of a public education system that they say has
failed its students.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody moves to Anaheim for the schools," said Joan Burke, a
member of Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining Their Environment, a group
opposed to bond measures in the city's school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is [school] vouchers," said Burke, whose grown
children attended the area's public schools. Vouchers, she said,
would allow parents to send their children to private schools, and
thus ease overcrowding at public campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Anaheim City, three other districts plan to build schools.
Anaheim Union High School District, which hopes to pass a
$132-million restoration and construction bond, wants a new junior
high school. Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified plans to build four
schools. And Fullerton School District will build an elementary
school if its $49.7-million bond measure passes.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, districts will have to buy or condemn buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really a sign of the changing times in our community," said
Dennis Smith, superintendent of Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified. "The
perception of a sleepy, suburban area with plenty of land is
certainly not the case anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Of the six bond measures, only the Huntington Beach elementary and
Fullerton high school districts' do not involve land acquisition.
Enrollment has leveled off in the Huntington Beach district,
officials said, and bond money will be used to renovate campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton District Faces 12.5% More Students</TE>
<TE>   The Fullerton Joint Union High School District asks voters to
approve $67.9 million in bonds to repair aging schools and add at
least one building at each of six schools to accommodate a 12.5%
enrollment growth in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The solution will further crowd common areas like playing fields,
but Supt. Michael F. Escalante said it is the best option given the
scarcity of available land.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton, like other North County communities, experienced a
large wave of growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Families, many from Los
Angeles, migrated to north Orange County, beckoned by its suburban
settings. Homes and schools were built to accommodate the newcomers.
Most of those families have moved on, replaced in the last two
decades by a wave of immigrants. Much of the old housing has been
replaced by apartment complexes that hold more families, and school
districts are serving ever larger numbers of students with the same
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The city," Escalante said, "grew around us."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nobody knows the challenges of building schools in Orange
County's new urban reality better than officials at the Santa Ana
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The district's 2-year-old Mendez Fundamental Intermediate School
was built above a shopping mall parking garage. The three-story
project was part of a now-defunct state program that sought creative
solutions to the space crunch in urban school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with $145 million in bond money, the Santa Ana district has
plans to build 13 traditional campuses. But finding the land has been
a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because we have money in the wallet doesn't mean we can go
out and build," said Santa Ana Unified Supt. Al Mijares.</TE>
<TE>   In the two years since the bond measure passed, the district has
acquired land for one school. In an agreement reached with the city
last month, the district will build a high school on a leased parcel
in Centennial Park. The school is projected to open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana district is also embroiled in a legal battle with a
group of homeowners near the proposed Lorin Griset Elementary School
on a vacant lot near the Santa Ana Freeway. The residents, who last
month sued to block the project, say they don't want or need a school
in their backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, pretty much any place in north Orange County is in
someone's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It is getting more and more difficult for growing districts,"
said Duwayne Brooks, director of facilities for the California
Department of Education. "It used to be that if a district wanted to
build a school and the community said it doesn't want it there, you
could go somewhere else. But it is a question of options."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Options and More Obstacles</TE>
<TE>   Local district officials say they have few of them. Stringent
state environmental guidelines further limit the types of lots
schools can be built on and an available site may not be where the
students are.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the crowding grows worse. North Orange County campuses
have some of the highest student populations in California, according
to recent study by the California Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont Elementary in Santa Ana, for example, has 341 students per
acre of school grounds, among the highest in the state and rivaling
density rates of schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Anaheim's
Marshall Elementary has 240 students per acre.</TE>
<TE>   The state-recommended ratio for a typical elementary school is 51
to 61 students per acre.</TE>
<TE>   Overcrowded districts like Santa Ana and Anaheim accommodate more
students by juggling year-round schedules and sometimes dual
sessions, where classes start at different times of the day.
Sometimes two teachers share the same classroom for part of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of facilities is felt in other ways too. In Anaheim,
elementary school students carry chairs to parking lots for school
assemblies, and portable classrooms have become a permanent part of
the landscape at many campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Finding real estate has become a crucial education issue, said
Santa Ana Trustee Nativo V. Lopez. "The land acquisition dilemma
ultimately will resonate in the quality of the education for our
children."</TE>

<HD>Council Hopefuls Become Issue</HD>
<DH>Seal Beach: Incumbent is under investigation, another
candidate is on defensive over residency as questions overshadow city
concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The four candidates in the race for a Seal Beach City Council seat
insist they want to focus on the major issues facing the city, such
as the fate of a large parcel of land off the San Gabriel River,
whether to keep the utility tax and how to improve ocean water
quality.</LD>
<LD>   But an investigation into the alleged misdeeds of incumbent Shawn
Boyd has all but overshadowed those concerns, making him a clear
focal point of the contest.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office is looking into whether Boyd
violated conflict-of-interest laws after he cast votes on the
city-financed purchase of a mobile home park by a nonprofit group
even though he had a business relationship with the park's owner. The
ongoing investigation is focused on $104,000 Boyd received from the
park owner but allegedly did not disclose.</LD>
<TE>   Boyd admits he has made mistakes while in office but said his
overall record on the council has been strong. He has asked voters to
"reflect on what I've done in the almost four years I've been in
office, and it's been a lot."</TE>
<TE>   He said he helped secure funds for new gas, water and sewer lines
in seven alleys in his district and helped obtain grants for a
$1.3-million facelift for the Seal Beach Boulevard and Marina Drive
area. He also wrote the ordinance that outlawed smoking on the pier.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent candidates forum, Boyd and his three
opponents--Charles Antos, Walt Miller and Beverly Pearce--fielded
questions about a number of issues facing the city, including the
utility users tax, the availability of low-income housing and the
future of 10 acres of land owned by the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP property, which has been vacant for more than 30 years,
has been approved for seven acres of open space and a hotel on the
remaining three acres.</TE>
<TE>   A four-story 300-room hotel was originally proposed for the
property, but that plan was scaled down to 150 rooms in a three-story
structure. A developer has yet to purchase the property and submit
formal plans.</TE>
<TE>   Antos, a former planner for the city and now a planner for Orange
County, said he has no problem with the commercial development of the
land but worries that it may still be contaminated with asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time the plan [for the open space and hotel] was adopted
no one knew the property was full of asbestos," Antos said. DWP,
which operated a power plant there until the 1960s, reportedly
conducted a cleanup of the land, "but I don't know if it's all gone.
Prior to building we would want to make sure the property is free of
asbestos before bulldozers start running around throwing dust with
asbestos in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Antos, 56, said the city should either put to a public vote or
eliminate the 11% utility users tax, a large source of revenue for
the city that helps pay for police and fire protection, street
maintenance and parks. Antos said the tax was about 5% when it was
first imposed, but "every time the city needed money, the city
increased it. And it never was put to a vote." The tax is on gas,
electricity, telephone and cable television service.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos has chosen to let voters decide the issue with a
measure on the March ballot. Stanton put such a tax before voters in
November, and it was approved.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a retired accountant, wants to create a "think tank" of
residents who would identify problems in the city and offer
grass-roots solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of talent, dedication to offer and I want to bring
the City Council back to the city and the people of Seal Beach,"
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   He was unavailable to offer expanded comments on the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has been dogged with questions about whether he is a legal
candidate because he has not lived in the city for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 71, listed a 7th Street address as his primary residence,
but he actually lives in Long Beach. He said, however, that he lived
in Seal Beach for 23 years and still owns several pieces of property
there, including the 7th Street home that he rents to his son.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he will move into his son's house in order to
satisfy the residency requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The Boyd investigation has worked its way into the campaign, but
in somewhat muted ways.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Pearce, 51, in a hint at the allegations against Boyd,
said: "I have already disclosed all of my personal financial
dealings, and I will continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   She also attempted to dispel rumors that she was drafted by an
anti-Boyd group to run for his seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I somewhat resent people thinking I was drafted to run for this
office," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearce, who was director of housing and economic development in
Baldwin Park from 1986 to 1991, said she would like to see the
utility users tax lowered to 8% in phases.</TE>
<TE>   The reductions, she said, should be tied to increases in revenue
or as expenditures decrease.</TE>
<TE>   The challengers have been reluctant to directly raise the issue of
Boyd's problems publicly. It was Boyd, in fact, who had the most to
say about the investigation during the candidates' forum.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done everything right," he said. "I don't think anyone
on the council can say that they have....But I've never served my
personal interests. I've served your interests first."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's troubles began after complaints alleging
conflict-of-interest violations were lodged by a Seal Beach resident
with the district attorney and the state Fair Political Practices
Commission in September.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office launched an investigation in
October. In January, armed with search warrants, investigators
searched Boyd's Seal Beach home and an apartment where he has been
staying.</TE>
<TE>   They were seeking evidence that links him to Richard Hall, who
bought the Seal Beach Trailer Park for $2.9 million in 1998 and sold
it two years later to a nonprofit group for $7.4 million, backed by
city financing. Boyd abstained from votes regarding the trailer park
purchase four times, but voted on the matter at least seven times
without disclosing that he worked for Hall on at least two other real
estate ventures.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not reveal his relationship with Hall or abstain
from voting because he had not yet been paid for the other ventures
and didn't consider the votes to be a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   At the forum, a contrite Boyd said: "I'm sorry for some of the
mistakes I've made and I've apologized. The bottom line is I care
about Seal Beach."</TE>

<HD>Brea's Make-Over Has Restaurateur Nervous</HD>
<DH>Urban renewal: Owner of building dreads being forced out.
City denies it'll do that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>La Esquina Restaurant has been a fixture in downtown Brea for almost
50 years, an establishment that loyal customers--some who drive in
from neighboring cities--regard as a second home.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly 100-year-old building has been a Mexican restaurant for
much of its time. Leo Ramirez bought the place in 1965 and originally
named it the Corner Cafe.</LD>
<LD>   But now, as new retail buildings sprout up and down North Brea
Boulevard--products of downtown redevelopment--Ramirez's widow says
she is being prodded by the city to sell out.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, the city purchased a medical office two doors down and
razed the building. Now, city officials have offered to buy Ramirez's
restaurant and the office building next door, which was converted
from a house built in 1908. "I'm scared," said Adela Ramirez, 53, a
Brea resident for 31 years. "I saw what happened on the boulevard,
where people who owned businesses for many years were forced to move
so new stores could be built. My husband and I worked very hard to
establish the restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Tim O'Donnell said officials have had "friendly
discussions" with Ramirez about acquiring her property. But he said
the City Council has not authorized its acquisition through eminent
domain, the process by which government can condemn private property.
And he denied that the city will force her out.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, a native of Jalisco, Mexico, said she would feel added
pressure to sell if the building owners next door agree on a sale
price with the city. Accountant Rudy Silva, part-owner of the office
building, said he would consider selling. "I'm OK with that, if they
pay me a fair price," said Silva, who said he is waiting for the
results of an appraisal done by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Silva's building and the restaurant are the only structures left
on the block on their side of the street. Brea is one of the oldest
cities in Orange County, but much of the boulevard is hardly
distinguishable from the retail centers built in the county's newest
start-up towns. Mom-and-pop stores have given way to chain stores and
fast-food restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The two buildings eyed by city officials are elegant leftovers
from Brea's turn-of-the-century downtown. The storefronts are
landscaped, the architecture distinctive and the buildings' interiors
a throwback to a different time. In contrast, newer buildings along
the street appear as if they've fallen out of a mold.</TE>
<TE>   Demolition Likely If Buildings Acquired</TE>
<TE>   If the city acquires the properties, O'Donnell said they would be
sold to a developer, and the buildings probably would be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   "We target certain neighborhoods. When properties become available
we buy them, combine the lots and do a decent project that would work
for the neighborhood," said O'Donnell. "We see an opportunity to
stimulate the economic development of the block. No single property
owner can do that."</TE>
<TE>   But Ramirez's customers say they want the restaurant to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the building. It's beautiful and old. It's different from
all of the development around it," said retiree Paul Segura. He and
his wife, Maria, live in La Habra but eat lunch at La Esquina as many
as three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Schlater, who works in a nearby office, said she eats lunch
at the restaurant at least three times a week. Sometimes more.</TE>
<TE>   "She's worried, and I can't blame her," said Schlater, nibbling on
a carnitas taco and taking sips from a bowl of tortilla soup. "The
city should realize that old places like this are nice to keep. A
business like this is like a second home to people like Adela. Find a
newer place that's part of a chain and you won't find the home
atmosphere you have here."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said she works seven days a week at the restaurant. It's
been like that for 32 years, since she married her husband, who died
11 years ago. "It's very tiring, but because I'm the sole owner I
have to be involved in everything," she said. "I'm here so much that
hardly anybody comes in whom I don't know. I've got a waiter who has
worked for me for more than 15 years. He knows all of our customers."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez and her husband raised two daughters, who spent much of
their adolescent years helping out in the restaurant. Now, they do
not want anything to do with the business, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said she has already rejected a $700,000 offer from the
city to sell her restaurant. Although $700,000 is a substantial sum,
Ramirez is concerned that it would not be enough to open a restaurant
in Orange County at a good location, given property and equipment
costs. She is also concerned about whether a new restaurant would
even be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "The restaurant has been good to my family, and it's the only work
I know," she said. "At my age, I cannot afford to gamble on a new
business. And after paying taxes and other debts, I'd probably end up
with half of the money the city gives me.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only 53 and the restaurant is my only source of income. What
am I going to do the rest of my life? That's not enough money to
retire on or open another business. That's why I'm scared."</TE>
<TE>   Silva, the CPA next door, said he understands Ramirez's concern.
He has been in his building six years and has already moved his
business once from Montebello. "I'm not worried about losing clients.
They'll follow me wherever I move to," he said. "But with her, it's a
different story. Even if she opened another restaurant it'll be hard
to keep the old customers and build up a new list of loyal ones."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell, who said he has eaten at Ramirez's restaurant many
times over the years, insisted that "if she doesn't want to sell,
that's it. We're gone."</TE>
<TE>   But Silva believes that the city will ultimately end up with the
properties, one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   "Either through eminent domain or they'll meet an owner's selling
price. But it doesn't surprise me that they've got their eye on these
properties. The city's intentions were obvious after they took over
the medical office next door and tore it down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Ramirez said she will wait and see what the future
brings. She also worries about what will happen to her five employees
if she is forced to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about whether they'll be able to find jobs," she said.
"I'm alone, but some of them have families."</TE>

<HD>Top Power Players Come Calling on Hollywood Women</HD>
<DH>Influence: From Gov. Davis to world leaders, they drop by
to give briefings on terrorism, anthrax, other issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the stately reception room of a Hollywood power couple, Gov. Gray
Davis and a phalanx of advisors and experts stood before a crowd of
prominent Los Angeles women at the height of the anthrax crisis and
gave a command briefing.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting in this improvised war room--equipped with maps,
pointers and charts--was hosted by a charity board member whose
husband is a respected film producer. In light of the anthrax deaths,
she told the gathering, we must learn to protect ourselves, not rely
on the government.</LD>
<LD>   Standing before a wall of windows that back-lighted him with
luminous midday sun, Davis assured the 20 women that he was moving
quickly to toughen airport security, protect bridges, test the
water--and he was eager to hear their concerns.</LD>
<TE>   "As you all know, Sept. 11 changed everyone's world," Davis said,
as guests sipped white wine, and his wife, Sharon Davis, took a seat.
"Education is still my passion, but now my highest priority has to be
keeping you safe."</TE>
<TE>   While Bush administration spin master Karl Rove was summoning
Hollywood to talk patriotism in a post-9/11 world, a cadre of
well-connected Hollywood women have been doing some summoning of
their own.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans are reading books on Islamic fundamentalism and
germ warfare. These women are bringing officials and bioterrorism
experts into their living rooms and peppering them with the
questions, large and small, that have haunted Americans since the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   They call themselves the Industry Task Force for Emergency
Response and Preparedness. In a Hollywood-driven city, does anyone
need to ask which industry?</TE>
<TE>   Their milieu is accustomed to access: Mexican President Vicente
Fox laid out the challenges of the drug war last year. Israeli
President Moshe Katsav was the guest of honor at an at-home dinner
for 100 people last June held to--as one host put it--"introduce him
to the community." Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton were regulars
during their political campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The women invited by the task force have clout. Philanthropist
Cheryl Saban and her husband, television deal-maker and top
Democratic Party contributor Haim Saban, knew their way around the
Clinton White House. An actress who hosted a meeting with Rep. Henry
A. Waxman (D-Calif.) is married to one of Hollywood's highest-paid
male stars. Nancy Daly Riordan is a children's advocate whose
husband, Richard Riordan, is a Republican contender for governor.
Sharon Davis' husband is running for reelection as governor. Barbra
Streisand is a power broker on multiple fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to join together to educate people and see if there's
anything we can do to prevent more terrorism. This is not a group of
dilettantes," said a task force leader, Wendy Goldberg, who was a
contributing editor to the book "Hollywood Moms."</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal," said Irena Medavoy, the driving force behind the
group, "is to facilitate the implementation of a unified state and
national program for emergency preparedness and response."</TE>
<TE>   The task force has even drawn up a family emergency plan, with
evacuation strategies, first aid tips and passwords so kids can vet a
strange driver who might pick them up at school after a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Davis said the plan is already in the hands of California
state security expert George Vinson, who will determine if it can
complement existing disaster preparedness drills, such as Earthquake
Week, or be posted on Web sites or sent to schools.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities have offered to make public service announcements.</TE>
<TE>   "The president called people to action. This is what this
community felt they could do," said Davis, who has been in touch with
the group--"a lot of these women are personal friends of mine"--since
its genesis.</TE>
<TE>   She attended the most recent briefing, held Jan. 30,  by Bill
Patrick, whose bioterrorism street cred is rooted in his unique past
as a manager of the now-defunct U.S. biological weapons program.
That's the unit that dreamed up ways to kill America's enemies with
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm going to frighten you," said Patrick, 76, a stolid,
balding gentleman who delights in gallows humor. The group was
bivouacked that day at the Beverly Hills mansion of an influential
task force leader who declined to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick launched into a treatise on world germ stockpiles and how
something as banal as a leaf blower could scatter deadly microbes.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick--who has briefed secretaries of defense, consulted for the
CIA and FBI, and was the oldest U.N. weapons inspector in
Iraq--waived his usual speaking fee.</TE>
<TE>   "These are dedicated, patriotic ladies who have power, prestige
and money," he said. "I was surprised at the depth of their
information."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. By that time, the women had been briefed on security by
former Secret Service agent Chuck Vance. They had talked Osama bin
Laden with Mideast expert Herb Cohen. They had discussed health
issues with Susan Blumenthal, a Bush administration assistant surgeon
general. They had hosted a dozen power briefings.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we had this access to all these smart people. It was really
our responsibility to pass this along to people," said Cynthia Sikes
Yorkin, an actress and charity activist.</TE>
<TE>   The movable think tank began in uncertain times last fall, when
the threat of anthrax had become a reality and authorities feared
terrorists could target California bridges or shopping malls.</TE>
<TE>   "We started out wanting to educate our own families," said Shawn
King, who runs a foundation with her husband, CNN television host
Larry King, that arranges for heart surgery for people without health
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The wife of a studio executive invited UCLA infectious diseases
professor Peter Katona.  Katona made his way up to Medavoy's
mountaintop mansion in a gated Westside community, armed with
photocopied fact sheets and a seven-page resume listing his
publications--"Are Preparations for Bioterrorism Futile?"--and his
home phone number and address.</TE>
<TE>   On an enormous screen usually used to preview Hollywood films,
Katona fast-forwarded a Power Point presentation through a grim
Cliffs Notes of germ war history, from the medieval warriors who
catapulted the corpses of smallpox victims into enemy castles to the
more sophisticated capabilities of Iraqi bete noir Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Then Katona departed from the intelligence briefing format and
zeroed in on local fears.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you have Cipro in your medicine cabinet?" Katona
asked the women.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills, he told them, was the first city in America to run
out of Cipro, the antibiotic prescribed against anthrax. No one
seemed surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband is a prominent figure in the entertainment industry,
and he's received a direct threat," said a woman in an elegant black
suit and Santa Fe-style silver jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   The room grew silent. Hollywood is considered a potential target.
And Hollywood is their life.</TE>
<TE>   "I've told my staff not to open any mail," the woman continued.
"Is there anything I can do to make it safe?"</TE>
<TE>   Heads nodded. People murmured suggestions. Maybe microwave it?
Katona shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "You could iron it," he offered.</TE>
<TE>   People exploded in laughter. Of course! Our staff can iron the
mail!</TE>
<TE>   Another practical issue: "Is it safe to go to the Lakers game
Thursday night?"</TE>
<TE>   Everyone nodded. Some had courtside seats. They know Shaquille
O'Neal socially. They do lunch with Laker wives.</TE>
<TE>   In an America that's still afraid to fly on airplanes, a lot of
fears about international terrorism boil down to whether it's safe to
go to malls and movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowledge is power," said Goldberg, as she left. "It makes you
feel better."</TE>
<TE>   Next Katona brought in another UCLA professor, Scott Layne, a
onetime staff member at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
who teaches a class on terrorism and mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think any time people have a forum to educate themselves on
things that are valuable to society, it's important,'' Katona said.</TE>
<TE>   Layne wants to create an infectious disease testing laboratory
that could deter the spread of diseases like anthrax. He like to
approach the Gates Foundation for support.</TE>
<TE>   ''Somebody we know will get him to Bill Gates,'' Medavoy said.</TE>
<TE>   ''These people are in a position to do something constructive,''
Katona said. ''They have access to people of power.''</TE>
<TE>   That may be one reason--aside from a web of social ties between
Washington and Hollywood--that experts visiting Los Angeles add task
force briefings, free, to their schedules.</TE>
<TE>   When Gov. Davis filed in to the Medavoys' with his entourage late
last year, he gazed out at a roomful of Democratic fund-raising
muscle that most Republican candidates can only dream of in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The Valentino and Armani crowd was a different tribe than the
bleary-eyed pinstriped pilgrims who sip coffee at 8 a.m. briefings at
Washington think tanks.</TE>
<TE>   James Carville once described Washington as ''Hollywood for ugly
people.''</TE>
<TE>   But this is L.A. The well-groomed sea of faces staring back at
Davis included people like actress Kelly Lynch and Ms. America Susan
Jeske--who was invited not by the task force, but by a soberly
attired expert who talked about bringing her to a Rome summit with
the Afghan king.</TE>
<TE>   The women peppered the experts with questions: ''Is California
ready for a terrorist attack?'' ''What role will women have in the
new Afghan government?''</TE>
<TE>   Peter Thompson, a former U.S. envoy to Afghanistan, spieled
details on the coalescing Kabul government--some so up-to-date they
had not been publicly announced.</TE>
<TE>   Everything has snowballed since then. Nowadays, a
Cambridge-educated assistant to columnist Arianna Huffington, Peter
Abbott, takes the minutes of each briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Drafts of the emergency plan are clogging faxes all over town.</TE>
<TE>   ''Fear is not the focus now,'' Medavoy said. ''I've given away my
gas mask. I don't have a supply of Cipro. The concern now is: to have
California be the No. 1 state in showcasing the new century's
response to bioterrorism preparedness.''</TE>

<HD>Cheers Hide Trouble for Governor</HD>
<DH>Politics: Disaffection for Davis among core Democrats is
apparent at state party's convention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The television image of Gov. Gray Davis basking in chants of "four
more years" offered no hint of the trouble he faced this weekend at a
Los Angeles hotel crammed with Democratic Party loyalists.</LD>
<LD>   For all the cheers, Davis has disappointed some Democratic
stalwarts, and many delegates at the state party convention that
ended Sunday were open about their lack of enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   Delegate Ted Roy, a Barstow teacher, gave Davis a "C" for overall
job performance.</LD>
<TE>   "I wouldn't consider voting for a Republican, but I might vote for
somebody from the Green Party," Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   The disaffection of Roy, an African American, reflects one of the
biggest challenges facing Davis in his quest for reelection: to shore
up his flagging support among blacks, Latinos, union members and
other core Democratic constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half of the governor's fellow Democrats are committed
to supporting him in the November election, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll taken last month.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that Gray Davis is in a vulnerable position,"
said Democratic strategist Darry Sragow.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Davis' quandary is similar to the one faced by his
leading adversary among California Republicans, former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan. Both politicians enjoy their strongest support
among moderate members of their own party, and both have trouble
energizing more ideological party loyalists.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, the issue is more acute, as he faces a primary
challenge from two conservative Republicans, financier Bill Simon Jr.
and Secretary of State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   But even for Davis, who is effectively unopposed in the Democratic
primary, the support of the party's base will be important for him to
prevail in November. Party loyalists tend to vote with greater
frequency, and even if they are unlikely to vote for a candidate from
the opposite party, candidates generally cannot afford to give them a
reason to sit out an election.</TE>
<TE>   At the convention Saturday, Davis attributed his tepid support
among Democrats to California's energy crisis. He said he was so
consumed by the struggle to avert blackouts last year that he was
unable to tend to his political base.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do all the things you would normally do, which is run
around and tout your record, pat yourself on the back and tell people
what you've done," he said. "Now, we are telling our story."</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights, he said, were a rise in school test scores
and expansion of health insurance for children.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also blamed his relatively low popularity on ads his
political opponents ran last year on radio and television attacking
him for his handling of the energy crisis, as well as the recent
storm of criticism from Jones, Riordan and Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "When three people are running against you, saying you're
responsible for everything from athlete's foot to the drought, it
takes its toll," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also problematic, Davis allies said, is his admitted lack of
charisma.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray has never been and never will be Mr. Personality," said
state Democratic Chairman Art Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse for Davis is the $12-billion state budget
shortfall that has forced him to propose cuts in popular programs
amid his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences were clear at the Democratic convention. Roy, a
special education teacher at Barstow Middle School, was annoyed at
job-training cuts that Davis proposed. Wayne Barela, a Solano County
delegate, faulted Davis for postponing an expansion of the children's
health insurance program so that parents will also qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have sold out on that one," Barela said.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists said the centrist governor has suffered from unduly
high expectations among liberals who thought that he would pursue a
more progressive agenda than he actually had promised in his 1998
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But during the last year, Davis has taken a number of steps to
appeal to the party's base. He ended a self-imposed moratorium on new
gun control laws by signing legislation requiring a safety exam and
license to buy a handgun. He signed another measure making it a state
crime to threaten abortion clinics and approved a proposal to put a
$2.6-billion parks bond measure on the March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis signed legislation to increase the benefits paid
to California workers injured on the job. The measure was a top
priority for organized labor, a group that has strongly supported
Davis but has been frustrated by his resistance to other parts of its
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had vetoed previous versions of the worker's compensation
measure three times. But at the convention, labor delegates were
effusive over his reversal.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has been wonderful for workers," said Chester Wasko
Jr., a Long Beach crane operator and a leader of Operating Engineers
Local 12. "I work with people that have been crushed in cave-ins on
the job. This will help their families survive."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, despite the discontent with Davis among Democrats, many
still voiced full support. On energy, in particular, many gave him
credit for making the best of a bad situation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a victim of the Texas oil people," said Humberto Lujan
of Norwalk, an avionics technician.</TE>
<TE>   "He was set up," he said. "We're dealing with some very
intelligent people within the corporate structure who are trying to
do him in, because he's a great threat to the Bush administration,
and they want to make him look as bad as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Democratic strategist Joe Cerrell said that once the
Republicans choose a challenger in the March 5 primary, the
Democratic Party base is likely to rally behind Davis--no matter how
reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes right down to it," he said, "they have no choice."</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Chief Defends Fatal Shooting</HD>
<DH>Justice: Race played no role in the death of the
knife-wielding woman, says Jerome Lance as he tries to shore up
police relations with the community at a forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach Police Chief Jerome E. Lance on Sunday defended his
officers' shooting last month of a knife-wielding black woman,
denying allegations that race played a role.</LD>
<LD>   "Had it been my mother, it would have been handled the same,"
Lance told a crowd of about 100 at a public forum of the National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting prompted a protest march last week and an
unprecedented number of complaint calls to the NAACP.</LD>
<TE>   "Put your son, your daughter, your mother in that position. You
won't fire the bullet," Clarence Robbins, 63, responded to Lance,
drawing loud applause.</TE>
<TE>   But the forum ended with applause for the chief after one man
called him courageous for addressing their concerns and others
commended him for trying to improve police-community relations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a first step for what has to be an ongoing dialogue,"
said Noemi Raines, president of the Long Beach NAACP.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred on a Saturday morning when Marcella Byrd,
57, allegedly brandished a knife at employees of a downtown store and
then left without paying for groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Police confronted her on Pine Avenue, where she was walking toward
the downtown restaurant district.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they shot her with two miniature bean-bag rounds meant
to stun her, but Byrd, who weighed 277 pounds, did not stop.</TE>
<TE>   After following her for a block and ordering her several times to
stop and drop the knife, police said, Byrd waved the weapon
menacingly at them.</TE>
<TE>   Three officers opened fire, shooting eight rounds. Byrd died at a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Police later learned that Byrd was schizophrenic. Her family said
she refused to take medication, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Lance refused to address specific questions about the shooting,
saying that the matter is under investigation and that pending
litigation prohibits him from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   But he said officers are allowed to fire if they perceive a
threat, and they followed policy by shooting at Byrd's torso, not her
limbs.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where they are trained to shoot, and that's where she was
shot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents wondered why the officers didn't use an attack
dog, fire hoses or some other means to stop Byrd.</TE>
<TE>   "Murder, that's what it was," said Ronald Jordan, president of the
Black Student Alliance at Long Beach City College.</TE>
<TE>   Royce Esters, president of the National Assn. for Equal Justice in
America, a Compton-based group, said: "I don't know how in the world
she could have thrown a knife and hit three or four officers from 15
to 20 feet. They could have talked to that lady, even if it took 100
hours." Lance admitted the department had some "bad apples" and said
he had recommended that several officers be fired for abusive
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   But the chief also called his department a leader in cultural
awareness programs.</TE>
<TE>   Some community leaders said tensions will remain until the
department completes its report of the incident, which is expected in
three months.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this will lead us to have a safer community and a better
[police] department," said Councilwoman Laura Richardson-Batts.</TE>

<HD>Community Enlisted in New War on Gangs</HD>
<DH>Initiative: The LAPD, in response to a rise in violence
Valleywide in 2001, is working with schools and churches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharp increase in gang-related crime over the past year has spurred
police and community leaders in the San Fernando Valley to pursue a
more coordinated effort to combat gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike past efforts largely driven by Los Angeles police
commanders or summits that brought warring factions together, the new
initiative would have police work more closely with people connected
to children and teenagers, including those who work in schools and
religious and community organizations, LAPD Deputy Chief Ronald
Bergman said.</LD>
<LD>   "There's probably more gang members in the Valley than we've ever
had, and gang violence is spiking again," Bergman said. "What we're
trying to figure out is what works and spearhead a Valleywide effort
to combat gang violence and gang membership."</LD>
<TE>   Police estimate 407 street gangs with about 55,385 members are
operating in the city of Los Angeles. Some 20,000 members are in the
Valley, they estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the Los Angeles Police Department has used
specialized units and court injunctions to combat gangs. More
recently, the department has teamed with probation and corrections
officers and prosecutors in an anti-gang program called CLEAR, or
Community Law Enforcement and Recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Praised for its success in cutting gang crime in the Valley's
Devonshire and Foothill divisions, CLEAR saw its budget slashed to $1
million this year from the original $3-million state grant in 1997.
Simultaneously, there were fewer officers to combat all crime as LAPD
staffing levels fell by 900 officers from the peak of about 9,800 in
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   As staffing fell, gang violence, including murder, attempted
murder, rape, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, jumped by
7.1% Valleywide in the last year. Those factors, coupled with the
potential recruiting bonanza for gangs among the new generation of
at-risk youngsters, demand a broad-based approach, Bergman and others
said. Police and community groups have held two meetings since
December that drew more than 300 people interested in coming up with
ideas to fight gangs. More meetings are planned, Bergman said.
Several concepts appear particularly promising, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One would expand the LAPD's relationship with the Los Angeles
Unified School District to identify gang members or aspirants and
steer the high-risk students to the Jeopardy Program, Police
Activities League or other community-based groups.</TE>
<TE>   Police commanders also are considering strengthening ties with
local clergy, not only to set up more community-based programs but to
communicate with congregants about anti-crime programs.</TE>
<TE>   Within law enforcement, Bergman said he wants to expand the CLEAR
concept among the LAPD's five Valley divisions and beyond. City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the council's Public Safety
Committee, said it may be expanded to the Central Bureau, which
includes the Central, Rampart, Hollenbeck, Northeast and Newton
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "People who wanted to help just needed this network superstructure
to say we're out here," Miscikowski said. "Obviously, we need more
money and more resources, but this shows how we can pull together."</TE>
<TE>   Wes McBride, a retired Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
gang expert, said anti-gang programs often become ineffective because
they are seldom sustained.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the gang crime drops the politicians declare victory
and walk away," he said. "It's like a cancer. You have to remain
vigilant. If you're not on top of it, it will come back and worse
than before."</TE>
<TE>   McBride said he favors community involvement because gangs are
part of the community. Without that input and support, he said,
"You're an [occupying] army."</TE>

<DH>Housing: Hundreds of low-cost dwellings repossessed by HUD
will be sold by a nonprofit foundation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The powder blue house on Mott Street might have ended up like scores
of other homes repossessed by HUD: boarded up, vacant, a nuisance to
the community.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, a miniature basketball hoop sits in the frontyard, neat
white curtains hang from the kitchen window, and a family of four
calls this home.</LD>
<LD>   The family purchased the Boyle Heights property through a program
that transforms renters into homeowners--and addresses long-held
complaints about the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's handling of properties taken over when owners default
on government-backed loans.</LD>
<TE>   "We buy assets from HUD that are eyesores," said Ann Sewill,
director of California programs for the Enterprise Foundation. "We
fix them up and we turn them into assets for the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, the foundation will renovate nearly 1,700
HUD-repossessed homes in Los Angeles over the next three years, then
sell them to low- and moderate-income buyers like Juan Gonzalez and
Veronica Salcedo, both 28, who recently became the first family in
the city to purchase a home through the program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect," Salcedo said. "We liked it as soon as we saw it."</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope the collaborative effort among HUD, the
Enterprise Foundation and the city will also help rejuvenate some of
the city's besieged communities.</TE>
<TE>   In some of those areas, the federal agency's homes have been part
of the problem. The Enterprise program grew out of a realization that
HUD is good at lending money to buy houses but "wasn't very good at
selling them," said Alan Greenlee, public policy director for
Enterprise in California.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide each year, HUD repossesses an estimated 70,000 homes.
In Los Angeles County, the agency acquires 2,700 to 3,000 properties
annually. The properties are managed and sold by Golden Feather
Realty Services, a private contractor with headquarters in San
Antonio. But the homes sometimes end up boarded up and vacant for
long periods, causing neighborhood blight, housing advocates say. In
some cases the houses become magnets for all the things homeowners
dread: drug dealing, gangs, transients.</TE>
<TE>   "There've been stories of women being raped, they become drug
havens, all kinds of malfeasance--especially if you had a few on the
same street," said Doug Smith, manager of the home ownership unit of
the Los Angeles Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   In a classic case of one bad apple spoiling the bunch, the entire
neighborhood sometimes suffers. Potential buyers shy away from the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you want to own a house next to a crack house owned by
HUD, and how do you get HUD to do anything?" Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of boarded-up homes is especially galling for housing
advocates as the city struggles with an affordable-housing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is home to more renters than any other city in the
nation except New York: 61.4% here are renters, while only 38.6% own
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our neighborhoods are filled with vacant properties that have
Golden Feather signs," said Peter Kuhns of the Assn. of Community
Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). "Our people want to see a
program that will see them move people quickly into the homes."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Golden Feather said such claims are inaccurate but
declined to comment for the record and referred all questions to HUD.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of Enterprise Home Ownership Partners--which carries out
the Enterprise Foundation's work with HUD--is to move the
department's properties back onto the market as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement with HUD allows designated cities and nonprofit
organizations to buy HUD-repossessed properties at a bargain, to
rehabilitate the homes and to sell them at affordable prices.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Bates, director of HUD's Homeownership Center in Santa Ana,
called the collaboration "a very effective tool to ... repair the
houses that we acquire through foreclosure and [provide] them to the
people who are in most need."</TE>
<TE>   Enterprise has been designated a preferred buyer of HUD homes in
Watts, Canoga Park, Boyle Heights, Highland Park, Pacoima and parts
of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has agreed to buy every property that HUD
repossesses in those communities. HUD sells the properties to
Enterprise at 50% less than the appraised value.</TE>
<TE>   Enterprise, a support organization for local nonprofit groups,
expects to spend $32 million to buy and repair the houses each year.
A dozen affordable-housing developers oversee construction, and the
Los Angeles Community Design Center is the program's asset manager,
responsible for securing and keeping the properties up.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to produce completely rehabbed houses so families who
have spent all their money on a down payment will not soon be saddled
with huge repair bills.</TE>
<TE>   Many Homes Need Major Repairs</TE>
<TE>   Of the nearly 200 homes purchased by Enterprise thus far, about a
quarter were built before 1923, and most require significant
repairs--things like new plumbing, heating and roofs. Bedrooms are
added, where possible, to accommodate larger families.</TE>
<TE>   The city has pledged $33 million in "gap" financing to make the
homes more affordable.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez and his wife placed a $3,000 down payment on the
Mott Street house and qualified for a loan of $110,000. But the sales
price was $139,000, plus closing costs and fees. The city's Housing
Department closed the gap and covered other costs with a $33,000
no-interest loan that need not be repaid until the family sells the
house or refinances.</TE>
<TE>   Local organizations also provide training, which all buyers must
receive, in how to purchase and finance a home, said Greenlee, the
Enterprise public policy director. The foundation reviews all
financing too.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want them to get in a situation where they're in over
their heads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County officials said a similar arrangement with
HUD is helping turn around several communities. There, instead of
going through a nonprofit group like Enterprise, HUD is working
directly with the county, which has purchased 572 repossessed HUD
properties, with 406 already rehabilitated and sold.</TE>
<TE>   The income limit for potential buyers is $55,000. The average
house costs about $101,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of those houses were boarded up and had been on the market
for years before we got involved," said Tom Laurin, director of
economic and community development for the county.</TE>
<TE>   Ownership Improves Neighborhoods</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, HUD-repossessed homes are often concentrated in
neighborhoods with few homeowners. More owners in the neighborhood
means more people with a stake and more community involvement, said
Sewill of the Enterprise Foundation. "It'll help increase the
livability of the neighborhood as a whole," she said. "It'll stop
neighborhood blight and nuisances."</TE>
<TE>   Before purchasing their home, Gonzalez and Salcedo paid $600 a
month to rent a one-bedroom Highland Park condominium with no yard
for the children. After saving for two years, the couple had amassed
about $4,000. Gonzalez sells auto parts, while Salcedo cares for
their two children.</TE>
<TE>   Months of looking for a home that fit their budget and other needs
were fruitless until the family found the house on Mott Street and
the special financing. It seemed too good to turn down.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Gonzalez's friends told him the neighborhood was too
rough. But he was eager to avoid repeating his parents' error.</TE>
<TE>   "When [my dad] was younger, he was making good money and didn't
think about buying a home," Gonzalez said. "They wanted me to [buy]
while I'm young and not make the same mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Recently Gonzalez did something he had never done before: He mowed
the grass of his own yard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nice experience," he said. "It probably won't be that
great later on. But being it was the first time, it was pretty nice."</TE>

<HD>Memo Angers INS Agents</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Directive tells officers at LAX to focus
almost exclusively on arriving flights. Some fear the strategy could
endanger the public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. immigration authorities at Los Angeles International Airport are
so pressured to carry out inspections of arriving international
passengers that a top official has instructed agents "not to respond"
to concerns from airlines about illegal immigrants elsewhere in the
airport.</LD>
<LD>   The controversial directive, outlined in an internal memo to LAX
inspectors last week, was meant to focus the airport's almost 300
immigration officers on inspection duties and have them avoid other,
potentially distracting tasks.</LD>
<LD>   But the move has enraged many veteran officers who call it an
example of misplaced agency priorities that could endanger the
public.</LD>
<TE>   The squabble is indicative of the kinds of problems that continue
to plague the Immigration and Naturalization Service--which, despite
years of budget increases, lacks enough staff to perform its
wide-ranging and often-conflicting duties. Managers often rely on a
triage approach, ignoring some problem areas while attacking those
deemed more crucial.</TE>
<TE>   At airports, inspectors must both facilitate the arrival of
legitimate passengers and quickly spot lawbreakers attempting to
sneak into the country, often with counterfeit documents. The INS
prevention system has come under withering criticism since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks because three of the 19 foreign-born hijackers
had overstayed their visas.</TE>
<TE>   Especially drawing officers' indignation is wording in the memo
that appears to discourage officers from responding to incidents of
suspected terrorism and other serious crimes in the interest of
keeping an eye on arriving international flights.</TE>
<TE>   "People are shocked and appalled," said one veteran INS officer,
who asked not to be named, fearing retribution. "It places the
traveling public in grave danger."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas J. Schiltgen, INS district director in Los Angeles, denied
that the memo showed the agency is backing away from its efforts to
combat terrorism--the top priority of the service's parent agency,
the Justice Department. The INS in Los Angeles and nationwide has
worked closely with the FBI since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focused on terrorism; we're focused on criminals," said
Schiltgen. "We just need to decide who, administratively, we have
assigned to do that work."</TE>
<TE>   INS staffing at LAX has increased steadily in recent years, but
authorities rely heavily on overtime hours to keep up with burgeoning
numbers of passengers. Tightened security since Sept. 11 has resulted
in some shuffling of duties and other changes--including the carrying
of firearms by all inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal 2001, immigration officers at LAX inspected 8.5 million
arriving passengers, the second highest total in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Since at least the fall of 2000, internal documents show, INS
management at the airport has sought to cut down on investigating
"non-arriving illegal aliens"--that is, those who do not disembark
from international flights. Many are illegal immigrants recently
smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border and now headed to destinations
elsewhere in the United States. LAX is a major trans-shipment point
for such groups.</TE>
<TE>   The memo that caused the LAX flare-up was sent Tuesday by Michael
A. Cochran, acting deputy port director. Prompting the directive, one
official said, was an incident a few days earlier in which INS
officers, responding to a report from an airline, detained 10
suspected illegal immigrants from Central America who were about to
board a flight for the East Coast. All were released after six hours
or so in custody, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there is some special, extenuating circumstance, we are
not to respond to calls from airlines requesting that we examine the
documents of suspected illegal aliens," Cochran wrote on behalf of G.
Thomas Graber, the INS port director. Even "if something 'special'
does come up, i.e., suspected terrorists, kidnapping, slavery or
other, we should not go and arrest groups of people."</TE>
<TE>   The memo cited the difficulties of transporting such suspects into
the secure inspection zone, where INS and customs officers examine
passengers arriving on international flights.</TE>
<TE>   "Please think about this," the memo said. "Do you think that they
should be brought to within our 'sterile inspections area?' "</TE>
<TE>   Schiltgen acknowledged Friday that the memo's references to
terrorism and serious crimes were inappropriate and would be
corrected. "That wasn't the intent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, in the tense airport atmosphere since Sept. 11, the
suggestion that INS agents at LAX should be less than vigilant about
illegal immigrants boarding planes stunned some INS officers.</TE>
<TE>   "With all respect, it is precisely this type of thinking which has
led to [millions of] illegal aliens living and working in the United
States," one officer wrote in a widely distributed e-mail response.
"Our management's approach to the problem is to tell us what we
cannot do to stop this illegal entry.... God help the American
public."</TE>

<HD>What's It Like to Be a TV Producer? The Job Shadow Knows</HD>
<DH>Careers: Kevin Fernley and other high school students learn
the ropes at a studio as part of a national program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixteen-year-old Kevin Fernley spent a day last week touring studio
sets, doing lunch and brainstorming ideas for a TV program with Scott
St. John, executive producer of the reality shows "Street Smarts" and
"Change of Heart."</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a kid whose previous Hollywood connections were the
lighting guy for Jay Leno's "The Tonight Show" and the woman who
serves cafe mocha to the cast of NBC's "Friends."</LD>
<LD>   Fernley and 50 other students from the Burbank Unified School
District got prime face time last Wednesday with Warner Bros.
producers, vice presidents, animators and crew as part of a
nationwide job-shadowing program that kicked off this month.</LD>
<TE>   "This is so awesome," said Fernley, a gum-chomping junior at John
Burroughs High School, who hopes to become a show business
photographer.</TE>
<TE>   He glanced at the studio's downtown back lot and grinned. "Not
many people get to do this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, more than 1 million students and 100,000
businesses will participate in Job Shadowing 2002.</TE>
<TE>   School officials and business leaders match students with mentors
for a day on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Teens gain a better understanding of available career options,
said Stuart Shapiro, executive director of the job shadow coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "The program has a phenomenal impact," Shapiro said. "Kids might
choose a career based on their job shadow experience."</TE>
<TE>   They might also land summer jobs or internships and make contacts
that last a lifetime. This is what Fernley hoped to do during his day
of following St. John.</TE>
<TE>   "Contacts," Fernley said, pausing, "they're a ticket into the
entertainment industry."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing this, Fernley and his classmates fidgeted as they met
their mentors near the Warner Bros. commissary, where George Clooney,
Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston dine.</TE>
<TE>   Some were so nervous that their heads hung low and they barely
spoke a word. Others, like Fernley, treated the studio insiders as if
they were favorite uncles.</TE>
<TE>   "You should let me take this for a spin," Fernley joked as St.
John drove a WB golf cart from the main lot and along Olive Avenue to
a high-rise housing Telepictures Productions, a Warner Bros.
subsidiary that produces the reality shows.</TE>
<TE>   The two even looked similar: thin build, long eyelashes and
closely-cropped hair. But Fernley dressed in creaseless khakis with a
burgundy button shirt while his mentor wore rumpled shorts, a lime
green shirt and orange-and-black flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the 10th floor, St. John took his protege on a tour past
offices overlooking the San Fernando Valley, licorice-laden candy
carts and shelves stuffed with "lawyer books that nobody ever reads,"
the mentor joked.</TE>
<TE>   St. John led the teenager into his office, decorated with a
headless mannequin in a hula skirt, a "Jenny Jones" cookie jar and 50
plastic baby dolls hanging on the wall behind his desk.</TE>
<TE>   "Bubble gum?" St. John said, digging into a jar of Double Bubble.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, please," Fernley replied in his most professional voice.</TE>
<TE>   Then they got down to business. St. John called in John Quinn, a
development associate, to pitch the teenager an idea for an
unscripted TV show.</TE>
<TE>   "This is big," Quinn said, diving into details of the project
involving formerly incarcerated, nonviolent criminals finding their
true loves.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, it's a good idea," Fernley said. "I bet you could go to
Kentucky and find lots of people for the show."</TE>
<TE>   "Now, you make [Quinn] feel uncomfortable," St. John half-jokingly
advised his protege. "You say, 'I'll get back to you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Or, Fernley offered, "I can say, 'We'll do lunch.'"</TE>
<TE>   St. John smiled. How quickly they learn.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was off to the gritty set of "Street Smarts" at Victory
Studios in Glendale, where Fernley met Frank Nicotero, host of the
late-night show.</TE>
<TE>   It was on the set, surrounded by a gray platform, faux brick and
steel and microphones dangling from the ceiling, where Fernley
learned about contestant selection and location filming, where he
joked with the men as if they were equals and where he had an
epiphany.</TE>
<TE>   "I like how everyone is relaxed and having fun," Fernley said. "I
don't want to wear suits and work 9-to-5 in a cubicle.... I might
want to be an executive producer."</TE>

<HD>A 'She'll Love You Forever' Gift: Stripper Class</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Valentine's Day was fast approaching, and I couldn't think of what to
get for a special someone in my life. But lucky me, I opened The
Times and saw a story about a Hancock Park actress who teaches a
women's self-help course that sounded interesting.</LD>
<LD>   The class was about how to locate your inner strength while
stripping on a dance pole, either for personal enrichment or for the
man in your life.</LD>
<LD>   "Beautiful!" the instructor shouts as women pretend they're
stripping for their husbands. "He's dying. He's loving it."</LD>
<TE>   My first thought was that, as a gift, it beats a box of
chocolates.</TE>
<TE>   But I couldn't be sure how the lovely and talented Alison would
react if I enrolled her in the class as a Valentine's Day gift. It
isn't easy for a man to know what's up these days in the women's
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Take the recent stories about newswoman Greta Van Susteren. She
always struck me as smart, independent and un-Hollywood--the rare TV
personality who didn't look like a chirping bobble-head.</TE>
<TE>   But then I saw someone resembling her on the cover of People
magazine, sporting the "new look" that is "the talk of TV."</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, it was a virtually unrecognizable Greta, who spoke
of her face lift as if it were an act of courage and national
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made it safe for other people to have plastic surgery," she
said through a smile that might not have been an option.</TE>
<TE>   Feminism is dead, I thought. It's got to be safe to send your wife
to stripper school.</TE>
<TE>   As The Times' story reported in a tone generally reserved for
medical breakthroughs, women are on a waiting list to pay $50 for the
privilege of stripping to their skivvies and slithering up and down a
pole at the home of actress Sheila Kelley, who was on "L.A. Law."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, much like Greta Van Susteren, finds herself in a national
leadership role.</TE>
<TE>   Having produced a stripper movie called "Dancing at the Blue
Iguana," she is now a self-styled social scientist on a mission to
teach ordinary women the liberating, empowering effects of lap
dancing and pole dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how powerful I feel when I do it," purred Kelley, who
believes the dance pole belongs in the bedroom, not the go-go club.</TE>
<TE>   She said she paid real strippers to teach her their moves so she
could then heal sexually repressed housewives. "I know how sexy I
feel. I know how beautiful I look to me and to my husband, and that's
all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the husband, he's actor Richard Schiff, who plays the
White House flack on "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Given the Oval Office connection, I thought perhaps President
Clinton was going to pop up as a motivational speaker in the
pole-dancing class. No such luck, but Schiff volunteered that his
friends are envious when he tells them his wife likes to strip for
him.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus, he tells his friends? My wife gets upset if I tell someone
she squeezes the toothpaste tube from the top. But for some couples,
I guess discretion has gone the way of feminism.</TE>
<TE>   Schiff said he'll be changing his toddler's diapers and hear
hooting and hollering from his wife's class. It's certainly none of
my business, but I might start to wonder. Here you are, elbow deep in
poop, while housewives frolic in stiletto heels and teddies in the
back room, scissor-kicking around the maypole while your wife yells,
"Beautiful!"</TE>
<TE>   I was vaguely aware that people lived in a world I knew nothing
about, but I never would have guessed it was in button-down Hancock
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to read this story," I told my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "What story?"</TE>
<TE>   "The one about this actress who teaches pole dancing at her house,
and her husband is some guy on 'The West Wing' who goes around
telling friends his wife likes to strip for him. What do you think
about that?"</TE>
<TE>   "We gotta get out of this town," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where would you even get a pole like that?" I wondered.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't answer. She was muttering uncivil thoughts about women
who do dumb things for idiot men and then try to pass it off as
liberation.</TE>
<TE>   And so, playing it safe for Valentine's Day, I bought my wife a
nice card and some books about Tuscany, and I took her to dinner at a
romantic Italian cafe.</TE>
<TE>   When the time was right, I asked if she would have liked it if I'd
bought her a dancer's pole instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she said, surprising me. Must be the Chianti, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   "What would you have done on it?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have used it to swing around and kick you in the head."</TE>
<TE>   Lovely and talented, and too smart for me.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Is 7th Among State's Safest Small Cities</HD>
<DH>Crime: Incidents have dropped more than half since 1991 in
a town noted for good schools, culture and strong before- and
after-school recreation programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with California's enclaves for the rich and its well-armed
prison towns, the Ventura County bedroom community of Moorpark ranks
as one of the state's safest cities.</LD>
<LD>   The crime rate of Moorpark, a family-oriented community of 32,000
created during the 1980s, ranks seventh of 341 California cities with
at least 10,000 residents, according to an analysis of the FBI's
latest Uniform Crimes Reports.</LD>
<LD>   "Lots of police officers live here, and lots of firefighters, and
lots of families too," said Moorpark Mayor Patrick Hunter, a
lieutenant for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "The man
across the street is a policeman and the man moving in next door is a
fireman. We're interested in the same things everybody else is--a
safe community, good schools and little traffic."</LD>
<TE>   On a Metrolink line to Los Angeles and adjoining Simi Valley, the
safest large city in America, Moorpark has grown sixfold in two
decades, building expensive planned communities from peach and
apricot orchards and on the hillsides surrounding the agricultural
Tierra Rejada Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the affluent white-collar city ranks behind only the
exclusive San Francisco Bay Area communities of Hillsborough and
Moraga, the pricey Los Angeles County towns of San Marino, Sierra
Madre and Palos Verdes Estates--and Soledad, a Salinas Valley farm
community with a state prison as its main employer.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark ranks just ahead of Rancho Palos Verdes, oak-studded
Saratoga in the Silicon Valley and Avenal, a dusty prison town in the
San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The cities' crime rates reflect the ratio of population to eight
categories of crime--murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary,
theft, auto theft and arson.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI compiles crime totals each year for thousands of cities
and counties across the U.S. Its most recent report reflects crime in
the year 2000. Moorpark's crime report for 2001, released this week,
shows that crime has dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just a lot of good people here, trying to do the right
thing," said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Bob LeMay, who serves as
Moorpark's police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly effective, he said, are Moorpark school and city
recreation efforts that provide afternoon and evening programs, such
as athletics, and weekly dances called "Band Jams" that are
reminiscent of an earlier time.</TE>
<TE>   "But in fairness, you have to look at the composition of this
community," LeMay said. "We're largely a bedroom community. And you
tend to see a smaller crime rate in those kinds of areas."</TE>
<TE>   LeMay, who moved his family to Moorpark last year, said the
fast-growing city also benefits from good homes, churches, schools
and service organizations. "Healthy communities have all of those,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like neighboring Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks in eastern Ventura
County, Moorpark is a prime destination for disenchanted San Fernando
Valley residents seeking better schools and a manageable, small-town
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   They come to a spotless community known for its high school
Academic Decathlon team, its community college, cultural arts center
and quaint town center--but little else beyond strip malls and
industrial parks.</TE>
<TE>   There are few retail shops and no big-box stores, except Kmart.
The city's only movie theater is closed. That helps keep crime low,
officials say. Shopping malls often lure criminals, and entertainment
venues invite out-of-town visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look beyond the statistics," said Hunter, who was
born and raised in the San Fernando Valley and moved to Ventura
County in 1986. "We have a very low fear factor. We have joggers late
at night and early in the morning. People use the parks all the time.
While statistics can be misleading, the absence of fear is not."</TE>
<TE>   Sleepy Moorpark is getting safer all the time, bucking a state and
national trend of crime rates beginning to rise last year after a
decade of decline. Since 1991, Moorpark's crime rate has plummeted
from 22.8 per 1,000 residents, to 9.9 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting about a town our size, in a safe community
like ours," Hunter said, "is we have so few crimes that it enables us
to analyze each one to prevent a reoccurrence if it's a trend."</TE>
<TE>   LeMay said Paul Ferruzza, a deputy in his 26-officer city
department, works a special enforcement assignment to quash emerging
crime trends.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes to the hot spots and puts the fires out," LeMay said. "If
we're experiencing vehicle burglaries in an area, he'll [work in
plain clothes] and make it a project....If we're experiencing
tagging, as we did on occasion last year, we'll make that a project
and hold those people responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark once had a significant youth gang problem, but that has
abated, LeMay said. As a result, felony violence has dropped from 87
offenses in 1991 to 40 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Aggravated assault, a crime frequently linked to gang problems,
fell from 72 to 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have the major [gang] players in custody or they may have
moved out of the area," LeMay said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited diligent detective work by Sgt. Jim Bollington, who
tracks the whereabouts of gang members as a deterrent. Strict
enforcement of the terms of gang members' parole or probation also
helps keep them apart, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was done in the last year to turn this around," LeMay
said. "It's just been a continual thing to stay on top of it."</TE>

<HD>7-Eleven in Orange Cures Lotto Fever</HD>
<DH>Jackpot: It's chaos and celebration at O.C. store where one
of three tickets was sold. Winners are still unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sundays are usually boring for 7-Eleven store clerk Devinder Singh.
But Sunday, instead of watching coffee percolate and chitchatting
with customers at the store in Orange where he works, Singh had a
wild and noisy time. Someone there bought a winning Super Lotto
ticket worth $64.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   In the largest single state jackpot in U.S. history, three winning
tickets won the $193 million Saturday night. The tickets also were
bought at stores in Montebello and Half Moon Bay.</LD>
<LD>   None of the winners had been identified by state Lotto officials
by late Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of the usual, Singh spent his day being filmed by TV news
crews and talking to newspaper reporters and other media members who
had staked out the store. By late evening, Singh said no one had
claimed to be the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "There's many people here, but the winner hasn't shown up," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lotto officials descended on the store at 292 S. Main St. early
Sunday and informed Singh the store had sold one of the winning
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The store's owner, Harry Biasala, will receive about $321,666 as
his 5% retailer's share, said Nora Minas, lottery spokeswoman.
However, Biasala was in Las Vegas and wasn't expected back until
Monday, Singh said. For Singh, the Lotto results were bittersweet. He
bought three tickets himself, his usual dosage of Lotto fever.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day the atmosphere inside the store was circus-like
and festive. One couple who identified themselves as Felix Lapuz, a
veterinarian, and Jane Baumann said they bought Lotto tickets at
dozens of stores throughout Southern California to enhance their
chances. They entered the store like winners, witnesses said, but
then told everyone within earshot, they didn't know for sure.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Bennett, owner of the 7-Eleven in Montebello that sold a
winning ticket, hasn't decided how she and her husband will spend the
money they will receive for selling the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a nephew who would love to go to college," Bennett said.
"Then there's the employees. I've got struggling students and a
single mom working two jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Singh said Biasala knows his store sold a winning ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty ironic, don't you think?" Minas asked. "The jackpot
is here in California and he's in Las Vegas."</TE>

<HD>Breakfast at Riordan's Tough for Jones to Swallow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Riordan and Bill Simon are the millionaires, but Bill Jones'
campaign staff is making sure their guy gets his money's worth. After
Wednesday night's final GOP primary debate, the Jones team was
"spinning" its way through the pressroom at the Cal State Long Beach
campus where reporters watched the debate over a closed-circuit feed.</LD>
<LD>   Before the debate began, they handed around fortune cookies with
predictions--"Bill Jones, First Farmer elected California Governor,"
and the truly head-spinning "NRA endorsement propels Bill Jones to
victory on March 5."</LD>
<LD>   And before the microphones had even cooled off after the
debate--in which Riordan said the peacemaking post-election breakfast
could be held at his downtown L.A. restaurant--the Jones team was
ready: a press release headed "Why the unity breakfast should not be
held at the Pantry," pointing out that the we-never-close restaurant
was briefly closed in 1997 for health code violations.</LD>
<TE>   Not yet being served: the old-standby spin that surfaces in just
about every campaign, a fake political menu of issues served at the
opposing candidate's "waffle house."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate to PG&amp;E: Thanks, but No Thanks</TE>
<TE>   Remember the picture you saw here of Erin Brockovich, anti-toxic
crusader, giving her thumbs-up endorsement to Tom Umberg, a Democrat
running for state insurance commissioner?</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of that, PG&amp;E--the utility that Brockovich took on
over contaminated groundwater, the utility that filed for bankruptcy
protection last year--still had enough in the petty cash drawer to
give $10,000 to the campaign of Umberg's opponent, Tom Calderon.</TE>
<TE>   But Calderon, who said he didn't know about the contribution, sent
it back.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the bankruptcy, they shouldn't be giving
contributions," he said. "I haven't accepted energy contributions all
year."</TE>
<TE>   But his teller window is still open for insurance company
contributions: "I've been an open book about this. I'm accepting help
from a lot of people.... They've never attacked my voting record.
There's not one shred of evidence that I've favored the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Raising the Titanic as a Political Jab</TE>
<TE>   The Royal Mail Steamer Titanic, sunk by an iceberg in 1912, has
been refloated 90 years later as the ship of state--at least the
state of affairs for the California deregulation debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge's state Sen. Tom McClintock put it around last spring
that his fellow Republicans were joking, "What's the difference
between Gray Davis and the Titanic? When the Titanic went down, the
lights were still on." Richard Riordan, at the state GOP party
convention, repeated the quip.</TE>
<TE>   And at last week's U.S. Senate hearings on the flat financial
souffle that once went by the name of Enron, Jeff Skilling, Enron's
past-imperfect CEO, was quoted by Sen. Barbara Boxer as spreading the
joke across California: "And this is what he said on a conference
call: 'You know what the difference is between the state of
California and the Titanic? At least when the Titanic went down, the
lights were on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sound Body, Sound Mind, Sound of Silence</TE>
<TE>   Debate Day plus one found Bill Simon at Garfield High School in
East Los Angeles, to cut the ribbon for a new fitness center funded
by his family's Cindy L. and William E. Simon Foundation, which has
paid for fitness centers in seven Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   He told the Latino students that the program is based on an
ancient Greek principle of "sound body, sound mind"--a phrase he
repeated in Latin, mens sana incorpore sano.</TE>
<TE>   And he put a question to the students in the school gym: "Today's
the second day of Lent. What have you all given up?" (Simon, a devout
Catholic, is abstaining from sweets and meat for the duration.)</TE>
<TE>   The students were silent.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, Lent?" Simon prompted them. "In the Catholic Church?
Yesterday was Ash Wednesday ...?" No response.</TE>
<TE>   Simon trudged gamely on, admitting that he was a mediocre high
school student and athlete. "We want to recognize the kids who are
trying the best they can, and may not be the stars of the basketball
team," he said. "As far as we're concerned, every child is
important.... Everything is possible in California. I mean, if I can
run for governor, you guys can do anything, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe even bench-press your weight in gubernatorial candidates.</TE>
<TE>   One Democrat's Debt Reduction</TE>
<TE>   Last week we told you about state Sen. Steve Peace betting an
Enron lobbyist a year ago that Enron would be bankrupt within three
years, loser buys dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Now we can tell you that Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland, the
state party's one-man Panzer division, was seen trying to hand
uber-rich-guy Bill Simon a wad of cash on the very steps of the state
Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland had bet Simon a hundred bucks that he'd exit the race
by the end of 2001. Mulholland was paying off his debt--very
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's aides rushed to intercept the C-note. "They saw the
cameras and got nervous, so Simon told me to just donate it to a
church."</TE>
<TE>   Who's For Whom</TE>
<TE>   Davis: Democrats for Neighborhood Action, in the San Fernando
Valley; the Democratic Club of Pasadena Foothills.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: Asian Americans for Riordan Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Simon: California College Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Oops--among the elected elite introduced at a Town Hall Los
Angeles breakfast with First Lady Laura Bush were former gov Pete
Wilson, gov wanna-be Dick Riordan, L.A. City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo--and Leslie Irving, who had not only been booted off the
Compton City Council by a judge four days earlier in Compton's
election scandal, but was also ordered "forever disqualified" from
holding public office in California.</TE>
<TE>   * With former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani endorsing Bill Simon,
current N.Y. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Gov. George Pataki

lost in the mists of history, which in L.A. means anything older than
last year's best picture Oscar. LAPD commanders wear one star and
deputy chiefs wear two stars. Assistant chiefs wear three stars, but
there haven't been any of those since Parks became chief in 1997.
Baca's star advantage doesn't mean Parks has to salute him--the very
idea would infuriate the thin blue line.</TE>

<HD>Red Cars Are Back on Track</HD>
<DH>San Pedro: The trolley line will make its return after 40
years as a way to stimulate tourism around the Port of Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 40-year absence, Red Cars are making a return to San Pedro.</LD>
<LD>   Scheduled to begin operation by September, a 1.5-mile trolley line
will take passengers from the World Cruise Center to downtown San
Pedro, Ports O' Call Village and Cabrillo Marina. The revival of the
cars is an effort to stimulate tourism around the Port of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "There are 500,000 cruise passengers a year" at the World Cruise
Center at the port, said Bob Henry, project manager for the Port of
L.A. Waterfront Red Car Line. "The question was asked, 'How [do we]
get them out of the terminal to spend money in San Pedro?'"</LD>
<TE>   The answer that a citizens advisory committee came up with was to
resurrect the Red Cars, which crisscrossed the city and the port
community until they closed in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The trolley is an homage to mass transit's yesteryear, when
Pacific Electric Red Cars ran throughout Los Angeles. The hope is
that nostalgia and curiosity will attract local visitors and provide
a reason for cruise passengers to linger around the port and spend
their money.</TE>
<TE>   "What it will do is connect San Pedro's 'string of pearls,'" Henry
said, referring to the town's somewhat isolated tourist attractions.
The trolley's conductors will act as tour guides, telling stories
about the history of the Red Cars and giving information about the
port; Ports O' Call Village, a 15-acre, New England-style tourist
attraction; and the marina, which is home to 1,100 slips for small
boats.</TE>
<TE>   Once a bustling cluster of shops and restaurants, Ports O' Call
Village is a shadow of its former self. A decade ago, 98% of the
storefronts and restaurants were occupied. Currently, only about half
of the 71 units are filled.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to use the trolleys to attract tourists just might work,
said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at other cities that use heritage trolley lines, like
New Orleans and San Francisco--they found out it was not only viable
transportation, but interesting to tourists," Kyser said. "It will
appeal to local residents who are old enough to remember the old line
and also to outside tourists."</TE>
<TE>   The trolley line will feature two replica Red Cars and one
restored car that will run on the original tracks from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Fridays through Mondays, coinciding with prime arrival and
departure times for cruise ships. The cars will look historic but
will have modern machinery underneath.</TE>
<TE>   "There are regulatory demands and practical limitations we have to
consider," said John Smatlak, a railway preservation consultant who
is working on the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to ask, 'How do we capitalize on the flavor of a vintage
trolley with a modern vehicle?'"</TE>
<TE>   That meant installing new steel frames while preserving the
classic wooden exteriors.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cars will feature walkover seats, or seats that can be
flipped over to face whichever direction the trolley is moving. The
interior of the cars will be painted in authentic Red Car colors.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the trolley tracks, including replacing about 1,000 old
ties, was completed about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   A fare box will collect $1 from each passenger, which will entitle
him or her to unlimited rides within a period of several hours. But
officials don't expect that the Red Cars will be a moneymaker.</TE>
<TE>   "The fare box never gives back what you pay for it," Henry said.
"But it's a long-term investment in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Open houses are being held the first Saturday of each month so the
public can see the restored car and the two replicas as they are
being built at Berth 155A on Pier A Street in Wilmington.</TE>

<HD>Delgadillo Works Phones, Podiums to Raise Profile</HD>
<DH>Politics: City attorney says he's focused on present job,
but moves suggest he's looking at future campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only seven months into his first job as an elected official, Los
Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo is making moves that suggest he
has his sights on higher political office.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Delgadillo--who was virtually unknown before he ran
for city attorney a year ago--welcomed hundreds of Democrats meeting
for the state party convention in Los Angeles, stepping in as the
city's representative.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, as Mayor James K. Hahn announced that he would
oppose Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' reappointment, Delgadillo was
on the phone, calling a dozen African American officials and
community leaders from South Los Angeles to make sure they knew that
he was supporting Parks. For good measure, he even contacted the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who reciprocated by offering to help the city attorney
in any way he could.</LD>
<TE>   He has even taken a turn on the national stage, appearing several
weeks ago at the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting.
While sharing a stage with the governors of New Jersey and Virginia,
he told the DNC audience that he was proud to be the first Latino in
a century to win a citywide office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 41-year-old city attorney won't discuss his political
ambitions, his advisors are already talking privately about
Delgadillo running for a statewide position such as attorney general,
or perhaps the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm putting Rocky on my radar screen," said longtime Los Angeles
political watcher Steven Erie. "He's clearly looking toward a higher
office. The question is, what?"</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the speculation, Delgadillo said he is focused on his
current post.</TE>
<TE>   "There is one job I think about running for every day--the one I
have," he said. "I'm trying to become the best city attorney the city
has ever had. If I can do that, my future will take care of itself."</TE>
<TE>   Making City Attorney's Office More 'Activist'</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Delgadillo--who grew up in East Los Angeles and
attended Harvard University--has set an aggressive tone since he took
office in July. He gave a speech at USC in September promising to
make it a more "activist" office than it was under Hahn's lengthy
administration.</TE>
<TE>   He brought in outsiders with a wide range of experience and
impressive credentials. He hired Terree A. Bowers, a former federal
prosecutor, as chief deputy. He brought in former Police Commission
President Gerald L. Chaleff as one of his senior advisors. Delgadillo
also hired George Cardona, a UCLA law professor and former federal
prosecutor, to run the office's criminal division.</TE>
<TE>   While looking for ways to improve the office, his staff members
have also been on the lookout for political opportunities for their
boss. One of his special assistants had a contact at the Democratic
National Committee and suggested that Delgadillo be invited to
participate. That appearance led to an invitation to take a role in
this week's state convention.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by the staff changes, Delgadillo announced a number of
policy initiatives, including assigning prosecutors to some of the
city's most troubled neighborhoods to help residents crack down on
crime and blight.</TE>
<TE>   He also staked out a prominent role in the high-stakes debate over
billboards, calling for strict restrictions on the giant signs
although several companies donated more than $400,000 of free
advertising space on Delgadillo's behalf during his campaign. At a
council meeting last month, he urged city lawmakers to take steps to
eliminate billboards in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give him credit for seizing the moment," said veteran
political consultant Rick Taylor. "He's not afraid to jump out on
controversial issues."</TE>
<TE>   By jumping into the middle of the controversy over Parks'
reappointment, Delgadillo is reaching out to the African American
community that was vital to Hahn's election. Delgadillo endorsed
Parks from the pulpit of a South Los Angeles church--the day before
Hahn came out against the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso complained that
Delgadillo's endorsement has compromised the objectivity of his
office, which advises the Police Commission on legal matters. Caruso
said the commission will now be forced to hire outside counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what he's thinking, other than pure politics,"
Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said the commission will be able to rely on the city
attorney's office. He said he will erect "an ethical wall" in his
office and recuse himself from all matters regarding the chief's
appointment. He named Patricia Tubert, chief of the municipal counsel
branch, to act as city attorney on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Chilly Relationship With Mayor</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the mayor's office did not have
any comment on Delgadillo.</TE>
<TE>   Since Hahn and Delgadillo took office in July, their relationship
has been chilly.</TE>
<TE>   The two Democrats got off to a bad start in November when Hahn
invited all the Latino elected officials except Delgadillo on a trade
mission to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Delgadillo released a performance audit of the city
attorney's office that was critical of how it was run under Hahn.
Soon after, the mayor's aides fired back, criticizing Delgadillo for
proposing millions of dollars of new programs at a time of a growing
budget crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McOsker, the mayor's chief of staff, said that many of
Delgadillo's proposals could be accomplished by using current staff.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was city attorney, Mayor Hahn addressed these kinds of
issues many times," McOsker said at the time. "It just takes some
creative management."</TE>
<TE>   While Delgadillo may not have forged a strong relationship with
Hahn since taking office, he has strengthened his ties with members
of the city's African American community.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Frederick Murph, who received a call from Delgadillo in
the wake of Hahn's announcement on Parks, said he felt comforted by
his conversation with the city attorney. "He called to express his
concern, as well as to let me know that whatever he could do, he was
there for us," said Murph, a minister at Brookins AME Church in South
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo has strong ties to the city's black community. As
deputy mayor under Richard Riordan, he coordinated rebuilding efforts
in South Los Angeles after the riots. He was married by the Rev.
Cecil "Chip" Murray of the First AME Church. In last summer's
election campaign, basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson made a
television commercial for Delgadillo, who was carried into office by
strong support from African American and Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   At the DNC meeting in Washington, Delgadillo spoke of the need to
have cross-ethnic appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to winning elections, there is no longer an ethnic
majority in L.A.--or California, for that matter," Delgadillo said.
"To win elections in this new America, you must be able to reach
beyond narrow ethnic politics."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, he calls himself a "big dreamer" when it comes to
the path of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "All those [rumors] flatter me," he said. "But the biggest source
of new work is the work on my desk."</TE>

<DH>Anniversary: Current and former members and their friends
help Ventura Troop 102 celebrate its 80th year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retiree Curtis Ridling returned to Ventura on Sunday to mark his
former Scout troop's 80th anniversary and visit with old friends,
four decades after leaving the Boy Scouts.</LD>
<LD>   Wes Fish, scoutmaster for Troop 102, attended the event and
praised the organization's traditional values.</LD>
<LD>   And Vince Barraza, a 16-year-old Eagle Scout candidate, came to
show his appreciation for everything he has learned the last five
years.</LD>
<TE>   The trio joined 75 past, present and future members to celebrate
the milestone and to recognize the troop's longtime affiliation with
First United Methodist Church in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The celebration at the church's Trotter Hall included displays of
Scout memorabilia, several short speeches, lunch and a brief awards
ceremony during which several active Scouts received honors.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall having some great times," said Ridling, 65, of Santa
Barbara. "Some of my best friends are guys that I met here."</TE>
<TE>   A retired teacher, Ridling struck up conversations by sharing a
photograph of himself and other troop members making repairs at an
Ojai campground in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-member troop's actual anniversary was Dec. 21, but they
decided to celebrate this month because Feb. 8 marked the 92nd
birthday of the Boy Scouts of America.</TE>
<TE>   During the afternoon party, alumni and current members stood
together, raised their hands in the traditional three-fingered salute
and recited the Boy Scout oath.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to train young people," said Charles Brady, 81,
of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Brady, a former Troop 102 leader, was wearing a traditional Boy
Scout red wool coat with a patch stitched to the chest depicting a
black bull. He earned it 40 years ago as a scoutmaster.</TE>
<TE>   The badge is given to those who attend the rigorous Philmont
adventure camp in New Mexico, where Scouts still train in camping and
leadership skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Our kids could do anything," Brady said of the troop he led. "If
they had to build a tower for a badge, they could do it."</TE>

<LD>Former USC forward Brian Scalabrine, a rookie with the New Jersey
Nets, tried to bring something new to the NBA on Sunday--a game of
shirts and skins.</LD>
<LD>   After being told by Net Coach Byron Scott to enter the game at the
start of the second quarter, Scalabrine whipped off his warm-up top
to discover he had forgotten to put on his jersey.</LD>
<LD>   Scalabrine ran off the court at the Meadowlands to the Nets'
locker room. Less than a minute later, Scalabrine returned wearing
his No. 21 jersey, a sight that left Scott and his teammates
laughing. He entered the game at the next timeout.</LD>
<TE>   "I never did that in my life," said Net forward Keith Van Horn.
"That's not even a rookie mistake. It's just inexcusable. We're going
to give it to him for that."</TE>
<TE>   Scalabrine made a quick exit, without comment, from the arena
after the Nets' 98-77 victory against Denver.</TE>

national team forward Joe-Max Moore of Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Moore's team, Everton, played Crewe in an F.A. Cup
match whose kickoff time was changed at the request of the Rev. Harry
Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Ross, the local vicar, wanted his congregation to have time to go
to church.</TE>
<TE>   "I worship God first and Everton second," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit of divine intervention has taken place here, and
everyone is now happy," added an Everton spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Not entirely. Everton was tied, 0-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the minimum NFL salary for a 10-year veteran?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A curt answer: When the Houston Texans look over the possibilities
in today's NFL expansion draft, they can only hope not to repeat the
mistake the Cleveland Browns made in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   That was the year the Browns overlooked a quarterback made
available by the St. Louis Rams. His name? Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Culinary note: California's upset loss to Washington ended the
Bears' four-game winning streak, much to the displeasure of Coach Ben
Braun. Not that Braun ever appears happy on court.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Chronicle, Braun often
looks "like a plate of bad seafood was negotiating itself through his
digestive tract."</TE>
<TE>   Charming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do's and don'ts: Forced out of Salt Lake City by the Olympics,
Utah basketball Coach Rick Majerus and his players spent 10 days on
the road, five in Las Vegas and five in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent all my time telling the players, 'Don't,'" Majerus told
the Minneapolis Star Tribune's Patrick Reusse.</TE>
<TE>   "'Don't go in the casino, don't go in the sun, don't go to the
beach.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Greg Cote of the Miami Herald is not overwhelmed by
the Florida Marlins' new owner, New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria.</TE>
<TE>   "Loria's track record in two years as Montreal Expos owner is
something best left off a resume," Cote wrote. "The Expos averaged a
league-worst 7,500 fans last season. It is why they are doomed, set
to play one more season before crowds of 45,000 empty seats and then
be turned into the Ex-pos."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Word for Wise: Wait Goes On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The call of the wild was interrupted by the call of the cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Wise, on a duck-hunting trip, suspected the call might have
something to do with baseball. He wondered whether he had been
traded.</LD>
<LD>   No, he was still an Angel. So was Aaron Sele, as Wise found out
when he answered the call. And, the next day, Kevin Appier was an
Angel, too.</LD>
<TE>   When the Angels packed up for the winter, Wise believed his turn
would come in the spring. After two solid seasons as a triple-A
starter, Wise expected to join Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott
Schoeneweis in the Angel rotation. In September, General Manager Bill
Stoneman had said as much: "Matt is certainly ready to be here."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, little did Stoneman know that Disney ownership would
reverse its game plan and approve the $24 million signing of Sele.
And little did Stoneman know that he could get anything of value,
much less a consistent winner such as Appier, for disgruntled slugger
Mo Vaughn, who has not played in 17 months.</TE>
<TE>   "They're great additions for the ballclub," Wise said. "They're
proven studs. It would be one thing if they went out and got two
young pitchers, but these guys have been proven winners for a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   So in came Sele. In came Appier. And out of the rotation went
Wise, before he ever got in.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia, however, says he has not ruled Wise out of
a rotation that appears to have no openings.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is a major league pitcher," Scioscia said. "The five
we've got are pretty solid, but Matt Wise is definitely going to get
an opportunity to win a starting spot. At whose expense? We don't
really know."</TE>
<TE>   Wise, 26, would prefer not to return to triple-A Salt Lake City,
although the Angels might be best served with Wise starting there in
case of injury to one of the top five starters.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' camp is overflowing with experienced relievers, but
Wise would rather pitch in the bullpen--or do anything else in the
major leagues--than return to the Pacific Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work my way into starting here," Wise said, "whether it
be by being in the bullpen or sweeping the seats."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the defending American League West champion Seattle Mariners
opened camp, Seattle Manager Lou Piniella picked his team to win the
division again.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia declined to project the Angels as division winners but
said his team expected, not just hoped, to contend for the title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're definitely going to contend," Scioscia said. "You
want to come to spring training knowing you're going to be in a
pennant race and that you can succeed in a pennant race. I'm very
confident with the way we match up with the other clubs in our
division, and in the league."</TE>

<HD>Carson Player an Inspiration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Marques Washington knows about the ordeal that nearly claimed his
life is what he has been told.</LD>
<LD>   He was sitting with a friend on the hood of a cousin's car after
being dropped off for a basketball game. The boys on the hood
playfully told the cousin to drive. The car lurched forward, slow at
first, then faster. The cousin made a sharp turn.</LD>
<LD>   That's when Washington went flying off the hood backward, landing
headfirst on the pavement and suffering a violent seizure. Last rites
were issued at the hospital, where the boy slipped into a coma and
nearly died.</LD>
<TE>   Six years later, Washington is serving as an inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The Carson High senior guard has made a triumphant return to the
hardwood even though his right eye is permanently damaged and a scar
on the back of his head serves as a constant reminder of the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel normal," Washington said. "I feel like every day I'm
getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Washington scored 10 points Friday in the Colts' 57-48 victory
over Woodland Hills Taft and hopes to make an even bigger impact
Wednesday as Carson (18-7) takes on top-seeded Westchester (25-2) in
the quarterfinal round of the City Section playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has only played in two games since turning an ankle
against Washington in the Colts' second Marine League game, but his
spirit remains undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's my turn to be the man and take charge," said Washington,
Carson's second-leading scorer before the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Few thought Washington would play again after the car accident
left the eighth-grader in a coma for a week.</TE>
<TE>   His recovery has been slow. Confined to a wheelchair, Washington
was home-schooled for several months before attending Long Beach
Jordan for the rest of the ninth grade. He started the 10th grade at
Carson, where he joined the basketball team and played for three
seasons. In September, City Section officials granted him another
year of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Colt Coach Richard Masson said Washington's recuperation has been
remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "To come back and play at this level of competition again is
something," Masson said. Washington remains close to the cousin who
drove the car at the time of the accident. When Washington suffered
his seizure, it was the cousin who made sure that he did not swallow
his tongue.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't look at it like it was his fault," Washington said of
his cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Washington may never recover full vision in his right eye, but the
important thing is that he says he feels "110%."</TE>
<TE>   Moving on: Laguna Hills Coach Dave Brown announced last spring
that this season would be his last, giving him plenty of time to
contemplate his farewell speech. Somehow, though, the anticipatory
move didn't make saying goodbye to his players any easier Wednesday
after the Hawks were eliminated by La Habra Sonora, 58-39, in a
Southern Section Division II-A first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 59, spent the day thinking about how it would be the last
time he would wake as a coach, board the team bus and address his
players. The third-winningest coach in Orange County history almost
seemed resigned to the fact that the Sonora game would be his last.</TE>
<TE>   Sonora coaches made no such assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   "When we looked at the brackets, we said we did not want to play
Laguna Hills because of [Brown] and the way he always has his team
prepared," said Sonora assistant Mark McGarry.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sonora Coach Mike Murphy: "We hated to be the ones to play
him. I have so much respect for him. The way he runs his team and
program is just awesome. There's nobody in Orange County I respect
more."</TE>
<TE>   Sonora out-shot and out-defended undermanned Laguna Hills en route
to victory. Afterward, Brown, who finished his 33-year coaching
career with 527 victories, said he was pleased with the effort of his
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this group," he said. "They got everything out of their
ability."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who spent his first 20 years coaching at Fountain Valley
before moving to Laguna Hills, never took a team past the
quarterfinal round of the playoffs. Yet, he is one of four Orange
County coaches to record at least 500 victories, a testament to his
longevity. Only retired Anaheim Katella Coach Tom Danley (618) and
Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight (600) have more victories.</TE>
<TE>   "After coaching this long, [retirement] had to happen some time,"
said Brown, who has planned a move to Oregon after the school year.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though there was never any time to be sentimental, I knew I
was retiring and was working up to it."</TE>
<TE>   Good point: La Puente Bishop Amat Coach Ray Lokar's complaint that
his Lancers, the fourth-seeded team in Division III-AA, drew an
unusually tough first-round opponent became moot after Bishop Amat
knocked off Monrovia, 62-59.</TE>
<TE>   But Lokar's beef was legitimate. He felt his Lancers shouldn't
have been matched against a Monrovia team that was more dangerous
than its subpar record indicated, especially considering the Wildcats
were getting star forward Bryant Markson back from an extended injury
layoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way the playoffs work is if you face increasingly
difficult competition as each round goes on," Lokar said. "This
matchup should have happened in a later round."</TE>
<TE>   Lokar said the section committee that draws up the playoff
brackets needs to include someone with more expertise in each
division. But Paul Castillo, the section's assistant commissioner who
oversees boys' basketball, said the committee did its job.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules for bracketing were followed as they needed to be,"
Castillo said. "[Lokar] got a tough contest, he's correct. But there
were other first-round contests that were probably equally tough."</TE>
<TE>   Odds and tip-ins: Compton Dominguez's bid for a fourth consecutive
state title ended Friday when the Dons lost to Apple Valley, 51-48,
in a Division III-AA second-round game. ... Huntington Beach Edison
desperately missed center Tommy Grady, one of the leading
shot-blockers in Southern California, Friday during its 54-44 loss to
Rowland in a Division I-A first-round game. The 6-foot-6 junior was
out for a second consecutive game because of a sore ankle. UCLA
football Coach Bob Toledo might be pleased to know that Grady, one of
the hottest quarterback recruits in the country, wore a Bruin cap
while he sat on the bench in street clothes. But Edison football
Coach Dave White cautioned that the recruiting process is just
beginning. "He's got a million places to choose from," White said.
"It's a little early for him to tip his hat."</TE>

<LD>No last-minute collapse. Not even a home loss.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland finally beat Duke in Cole Field House at College Park,
Md.--the venerable building again the site of a loss by a No. 1 team.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 3-ranked Terrapins, who had lost four years in a row at
home to Duke, defeated the top-ranked Blue Devils, 87-73, before
14,500 on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   It was the seventh time a top-ranked team lost in the building
that is closing after this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game you play here is special because it's the last year
here," said Maryland Coach Gary Williams, whose team is 13-0 at home.
"The situation makes it special. You don't put special emphasis on it
with your players because what if you lose?"</TE>
<TE>   Williams didn't do a good job of selling that attitude to his
players.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole week the coach has been uptight on us about Duke. Duke
this, Duke that," said sophomore Chris Wilcox, who had a career-high
23 points. "I just feel better for my coach because Coach wanted this
win more than we did."</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins, 21-3 overall and 11-1 in the Atlantic Coast
Conference, made sure there was no heartache like last season's 98-96
overtime loss to Duke after blowing a 10-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland made it nearly impossible to blow a lead this time, going
ahead by 25 points three times</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Boozer had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Duke (23-2, 11-2).
The Blue Devils had won 11 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "The team that should have won did win, and they won in convincing
fashion," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   Rutgers 64, No. 13 Miami 61--Jerome Coleman scored a career-high
30 points at Piscataway, N.J., and the Scarlet Knights (17-8, 7-5 in
the Big East) defeated a ranked team for the fourth time this season.
Darius Rice scored 21 points for Miami (21-5, 8-5).</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Wake Forest 92, No. 15 Virginia 70--Darius Songaila made 11
of 13 shots and scored a career-high 30 points at Winston-Salem,
N.C., and the Demon Deacons (18-8, 8-4 in the ACC) ended a losing
streak at four against ranked teams. Roger Mason Jr. scored a
career-high 31 points for Virginia (16-7, 6-6).</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Indiana 75, Michigan 55--Jarrad Odle, Jeff Newton and Kyle
Hornsby each scored 17 points at Ann Arbor, Mich., and the Hoosiers
(17-8, 9-3) pulled into a first-place Big Ten tie with Ohio State.
Michigan is 10-14 and 5-8.</TE>

<HD>Healthy Approach Is Priority for Gentry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers took it easy Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry didn't want to put any more stress on his
banged up team than absolutely necessary during its practice at L.A.
Southwest College. So, the Clippers shot a few baskets and worked on
a few low-impact drills to prepare for tonight's game against the
Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We're hoping we'll find a chance to recover a little bit," Gentry
said. "We'll probably just take the whole day off Tuesday."</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers probably will skip practice and fly Tuesday to Miami
to begin a five-game trip Wednesday against the much-improved Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles, a reserve forward, was the latest to suffer an
injury. He banged his right forearm on the rim during the Clippers'
victory Saturday against the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Miles and forward Corey Maggette, who has been nursing a sore left
knee for most of two months, are expected to play tonight. The status
of reserve guard Quentin Richardson, who sprained his left foot at
practice Friday, will be determined at game time. Richardson did not
play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Gentry believes it will be some time before backup
point guard Keyon Dooling regains his form. Dooling, who has played
limited minutes in two games after being sidelined since Nov. 14 by a
sprained left ankle, can't yet go at full speed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still got a ways to go," Gentry said of Dooling, who had two
points in five minutes Saturday. "He's going on adrenaline right now.
It's still going to take time before he gets his shot back."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Portland</TE>
<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>

<TE>   Records--Clippers 26-27, Trail Blazers 27-24.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Trail Blazers--1-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Clippers end a three-game home stand tonight, then hit
the road to play Miami, Orlando, Indiana, Memphis and Houston in a
pivotal trip. The Clippers defeated Dallas and lost to the San
Antonio Spurs in their first two games after the All-Star break. The
Clipper-Trail Blazer series has been lopsided this season. Portland
won the last meeting Jan. 19 by 113-93 after leading by 38 points at
one point in the second half. The Trail Blazers also won, 119-101, in
November. The Clippers took a 112-97 victory Jan. 1 from Portland.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Intimate Portrait: Kristi Yamaguchi"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Lifetime, Tuesday, 7-8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the gold medal in women's figure skating
at the 1992 Winter Olympics, has never had a knee whacked or been
involved with anyone who would do such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't any dark corners in Yamaguchi's life. There have been
no real tragedies, although she took the death of her grandfather and
the death of one of her coaches of cancer fairly hard.</TE>
<TE>   There are no scandals, no dirt. Yamaguchi comes from a good
family. She has a pleasing personality and says all the right things.
She might be considered a boring topic for a one-hour documentary.
But Lifetime has chosen to feature Yamaguchi at a time when women's
figure skating comes to the forefront at the Winter Olympics, and
she's not a bad choice.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaguchi's life is traced from the beginning, when she was born
on July 12, 1971, in the Bay Area. As a baby, she had club feet and
had to wear casts to straighten them out.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, Carole and Jim, are interviewed at length. Others
interviewed include her brother and sister, former skating partner
Rudy Galindo, friends Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano, longtime
coach Christy Ness, and husband Bret Hedican.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaguchi's relationship with Hedican is one of the more
interesting aspects of her life. The couple actually met at the 1992
Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, where Hedican was a member of
the U.S. hockey team. But their relationship didn't blossom until
they met again in Vancouver in 1995, when Yamaguchi was touring with
"Stars on Ice" and Hedican was playing for the Vancouver Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   They were married in 1999 and currently have a long-distance
relationship. Yamaguchi still tours with "Stars on Ice" and Hedican
plays for the Carolina Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaguchi's story is an uplifting one. It's about a young person
who had dreams that came true.</TE>

<HD>This Daytona 500 Is a Ward Winner</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Burton evades numerous wrecks in race and
edges Sadler, Bodine at finish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Blocking, the newest buzzword of NASCAR Winston Cup racing, helped
make Sunday's Daytona 500 one of the wildest and most confusing of
its 44 years.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Gordon called it "a crazy race," and that was a crazy
understatement.</LD>
<LD>   The winner was Ward Burton, a slow-talking Virginian driving a
Caterpillar Dodge who started 19th and was never near the lead most
of the day because (1) his car wasn't fast enough to get there, and
(2) he was not involved in blocking.</LD>
<TE>   Burton never led until the final five laps and that was because
Sterling Marlin, the leader in another Dodge, was penalized for
getting out of his car and tugging on his fender while the race was
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, the defending Winston Cup champion, was the driver most
involved in blocking. Once when he was being blocked, and once when
he was the blocker.</TE>
<TE>   The two incidents together wrecked 20 of the 43 cars which started
the Great American Race before a capacity crowd of 225,000 on a sunny
picture-postcard day at Daytona International Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why Burton won, young Elliott Sadler was second in a Ford
and comeback veteran Geoff Bodine was third in another Dodge. Sadler
started 41st on a Wood Brothers provisional and Bodine, who lay near
death here two years ago after a horrifying accident in a truck race,
came from 35th.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was shadowing Kevin Harvick in a battle of Chevrolets close
behind Marlin at lap 150. When Gordon made his move to try and pass
Harvick, the Bakersfield driver blocked his effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Gordon wanted in the same spot I did and I tried to block," said
Harvick, last year's rookie of the year. "He came up and all hell
broke loose. That's the one downfall of this restrictor-plate
package. You have to block, because if you get hung out you have to
go to the back and start all over again. I came down, we got
together, and I wrecked."</TE>
<TE>   So did 14 other cars which were sweeping through the 31-degree
banking heading out of the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gordon: "I was getting knocked from behind and pushed and
shoved. I was trying to stay in line and I gave Kevin a little push
and he got up beside the 40 [Marlin] car and then he decided to come
back down and I just kinda held my line. I was trying to back down
and let him back in, actually. So we touched and it spun him."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon's car was not damaged and he continued his pursuit of
Marlin in a duel of two-time Daytona 500 winners.</TE>
<TE>   Eight laps from the finish, with Jeff Gordon and Marlin leading a
pack of six cars, Robby Gordon spun in the second turn, slammed into
the wall and brought out the race's eighth caution flag. It took
three laps to clean up the debris.</TE>
<TE>   When the green flag came out on Lap 195, it triggered one of the
most bizarre incidents in Daytona history.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin appeared to slow in hopes of making a run at Gordon on the
high banks and it caused a five-car pileup behind him. Defending
champion Michael Waltrip got bumped and careened across the tri-oval
grass, missing the pace car by about a foot. Five other cars slid and
crashed as they crossed the start-finish line.</TE>
<TE>   But the real drama was happening a few hundred yards down the
racing strip where Marlin was trying to overhaul Gordon and Jeff
tried to block him.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Gordon who was the loser. At least it seemed that
way.</TE>
<TE>   "He had momentum on me and came up on the inside and I should have
just given up and taken my chances on getting by him later," said
Gordon. "I hated to see that last caution come out. Unfortunately,
Sterling got the jump on me. I tried to block him and messed up both
of our days."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin continued around and led Burton, Stadler and Bodine to the
finish line, thinking he had won his third Daytona 500, but NASCAR
officials threw a red flag, halting the race and stopping the cars on
the backstretch.</TE>
<TE>   This is where it got even more bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin climbed out of his car, checked the fender where he had
bumped Gordon and tried to pull it away from the tire.</TE>
<TE>   This was illegal and NASCAR stunned the Dodge team by forcing
Marlin to go to the rear of the line for the restart.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Dale Earnhardt do it at Richmond one time, I figured it was
OK," said Marlin. "On the restart, I laid back and got a run on Jeff
and got up on his corner panel. We hooked bumpers, he got sideways
and I went on."</TE>
<TE>   This put Burton, eldest of the racing brothers from South Boston,
Va., who had been sitting quietly in his Dodge, in front when racing
resumed after 19 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After two laps behind the pace car, the green flag signaled a
three-lap sprint for the biggest prize in stock car racing. Burton
held on, helped by the racing behind him where Sadler moved into
second past Bodine.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we had some luck," said Burton in victory lane. "We were
just in the right place at the right time. We got passed as many
times today as we passed. We had to give and take. A lot of guys had
a lot more steam than we had.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just biding our time. Fortunately, our car ran better on
older tires. We just tried real hard to be careful.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one close call when the 24 [Jeff Gordon] and the 29
[Harvick] got together and we were very fortunate to miss that
accident."</TE>
<TE>   Several pre-race favorites went out early with a variety of
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart, winner of last Sunday's Budweiser Shootout, lasted
only two laps before he pulled his Pontiac into the garage with a
blown engine.</TE>
<TE>   "The engine laid down on the start a little, then as the lap went
on it laid down even more," said Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I didn't cause a wreck trying to get off the track. I
had to go down the banking to the bottom of the track. I'm glad
everybody got by clean."</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr., winner of Saturday's Busch series race, cut a
tire on Lap 12. When the tire blew coming into the tri-oval, it broke
off the brake caliper and Earnhardt had to make four pit stops
without losing a lap while crew chief Tony Eury Jr. made repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to weld it because NASCAR won't allow you go run with
three calipers, you have to have four," Eury said.</TE>
<TE>   After getting repaired, Jr. drove the fastest lap of the race,
191.567 mph, before losing more time in the pits after being
collected in the Gordon-Harvick accident. He finished 29th.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Marcis, competing in a record 33rd Daytona 500, finished 42nd
but added another record to the history books when he completed 79
laps to move ahead of Richard Petty for the most laps driven in the
500. Marcis has 4,938, Petty 4,860.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The Violation</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Marlin, in the lead with three laps to go, got out of his
car to adjust his car fender during a red flag--a violation. When
racing resumed, Marlin was sent to the end of the field, giving Ward
Burton the lead he never relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 10-5 of the 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series rulebook
preventing any repairs on a car during a red flag:</TE>
<TE>   Red Flag--The red flag means that the race must be stopped
immediately regardless of the position of the cars on the track. The
red flag shall be used if, in the opinion of NASCAR officials, the
race should be stopped. Cars should be brought to a stop in an area
designated by NASCAR officials. Repairs or service of any nature or
refueling will not be permitted when the race is halted due to a red
flag. All work must stop on any car in the pits and/or garage area
when the red flag is displayed, unless the car has withdrawn from the
event. Work cannot be resumed until the red flag is withdrawn (race
is restarted).</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Was it whining or sandbagging? Whichever, complaints from Ford and
Dodge about the GM advantage during Daytona 500 SpeedWeeks paid off
in Sunday's race.</LD>
<LD>   After only two Fords qualified in the top 20, NASCAR officials cut
a quarter-inch off their rear spoiler last Sunday to improve their
aerodynamics. Then, after watching Chevrolets and Pontiacs dominate
the Budweiser Shootout and Twin 125 races, NASCAR responded by
cutting another quarter-inch off both Ford Taurus and Dodge Intrepid
entries on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   When Saturday's practice was rained out, if left all manufacturers
curious as to what effect the reduction would create--if any.</LD>
<TE>   "Our engineers estimate a quarter-inch is worth two-tenths of a
second a lap," said Mike Helton, NASCAR president.</TE>
<TE>   The results were obvious. Dodges and Fords claimed seven of the
first eight finishing positions in the Daytona 500 and one or the
other led for 106 of the 200 laps.</TE>
<TE>   The first Chevrolet--after having the top three and eight of the
top 10 in qualifying--Sunday was fifth-place Michael Waltrip and the
first Pontiac was Johnny Benson Jr. in 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Second-place finisher Elliott Sadler and sixth-place Mark Martin
didn't even qualify, starting from the rear with provisional
invitations.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like our teams were able to take advantage of the rules
change," understated Bob Wildberger, manager of Dodge's NASCAR
operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the playing field was level today. I've got to believe
that Ward Burton and [team owner] Bill Davis have got a start on that
million dollar bounty we've got for the driver's championship this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge announced Saturday it would pay $1 million to any of its
drivers who won the Winston Cup crown.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Wallace spoke for the Ford contingent when he said, "The
rule change really helped the Fords in the race, there's no doubt
about that. We were competitive with the Chevrolets and everybody, we
just didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pole-sitter Jimmie Johnson, after getting shuffled back as far as
35th because of inexperience, came back to finish 15th, the
second-highest-finishing rookie. Ryan Newman, a rookie with Roger
Penske's Ford team, was seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "It was crazy," said Johnson, a former off-roader from El Cajon.
"We were caught up in that first big wreck. Luckily we didn't get a
lot of damage but we got a quarter panel bent in which the 09
[Geoffrey Bodine] bumped me and it cut the tire. While we worked on
the car we got caught down a lap and that put us behind."</TE>
<TE>   Shawna Robinson, the second woman to drive in the Daytona 500,
finished 24th as the third rookie in the race and was not pleased
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "We finished in the top 25 and we're not thrilled about that but
at the same time we finished the Daytona 500 and got it out of the
way and now we can move on to racing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were in the mix of it all we held our own. I think I
showed that I don't have any problem running three wide or going high
or going low or doing whatever it takes. I think that was something I
needed to show today. I think I'm a pretty smart driver and I know
how to drive a race car and that's something I needed to prove
today."</TE>
<TE>   Janet Guthrie finished 12th in 1977 and 11th in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burton's win was the first for a Dodge since Richard Petty won the
1974 race.</TE>

<HD>Recovery Is the Big Test for Brown and Ashby</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It wasn't so much the arm strength that Tim Belcher missed; it was
that zip at the end of his pitches, that finishing snap of his
fingers that gave his fastball late movement.</LD>
<LD>   Belcher, the former Angel pitcher, underwent surgery to repair a
torn flexor muscle in his throwing elbow in early December, 1999, the
same procedure Dodger pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby are
recovering from this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Like Brown and Ashby, doctors gave Belcher, who was 38 at the
time, a five-month recovery window. But Belcher had numerous setbacks
in 2000, he opened the season on the disabled list and remained there
until June 17.</LD>
<TE>   After a two-week stint in the big leagues, Belcher returned to the
disabled list on July 3 and wasn't activated again until Sept. 8. He
went 4-5 with a 6.86 earned-run average in nine starts that season
but was never the same. He retired last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "My velocity was adequate, but there was no life on the ball when
it got to the plate," said Belcher, who now works in the Cleveland
Indians' front office. "That's what I lacked post-surgery. How much
of that was a product of the procedure and how much of it was age, I
don't know. But the act of finishing a pitch is where I'd be
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing Brown and Ashby are "workout fanatics," knowing the two
right-handers are in excellent shape, Belcher believes both will
recover fully. The Dodgers, backed by the opinion of team physician
Frank Jobe and physical therapist Pat Screnar, are confident both
will be ready for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "But you're always concerned when a player has surgery, because
you never know what's going to happen," General Manager Dan Evans
said. "We're hoping the organization is lucky and both are OK, but we
believe they're going to be OK because of the respect we have for the
people giving us that information. They've had a solid history of
being right."</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old Ashby, who has two years and $15.5 million
remaining on his contract, had surgery June 15, so he is seven months
into the recovery process. But Brown, who will turn 37 on March 15
and has four years and $60 million left on his contract, had surgery
Sept. 27, putting him only 41/2 months into rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger reliever Jesse Orosco, who turns 45 in April, had the same
procedure in 2000, and although he was pitching five months later, he
said it took 11 months for him to return to full strength.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming back in four months is pretty ambitious," Orosco said.
"Kevin has to look at himself ... sometimes you have to bite your
lip. If it takes a couple extra weeks to get ready, you might need a
couple extra weeks. The most important thing is to not go out and
pitch too early and end up back on the DL."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are aware of Brown's stubbornness when it comes to
injuries--the ace felt he could pitch the 2001 season opener despite
an Achilles' tendon strain that forced him to the DL--and they plan
to monitor him closely.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very aggressive procedure he had, and it was the first
time he's had [arm] surgery," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He's a very
intelligent man and will know his limitations. If he needs to back
off, he will. We will not push him to the point where we lose him for
a period of time. We're going to take it very slow."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who is expected in camp today or Tuesday, has been throwing
vigorously for a few weeks, but he won't throw off a mound until
later this week. Ashby threw off the mound five times before
reporting to camp, throwing fastballs and sinkers only, and has had
two bullpen sessions in the last three days.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels fine now, but the main thing is to mix in curveballs and
the rest of my pitches," Ashby said. "Hopefully I'll stay away from
the one pitch that irritates it. Right now, I couldn't feel better.
I'm just trying to build my arm strength."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy is encouraged by Ashby's velocity, the depth of his sinker
and the freedom with which he is throwing. Ashby hasn't aired out his
fastball yet, but from his pre-camp bullpen sessions with minor
league instructor Travis Barbary and his bullpen sessions in camp,
he's pleased with the feel of his pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Travis said my pitches seemed to have more life, so who knows,
maybe they put some extra parts in me," Ashby said. "When I'm on the
mound, I'm not going to be thinking about getting hurt. As far as
finishing pitches, I've felt pretty good throwing 95% so far."</TE>
<TE>   Belcher felt the mental hurdles of overcoming surgery were as
difficult as the physical ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin and Andy take great care of themselves, so the physical
aspects of the comeback should be fine; the X-factor is the mental,"
Belcher said. "It's human nature. The flexor tendon can be a real
sensitive area, and it's hard to do something that hurts so much the
last time you did it.... These things are hard to predict."</TE>
<TE>   Like several players from the Dominican Republic this winter, a
discrepancy in a birth certificate caused visa problems for pitcher
Odalis Perez, who arrived in camp Sunday afternoon and will join the
Dodgers for workouts today.</TE>
<TE>   But Perez, acquired with Brian Jordan from Atlanta in January's
Gary Sheffield trade, was not found to be two or three years older or
younger than his listed age of 23; he was only five days younger.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born June 11, 1978, but when the Braves did my contract,
they made a mistake and used June 6," Perez said. "Even though it was
only a five-day difference, I had to get a new passport and birth
certificate, and that took a week."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who will compete with Omar Daal and Eric Gagne for the
fifth rotation spot, won't be set back by his late arrival; the
left-hander started 17 games for his Dominican Winter League team,
including two in the recently completed Caribbean World Series, and
has already built up plenty of arm strength and endurance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first graded stakes victory of Favorite Funtime's career was
Sunday's Grade I Santa Maria Handicap, which the 5-year-old mare won
by a head under a front-running ride from Gary Stevens at Santa
Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Verruma, at 25-1 the longest shot on the board, finished second, a
length ahead of favored Printemps, who was making her first start in
almost three months. Spain, the 2000 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner,
was fourth as her losing streak reached nine.</LD>
<LD>   Favorite Funtime, bred and owned by John and Betty Mabee of Golden
Eagle Farm and trained by Bob Baffert, paid $12.40 as the fourth
choice in a seven-horse field. She ran 11/16 miles in 1:44. Favorite
Funtime had won five of 11 starts, including two victories in
ungraded stakes, entering the Santa Maria.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Richard Mandella said that Kudos might run in the
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 2 after the 5-year-old
gelding won the $82,575 San Marino Handicap, a race moved from grass
to the dirt after an early rain.</TE>
<TE>   Kudos, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, beat Lord Jim by a
half-length with Beat Hollow, the 3-5 morning-line favorite, having
been scratched. Kudos, running 11/4 miles--the Big 'Cap distance--in
2:021/5, paid $4.80 as the favorite. It was his first victory in
three starts on dirt and his first race in 21/2 months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Repent, one of the early favorites for the Kentucky Derby, closed
impressively from the far outside at the Fair Grounds to win the
$150,000 Risen Star Stakes by 21/4 lengths over Bob's Image.
Easyfromthegitgo, who had won three in a row, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Tony D'Amico, favored Repent paid $3.40, running 11/16
miles in 1:43. The son of Louis Quatorze made his 2002 debut, after
winning three of five starts--and finishing second to Johannesburg in
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile--last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ken McPeek, who trains Repent, ran second with another of his
Derby prospects Saturday when Harlan's Holiday was nosed out by
Booklet in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Lumpkins rode the winners of five races in a row--the third
through the seventh--at Golden Gate Fields. Lumpkins' streak ended
when Power To Burn ran second in the eighth race, and in another bid
for No. 6 he finished off the board with Mountain Royalty in the last
race. The first of Lumpkins' winners was Fertile, who won the Vallejo
Stakes.</TE>

<HD>Astra Returns Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Astra did while being trained by Simon Bray was win eight of 11
races, including the Grade I Gamely Breeders' Cup and Beverly Hills
handicaps at Hollywood Park, a Grade II and a Grade III, and
$620,424.</LD>
<LD>   Today, we'll see how the 6-year-old Theatrical mare fares for a
new trainer.</LD>
<LD>   Astra, who is owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson, will
make her first start for Laura De Seroux in the $150,000 Buena Vista
Handicap at Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   A winner in two previous starts at Santa Anita, Astra is the 9-5
morning-line favorite as she makes her first appearance since
finishing last as the 7-10 favorite over a soggy turf course in the
Beverly D. last Aug. 18 at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   In her career, Astra has shown the ability to run without the
benefit of racing. She broke her maiden at first asking at Hialeah as
a 3-year-old, and on April 14, she returned after not racing more for
than nine months to win the Santa Barbara Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The one concern is that the Buena Vista is only a mile and Astra
has never won a race at less than 11/16 miles. In fact, this will be
her first start in a race shorter than 81/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   With Paga scratched Sunday morning, 10 are expected to challenge
Astra. Her main rivals are Old Money, who won her U.S. debut for
trainer Ron McAnally last month after winning five of 11 in
Australia, and Veil Of Avalon.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by John Newsome and trained by Christophe Clement, Veil Of
Avalon has won seven of 18 in her career.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth drew a full field of 12 going 11/8
miles on the turf. .</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bruce Headley. The trainer moved into fourth place in
the trainer's standings with 11 winners entering Sunday's program.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's sixth at Golden Gate Fields. The
11 maiden fillies entered in the six-furlong event are winless in 81
races.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  An exacta box in the fifth using Modest Man,
Speedy Pick and Spacelink.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/117. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $21.40/$717. Total money bet: $680.</TE>

<HD>Walker Injures Elbow</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker had a smile on his face as he headed out of the Laker
locker room at the Rose Garden on Sunday clutching a large envelope.</LD>
<LD>   In it were X-rays showing that the injury that had forced the
Laker center out of Sunday's 111-105 loss to the Portland Trail
Blazers in the fourth quarter was nothing more serious than a
hyperextended elbow.</LD>
<LD>   Walker, who has never had that injury even though it is common to
the sport, will get an MRI exam today as a precautionary measure.</LD>
<TE>   Walker was hurt when he locked arms with Portland's Shawn Kemp.</TE>
<TE>   "He got me with the [veteran] move," Walker said. "It's sore as
hell now, but they tell me I'll feel a whole lot better tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Walker had a tough game. He was 0 for 2 from the field in 22
minutes with two points and three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how Walker feels today, he knows his playing time will
be drastically reduced with the expected return of center Shaquille
O'Neal for Tuesday night's game at Staples Center against the Boston
Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has missed the last five games because of his chronic toe
injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk about adding insult to injury.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Kemp, who had 10 points in 18 minutes when he wasn't
busy locking arms with Walker, Laker Coach Phil Jackson said, "He
needs to lose about 10 more pounds."</TE>
<TE>   Kemp's own coach, Maurice Cheeks, naturally heaped praise on Kemp,
who scored several key baskets down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really pleased for Shawn Kemp," Cheeks said. "He became our
go-to guy in the fourth quarter when they had [Mark] Madsen guarding
him. We didn't think Madsen could guard him and Madsen did get in
foul trouble."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Along with Robert Horry (22 points), Rick Fox and Lindsey Hunter
(18 each) also had season-high scoring totals. Horry's previous best
had been 14, Fox 17 and Hunter 16.</TE>

<HD>A Former Laker Enjoys Revenge</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Patterson, a self-proclaimed Kobe Stopper,
has his day in Trail Blazers' 111-105 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Asked to sum up Ruben Patterson's performance against his Lakers on
Sunday, Coach Phil Jackson captured the man, the mind-set and the
moment in one word: "Revenge."</LD>
<LD>   Revenge for his rejection by the Lakers after one season.</LD>
<LD>   Revenge for what he perceives as Kobe Bryant's condescending
attitude while they were teammates.</LD>
<TE>   Patterson, who refers to himself as "The Kobe Stopper," got a
sweet measure of that revenge at The Rose Garden by playing a key
role in his Portland Trail Blazers' 111-105 victory over the Lakers
in front of a sellout crowd of 20,580.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson made nine of 11 shots, scored 22 points and grabbed
eight rebounds in 27 minutes before fouling out in the final minute.
And even more importantly, he was in Bryant's face for much of a long
afternoon for the Lakers, trash talking with Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant still managed a game-high 28 points, but he was only 11 for
26 from the field and scored only five points while he and Patterson
were on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   When the game was over, Patterson was at the center of a media
crowd in his locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Bonzi Wells had a strong  game for Portland, leading the team
in scoring with 27 points and tying for team-high honors in rebounds
with 10.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, with center Shaquille O'Neal missing from the Laker
lineup for the fifth game in a row, and backup center Samaki Walker
forced to leave the game because of a hyperextended elbow with 8:40
to play and his team ahead by two points, Portland center Dale Davis
(10 rebounds) and forward Rasheed Wallace (25 points) also stood out.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Patterson doing the talking.</TE>
<TE>   "It all started when I was a rookie," he said, referring to the
1998-1999 season. "Ever since that first training camp, Kobe has been
very arrogant. You know Kobe. He talks a lot of trash. But he don't
talk directly to me now. He knows not to talk to me directly."</TE>
<TE>   In the Laker locker room, Bryant tried to keep the focus on the
game, the Lakers' second loss in a row, dropping them to 35-15.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about an alarming tendency by his team to fall behind
early over the last three games, Jackson juggled his starting front
court for the third straight time. After starting Mark Madsen and
then Devean George at power forward the last two games, Jackson went
with Robert Horry on Sunday despite the fact that Jackson likes to
save Horry for instant offense off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Horry responded with instant offense, getting nine of his
season-high 22 points in the first quarter. And the tinkering worked
as the Lakers were competitive from the start against a team that
took the court battling mediocrity at 26-24.</TE>
<TE>   With 6:41 to play, the game was tied at 89.</TE>
<TE>   But then Portland untied it with five straight points--a Wallace
layup, a Wallace free throw, a Wells jump shot--part of an 11-2 run
from which the Lakers never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of reasons for the Lakers' downfall.</TE>
<TE>   There was a backcourt violation during that critical run called
against Rick Fox, who failed to get the ball across midcourt in the
required eight seconds.</TE>
<TE>   There was the disparity in rebounds, Portland taking advantage of
O'Neal's absence to beat the Lakers on the boards, 44-36.</TE>
<TE>   And there was Bryant's inability to continue his recent
effectiveness as a playmaker.</TE>
<TE>   After being in double figures in assists for the last three games,
he had only two on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The flip side is that the Lakers had fallen behind early in each
of those three games. Jackson wanted Bryant to take more open shots,
especially after Friday night's loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Bryant
took 13 shots in that game.</TE>
<TE>   He doubled that total Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, said Jackson, it came down to Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruben Patterson again was the nemesis of the Lakers," Jackson
said. "I think whoever gets to the finals should hire him
immediately. He might be able to help anybody beat us."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' recent struggles obviously haven't dimmed Jackson's
optimism that his team will make it to the NBA finals.</TE>
<TE>   And Patterson's performance hasn't dimmed Bryant's belief that
Patterson doesn't belong on the same court with him. At least not one
on one.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a really good defender," Bryant said. "But five on five is
different. If we bang into each other in the gym and I play him one
on one, I will demolish him."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like Bryant's looking for revenge.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento Becomes Payton's Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle SuperSonics showed that the Sacramento Kings aren't
invincible at home.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Payton scored 31 points and Rashard Lewis had 26, and the
SuperSonics ended the Kings' home winning streak at 20 with a 126-116
victory Sunday night at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   For three quarters, the SuperSonics rolled over the Kings, whose
only previous home loss came Dec. 2 against Dallas, 120-114, in
overtime. The Kings, who have the league's best home record at 27-2,
were chasing the 1985-86 Boston Celtics' NBA mark of 40-1 at home.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess we don't have to worry about 40-1 anymore," King Coach
Rick Adelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Rallying from a 25-point, third-quarter deficit, Sacramento pulled
within 120-116 on a dunk by Chris Webber with 1:21 left. But Payton
responded with a running one-hander off the glass, a layup and two
free throws. Payton had 13 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the man. That's why he's an All-Star," Sacramento guard
Bobby Jackson said. "He played well at the end. He took over the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's 126 points were a season high and the most points given
up by Sacramento this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty simple," Payton said. "We just shot the ball real
well and it was just one of those nights."</TE>
<TE>   Webber scored a season-high 39 points and had 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 105, Phoenix 92--Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki sparked a
21-0 run in the first half for the Mavericks at Phoenix, spoiling the
coaching debut of Frank Johnson, who replaced Scott Skiles earlier in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki finished with 20 points, Michael Finley scored 19 and
Nash had 18. Shawn Marion led the Suns with 27 points and Tony Delk
had 26.</TE>
<TE>   Delk started at point guard for the Suns as Johnson benched
leading scorer Stephon Marbury. Johnson would not comment on Marbury
afterward, and Marbury left without comment.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 86, Philadelphia 76--Jalen Rose scored 12 of his 17 points
in the fourth quarter at Indianapolis, where the 76ers played without
Allen Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, the league's leading scorer, sat out because of a
sprained right big toe. The 76ers also lost Derrick Coleman, who was
ejected midway through the third quarter after getting into a shoving
match with Reggie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 92, New York 89--Karl Malone had 27 points and 16 rebounds,
rookie Jarron Collins scored 19 and the Jazz closed with a 16-5 run
at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   It was Utah's sixth of nine consecutive road games and its fourth
victory in a row. Allan Houston scored 29 for the Knicks, who have
lost six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 91, Toronto 86--Sam Cassell and Ray Allen each had 20
points at Toronto and the Bucks ended a losing streak at three.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Williams had 24 points, but missed three of four free throws
late for the Raptors, who have lost four in a row since the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 98, Denver 77--A sore-armed Kenyon Martin had three
dunks in a game-deciding third quarter to spark the Nets at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, whose bruised right forearm had him questionable until 30
minutes before tip-off, had nine of his 15 points in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 92, Charlotte 78--Shane Battier and Jason Williams each
scored 17 points at Charlotte, N.C., and the Grizzlies ended a road
losing streak at eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies took the lead for good with a 22-7 run to start the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 93, Miami 80--Chauncey Billups scored 23 points and had
eight assists, and Wally Szczerbiak had 22 points to lead the
Timberwolves at Minneapolis. Minnesota used a tight zone defense with
Kevin Garnett pressuring the ballhandlers to force Miami into
long-range jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 100, Golden State 94--Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 26 points
and the Hawks survived a late run by the Warriors at Oakland. The
Warriors, who trailed by as many as 27 points, set a season high for
points in a quarter with 41 in the fourth.</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Denies Williams Handled Gun Recklessly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for former NBA player Jayson Williams has denied a newspaper
report that his client was playfully handling a gun when a limousine
driver was fatally shot.</LD>
<LD>   Williams had been showing off his shotgun in his New Jersey
mansion, flipping it around, when it suddenly went off, The
Star-Ledger of Newark reported Saturday, citing unidentified sources.</LD>
<LD>   But Williams' lawyer, Joseph Hayden, told the newspaper for
Sunday's editions: "There is no basis in fact for any allegation that
Mr. Williams was involved in any horseplay with a gun. There was no
purposeful or reckless behavior on Mr. Williams' part."</LD>
<TE>   Acting Hunterdon County Prosecutor Steven C. Lember has not said
who is believed to be the shooter and said there are no immediate
plans for an arrest. He has said Williams, his brother, Vincent, and
about 10 guests were in the house at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The Star-Ledger, The Record of Hackensack and several broadcast
stations have reported that unidentified law enforcement sources told
them Williams, 33, accidentally fired the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' agent, Sal DiFazio, has characterized The Star-Ledger's
description of the events as "a very accurate portrayal of where
everything is, as far as I know." He declined further comment and
referred questions to Hayden.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were called to Williams' 65-acre estate early Thursday
and found Costas Christofi, 55, in a bedroom with a gunshot wound to
his chest. Authorities have said the shotgun appeared to be one of
several owned by Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   A frail Ted Williams made a surprise visit to a ceremony honoring,
among others, Cal Ripken Jr. and Don Mattingly at the Ted Williams
Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame at Citrus Hills, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer, was greeted by a
thunderous ovation from the 2,000 in attendance when his wheelchair
was rolled to the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "There he is, ladies and gentlemen," said former Dodger manager
Tom Lasorda, the master of ceremonies. "The greatest hitter that God
ever put on Earth, Ted Williams!"</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 83, has battled strokes, congestive heart failure and
kidney failure in recent years. A teary-eyed Williams left after a
brief stay. He raised his right hand and slowly saluted the cheering
crowd as he was raised into a van.</TE>
<TE>   Five players were admitted to the Hitters Hall of Fame at the
ceremony: former Red Sox outfielder Dwight Evans; the late New York
Yankee slugger Roger Maris; St. Louis Cardinals' 10-time all-star
Enos Slaughter; Ripken--the recently retired Baltimore Oriole
star--and Mattingly, the former Yankee first baseman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh reliever Mike Fetters, who filed a trade demand in
November, intends to rescind it if he's not dealt by the March 15
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Fetters, 37, was acquired from the Dodgers in July. If the Pirates
don't trade Fetters by March 15, he would become a free agent but
would lose the remainder of his contract: a $2.15-million salary this
year plus a $250,000 buyout of a $2.75-million club option for 2003.</TE>

<TE>   New York Yankee left-hander David Wells reported no problems, one
day after his first session of throwing off a mound in seven months.
Wells had back surgery in the summer.</TE>

<TE>   The Houston Texans are expected to turn to Jacksonville's first
college draft pick ever as their top pick in today's expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Boselli, the expansion Jaguars' No. 1 pick out of USC in
1995, probably will be called on to help build another expansion
team.</TE>
<TE>   Boselli, selected to the Pro Bowl five times, gave up only 141/2
sacks in his seven-year career. He played three games last season
because of shoulder injuries. His salary cap figure is about $6.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Houston plans to select between 12 and 18 of the 155 players
available in the draft. The team will use 38% of the $71.8-million
salary cap and spend the rest on the college draft in April and on
free agents.</TE>
<TE>   College Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky sophomore guards Gerald Fitch and Cory Sears were
suspended and will not play Tuesday against Tennessee for "behavior
detrimental to the team," Coach Tubby Smith said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The two were involved in a scuffle after the No. 10 Wildcats'
78-69 loss at No. 21 Georgia Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Fitch is Kentucky's fourth-leading scorer, averaging 9.5 points.
Sears is a walk-on who is averaging 0.8 points.</TE>
<TE>   Utah Coach Rick Majerus skipped practice Sunday to rest, one day
after missing a victory over Air Force because of a bronchial
infection and high fever.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't known if Majerus would rejoin the team for tonight's
Mountain West game against New Mexico.</TE>

<TE>   Doug Tewell saved par with an 18-foot putt from the fringe after
hitting into the water on the par-five No. 12 and then held off Hale
Irwin and Bruce Fleisher to win the Senior PGA Tour Verizon Classic
at Lutz, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin had birdies on Nos. 10-14, but closed with four consecutive
pars to finish at nine-under 204, one shot behind Tewell.</TE>

<TE>   Russia's Svetlana Feofanova cleared 15 feet 23/4 to win the

15-61/4, but failed to clear 15-61/2.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Dragila of the U.S., the outdoor world record holder and

<TE>   Tommy Joe Crutcher, a linebacker on the Green Bay Packers' three

<HD>It's Mattiace's Moment</HD>
<DH>Nissan Open: He finally wins in his 220th start on Tour
after McCarron three-putts the 18th. Three golfers tie for second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some things just are what they are and you cannot change them. There
is no alteration policy.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, there are 12 Days of Christmas, Three Stooges, 101
Dalmatians and 18 holes in golf.</LD>
<LD>   You can't just stop after 17 holes and say, well, that's enough,
and then take it to the house. You have to play all 18 before it's
over, which was one too many for the third week in a row.</LD>
<TE>   Three weeks ago at Pebble Beach, Pat Perez hit one ball out of
bounds and another into the ocean and lost at the 18th hole.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Torrey Pines, J.L. Lewis three-putted for a bogey at
the 18th and lost.</TE>
<TE>   And at the 18th hole Sunday at Riviera Country Club, Scott
McCarron reluctantly joined the group, tossing his own three-putt
bogey into the unwelcome mix, handing the Nissan Open to Len
Mattiace.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my tournament to win," McCarron said. "I lost that
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but that's sort of a harsh way to look at it. McCarron's
closing round of 71 dropped him into a three-way tie for second with
Rory Sabbatini and Brad Faxon, who both shot 68. Faxon, in fact,
watched his long birdie putt stop an inch short at the 18th, or he
could have forced a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to look at it is that it was finally Mattiace's turn
to win. After seven years, the 34-year-old from Jacksonville had his
first PGA Tour victory in his 220th tournament. "Feels like it, too,"
said Mattiace, who shot a final-round 68 for a 72-hole total of
15-under 269.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron bogeyed two of the last three holes and failed to make
birdie at the other, the very agreeable par-five 17th. Even so, he
was still even with Mattiace when they reached the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   But while Mattiace put his second shot on the green, McCarron's
ball got caught up in the second cut of kikuyu rough at the back left
of the green, about 24 feet from the hole.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's dilemma was how to play it. Would he chip it down a
fast slippery slope and hope he could get the ball to stop close?</TE>
<TE>   Or would he putt it out of the rough, hope the grass didn't catch
the ball and be able to roll it near the hole?</TE>
<TE>   He decided to use his putter, the long-handled version McCarron
has used for a year, the one that looks like some sort of garden
tool.</TE>
<TE>   He should have used a weed whacker because as soon as he struck
the ball, it hopped up in the air and lost speed, stopping about
seven feet short of the hole. McCarron needed to make the putt from
that distance for his par, but he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   A simple two-putt par by Mattiace later and it was over.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't ever want to see anyone make a mistake like that," said
Mattiace, who was sure that McCarron would make his par putt.
"Strange things happen on 18 in tournaments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Strange things can also happen on other holes in other tournaments
and often cause lasting after-effects. For Mattiace, his was four
years ago at the 1998 Players Championship, when he was one shot off
the lead with two holes to go. He knocked his tee shot into the water
at the 17th and made an eight. Instead of his breakthrough victory,
he tied for fifth. Mattiace said he was badly bothered by the
experience for a month, and it's a hard memory to quiet. "It never
leaves," he said. "It's still hard. It's still there."</TE>
<TE>   For that month, Mattiace said people sort of avoided him. "They
saw me with disaster, in a sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be the last full tournament his mother saw. She
died three months later because of cancer. Now that he has his
victory, Mattiace says he can admit he had doubts he would ever win.</TE>
<TE>   "We live this every day," he said. "It seemed like it was a long
way away. Other times, you could touch it, smell it."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't close enough to do either one of those after playing the
first five holes in one over, including three-putt bogeys at No. 2
and No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, McCarron had a three-shot lead after his third birdie in
a row, at the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   He would not make another.</TE>
<TE>   There was a two-shot swing at the 12th. McCarron made a bogey and
Mattiace holed a bunker shot from 30 feet. Mattiace caught up at the
17th. From 50 feet, his eagle putt hit the hole and popped out, but
he tapped in for birdie.</TE>
<TE>   While Mattiace aimed for a safe spot on the 18th green, about 30
feet to the right of the flag, McCarron went for the pin and paid for
it.</TE>
<TE>   Putting out of the rough was clearly the correct call for him,
McCarron insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only play out of the kikuyu," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toro Taniguchi's 71 left him alone in fifth place at 13-under 271,
one shot ahead of Charles Howell III, Per-Ulrik Johansson and Chris
DiMarco. Johansson had a 66, DiMarco a 67 and Howell a 69.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron played the last seven holes in three over, including a
critical bogey at the par-three 16th when he hit a six-iron into a
bunker. It got worse. His ball stopped in a hole in the bunker that
wasn't raked.</TE>
<TE>   His next chance came at the 576-yard 17th when he pulled his drive
left and left his second shot 15 yards short of the green.</TE>
<TE>   All he could do was save par while Mattiace was nearly making
eagle. Afterward, McCarron said it probably just wasn't his turn.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing you can do about it," he said. "I played some
really good golf and should have won, but I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   All Mattiace could think about was how proud he was. He had just
played in the last group, shot three-under on the back nine at
Riviera, holed a bunker shot at the 12th and won his first
tournament. This winning thing might take a while to get used to, but
he plans on doing more of it, as soon as possible.</TE>

<LD>Len Mattiace may have surprised many when he came from two shots back
with three holes to play and won the Nissan Open Sunday at Riviera
Country Club for his first PGA Tour victory, but he had at least one
believer early in the week.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Chris O'Donnell, who starred in "Batman &amp; Robin," and who
played with Mattiace at Pebble Beach two weeks ago and is a close
friend of Mattiace, had a premonition before the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "He said 'Dude, you're gonna win this week,'" Mattiace said. But
Mattiace, who won for the first time in 220 starts, didn't take much
stock in O'Donnell's power of prognostication.</LD>
<TE>   "He says that every week," Mattiace said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mattiace may want to consider leaving his wife and two daughters
at home in Jacksonville, Fla., more often.</TE>
<TE>   His family normally travels with him, but stayed home for the West
Coast swing this year, thus missing his first victory.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is in [preschool] and needs to practice her letters,"
Mattiace said. "So we thought they would stay home this week."
Mattiace said he planned on calling his wife as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll all cry together when I talk to them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott McCarron said he couldn't strike up many conversations in
the locker room after he blew a two-shot lead with three holes in the
final round, but not because he was at a loss for words.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would talk to me," he said. "It was like I had the
plague." With those words still rolling off his tongue, McCarron's
cell phone rang and he shot a quick glance at the caller ID
indicator. "My mom is calling me," he said, smiling. "She still loves
me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McCarron said the loss would not fester long, especially with the
World Match Play championships beginning Wednesday. He said he's
looking forward to his first-round match against Scotsman Colin
Montgomerie, who lives in England.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like I've got Montgomerie," McCarron said. "I'm gonna
make his trip short."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fred Funk did his best to make it a banner day for the University
of Maryland, but couldn't keep a hot streak going long enough.</TE>
<TE>   Funk, who coached the Maryland golf team from 1982-88, had a
string of five consecutive birdies going on Nos. 7-11 right around
the time the Maryland basketball team was upsetting top-ranked Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Funk pulled within two shots of the lead, but bogeys at 15 and 16
put him out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   Funk finished at 10-under-par, in a tie for ninth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III used a course-record, seven-under 28 on the
front nine to get in contention Saturday, but shot 34 on the same
holes Sunday and could not make a further move.</TE>
<TE>   Howell, 22, is among a select few of young PGA Tour pros expected
to blossom into a rival for Tiger Woods over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   He began the day four shots out of the lead, shot 69 and finished
three shots back in a tie for sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get started off good enough today," Howell said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to do that if you want to win, especially in the last
round of a tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-place finish was the ninth top-10 in 44 starts for
Howell, including three in his five starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Duval played the first three holes in the final round
Sunday, then withdrew citing illness.</TE>
<TE>   Duval, who began the day tied for 10th at seven-under, didn't
sleep well Saturday night because of a stomach virus, according to a
PGA Tour spokesman. Duval let tour officials know he would likely not
finish his final round, but wanted to give it a try anyway. He
started birdie, bogey, bogey before pulling out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour has had six come-from-behind winners in seven events
this year. The only third-round leader that held on to win was Jerry
Kelly in the Sony Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Final attendance for the four days of the Nissan Open was 121,808.
Sunday's 45,872 was the highest single-day total.</TE>

<HD>Righetti's Not a Cinderella</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Maria Righetti's wrestling team may have been the best-kept
secret in the Southern Section this year, but the cat's out of the
bag now.</LD>
<LD>   Righetti, runner-up to Moreno Valley Canyon Springs in the
Southern Section Division III dual meet championships, had a
meet-high four weight class winners at the Eastern Division
championships Saturday night and finished in third place behind
Covina Northview and Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   "A couple of teams knew about us," Righetti Coach Dutch Van Patten
said. "But we're kind of hidden up there."</LD>
<TE>   Righetti has logged a lot of miles and tallied some serious
expense reports to get itself on the map. Two weeks ago, the team
made the four-hour drive to Lakewood for the dual meet championships,
stayed two nights and returned home.</TE>
<TE>   The team then drove about five hours to Riverside Norte Vista High
for the Eastern Division championships. Next, it's another five-hour
ride to Fountain Valley for the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Van Patten estimates that more than $6,000 will have been spent
for the trips. What's more, the school doesn't have vans for the team
so the team rents vans from a local car company.</TE>
<TE>   It has all paid off, Van Patten said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had a chance to win [the Eastern Division
championships]," he said. "Everything would have had to go right, but
it didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Things aren't going to get any easier for Righetti next season.
League realignment in the Central Coast region will make the new
Pac-Five League one of the toughest in the Southern Section. Arroyo
Grande, Paso Robles and Atascadero will join Righetti in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Wrestling is starting to catch on fire up there," Van Patten
said. "There is some good wrestling up there because of that, but the
bad thing is that we're all going to be in the same league next year.
That's gonna be tough."</TE>
<TE>   Vanguards on the move: El Modena has emerged as a force in recent
weeks. The Vanguards edged Villa Park, 178.5-174, Saturday to win the
Central Division championship--a division that also included Corona
Centennial and Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   Orange El Modena was runner-up in the Division I dual meet
championship. Saturday, El Modena had only two weight class
wins--Daniel Contreras at 160 pounds and Kevin Lukes at
heavyweight--but qualified a meet-best seven wrestlers for the
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy hitters: The heavyweight class at the Eastern Division
championships offered some of the top competition at that weight in
any California tournament this season. Arturo Basulto of Arroyo
Grande pinned William Johnson of Tustin in 5:40 to win the title.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who began the tournament undefeated this season, beat
Adam Patino of Northview, 8-6, in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Basulto and Patino are ranked Nos. 3 and 4 in the state. Johnson
is unranked, but has defeated three of the top six ranked
heavyweights this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I could easily see those three finishing in the top four at
state," Northview Coach David Ochoa said. "That was a tough weight in
this tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Just a second: Santa Ana Calvary Chapel finished second in the
Northern Division, marking just the second time in the last 11 years
that the Eagles failed to win a Southern Section title. The two-time
defending state champions have not won any tournaments this season.</TE>
<TE>   Recap: Team champions from the Southern Section championships were
as follows: Canyon Springs in the Northern; El Modena, Central;
Temecula Valley, Southern; Northview, Eastern; Laguna Hills, Coastal;
Chino Hills Ayala, Inland.</TE>

<LD>When Len Mattiace finished the 18th hole at Riviera with an exuberant
howl that was swallowed up in the cheers of the gallery, it was
festive and celebratory. Mattiace was now a 34-year-old first-time
winner on the PGA Tour and his applause was well-earned.</LD>
<LD>   An hour earlier, Fred Couples had come to the same 18th hole. As
Couples walked up the fairway, the crowd stood and roared and Couples
couldn't help but smile. He smiled even more when he capped off his
five-under-par round of 66 with an eight-foot putt to save par. It
was a little triumph that earned a big reaction.</LD>
<LD>   The golf fans know. Couples may not play here again. He is 42 and
he loves Riviera about as much as he loves any course in the world.
Ten years ago, Couples won his second Nissan Los Angeles Open title
at Riviera and then he won the Masters and became the world's
top-ranked golfer. Now, Couples is not in the top 100 in the world
rankings. A week ago Saturday, Couples reached over to pick up some
range balls and felt something pop in his back. That was a bad day.</LD>
<TE>   This week was a good week. There were no pops in his back and the
ball was flying off his driver. He is getting comfortable with a new
putter. His 66 Sunday tied him with Per-Ulrik Johansson and Billy
Mayfair for low round of the day. His 21st appearance at Riviera
earned Couples his 10th top-10 finish.</TE>
<TE>   It led him to say how much this course means to him, how he
appreciates its tight corners and how it rewards skillful iron
players. He feels the history of the place. He met his wife, Thais,
while playing at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   And Couples has come to the point in his career where winning the
Nissan Open is not the challenge. Winning the Masters again, that is
the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Couples is a little like Pete Sampras. Sampras is clear about why
he is still playing tennis. It is to win major championships. Couples
was clear Sunday about why he is still playing. "The Masters,"
Couples says. "My big goal is to do well at the Masters once more."</TE>
<TE>   His love for Augusta is even greater than his love for Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Nantz, Couples' roommate and golf teammate at the University
of Houston and good friend for 25 years, says that from the time the
two met, Couples has been drawn to Augusta. "It is the course that
was suited to Fred," Nantz said. "It was the place he knew he should
do well."</TE>
<TE>   His only green jacket came in the magical 1992 season. He tied for
second in 1998 but never came seriously close to another win. Even
during his disaster of a 2001 season, when he missed the cut at the
British Open and the U.S. Open, Couples finished 26th at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, by the end of last year, Couples was ranked No. 131 in the
world. In his 21-year pro career, Couples had never before finished
lower than 76th. He missed the cut five times. His back hurt often,
his beautiful swing was betrayed by a bad putter and his enthusiasm
seemed missing.</TE>
<TE>   If 2002 is the same as 2001 for Couples, he says, "I'm going to
have to re-evaluate what I'm doing here and whether I want to
continue."</TE>
<TE>   Nantz watched Couples closely Sunday. Nantz was the analyst for
CBS and confessed that he might have spent more time than usual
talking about a ninth-place finisher. But Nantz was intrigued. Golf
tournaments are about so much more than who wins and loses.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the day belonged to Mattiace, but Nantz kept being
drawn to Couples. He loved the way Couples fought to save par at 15
with a long putt and the up-and-down at 18.</TE>
<TE>   He loved the way Couples was focused and the way Couples seemed
comfortable with the putter. He loved the way the ball flew off
Couples' driver, the way it soared so high and far, the way it did in
the best days when Couples was on top of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, my goodness, that's what I was thinking today,"
Nantz said.</TE>
<TE>   It is what happens to us when we reach a certain age. Ten years
ago sounds like a lifetime but feels like a moment and it's hard not
to think of ourselves as we were 10 years ago as the same way we are
now.</TE>
<TE>   Couples sees himself as he is. A man who will not be No. 1 again.
He was proud to say that "I haven't missed a cut this year. I'm five
for five." He was touched by the reaction of the gallery and pleased
with his last three rounds of 68, 68 and 66. There was a point on
Friday, after his opening 72, where Couples seemed in danger of
missing the cut. "But he didn't," Nantz said. "That's one of those
little battles."</TE>
<TE>   At the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month, Nantz and Couples and
friends and family had a nice dinner after the Saturday round.
Knowing how much Couples is aiming for the Masters, Nantz wanted to
give his friend something else to swing for. This year's WGC-NEC
Invitational, the August event usually held in Akron at Firestone for
the top 50 ranked golfers, is going to be played at Sahalee Country
Club outside of Seattle. Seattle is where Couples grew up and learned
golf and where he is beloved.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Freddie he needs to qualify for Sahalee this year. I told
him I want to see him walking up the 18th hole on Sunday at Sahalee.
I want to see that reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Couples wants to see another reaction first. As he walks up the
18th at Augusta on the final Sunday, in contention.</TE>

<HD>Suns' Skiles Resigns, Johnson Takes Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Scott Skiles stepped down Sunday as coach of the Phoenix Suns and was
replaced by assistant Frank Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   The Suns, who have been in the playoffs every season since
1987-88, are out of playoff contention. They were 25-26 under Skiles.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, 43, the first African American coach in franchise
history, plans no immediate lineup changes.</LD>
<TE>   There were reports of friction between the intense Skiles, at 37
the NBA's second-youngest coach, and some of his players. But Skiles
said he wasn't aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   "You may have to ask the players," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Hardaway, mentioned as one of the malcontents, called the
situation unfortunate but sounded upbeat about the change.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to come together as a group to salvage the rest of the
season and make the playoffs," Hardaway said.</TE>
<TE>   Skiles became the team's coach 20 games into the 1999-2000 season,
replacing Danny Ainge, who resigned. Skiles finished the season 40-22
and led the Suns to a 51-31 record last season.</TE>

<HD>Venus Survives Henin Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venus Williams outlasted Justine Henin to win the final, 6-3, 5-7,
6-3, in the Diamond Games tournament Sunday at Antwerp, Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   "For me and my family this is a dream come true," said Williams,
who had a tougher than expected match against Henin.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who didn't lose a set until the final, started the match
with a 113-mph ace on her first serve.</LD>
<TE>   Henin answered with closely played balls to the net, setting the
stage for an evenly matched final.</TE>
<TE>   "She was putting me on the run, putting me in compromising
positions," Williams said. "She definitely could have won that
match."</TE>
<TE>   While unable to serve at the speed of her opponent, Henin managed
two early aces to delight the home crowd of 12,000 at the Antwerp
Sportpaleis.</TE>
<TE>   "With the support of the public ... I was able to turn things
around in the second set, now I'm a bit disappointed," Henin said.
"I'll try to do better next year."</TE>
<TE>   Williams has won three events this season, the first also came in
a final against Henin at the Gold Coast tournament in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is 4-1 lifetime against Henin, including a three-set win
in last year's Wimbledon final.</TE>
<TE>   Williams promised to return to the Diamond Games event the next
two years, to vie for a gold, diamond-encrusted racket worth about
$870,000, which she can get by winning the tournament three times in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Seles beat Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, 7-6, 6-3, to
win the Qatar Open.</TE>
<TE>   Seles got her first victory of the year following a loss to
Martina Hingis in the final of the Pan Pacific Open and semifinal
defeats at the Australia Open and Gaz de France.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Enqvist of Sweden came from behind to beat Nicolas Escude
of France, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-1, to win his third Open 13 title in
Marseille, France.</TE>
<TE>   Enqvist also won the tournament in 1997 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Escude served 19 aces to Enqvist's 12 and led, 3-2, after winning
the first set. But Enqvist won 10 of the next 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Enqvist is 3-0 against Escude.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Lars Burgsmuller won his first ATP Tour title, defeating
Olivier Rochus of Belgium, 6-3, 6-3, in the final of the Copenhagen
Open.</TE>

<LD>Adding to UCLA's growing pile of problems are the turnovers committed
by seniors Matt Barnes and Billy Knight.</LD>
<LD>   Barnes had nine in two games this week to give him a team-high 68
and Knight had five to rank him second with 54. Barnes had six
turnovers in three consecutive games before cutting down to three in
the 69-68 loss to Arizona State on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Barnes, a forward, also is the team assist leader with 82, a
product of his strong arm and ability to find leading scorer Jason
Kapono on the perimeter.</LD>
<TE>   But like a pitcher who believes he can blow his fastball past any
hitter, he sometimes throws reckless passes.</TE>
<TE>   Both players also turn the ball over when they hold it too long.
Knight, a guard, is an excellent spot-up shooter and Barnes has a
variety of offensive moves, but they are prone to having the ball
stripped because neither is blessed with quick hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I have to cut down on turnovers," Barnes said. "I'm
looking to create opportunities for my teammates and sometimes make
passes I shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Against Arizona State, UCLA had 18 turnovers and the Sun Devils
had nine.</TE>
<TE>   Knight had one understandable turnover, traveling with one second
left while trying to launch a desperation pass. But he also had the
ball stripped twice and made a poor pass.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to take care of the ball, myself included," he said.
"In a game with a slower pace like [against Arizona State], every
possession counts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kapono's three three-point baskets against Arizona State give him
74, fourth on the all-time Bruin single-season list.</TE>
<TE>   The junior forward already holds the two top spots with totals of
84 and 82 the last two seasons. Tracy Murray is third with 78 in
1992, so Kapono is almost assured of owning the three highest totals.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono's 240 career three-pointers is 43 more than second-place
Murray, and climbing.</TE>
<TE>   He also is the most accurate long-range shooter, having made
46.7%.</TE>
<TE>   On UCLA's all-time scoring list, Kapono ranks 16th with 1,520.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Aggressive at the End</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So it turns out USC did learn something from its last-second losses.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to stay aggressive toward the end of the game," said
Trojan senior point guard Brandon Granville. "The referees don't like
to make calls at the end. They want you to play it out and decide
it."</LD>
<LD>   In buzzer-beating losses to Pepperdine, California and UCLA, the
Trojans held leads before becoming tentative on offense, only to
watch the Waves, Golden Bears and Bruins win with desperation
three-point baskets.</LD>
<TE>   Against Arizona on Saturday, USC remained aggressive to the end
and while the Wildcats were in a position to tie the score on a late
three-pointer by Jason Gardner, he slipped and was called for
traveling and the Trojans went on to win, 94-89.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Trojans' sweep of Arizona State and Arizona, Sam Clancy
averaged 23.5 points and 10.5 rebounds while extending his
nation-leading streak of double-doubles to 10. The senior power
forward also jumped into fourth place on USC's career scoring list
with 1,510 points, 14 points behind Wayne Carlander.</TE>
<TE>   David Bluthenthal averaged 26 points and 9.5 rebounds in the two
games, and had career bests in points (31) and three-point baskets
(seven) against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC, 18-6 overall, 10-4 in the Pac-10 and in a three-way tie for
first with Oregon and Stanford, jumped three places in the latest
coaches' poll to No. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' rating percentage index ranking, a tool used to
determine seeding in the NCAA tournament, was at No. 29, according to
collegerpi.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Press poll, in which USC was also No. 25 last week,
comes out today.</TE>

<HD>Democratic Base May Appear Shaky, but It's Solid Enough to
Support Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reporters descended on a state Democratic convention over the weekend
to poke at the party's base--to see how firm it is for Gov. Gray
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   For the last year or two, the political wisdom has been that
Davis' support is soft where it should be the strongest, in the
Democrats' liberal base.</LD>
<LD>   There, left-wingers are frustrated with the governor's centrist
policies. He's not behaving like a real Democrat, the cry echoes.
Ideologues are so unenthused that they could walk in November and
vote for another centrist, Republican Dick Riordan.</LD>
<TE>   Well, prying and probing around that base--represented by 2,000
delegates and junkies at the downtown Bonaventure Hotel--this is what
I found:</TE>
<TE>   * Lukewarm enthusiasm for Davis, at best.</TE>
<TE>   * A lot of enthusiasm for the Democratic Party and keeping it a
winner.</TE>
<TE>   * No enthusiasm for taking a walk.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, to truly put this in perspective, you've got to look at
warring Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded front-runner, Riordan, has a much bigger problem with
the GOP conservative base. And if either of the far-right underdogs,
Bill Jones or Bill Simon, should capture the nomination, that
Republican candidate would single-handedly rally the Democratic base
for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democratic delegates did send mixed signals. Clearly Davis
is not their idol.</TE>
<TE>   As he addressed the convention Saturday, half the audience rose on
cue, cheering and waving campaign signs when the governor proclaimed,
"I am here to seek your endorsement for reelection." (Routinely
awarded.)</TE>
<TE>   But half the crowd sat, many expressionless.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I sat through a 90-minute parade of speakers at the Chicano/Latino
caucus, and nobody mentioned Davis' name except his wife, Sharon.
There were no Davis campaign signs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to support him, although we're not totally
satisfied," said caucus Chairman Placido Salazar, a facilities
planner at College of Marin.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar contended that Davis hasn't appointed enough Latinos to
administration jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But "the Democratic base is solid," he added, and acknowledged the
squeaky-wheel tactics always at play: "We have to show some concern
[about Davis] to push our agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Teresa de la Rosa, an immigrants advocate from Porterville, also
mentioned a reality about Davis' demeanor: "He's not one who makes
you feel passionate about him."</TE>
<TE>   To rev up Davis' support among Latinos, Davis strategists intend
this week to begin airing campaign ads on Spanish-language TV.</TE>
<TE>   The spots will feature Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a piece of the
base who three years ago feuded with the governor over Proposition
187, the anti-illegal-immigration initiative. Bustamante wanted a
quick kill; Davis finessed a slow death.</TE>
<TE>   Political pragmatism has brought the two back together.</TE>
<TE>   Pragmatism also has forced the governor to buttress a rickety
bridge to organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   He could not have won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination four
years ago without union backing. But once in office, Davis moved too
slowly on labor's demands for its leaders. The centrist governor was
simultaneously wooing business interests and their campaign
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge was bolstered Friday when Davis signed a bill providing
significant increases in workers' compensation benefits for people
hurt on the job. He had previously vetoed three similar bills.</TE>
<TE>   I asked the Labor Caucus chairman, Jim Gordon from the
communications workers, to assess union feelings about Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Much better since he signed workers' compensation," Gordon
answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's his way of reaching back out. Labor's certainly
appreciative. He'd have had a very rough row to hoe this time without
labor....He's a friend who's getting back on track."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that the Democratic Party in California--at this point
in history--knows how to seize power and is committed to holding it.
The GOP hasn't shown that for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic politicians have been propelled by a resurgent labor
movement, new-citizen immigrants and women frightened of Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   It all feeds on itself with government patronage jobs, the vast
majority of them filled by Democratic pols.</TE>
<TE>   When the call went out for hundreds of young volunteers to work
the convention, 50% more showed up than were needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a lot of people walking around with their resumes today,"
said Evelyn Jerome, 30, of Santa Monica, a PR consultant and past
president of the L.A. Young Democrats. "Many are hoping to become
volunteers in a campaign and get a job when their candidate wins."</TE>
<TE>   As for Davis, "He's a tough personality to like," she said. "But
when it comes to issues, he's there."</TE>
<TE>   This base will support Davis.</TE>

<DH>Tourism: Fresno's subterranean wonderland was one man's
quirky garden masterpiece.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Nearly a century after Baldasare Forestiere's shovel first hit
hardpan, the underground gardens that the Sicilian immigrant carved
from his 70 useless acres continue to fascinate and flummox the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Fought over by family, marveled at by neighbors and mythologized
by curiosity seekers, the labyrinth of 70 subterranean rooms,
courtyards and corridors quickly became one of this city's quirkiest
tourist draws.</LD>
<LD>   Decades of lawsuits and neglect followed Forestiere's death at 67
in 1946. But since control of the gardens recently passed to his
great-nephew Andre, a new era appears to be at hand.</LD>
<TE>   Brides book the place for summer weddings. Businesses hold
meetings and banquets at the site. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who
toured the gardens earlier this year, is one of an estimated 15,000
annual visitors.</TE>
<TE>   With the local tourist board planning to promote the gardens
during a trip to New York, Andre hopes his eccentric uncle will
finally get the respect he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is an expression of the beauty of Baldasare's soul,"
said Andre Forestiere, Baldasare's great-nephew by marriage. "It's a
feat of engineering and architecture. It's eccentric, but taken as a
whole it's a work of art, and people are beginning to realize that."</TE>
<TE>   The realization has come slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Baldasare Forestiere died without a will, and a dispute over the
property landed the family in court. A promoter leased the gardens in
the 1940s and '50s, filled the halls and rooms with earth to make
them smaller, then billed the place as the bizarre home of "The Mole
Man of Fresno."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors ran rampant. Some said Forestiere's caverns were an
expression of grief brought on when his fiancee refused to live
underground. (His family says he was never engaged.) Baldasare
Forestiere began his excavations in 1905, soon after learning that
the San Joaquin Valley land he bought sight unseen was no more than a
thin layer of topsoil over hardpan. Finding it unsuitable for the
citrus grove he had hoped to plant, Forestiere found himself falling
back on skills learned working in the subways of Boston and New York.</TE>
<TE>   During his first Fresno summer, he used a pick and shovel to chip
through the concrete-like dirt to create a cellar to escape the
region's brutal heat. He soon expanded the cellar into several rooms,
in which Forestiere took up residence. He hired himself out as a
farmhand and continued excavating his property.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people ever understood what Baldasare was trying to
accomplish," said Kenneth Scambray, a professor of English at the
University of La Verne who grew up in Fresno. "Forestiere's gardens
became a sort of remembrance to him," Scambray said. "He grew up in
the hills of Messina, and when you look at the landscape there, it is
laced with caves and catacombs and grottoes."</TE>
<TE>   Forestiere's four decades of tunneling resulted in an estimated
seven acres with carved courtyards, niches, patios, arches, benches,
peepholes and elaborate passageways 12 to 25 feet below the surface.
Architects and engineers marvel at his craftsmanship, which included
skylights and ingenious vents to create a constant air flow.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forestiere Underground Gardens are unique in the world," said
Brian Ziegler, director of tourism for the Fresno Visitor's Bureau.
Ziegler plans to talk up the gardens on a business trip to Manhattan
next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to pitch it hard," Ziegler said. "We all think the city
is lucky to have this place, and it really seems to speak to people."</TE>

<HD>Retailers Who Sold the Tickets Get Lucky Too</HD>
<DH>Lottery: A 7-Eleven in Montebello and another in Orange
sold two of the three winning tickets. Each store owner will get
about $321,600.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She doesn't even have the check yet. But already Margie Bennett,
owner of a Montebello 7-Eleven store, is deciding how she and her
husband will spend some of the bonus they will collect from Saturday
night's $193-million Lotto jackpot.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a nephew who would love to go to college," Bennett said.
"Then there's the employees. I got struggling students and a single
mom working two jobs."</LD>
<LD>   Bennett's store sold one of the three lucky tickets to
as-yet-unidentified winners in Saturday night's SuperLotto Plus
drawing. The jackpot was the largest in U.S. history for a lottery
that involved just one state.</LD>
<TE>   According to California Lottery rules, retailers who sell winning
tickets are entitled to 0.5% of the jackpot, in this case, $965,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts will get about $321,600, with the rest going to the
other two stores that sold winning tickets--one in Orange, one in
Half Moon Bay.</TE>
<TE>   That's a heck of a lot of cash, Bennett said as she worked the
store counter Sunday. "I'm just at a loss for words."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange, 7-Eleven store clerk Devinder Singh tried to man his
counter but was interrupted repeatedly by visiting reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The winning numbers--6, 11, 31, 32, 39 and Mega Number 20--were
drawn just before 8 p.m. Saturday, but it may be Tuesday before the
winners come forward, since Lotto offices are closed today, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   But in Montebello, the celebration already had begun. "Everybody
in Montebello already knows" who sold one of the winning tickets,
said Margie Bennett's husband, Byron, who was passing out free coffee
and doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   "You just work, work, work," said Margie Bennett, who says she has
been at the store nearly every day since the couple bought it 18
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "And in between you take care of your kids, and you just never
think it will happen to you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the bulk of the cash award will probably go to her
daughters, both of whom will be heading off to college in a few
years.</TE>
<TE>   No word yet from the store owner in Orange on how he'll spend his
windfall.</TE>
<TE>   California Lottery spokeswoman Nora Minas said officials tried to
notify Harry Biasala at his store Sunday morning, but employees said
he was on vacation--somewhere in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty ironic, don't you think?" Minas said. "The jackpot is
here in California and he's in Las Vegas."</TE>

<HD>Diana Gaines, 89; Novelist Won Popularity in 1950s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diana Gaines, who wrote six popular novels in the mid-20th century,
beginning with "Tasker Martin," the story of a rags-to-riches
industrialist unhappy with the life he created, has died. She was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Gaines died Feb. 8 at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.
She had lived in the wealthy retirement community with her husband,
Dr. Henry L. Jaffe, since 1964, said their son, Stephen Jaffe.</LD>
<LD>   Howard Hughes bought the movie rights for Gaines' original "Tasker
Martin" novel, which was described in a 1950 Times review as racy and
"an absorbing story of modern times, written in a refreshingly
original style."</LD>
<TE>   Gaines' other books, many of them translated into various
languages for European publication, were "Dr. Logan's Wife" in 1951,
"Marry in Anger" in 1958, "Dangerous Climate" in 1960, "The Knife and
the Needle" in 1962, and "Nantucket Woman" a few years later.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Gaines was educated at Smith College and the
University of Chicago. She began her career as an advertising
copywriter, working for an agency and then for Marshall Field's
department stores. She edited a baseball magazine, Fan and Family,
for the Chicago Cubs when the team was owned by the Wrigley family.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines married Jaffe in Eagle River, Wis., in 1934, and moved west
with him when he was assigned to a Navy hospital in San Diego during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband and son Stephen of Beverly Hills, she
is survived by their two other sons, Andrew and Bruce of New York.</TE>

<HD>G. de Gaulle-Anthonioz, 81; Nazi Fighter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of the late French President
Charles de Gaulle who joined the French Resistance and was later
deported to a Nazi concentration camp, has died. She was 81.</LD>
<LD>   De Gaulle-Anthonioz died Thursday in Paris after an undisclosed
illness, according to officials at ATD Quart Monde, a French
humanitarian organization that she once led.</LD>
<LD>   President Jacques Chirac on Friday paid homage to the modest woman
with a famous name who joined the French underground in 1940 at age
19 after the Nazi occupation of Paris.</LD>
<TE>   "By the strength of her commitment, her unfailing determination
and her limitless courage, she symbolized the spirit of the
resistance," Chirac said.</TE>
<TE>   Her work for the underground ended in 1943, when she was arrested
and, after six months in a French prison, deported to Ravensbruck, a
concentration camp in Germany for female political prisoners. More
than 90,000 women and children of the 132,000 incarcerated perished
there before the Russians liberated the camp in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 years after the war--at the urging of her family--De
Gaulle-Anthonioz wrote "The Dawn of Hope: A Memoir of Ravensbruck and
Beyond."</TE>
<TE>   The slim volume recounts how women prisoners--largely Dutch and
French opponents of Nazism--were "massacred with pickaxes, eaten to
death by dogs."</TE>
<TE>   In a Los Angeles Times review of the book, Susan Salter Reynolds
wrote: "Oddly, one of the most touching qualities of this memoir is
the writer's reluctance in remembering; she practically stumbles on
the deeper scenes and details, such as the first time she noticed the
empty eyes of other inmates or the overwhelming gratitude for any
kindness from friends or guards or the possessions she felt so lucky
to have--needles and thread, socks knitted by a friend. She remembers
the cockroaches in her cell and the names she gave them. She
remembers various cruelties: a woman beaten to death for washing her
underwear and the face of the guard who beat her."</TE>
<TE>   De Gaulle-Anthonioz, who spent part of her time at Ravensbruck in
solitary confinement in an underground cell, considered herself one
of the lucky inmates, writing in her book: "I was struck with the
absolute certainty that there was indeed a fate far worse than death:
the destruction of our souls."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, de Gaulle-Anthonioz helped establish the Assn. for
Deported and Imprisoned Resistance Fighters, and she was a witness in
the trial of Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie in 1987. She testified about
gruesome medical experiments performed on 74 young Polish women by
German doctors and described how several babies born to the inmates
were drowned in buckets of water after birth.</TE>
<TE>   "Ravensbruck was a work camp from the start, and according to the
Germans, extermination by work was the best solution," testified De
Gaulle-Anthonioz, who sewed German uniforms until she was placed in
solitary confinement. "Faced with the number of deaths, there was
always a need for more manpower. Those who were used up had to be
eliminated. That is why they decided to build a gas chamber in the
camp."</TE>
<TE>   De Gaulle-Anthonioz was the daughter of Xavier de Gaulle, older
brother of the French president, and the wife of the late Bernard
Anthonioz, a resistance fighter she married in 1946. The couple had
four children.</TE>
<TE>   ATD Quart Monde said she would be buried in a private ceremony in
the Alpine Savoie region next to her husband, who died in 1994.</TE>

<HD>John Gardner; Common Cause Founder Was 89</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John W. Gardner, educator's educator, Cabinet secretary who served as
the midwife for Medicare and--most memorably--the founder of Common
Cause, who preached grass-roots citizen participation in government
and became known as "the father of campaign finance reform," has
died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner, secretary of Health, Education and Welfare during the
Lyndon B. Johnson administration, died Saturday at his home in Palo
Alto on the campus of Stanford University, where he had taught since
1989.</LD>
<LD>   An intellectual, a Republican, a liberal and innovative thinker,
and a lifelong advocate of public involvement to renew and strengthen
the nation, Gardner came into his own when he launched Common Cause
on Aug. 18, 1970. Designed as a "citizens' lobby," the organization
would campaign to end the Vietnam War, block development of a
supersonic transport plane, reform the welfare system, extend access
to public records and, enduringly, work for campaign finance reform,
which is still in the headlines today.</LD>
<TE>   Gardner, a native of Los Angeles, returned frequently to advocate
reforms of campaign financing and other issues. In 1973, as the
Watergate scandal wound on, he wrote in an op-ed page article for The
Times: "The first step is redesign of our present system of campaign
financing. The Watergate could not have happened had it not been for
the huge amounts of secret cash in ... various black satchels."</TE>
<TE>   Among those reforms, he recommended public financing of election
campaigns, limiting private contributions and expenditures in a given
race, ending organized committee giving and strict oversight and
fines for violations. He saw many of his proposals enacted into
federal and state law.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner campaigned in 1974 for passage of California's Proposition
9, which provided for full disclosure of campaign contributions,
curbs on contributions from registered lobbyists and tighter
disclosure rules for state and local officials.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset, Gardner planned to recruit 100,000 members for his
Common Cause, which he described as a "true citizens' lobby concerned
not with the advancement of special interests but with the well-being
of the nation." In less than six months he had signed up the 100,000,
and by the time he stepped down as president in 1977, his ambitious
organization boasted 253,000 dues-paying citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics claimed that Common Cause overlapped efforts of
existing organizations such as the ACLU and Sierra Club and that, far
from representing all the people, it encompassed only wealthy,
liberal, elitist intellectuals. But none of that detracted from
genuine inroads made by Gardner and his group.</TE>
<TE>   "When Americans attend open meetings or read their government's
documents, or take part in our battered but resilient public finance
system for presidential elections, there is a memorial to John
Gardner," current Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.
"When we turn on public television, or when government ensures no
senior or poor person goes without health care, we take part in
programs John Gardner initiated."</TE>
<TE>   That episode was one in a long string of successes for the man who
seemed never to stop thinking, acting, prodding and pontificating for
the betterment of mankind.</TE>
<TE>   He began and ended his six-decade career doing formally what he
always did in various ways--teaching. With degrees in psychology from
Stanford and UC Berkeley, he taught psychology at Connecticut College
for Women and Mount Holyoke College from 1938 to 1942. Next came a
year with the Federal Communications Commission and a stint in the
Marine Corps during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After many intervening years of practicing and espousing public
service, he capped his career by returning to his alma mater,
Stanford, in 1989 to teach--what else?--public service.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner spent two decades with the New York-based Carnegie Corp.
and its Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching, providing
grants and support for innovative education programs. He began as a
staff member in 1946, was president by 1955, and remained until
President Johnson tapped him for his Cabinet in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent advisor to government educational and social endeavors,
Gardner--despite being odd man out in the Democratic
administration--was a logical choice for Johnson's "Great Society."
He thrived on fighting for education, anti-poverty and health
programs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to managing the huge and unwieldy bureaucracy of HEW,
and as a respected educator delaying its spinoff of education,
Gardner found himself working for such diverse issues as automobile
air-pollution controls, noncommercial public television and radio,
integration of schools and hospitals, welfare reform and improving
public health.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson relied upon him to implement the gargantuan new and
controversial Medicare program as well as to enforce the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and help drive through the landmark 1965 Elementary and
Secondary Education Act.</TE>
<TE>   None of it daunted Gardner. What prompted him to resign in 1968
was his growing dissatisfaction with the war in Vietnam and
conviction that Johnson should neither pursue the war nor reelection.</TE>
<TE>   When he left political office, Gardner only strengthened his work
for public reforms. But he did it through citizen and lobbying
groups, first for the Urban Coalition, which he chaired from 1968 to
1970, and then with Common Cause.</TE>
<TE>   He had one more project before returning to his beloved classroom,
and in the late 1970s began a decade of organizing private charities
and voluntary organizations to combat government regulation that
thwarted their efforts to serve the public. In 1980, he co-founded
and chaired Independent Sector to encourage volunteerism and win
government support for it.</TE>
<TE>   To train young people for public service, Gardner worked for years
to establish what became the White House Fellows program and chaired
its advisory commission from 1977 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   After President John F. Kennedy named Gardner to his Task Force on
Education and as chair of the U.S. Advisory Commission on
International Educational and Cultural Affairs, Gardner in 1962
edited a volume of Kennedy's speeches, "To Turn the Tide."</TE>
<TE>   A prolific writer, Gardner continually penned opinion articles for
newspapers and magazines and wrote seven books, always urging people
to strive toward new goals. Among them were "Excellence: Can We Be
Equal and Excellent Too?" in 1961 and, three years later,
"Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society." A Times
reviewer wrote of the latter book: "This is one of those rich and
rare books which you should read slowly. Gardner ... presents as many
ideas on a single page as some authors do in a whole chapter--and
then reread."</TE>
<TE>   "Gardner writes with great clarity and brilliance," the reviewer
commented. "The book should be required reading for any person
wondering just where he is going on life's long journey."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent Gardner books included "No Easy Victories," "Recovery
of Confidence," "In Common Cause" and "Morale."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner was chairman of the National Civic League from 1994 to
1996 and at various times served as trustee of the New York School of
Social Work, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Stanford
University, Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Enterprise
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964 and
two years later Gardner received the National Academy of Sciences
Public Welfare Medal.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Aida Marroquin;
two daughters, Stephanie Gardner Trimble and Francesca Gardner; a
brother, Louis Gardner; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Primaries Become the Real Battleground</HD>
<DH>Politics: With most legislative seats made safe for their
parties, the races now focus on nominations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Sheila Kuehl sat down last November and penned a little letter to her
''dear friends''--the 8,000 or so people who wrote the checks that
helped her become the first openly lesbian member of the California
Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Kuehl did not envision the letter as a declaration of war against
the moderate, business-friendly politicians now gaining prominence in
her own Democratic Party. But she was asking her donors for more
money to bankroll ''like-minded'' liberal candidates, so that
essentially is what it was.</LD>
<LD>   The letter soon was widely disseminated and discussed in
Sacramento, because what Kuehl wrote perfectly captured the theme of
this year's state legislative campaigns, which are no longer really
about electing Republicans or Democrats in November.</LD>
<TE>   Rather, the campaigns are about electing the right Republican or
Democratic candidates in next month's primaries; with only a few
exceptions, it is already clear which party will win this fall in
every legislative contest from Riverside to Redding.</TE>
<TE>   That, at least, is the prevailing view among state political
experts, who say lawmakers preordained the outcomes last year by
passing a redistricting plan that heavily tilted voter registration
to favor one party over the other for most of the 100 Senate and
Assembly seats in play this political season.</TE>
<TE>   ''Elections have been abolished in California by an act of the
Legislature,'' summed up Democratic political consultant Parke
Skelton. ''There is nowhere left to turn'' but the primaries.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, influential lawmakers such as Kuehl--and some of the
state's most well-heeled special interests--are more aggressively
picking sides in primary races than at any time in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   ''Now that virtually every Democratic seat in the Legislature is
utterly safe,'' Kuehl wrote in her letter, ''we can finally turn our
attention to fighting the primary battles, heretofore off limits to
incumbents who didn't want to stick their necks out. We now have
several chances to get not just any Democrats, but the right
Democrats in state legislative seats.''</TE>
<TE>   In the most significant example, Kuehl and a loose-knit coalition
of left-leaning Democrats and traditional Democratic donors such as
labor unions and trial lawyers, are working to beat back gains by the
Democratic Business Caucus. To the chagrin of many liberals, the
group of moderate Democrats has grown in size and stature in recent
years, becoming one of the most powerful players in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   So a world away from her urbane West Los Angeles district, in
agricultural Kings County, Kuehl has entered the fray in a Democratic
Assembly primary pitting a prominent farmer, Jim Crettol, against a
slightly more liberal congressional aide, Nicole Parra. And quite a
nasty little fray it is. When the Crettol campaign made an issue of
Parra's financial support from ''lesbian members of the
Legislature,'' Kuehl shot back, dubbing Crettol ''Jim Cretin.''</TE>
<TE>   A similar fight is taking place in Los Angeles, where differing
Democratic factions are backing rival candidates to replace former
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), who is being forced
out by term limits. ''The business community got involved in
Democratic primaries a few years ago. What you are seeing is the left
wing and organized labor getting involved to counter what they see as
the excessive power of the mods,'' said Senate Republican Leader Jim
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga</TE>
<TE>   There also are numerous primary battles where lawmakers are coming
down on opposing sides according to ethnic or racial lines. They
include the southeast Los Angeles contest to replace Assemblyman Carl
Washington (D-Paramount), which features an experienced African
American politician, former Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally, and two Latinas,
Paramount Mayor Diane Janet Martinez and communications union Vice
President Alexandra Gallardo-Rooker.</TE>
<TE>   Some, including Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson, regard the surge in
Democratic primary battles as a healthy sign of the party's diversity
of opinion. But others worry that the primary squabbles are turning
divisive, and could lead to a loss of unity in November that could
create opportunities for Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   ''Frankly, there should not be arrogance from either party. When
either party thinks they can take a seat for granted, that party is
going to be in trouble,'' said Assemblyman John Dutra (D-Fremont), a
leading member of the business-oriented Democrats. "It's amazing to
me how people think these are all safe seats now. I don't think it's
healthy for there to be competition among Democrats. The business
Democrats are not in competition with Democrats, we are in
competition with Republicans.''</TE>
<TE>   Legislative contests have ultimately always been about one thing:
Republicans and Democrats jousting for control of the Senate and
Assembly. That is the reason the parties and their benefactors pump
millions of dollars into the races every two years.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats now have a stranglehold on both houses--50 of the 80
seats in the Assembly, and 26 of the 40 seats in the Senate--and
given the latest redistricting, no one, including Republicans,
expects the Democrats' grip to loosen anytime soon. If not for the
state budget, which requires a two-thirds vote and thus needs
Republican support, the GOP would be flirting with total irrelevance
in the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our sights are set much lower. We're not going for 41 seats
anymore,'' said Matt Rexroad, the strategist overseeing Assembly
races for the California Republican Party. He said the GOP's more
modest goal this year is to gain a few seats, not a majority of the
80-member house. ''Even in a tidal wave year'' for Republicans
statewide, control of the Legislature appears out of reach for the
near future, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans too are watching as established incumbents and
some of their stronger candidates have to run against one another, a
consequence of redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego and Riverside counties, conservative Assemblyman
Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta) is seeking the same state Senate
seat as moderate Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel (R-Poway). The seat
formerly did not include Hollingsworth's home, but now does. In north
Los Angeles County, a similar contest pits Assemblyman Phil Wyman
(R-Tehachapi) against Sharon Runner, wife of the incumbent,
Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster). Wyman moved into the area
after redistricting changed the makeup of his district.</TE>
<TE>   Political veterans expect the trend to continue well into the next
decade, until population shifts scramble the handiwork of
Sacramento's political map-drawers.</TE>
<TE>   ''There are usually less competitive races right after
redistricting, and then over time the district demographics change
and become more competitive,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore John
Burton (D-San Francisco). ''But because of term limits, there are
open seats, and that always makes for competitive primaries.''</TE>

<HD>FBI Ranks Moorpark 7th-Safest Among State's Smaller Cities</HD>
<DH>Crime: Incidents have dropped more than half since 1991 in
a town noted for schools, culture and recreation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with California's enclaves for the rich and its well-armed
prison towns, the Ventura County bedroom community of Moorpark ranks
as one of the state's safest cities.</LD>
<LD>   The crime rate of Moorpark, a family-oriented community of 32,000
created during the 1980s, ranks seventh of 341 California cities with
at least 10,000 residents, according to an analysis of the FBI's
latest Uniform Crimes Reports.</LD>
<LD>   "Lots of police officers live here, and lots of firefighters, and
lots of families too," said Moorpark Mayor Patrick Hunter, a
lieutenant for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "The man
across the street is a policeman and the man moving in next door is a
fireman. We're interested in the same things everybody else is--a
safe community, good schools and little traffic."</LD>
<TE>   On a Metrolink line to Los Angeles and adjoining Simi Valley, the
safest large city in America, Moorpark has grown sixfold in two
decades, building expensive planned communities from peach and
apricot orchards and on the hillsides surrounding the agricultural
Tierra Rejada Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the affluent white-collar city ranks behind only the
exclusive San Francisco Bay Area communities of Hillsborough and
Moraga, the pricey Los Angeles County towns of San Marino, Sierra
Madre and Palos Verdes Estates--and Soledad, a Salinas Valley farm
community with a state prison as its main employer.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark ranks just ahead of Rancho Palos Verdes, oak-studded
Saratoga in the Silicon Valley and Avenal, a dusty prison town in the
San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The cities' crime rates reflect the ratio of population to eight
categories of crime--murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary,
theft, auto theft and arson.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI compiles crime totals each year for thousands of cities
and counties across the U.S. Its most recent report reflects crime in
the year 2000. Moorpark's crime report for 2001, released this week,
shows that crime has dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just a lot of good people here, trying to do the right
thing," said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Bob LeMay, who serves as
Moorpark's police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly effective, he said, are Moorpark school and city
recreation efforts that provide afternoon and evening programs. "But
in fairness, you have to look at the composition of this community,"
LeMay said. "We're largely a bedroom community. And you tend to see a
smaller crime rate in those kinds of areas."</TE>
<TE>   LeMay, who moved his family to Moorpark last year, said the
fast-growing city also benefits from good homes, churches, schools
and service organizations. "Healthy communities have all of those,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like neighboring Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks in eastern Ventura
County, Moorpark is a prime destination for disenchanted San Fernando
Valley residents seeking better schools and a manageable, small-town
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   They come to a spotless community known for its high school
Academic Decathlon team, its community college, cultural arts center
and quaint town center--but little else beyond strip malls and
industrial parks.</TE>
<TE>   There are few retail shops and no big-box stores, except Kmart.
The city's only movie theater is closed. That helps keep crime low,
officials say. Shopping malls often lure criminals, and entertainment
venues invite out-of-town visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look beyond the statistics," said Hunter, who was
born and raised in the San Fernando Valley and moved to Ventura
County in 1986. "We have a very low fear factor. We have joggers late
at night and early in the morning. People use the parks all the time.
While statistics can be misleading, the absence of fear is not."</TE>
<TE>   Sleepy Moorpark is getting safer all the time, bucking a state and
national trend of crime rates beginning to rise last year after a
decade of decline. Since 1991, Moorpark's crime rate has plummeted
from 22.8 per 1,000 residents, to 9.9 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting about a town our size, in a safe community
like ours," Hunter said, "is we have so few crimes that it enables us
to analyze each one to prevent a reoccurrence if it's a trend."</TE>
<TE>   LeMay said Paul Ferruzza, a deputy in his 26-officer city
department, works a special enforcement assignment to quash emerging
crime trends.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes to the hot spots and puts the fires out," LeMay said. "If
we're experiencing vehicle burglaries in an area, he'll [work in
plain clothes] and make it a project....If we're experiencing
tagging, as we did on occasion last year, we'll make that a project
and hold those people responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark once had a significant youth gang problem, but that has
abated, LeMay said. As a result, felony violence has dropped from 87
offenses in 1991 to 40 last year. Aggravated assault, a crime
frequently linked to gang problems, fell from 72 to 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have the major [gang] players in custody or they may have
moved out of the area," LeMay said. He cited diligent detective work
by Sgt. Jim Bollington, who tracks the whereabouts of gang members as
a deterrent. "Nothing was done in the last year to turn this around,"
LeMay said. "It's just been a continual thing to stay on top of it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Suzanne Bloch, 94, a musician and teacher who worked to expand
interest in early music, died Jan. 29 in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of conductor Ernest Bloch, she was born in Geneva and
moved to the United States with her family in the early 1900s.</LD>
<LD>   At an early music concert in Paris in the mid-1920s, she heard the
lute, an ancestor of the guitar. Taken with the delicate sound of the
instrument, she studied music in Paris and Berlin over the next
decade, eventually learning other early music instruments such as the
recorder, and began her professional career in England in 1935. She
made her American debut a year later at Carnegie Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Bloch often played chamber music with noted scientists, including
Albert Einstein. But as Bloch's sister, the late photojournalist
Lucienne Bloch, once recounted, Einstein's efforts were not always
successful. "Suzy would give the downbeat, but Einstein always came
in late," Lucienne Bloch wrote. "Finally, in an exasperated tone, she
turned to him and said, 'Mr. Einstein, can't you count?'"</TE>

<HD>Trial of Priest  on Sex Abuse Charges to Begin</HD>
<DH>Court: Many adults he counseled as children decades ago are
expected to testify in the case. He maintains his innocence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his years as a priest, Donald Kimball won over parents and
children in Santa Rosa with an edgy youth outreach program that
blended Top 40 hits with Bible teachings.</LD>
<LD>   Children regularly sought advice from the "disc jockey priest." He
became known nationally for his ability to reach troubled youths.</LD>
<LD>   But many children he once counseled decades ago will be his chief
accusers at a sexual abuse trial scheduled to start Tuesday in Santa
Rosa.</LD>
<TE>   Expected to last two months, the trial will include testimony from
dozens of witnesses, among them ex-priests and alleged victims, and
will focus attention on another scandal in a Catholic diocese.</TE>
<TE>   The former youth minister is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl
in 1977 and molesting a 13-year-old girl four years later. If
convicted on the three counts, he faces a potential 12-year prison
term.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball, 58, an inactive priest since the late 1980s, has
maintained his innocence. His attorney, Chris Andrian, has claimed
that the allegations are based on a mix of fantasy and questionable
memories recovered during therapy.</TE>
<TE>   But the two alleged victims,  now mothers in their 30s, as well as
several others who allegedly suffered abuse, are expected to testify
that Kimball was a compulsive sexual predator who cloaked his desires
under priestly garb.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Rosa Diocese two years ago apologized to four of
Kimball's alleged victims and paid them $1.6 million to settle a
sexual abuse lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   With scandals involving pedophile priests surfacing in parishes
across America--the most recent implicates 80 priests in the Boston
Archdiocese--some Santa Rosa residents expressed relief that
Kimball's trial could end a sad chapter in their diocese's history.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the last in a series of scandals that have forced the
financially hobbled diocese to pay out $5 million in recent years to
settle sex-related lawsuits involving five priests.</TE>
<TE>   The scandals reached the diocese's highest levels two years ago
when a former bishop, G. Patrick Ziemann, resigned after being
accused of coercing another priest into having sex with him.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said the diocese has regained trust by making
many reforms, including the creation of a sexual misconduct
committee. One sign of growing public support was a successful fund
drive that stunned pastors--more money was raised this year than in
previous years. And church attendance, officials said, has not
dropped off.</TE>
<TE>   "People have gone a long way in their healing process," said
Deidre Frontzak, a diocese spokeswoman. "I think we are starting to
see people ... move forward and look toward the future."</TE>
<TE>   But others said forgiveness is impossible, and still expressed
anger that the diocese failed to act on questionable conduct despite
telltale signs of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents just shrug their shoulders, 'Oh, this couldn't happen in
my church,'" said Ellen Brem, one of Kimball's alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, the Catholic Church has a pretty good tally of
wrongs ... and for people to blindly follow the Catholic Church ...
it's frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Expected to testify at the trial is the diocese's former bishop,
who has testified that Kimball admitted to him in the late 1980s that
he improperly touched children.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. John Steinbock said he did not report the alleged abuse
to police because he believed Kimball posed no danger at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were able to file charges more than two decades after
the alleged offenses because of a 1999 state Supreme Court decision
that eliminated the statute of limitations for certain sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The children met Kimball when he was widely popular for his hip
youth outreach efforts in this San Francisco suburb. Particularly
appealing was a radio show he hosted that played pop songs and
blended the lyrics with Bible teachings.</TE>
<TE>   His unconventional approach appealed to everyone. Parents credited
him with keeping children out of trouble. And his methods proved
irresistible to children.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a bit of a rebel himself within the church, and that sort
of had appeal with the kids," Brem said. "They thought, 'Hey, I don't
get along with my parents. And he doesn't get along with the
church.... That's cool.'"</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victims said Kimball turned on them after they had
sought his help. Kimball served as an associate pastor at
Resurrection Parish and later as the administrator of a high school
youth ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Agbayani was 14 in 1977 when Kimball allegedly raped her on
the floor of a chapel after a Saturday night Mass. At the preliminary
hearing, Agbayani said Kimball's breath smelled fruity from wine and
afterward he told her, "You're a woman now."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous sexual encounters followed, Agbayani alleged. After she
got pregnant, she said, Kimball arranged for an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Agbayani said she reported the alleged abuse to a priest, but he
dismissed her. The priest, now deceased, allegedly told her that
people wouldn't believe her because she was from a troubled family.</TE>
<TE>   The second victim, Brem, was 11 when the alleged abuse began. She
said Kimball once took her to the Russian River where they
skinny-dipped. And when seeking advice because a boy was pressuring
her to have sex, Kimball took her to his bedroom and molested her,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Agbayani and Brem are expected to testify, along with as many as
half a dozen others who will detail alleged abuse. Prosecutors said
charges were not filed in those cases in part because they took place
in other jurisdictions.</TE>

<HD>A Stroll Through the Past</HD>
<DH>History: Tours of the renovated Camarillo Ranch House are
designed to convey what life was like for the city's founding family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stroll through the recently renovated Camarillo Ranch House gives
visitors a sense of what life was like more than a century ago for
city founder Adolfo Camarillo and his descendants.</LD>
<LD>   Vintage photos--of family, weddings and Camarillo's famous white
horses--line the walls of the 1892 three-story Victorian home.</LD>
<LD>   Situated on about 67 acres that were once part of the original
10,000-acre Rancho Calleguas, one of the last Mexican land grants,
the millionaire rancher's house, barn and stables are parallel to the
Ventura Freeway near Flynn Road.</LD>
<TE>   The residence was home to Camarillo descendants until 1997, when
it and the surrounding land were sold for development. As part of the
deal, the city of Camarillo acquired the buildings and 41/2
surrounding acres in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tangible, historic community asset," said John Fraser,
the city's liaison to the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the city formed the nonprofit Camarillo Ranch
Foundation to oversee the property, and plans for renovation were
soon underway.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 6,000-square-foot home was modernized through the
years, it had not received a complete restoration until now.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely due some attention to detail," ranch manager
Gary Blum said. "Not only did it have to be made structurally sound
for earthquakes, the electrical, plumbing, heating and
air-conditioning all needed to be updated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit of irony that I have this connection and here I am
restoring this house," said Blum, a Camarillo descendant. Blum's
great-uncle, Alfred Petit, married Adolfo and Isabella's daughter,
Rosa Camarillo. Blum also serves as site supervisor of Oxnard's
Heritage Square.</TE>
<TE>   When the city completed the structural and exterior improvements
to the Camarillo house, the Camarillo Ranch Foundation started work
on the interior and the landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   After two years, 10,000 volunteer hours, 43 contractors and $1.5
million in state grants, city funds and private donations, the house
was reopened late last year.</TE>
<TE>   The historic residence is open for free tours every Saturday from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tours will be expanded to Wednesdays and Sundays
from noon to 4 p.m. beginning in April.</TE>
<TE>   The docent-led tours wend through the first two floors of the
house. The first floor has been restored to represent the time period
1892 to 1914, and the second floor reflects changes the house
underwent after 1915 as the Camarillo children became adults.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the restoration was to refinish and refurnish the
house to capture its original look. Interior decorators went by
photographs and samples of original wallpaper found in the hallways,
kitchen, upstairs powder room and ranch office.</TE>
<TE>   The downstairs features a front and back parlor, office, dining
room, breakfast room, study, kitchen, bride's room (formerly the
maid's bedroom) and utility room, which has a walk-in refrigerator
from 1915.</TE>
<TE>   Ascending the redwood stairs, visitors see the master bedroom,
nursery, four additional bedrooms, two powder rooms and a bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   The gardens are rented out for weddings and receptions. Meeting
space in the house is also available for rent. A gift shop in the
former stables behind the house is operated by the foundation during
tours and special events. When restoration is complete on the barn,
it also will be available for rent.</TE>
<TE>   "Our general idea is to make it usable for 300 people," said Pat
Distad, Camarillo Ranch Foundation president.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been a phenomenal success," Blum said. "Almost our
entire summer is booked for 2002 with weddings and receptions, so now
we can focus on making Camarillo Ranch a focal point for the business
community."</TE>

<HD>It's Back to a Closed Primary for Most Voters</HD>
<DH>Election: Independents will get to choose a ballot. Most
others will see only candidates of their party affliliation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California voters casting ballots in the March 5 elections are going
to find they have far fewer choices than they did under the state's
short-lived "blanket" primary system.</LD>
<LD>   No longer will everyone, regardless of party affiliation, get the
same long ballot listing every candidate in every party, as they did
in the 1998 and 2000 primaries.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, Democrats will get ballots listing only Democratic
candidates, Republicans only Republicans and so on.</LD>
<TE>   But there is an important, potentially far-reaching feature in the
new system that gives independent, or "decline to state," voters
wider latitude than those affiliated with a political party.</TE>
<TE>   Once barred from any partisan primary, independents now can pick a
ballot that lists only propositions and nonpartisan contests--or they
can choose a partisan ballot of one of four parties, including
Republican and Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday is the deadline to register to vote or to switch
affiliation in a primary system whose rules have become about as
constant as sand on a wind-swept beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very concerned that confusing new state election laws will
result in unintended consequences, including much greater opportunity
for misunderstandings and errors on the part of voters and precinct
poll workers alike," said Conny McCormack, Los Angeles County
registrar, in announcing a campaign to improve voter awareness of the
latest set of rules and other changes likely to produce confusion.</TE>
<TE>   (Among them is a change that allows voters to register up to 15
days before an election, instead of closing the rolls at 29 days.)</TE>
<TE>   Voters shook things up in 1996 by overwhelmingly passing
Proposition 198, a state ballot initiative that threw out the "closed
primary" system that had been in effect for nearly four decades.</TE>
<TE>   Under that system, only those affiliated with a political party
could help choose that party's nominees; independents were limited to
voting on ballot measures and in nonpartisan races.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of Proposition 198 predicted that an open primary system
would improve voter interest and produce more centrist candidates for
the general elections in November.</TE>
<TE>   Critics dubbed it the "free love primary" because it allowed
voters, including independents, to skip all over the single,
all-inclusive ballot with no fidelity to party identification,
choosing a Democrat for one office, a Republican for the next, and
perhaps a third party candidate for the next.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the state's Republican and Democratic parties, along
with two minor parties, teamed up to file suit, arguing that the open
primary corrupted their nominating processes. Parties should have the
right to have their nominees chosen only by those who share their
political views enough to affiliate with them, they argued.</TE>
<TE>   Two lower courts refused to overturn the blanket primary, but in
June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such a system violates
the political parties' constitutional right of free association.</TE>
<TE>   So, for now at least, it's back to the closed primary--with one
important exception. Lawmakers determined to salvage at least part of
the open system passed legislation allowing independents to vote in a
party primary, so long as the party agrees to permit such voters to
help nominate its candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican and Democratic parties, along with two so-called
minor parties--the American Independent and Natural Law--all notified
the secretary of state that they would permit unaffiliated voters to
choose one of their ballots. Three other minor parties--Green,
Libertarian and Reform--will not.</TE>
<TE>   To distinguish the current system from its predecessors, elections
officials have labeled it the "modified closed primary." McCormack
quipped that she and other registrars prefer to think of it as the
"slightly ajar primary."</TE>
<TE>   Political scientists say it will take an election cycle or two to
see how the semi-closed system will affect the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Most expect there will be an increase in independent voters as
people realize they have greater flexibility in choosing candidates
than if they affiliated with a political party.</TE>
<TE>   They probably will also be increasingly targeted by campaign
strategists, especially by centrist campaigns in tight primaries,
where independents could make the difference, said UC Berkeley
political scientist Bruce Cain.</TE>
<TE>   Cain analyzes California's experience with the blanket primary in
his book "Voting at the Political Fault Line," to be published this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned from our blanket primary experience that
independents tend to go where the action is--if there is a tight race
on one side and not on the other, they will go vote in the tight
race," Cain said. He found they also tend to vote for popular
incumbents and for moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Cultivating independent voters and encouraging them to vote in a
partisan primary "is a real opportunity for moderate candidates,"
Cain said.</TE>

<HD>Emily Harris Freed on Bail in SLA Murder Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emily Harris, a former member of the Symbionese Liberation Army
charged with murdering a church volunteer during a 1975 bank robbery,
was freed Sunday on $1-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, 54, of Altadena, now known as Emily Montague, was released
from a Sacramento jail, her attorney and jail officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Harris is one of five former SLA members charged with killing
42-year-old Myrna Opsahl during the Crocker National Bank robbery in
Carmichael in April 1975.</LD>
<TE>   "She was very thankful to her family and friends for gathering the
large amount of money and equity needed for her release," said her
attorney, Stuart Hanlon. "She's got a lot of support from people who
believe in her."</TE>
<TE>   Hanlon said his client spent Sunday with her friends and family at
a Sacramento hotel.</TE>
<TE>   A Sacramento Superior Court judge set bail for Harris and her
ex-husband, William Harris, 56, at $1 million each. Michael Bortin,
53, also accused of the killing, remains in jail after being
extradited from Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Another defendant in the case, Sara Jane Olson, 55, was sentenced
Jan. 18 to 20 years to life in prison for a failed bombing attempt
against Los Angeles police officers in 1975, and is not eligible for
bail.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth defendant, James Kilgore, has been a fugitive since the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Hanlon said Emily Harris' supporters paid 10% of the bond and
secured the rest with equity from seven houses.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Bourdon, who represents William Harris, said his firm
still is trying to raise the $1-million bail, and that he will ask
for a reduced bail at a Feb. 25 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrises were convicted of the 1974 kidnapping of newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst and served about eight years each. Hearst,
47, is expected to testify for the prosecution in the Opsahl murder
trial. She was granted immunity in the case and described the crime
to FBI agents in 1976.</TE>

Chapman Avenue about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. He was later arrested
without incident at his residence, Baldwin said.</LD>

<LD>The U.S. men's hockey team, a flop four years ago in Nagano with a
mediocre performance on the ice and a brutal one off it--some of the
team members tore up their rooms in the Olympic Village--are looking
like a great story this time around. After an exciting 2-2 tie with
Russia on Saturday night, sparked by a 33-save game by goalie Mike
Richter of the New York Rangers and a quick-reflex rebound shot that
tied it late in the third period by Brett Hull of the Detroit Red
Wings, the U.S. men take on Belarus today. The U.S. has a 1-0-1
record in Group D and Belarus 0-2.</LD>

<LD>Ski jumping is currently a sport of Austria, Finland and Japan, and
those are the countries most likely to emerge with spots on the
victory stand after today's K120 competition. The U.S. team will be
led by Alaskan Alan Alborn, the 5-foot-10, 128-pounder who said after
the earlier jumping competition that this probably would be his last
Olympics. Others teaming with Alborn in the joint medal effort are
Brian Welch, Tommy Schwall and Clint Jones.</LD>

<LD>The beauty and elegance of the event is usually the story line in ice
dancing, where the third of three programs, the free program, will be

as many eyes may be on the judges as the skaters, in the aftermath of
the controversy over the pairs competition and the eventual sharing
of gold medals by teams from Russia and Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The favorites are the French couple, Marina Anissina and Gwendal

<HD>U.S. Is Still Letter Imperfect</HD>

<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was another of those eye-chart leaderboards in women's alpine
skiing: ITA, CRO, ITA, with three letters conspicuously missing
again:</LD>
<LD>   USA.</LD>
<LD>   We have become gracious hosts in these Olympics, especially in
women's alpine skiing, where the once medal-hopeful American team has
been reduced to applauding respectfully as officials hand out
hardware to foreigners.</LD>
<TE>   It's not as though races have not been there for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Daniela Ceccarelli hadn't won a major race before she took
off down the Wildflower course in Sunday's super giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't she surprised in the end when her time of 1 minute 13.59
seconds was good enough for the gold medal. Croatia's Janica
Kostelic, who won the gold in the combined earlier this week,
finished 0.05 of a second behind to add silver to her collection
while Italy's Karen Putzer claimed the bronze with a time of 1:13.86.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream," said the 26-year-old Ceccarelli, who could not
even recall the last race she won on any level.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a fog for Team USA, which entered the speed events
hoping for a medal or two but leaves with a bad case of the shakes
and a dose of indigestion.</TE>
<TE>   You had to finger well down the results sheet to find the name of
Kirsten Clark, the top American finisher at 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Jonna Mendes clocked in at No. 16, and Kathleen Monahan was 17th.</TE>
<TE>   Mendes said afterward she was just happy not to lose her lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was freaked out," she said. "I've never been like that. I was
close to throwing up at the start. I was so embarrassed. I was up
there and my heart was like [pounding] in my chest."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes was a rock compared to Caroline Lalive, who is suffering
through one of the worst cases of skiing "yips" ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive, expected to contend for medals in combined and super-G,
did not finish her third consecutive Olympic race. She crashed in
Tuesday's downhill, dropped out of Thursday's combined after missing
a slalom gate and went careening off course Sunday only 14 seconds
into the race.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive's problems are largely unexplained and have left the entire
team dispirited. She has become more psyched out at the start gate
than Shaquille O'Neal at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive was among four young Americans--Clark, Mendes and Sarah
Schleper are the others--who were sent to the 1998 Nagano Games to
get valuable experience for Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Through three Olympic events, however, the erstwhile Brat Pack has
come up empty, and has even regressed in the case of Lalive, who, at
18, finished seventh in the women's combined at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she'd give anything just to finish a race. Lalive has crashed
or not finished in nine consecutive Olympic or world championship
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive declined to address her problems afterward with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a short, Olympic-issued "flash quote," she said, "The
demon in super-G is that you've got to give it your all, and
sometimes it pays off and sometimes it doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Lalive has certainly been battling her share of demons.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan, her teammate, was asked to describe what Lalive might be
going through.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even imagine," she said. "I wouldn't want to be in her
shoes. I think all of us realize what a hard time she's going
through. We're just trying to support her and get her out of this
rut."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes and Lalive are roommates and have been friends since both
started skiing at age 6.</TE>
<TE>   Mendes said the skiers' thoughts have been consumed by the
Olympics the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single day, almost every waking moment, even when I'm
sleeping, I'll wake up in the middle of the night and think about
it," Mendes said. "That was last summer, and the summer before that.
I've devoted so much of my energy toward this and so has 'Liner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's devastating."</TE>
<TE>   With two races next week in Park City and Deer Valley, there is
time for the U.S. women to salvage these Games. However, even U.S.
Coach Marian Cernigoj admits the Americans will be lucky to post a
top-10 finish in giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Kristina Koznick is a gold medal contender in slalom, but she skis
independently of the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do better than this, that's for sure," Cernigoj said. "We
planned, there's no secret about it, for two medals for the entire
Olympics. We still have GS and slalom to go."</TE>
<TE>   The news has been much better for the ski teams from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Italy scored two medals Saturday and Kostelic, the Croatian, has
reclaimed her crown as the world's best woman skier.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic, 20, has already undergone five knee surgeries, including
three since last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with the GS and slalom remaining, she has a chance to become
the first female alpine skier in history to win four medals in the
same Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it really doesn't matter," Kostelic said. "I've got two
medals, actually I don't need any more. It would really nice, but it
would be maybe too much."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic hopes her older brother, Ivica, can join the fun next
week when he will be one of the favorites in slalom.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wins a medal, we're done, man," Kostelic joked. "We might
even give up skiing."</TE>
<TE>   The American women haven't yet considered that option, but it was
getaway day in Snowbasin.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. women couldn't get away fast enough.</TE>

<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was business as usual in the men's Olympic bobsled Sunday at Utah
Olympic Park.</LD>
<LD>   There was, as usual, glory for Germany's Christoph Langen and, as
usual, heartbreak for a United States sled.</LD>
<LD>   Langen drove like a man possessed in pursuit of the one major
bobsled gold medal that had eluded him. His track-record 47.44-third
run tied him for first with Switzerland's Christian Reich, and his
47.61-second fourth-round effort gave him the gold by 0.09 of a
second with a total time of 3:10.11.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing, it seemed, could stop Langen, not even the four mediocre
starts he had to overcome with backup brakeman Markus Zimmermann, a
replacement for the injured Marco Jakobs.</TE>
<TE>   It seems as though nothing can stop the U.S. men's bobsled team's
run of frustration, either, and the result is its 46-year medal
drought lives on. Todd Hays, rallying from a fifth-place performance
in Saturday's opening two runs, moved past fourth-place Pierre
Lueders of Canada with a 47.63 final run and total time of 3:10.65.</TE>
<TE>   Hays believed that would be good enough to hold off third-place
Martin Annen of Switzerland. But Annen, who led Hays by 0.09 of a
second entering the fourth run, produced a blazing 4.79 start--0.03
faster than Hays' takeoff, and beat him for the bronze by that same
0.03.</TE>
<TE>   The near-miss was devastating for Hays, but even tougher for
brakeman Garrett Hines, who missed a bronze medal by 0.02 on Brian
Shimer's four-man sled in 1998 in Nagano, Japan. Hines was so
distraught he declined to speak to reporters, leaving the
explanations to Hays.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to sting a long time," he said. "I don't know a worse
place in sports than fourth place in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We had all intentions to come here today and win the bronze
medal. I'm kind of shocked Annen came back the way he did."</TE>
<TE>   Poor driving in the first run Saturday and a poor start in the
second one was more than Hays--who was making his competitive Games
debut--could overcome Sunday, despite producing a tie for the
third-best run and a final run better than everyone else but Langen.</TE>
<TE>   "I got more mentally composed and drove like I could, but it was
too late," said Hays, who will compete in the four-man bobsled Friday
and Saturday. "That's bobsled. I just didn't do the job yesterday,
and that's all there is to it.</TE>
<TE>   "But I got four runs under my belt here and learned a bit. I'm
excited about next week. I generally do a little better in four-man
and hopefully will then."</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old Langen drove with a small lucky pig charm on his
uniform zipper, but his driving skill makes luck unnecessary. He won
the four-man gold medal in 1998, but got only the bronze in two-man,
matching the third-place he got in two-man in the 1992 Albertville
Games.</TE>
<TE>   He fiercely coveted a two-man gold medal and showed it at the end
of his gold-clinching fourth run, pounding his fists on his sled in
jubilation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only gold medal I've missed in my career--the two-man
at the Olympics," he said. "It was a super race."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>After watching the 2-2 tie between the United States and Russia on
Saturday night, it's easy to understand the NHL's reluctance to
commit its players to future Winter Olympic ice hockey tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   It has a little to do with the interruption required in the NHL's
season during February, the compacted schedule before and after the
Olympics to make up for lost time and the controversy--such as the
one involving the Kings, Ziggy Palffy and Slovakia--over which
players will be available to teams having to play in the qualifying
round.</LD>
<LD>   It has a lot to do with the style of play in the Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   It is better.</TE>
<TE>   Much, much better.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the notes I took about Saturday night's game.
More speed. Faster pace. No fighting. Better flow. More creativity.
More flair. This is what it's like to see Sergei Fedorov really play.
More offensive. More exciting. More fun. No fighting. Higher
intensity. Players appear to want to be here. The Great Gretzky would
have been Greater if he had played in more Olympics. More fun. Less
jostling. Beautiful puck control. Fewer stoppages. Fuller use of the
ice. I can't wait to see Jaromir Jagr play. No fighting.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the NHL has so many misgivings. Its game, at least
during the regular season, is slow, dull and lifeless in comparison.
How can you go back to Calgary-Carolina when you've seen the
U.S.-Russia?</TE>
<TE>   There are a number of things the NHL could do to improve its game.</TE>
<TE>   Enlarge its rinks. The Olympic ice sheet, conforming to the
international standard, is 15 feet wider than in the NHL. Coaches
such as Herb Brooks of the United States and Viacheslav Fetisov of
Russia are more willing to open up their offenses, avoiding the
dreaded neutral-zone trap and allowing their players to take
advantage of their skills and to be more innovative in their
playmaking. Dump and chase is foreign at the highest levels of the
foreign game. You can actually see plays requiring three and four
passes developing.</TE>
<TE>   Reason the NHL won't: Money. Some North American arenas are built
to accommodate the larger ice, but not all. One that isn't is Staples
Center. Installing the international ice sheet would require
eliminating the first three or four rows of very expensive seats.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule fewer games. It's phenomenal how good these players are
when they are rested, energetic and committed. It's not that they
aren't committed during the NHL season, but 82 games--not including
exhibition and playoff games--take a toll on the body and the mind.
Sometimes the spirit is willing, but that's all.</TE>
<TE>   Reason the NHL won't: Money. Without a lucrative television
contract, the NHL depends more than other professional leagues on
attendance. The more games there are, the more fans there are in the
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Contract. There are eight teams remaining in the Olympic
tournament. Most of the world's best players are still involved. It's
like the old NHL with the original six teams. Now that was some good
hockey. Most of the world's best players also play in the NHL, but
they are spread out today over 30 teams. Players are in the NHL who
obviously don't belong.</TE>
<TE>   Reason the NHL won't: Money. The league expanded to 30 teams to
cover more of the continent, including the U.S. South, Southwest and
West, where children don't exactly grow up skating on frozen ponds.
But sports fans spend money in those places too, so why not try to
get into their pockets? Owners also aren't allergic to the
multi-million dollar expansion fees demanded of new teams.</TE>
<TE>   Change rules. There are some rules in the Olympics that the NHL
should adopt. Take icing, for example. In the NHL, the whistle
doesn't blow to stop play until the puck is touched after it has been
iced. In the Olympics, play stops as soon as the puck crosses the
goal line. Also, the referee doesn't allow jostling, elbowing and
maneuvering for position before faceoffs. He drops the puck and the
game is on. The most welcome rule change would be the elimination of
fighting. Players who do it in the Olympics are ejected. Period. As a
result, there is no need for teams to employ goons.</TE>
<TE>   Reason the NHL won't: Money. It might make some alterations, but
don't look for the league to eliminate, or even actually discourage,
fighting. Most league and team officials are convinced that the
Neanderthal portion of their fan base would stop attending games if
there were no fighting. But isn't it possible that the game without
fighting would attract a new fan base?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's probably too much to ask for the NHL to reform.</TE>
<TE>   So I guess we should just enjoy this tournament every four years.</TE>
<TE>   It's a penalty-killing Jeremy Roenick protecting the puck like
it's his first-born child. It's Fedorov playing like we weren't sure
he still could. It's Scott Young taking a two-line pass (would the
NHL crumble if it allowed two-line passes?) behind Russian defenders
and just missing a breakaway goal. It's Atlanta Thrasher
rookie-of-the-year candidate Ilya Kovalchuk proving that Russia is
still producing the world's more creative young players. It's Brett
Hull having room in front of the goal to display his beautiful
goal-scoring skill. It's a 20-minute period taking 26 minutes to play
instead of the standard 38 to 40 minutes in the TV timeout-diluted
NHL. It's ice hockey at its best.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing I didn't like about Saturday night's game was that
there was no overtime. That doesn't start until the medal round. I
wanted to see more.</TE>
<TE>   It was the best hockey game I've seen since, well, four years ago
at the last Winter Olympics.</TE>

<DH>Even 22 Years Later, Eric Heiden's Gold Rush Stands Alone</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Strange as it sounds, Eric Heiden says the magnitude of his
speedskating gold medal sweep at the 1980 Lake Placid Winter Games
hasn't yet sunk in.</LD>
<LD>   No matter that he made history by becoming the first athlete to
win five individual gold medals in one Games. Or that in the five
Games since, no one has come close to such domination of the sport.</LD>
<LD>   Or that 22 years have passed since his triumphs.</LD>
<TE>   Heiden still sees himself as he was in 1980, a floppy-haired
21-year-old from Madison, Wis., who took up speedskating because he
liked to chase his younger sister, Beth, around the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like just a few years ago," Heiden said last week,
looking little different at 43 besides some threads of gray in his
thick, dark hair. "It really hasn't set in. You look at these great
athletes and to think you're part of it, it seems pretty strange."</TE>
<TE>   Skating over the outdoor track in front of Lake Placid High on the
town's main street, Heiden set Olympic records in the 500, 1,000,
1,500 and 5,000. He also set a world record in the 10,000 despite
oversleeping the morning of the race because he was too excited to
rest after watching the U.S. hockey team's upset of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics were a little different then," he said of the
open-air oval and the tiny host city that formed the backdrop for his
medals. "They've grown, for better or worse."</TE>
<TE>   Heiden is attending the Salt Lake City Winter Games as the
orthopedic doctor for the U.S. speedskating team. He was asked to
participate in the opening ceremony as one of the final torchbearers
in a parade of U.S. Winter Olympic gold medalists, but he declined
because he said he wanted the honor of lighting the caldron that
holds the flame during the Games. That distinction went to the
members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Heiden seemed churlish for refusing a lesser role in the ceremony,
but he has always taken the road less traveled and cared little about
what others thought of him.</TE>
<TE>   After he shattered his previous best time in the 10,000 by 15
seconds to win his last race, he stunned reporters and those eager to
anoint him a hero by claiming the rewards were insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather get a nice warmup suit or something," he said. "Then I
could use it. The medals don't mean that much. The effort I put into
the races is what's important. The medals will probably sit where all
the rest are, in my mom's dresser, gathering dust."</TE>
<TE>   True to his word, Heiden kept only two of his medals--in a closet
at his home. He believes the three others are in the linen closet of
his parents' home in Madison.</TE>
<TE>   He left the sport after Lake Placid, returning to the University
of Wisconsin and later going to Stanford medical school. He took up
bicycle racing, winning the 1985 U.S. pro championship and a year
later joining the first U.S. team to compete in the Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   After medical school he became an orthopedic surgeon at UC Davis
Medical Center. He and another doctor work with athletes at the
university, in addition to caring for the Sacramento Kings and
athletes from U.S. Cycling and U.S. speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always looked forward to giving something back to the
sport," he said. "I looked at doing it as a physician as an
opportunity to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports meant a lot to me. A couple of years ago, after I
completed my residency, I worked with the Dutch, and that opened the
eyes of the U.S. team that Eric Heiden was available, and I've had a
lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran U.S. skater Chris Witty credited Heiden with helping her
cope with mononucleosis.</TE>
<TE>   "We made some changes in her training," Heiden said. "We said her
coaches could keep the quality of her training up, but they'd have to
change the quantity. She's a unique person. She doesn't let things
bother her.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing with Chris is she has mono and you don't want to
get her too fatigued. The coaches want to make sure her workouts are
high quality, not high quantity. The fact she's a sprinter makes it a
little easier than if she skated the 5,000 meters."</TE>
<TE>   Heiden still skates and has even tried out racing's latest
technology, clap skates. But he tries to resist the temptation to
offer skaters coaching tips. "I usually bite my tongue because I
don't want to get in the way of the coaches," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the U.S. speedskating contingent, which has already won
five medals, he believes it will continue to flourish here despite
the pressure of high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's hard when people expect big things from you
because it puts pressure on your ability," Heiden said. "Some
athletes look at that competition as something they're used to doing
for years and years, and they come in well prepared."</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't expect anyone at these Games--or any other--to
match his quintuple gold feat.</TE>
<TE>   "The way speedskating is set up, with the World Cup format, you
can make a living at one distance," he said. "And you're seeing
[coaches] look for different body styles. I'd like it to happen, but
I'm more and more doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   Heiden enjoyed an occasion he considered more momentous than the
Olympics seven months ago when he and his wife, Karen, also an
orthopedist, became parents of a daughter, Zoe. He said his wife was
unaware of his Olympic feats when they met.</TE>
<TE>   Those who saw him at those Games won't forget it. And he carries
with him one distinct, if odd, memory.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds funny," he said, "but there was this corrugated tunnel
we'd go through to leave the ice, and I remember leaving the ice
after the 10,000 meters and thinking, 'I'm never going to be in this
kind of shape again in my life.'</TE>
<TE>   "And I haven't been."</TE>

<HD>Sweden Handles Czech Republic, 2-1</HD>

<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The team with the Viking ship patch on its sweater is sailing right
through some of the toughest waters the Olympics have to offer.</LD>
<LD>   Sweden won its second game of the men's hockey final round by
outlasting the Czech Republic, 2-1, Sunday at the E Center in a
matchup of the last two gold medal winners.</LD>
<LD>   The Swedes already dismantled a loaded Canadian team in the
opener, and have clinched the top spot in Group C and the No. 1
playoff seed that comes with it.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think you can start any better," Swedish defenseman
Fredrik Olausson said. "These [are] two very good teams we've
beaten."</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Salo was Sweden's goalie when it won in 1994, and Dominik
Hasek was the goalie for the Czechs' victory run in 1998. Although
they both played well Sunday, Salo was just a little closer to gold
medal form.</TE>
<TE>   He made 37 saves, including some on the best shots an inspired
Jaromir Jagr had to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference tonight was Tommy Salo," Swedish captain Mats
Sundin said. "You play in a tournament where, potentially, almost six
teams can win it. Obviously, goaltending is very, very important."</TE>
<TE>   The winning margin was a goal that Hasek allowed on a very
ordinary shot by Sundin five minutes into the second period. Sundin
slid the puck along the ice from the left side and it went between
Hasek's pads to give Sweden a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   If this were ice dancing, you might say Sundin earned this honor
based on past performance. He was the best player on the ice in a
two-goal effort against Canada and he got off to a good start
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was [shining] all season long and especially here," said Czech
defenseman Tomas Kaberle, Sundin's teammate on the NHL's Toronto
Maple Leafs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got three goals already. He's been a big plus for the
Swedish team."</TE>
<TE>   Jagr was even better, though it was in a losing cause. He squeezed
off a game-high seven shots on goal. He hustled, like when his shot
went wide off the boards and he skated to the other end of the ice to
keep it in the zone. He was even ornery, elbowing Mattias Nortstrom's
helmet askew and even shoving a linesman ("He was coming and I was
coming. That's my spot," Jagr explained).</TE>
<TE>   "He was great today," Kaberle said. " Every time he had the puck
he was dangerous for the Swedish team. He's been big for us too."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jagr: "This might be my last chance to represent my country.
It's a big tournament for me. I'm giving it my all."</TE>
<TE>   The Czech Republic's defense prevented Sweden from making the long
passes that were so effective against Canada. And the Czechs outshot
Sweden, 30-14, in the last two periods. They pulled within a goal
when Jiri Dopita scored 10 minutes 23 seconds into the second.</TE>
<TE>   But their momentum slowed when forward Martin Havlat received a
five-minute penalty and game misconduct for boarding fewer than two
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Sundin practically killed the penalty for the Czechs by himself by
picking up roughing and holding penalties, the second coming less
than 30 seconds after he finished serving the first. But even with a
faster tempo generated by the four-on-four play, the Czechs couldn't
beat Salo.</TE>
<TE>   The Czech Republic (1-1-0) could still be heard from in the
playoffs. Players from both teams said the Czechs played better over
the latter part of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how good you play, you have to win," Jagr said. "Bottom
line. Only victory [counts]. If you lose in the playoff you go home
and nobody remembers what kind of hockey you played, if you played
good or bad. Everybody remembers: do you have a medal or not?"</TE>

<HD>Ohno Expects to Race</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>U.S. short-track speedskater Apolo Anton Ohno, whose leg was gashed
in the frenetic final turn of Saturday night's 1,000-meter race, did
not lace up his skates Sunday but expects to practice today and to
race Wednesday in his next events, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "At this point it looks like all systems go," U.S. short-track
team leader Jack Mortell said in a statement released Sunday
afternoon by the U.S. Olympic Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Ohno, 19, of Seattle, won the silver medal in the 1,000 meters,
scrambling to his feet for second place after a four-man spill threw
him into the boards in the last turn of the last lap. Australia's
Steven Bradbury, who had been coasting along in fifth place, yards
behind Ohno and the others, was the only one who didn't fall; he
sailed across the finish line first and claimed Australia's first
gold in Winter Games history. Canada's Mathieu Turcotte took third.</LD>
<TE>   Both Ohno and Turcotte were cut by flashing skate blades in the
spill. Turcotte suffered a cut to his backside that made it painful,
he said, to even sit. Ohno, chasing medals in four events--the 500,
1,000, 1,500 and the 5,000-meter relay--sustained a 1-1/4 inch cut
(three centimeters) on the inside of his left thigh. He appeared on
crutches late Saturday at a news conference, his leg swathed in
bandages after receiving six stitches.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Olympic team doctor Dan Carr said officials checked on Ohno
at 11 a.m. Sunday and, perhaps most important for Ohno's racing
prognosis, confirmed that the cut appears to be only skin-deep. The
underlying muscle, Carr said, was bruised, not torn.</TE>
<TE>   Carr also said, "The wound is healing and there is only a moderate
amount of pain." Ohno, he said, was expected to ride a stationary
bike Sunday and take part in a scheduled practice at 1:30 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,500-meter event is scheduled for Wednesday. The 500 and the
5,000-meter relay will be held Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The cut is the first significant injury of Ohno's career. U.S.
team doctors Randy Vosters and Eric Heiden treated it on-scene within
minutes. Turcotte, meantime, also appeared Sunday to be "doing fine,"
though he also got "a few" stitches, Canadian Olympic Assn.
spokeswoman Natasha Larabie said. Turcotte is expected to take part
in his next race, Saturday's 5000-meter relay, she said.</TE>

<HD>Pairs Soften Stand</HD>
<DH>Canadian and Russian couples come together on podium as new
golds are given out in medal ceremony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Holding hands as they climbed to the top of the medal podium, figure
skaters Jamie Sale of Canada and Elena Berezhnaya of Russia put a
good face on an ugly moment for figure skating and the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Sale and partner David Pelletier were given the pairs' gold medals
they narrowly missed winning last Monday, when they lost a 5-4
decision to Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. A French judge on the
panel later said she had been pressured to vote against her
conscience by her country's figure skating federation, and although
she denied having been swayed, the International Skating Union
recommended the Canadians be declared co-winners and get duplicate
gold medals.</LD>
<LD>   The International Olympic Committee approved the decision, the
first time it ratified the reversal of a judgment call.</LD>
<TE>   ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta, who today will discuss the
judging scandal at an ISU executive council meeting, awarded the
freshly minted medals to Sale and Pelletier Sunday at the Salt Lake
Ice Center after the original dance phase of the ice dancing
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there were a tough few days," Pelletier said, "but now
we can put some closure to it, and we can go on and be athletes. Our
gold medal is everybody's."</TE>
<TE>   The third-place Chinese duo, Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao, were
invited to participate but chose not to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Both couples wore warmup suits with red-and-white jackets, but
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had their gold medals around their necks.
All four chatted while waiting for the blue-carpeted podium to be set
up, and Sale said she joked with Berezhnaya about the craziness of
the past week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most bizarre thing that has ever happened," Sale said.
"We're all trying to make the best of it, and we're all really
pleased."</TE>
<TE>   The two women led the way to the podium, trailed by their
partners. Both couples stood on the wide top step as Cinquanta looped
a medal around Sale's neck, and then around Pelletier's. He then gave
each of the four skaters a yellow bouquet, which they waved toward
the appreciative crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy," Sikharulidze said, "because I think now, after
all these kinds of problems, we're all happy, and I think the
audience must be happy as well, because it's the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian anthem was played, with Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze
spiritedly singing along. The Canadian anthem followed, and Sale sang
along while a weary-looking Pelletier stood still and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an exit for a situation there is no exit out of," said
Valentin Piseev, president of the Russian Figure Skating Federation.</TE>
<TE>   All four were gracious toward each other, hugging and exchanging
kisses as they posed for photographers. At one point Sale bit her
medal, as if testing to be sure it was real.</TE>
<TE>   "This was better than I expected," Pelletier said. "I think the
four of us were part of history, and that's something that is great
for the four of us.... I'm so happy that we got to share that with
Anton and Elena."</TE>
<TE>   Said Berezhnaya: "It's closed and everybody is happy, so I'm happy
too."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Cinquanta will introduce a proposal to change figure
skating's judging system, reviving a reform move that was rejected at
an ISU Congress two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's unclear whether last week's judging controversy will
make the climate at the executive council meeting more favorable
toward change. No reforms will be enacted today because rule changes
must be approved by a two-thirds majority at the ISU Congress. The
next Congress will be in June in Kyoto, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta's ideas include making judges more independent from
their national federations and tracking judges' scores by computer to
determine whether a pattern of bias appears or whether their scores
deviate greatly from their colleagues' marks. Those who fall outside
a norm would have to justify their decisions and, perhaps, face
sanctions if they can't provide a reasonable explanation.</TE>
<TE>   The French judge at the center of last week's flap, Marie Reine Le
Gougne, wants to speak before today's meeting, but French Figure
Skating Federation President Didier Gailhauget said the ISU has not
responded to her request.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne was suspended indefinitely after she did not immediately
report to ISU officials that she had been pressured to vote a certain
way while judging the pairs' free skate last Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta declined to be more specific about his proposal, saying
the council members should hear it before it becomes public. ISU
spokeswoman Aline Bussat said only that the agenda "will be
pertaining to ISU administrative matters. And yes, of course," she
added, "the issue concerning the French judge and the ongoing
investigation will be addressed."</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Do you believe in miracles?</LD>
<LD>   They do Down Under, now that Steven Bradbury has broken a 66-year
drought by winning Australia's first Winter Olympic gold medal with a
performance in Saturday's men's 1,000-meter short-track speedskating
final that was positively Biblical: He who is last shall be first.</LD>
<LD>   Bradbury, a good 20 meters behind the pack entering the final
turn, kept his distance--and, more significantly, kept his
feet--while American Apolo Anton Ohno and the rest of the field wiped
out 50 yards from the finish, allowing the back-drafting, slacking
Aussie to ease home with the gold.</LD>
<TE>   It was a classic Olympic moment, deserving of a classic Olympic
broadcasting call.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing Roy and H.G. were here.</TE>
<TE>   Australian comedians Roy Slaven and H.G. Nelson became media stars
at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney with their rollicking nightly
Olympic satire, "The Dream," which featured a rogue Olympic mascot
named "Fatso The Fat-Arsed Wombat" and Greco-Roman wrestling footage
set to a sampling of Barry White's greatest hits.</TE>
<TE>   They've brought the same format and skewed sensibility to Salt
Lake, sending nightly "Ice Dream" dispatches back to Australia's
television audience. Here is how Roy and H.G. called Bradbury's slow
glide to history:</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "Let's follow the Bradbury tilt. They start, away. Steven
drops back into the traditional Australian position in this event. He
can smell the field well in front of him. Ohno and, of course, the
wily Canadian up front of him. Steve's in good position, he can see
the field. What's his tactic here, Roy?"</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "H.G., he's just hoping there's a lot of geese in front of
him. A lot of really stupid [geese], that's what he's hoping. The
further he gets back the sillier they look."</TE>
<TE>   Lap after lap, Bradbury continues to solidify his hold on last
place. To the casual observer, the Australian looks hopelessly
outclassed by the field. But Roy and H.G., they are experts in their
field, they can see what's brewing.</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "Look, he is saving himself. He's got something special
there."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "Do you think he's tired of smelling the field, Roy? Or do
you think he can take a little bit longer? He doesn't want to make
his move too soon, we're down to two laps to go."</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "No, he's got to go further back! 'Further back, Steve!
Further back!'"</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "Does he look tired to you?"</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "He doesn't look tired, no, he's holding it all back."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "He's holding the smell. There's so much, he can't get any
closer, Roy. One lap to go. We're into the final lap, it looks like
Ohno making a tilt."</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "Look how stupid they are."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "There's a fall! They're all down! Steven came through."</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "Oh yes."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "As we watch in replay, the geese fall for the three-card
trick in the front."</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "See, they've got no technique--no technique. If you're not
on your feet, you can't win."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "They talk about a miracle on ice in 1980. I've seen another
miracle on ice tonight."</TE>
<TE>   It must be noted that "The Ice Dream" is tape-delayed.</TE>
<TE>   But then, so is NBC. Believe it or not, impressive things can be
done with canned Olympic footage.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is: NBC exists to trumpet the greatness of the
Olympic Movement; Roy and H.G. are here to slip it a whoopee cushion.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours before the taping of their Sunday night show, the
co-hosts took some time to reflect on the Salt Lake Games at the
midway point.</TE>
<TE>   * The Great Pairs Figure Skating Controversy: "The Olympic Games
has not necessarily been the greatest place for fair play," H.G.
said. "Which is fine, Roy Jones Jr. notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes it ice skating, it does appear historically there
has been a bit of collusion on the judging panel. A 'you can have
one, we can have another one' sort of thing. I'm not surprised that
has happened.</TE>
<TE>   "What's tricky about it now is that they've sort of acknowledged
that it happens--and the way that we deal with it is giving more
medals."</TE>
<TE>   * Salt Lake City: "It's sweet white bread," Roy said. "And that's
about it. If sweet white bread is your taste, then you'd settle down
here.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you like a little sourdough every now and again, or
something with a little bit of variety, a bit of brown bread, you're
going to have to go elsewhere....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what kids 14 to 19 do here. I have no idea. It must
be similar to how things were when we were kids in the '50s and '60s
in outback Australia, in rural Australia. Bored [stiff]. I imagine
they would be bored [stiff].</TE>
<TE>   "But it'd be more excruciating for them because television beams
in images of excitement and an alternative way of living that is
denied them here."</TE>
<TE>   * Australia's first Winter Olympic gold medal: "It could have
happened in a slightly different way and been anti-climactic," H.G.
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the fact that everybody fell over and he managed to stay on
his feet seems to ... there's something great about it. It's not
partially [messed up]. The whole thing is [messed up]. But he manages
to win."</TE>
<TE>   Roy said there hasn't been anything like it at the Winter Olympics
"apart from the 1980 Miracle On Ice. But I didn't think that was a
miracle."</TE>
<TE>   H.G.: "Only in hindsight was that a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Roy: "Well, Saturday night we saw a genuine miracle. A genuine
miracle!"</TE>
<TE>   H.G: "And probably only possible in Salt Lake City."</TE>

<HD>The Spirit to Go Fourth</HD>
<DH>U.S. Nordic Combined Relay Finish Doesn't Take Away Gift of
the Games</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It's still there. It took an hourlong bus trip Sunday to find it, but
it's still there.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the punks and professionals, away from the charlatans and
cheats, there still exists a Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   It was discovered in a white-blanketed valley in the shadow of
Mount Timpanogas, classical music in the air, children rolling in the
snow, the sheesh of cross-country skis across the hillside.</LD>
<TE>   A spandex lump on the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   The lump tried to stand up, but couldn't. Workers hovered over it
offering relief, but couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Fans stared at it. Skiers slid around it. The lump curled and
writhed and stood and fell again.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after it was pulled from the slick track and affixed with
oxygen and given the strength to walk away, the lump stretched out
into U.S. Nordic combined athlete Todd Lodwick.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't do it," he said softly to a reporter. "I just couldn't
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Underneath his mirrored sunglasses, he began to cry.</TE>
<TE>   "This was going to be our day to shine," he said. "But the clouds
came in and poured on us...."</TE>
<TE>   He took three steps and doubled over again in silent grief.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick's U.S. cross-country relay team, after a third-place
finish in the earlier ski jumping portion, was set to win a medal in
this sport for the first time in 78 years of trying.</TE>
<TE>   Except Lodwick lost the edge on the first five-kilometer leg
around the hilly track, and the Americans were overtaken by the
fourth-place Germans, and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, they had actually gained ground on eventual winner
Finland. But they never caught Germany or Austria, and finished a
distant fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The best finish in U.S. Nordic combined history.</TE>
<TE>   A race that ended with four guys either collapsing in breathless
despair, or wandering around in sad confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the silence of a small crowd, it felt as if it might be 78
years before they get this close again.</TE>
<TE>   But Lodwick was wrong about those clouds.</TE>
<TE>   For one painful, special hour, the light could not have been
clearer on the mission of these Games and those who dare play them.</TE>
<TE>   This was not about money. It was about four young ski bums from
Colorado, three of whom rent rooms from the locals, one sleeping for
the last three years in a converted chicken coop.</TE>
<TE>   "At least there's no more chickens," Bill Demong said. "But now I
have goats."</TE>
<TE>   This was not about popularity. There were fewer than a dozen U.S.
media members at the event, which ended with a news conference in a
room filled with empty chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it's great just to hear people cheering," Matt Dayton
said.</TE>
<TE>   This was, amazingly enough, also not about gold.</TE>
<TE>   On a day when the Olympics held a phony medal ceremony to unfairly
hand a gold medal to a Canadian pairs figure skating team that had
lost it on the ice, that concept was as foreign to these four guys as
a sandy beach.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the gold.</TE>
<TE>   They simply wanted to finish on the podium.</TE>
<TE>   After 19 skid-filled Olympics, they wanted to finish the race
standing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something about that podium, and we all talked about it,"
Demong said. "On bad days, you don't think about it. But on good
days, it makes it easier to go to bed and dream about it."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday had been one of those days. The Americans had performed
far better than expected in the ski jumping. Everything was set up
for a blitz in cross-country.</TE>
<TE>   They were finally going to elbow their way into the history books
of a sport that belongs to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the name. Is there any other sport in the Winter
Olympics named after an entire region?</TE>
<TE>   This being like Greco-Roman wrestling, any medal would have been
as large as Rulon Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists have discovered ancient Scandinavian wall carvings
showing humans racing on skis. Nordic combined contests were being
held in Norway as early as the mid-1800s.</TE>
<TE>   It's considered one of the purest and most original of Winter
Olympic activities. And something far too diverse for the
one-sport-only mind-set of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "You need the grace and courage to ski jump, and the stamina to
race," explained Dayton. "It's a very difficult combination."</TE>
<TE>   But after Saturday's ski jump, the Americans had finally figured
it out, or so they thought.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four hours later, it became apparent they had thought too
much. "We had to leave that jump feeling fantastic ... but then we
had 24 hours to deal with the pressure," Coach Tom Steitz said. "That
may have been a little part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure from an outside world that doesn't even understand the
sport?</TE>
<TE>   "No, it wasn't really about everybody else," Demong said. "It was
about us. After all this work, we wanted to do it for us."</TE>
<TE>   What a notion, to attempt to achieve something simply for one's
own sense of self. From snowboarders pushing helmet companies to
figure skaters driving Mercedes, that notion has been sort of lost
this week.</TE>
<TE>   And once they, in their minds, have failed?</TE>
<TE>   They didn't blame a judge, or the wind, or a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Each of them, individually, blamed himself.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lodwick: "I just had a bad day."</TE>
<TE>   Said Demong: "I could have saved more for the end."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dayton: "I just couldn't get it together."</TE>
<TE>   And so on....</TE>
<TE>   "That's the strength of our team," Steitz said. "If we had gotten
on that podium, they would have credited each other. But because we
didn't, they are each blaming themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Strength indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the few reporters at the news conference, Luke
Bodensteiner, U.S. Nordic director, said: "Now I know you're getting
ready to write a story about how the medal slipped away from us.... "</TE>
<TE>   Quite the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   This afternoon in the quiet hills far from maddening Salt Lake
City was about something gained.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, despite wearing faces that dropped to the floor, each
of the four young skiers ended the day by saying they hoped to return
as a team in four years in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   I want to be there when they do.</TE>

<DH>Recovering Witty Makes Her Mark With Surprise Win in 1,000
Meters</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>She couldn't do it four years ago, when a lot of people thought she
could, but speedskater Chris Witty did it Sunday, when hardly anybody
thought she would.</LD>
<LD>   Learning in mid-January that she had mononucleosis, Witty wasn't
even sure the Salt Lake City Games were in her future. Today, she's
the proud, if shocked, owner of the gold medal for the women's
1,000-meter race.</LD>
<LD>   Even more stunning to her--and to anyone else who knows what a
strength sapper mono is--the longer she skated the stronger she got,
closing fast and winning in world-record time, 1 minute 13.83
seconds.</LD>
<TE>   "If I was healthy, that time would have been a surprise," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In skating it, although she didn't know it at the time, she beat
both Sabine Voelker of Germany, the World Cup leader who had set the
old record, 1:14.06, here at the Utah Olympic Oval in December, and
U.S. teammate Jennifer Rodriguez, second to Voelker in the World Cup
standings and looked to as the great American hope, once Witty's
illness was disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Voelker took the silver in 1:13.96, Rodriguez the bronze in
1:14.24.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody was expecting that race out of Witty,"
Rodriguez said, "including herself."</TE>
<TE>   Witty could only agree.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just happy to skate," she said. "I didn't expect to win."</TE>
<TE>   Until she put on her finishing kick, in fact, there was strong
doubt she would win her race within the race.</TE>
<TE>   She was paired with Catriona LeMay Doan, the Canadian sprinter who
won the women's 500 Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really happy to have Catriona," she said. "She gets me off
the line."</TE>
<TE>   Which, in Sunday's race, was precisely what she needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the race, I felt a little fatigued, a little shaky going
to the line," Witty said. "So I told myself to relax, just focus on
skating, don't think about anything else and have a good race."</TE>
<TE>   Then LeMay Doan, even starting from the slower outer lane, got off
to one of her jackrabbit starts, which got Witty's competitive juices
flowing. The Canadian skated the first 200 meters in 17.53 seconds
but Witty was only inches behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time ever I went under 18," Witty said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she was behind, and stayed there through the first lap,
although never far off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "At 600 meters, with one lap to go, I was right with her," Witty
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had a chance. I saw Catriona in front and I was so happy
to be that close. I just chased her and chased her."</TE>
<TE>   Witty finally caught her in the last turn, passing the Canadian
coming out of the turn and powering through the finish line, setting
off a raucous crowd reaction.</TE>
<TE>   She pushed back her hood, checked her time on the scoreboard,
checked it again, then choked back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was all heart," she said of her strong finish. "It
wasn't my legs."</TE>
<TE>   As impressive as her race had been, though, it was far from won.</TE>
<TE>   In the next pair were Rodriguez and Anni Friesinger of Germany,
Rodriguez the more dangerous skater.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really excited for [Witty] but I wanted to hurry and get my
race going," said Rodriguez, the former inline skater from Miami. "I
knew that I could skate a time close to that."</TE>
<TE>   But her chance evaporated when she slipped in the first corner.</TE>
<TE>   Voelker was next, and her start was impeccable. She had a
17.60-second opener and was skating a record pace with a lap left but
couldn't match Witty's kick.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the final pair, Russian Svetlana Zhurova uncorked a 17.41
opener and was ahead of Witty's pace with a lap left.</TE>
<TE>   "That last lap was like a 10-minute lap," Witty said. "I couldn't
watch it but I didn't know where to look. I'd look at the board, then
I'd look at the track."</TE>
<TE>   And when it was over, Zhurova had faded badly and Witty was the
winner of the race that had eluded her in Nagano four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   There, as the strong, healthy star of the U.S. women's team, she
had a chance to knock Marianne Timmer of the Netherlands out of the
gold but just missed.</TE>
<TE>   No missing this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to wake up tomorrow and pinch myself," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Alsgaard Carries Norwegians to Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Thomas Alsgaard's teammates picked him up, put him on their shoulders
and paraded him around in circles near the finish line.</LD>
<LD>   They were only returning the favor.</LD>
<LD>   Alsgaard carried Norway to the gold medal in the men's
40-kilometer cross-country relay Sunday. He passed Italy's Cristian
Zorzi in the home stretch and gave the Norwegians a victory in the
event for the third time in the last four Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   The Italians won the silver and Germany got the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   For the third consecutive Olympics, the world's premier
cross-country event was decided by a little more than a ski tip--and
all of the close calls have involved Norway and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason it always come down to Norway and Italy in a
sprint," Alsgaard said. "That's tradition .... If I would have lost
it, it would have been a disaster. So we're happy."</TE>
<TE>   The United States took fifth--its best showing in the
event--behind John Bauer, Kris Freeman, Justin Wadsworth and Carl
Swenson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to stop European-worshiping, as I call it," Freeman
said. "We know how to race. You can be as good as you want to be ...
and I think we're showing that now. The United States is coming."</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegians won without Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, who has won
three gold medals in the biathlon but was passed over for one of the
four legs of competition because he had already raced more than 46
miles at these games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not an easy decision because we have so many good skiers,"
teammate Anders Aukland said.</TE>
<TE>   The move almost cost Norway the race.</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Skjeldal, chosen in place of Bjoerndalen, surrendered a
23-second lead over Italy in the third leg.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got the task, I said, 'I just have to do my best,'"
Skjeldal said. "We'll never know how Bjoerndalen would have done.
Maybe better or maybe not as good because he skied [Saturday] and
could have been tired."</TE>
<TE>   The Italians closed on Skjeldal and forced a frantic finish.</TE>
<TE>   Zorzi, possibly the best sprinter in the world, passed Alsgaard as
they entered the arena. But Alsgaard, who said a day earlier that he
couldn't defeat the Italian in a sprint, went back in front and
pulled away in the last 100 meters.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I am the weakest part of the team," Skjeldal said. "If
Thomas would have lost, in a way, I would feel a little bit
guilty.... I was almost flying when I saw Thomas beating him in the
last 100 meters."</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegians--Aukland, Skjeldal, Alsgaard and Frode
Estil--covered the Soldier Hollow course in 1 hour 32 minutes 45.5
seconds. Zorzi finished three-tenths of a second behind Alsgaard.</TE>

<DL>OGDEN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Skip Kari Erickson made two difficult shots late as the American
women curlers stayed in contention for a medal by beating Britain,
6-5, Sunday in extra ends.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing, 5-3, in the last end, or inning, Erickson knocked out a
British stone and made hers stick inside the scoring circle near
another U.S. stone. That gave the U.S. team two points and a 5-5 tie
at the end of regulation.</LD>
<LD>   In the 11th, Erickson again made a shot that gently bumped the
British stone and put herself in scoring position.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't give up. We are tough until the end," Erickson said. "I
couldn't have asked for anything more after I threw that shot."</TE>
<TE>   The win gives the United States a 5-3 record with one game
remaining. Britain is also 5-3. Canada has clinched a semifinal spot
at 8-0 and Switzerland is in second place at 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Japan beat Russia, 7-6, and Norway beat Denmark,
9-4.</TE>
<TE>   The United States meets Norway (4-4) today.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow's game is as big as this one. We just have to take a
deep breath and start over," Debbie McCormick said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. men were beaten by Finland, 6-4. The U.S.
(3-5) is out of medal contention.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was playing well against us. We just got outshot," U.S.
skip Tim Somerville said. "We were playing tough but not good
enough."</TE>
<TE>   In other men's games, Britain beat France, 7-3, Canada beat
Norway, 9-4, Sweden clinched a semifinal berth with a 5-4 win over
Germany and Switzerland beat France, 7-3.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</LD>
<LD>   Which can only mean the topic of discussion is ice dancing.</LD>
<LD>   The order of the top 11 couples after Sunday's original dance was
identical to the order after the first phase, the compulsory dances.
Anyone want to venture out on a limb and predict the order will be
the same after tonight's final phase, the free dance?</LD>
<TE>   Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France, bronze medalists
at the 1998 Nagano Games, were first. Irina Lobacheva and Ilia
Averbukh of Russia--who got the evening's only perfect 6.0, from the
Polish judge, for presentation--were second. World champions Barbara
Fusar-Poli and Maruizio Margaglio of Italy were third, with Shae-Lynn
Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada fourth.</TE>
<TE>   There was no discernible bloc voting by the judges, who are from
Poland, Italy, Lithuania, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Israel, Germany,
Bulgaria and Russia. Anissina and Peizerat, who won the European
championship after losing the Grand Prix Final to Bourne and Kraatz,
were ranked first by all but the Polish judge, who gave her
first-place vote to Lobacheva and Averbukh.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was the best performance we did this season," Anissina
said. "We are always progressing, and anytime we skate, it's getting
better and better in the competition."</TE>
<TE>   The original dance counts for 30% of the final score. Couples
created a dance to a prescribed rhythm, the Spanish Medley. They're
free to use any kind of music in tonight's free dance, which is worth
50% of the final score.</TE>
<TE>   Lobacheva and Averbukh, performing to tango and flamenco music,
were spirited and fast. Although they missed part of the season
because of a knee injury suffered by Lobacheva, they peaked Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was the best performance of our lives," Averbukh said.
"Now we are ready for good skating. Now we are ready for
competition."</TE>
<TE>   Fusar-Poli was much happier than she had been Friday, when she
complained the marks given to her and her partner for the compulsory
dances were too low.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm satisfied," said Fusar-Poli, who had a worrisome moment when
her scarf got caught under one of her blades but escaped without
harm. "Of course, I'm just a little mad for the results of the
compulsories because we did a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Said Margaglio: "We tried to do our best and take out our rage."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev stayed 11th, but
the other U.S. entry, Beata Handra and Charles Sinek, dropped a spot
to 21st.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a blast out there," Lang said after the couple performed
to a medley of the paso doble and flamenco. "The crowd supported us
through the compulsories [where they felt their scores were too low]
and that was great. It doesn't matter what the marks are, as long as
the crowd is happy....</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we're in 11th place, but we feel like we're winners."</TE>

<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>So far, the Canadian team expected to bring home a gold medal is
bringing on one of the worst cases of nerves in the nation's hockey
history.</LD>
<LD>   And if lowly Germany could inspire the tentative, inconsistent
performance given by Canada Sunday night, just wait until the
Canadians see Dominik Hasek staring at them from the opposite goal
crease.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Sakic scored midway through the second period as Canada
struggled to a 3-2 victory over Germany, getting its second troubling
performance from a star-laden roster that shows no signs of the
cohesiveness necessary to win the tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a tense time," Canada Coach Pat Quinn said. "We're having
trouble dealing with the tenseness."</TE>
<TE>   Canada's team of NHL millionaires traveled to Utah shouldering the
dreams of a hockey-mad nation held without gold for 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians' roster is one of the most spectacular ever
assembled, but their physical talent hasn't translated into smooth
team play--and they admit time might be running out.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to gain some confidence," defenseman Chris Pronger
said. "We've got to relax. You don't always have to go-go-go and try
to make every single play. We don't have to do everything."</TE>
<TE>   Canada's victory sets up a key match against Hasek and the Czech
Republic today. The winner likely will face Finland in the
quarterfinals Wednesday, while the loser probably will get the
daunting task of meeting Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Through all of the struggle, there also was plenty of reason for
Canadians to hope their team will find its way. Paul Kariya and Adam
Foote scored on chances created by an effective five-minute power
play for Canada (1-1)-- a 5-2 loser to Sweden on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians began and ended the game playing sloppy hockey, but
during 20 minutes spanning the second and third periods, Canada was
in charge. After Sakic slipped a shot past goalie Marc Seliger for
the game's first goal, the Canadians added two more goals in the next
10 minutes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A truism from the land that embodies the Winter Olympics' newest
trivia question: We Australians love our international heroes as only
an isolated island nation of 18 million can.</LD>
<LD>   When he wins another Academy Award, or another Golden Globe, or
becomes the object of affection of another smitten and beautiful
co-star, he is Australia's Russell Crowe. When there is trouble in a
bar; when Meg Ryan goes home crying; when his latest epic turns out
to be a dud, he is New Zealand-born Russell Crowe.</LD>
<LD>   So it would have been, up until the final seconds of the Winter
Olympic men's short-track 1,000-meter skating final at the Salt Lake
Ice Center Saturday night. Brisbane's Steven Bradbury was a gallant
fifth in his last race in Olympic competition, so far off the pace he
was barely in the same camera frame; his parents got to see him in
the country's colors with the five interlocking rings for the first
time, and everyone would have gone home content, nonexistent
expectations happily unfulfilled.</LD>
<TE>   And suddenly, everything turns upside-down on the final curve,
with the front-runners sliding every direction except forward. The
last man standing crosses the line first.</TE>
<TE>   If you ever want a pictorial definition of the word 'abashed,'
study the expression on Steven Bradbury's face in that instant.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, too, far away at the other end of the Pacific
Ocean, in the waning days of summer, a transformation takes place.</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of the rest of the country, he is no longer theirs,
which is to say, Brisbane's, but ours--Australia's Stephen Bradbury,
the unlikeliest Olympic gold medalist in any season since Anthony
Nesty of Surinam touched out Matt Biondi of the U.S. in the 100-meter
butterfly at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of luck on my side," Bradbury said. "I don't think
I'll take the medal as the minute and a half race that I won. I'll
take it as the last decade of the hard slog that I've put in and a
reward for effort."</TE>
<TE>   The four-time Olympian said he intentionally skated from behind in
all of his races, hoping crashes would take out his opponents and
maybe then he could win a bronze. His strategy succeeded in the
quarterfinals, when two skaters crashed and Bradbury advanced. In the
semifinals, two opponents went down and another was disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   By this morning in his homeland, Steven Bradbury was the radio
quiz-show answer to a question his compatriots never thought they
would hear: Who is the first Australian Winter Olympic gold medalist?</TE>
<TE>   For double bonus points, they could answer the follow-up: And
where is he from?</TE>
<TE>   In Australia, that answer is more like a punch line.</TE>
<TE>   Brisbane is Houston in terms of climate, and somewhere in Kansas
for culture and politics.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't produce many bleached, ear- and nose-ringed,
spiky-haired, thunder-thighed Winter Olympians. It loves rugby league
and its newly minted Australian Football League champions, the
Brisbane Lions. It won't know what to do with Steven Bradbury, who
had trained for his final Olympic Games in the type of blessed
obscurity about which Jamie Sale and David Pelletier could only
dream.</TE>
<TE>   Winter in Brisbane is an endless succession of days in the 60s.
Sometimes it gets wet and the Brisbane River floods. The city's
contribution to international culture consists of a pop duo called
Savage Garden.</TE>
<TE>   For a country so notoriously sports-obsessive as Australia
generally is, the Winter Olympics remain a European and American
oddity, as culturally and geographically distant as the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Games fall at the wrong time of the year, for one thing, which
is to say, during the hottest period of summer. The country has just
returned to work after slumbering through January. The winter
sporting obsessions of footy and rugby are cranking up. Ice, when it
can be found, floats at the top of a gently perspiring glass.</TE>
<TE>   For this, among other reasons, it's fair to say that short-track
race did not bring the country to a standstill. Truth told, few
Australians would have known they had an interest in the final.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, I rang my parents, who live near Melbourne.
They said the Seven network, which holds the Olympic rights until
2008, was showing a package of two hours of Olympic highlights and 60
minutes of ads, every night. Those especially committed could get up
at 4 a.m. to watch live coverage of the skiing.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Australians' progress, the extent of my parents'
knowledge--and for the sake of this account, that will be considered
typical of the country--was that that girl, whatsername, was coming
second in one of those skiing events.</TE>
<TE>   She qualified second in the aerials, the final of which takes
place today. Barring the unforeseen, therefore, she is Melbourne's
Alisa Camplin.</TE>

<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Finland won its second consecutive Nordic combined gold medal of the
Olympics by adding to the big lead it built during Saturday's ski
jumping and then coasting to the gold in the 20-kilometer
cross-country relay at Soldier Hollow.</LD>
<LD>   The Finns, who entered the Games without a gold medal in the
jumping-racing hybrid since 1948, finished the relay in 48 minutes
42.2 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a fantastic ski-jumping competition, but maybe there is
more pressure when you are leading," said Samppa Lajunen, who won
last week's individual event, with teammate Jaakko Tallus taking
silver.</LD>
<TE>   Germany used a late surge by Ronny Ackermann to catch Austrian
rival Felix Gottwald for the silver medal, 7.5 seconds behind the
Finns. Austria got the bronze, 11 seconds back.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. finished fourth--1 minute 11.9 seconds behind the
winners. They were a surprising third after the jumping at Olympic
Park, sparking hopes of not only bettering the team-best
seventh-place showing in 1994, but getting that elusive medal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. fell to 0 for 24 in Nordic combined events all-time, but
tried to take solace in its fourth-place finish in Sunday's team
competition--the closest the Americans have come to a medal.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no consolation," said Todd Lodwick, who started out
quickly on the first leg but soon faded. "For the last four years,
we've been trying to work up to this one day, and it didn't happen.
The clock is stopped. We can't do anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tom Steitz, who has marveled at the strides the team has
taken since finishing 10th of 11 teams in Nagano, preferred to look
on the bright side.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now it's tough to look at it as a positive," said Steitz,
"but when I took over [in 1992], the press conference was over before
the team made it to the finish line."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. started six seconds ahead of Japan and 17 seconds ahead
of the fast-skiing Germans. However, Bjoern Kircheisen soon caught
Lodwick.</TE>
<TE>   "After three kilometers, I realized there was a lot of pressure,
and that Todd was getting a little tired," Kircheisen said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Demong, who followed Lodwick, said it appeared Lodwick used
up too much energy on his fast start.</TE>
<TE>   "He went out fast and made up a lot of time," Demong said of
Lodwick. "But this is the kind of course where you need to save
something."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. trailed by more than 37 seconds when Lodwick handed off
to Demong, but Demong did well on his 5k leg, cutting the Germans'
advantage to 12 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Spillane couldn't keep it up. He gave back nearly 42
seconds on his leg, and by the time he tapped anchor Matt Dayton, the
U.S. team was out of medal contention. "We were looking for something
with a silver or bronze color to it, so I'm a little disappointed,"
Demong said. "I feel like I left something out there."</TE>
<TE>   Finland, led by the strong-jumping Lajunen and Tallus, began with
a 44-second lead over Austria.</TE>
<TE>   The first three Finns increased the lead to more than 50 seconds,
giving Lajunen plenty of cushion to bring home the victory.</TE>

<LD>Brakeman Gea Johnson, the central figure in a bobsled controversy
that shattered a friendship but formed a medal-contending duo, has an
injured left hamstring and might not be able to push for Jean Racine
in the top-ranked U.S. sled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If Johnson pulls out, the substitute will be Bethany Hart--not Jen
Davidson, whom Racine dumped in December after luring Johnson away
from Bonny Warner's sled. The Racine-Davidson breakup was
well-publicized because the duo had attracted $500,000 in
endorsements and was expected to be among the Winter Games' marquee
performers.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Roy, executive director of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton
Federson, said Sunday that while Johnson is likely to compete, the
federation is monitoring her status.</LD>
<TE>   "All the latest information I have from everybody who is involved
is that Gea is going to race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A source with knowledge of the situation said Racine wants Johnson
to back out and allow Vonetta Flowers to take her place, even though
Flowers made the U.S. team as a brakeman with driver Jill Bakken.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States Olympic Committee rejected any possible
Racine-Davidson reunion Sunday night, saying Davidson was not
eligible because she did not compete in the Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   "If Gea Johnson is not able to compete as the push athlete for
Jean Racine, the only possible replacement is Bethany Hart," USOC
spokesman Mike Moran said.</TE>
<TE>   Names of each duo must be submitted after today's training and
before tonight's race draw. The source also said the U.S. Bobsled and
Skeleton Federation has begun the paperwork to replace Johnson with
Hart.</TE>

<TE>   The U.S. hockey team's 2-2 tie with Russia on Saturday night,
shown live by NBC except in the West, generated a 7.2 national rating
with a 20% share of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   It was the highest-rated hockey telecast, Olympics or NHL, since
1980, when ABC's taped-delayed coverage of the U.S. Olympic team's
"Miracle on Ice" upset victory over Russia drew a 23.9/37 and the
ensuing gold-medal game against Finland got a 23.2/61.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's game got a 5.2/17 in Los Angeles, even though it
was delayed three hours in the Pacific time zone. Sacramento got an
8.4/26.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first nine nights of the Olympics, NBC is averaging an
18.4/30 across the nation in prime time, a 12% increase over the
16.4/27 CBS was averaging from Nagano, Japan, after nine nights in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shea, the late patriarch of the only family to produce three
generations of American Olympic athletes, was honored with the U.S.
Olympic Committee's highest award.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic Torch Award was given posthumously to Shea, a double
gold-medalist in speedskating at the 1932 Winter Games. Shea was
killed in an auto accident just before the start of the Salt Lake
City Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Shea Sr. was a skier in the 1964 Winter Games, and his son,
Jim Jr., is a skeleton racer on this year's team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After 13 knee operations, 13 years on the World Cup circuit and
nine Olympic and world championship medals, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg
has raced enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Today was very likely my last day. I don't think I will race any
more. This Olympic race is my last," the 31-year-old Wiberg said
after finishing 12th in the super-G.</TE>
<TE>   She won three Olympic medals in three different events at three
different Games: 1992 giant slalom gold, 1994 combined gold and 1998
downhill silver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials have filed a protest with the International
Skating Union over the disqualification of speedskater Satoru Terao
in the men's 1,000-meter semifinals on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Terao and China's Li Jiajun became entangled and fell, with
Canada's Mathieu Turcotte also in the bumping. Terao was disqualified
for impeding. Turcotte and Li advanced to the finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese are not seeking to have the semifinal run again, but
want Terao's disqualification overturned.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the natural majestic mountain peaks to the high-tech, man-made
speedskating rinks capable of regulating temperature to one-tenth of
a degree, there is much to be admired in these Olympic Games. Camera
angles offer the world vicarious wins and defeats that surpass the
thrills of any video arcade. Yet, somehow, this author expects more
from the living and breathing Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   The contests and security rule the headlines. The ancient games
also were based on contests and born in uncertain times. Pugnacity,
cruelty and folly in the ancient Greek era were so rampant that
humans of wisdom looked for a way to reach out to one another.</LD>
<LD>   The Games were originally associated with religious festivals,
held every fourth year and signaled a period of non-warring and
mutual acquaintance.</LD>
<TE>   A thousand years followed of heralds' quadrennial sounding the
"Call to the Games" and announcing this "Truce of God" throughout the
Greek peninsula. It afforded the warring parties wholesome moments
during which they could objectively analyze and negotiate old
grievances and new issues.</TE>
<TE>   When will the General Assembly of the United Nations consider an
Olympic truce for the world?</TE>
<TE>   Today the Games embrace not one peninsula, but the whole globe.
The first Games of the new millennium need to deliver an
extraordinary call for global togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, Eternal Wisdom itself brought them to Salt Lake City,
whose pioneering spirit is engraved in history. One hundred and fifty
years ago, the Mormon settlers in Utah awoke the powers of water from
clear mountain streams to return to fertility the baked soil they
plowed. Now, the Olympics need to awaken the powers of optimism from
reasonable humans and help turn the soils of despair into those of
active hope.</TE>
<TE>   The world believes the Olympics enhance the realization of human
kinship. Indeed, the sentimentality of the opening ceremony creates
in the multinational audiences all-embracing feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Then, sadly, amid the "going for the gold" that has since become
the Olympics' main purpose, those feelings evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Utah Symphony, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the
gentle art of the welcoming spectacle promised to Light the Fire
Within--it is hoped, the fire of all-global friendship. For the more
than $1 billion that these Games will cost, the Truce of God ought to
be reflected as well.</TE>
<TE>   The awesome financial expenditure also calls urgently for a
commitment to making it worthwhile. The leafy twig that breathes
oxygen, the moonlit eye of a coyote, the schoolhouse that introduces
knowledge, and the sporting event that embraces the world, all play
irreplaceable parts in the great Games of Survival and must not be
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, turn your eyes to the suffering of nature and to the
river of tears shed by the world's mothers who lost their progeny to
violence, and you may see more clearly that the message of the
Olympic Games must be about brotherhood and sisterhood as well as
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of years have passed since the first Summer Olympics in
Athens in 1896, and the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France, in
1924. Their studious originator, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, had
concluded that the political and armed struggles in 19th-century
Europe were similar to those of the ancient Greek city-states, and
embarked on a campaign to restore the Olympic Games as a way to build
respect and communication among friends and foes in the modern times.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, De Coubertin's name is mentioned less and less. He
believed, for example, that Olympians should come from the amateur
ranks and upon their return home forever bear witness to the
possibility of international understanding and mutually respectful
communication.</TE>
<TE>   But today's reality is different. Many countries that take part in
the Olympic Games do not offer affordable sporting opportunities to
the masses. Many aspirants to Olympic greatness live and train far
away from their countries and, when victorious, continue to battle
for medals and monetary rewards as a career.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, I believe that De Coubertin's ideals cannot be lost. They
live in Olympic villages where one begins to see the world as
something larger than one's self. They thrive within the crowds of
receptive minds where a gesture, a smile, or a helping hand reinforce
the fact that all people are equal.</TE>
<TE>   The time has arrived that in order to maintain their morality, the
Olympic Games must become an opportunity for wondrous healing and
mutual appreciation of all human endeavors--Games in which we all can
participate.</TE>

<KH>FIGURE SKATING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Slutskaya Might Change Program</HD>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russia's Irina Slutskaya, who became the first woman to land a
triple-triple-double combination jump at last year's world figure
skating championships and barely missed pulling that feat off twice,
might try something even tougher this week in the women's
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Practicing at the Salt Lake Ice Center Sunday for the first time,
Slutskaya toyed with a triple salchow-triple loop-half loop-triple
salchow combination. If she lands the unprecedented move, it could
boost her technical scores in a competition that promises to be
close.</LD>
<LD>   Slutskaya demurred when asked if she will incorporate the move
into Thursday's long program, saying, "I practice lots of things."</LD>
<TE>   But she is known for her willingness to push the sport's technical
limits. Slutskaya, considered the top rival to Michelle Kwan for the
women's gold medal, became the first woman to land a triple
lutz-triple loop in competition at the 2000 Grand Prix Final.</TE>
<TE>   And her triple salchow-triple loop-double toe loop at the world
competition last March was remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "I really want to try something interesting," Slutskaya said
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya and several other Russian skaters arrived in North
America about a week ago but went to Logan, Utah, to train before
going to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   She said the practice sessions in Logan, where the altitude is
similar to Salt Lake City's, has helped her fitness.</TE>
<TE>   "I practiced good [Sunday]," she said. "I am all ready for
competition.... Everyone say, 'Irina, you want to beat this one and
this one,' but it's sport. I can win. I can lose. Life is always
changing.</TE>
<TE>   "I can stand here and say, 'I will win,' but this is not true.
This is not right. It's sport. It's ice. It's not floor."</TE>
<TE>   She watched the pairs competition and said of fellow Russians
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze: "They are Olympic
champions." But she refused to be drawn into the judging controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a judge. I like how the other pair [Canadians Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier] skated," she said. "One pair was good on one
side, one pair was good on the other side. I will just worry about
myself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the blind draw held for the starting order of Tuesday's short
program, Kwan came out with the best position among the three U.S.
competitors and Sarah Hughes with potentially the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes drew the fifth starting position in the field of 27, just
before Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel. Kwan will skate 15th, in the
same warmup group as Slutskaya (13th) and Maria Butyrskaya of Russia
(12th).</TE>
<TE>   Most skaters dislike skating early, because judges tend to be more
conservative and save their higher marks for any dazzling
performances that might come later.</TE>
<TE>   A perfect example of a skater hurt by drawing an early start was
Michael Weiss of the U.S., who drew first and skated well but got
lower scores than he might have if he had been among the final
skaters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya has spent the last few days at the athletes' village,
popping tapes into a VCR to help her improve her already good
English, and generally enjoying the atmosphere. She was assigned a
roommate, Russian pair skater Maria Petrova, but isn't thrilled with
the arrangement because Petrova's competition is over and Slutskaya
wants to concentrate on her upcoming event.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope she will leave today, and I will stay alone," Slutskaya
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kwan said Sunday she's enjoying the Salt Lake City Games more than
she enjoyed Nagano, partly because she marched in the opening
ceremony and has spent some time in the Olympic Village. She skipped
the ceremony four years ago to get treatment on an injured foot, and
while in Japan stayed in a hotel with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole experience, just being a little wiser, a little calmer,
and also not taking anything for granted," she said of what's better
this time around. "This is a great moment in my life.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the opening ceremony. That's something I did miss out on,
and I didn't realize how much I missed. I see Apolo [Anton Ohno],
Daron Rahlves, Picabo Street now, and I'm cheering for them. At
Nagano, I didn't know who a lot of the U.S. athletes were. Now, it's
so personal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robin Wagner, who coaches Hughes, said their decision to
reconfigure the last 90 seconds of Hughes' long program has paid off
in several ways. Hughes will still perform to Ravel's "Daphnis et
Chloe," but a section of music by Rachmaninov has been removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It adds a little more variety and shows off a little more of her
line, graceful qualities and quickness," Wagner said. "She loves it.
It gave her something new to work on, something fresh."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner also said she's not concerned the judging controversy from
the pairs event will carry over to the women's competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not quite sure what we can do to change things, but hopefully
we can," she said. "It [questionable judging] has been in figure
skating for years and years."</TE>

<LD>Tick, tick, tick. When might we expect the next U.S. medal in alpine
skiing?</LD>
<LD>   Through six events, Bode Miller's silver medal in combine stands
alone as the only American alpine posting. Bill Marolt, president of
the United States Ski and Snow Assn., has promised 10 medals from
American skiers and it's a good thing he's counting snowboarding and
freestyle skiing toward that total.</LD>
<LD>   Marolt's snowboarders have accounted for five medals, while
freestyle has chipped in two.</LD>
<TE>   Americans have been a relative bust in alpine. Daron Rahlves
failed to medal in downhill or super-G. Picabo Street struck out in
her last race in the women's downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Lalive was expected to contend for medals in combined and
super giant slalom. But she withdrew from the combined after missing
a gate and finishing 17.85 seconds off the lead in the first slalom
run, and in Sunday's super-G she crashed 14 seconds into her race.
Lalive has crashed or not finished in her last nine world or Olympic
starts.</TE>
<TE>   America's remaining alpine hopes rest with Miller, who will be a
contender this week in slalom and giant slalom. The U.S. will also
gladly take credit for anything won by Kristina Koznick, who left the
team to train independently.</TE>
<TE>   She'll be one of the favorites next week in slalom.</TE>
<TE>   It has gotten so bad that American reporters are turning to
foreigners for internal assessments.</TE>
<TE>   After winning his second gold medal Saturday, Norway's Kjetil
Andre Aamodt urged Americans to keep plugging.</TE>
<TE>   "Bode Miller was pretty close on my heels in the combined," Aamodt
said, "and he's going to be dangerous in the next two events, which
are his best events."</TE>
<TE>   The Mountain of Love</TE>
<TE>   When volunteer gate judges Gary Wright and Jena Haldeman decided
to get married at the top of the downhill course, all they had to do
was find a preacher--with an Olympic credential.</TE>
<TE>   Security was an obstacle since only people with
credentials--issued months ago--are allowed on the Mount Ogden
course. The lovebirds finally found a ski patroller who is an
ordained minister.</TE>
<TE>   "We intended to just escape to Las Vegas, but this is a lot more
romantic," Haldeman said before Sunday's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing their Olympic volunteer uniforms, the couple exchanged
vows, then took a trip back down the aisle--skiing down the mountain
together.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the Beef</TE>
<TE>   Vegetarians and other finicky eaters are starving at the
beefeaters' Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   There are beef hot dogs, beef chili and even the vegetable soup is
made with beef stock at the concession stands.</TE>
<TE>   No veggie burgers in these mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The limited menus have caused grumbling fans with rumbling
stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   One man yelled "I'm starving!" from the middle of a line waiting
for the shuttle after a three-hour luge competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Upscaling" was not part of the Olympic food plan, said Don
Pritchard, director of food services. Hauling food, water and cooking
equipment up a steep ski hill proved difficult and too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "If people say this is basic, they are right on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Way too basic for many.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a world-class event; you'd think they could have some
fish or some garlic chicken or something," John Gould said at Utah
Olympic Park. "Ten or 15 years ago you expected crummy food, but now
lots of sports have upscaled it."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Deer Valley, a resort known by foodies for such
treats as soy-glazed sea scallops, were so displeased with the low
Olympic standards that they set up their own food tent--offering
caesar salad, turkey chili and cookies.</TE>
<TE>   All venues offer nachos, soup, muffins, glazed nuts and beef
products. Some of the indoor venues offer more choices, including
popcorn and pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Strohl, from Ohio, doesn't eat beef. "This is cattle country
here," he said. "If we were in Lake Placid, I guarantee we'd have
different things to eat."</TE>
<TE>   It's a Tough Sell</TE>
<TE>   She's an older woman, probably in her 60s. Sweet and kindly
looking, her pleasant face and white hair could make her anybody's
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   She has come to Terry Hatton's ticket-selling business in downtown
Salt Lake looking for seats for the men's figure-skating final.
Hatton tells her all he has are D-level seats--the nosebleed section.
She sighs.</TE>
<TE>   "They look so small from up there," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She is almost to the door when she stops and looks back.</TE>
<TE>   "Interested in men's hockey?" the woman says. "Quarterfinals. I've
got four. A hundred-seventy-five each."</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Olympics are in town and everyone, it seems, is
selling.</TE>
<TE>   The woman produces her tickets, and Hatton's partner, John
Kassatz, takes a look. They're $250 face value, but the problem is
that no one knows which teams will be in which quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I knew who was playing," Kassatz says, studying the
tickets as though they hold the secret of eternal youth. "If the U.S.
is playing, it's a $500 seat. If it's Sweden-Finland, I'm taking a
bath."</TE>
<TE>   Kassatz looks a little longer, then says, "Terry, are we
dice-rollers?" Hatton nods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give you $650 for the four," Kassatz says.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty dollars less than she's asking. And $350 less than face
value.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll shop around and come back," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Kassatz quickly says. "I'll give you $175."</TE>
<TE>   He's going to gamble. If he gets either the U.S. or Canada, a 25%
chance, he wins.</TE>
<TE>   In another respect, however, Hatton and Kassatz are taking an even
bigger gamble. Tickets are plentiful, but no one is buying.</TE>
<TE>   Scalping is a time-honored practice at big-time sporting events,
and the Salt Lake City Games are no exception. Unlike many parts of
the country, scalping is legal in Utah as long as you register and
get licensed by the city's public business license department. Hatton
is one of two dozen or so licensed vendors working inside a converted
storefront. But for every Hatton, there are four unlicensed ticket
sellers outside. And they crowd the four corners of Main Street and
200 South, the nexus of ticket scalping right in the heart of Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Adolfo Corsi has come from Florence, Italy, to scalp, as he has
for every Olympics since the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. His weathered
face is in agony. He has never seen business so bad.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing here," he says. "Look"--and he waves his hands
at the intersection--"100 scalpers. And no one buying."</TE>
<TE>   The previous day, Corsi patrolled the parking lot at Utah Olympic
Park, site of ski jumping. It was the morning of the K120 event, what
Corsi calls the "king of winter events."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, it's a sure-fire moneymaker. Corsi was able to buy $190
tickets for $10 ... and could not resell them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disaster, a catastrophe," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He'll get no argument from Malcolm. Malcolm is another veteran.
He's from Texas. A cardboard sign reading "Tickets" dangles from his
neck on a piece of string.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm scalped at the Subway Series in New York in 2000, and says
he was hassled by police. He too says business is lousy.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't made any money," he says. "The hotel is $200 a day.
They're killing me. A $30 room for a deuce. It's a joke, man--$95
tickets are going for $20. I'm getting killed."</TE>
<TE>   Another interested party on the corner is Richard Montoya, an
agent with the city's licensing department, dressed in a blue uniform
and carrying a summons book.</TE>
<TE>   "They save me a lot of trouble when they knock it off," Montoya
says of the unlicensed scalpers. "That's the purpose of being
visible, to let them know I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Standing a few yards from Montoya, Corsi is lamenting his fate
when a small, scruffy, 20-something man approaches.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Corsi puts his arm around the young man's shoulder and starts to
steer him down the street. "Let's take a walk over there, my friend,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Olympics. Time to deal.</TE>
<TE>   Last Words</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there's a worse place in sports than fourth place
in the Olympics. It's going to sting for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hays, U.S. driver, after he and brakeman Garrett Hines
finished fourth in the two-man bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I didn't have the legs to match the other guys. I was at
the back of the field hoping for an accident."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Bradbury, the Australian speedskater who went from worst to
first when the other four competitors crashed ahead of him just short
of the finish line in the 1,000-meeter short-track final Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to be in her shoes. All of us realize what a hard
thing she is going through."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. skier Kathleen Monahan, after teammate Caroline Lalive fell
in the super-G, her third crash of the Olympics.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Johann Olav Koss visited Eritrea, an African country torn apart
by decades of civil war, he saw the living conditions of the children
and promised to return five months later, after the 1994 Winter
Olympics. When Koss did return, he marked himself as an Olympic
idealist.</LD>
<LD>   When Koss, a Norwegian, won three speedskating gold medals at
those Lillehammer Games--in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meters--and
set world records in all three events, he marked himself as an
Olympic legend.</LD>
<LD>   In the eight years since then, Koss has marked himself as
something much more. He is a modest humanitarian, a man of his word,
a physician by training, an altruist by nature.</LD>
<TE>   Now 33 and living in Toronto with his wife, Belinda Stronich, Koss
has done what he promised in Lillehammer. He is the head of Olympic
Aid, an athlete-driven, not-for-profit humanitarian organization
begun originally by the Lillehammer Olympic organizing committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission," Koss said, "is to use the idea of sport and of play
to help children in areas where they've known only violence and war
to develop into healthy, happy people."</TE>
<TE>   Koss said that Olympic Aid has about 100 volunteers, mainly in
Africa and Asia, helping children. Koss himself hopes to visit
Afghanistan as soon as possible to institute an Olympic Aid program.</TE>
<TE>   After the '94 Olympics, Koss donated his gold-medal bonus money to
the movement, and returned to Eritrea to present both money and
sports equipment he had collected from the children of Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Koss retired from skating after the Lillehammer Games and went to
Australia, where he earned his medical degree from the University of
Queensland in Brisbane. He had gone to Australia to finish school and
to be with his girlfriend at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Koss always kept his hand in Olympic Aid, taking time to speak at
fund-raisers and attend committee meetings whenever possible. In
1999, his relationship with his girlfriend over and his medical
schooling complete, Koss became the full-time director of Olympic
Aid.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife at an Olympic Aid meeting in London and moved to
her home, in Toronto, so he could be with Stronich and her two
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Koss said, "we are providing sport in the most
disadvantaged areas of the world. We are working in more than 15
countries at a grass-roots level. We have been cleared by the United
Nations to begin looking for volunteers to bring to Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Koss has been to Bosnia, flying in a military plane to 1984 Winter
Olympic host city Sarajevo; in Rwanda, where war was going on around
him, and in Sudan. "I've never felt really in danger," Koss said.
"What I felt was love from the children who all seemed to know what
the Olympics are."</TE>
<TE>   Koss is in Salt Lake City doing speedskating commentary for
several European television stations. He said that this time, as
opposed to 1998 in Nagano, he doesn't miss competing. "Four years
ago," Koss said, "I did have that big urge to be on the ice. This
time? No. Skating is in my past."</TE>
<TE>   After spraining knee ligaments less than two months before the
Lillehammer Games, Koss was not expected to dominate the Olympics.
But he did.</TE>
<TE>   Having already set two world records, Koss obliterated the world
record in the 10,000. His mesmerizing performance, in which he ticked
off 24 consecutive sub-33-second laps, brought the home-country crowd
to its feet a minute into his 13-minute 30.55-second race. It also
caused the Dutch skaters, big rivals of the Norwegians, to present
Koss a golden butterfly after the final race. It is an honor the
Dutch always had reserved for Dutch gold medal winners.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his own $30,000 prize money, Koss had his Olympic skates
auctioned for $85,000, which he also gave to Olympic Aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows the Olympics and the value of the Olympics," Koss
said. "It is an incredibly powerful tool which should be used for
good. Through sports we can teach people to understand each other, to
build bridges.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics should stand for more than excellence every fourth
year or every second year. It should provide friendship, respect,
peace and good, positive values all the time, everywhere."</TE>

<HD>A Tough Pill to Swallow</HD>
<DH>The 'dirty little secret in health care' is that many patients
ignore doctors' orders and take prescribed medications irregularly, if at
all.</DH>

<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deborah Willhite, who helped formulate the U.S. Postal Service's
response to last fall's anthrax attacks, stopped taking her antibiotics a
full two weeks before her 60-day prescription ended.</LD>
<LD>   Willhite, an agency senior vice president deemed at risk for anthrax
exposure, couldn't stand the vomiting, an occasional side effect of the
medication. The last straw was throwing up in a store parking lot while
she was loading packages into her car.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard a couple rolling by me with a shopping cart saying, 'Isn't
that the lady with the Postal Service that's on TV all the time?' " she
recalled in an interview. "That was the last day I took doxycycline."</LD>
<TE>   Willhite acknowledges that she should have been a role model for
medication compliance. But instead she acted like many American patients,
whether they face anthrax, angina or asthma: She took prescription drugs
when and how she saw fit.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't set a very sterling example, I'm afraid," Willhite said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, she was among the more compliant of the 10,000 people at
highest risk for anthrax exposure in Florida, New York, New Jersey and
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, for example, health officials say as many as half of
those prescribed anthrax antibiotics never took a single dose--even
though the disease had proved rapidly deadly and the drugs were free.
Even in Washington, where nearly everyone began their drugs, only 60% of
people surveyed said they had taken the drugs every day for 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "If your co-worker died of the disease and you know that there are
spores in your environment . . . and you still don't take the medication,
imagine how much of a bigger problem we have for things that are less in
your face, like your blood pressure and your cholesterol," said Dr.
Jerome Avorn, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School.</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown that the problem extends far and wide--to patients
who are on the verge of blindness from glaucoma and those who have just
undergone life-saving kidney transplants. Even women trying to prevent
pregnancies routinely miss one or two doses of their birth-control pills
each month.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, about 50% of people don't take medications for chronic
conditions as ordered by doctors. It's "a dirty little secret in health
care," said Avorn, who has written extensively about the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons patients cite for stopping--or never starting--medications
are varied. Some feel fine without the drugs. Some simply forget. Others
don't have money or insurance, or the side effects are too much to bear.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are many people who foul up the timing of their drug
treatment--and then try to compensate for skipped doses by taking more.</TE>
<TE>   Compliance is particularly important with antibiotics, which work by
attacking bacterial cells within the body and preventing their ability to
reproduce. If the drugs are taken inappropriately, they kill only some of
the bacteria, allowing remaining cells to thrive and develop resistance
to those antibiotics in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Completing a prescription generally kills off all bad bacteria,
removing those risks.</TE>
<TE>Studies Show Patients Lie to Their Doctors</TE>
<TE>   Doctors often take for granted that patients will take their drugs as
prescribed, but researchers have shown conclusively that such assumptions
often are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In one 1986 study, for instance, researchers placed an electronic
device in the eye droppers used by glaucoma victims. It tracked every
time the bottle was opened and turned upside down. On average, people
missed about a quarter of their prescribed doses. But in interviews,
patients said they had taken a full 97% of their drops.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have similarly shown that people lie about their habits
to stay in their doctors' good graces. In the day or two leading up to a
doctor's visit, patients tend to take their medications more religiously,
an effect some researchers have called "white coat compliance."</TE>
<TE>   When he was a young eye surgeon, Dr. Kenneth J. Hoffer of Santa Monica
said, "I just assumed that glaucoma patients would [follow directions]
just out of the fear of losing their sight. . . . [But] as time went by,
sometimes I would find that patients were lying to me."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he said, most did try to follow directions. When it became
a bother, however, patients seemed to build up "a resentment about it,"
and many rebelled.</TE>
<TE>   When patients stray, studies show, some get sicker faster and die
earlier. And taking the drugs haphazardly can lead to more health
problems than not taking them at all.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing a market, entrepreneurs have devised techniques and gadgets to
keep patients diligent. Some companies sell pillboxes with beeping
alarms, refrigerator magnets that blink, watches that vibrate, and
subscription reminder services for pagers and cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Sequella Inc. of Rockville, Md., is developing a wristwatch that can
detect the presence of tuberculosis medicine in a person's bloodstream.
TB is highly contagious, and failure to take drugs as prescribed could
cause a person to remain infectious for an indefinite period, putting
others at risk. The infected person could also develop resistance to
commonly used drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have found that patients tend to perform better when they
know they are being monitored.</TE>
<TE>   Aardex Ltd., based in Zug, Switzerland, makes a medicine bottle with a
microchip that keeps track of when the bottle is opened. Patients can't
tamper with the results unless they deliberately throw away pills or open
the bottle and then forget to take a pill.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to really manage chronic conditions, you need to know
what the people are doing with the medicine," said Dr. John Urquhart,
Aardex's chief scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies are trying to bring patients into compliance as well.
The most promising solution is to develop medications that can be taken
once a day and that don't produce harsh side effects, said Christopher
Dezii, a manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb. This is especially true for
patients with complex diseases such as AIDS, who sometimes take three
dozen pills a day, with rigid rules for each medication.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance companies, too, are concerned because studies suggest that
compliant patients have fewer emergency room visits and hospital stays.
Aetna Inc., for instance, sends out quarterly letters to 20,000
primary-are doctors listing members of health maintenance organizations
who were late refilling prescriptions for high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, congestive heart failure, asthma and diabetes medications.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna also sends an instant message to pharmacists if members come to
pick up a refill a week or more after they were supposed to.</TE>
<TE>   Even with reminders and a doctor's urging, the ultimate decision on
whether to take medicine rests with the patient.</TE>
<TE>   And fear, apparently, is not enough of an incentive, or not a lasting
one.</TE>
<TE>   Those given antibiotics to prevent anthrax, for example, had friends
or co-workers who had died, been hospitalized or developed serious,
unsightly skin infections. Anthrax-contaminated letters had passed
through their workplaces. Medications were provided free of charge. And
endless media attention didn't allow anyone to forget about their risks.</TE>
<TE>   As time wore on, though, bothersome side effects, a lack of symptoms
and relatively few deaths stopped many people from taking their drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Bender, a news assistant for the Sun supermarket tabloid,
worked less than 50 feet away from Bob Stevens, the first person to die
of inhalation anthrax last fall. Like the 400 employees of American Media
Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., he was offered a 60-day supply of Cipro.</TE>
<TE>   But Bender stopped taking Cipro after about a month because he was
seeing white spots and feeling nauseated. He switched to another
antibiotic, doxycycline, for another week, then gave up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was to the point where we had to draw a line," he said. "I don't
want to be a guinea pig. I don't think I'll ever get it [anthrax], not
from this circumstance."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Aron, a senior editor for the National Examiner, located in the
same building as the Sun, said he stopped taking antibiotics after 30
days. A death in the family disrupted his routine and he never got back
to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was one of the last people I knew who was even taking them, to be
honest with you," Aron said. "It just seemed unnecessary since no one
else was showing significant symptoms." His attitude had changed over
time.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very beginning, there was a lot of concern about how to get a
hold of the antibiotics. Our beloved co-worker had just passed away, and
we were all feeling very vulnerable. But as the test results came back .
. . and there didn't appear to be anyone else coming down with the
full-blown illness," people were less anxious to take the drugs.</TE>
<TE>Lack of Information About Side Effects Cited</TE>
<TE>   Even those who took the drugs said they could have used more coaching
and information along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lewis, president of the Trenton, N.J., local of the American
Postal Workers Union, followed through with the 60-day regimen. But when
he went for his initial set of pills, "nobody told me nothing" about side
effects or problems he might encounter.</TE>
<TE>   "I stood in a long line like anyone else, logged in some paperwork
like you do with any visit. The pharmacist handed me a bottle with
nothing written on it except, 'Cipro, two times a day, empty stomach.' .
. . I left with a piece of paper telling me to come back in two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials acknowledge some missteps. Early on, they
were most worried about getting enough antibiotics to people at risk of
anthrax infection. Educating patients about the need to take the drugs
was less of a priority--until lapses unexpectedly began.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge challenge to try to educate people appropriately. It's
not something you can do once and walk away," said Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention epidemiologist Ian Williams, who is studying
compliance among the high-risk group.</TE>
<TE>   Education, it seems, isn't all that's needed.</TE>
<TE>   Willhite, the Postal Service's anthrax point person, knew as much as
many health officials about the risk of the deadly bacteria. Yet, in the
end, she just couldn't follow through with her drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they ever thought I would quit taking it," she said.
"Hopefully, if anything like this ever happens again, there will be
something worked out that will make it more tolerable for everybody
involved."</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Not as the Doctor Ordered</TE>
<TE>Electronic monitoring used in several studies has found that patients
take their prescription drugs or use medical devices far less often
than they report.</TE>
<TE>BIRTH CONTROL PILLS: Between 53% and 59% of women said they did not
miss a single dose of their birth control pills during each month of
a three-month study. An electronic monitor found that the proportion
who took all the doses was actually 19% to 33%.</TE>
<TE>ASTHMA: On average, children with asthma reported 95.7% compliance
with orders to use a peak-flow meter twice daily. An electronic
microchip said actual compliance was 77.1% for the device that
measures the force of air a patient exhales.</TE>
<TE>GLAUCOMA: Patients reported 97% compliance with orders to use
pilocarpine eyedrops four times a day to prevent blindness. A
monitoring device in the eyedropper found a true compliance rate of
76%.</TE>
<TE>PREDICTORS OF MISSED DOSES:</TE>
<TE>These factors have been shown in several studies to lessen patientseither
adherence to a drug regimen.</TE>
<TE>    * Many prescriptions to be taken each day or single prescriptions
to be taken several times each day</TE>
<TE>    * Special restrictions (for instance, with or without food)</TE>
<TE>    * Special storage requirements (must be kept dry)</TE>
<TE>    * Drugs that interfere with lifestyle (driving, drinking, meals,
sex)</TE>
<TE>    * Poor communication with doctors</TE>
<TE>    * Strong side effects</TE>
<TE>HOW TO REMEMBER:</TE>
<TE>Researchers have found one of the best ways to improve compliance is
to connect drug-taking with a daily or weekly routine. For instance,
for a daily prescription, take the drug before you brush your teeth
every morning. Or, for a once-a-week pill, always take it before
taking out the trash.</TE>

<HD>Chew on This: Beef Jerky Is Pride of Owens Valley</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Outdoors people and travelers savor the dried strips,
which evoke a flavor of the region's pioneer past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OLANCHA, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>The first sign that you are headed into a culinary oasis is on
northbound U.S. 395, about 160 miles from L.A., at the southern edge of
the Owens Valley. Sitting on the right shoulder, amid the desert brush, a
small billboard reads:</LD>
<LD>   "Really Good! Fresh Jerky 30 Miles."</LD>
<LD>   The hand-painted sign looks like the work of an amateur, and its
message is perplexing. Can a piece of desiccated beef that resembles tree
bark really be called fresh?</LD>
<TE>   Two more billboards direct motorists to an ancient gas station on the
outskirts of Olancha (population 100). The parking lot on this winter
afternoon is filled. It's always filled.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, motorists get out of their cars, walk inside a tiny store
in the gas station, then exit holding a plain brown bag. A few quickly
drive away. Most sit behind the wheel of their parked cars, struggling to
rip open plastic-wrapped sacks of jerky with their teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "We have two kinds of clients," says Gus Niepagen, owner of Gus' Fresh
Jerky. "The ones serious about the outdoors and the ones going up to
Mammoth for the weekend. They both need jerky.</TE>
<TE>   "One needs the food; the other needs something to shut the kids up,"
he says. "With each bag I guarantee at least 10 minutes of total silence
from the back seat.'</TE>
<TE>   As wine and cheese define Napa or Sonoma, jerky evokes the expansive,
mostly undeveloped Owens Valley with its enduring pioneer flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the valley is hardly the only locale where jerky is
popular. Hunters, hikers, bikers and horsemen also gobble up prolific
amounts of the stuff from New England to the bayous of Louisiana to the
Great Plains to the northern Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   But talk to enough outdoors people in California, and they'll tell you
there is no other place in the state where the chewy strips are so
eagerly sought and even revered. On weekends, thousands of pounds of the
stuff move off store shelves all over the valley, where some roadside
shops even cure their own.</TE>
<TE>'Back-Country, Horse-Packer, Cowboy Thing'</TE>
<TE>   Jerky is not just another snack in the Owens Valley. It's fast food in
a region that the big chains haven't colonized.</TE>
<TE>   "We get calls and e-mails all the time" from people who want to know
where to get jerky, says Susanna Ruland of the Bishop Chamber of
Commerce. "I think it's a back-country, horse-packer and cowboy thing,
but I guess people also get on beef jerky when they're trying to get off
the chew."</TE>
<TE>   This region is known for the many westerns filmed here and renowned as
a gateway for horse trips into the High Sierra. Jerky is saddlebag food.
It can be stomped on by a horse, run over by a jeep, or buried in a
backpack for weeks without losing any of its savor.</TE>
<TE>   Danica Berner, who has lived in the Owens Valley for 31 years, co-owns
Sequoia Kings Pack Train, which takes visitors into the recesses of
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, high above the town of
Independence.</TE>
<TE>   One of jerky's obvious benefits, she says, is that, unlike bread or
candy bars, it doesn't "squish up" when stuffed into the bottom of a
backpack or saddlebag.</TE>
<TE>   She also sees jerky as a food that links the land to the people and
the people to their ancestors. It's fare that people can chew while
sitting on a rock in the high country and contemplating some of the
nation's most dramatic alpine vistas.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to connect with the culture up here and the communities
when they visit," she says. "They don't want to go to the huge
supermarkets like Vons. Maybe they want to stop and get jerky in Bishop
because their families have been stopping in Bishop for generations
getting jerky."</TE>
<TE>   The recipe comes from the Indians, who often took jerky on their
travels.</TE>
<TE>   "The version of beef jerky that most Americans know is really
profoundly native," says Rayna Green of the Smithsonian Institution.
"Most folks learned the medium of what they call beef jerky in the latter
part of the 18th and early 19th centuries, mostly from Indians in the
Midwest and the West.'</TE>
<TE>   On the frontier, jerky was often an afterthought, made of leftover
beef still worth too much to throw to the dogs. In the New West--where
the Old West is cleaned up, repackaged and sold to tourists--jerky is not
made from leftovers. It is crafted from choice cuts, prepared by
marinating meat in a variety of spices and then thoroughly drying it.</TE>
<TE>   Aficionados have dried virtually every kind of meat they can get their
hands on--including ostrich, alligator, wild boar and bison. A category
of food called meat snacks, which includes jerky, quietly crept past
potato chips and cookies in the mid-1990s to become America's
fastest-growing type of snack, according to the Snack Food Assn., a
national group based in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more interesting explanations for this comes from Susan
Bowerman of UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition. She says more Americans
than ever are eating at gas stations, many of which have convenience
stores. (Bowerman also points to the very real difference between jerky
and the seemingly ubiquitous Slim Jim meat stick, which is high in
saturated fat and lists "mechanically separated chicken" as an
ingredient.)</TE>
<TE>   Back in the Owens Valley, the undisputed jerky champ is Mahogany
Smoked Meats in Bishop, where a pound of the stuff can cost $36.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1922, the store is a throwback to another era. Several
fine bucks are mounted on the wall, and the place hums with the activity
of employees drying jerky and smoking meats. On a typical weekend, more
than 1,000 pounds of jerky are sold.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the store is a simple 25-foot counter that is nothing
less than a shrine to meat: bacon, ham, pork chops, sausage and a wide
variety of jerky.</TE>
<TE>   There is no mention anywhere of "trans-fatty acids" or
"polyunsaturated fat." The store often smells like smoked bacon, also a
big seller. Some customers are so overcome by the plumpness and vigor of
the jerkies and other meats that they are momentarily tongue-tied, unable
to formulate a coherent order.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Mojarro runs the store for his mother, who is the owner. He
holds a master's degree in business administration and has pushed to
expand sales over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Mojarro moved back to Bishop, Gus Niepagen opened his
jerky stand at the southern end of the Owens Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Mojarro put up a sign just south of Gus' store, showing a
cartoon pig figure holding a bloated belly. On the ground around it, beer
cans and a cigarette pack are pictured. Flies buzz around the pig's head.
The caption reads: "Pig Out! The Only Jerky Worth Stopping For. Mahogany
Smoked Meats."</TE>
<TE>   Niepagen thinks the competition is good, because it creates an even
bigger market for jerky. A native of Argentina, he used to own a produce
store in Lancaster, but decided to try the jerky trade after an "old
Mormon guy" gave him a secret recipe. He makes the jerky in Riverside
County but sells it only in Olancha.</TE>
<TE>   His store is as small as the surrounding landscape is big. In this age
of prefabricated structures, it's a work in progress, a 1920s-era gas
station embellished with materials scavenged from the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, Gus is building a restaurant with a buffet. "We'll have a
western theme," he says. "We'll get some cowboys and Indians."</TE>
<TE>   As the sun dips behind the Sierra crest and a cold wind sweeps across
the sage and creosote of the valley floor, Gus waxes on about the land of
opportunity. He never dreamed his jerky stand would be so profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did he expect to get e-mails from truckers and Angelenos thanking
him for saving their lives. His jerky is so chewy, apparently, it helps
motorists stay awake on long, lonely stretches of 395.</TE>
<TE>   "I had people telling me that selling jerky here would be like drawing
water from rock," he says, gesturing at his stand, and the great
mountains behind it.</TE>
<TE>   To him, this little store represents the very best of America, where
there is still room for a fellow to stick a sign in the dirt, start his
own business and make a name for himself.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, move some serious amounts of teriyaki jerky.</TE>

<HD>Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be
targeted, Stephen Cooper says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who
helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive
Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks
ago to put the company back on the road to solvency.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and
rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.</LD>
<LD>   "Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals
that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate," said Cooper, a
principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes
in corporate restructuring. "I think you will see something sooner as
opposed to later."</LD>
<TE>   The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality
play, and all are potential defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2,
following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions
with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's
seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it
disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out
billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that
abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1
billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions
of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including
former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K.
Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report
concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor,
and Vinson &amp; Elkins, one of its outside law firms.</TE>
<TE>Still Sorting Out All the Issues</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of
Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has
not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they
earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive
Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper and his team are still "sorting out issues" related to Enron's
financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts
that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading
operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value
of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that
anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board,"
Cooper said. "We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a
regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main,
will be accurate." Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace
Andersen, which it fired.</TE>
<TE>   Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc.
alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with
Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company.
Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented
the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit
rating.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the
market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name
will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and
power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial
demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being
called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete
with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled,
deadbolted office.</TE>
<TE>   To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response
to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An
all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's overhaul is well underway.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest
pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the
$1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger.
Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New
York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would
supply Enron with a cut of any future profit.</TE>
<TE>   What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines,
including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity
generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining
telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon
utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other
assets whose poor performance helped sink the company.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading
because "we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be
substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business,
it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow-
and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes
business," Cooper said. "So in my view, there is an eminently
reorganizable entity here."</TE>
<TE>'Not Going to Wallow and Linger'</TE>
<TE>   Cooper expects to present "a fairly on-point direction" for
reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to
have settled on a new version of the company within a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not
going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have
to."</TE>
<TE>   Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from
bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is "not
of that mind," adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing
companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more
sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases
all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters,
Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40
million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem
on Enron, but he did acknowledge the "very labor-intensive" process of
sorting through "hundreds upon hundreds" of so-called special purpose
entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to
finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other
legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the
extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each
vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually
large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not
versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being
looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that
gets sorted out," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Special purpose entities "are not good or bad, they're just
instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial
flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their
balance sheet to fit the needs of their business," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from
Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension
of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get
into a position where they had divided loyalties" by working for both
Enron and the partnerships, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly,
they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both
sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length
transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a
prenuptial agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he
has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores
Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills.</TE>
<TE>   Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and
stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of
people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod
to coalesce all of these other national interests" involving such issues
as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as
an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic
constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start
for our employees," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle
of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires.
You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's
still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep
going."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>As investors burned by the Enron scandal punish companies with even
a whiff of accounting irregularity or other questionable behavior, some
firms have found a new strategy: an old-fashioned, forthright balance
sheet and income statement.</LD>
<LD>   Espousing a cleaner-than-thou philosophy, corporations are turning
away from finance practices that not only are legal but in other times
might have won them praise for creativity.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the message these companies want to convey is "We're not
Enron." Some are swearing off complex ways of reporting sales and profit
that strike critics as misleading or simply difficult to understand. Some
are working to bolster the independence of their boards, mindful of the
tarring Enron directors have taken for apparent conflicts of interest.</LD>
<TE>   The Enron debacle has given the American public a quick lesson in
complex accounting, introducing such arcane terminology as synthetic
leases, special purpose entities, derivatives and pro forma.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are taking a microscope to accounting methods that seldom
raised questions before the Enron scandal. IBM, Qwest Communications and
Marriott International last week joined a list of companies whose shares
have been rocked by accounting concerns, among other factors.</TE>
<TE>   If companies are being punished for tangled financials, perhaps the
flip side is that others will be rewarded for clarity. "Because of Enron,
a premium will be attached to companies with sterling governance
structures and financials that are very, very plain vanilla," said
Charles Elson, who heads the University of Delaware's Center for
Corporate Governance.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the housecleaning is meant to reassure worried stockholders
and buff firms' public image, but there is a more pressing concern: The
Securities and Exchange Commission, itself criticized for missing Enron's
problems, has put corporate America on notice that within the year, it
will more closely examine the books of the Fortune 500, the nation's
largest companies.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also has warned that adherence to the letter of accounting
rules may no longer be enough; companies that produce misleading
financial statements, even if they technically comply with regulations,
could be punished.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms are making changes on their own initiative, others only
after the posse has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts last week decided to scrap a synthetic lease it
was using to finance a new factory. It didn't act, however, until it had
been zinged by Forbes magazine for the arcane debt instrument and then
slammed by a headline in the tabloid New York Post: "Krispy Kreme Bites."</TE>
<TE>   "While this type of lease is both common and complies with the most
rigorous accounting standards, the company . . . will instead use
conventional, on-balance-sheet financing," Scott Livengood, Krispy
Kreme's chairman and chief executive, said. "There is no reason for us to
do anything that could be misinterpreted, regardless of how legal and
acceptable it may be."</TE>
<TE>   Although firms are anxious to calm investor fears, you aren't likely
to see TV commercials touting clean balance sheets or conservative
revenue recognition, communications experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "An ad campaign is far too blatant," said Jerry Swerling, who runs the
public relations program at USC's Annenberg School for Communication.
"Besides, it's not the kind of thing you'd advertise."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, companies are using their own investor relations staffs or
hiring outside public relations agencies for help in delivering the
we're-not-Enron message, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key questions raised by Enron's implosion has been, where
was the board of directors? Although board members contend that key
information was withheld from them, critics also have noted that seven of
Enron's 14 directors either did business with the company, worked as paid
consultants to it or were affiliated with organizations that received
large donations from Enron or its top officers.</TE>
<TE>   With board independence in the spotlight, Interpublic Group, the
world's largest advertising firm, this week announced that four of its
executives would step down from the board and an unaffiliated member
would be added. This leaves the board with two Interpublic executives and
seven outsiders, whereas the old split had been six and six.</TE>
<TE>   "The interests of Interpublic shareholders will be best served by a
board that is primarily made up of independent, outside directors,"
Chairman John Dooner said in a statement that did not mention Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Procter &amp; Gamble recently went out of its way to tell Wall Street
analysts that it has "no material off-balance-sheet financing." A year
ago, such a comment might have drawn blank stares, but today anyone can
see it's a direct reference to a finance and accounting practice that was
at the heart of the Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Enron used limited partnerships, some headed by former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew S. Fastow, to artificially boost profit and keep large
amounts of debt off its corporate balance sheet. Enron's slide toward
bankruptcy became steeper Nov. 8 when it acknowledged that these
arrangements were improper and reduced its previously reported profit by
$586 million.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Silverman, chief executive of the hotel and real estate firm
Cendant, which has had serious accounting problems in the past,
complained in a recent television interview that the harsh new scrutiny
amounts to "the McCarthyism of guilt by association."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Cendant bowed to the pressure and said that in the
future it would reduce the number of special "one-time" charges it takes
against earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Financial watchdogs, including former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, have
criticized firms for excessive use of such "extraordinary" charges. Many
companies routinely offer separate versions of their income statements
each quarter and encourage analysts to focus on the one with the better
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to disclose charges as required by generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP, in one statement, but then to whisk away
the charges in a rosier pro forma statement, which is a hypothetical
description of a company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   If firms can persuade Wall Street that the pro forma statement gives a
truer picture of their financial status, there is an incentive for them
to label all kinds of expenses extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Enron, however, that practice may be on the wane. Several firms,
including computer chip maker Xilinx and electronics manufacturer
Solectron, recently decided to stop issuing pro formas entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Chellam, Xilinx chief financial officer, acknowledged in an
interview last week that because of the Enron blowup, "everybody gets
cast in a bad light" for practices that once were widely accepted.</TE>
<TE>   The only major effect the change will have on Xilinx relates to its
acquisition in 2000 of a company whose main asset was a group of talented
engineers. The engineers signed contracts agreeing not to compete against
Xilinx for a specified period of time should they leave the company.</TE>
<TE>   According to GAAP, Xilinx must take regular deductions from income to
reflect the declining value of those non-compete agreements as time runs
out on them. Now it will no longer produce a separate pro forma statement
excluding the deductions.</TE>
<TE>   "The change in reporting will cost four or five pennies in [earnings
per share]," Chellam said, "but that's immaterial compared to the
benefit." He said he expects firms to be rewarded in the stock market for
greater simplicity in their financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, if the people don't understand your business and don't
like what's going on, you'll suffer," Chellam said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, however, shouldn't fool themselves into thinking that more
rigorous accounting methods will magically iron out the rough spots in
the stock market, said Robert Olstein, a Purchase, N.Y., money manager
who revels in accounting nuts and bolts.</TE>
<TE>   "Every company in my portfolio does something that we have to adjust
for," Olstein said. "The notion that GAAP produces economic reality is a
fantasy."</TE>

<HD>Karzai Seeks to Quell Fears</HD>
<DH>Asia: The Afghan leader dismisses official's slaying as a vendetta
and denies that a rogue faction threatens his government. More
peacekeepers may be needed, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>With his top security officials charged with murdering a Cabinet
minister and his capital's international peacekeeping force under fire,
interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai promised Sunday to take "every
measure to guarantee security in this battered nation."</LD>
<LD>   Addressing the international media after three of his most stressful
days since he took office Dec. 22, Karzai dismissed the killing of his
aviation minister Thursday as a personal vendetta with no political
overtones. And responding to reports of gunshots fired at British
peacekeepers Saturday and a wild melee Friday involving peacekeepers and
soccer fans, he said he might request a bigger and more robust
peacekeeping force.</LD>
<LD>   The assassination of Air Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul
Rahman at the Kabul airport fanned fears of a return to the brutal and
corrupt Afghan governments of the early 1990s. Saying five suspects had
been arrested here and two more in Saudi Arabia, Karzai sought to tamp
down concerns that a rogue faction of Northern Alliance officials
threatened his government.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no way we will let Afghanistan go back to the ways of the
past," Karzai said. "These gun-runners, these guys who think they can get
away with looting and murder--those days are over."</TE>
<TE>   But Karzai offered few new details about how four senior security
officials and the airport's two security chiefs were able--at least in
the version of events he offered--to kill Rahman and toss his body from
an airplane. Three of the suspects then boarded a chartered plane
carrying Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The pilgrims were
initially accused of beating Rahman to death because of flight delays.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Karzai offer details of the purported personal motive for the
killing, or why six top officials with a grudge would risk stabbing a
government minister to death aboard a plane at an international airport
while more than 1,000 people milled about on the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Abdullah added to the mystery by telling reporters at
the presidential palace that three of the killers had demanded that
Rahman sign a letter of resignation. That led to renewed speculation that
the killing involved the lucrative smuggling trade and the opportunities
for graft that traditionally have been controlled by aviation ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said he learned of Rahman's death when the interior and defense
ministers told him that their own security officials were involved. He
said he then convened an emergency session of the Cabinet, which decided
to have the officials arrested regardless of their senior status.</TE>
<TE>   "They acted like Cabinet members of Afghanistan, not party members--a
very patriotic decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>Cabinet Is 'United in Straight Afghan Way'</TE>
<TE>   Denying persistent reports of factional battles within the Cabinet and
government, Karzai added, "The Cabinet is very much united in the
straight Afghan way."</TE>
<TE>   He also chastised reporters for focusing on the killing, saying in
exasperation, "Look, there were no political motives."</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested will be "dealt with very strongly," he said. "There
will not be any lenient hand there. . . . They have committed a murder.
Let the courts decide."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what sort of trial the accused can expect in a nation whose
justice system is in shambles, Karzai said Afghanistan still functions
under a 1964 constitution that provides for criminal trials.</TE>
<TE>   In random interviews in Kabul, ordinary Afghans expressed concern that
Rahman's killing might revive the violence and gunplay that have plagued
the capital for years.</TE>
<TE>   "People have gotten really worried since the killing," said
Hurmatullah, 25, a banana vendor who, like many Afghans, uses only one
name. "Security is our biggest anxiety. The government is good only as
long as security is good."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Khaleq, 55, a bus driver, added: "Today this man was killed.
Tomorrow another might be killed. We feel endangered for our own lives."</TE>
<TE>   Even as he was offering assurances that Rahman's death did not mean a
deterioration of security, Karzai said he will ask for a revision of the
peacekeeping force's mandate "if the security environment does not
improve further." He said he wants the "national army"--the fractious
collection of warlord militias that toppled the Taliban with U.S.
help--to have a greater role once it is trained and mobilized.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's comments came a day after a British peacekeeping observation
post in Kabul was fired on. A spokesman for the International Security
Assistance Force said the peacekeepers returned fire. Villagers said a
man helping take his pregnant sister-in-law to a hospital was killed; the
ISAF said the incident was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>Karzai Deflects Queries on Assassination</TE>
<TE>   It was the first attack on an ISAF post since the 4,000-member,
18-nation force began operating in December.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't our mandate to intervene within the civilian section of the
airport where Rahman was killed," an ISAF spokesman said Sunday. Capt.
Graham Dunlop said that while the ISAF controls only the airport's
military areas, an ISAF fire brigade did rescue the president of the
national airline from a mob beating in the civilian zone an hour before
Rahman's death. Dunlop stressed that the ISAF was unaware of the attack
on Rahman and received no request to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Karzai abruptly halted or deflected questions
about the slaying. After announcing that police were pursuing two
suspects in Afghanistan and another in Saudi Arabia, he urged reporters
to shift their attention to his Cabinet's rebuilding efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The killing, he said, was "a peculiar case, an unexpected one, a very
sad one." When a reporter asked another question about it, the prime
minister cut him off and said, "That's over."</TE>
<TE>   Also this weekend, internecine fighting flared in Paktia province,
southeast of Kabul, as members of several tribes became involved in a
dispute over land.</TE>
<TE>   The fight, which took place Saturday about a two-hour drive from the
city of Khowst in southern Paktia, occurred when Kochi tribesmen fired on
soldiers loyal to the governor of Khowst, who is supported by local
warlord Bacha Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The Kochi are seminomadic people who move their cattle and sheep from
one area to another along the Afghan-Pakistani border to find fresh
fodder. They are known locally as smugglers of guns and hashish.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's men had gone to the Kochi to try to stop a fight the Kochi were
having with soldiers belonging to a rival tribe, according to Kameel
Khan, the warlord's younger brother and a local commander.</TE>
<TE>Commander Says Tribe Sheltered Al Qaeda</TE>
<TE>   It appeared that the two tribes were fighting over land. But Kameel
Khan said the Kochi have sheltered Al Qaeda members and that he and other
commanders loyal to his brother had urged the Americans to bomb them.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing could be heard at dusk Saturday, into the night and again
at midday Sunday. It was unclear how the local commanders could be sure
Al Qaeda members were taking shelter with the Kochi, but one said his men
were relying on local intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   According to wire reports citing telephone conversations with
residents of the area, the bombing was not on the Kochi people but hit a
former Al Qaeda training camp near the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   One resident said that the camp was believed to be deserted and that
he did not know of any casualties. The area is about nine miles from the
village of Zawar, where U.S. Special Forces troops have been seeking Al
Qaeda and Taliban renegades.</TE>
<TE>   Since the sites could not be visited because of ongoing military
activity, it was not possible to confirm what the targets were.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing was apparently the first since U.S. jets attacked an Al
Qaeda camp in Zawar on Jan. 14.</TE>

<HD>Horror at Ga. Crematory Isn't Over</HD>

<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>The urns rested in places of honor--on the mantel, in the
bookshelf. Or they were buried under tombstones kept fresh with flowers
year round.</LD>
<LD>   Husbands, wives, daughters, grandsons treated the urns with reverence.</LD>
<LD>   Now they find, the urns were full of burned wood chips. And the loved
ones whose ashes were supposed to be inside were instead decomposing
unnoticed in the woods, their bodies tossed onto piles of mummified
corpses or scattered among hundreds of anonymous bones.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I was talking to my momma's ashes," Barbara Davis said.
"But she wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, furious and grieving anew, brought some of those ashes to the
Walker County Civic Center on Sunday, joining hundreds of distraught
relatives seeking answers as a macabre investigation unfolded on the
grounds of Tri-State Crematory.</TE>
<TE>   As a chill dusk settled over this mountain community in northwest
Georgia, authorities said they had recovered 118 decomposing corpses,
including an infant's, from the crematory. Some were in shrouds, others
in caskets. One body was in the back of a van. Some were in hospital
gowns, with toe tags still attached. Others were laid out in funeral
suits. By evening, 16 had been identified.</TE>
<TE>Forest Believed to Be Site of Many Bodies</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect to discover scores more bodies over the next days and
weeks as they comb the pine forest covering the crematory grounds and
send divers into a small lake on the property.</TE>
<TE>   "We could find as many as 300 sets of remains before this
investigation is over," said Buzz Weiss of the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency. "It looks like something out of a Stephen King novel.
Nobody has ever seen anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   The crematory served as many as 30 funeral homes in Georgia, Alabama
and Tennessee, and the state medical examiner said some bodies looked as
though they could be two decades old.</TE>
<TE>   The operator of the crematory, Brent Marsh, was released on bond
Sunday, to the outrage of many here.</TE>
<TE>   He has been charged with five counts of theft by deception for
allegedly taking money for cremations he never performed. Authorities
expect many more charges will come as the case unfolds. They said Marsh
has been cooperating, turning over all his records, though one official
described the crematory's ledgers as incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Marsh nor his parents, who have owned the crematory for
decades, could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   So far, officials said, the only explanation the Marshes have been
able to offer is that the crematory furnace has been broken for some
time.</TE>
<TE>   "And that certainly does not excuse what we have here," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives agreed.</TE>
<TE>   They came to the Walker County Civic Center bearing ceramic urns and
haunted memories. They scribbled lists of their loved ones'
distinguishing features, noting a mother's birthmark, a husband's scars.
They spoke with Red Cross counselors and pounded Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes
with questions. He could do little but express his horror.</TE>
<TE>   "I started as a prosecutor 30 years ago, and I thought I had seen
everything," the governor said as he left a private meeting with 150
family members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just terrible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those whose relatives had been identified made plans, again, for
cremation. Those who could only wonder agonized: Should they dig up the
urn in the cemetery? Should they hold a second funeral?</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know what to think," said Tim Mason, a local accountant.</TE>
<TE>   His father's corpse was the first to be identified at the crematory.
But Mason feels sure that his mother, who passed away in 1995, was tossed
in the woods to decompose as well. For the last six years, he has visited
her grave, set flowers on her tombstone. He has taken comfort in seeing
his parents resting side by side in death.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he wonders if they will ever find his mother's remains.</TE>
<TE>   He wonders what indignities her corpse has suffered.</TE>
<TE>   He can barely process the shock.</TE>
<TE>   "There's hurt. Anger. You're sad. The whole range of emotions.
Disbelief," Mason said. "There is no way to describe it."</TE>
<TE>Crematory Owners Were Well-Respected</TE>
<TE>   Like others in the community, Mason said he felt doubly betrayed
because he considered the Marsh family his friends. Ray and Clara Marsh,
the crematory owners, were well-respected as civic leaders, admired as
active volunteers. Brent Marsh, who took over day-to-day management in
1996, was the treasurer of his church.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Marshes and their son lived near the crematory, which is in
a residential neighborhood. Authorities had conflicting reports about
whether neighbors ever complained of a stench from the property.</TE>
<TE>   Because the crematory served only funeral homes and did not deal with
the public directly, it was not subject to review or licensing by state
inspectors, a loophole that legislators are already moving to address.
Sheriff's deputies first entered the property Friday, after a woman
walking her dog nearby reported finding a human skull.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, some families now remember suspicious signs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, for instance, gave the funeral home three small urns for her
mother's ashes, but was told she needed to bring still another because
the ashes would not fit. When they received the urns, relatives noticed
right away that they rattled.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like gravel, like a bunch of rocks," recalled Reginald
Banks, grandson of the deceased. "Ashes shouldn't make that noise."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis did not raise questions. She had never had a relative
cremated before, so she did not know what to expect. She set an urn on
her living room mantel and lit candles in front of it every Sunday
without fail. She talked to what she thought were her mother's remains.</TE>
<TE>   "We would tell her how we missed her, how we hoped she was resting in
peace," Davis said. "Now, we come to find out she wasn't."</TE>

<HD>Visit Stirring Up Anti-Americanism</HD>
<DH>Asia: Though rallies in South Korea remain small, the anger is
spreading over Bush's 'axis of evil' remark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>A large banner depicting President Bush with snakes in his hair and
missiles protruding from his mouth and ears hung behind the lectern, a
fitting backdrop for a fierce anti-American diatribe.</LD>
<LD>   "North Korea, Iran, Iraq. An 'axis of evil'? The core of evil is the
United States of America," South Korean political activist Paik Ki Wan
thundered to a standing-room-only crowd in downtown Seoul on Friday
night. "This Bush is a liar, and in Korean custom we do not welcome liars
in our homes. We should all rush to the airport and stop him from getting
off the plane."</LD>
<LD>   Despite efforts by South Korea's government to keep a lid on
anti-American demonstrations, there is a strong undercurrent of
resentment toward Bush's first visit here, which begins Tuesday. In
anticipation of his arrival, students, religious groups and labor
associations have held protests for the last several days.</LD>
<TE>   Today, about 30 university students occupied the Seoul office of the
American Chamber of Commerce, saying they wanted to distribute a
statement opposing Bush's visit, Korean news reports said. The protesters
said they would not leave until Bush apologized for his remarks on North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Employees fled the building and apparently were not injured, according
to the reports. Police were attempting to remove the students.</TE>
<TE>   Although most demonstrations have drawn 1,000 people or fewer,
anti-American sentiments are being expressed by the decidedly mainstream.
The popular afternoon newspaper Munhwa Ilbo ran a cartoon Saturday of the
Statue of Liberty holding warplanes instead of a torch, while the
moderate Korea Times opined that the U.S. anti-terror campaign appeared
to be going in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism is surprising given that South Korea is considered among
the most steadfast of U.S. allies. The two nations' ties were solidified
when the U.S. intervened in the 1950-53 Korean War to repel an invasion
by communist North Korea, backed by China. But increasingly, young South
Koreans are asking whether, 50 years later, the United States has not
become an obstacle to reconciliation with the North.</TE>
<TE>   "Koreans do appreciate what the United States did for us. But now time
has passed, and people are starting to think the United States is serving
its own interests and not ours," said Shim Joon Hee, a 25-year-old
business student who rallied Saturday with about 1,000 others in Seoul's
Jongmyo Park.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent source of controversy was Bush's declaration in his
Jan. 29 State of the Union address that North Korea is part of an "axis
of evil," along with Iran and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's hard line on North Korea runs counter to the
"sunshine policy" of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, who won a Nobel
Peace Prize in 2000 for his efforts to open a dialogue with the North.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reassurances from the White House to the contrary, many South
Koreans interpreted Bush's speech to mean that the U.S. planned to go to
war against North Korea. In an interview on South Korean TV over the
weekend, Bush tried to reduce the tension, but the damage had been done.
A survey by the ruling party found that South Koreans believed, by a
margin of 3 to 2, that Bush's characterization of North Korea was
inappropriate. Asked who was responsible for deteriorating relations
between North Korea and the U.S., 38% blamed Washington, while 31% said
Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big stream of anti-Americanism on campus, and with Bush's
'axis of evil' remark, it has reached the boiling point," said Shim, the
business student.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that sentiment is directed at the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed
in South Korea. Plans to build additional housing for the troops at the
Yongsan military base in Seoul have roused opposition from civic groups
that complain that the U.S. military presence in the heart of the capital
is an affront to national sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Another case that has piqued anger involves an American civilian
employee of the base who was indicted in April by a Korean court on
charges of dumping a large quantity of formaldehyde down a sewer drain
that flows into a river. The U.S. military has refused to turn over the
employee, arguing that the Korean court lacks jurisdiction. The case has
prompted regular protests outside the Yongsan base.</TE>
<TE>   Student demonstrations in Seoul over the last few days have focused on
reports that Bush is pressuring South Korea to buy U.S.-made F-15 fighter
jets for its air force.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the United States that has been promoting wars in order to
serve their own interest in selling weapons," said protester Yoon Young
Hee, 20, who was at the park.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the U.S. role in the Korean War is sacred. A BBC documentary
titled "Kill 'Em All," about an alleged massacre of refugees by U.S.
troops in 1950, prompted calls this month for further investigations into
the wartime record.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's government appears chagrined by the overt
anti-Americanism. Nearly two dozen riot police surrounded a nun who tried
to approach the U.S. Embassy on Friday wearing a sandwich board scrawled
with anti-Bush slogans. Police have used shields to surround protesters
who have tried to burn U.S. flags, as though to prevent such scenes from
being photographed.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, however, a student managed to scale a 30-foot statue and
burn four U.S. flags before he was plucked down by police using a
firetruck ladder.</TE>
<TE>   The outpourings have become so pronounced that Kim recently made a
public call for restraint. "Anti-Americanism does not serve the national
interest," the president said. "Mistakes at the level of national
politics can be corrected, but diplomatic errors are difficult to set
right."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, South Korea is deeply polarized over the best way to deal
with North Korea, and many people, especially the older generation,
respect Bush for speaking out harshly against Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the sunshine policy that has prevented war with North
Korea. It is the deterrent power of the U.S. Army that has been here for
50 years. We mature people know that. The younger people who weren't born
during the Korean War can't understand," said Choi Woon Sang, 76, a
retired diplomat who is co-president of a group supporting Bush's visit.
"Bush was right. He pointed out the real character of North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Yongsan base, a pro-U.S. group made up mostly of Korean
War veterans has been holding regular demonstrations in an attempt to
compete with the opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Choi Jae Dong, 21, one of the few students to march with the veterans,
said anti-Americanism was rampant at Hanyang University, where he studies
political science.</TE>
<TE>   "They think that the U.S. should withdraw its military from Korea
because it is a hindrance to reunification. I am always getting into
arguments with them," Choi said. He also said many of his classmates
believe that the U.S. brought the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on itself.
"They say the U.S. deserved it because of their imperialist international
politics."</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that support in South Korea for the U.S. anti-terror
campaign is among the weakest of the major American allies. A Gallup
International Assn. study of polls around the world found that 54% of
South Koreans opposed military retaliation and 38% favored it.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden, whom the U.S. accuses of planning the Sept. 11
attacks, has even gained a bit of respect among youths here. In December,
a small scandal broke out when it was discovered that schoolchildren had
adapted the lyrics of a popular pop song to praise Bin Laden as "the
person I most admire." According to South Korean news reports, the lyrics
were distributed on an anti-American Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   Taxi driver Han Chan Hee, 35, is not the exception in believing that
the U.S.--and Bush in particular--should bear some blame for Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "America invited it, being so harsh," Han said. "The United States
might be the strongest country in the world, but it has lost friends."</TE>
<TE>   But in the next breath, he complained about the students demonstrating
against the U.S.--and the traffic disruptions they were causing.</TE>

<HD>Bush 'Confident' Koizumi Can Lead Japan to Recovery</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President, on first stop of his Asia tour, says the
premier can revive the economy. He also defends his 'axis of evil'
remarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>President Bush today expressed his strong confidence in Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's ability to revive this nation's
sagging economy, calling Koizumi "a strong leader" with "a bold agenda."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm confident in this man's leadership abilities," Bush said at a
news conference in Tokyo, his first stop on a six-day Asia tour.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm confident in his strategy. And I'm confident in his desire to
implement that strategy. And when he implements that strategy, it will
help Japan's economy a lot," he said, with the beleaguered Japanese
leader at his side.</LD>
<TE>   On the continuing controversy over his characterization of Iraq, Iran
and North Korea as "an axis of evil," Bush dismissed criticism of his
remarks in some world capitals.</TE>
<TE>   The president also told reporters that, should there be a need to
expand the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, which Bush has said is
all but certain, he is "confident that nations will come with us."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the leaders he has consulted with "fully understand exactly
what needs to happen. They understand the resolve of the United States of
America."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi pleaded for patience with his agenda to revitalize Japan's
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving steadily," Koizumi said. "It's been less than one year."</TE>
<TE>   Before Bush launched the week of intense Asian diplomacy, his top
foreign policy advisors on Sunday defended his recent remarks suggesting
that the United States may expand the war on terrorism by targeting Iraq,
Iran or North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In separate television interviews, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that the
president's remarks had caused consternation among some allies.</TE>
<TE>   But they indicated that Bush had no intention of backing away from his
bellicose rhetoric--or the possibility of taking military action beyond
Afghanistan, especially against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "What the president has said is, 'I'm calling it the way it is.' He
did it in a very straightforward, direct, realistic way that tends to,
you know, jangle people's nerves," Powell said on CNN's "Late Edition."</TE>
<TE>   "But once they settle down and understand that he is going to go about
this in a prudent, disciplined, determined way, they realize that's what
leadership is about, and they begin to understand why it might make sense
for them to join in whatever efforts we may be getting ready to
undertake," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Rice decried the "instant analysis" of the president's remarks--first
made Jan. 29 in his State of the Union address--as "not a good thing."
She likened Bush's words to the "evil empire" remark made by President
Reagan, a phrase that Rice said "spoke to many people in the Soviet Union
who knew that about that country and many dissidents who were looking for
someone to finally speak the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The comments by Powell and Rice made clear that the "axis of evil"
remark is likely to overshadow Bush's weeklong trip to Tokyo, Seoul and
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Asian reporters over the weekend in which he
previewed his trip, Bush defended his decision to pull out of the Kyoto
treaty on global warming but said he had no objections to other nations
ratifying the pact to curb emission of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's bad for our country," Bush said of the treaty, adding
that he "did the world a favor" by being forthright about his opposition
to it and then acting on his convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that although he was "committed to good
environmental standards . . . I will do so in a way that doesn't cost
people jobs. The security of the American people is my most important
job."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to allay concerns among South Koreans, Bush stressed to the
Asian journalists that he strongly backed South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung's "sunshine policy" of promoting dialogue with the North.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments linking North Korea with Iraq and Iran have upset many
South Koreans who believe that the remarks could undermine Kim's policy.
But Bush noted that he too had made overtures to Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, our offer still stands for dialogue," the president said,
referring to North Korea. "We had no conditions on dialogue with North
Korea. But it hadn't been taken up yet. We said, 'We'll discuss things
with you.' And that's still on the table."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said North Korea could demonstrate its good intentions by pulling
back its arms directed at the South. He added that if Pyongyang abandoned
its "proliferation of weapons of mass destruction" and did so in a
transparent way, "we would welcome trade" with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   As for his stop in Beijing, Bush said he intended to discuss religious
freedom with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in Tokyo during a light drizzle Sunday afternoon, Bush
went to the U.S. Embassy, where he spoke to about 400 members of the
diplomatic community, including some Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Before meeting with Koizumi today, the president and First Lady Laura
Bush visited the Meiji Jingu Shrine, dedicated to the Meiji emperor, who
led Japan into the modern era. There, they watched a demonstration of
yabusame, or mounted archery. When they met in Shanghai in October,
Koizumi gave Bush a yabusame bow and arrow as a symbol of Japan's resolve
to help the U.S. strike a blow against terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Kosovo Tunes In to Milosevic Genocide Trial</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Ethnic Albanians say the sight brings satisfaction as well
as sorrow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SRBICA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Here in the heart of Kosovo's Drenica region, where separatist
guerrillas first took up the fight against former Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, tough men gathered around coffee shop televisions
last week to watch in grim triumph as their defeated enemy went on trial.</LD>
<LD>   When Milosevic, at the end of the second day, angrily assailed the war
crimes tribunal in The Hague as illegitimate, one of the men watching
ridiculed the onetime strongman by shouting a warning to the
international judges and prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   "Milosevic will put all of you in prison tomorrow!" Pajazit Haliti,
45, a former fighter in the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, called out
mockingly toward the TV set, prompting ripples of laughter from other
tables.</LD>
<TE>   "We never even dreamed of this," Haliti later told a reporter.
"Neither did he."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic stands accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, in
part for his forces' conduct in Kosovo three years ago. Thousands were
slain and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes in the province
before NATO forces stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a touch of swagger in the reaction of some ethnic
Albanian men watching Milosevic's trial, there was only aching sorrow in
the village of Morin, where inhabitants say 45 people were killed by
Serbian forces during the early days of the 1999 bombing campaign by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we feel satisfaction to see him in court," said Rifete
Mziu, 37, the widowed mother of four small children, taking a break from
turning the soil of her fields with a shovel. But what Mziu really wants
is to be able to bury the body of her missing husband, an elementary
school teacher who never had any interest in being a fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Imprisonment means that Milosevic will pay for what he did, Mziu said.</TE>
<TE>   "But first of all, he should be asked to reveal where the missing
people are," she added, fighting back tears. "I want my husband's body. .
. . The children keep saying: 'Daddy's not dead. Milosevic just took him
to prison. Maybe he'll let him go.' I don't want to raise my children
with the false hope that he's still alive somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Mziu's neighbor, Mehreme Hoti, 70, said many in her family watched the
live broadcast of the trial's opening day, which included videotape of
atrocities shown by the prosecution. Milosevic is charged in connection
with crimes committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</TE>
<TE>   "We all cried," Hoti said. "The kids, us women, everybody cried while
we watched it." The trial may help the world understand the truth, but
punishing or even killing Milosevic "won't bring back the dead," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo believe that Milosevic bears command
responsibility for massacres here--a key point that the prosecution will
have to prove. Milosevic didn't directly kill people in Morin, "but the
people who killed, killed on his orders," Hoti said.</TE>
<TE>   The most widespread complaint voiced by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is
that there should be many co-defendants, from politicians and generals to
low-level soldiers and police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to have just one Milosevic" on trial, said Mehmet
Ismajli, 53. "We had 100,000 Milosevics here who committed crimes and
massacres."</TE>
<TE>   Such comments in one sense echo Milosevic's own defense, in which he
stressed that he did not and could not act alone, arguing that the
indictment against him was an indictment of the governments in Yugoslavia
and Serbia, as well as the Serbian people. Though Milosevic uses this
argument to proclaim his innocence, many ethnic Albanians use it to place
guilt on large numbers of Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90% of the population of
Kosovo, generally reject the core of Milosevic's defense concerning the
Kosovo charges: that he was fighting terrorism in his own country.</TE>
<TE>   According to Yugoslav and Serbian law, Kosovo was and is a province of
Serbia, despite being under U.N. administration since Milosevic's forces
withdrew in 1999. Kosovo is recognized as part of Yugoslavia by the
United Nations, and most Western capitals oppose its independence.</TE>
<TE>   But ethnic Albanians often assert flatly that Kosovo is not and never
was a part of Serbia. Similarly, people here say that guerrillas who
killed police and soldiers in the early days of warfare were freedom
fighters resisting oppression.</TE>
<TE>   "The KLA never fought just to have a fight," said Sadije Hoti, 40, the
daughter-in-law of Mehreme. "When the knife came to our throats, they
decided to do something about it, and they saved a lot of lives, because
at least we had some protection."</TE>
<TE>   A key founder of the KLA, Adem Jashari, was killed along with 19
members of his family in a March 1998 Serb assault on their family
compound in the village of Prekaz. Also killed in three days of fighting
were 36 neighbors and distant relatives. As the Milosevic trial unfolded
on television, his nephew, Murat Jashari, 29, said in an interview that
the family had decided to die fighting rather than yield to oppression by
running away.</TE>
<TE>   In the years before that battle, "we tried to give notice to the Serb
regime that these are still our lands, and you can kill us, but you can
never make us flee," said Jashari, who was in Germany at the time. "The
big truth is that even the smallest child in my family was
psychologically ready that it was better to die at home than to die in
the street or in another country."</TE>
<TE>   Jashari stressed that whatever the law might have said, "this was not
part of Serbia."</TE>
<TE>   "We have a different language, different culture, different
tradition," he said. "Milosevic had no reason at all to defend his
country here, because it was not part of his country."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they fought Milosevic's forces or simply fled them, ethnic
Albanian men--even those who lost many relatives--generally say that the
sacrifices were worth it. Women--especially the widows--often seem not so
sure.</TE>
<TE>   Haliti, the man talking back at the television in the coffee shop,
said he had lost a nephew, a noncombatant who was killed on the street by
a Serb sniper in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom is much more valuable than all the lives lost," Haliti said.
"At least the people who survived will live free."</TE>

<HD>Sharon Criticized Over Impasse</HD>
<DH>Israel: Political foes and even some allies question his lack of a
solution to the Palestinian crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, back at work after recovering
from a weeklong flu, faced a barrage of criticism Sunday for failing to
find a military or diplomatic solution to 17 months of fighting with the
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   As Israelis buried three soldiers and two teenagers killed since
Friday and Palestinians tried to carry out a second suicide bombing in
less than 24 hours, pundits, politicians and folks on the street angrily
demanded a new policy from Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   "Where is Sharon?" asked Tommy Lapid, leader of the opposition Shinui
Party in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. "I demand that Sharon speak to
us. . . . Mr. Sharon, I know that you won't come up with a solution, so
admit that you don't have a solution, but speak to the Israeli public."</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Sharon held a lengthy discussion with his security Cabinet,
offering no comment when he emerged. Shortly after the meeting, police
killed two Palestinians who they said were en route to carrying out a
suicide attack in the coastal town of Hadera.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout unfolded on a highway crowded with evening rush-hour
commuters, after police pulled over a white sedan near a northern Israeli
army base because the numbers on its front and back license plates did
not match.</TE>
<TE>   One of the two men inside threw a pipe bomb at the officers and opened
fire on them, a police spokesman said. He was shot dead, and his
companion sped away with officers in pursuit. The chase lasted several
minutes, with officers shooting at the fleeing driver until his car burst
into flames on the highway, killing him, the spokesman said. Three
officers were injured. Both Palestinians were strapped with explosive
belts, and their car contained pipe bombs and guns, according to reports.</TE>
<TE>   West Bank leaders of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, said the group
planned the attack. They said the men planned to detonate explosives at
the base and spray it with gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   The incident tied up traffic for hours, but commentators praised the
police for averting a disaster and lifting morale, which had been
seriously battered by three days of embarrassing security failures.</TE>
<TE>   This morning the army said that overnight it captured three would-be
suicide bombers in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Palestinian militants destroyed an Israeli tank and
killed three of its crew members. On Friday, they killed a soldier at a
West Bank roadblock. And on Saturday, a 20-year-old from Kalkilya, in the
West Bank, blew himself up in a crowd of Jewish teenagers in the nearby
settlement of Karnei Shomron, killing two 15-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, the commanding officer of an elite undercover
army unit died when a wall fell on him during an operation in a West Bank
village Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is nearing a situation of a complete
loss of control," wrote analyst Rubik Rosenthal in the daily newspaper
Maariv. "Ariel Sharon's strategy is collapsing. Never in Israel's history
have so many civilians been killed in terror attacks as in the past year.
The [Israel Defense Forces] is protecting itself, and that too is with
limitations, but is incapable of protecting the civilians."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians, Rosenthal said, "are losing the battles to a
superior force, but Israel is losing the war."</TE>
<TE>   Cracks have begun to appear in Israeli national unity, which for
months appeared nearly monolithic in its response to a perceived
existential threat from the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "The government, the army and we are moving about in shock, hurting
and worried, with no sign of hope, initiative or vision," wrote Amnon
Dankner, editor of Maariv.</TE>
<TE>   A protest movement launched last month by reserve combat soldiers and
officers refusing to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip drew the
Cabinet's attention Sunday, with Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
suggesting that the army give the dissenters a platform to voice their
criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer suggested opening a dialogue with the men--more than 200
of whom have signed a published letter saying they won't defend Jewish
settlements or carry out orders they consider immoral against Palestinian
civilians. Sharon rejected the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The reservists' public protest continues to stir debate here as no
other criticism of the army's conduct in the conflict has, and it has
spurred the dispirited left into action. A coalition of peace groups,
which had been unable to attract a crowd since peace talks collapsed and
violence erupted in September 2000, drew several thousand to a Tel Aviv
rally Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The grass-roots protest movement Peace Now launched a new campaign at
the rally to "withdraw from the territories and return to ourselves."
Peace Now leader Galia Golan said the group realizes it runs the risk of
alienating the Israeli public by calling for peace talks as Palestinian
attacks continue, "but we are sensing a change in the public mood out
there."</TE>
<TE>   What remains unclear is whether the public's increasing desperation
for a solution will lead to negotiations or to an escalation of attacks
on the Palestinian Authority and Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Uzi Landau, the hard-line minister of internal security, urged Cabinet
ministers Sunday to take an uncompromising approach.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to fight the terror and, like AIDS, you don't negotiate with
it, you win it," Landau said.</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure Minister Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the far-right
National Union, directed his criticism at Sharon, saying the government's
policy drift is what happens when "you don't have a clear political
destination and your security reactions are confused."</TE>
<TE>   Even Communications Minister Reuven Rivlin, a close Sharon ally, said
the government has to "seriously contemplate the path we have followed so
far, whether it is the right way or maybe it has to be altered."</TE>

<HD>Rebels Kill 129 in Nepal, Officials Say</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>Communist rebels killed at least 129 police, soldiers and civilians
in unprecedented attacks in northwestern Nepal on Sunday, officials said,
undermining prospects for peace in this poor Himalayan kingdom still
recovering from the shock of a massacre at the royal palace last year.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks on government offices and an airport were the deadliest
since the rebels began fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy in
1996.</LD>
<LD>   The rebels, who draw their inspiration from Chinese revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung, abandoned peace talks and ended a cease-fire in
November, saying negotiations had produced no results. The government
declared a state of emergency three days later.</LD>
<TE>   Early Sunday, the rebels set fire to buildings and fired at police in
the town of Mangalsen, the administrative center of the Achham district,
killing 49 police officers, the Interior Security Ministry said in a
statement. Mangalsen is more than 300 miles northwest of the capital,
Katmandu.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas then attacked a small airport in the nearby town of
Sanphebaga, killing another 27 policemen standing guard, a Home Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-eight Royal Nepalese Army soldiers stationed in Mangalsen were
also killed, Defense Ministry spokesman Bhola Silwal said in a separate
news release.</TE>
<TE>   Others killed in the attacks included the district's chief
administrator, a central intelligence bureau official and his wife, a
postal worker and a civilian.</TE>

<HD>Living With Loss in Afghan Camp</HD>
<DH>Refuge: Thousands displaced by drought rely on the limited
offerings of Maslakh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP MASLAKH, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As Mohammed Ismail made his rounds just after sunrise, the cemetery
at Maslakh camp was already busy. The gravediggers swung their picks, and
the frozen gray earth was split open for four fresh graves.</LD>
<LD>   In a typical week, 29 people die at this barren camp for internally
displaced people in far western Afghanistan. Ismail, a displaced person
himself, is paid to unearth the particulars of the dead--name, date and
cause of death, home district and perhaps an estimated age.</LD>
<LD>   By 10 a.m., Ismail had questioned the bereaved and learned that on
this brutally cold day, a 3-day-old girl named Hawa died of a blood
infection. A 10-day-old boy named Abdul Raziq died of a bacterial
infection. A 65-year-old woman named Fatima died after a fall. And a
70-year-old named Khair Mohammed died for reasons unknown.</LD>
<TE>   Both the dead and the living are obliged to remain in Camp Maslakh,
carved out of a desert plateau in Herat province along the highway to
Iran. A mile wide and more than three miles long, the camp is a
rudimentary home to between 160,000 and 270,000 Afghan peasants who have
been driven from their homes by a four-year drought.</TE>
<TE>   By most estimates, Maslakh is either the largest or second-largest
camp in the world for displaced people. Afghanistan has 950,000 displaced
people within its borders, according to international relief agencies,
and 6 million hungry people in a nation where 85% of the population
relies on home-grown crops.</TE>
<TE>   Maslakh is a place where residents swarm around any visiting
Westerner, pleading for money, food or fuel. Children squat in the dirt
for hours, waiting for their turn to race to kitchen windows for bowls of
porridge. Human excrement smears the worn dirt pathways, where many
residents walk barefoot in subfreezing temperatures. Children often fall
into pits dug for latrines. Camp guards swat, with rope and rifle butts,
at residents surging around the food distribution centers. Former Taliban
fighters prowl the camp, residents say, and armed men have threatened aid
workers.</TE>
<TE>   So many people have made their way here from surrounding foothills and
mountains that the camp directors fear it will become a permanent home
for people grown dependent on donated food and shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real danger of depleting the countryside of its
population," said Rafael Robillard of the International Organization for
Migration, which coordinates humanitarian assistance at the camp.</TE>
<TE>   As wretched as life is in Maslakh, with its swirling dust and howling
winds, it is preferable to what residents left behind. The drought has
robbed them of their crops, their livestock, their homes and, for many,
loved ones who died before they could escape.</TE>
<TE>   "The wheat died, the cows died, people died. And now we fear we're
dying here at Maslakh," said Mohammed Juma, who brought his family of
eight to the camp nine months ago from Ghor province and lives now in a
tent.</TE>
<TE>   The graveyards are expanding and encroaching on the highway. There are
four now, with gravediggers chipping away at a fifth. Roughly half of the
untold number of dead are children under 5, according to the United
Nations World Food Program.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the infant mortality rate is slightly lower for the camp than for
Afghanistan as a whole, said Alejandro Chicheri of the WFP. And a
malnourished child has a far better chance of survival here than in the
mountains, thanks to a food and medical program run by Doctors Without
Borders, a private aid group. Among the camp's 39,000 preschool-age
children, only 75 to 85 are treated for severe malnutrition on a given
day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that conditions at Maslakh are hardly ideal, but we are
still getting people from two and three provinces away," Chicheri said.
"How do you make a safe, clean camp without attracting people from all
over? That's our Catch-22."</TE>
<TE>   To keep people in other provinces from coming here to avoid war and
drought, the WFP and the International Committee of the Red Cross are
concentrating food distribution in areas of endangered population in
neighboring Ghor and Badghisj provinces. Officials plan to gradually shut
down this site and move people to a new camp south of the city of Herat,
the provincial capital. Maslakh is home to thousands of unregistered
people and nomads who don't qualify as internally displaced. The new camp
will allow for proper screening and registration, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   They also hope to control petty crime. Donated food and materials from
Maslakh can be found for sale in Herat's markets, and some people in the
camp register more than once to obtain extra rations. Officials say
factions of Northern Alliance fighters have competed for the right to
collect baksheesh, or gratuities, from residents in return for a choice
spot at the head of a line for food or wood stoves.</TE>
<TE>   Maslakh's population was just 100,000 in June. Many abandoned the camp
after the U.S. bombing campaign began in October, then drifted back after
fighting ended here in mid-November. Now thousands of residents have said
that they want to return home. But winter snows have blocked mountain
roads, and the drought makes spring planting a risk.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Maslakh endures, a testament to the resiliency of a
population that has been buffeted by 23 years of war.</TE>
<TE>   Residents live in mud huts and tents with earthen floors, surviving on
a 110-pound bag of wheat a month for each family. Except for those who
hike into the mountains for hours to collect brush for firewood, there is
little to do except wait until it is time to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "We do nothing but spend our days sick and afraid," said Amina, 58,
who, like many Afghans, goes by one name. Amina arrived at the camp with
her husband and six children two months ago after a four-day trip from
Badghis. "But here we have food, and so we stay."</TE>
<TE>   From inside his vest pocket, camp resident Abdullah Jalal, 55,
withdrew a red plastic wallet that contained a folded slip of paper. It
listed children from his 23-member clan who had died at the camp since
the family arrived nine months ago. There were eight, from day-old Zainab
to year-old Mohammed to 8-year-old Hesamuddin.</TE>
<TE>   There were more dead every day at the cemetery outside Camp One, one
of several smaller camps that make up Maslakh. There, Mohammed Ismail
dutifully registered the names of those in the new graves. He was pleased
to have the job. A "grave enumerator," as he is called, earns about $18 a
month, a fine sum in Afghanistan. He has no idea how many people are
buried at Camp One. "They come so fast I can't keep up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail showed his lists of the recent dead to Dr. Ahmed Fahim, a camp
physician. Fahim read aloud some of the typical causes of death:
tuberculosis, hepatitis, diarrhea, malaria, exposure and respiratory
tract infections. During a rare series of rainstorms last month, 70
people died in flash floods, Fahim said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the doctor's office lay a deep hole into which the gravediggers
lowered Fatima, the 65-year-old woman who died after a fall. Her body had
been washed and wrapped in a white funeral shroud by family members;
Fahim said a new camp mortuary will provide such services.</TE>
<TE>   Fatima was buried according to Muslim custom, with her head to the
north and her face to the west. After the gravediggers packed Fatima's
shrouded body with mud and shoveled the dirt back into the grave, male
relatives piled stones atop the burial mound. They added broken glass to
discourage camp boys from taking the stones.</TE>
<TE>   Like most families, Fatima's survivors placed a large gray stone at
the head and foot of the grave, linking the two with a strand of cloth
torn from the shroud.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail stood to the side as an imam led prayers, chanting verses from
the Koran. One of the dead woman's sons, Hayatullah, reached out and
touched her grave with his forefinger as he prayed. Another son,
Mehraban, was offered condolences and said: "Everyone dies. We all must
die."</TE>
<TE>   The imam finished the prayers and the mourners chanted the Dari word
ahmeen, amen. It was only after the mourners left, driven back to their
huts by a punishing winter wind, that the two sons of Fatima allowed
themselves to bow their heads and weep.</TE>

<HD>Yemen Confirms Detention of 5 Terror Alert Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
</DL>
<LD>Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh confirmed in comments published
Sunday that his country had detained five people named in a recent U.S.
terror alert for suspected links to Osama bin Laden's militant network
and said more were being sought.</LD>
<LD>   Yemen has been on heightened alert since the FBI issued a warning Feb.
11 about a possible attack on U.S. interests in the poor Arab country by
Al Qaeda members.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI also published a list of the names of 17 people it suspected
of involvement in the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Saleh told the Arabic-language daily Al Hayat that the five detainees
included state sector employees and students. They were among a group of
84 people Yemen had detained for suspected links to Al Qaeda and other
militant groups.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen has arrested scores of people for questioning since the Sept. 11
attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Saleh said the 84 detainees included people with suspected links to
the 2000 bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole, in which 17 U.S. servicemen
were killed. Yemen is still probing the suicide attack, which occurred in
the port of Aden.</TE>
<TE>   The main targets of a Yemeni manhunt for suspected backers of Al Qaeda
were still at large, Saleh told the daily.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign continues to hunt Abu Ali al-Harthi and Abu Asem
al-Ahdal," Saleh said, using the suspected militants' aliases. The U.S.
has identified them as Qaed Salim Sunian Harethi and Mohammed Hamdi
Ahdal. "God willing, in the very near future they will submit to
interrogations."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if U.S. investigators were helping question detainees, Saleh
said, "The Americans did not participate in the interrogations, and they
will not participate."</TE>
<TE>   Yemen says such U.S. involvement would violate the country's
constitution. American agents have passed on questions through Yemeni
investigators.</TE>

<HD>Frustrated Afghans Get a Lift to Mecca</HD>
<DH>Religion: Britain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Pakistan provide planes

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Britain said Sunday that it had sent four Hercules aircraft to
Kabul to help airlift hundreds of Afghans to Saudi Arabia for the annual
hajj, or pilgrimage.</LD>
<LD>   Answering a request from Afghanistan's interim prime minister, Hamid
Karzai, an Afghan aviation authority official said Saudi Arabia had sent
a Boeing 747 and Pakistan had sent an Airbus A-310 to help transport
pilgrims.</LD>
<LD>   The United Arab Emirates was sending several aircraft to carry 1,000
pilgrims, UAE's official news agency, WAM, reported.</LD>
<TE>   About 8,000 frustrated Muslim pilgrims have been camped out in
freezing temperatures at the Kabul airport and the city's main mosque for
days waiting for flights for the journey to the holy city of Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense said four C-130
Hercules aircraft would transport about 500 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia on
Sunday and would repeat the operation today and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The pilgrims, from all over Afghanistan, have paid $1,500 each for
tickets to make the journey, a small fortune for ordinary Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the promised flights have failed to materialize, leading
to scenes of chaos at the airport. On Sunday, a rowdy crowd surged toward
the heavily guarded departure terminal, shattering a huge window.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here for three nights," said Khoja Abdullah, a stooped man
wrapped in a gray blanket. "There is no order. Everyone is trying to push
in."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai told reporters Sunday that he was trying to ensure that all the
pilgrims would be able to make the journey.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past two days I have done nothing but hajj, the whole
government has stopped to work on the hajj, so everybody's working on the
hajj to make sure the whole thing takes place," Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Saudi Arabia had agreed to extend a Sunday deadline to allow
the Afghan pilgrims to reach Mecca.</TE>

<LD>An Australian soldier fighting with the U.S.-led coalition in
Afghanistan was killed in a land mine explosion Saturday, the government
said Sunday, announcing the country's first fatality in the war against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The soldier, who was not identified but was a member of the Special
Air Service Regiment, died in southern Afghanistan late Saturday of
wounds received from what was believed to be an anti-vehicle mine,
Defense Minister Robert M. Hill said.</LD>
<LD>   Army chief Lt. Gen. Peter Cosgrove later confirmed the statement. The
soldier was one of five in a vehicle at the head of a convoy. The Defense
Department said there were no reports of injuries to the other four
soldiers.</LD>

<HD>WTC Scrap Is Hazardous, Activists Say</HD>
<DH>Asia: Greenpeace complains that the metal is contaminated and
endangering recyclers in India.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>For scrap trader Sashi Kumar, the collapse of the World Trade
Center towers five months ago has become a "daily headache."</LD>
<LD>   His problems began last month when a routine shipload of steel scrap
arrived in the southern port of Chennai. This time, the 33,000-ton
shipment apparently included material salvaged from the site of the trade
center.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental and labor activists say the scrap was contaminated by
other debris from the twin towers--such as cancer-causing asbestos,
polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, mercury and lead--and they accused
the United States of dumping "toxic and hazardous material" in India.
They have launched an aggressive campaign calling for a halt to further
movement of the scrap.</LD>
<TE>   "What I have purchased is just steel scrap," said Kumar, 36. "I
believe it may contain some scrap from the WTC site, but there is no
label, no sticker on the scrap that says it is WTC scrap. Now it has
become a headache for me."</TE>
<TE>   The city of New York has decided to sell 175,000 tons of steel scrap
from the trade center, despite emotional appeals from relatives of some
of the 2,838 people killed there on Sept. 11. Some of it is going to U.S.
cities, but about 60,000 tons have been sold to companies in India, China
and South Korea, where it will be turned into everything from appliances
and bridges to car parts and even new skyscrapers. China's largest steel
company, Shanghai Baosteel, has denied reports that it plans to make
souvenirs from the metal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not normal demolition steel scrap," said Anantha Padmanabhan,
executive director of Greenpeace India. "Just look at the circumstances
in which the twin towers came down. High-temperature incineration with
jet fuel has taken place. This is incineration steel."</TE>
<TE>   "Each office in the WTC had computers, chip boards, tube lights,
electrical lights, video and computer monitors, plastics and furniture,"
he said. "There is every possibility that high levels of toxins are in
the debris that would pose serious health and environmental risks to
uninformed recycling workers in India."</TE>
<TE>   Indian port authorities conducted no tests on Kumar's cargo when it
arrived because it was imported as general steel scrap, which is legal in
India. About 700,000 to 800,000 tons of scrap are imported into the
country every year for recycling and reuse. The low import tariffs on
steel scrap make it more attractive than using what is available in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Kumar's New York scrap has already been sent to be used in
construction, but he has agreed to allow a Greenpeace team to inspect the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   More steel scrap from the World Trade Center has arrived in the
western Indian port of Kandla, and a third shipment is bound for the
eastern city of Calcutta later this month, Greenpeace said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the label 'WTC scrap.' In this trade, I don't ask
questions about the source of the scrap," said Kumar, who has been in the
scrap business five years.</TE>
<TE>   But all the controversy about his latest consignment has made him
wary. Recently, he received photographs of demolished bridges in the
United States and an offer to buy the scrap from the debris.</TE>
<TE>   "I said no, let's not even talk about it. Maybe after all this I
should just say I want disaster-free scrap."</TE>
<TE>   Kumar said the events of Sept. 11 weigh on him.</TE>
<TE>   "If I think about the enormous tragedy, I feel very sad," he said. "I
don't want to make a commercial deal out of disasters. But if I had said
no, somebody else would have used it. It has to be used ultimately. It
can't be thrown into water."</TE>

<HD>In Dance With China, Bush Must Take the Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America's complex engagement with China defies flat conclusions and
bright lines. The two nations connect and collide on so many different
fronts that the relationship is never moving solely in one direction.
Almost always, it is getting better and worse, simultaneously.</LD>
<LD>   With so much at stake, the U.S. can't afford the luxury of allowing
any single issue to dominate its relations with China. That principle
proved a good compass in the 1990s, when China critics repeatedly sought
to end normal trading relations with Beijing because of its domestic
repression. Though conflicted, Congress annually rejected the drive
because it meant, in effect, sublimating all our other economic and
political interests in China to our justifiable concern about human
rights.</LD>
<LD>   The same principle of balance ought to apply now. As President Bush
prepares to visit China later this week, it may be tempting to elevate
Chinese support for the war against terror--and tolerance of Bush's
harder line against North Korea--above all other goals. But that would be
a mistake, as Bush and his team appear to recognize.</LD>
<TE>   China's support for the struggle against terror, though refreshing, is
too peripheral to push off the table America's legitimate and enduring
problems with Chinese behavior, at home and abroad. That list of
complaints starts with China's repression of its own people. If China's
abuses shouldn't define the relationship, neither can they be minimized.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, China has taken some steps to reduce tension in the run-up
to Bush's visit. As always, though, that is a relative measure: Is it a
signal of progress that China recently agreed to release a Hong Kong man
accused of smuggling unapproved Bibles, or a testament to the problem
that he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the first place? And
the overall trend line remains dispiriting.</TE>
<TE>   In its latest annual report, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch
said that in 2001, China "tightened controls on fundamental freedoms. The
leadership turned to trusted tools, limiting free expression by arresting
academics, closing newspapers and magazines, strictly controlling
Internet content, and utilizing a refurbished [anti-crime] campaign to
circumvent legal safeguards for criminal suspects and alleged
separatists, terrorists and so-called religious extremists."</TE>
<TE>   It was in America's interest for China to gain admission to the World
Trade Organization last year. But China's entry did make it more
challenging to respond to Beijing's human rights provocations. During the
1990s, the annual congressional debate on China's trading status provided
activists both a forum to publicize its record and a lever to push for
change. The U.S., though, permanently granted China normal trading
privileges when it entered the WTO, ending these annual debates.</TE>
<TE>   That raises the importance of stressing human rights at meetings like
Bush's visit this week. Human rights advocates are hoping Bush will
repeat his admirably blunt message at an Asian summit in Shanghai last
fall that no nation should use the war against terror as an excuse to
crack down on its ethnic minorities, as China has been doing with Islamic
separatists in its remote Xinjiang region. And the activists are hoping
for a strong defense of individual liberty when Bush speaks at a Chinese
university Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "There are opportunities for dialogue, for talks, but I don't think
any of it has a chance of making any real impact unless the political
pressure is stepped up as well," says Human Rights Watch's Mike
Jendrzejczyk.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding freedom in China won't ever be easy. Any progress will
demand not only persistence but creativity. In a diplomatic jujitsu,
Jendrzejczyk says the U.S. might find leverage in China's entry into the
WTO, the same development that's eliminated the threat of unilateral U.S.
trade sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   To join the WTO club, China has agreed to build a sturdier legal
structure for business transactions. That could provide an opening for
Bush to push China to begin liberating its overall legal and judicial
system from Communist Party control. "As you pursue a rule of law
structure that China [needs] to live within a rule-based trading system,
that is going to spill over into these questions of human rights and
other legal issues," agrees Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), a
congressional leader on China trade.</TE>
<TE>   Bush needs to keep his eyes on security issues too. The United States
is still concerned about China's military buildup (though it's tougher
for an America engaging in its own gargantuan expansion to complain about
anyone else's military spending). And China, though excluded from Bush's
"axis of evil," has its own long history of proliferating weapons of mass
destruction; just last month the U.S. sanctioned China after two
companies were caught selling to Iran equipment that could be used for
chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "They have given their word at least six times to restrain their
proliferation behavior," says John J. Tkacik, a China research fellow at
the conservative Heritage Foundation. "They have signed on the bottom
line; they have promised; they have said . . . they are setting up an
export control regime. But they never do it."</TE>
<TE>   The picture, as always, isn't entirely bleak. China played a
constructive role in defusing the India-Pakistan standoff. Beijing has
made some conciliatory noises lately toward Taiwan. A senior Bush
administration official said last week that China has made "some small
progress" on proliferation. And its leaders mostly bit their lip when
listening devices were found in a U.S.-built plane delivered for Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   With China, though, progress always comes as the conjoined twin of
frustration. No one is expecting many breakthroughs at this week's
meeting; the visit even seems like a bit of a sideshow as the central
focus in U.S. foreign policy (and even more so in American reporting on
foreign policy) has turned toward terrorism and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's for the best. Like an aging actor, America's relationship
with China doesn't do well in the spotlight; there's always a blemish to
catch the glare. Less attention may actually give Bush more freedom to
balance our interests and ideals in a relationship that constantly
challenges both.</TE>

<LD>Arlington National Cemetery is expanding by 60 acres to make room
to receive another generation of honored dead.</LD>
<LD>   Cemetery planners rely on demographics and topography to predict that
the expansion, the first since the '60s, will add 35 years to the life of
Arlington cemetery, allowing it to accept fallen warriors until 2060.
There should be room for 350,000 more veterans, dignitaries and
unforeseen heroes, an average of 6,000 per year.</LD>

<DH></DH>

<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The leading Senate opponent of the campaign finance legislation
that cleared the House last week suggested Sunday that he may filibuster
the bill in a last-ditch effort to force changes that could derail the
reform effort.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has long led an effort to block new
limits on political spending, said he was "pretty confident" he had the
41 votes he needs to uphold a potential filibuster--the last
congressional obstacle to the most sweeping rewrite of the campaign
finance laws in a quarter-century.</LD>
<LD>   "Unless at some point 60 senators decide to let it pass, it will not
pass," McConnell said on "Fox News Sunday."</LD>
<TE>   But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the legislation's leading Senate
supporter, expressed confidence that the measure--which has been debated
in one form or another since the late 1980s--will finally reach the
president's desk this year. "I am confident that, over time, we will
prevail," McCain said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign reform legislation would prohibit national political
parties from raising and spending the unlimited, virtually unregulated
"soft money" contributions that have become the fastest-growing source of
money in politics. In the 2000 election, the two parties combined to
raise nearly $500 million in soft money. The legislation would also bar
independent groups, such as the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Assn.,
from using soft money to buy campaign ads in the last 60 days before an
election.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved its version of the legislation in April; the House
cleared the bill in a dramatic vote last week. But because the House made
small changes in the legislation, the Senate must vote again to accept
the House version--or else take their differences to a conference
committee, which supporters fear would become the bill's graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is sent to conference, it's dead," Rep. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.), the co-sponsor of the legislation in the House, said on CBS'
"Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   The supporters' position in the Senate remains precarious because it
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster, if McConnell or other opponents
launch one. When it passed the Senate last year, the bill attracted 59
votes.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, both McConnell and McCain insisted that they had enough
support to prevail. McConnell noted that Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who
had voted for the bill, now says he will support a filibuster. "I think I
will have 41 at the very least . . . to allow us to make changes that may
be necessary," McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   But McCain said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who initially
opposed the bill, has indicated that he would vote to break a filibuster.
"I believe there are other senators who will do so also, even if they
oppose the legislation," McCain added.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell predicted that even if the legislation becomes law, reform
advocates may well be disappointed by its effect. He argued that the
courts are likely to strike down the provisions limiting the election
activities of independent groups. That, he said, would simply redirect
the soft money now flowing into the parties toward special-interest
groups, amplifying their power at the expense of the official Democratic
and Republican organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't going to take any money out of politics," McConnell said.
"It's just going to . . . shift it to outside groups."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has not signaled his intentions on the bill. But he has
never threatened to veto it, and most analysts believe that he would sign
it if it reaches his desk. "There were mixed signals sent from the White
House during the House debate," said McCain, Bush's principal rival for
the 2000 Republican nomination, "but I hope he will sign it."</TE>

<HD>Ice Storm Takes a Toll on Oklahoma Trees</HD>
<DH>Weather: In a state where trees are heritage, the damage cuts
residents to the quick and may forever scar the land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KINGFISHER, Okla.
</DL>
<LD>The trees of Memory Lane, sturdy as the soldiers they were planted
to honor, once were majestic. Now they are heartbreaking.</LD>
<LD>   They teeter and tip at crazy angles. Broken branches spike from every
limb. Some trees are snapped in half. Others are so tangled in their own
shredded branches that they look, from afar, like giant birds' nests,
clumped and matted.</LD>
<LD>   An ice storm recently crashed through here, the worst anyone in these
parts can remember. It ravaged the cemetery grove known as Memory
Lane--and much beyond. The storm tore up trees all across northwest
Oklahoma and on through Kansas. The ice wrapped each limb in a glittering
death grip, inches thick. Even the most massive branches cracked under
the weight. Even the most hearty trunks bent double.</LD>
<TE>   In many towns, this one among them, the parks and cemeteries and
courthouse squares will never look the same. Cedars and elms, pecans and
hackberries, oaks and pines and persimmon trees are smashed. Cottonwoods
that shaded a century of picnic suppers have toppled.</TE>
<TE>   The loss cuts deep. For here on the wide-open plains of America's
heartland, trees mean more than shade and grace.</TE>
<TE>   They are history. They are identity.</TE>
<TE>   "We value our trees," 84-year-old Maxine Cleaver explained.
"Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Because on the prairie, for people
to have these trees was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The first photographs of western Oklahoma show unrelenting
desolation--flat prairie punching ever forward to a horizon ever out of
reach. The pioneers who lined up in Kingfisher at high noon on April 22,
1889 had a clear shot to forever when a representative of the U.S.
government officially opened the plain to white settlers. In wagons, on
horseback and on foot, they raced through the empty prairie to stake
claim to 160-acre tracts.</TE>
<TE>   Once they had established shelter (and saloons and gambling houses),
one of their first priorities was planting trees.</TE>
<TE>   They dug up the elms that grew along creek beds and moved them to
their yards and public squares--to any place where they wanted a bit of
shade, a reminder of the stately streets back East, a shelter from the
wicked prairie winds.</TE>
<TE>   The land here is not made for trees. The soil is sandy, the summers
are scorching. The wind can be merciless. But the pioneers nurtured those
elms until they took.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, in the grip of the Dust Bowl, their grandchildren would
do the same. A decade of drought and wind had scoured the plains of
green. So President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a belt of trees planted
from Texas north to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative transformed the Great Plains. From 1935 to 1942, at
least 30 million trees were planted--forming a giant windbreak that
protected crops from erosion. Old-timers here still remember fetching
water in tin buckets to douse each precious root. Many of those Dust Bowl
trees still were blocking the wind when the ice storm struck.</TE>
<TE>   Now? "Oh, gosh," said Steve Loftis, the emergency management director
for this town of 5,000. "Every street in town--every street in every town
in northwest Oklahoma--has damage to its trees."</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me sick," said Fred Beers, who lives northeast of here in
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   At 77, Beers is the unofficial historian of Perry, another town of
5,000. He's fond of telling how one Mr. Little, irate over the indignity
of having a buffalo wallow in town, planted hundreds of elms in the 1890s
to transform a ragged frontier settlement into a proper home. Most of
those original trees were long gone before the storm. Dozens of majestic
elms replaced them, framing the old buffalo wallow--now a courthouse
square.</TE>
<TE>   "The trees made a graceful green oasis in the middle of the town,"
Beers said. "Now it looks like a war zone."</TE>
<TE>   The storm that caused so much damage seemed deceptively mild at first.
There was no wind, no hail, not even bitter cold. There was just freezing
rain. But it lasted for nearly three days--from Jan. 30 through Feb.
1--glazing every limb and line with ice. Elms 40 and 50 feet tall bent
under the weight. Power wires dragged the ground.</TE>
<TE>   More rain fell. More ice collected. And with thunderous cracks, things
began to topple.</TE>
<TE>   In Kingfisher County alone, nearly 6,000 power poles were toppled; in
one 22-mile stretch, not a single pole was left standing, Loftis said.
Even though crews have been called in from as far as Florida, the power
company has warned some rural residents that they might not get
electricity back until Easter.</TE>
<TE>   No one has even tried to count how many trees were destroyed across
the Plains, or in Kingfisher alone. They just know it's devastating, said
Kurt Atkinson of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   In one yard here, a trunk easily 12 feet in circumference fell over,
tearing up the driveway. In another, a pecan tree so enormous it produced
300 pounds of nuts a year has been stripped of nearly all its branches.</TE>
<TE>   The noise of tumbling limbs echoed across Kingfisher--across the
region--for two days.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the house just a-ducking and a-dodging. All that crashing
made the whole house shake," Kingfisher resident Betty Tisdale recalled.
"I kept thinking: 'There goes another one. And another one.' "</TE>
<TE>   When she emerged to check the damage, she had lost 19 trees. Her yard
now looks like it's ready for a competition in chain saw art. The
squirrels are so bewildered, Tisdale throws them pecans out of pity.</TE>
<TE>   Arborists are warning property owners not to rush to chop; even if
just 30% of a tree's branches are intact, it has a shot at surviving. But
the older trees likely will die. And experts are urging removal of
specimens that are not well suited to Oklahoma's climate, such as
Bradford pears and Siberian elms.</TE>
<TE>   Even those trees that make it will look mighty ragged this summer--and
for several summers to come.</TE>
<TE>   Down at Memory Lane, planted in the 1950s along the road leading to
the cemetery to pay homage to World War II veterans, virtually every tree
lost its crown. Limbs 14 feet long litter the grass. Raw branches,
stripped of bark, poke up from trunks helter-skelter. The mile-long strip
of trees looks downright spooky.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a shock to see what we've got left," said Eldon Trindle,
80, who helps maintain the grove. "You just don't have much of a fight
against Mother Nature when she's going that way."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Boevers, an agricultural advisor with Oklahoma State University,
can only agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sickening. One weather event ruins all the time and effort
that's been invested in these trees since the land run of 1889," he said.
Then he straightened. "You just have to step back, regroup and replant,"
he said.</TE>
