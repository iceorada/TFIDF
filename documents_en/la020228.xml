<LD>Patrick Marber has won critical huzzahs as one of the most important
new British playwrights. "Dealer's Choice," first produced in 1995,
was his debut. Its framework is a high-stakes weekly poker game in a
London restaurant; Marber probes the six characters' desires and
obligations as they place their bets. The work is informed by a
compulsive gambling problem the 36-year-old writer says he struggled
with during his days at Oxford. "Dealer's Choice" and its even more
acclaimed successor, the edgy examination of contemporary sexual
manners, "Closer," have summoned comparisons to the elite likes of
David Mamet, Harold Pinter, Joe Orton and Tom Stoppard. Marber's
third play, "Howard Katz," about an ordinary man's rejection of his
world, recently opened in London. Stages' mounting of "Dealer's
Choice" is the first production of a Marber play in Orange County.

<LD>Independent filmmaker Caveh Zahedi has a theory that film's highest
purpose is to show reality. He has pursued it in a series of cheaply
made autobiographical movies starring himself. Zahedi's
fans--including director Richard Linklater, who cast Zahedi as
himself in "Waking Life"--say these seemingly self-obsessed works are
distinctive and valuable because they speak universally. The San
Francisco-based Zahedi, a graduate of UCLA's film school, is not shy
about revealing his flaws, neuroses and episodes of questionable
behavior. He has emerged as a sort of underground, nonfictional Woody
Allen. "In the Bathtub of the World" is a video diary of his life
over a year, focusing on his money and career woes and his
often-stormy relationship with his girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   "In the Bathtub of the World," followed by a Q&amp;A with Caveh
Zahedi. Thursday, 7:30 p.m., Humanities Instructional Building, Room
100, near West Peltason and Pereira drives on the UC Irvine campus.

reigning--but married--queen of high society in St. Petersburg. Opera
Pacific presents "Onegin," its first Russian opera, in a Lyric Opera
of Chicago production staged by Colin Graham and conducted by Stephen
Lord, music director of the Boston Lyric Opera and the Opera Theatre
of St. Louis. Two casts will alternate in the principal roles.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   The 1965 musical "Promenade" is one of more than 40 plays and
stage adaptations that the Havana-born New Yorker, Maria Irene
Fornes, has written over 39 years. It earned her one of her nine Obie
awards, given for off-the-mainstream stage excellence in New York.
Fornes, 71, never has scored a commercial breakthrough, but in
addition to her works, she is respected as a teacher and is regarded
as a mentor to many of the Latino playwrights who have followed her.
"Promenade," with book and lyrics by Fornes and music by Al Carmines,
will be performed by a student cast at UC Irvine. It's an absurdist
parable about two escaped prisoners pursued by a vicious jailer. The
escapees mingle with blithely silly high society folks, confront the
madness of war and eventually conclude that life in secure
confinement beats the inanity and violence of life on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Promenade," Studio Theatre, West Peltason Drive and Mesa Road, UC
Irvine. Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m., Saturdays 2 and 8 p.m. Ends March
9. $8 to $9. (949) 824-2787.</TE>

<HD>'Dealer's Choice' Characters Are Cards, but These Tales
Deserve a Full House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Marber has been compared, often favorably, to David Mamet.
That clicks because both know the difference between real talk and
stagy talk.</LD>
<LD>   The five London guys in Marber's "Dealer's Choice," vividly
produced by Stages Theatre in Fullerton, do prattle on and on. But
it's the kind of gab that sounds so honest and revealing you don't
mind listening in.</LD>
<LD>   And even when Marber, like Mamet, forces things with a glib line
to show how clever he can be, it's just a brief lapse. These blokes
have stories to tell and we want to hear them out.</LD>
<TE>   The way Marber sets it up, the most central and profound falls to
gambling addict Carl (Scott Damian). Carl has another problem as
well--his convoluted relationship with his dad, Steven (Bill
Glassman), would have any shrink doing one of those head-spinning
"Exorcist" moves.</TE>
<TE>   It's the old love-hate thing, built on fear, respect and insight.
Most of that insight, both for us and Carl and Steven, comes during
the heat of a poker game, where father, son and three workers at
Steven's restaurant meet every week. We've already been introduced to
the cook, Sweeney (Richard Warren) and two waiters, Mugsy (Cody R.
Storts) and Frankie (R.C. Ormond), but we'll learn more later on.</TE>
<TE>   It does take Marber a while to get to the meat of "Dealer's
Choice." I felt antsy early on as the jokes bounced between Sweeney,
a single dad living for a time with his daughter, and Mugsy, whose
crackpot plan to turn a public toilet into a restaurant is a
touchstone gag. Even the comic punch of Frankie, the silly
lady-killer bound for Vegas, takes time to pull us in.</TE>
<TE>   Then enters Ash (Eddie Nickerson) and the scrum is on. By this
time, director Steven C. John has found his pace, and so have his
actors. At first glance, Ash may be something of a cliche--the
mysterious villain who has come to collect a debt and who can
evil-stare right through titanium--but Marber soon strips a layer or
two. It helps that Nickerson offers the edgiest performance. The
paranoia Ash creates provides a psychological anchor and catalyst for
this "Dealer's Choice."</TE>
<TE>   It gives the cast some nice opportunities. Damian is able to show
Carl's internal storm as he becomes more aware of his ties to his
father. He handles the last scene, an uncomfortably sentimental one,
with enough understatement to keep it from the bathetic. For the grin
factor, begin with Storts. Mugsy may be the group's doofus mascot,
but his unsinkable humor is infectious.</TE>
<TE>   As for the show's look, the action takes place in two areas, the
kitchen in the back and the restaurant (later the basement for poker)
in front. Set designer Jason Pendergraft has easily divided the
little stage and added details (faded stains on the kitchen walls, a
mishmash of small crates in the basement) to complete a picture of
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "Dealer's Choice," Stages Theatre, 400 E. Commonwealth Ave.,
Fullerton. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. $12 and $15.
Ends March 23. (714) 525-4484.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being keenly aware of the fragility--and the cultural
significance--of their world, theater people tend to rise to the
cause of self-preservation. That may be the underlying story of this
Sunday's concert with acclaimed singer-actress Polly Bergen. Fresh
off a lauded run in the Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim's
"Follies" last year, Bergen will demonstrate her way with a song, in
a show in which David Lander and Michael McKean, of "Laverne &amp;
Shirley" fame, are the hosts.</LD>
<LD>   Before shuddering at the ticket price, note that it's a benefit
for a cause, the Cabrillo Music Theatre. Now eight seasons old, the
musical theater company proudly boasts the tag of official "resident
musical theatre company of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza."
Co-chairing the event is Ryan O'Neal, and there will be a post-show
celebrity auction.</LD>
<LD>   * Polly Bergen, Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 E. Thousand
Oaks Blvd., Sunday, 7 p.m. $125. (805) 583-8700.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Musical Royalty: Speaking of show tunes at the plaza, this weekend
also marks the opening of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic, "The
King and I," presented by the Theater League. This production stars
no less a celebrity than Debbie Boone in the starring role, as Anna.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, Pat Boone's progeny had a tight relationship
with the pop charts, including the chart-topper "You Light Up My
Life" in the late '70s. Though she's off the charts and beyond the
bubblegum pop scene, she's been seen on television lately and has
also used her musical skills to hit the boards in "Sound of Music,"
"Grease" and "Meet Me in St. Louis."</TE>
<TE>   This musical, which opened on Broadway in 1951, was later adapted
into two films. It contributed standard tunes to the American
songbook, such as "I Whistle a Happy Tune," "Shall We Dance" and
"Getting to Know You." Fifty years later, they qualify as timeless.</TE>
<TE>   * Theater League presents "The King and I," March 2-10, Thousand
Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd. Tuesdays to
Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m.; No
matinee March 2. $25.50 to 39.50. (805) 583-8700.</TE>

<TE>   Musical Chairs: Within the last month, the three prominent music
organizations in Ventura County made announcements from their various
headquarters regarding shifts in the directorial foundation.</TE>
<TE>   At the New West Symphony, the news is that things will be business
as usual. The orchestra's founding conductor, Boris Brott, received a
contract extension through the completion of the young ensemble's
10th-anniversary season in 2005. The itinerant Brott, based in
Hamilton, Ontario, has proven a valuable figure in the region's
orchestral life.</TE>
<TE>   Another high point of Ventura's classical music calendar is the
fairly young but solid institution, the Ventura Chamber Music
Festival, bringing chamber music to town every May for the last eight
years. After a nationwide search, the festival has hired Patricia
Mastic Young to fill the full-time executive director job. This
year's festival, May 2-12, will feature the celebrated pianist Alicia
de Larrocha.</TE>
<TE>   Directorial musical chairs is also in store for the Ojai Festival,
Ventura County's most important musical event of the year. Ernest
Fleischmann, the former long-standing artistic director of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, has been at the helm of the Ojai Fest since
1998. He will end his tenure there after the 2003 festival (in which
the great Pierre Boulez returns to Ojai).</TE>
<TE>   Following Fleischmann will be Thomas W. Morris, executive director
of the Cleveland Orchestra. Morris will be the first non-Californian
director in the history of the festival, which started in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rock of a Different Age: Decibels will rage, hair will flail and
history will repeat itself when the Ventura Theatre plays host to a
triple bill of old-fashioned Hollywood metal Sunday. The Glam Metal
Fest 2002 ushers us into the musty historical byways of the '80s--the
days before Guns N' Roses gave the genre its heftiest commercial
push.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the field was lorded over by big-haired, high-voiced
bands like Ratt and Faster Pussycat (named after a Russ Meyer film,
continuing the ironic Hollywood sleaze factor) and Gilby Clarke, who
was in Guns N' Roses for a spell. Despite the live-fast/die-young
mythology they aspire to, they're all alive and pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   * "Glam Metal Fest 2002," with Faster Pussycat, Gilby Clarke and
Ratt, Sunday, Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura. Doors
open at 7 p.m. Tickets are $20 to $30; 653-0118,

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD B. ANDERSON and GREGORY HELMS</AU>
<BD>Richard B. Anderson is a writer in Santa Barbara.
Gregory Helms is program manager at the Channel Islands field office
of the Ocean Conservancy. E-mail: gconserve @aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the first captains ventured out to fish the Georges Bank off New
England, they found schools of fish so thick that they appeared to be
shoals of sand. The fishery created great wealth and sustained the
fishing villages of New England for centuries. Fecund and abundant,
the Georges Bank seemed inexhaustible.</LD>
<LD>   But between 1970 and 1990, more boats and more modern methods of
fishing put the resource under pressure, and traditional methods of
fishery management proved powerless to halt the decline. By the early
1990s, the fishery had been virtually destroyed, and valuable species
were commercially extinct. In 1996, large portions of the Georges
Bank were closed to fishing--permanently. Fishing as a way of life
was gone forever.</LD>
<LD>   What happened at Georges Bank is happening in the waters of the
Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. The marine environment there is
one of the richest in the world, but every indication is that it's
headed for disaster.</LD>
<TE>   The overall tonnage of fish harvested has declined by 80% since
1976. Abalone, once so numerous that they lined the ocean bottom like
cobblestones, have disappeared. Some species of rockfish are close to
extinction, and the fate of most other species is problematic. It's
quite possible that the waters around the Channel Islands will
become, like Georges Bank, an oceanic desert.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial fishermen and environmental groups have spent two years
hashing out an innovative approach to marine conservation in the
Channel Islands waters. This cooperative effort has produced a plan
that would establish a system of no-fishing zones where the marine
environment could be stabilized, studied and perhaps restored to its
former abundance. The proposed marine reserves would include from 12%
to 30% of the waters within the Channel Islands National Marine
Sanctuary. Because the proposal is innovative, it is controversial.
The state Fish and Game Commission held hearings on it; a decision is
expected soon.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, opposition to marine reserves is muted among
commercial fishermen. They can see the fish disappearing and the
catch declining. They know something new must be done, because the
traditional methods of management aren't working.</TE>
<TE>   The real opposition to marine reserves comes from recreational
anglers, who are vociferous and persistent, and their numbers give
them substantial clout with the politicized commission.</TE>
<TE>   The anglers' emotional reactions are understandable. Each
fisherman takes only a few fish on each outing, so it's hard to
believe there could be a substantial impact from that. But there are
a lot of anglers. Collectively, they have an impact equal to
commercial fishermen. The bocaccio, for example, a highly desirable
rockfish among anglers, hasn't been fished commercially for decades.
But recreational fishing has reduced it to 4% of its former numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Any decision will be controversial. Still, the commission has a
responsibility that goes beyond the political. The lesson of Georges
Bank is that it is possible to destroy the future, to rob future
generations of what should have been their heritage. The proposed
reserves would provide refuge for valuable species. They would allow
complex oceanic ecosystems to recover and flourish. And they would
provide an invaluable picture of the undisturbed living sea, against
which the true scale of human impacts could be measured.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen, environmentalists, scientists and the public would all
benefit from the establishment of marine reserves within the Channel
Islands National Marine Sanctuary.</TE>

<HD>Enron Spin Will Define Bush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FABIANI and CHRISTOPHER LEHANE</AU>
<BD>Mark Fabiani and Christopher Lehane, who now manage
crises for corporations, served in the White House counsel's office
from 1994 to 1996, helping manage the Clinton administration's
response to Whitewater and related congressional inquiries.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they struggle to deal with the incessant developments in the Enron
story, President Bush and his advisors undoubtedly are tempted to
follow the tried-and-true tactics of the modern political war room:
Fight hard to win every news cycle by responding to every new twist
and answering every fresh accusation. It is a temptation they must
resist.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Bush administration should face up to a simple but
hard reality: The Enron scandal is going to be nasty, brutish and
long. It's not important what the public thinks about the Enron story
today or tomorrow or even next week. What's important is what the
public believes on two days: election day 2002 and election day 2004.
The administration should focus on this long-term goal.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that's easier said than done. Inside the White House at
times like these, there is tremendous pressure to take action that
will put the administration in the best possible light on that
evening's news and the next day's newspapers.</LD>
<TE>   As the Enron story unfolds, we are reminded of our days in the
White House during Whitewater: hunkered down, voice mail permanently
full of reporters' questions, briefings resembling World Wrestling
Federation smackdowns, document requests piling up like junk mail.</TE>
<TE>   Inside such a maelstrom, bearings are hard to find and mistakes
are easy to make.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Enron fiasco presents some difficult problems for the
president, he may be able to avoid major damage and shape public
opinion in the long term by focusing on the big picture. He should
cooperate fully with all inquiries. He and his advisors should be
careful not to make any public statements that could undermine his
future credibility. And he should show that he understands why this
story is so disturbing to average Americans.</TE>
<TE>   During our time at the White House, we learned that it never paid
to engage in a public fight over access to documents. These fights
inevitably create the perception that you are hiding something--and
these fights are inevitably lost. So Vice President Dick Cheney would
do well to spare his administration the bruising that it will suffer
during the fight and hand over to the General Accounting Office the
documents about his energy task force now.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery over withheld Whitewater documents during the first
two years of the Clinton administration proved to be far more
intriguing than the contents of those documents themselves. That's
because interest in the contents of secreted documents grows for
every day they are withheld.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should simply tell people what it knows,
explain what it doesn't know and be clear about what--if anything--it
is going to do to find out what it doesn't know. This rule,
steadfastly applied, will prevent the release of information that
turns out to be half-baked.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure of the news cycle has forced the administration to
release information about its Enron contacts in an ad hoc manner. It
is better to absorb a pounding through as many news cycles as it
takes to assemble the facts fully and accurately and then release
them all at once. Another benefit of such a disclosure is that with
so many details released simultaneously, some are bound to get more
attention than others.</TE>
<TE>   By far the greatest danger for Bush is that Enron will become
shorthand for the rich getting special treatment while working
families get shafted. There is only one way for him to prevent this:
Convince people that he is truly appalled by what happened at Enron,
that he is taking meaningful steps to help those who were hurt and
that he and his administration will do whatever is necessary to keep
this from happening again.</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough for the president to reveal that his mother-in-law
lost a few thousand dollars. His recent pension reform proposals are
a start, if he can get them past his financial supporters who will
oppose many of the necessary campaign finance, corporate law and
accounting changes.</TE>
<TE>   This is a critical time for Bush. As he fights a dangerous war
abroad, he and his aides must chart a counterintuitive strategy for
this domestic crisis. How disciplined Bush and his aides are in
following their plan will determine whether Enron is a story that
really matters after all.</TE>

<HD>Let's Roll Against Saddam Hussein</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID McCORMICK</AU>
<BD>David McCormick, a former Army combat engineer and
decorated Gulf War veteran, is author of "The Downsized Warrior:
America's Army in Transition" (New York University Press, 1998) and
executive vice president of a technology and services company based
in Pittsburgh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a young lieutenant on the ground just 100 miles south of Baghdad,
President George H.W. Bush's decision to end the Gulf War prematurely
in 1991 made perfect sense. The Iraqi military was devastated,
civilians were suffering, Saddam Hussein's grip on power seemed to
hang by a thread and the inevitable casualties from attacking Baghdad
seemed too high a price to pay.</LD>
<LD>   Things have not turned out as expected. Hussein is still in power
and the Iraqi population continues to suffer. Although we have little
direct evidence since United Nations inspections ended, Iraq's
nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities probably are intact.
With Hussein's inclination toward retribution and weapons of mass
destruction at the ready, Iraq--part of an axis of evil or
not--stands out as a devastating terrorist threat. The former
President Bush and I were wrong. We should have taken out Hussein
when we had the chance. A decade later, President George W. Bush
faces choices similar to those his father did, and there is growing
consensus that this time, Hussein must go.</LD>
<TE>   The "talk, not act" crowd has a long list of reasons to continue
to deploy diplomatic means--U.N.-led inspections, economic sanctions
and political isolation--instead of go against Iraq. They say that
given the lack of evidence of Iraqi culpability for the Sept. 11
attacks, a military assault on Iraq would lack international support,
and that an effective campaign would be more costly and difficult
than in Afghanistan, particularly without support from Iraq's
neighbors. They say that a stable, democratic post-Hussein regime
would be difficult to achieve, and that an assault might prompt
further terrorist attacks on the U.S. or its allies.</TE>
<TE>   While unilateral U.S. action would raise eyebrows abroad, success
would go a long way toward rekindling international support. Regional
allies like Turkey, Jordan, Kuwait and even Saudi Arabia will fall in
line if U.S. action is swift with minimal civilian casualties.
France, Germany, Russia and others will forgive American action once
the threat of Hussein is gone and the new Iraq offers more commercial
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. armed forces are more capable today of crushing Iraq's
military. Advanced technologies, intelligence resources and special
operations forces are far superior to what they were in 1991.
Meanwhile, the poorly equipped Iraqi army is one-third the size it
was, the air force is virtually nonexistent and the loyalty of Iraqi
troops is fragile. While significant ground forces would be needed,
they would be a fraction of those deployed in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Left unchecked, Hussein's ability to deliver weapons of mass
destruction will grow. The terrorists so shockingly successful on
Sept. 11 would have been more devastating had they been armed with
nuclear or biological weapons. While attacking Iraq head-on might
increase the likelihood of Hussein lashing out, it also would force
him to focus on self-preservation, making an orchestrated attack on
the U.S. or allied soil more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Recent success in Afghanistan, lingering outrage over Sept. 11 and
the president's popularity have created the "perfect storm" for
decisive action. The administration must quickly build the case with
key allies, particularly in the Persian Gulf, for why taking the war
to Iraq is critical to their security and ours. The U.S. must provide
more substantial support to the Iraqi National Congress and other
possible participants in a new Iraqi regime. The cause is noble and
just. Military objectives are achievable and clear. In the haunting
words of terrorist victim Todd Beamer, "Let's roll."</TE>

less guilty of in high school or college or both.</LD>
<LD>   Still, we knew the gravity of the offense and paid for it
accordingly. It was drummed into us as the cardinal sin.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe that's why we shudder and gasp when we discover that some of
the revered and widely read historical texts of our day have
themselves been cribbed from somewhere else.</LD>
<TE>   In January, journalist Fred Barnes excoriated beloved popular
historian Stephen Ambrose for using unattributed passages from Thomas
Childers' book "The Wings of Morning" in his best-selling "The Wild
Blue."</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Ambrose admitted and apologized for copying
sentences and phrases from Childers' book but maintained that he had
done so inadvertently. Thereafter, the scandal mushroomed when
footnote chasers found plagiarized passages in other books by
Ambrose.</TE>
<TE>   A similar scandal has arisen around historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin, whose books--including the best-selling "No Ordinary Time,"
about FDR's presidency--catapulted her into a television career. She
had been appearing regularly as a commentator on shows like "The News
Hour With Jim Lehrer" and "NBC Nightly News."</TE>
<TE>   But now Goodwin is faced with accusations of having copied
passages from at least three other books in her 1987 "The Fitzgeralds
and the Kennedys." Last week, she admitted using a good deal of
unattributed material.</TE>
<TE>   If you count the case of another best-selling, Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian--Joseph J. Ellis ("Founding Brothers: The
Revolutionary Generation")--who was caught last year lying to his
Mount Holyoke students about serving in Vietnam, you have what
amounts to a startling rash of mendacity in popular history and a
serious betrayal of public trust, not to mention an egregious breach
of intellectual copyright.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on?</TE>
<TE>   Though this doesn't explain Ellis' lapse, the NASCAR pace of
modern publishing may be a large part of what led Ambrose and Goodwin
to fudge.</TE>
<TE>   In the past two decades, almost all of the venerable old small
publishing houses have been absorbed by multimedia conglomerates like
Viacom and AOL Time Warner, which demand profitability.</TE>
<TE>   This means more bestsellers, since these often are the only books
that make an appreciable profit.</TE>
<TE>   It also means that once a publisher hits on a best-selling author,
the publisher wants to keep that author producing as fast as
possible. It's what pays the bills.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the reason for the kind of rushing and resultant
sloppiness that both Goodwin and Ambrose have blamed for their
oversights.</TE>
<TE>   There is some truth to the claim that trade publishing has become
a harried, assembly-line operation with its head on the block. Only
serial blockbusters can stay the ax man's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Thus many books have become as formulaic and shoddy as the flicks
that Hollywood churns out. Publishers and writers are desperate to
cash in on the latest craze, be it baseball, the founding fathers or
jihad. Their livelihoods depend on it.</TE>
<TE>   This may be one of the real tragedies of free market capitalism
gone awry. The quality of our intellectual life is declining in the
throes of profit and loss, and the proof is in the process.</TE>
<TE>   We should be saddened when the first and often only question a
publisher asks when he reads a manuscript is: Will it sell?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, none of this absolves Doris Kearns Goodwin or Stephen
Ambrose. But if their borrowing was indeed just hurried mistakes in
the factories that their studies have become, it's not hard to see
how it could have happened.</TE>

<HD>A Guy to Talk to--and Maybe Be Silent With</HD>

<LD>I think I would have liked Danny Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   I think I could have sat down with him in a quiet corner of the
Red Dog and had a drink with him and talked about ... well ...
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   There haven't been too many people in my life that I could talk
nothing with, if you know what I mean. Not cosmic events, but small
kinds of occurrences that blow into a room like puffs of smoke and
then vanish out a window.</LD>
<TE>   I think I could have laughed with Danny Pearl. From what I read
and heard of him, he had a quirky sense of humor, an ability to
understand fun when it was time for fun. He had the look of a guy who
could kick back and open up.</TE>
<TE>   And I think I could have sat in silence with Danny Pearl. That's
important, maybe even more important than being able to discuss
nothing with a guy, being comfortable enough with each other that you
can just sit there without talking and still be company.</TE>
<TE>   My old pal Belcher was like that. We drank together, talked
together and laughed like madmen together. For years we carpooled at
5 a.m. to the old Oakland Tribune, where we both worked, sometimes
not saying a word for the 45 minutes it took to get there. We could
ride in silence together.</TE>
<TE>   I think Danny Pearl could have been like the Belch, one of the
old-school kinds of reporters who understood the idiosyncrasies of
life, even as he clung to its values.</TE>
<TE>   Belcher died in 1987, alone with the cancer that ravaged him.
Danny Pearl died weeks ago, alone with the killers who took his life
for no good reason at all.</TE>
<TE>   Now I miss them both, one a good friend, the other a man I didn't
even know.</TE>
<TE>   I was thinking about Danny Pearl the other night as I watched the
closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics: all those flags of
different nations in one gigantic flow of color and all the athletes
from everywhere mingling together and hugging each other. And I began
wondering what Danny would have thought of it all.</TE>
<TE>   I have to admit I felt a kind of rush, not from the pageantry but
from the idea that nations aren't just nations but are people too.
And maybe the mingling of the individuals, the people, would cause
them to wonder at some future date why people were always shooting at
each other, always killing other people.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been one of the more serious conversations I'd have
had with Danny Pearl. I'd have told him how I felt, and probably he'd
have laughed a little and chided my efforts to try to reshape the
world.</TE>
<TE>   But then he'd have understood the idea of close associations, and
how difficult it would be to shoot someone you knew.</TE>
<TE>   I think I could have had heavy conversations with Danny Pearl as
well as light ones. Belcher and I were able to bring each other to
the edge of tears over, well, big things, like love and humanity and
the passage of time. I suspect, as I think back on it, that a lot of
the emotion may have grown in direct proportion to the number of
martinis we drank, but at least it was there to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   If Danny Pearl and I had been sitting there watching the closing
ceremonies of the Olympics and maybe having a drink or two, I'd have
asked him if he thought all of that would be worth dying for.</TE>
<TE>   All the pageantry and hoo-hah, all the music and the flags and the
hugging and the words, and before that little Sarah Hughes,
iridescent and beautiful in her youngness, soaring over the ice like
a bird in flight.</TE>
<TE>   "What about it, Danny?" I'd have said. "Would you give your life
for their right to skate and hug and talk and sing and be a giggly
teenage girl in that brief flash of triumph?"</TE>
<TE>   We'd have talked about it long after the Olympic torch had been
extinguished and the pageantry had turned to party and the news shows
had gone on to something else.</TE>
<TE>   I think the gist of Danny Pearl's response would have been that
it's too bad you had to die for anything at all, especially a big
carnival like the Olympics. But maybe what it was supposed to
represent, a kind of union of the world, would be worth giving your
life for, the idea that humanity is one and the world is small. The
idea of tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   And then we'd have gotten into all the other kinds of things that
were less gigantic and flamboyant than the Olympics that were also
worth dying for. Like a walk in the park. Or coffee with a friend. Or
being in love. Or seeing a movie. Or raising a child. Or demanding
respect. Or sleeping in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Or just being able to talk together, or laugh together or ride in
silence together, or cry together.</TE>
<TE>   I'd have liked Danny Pearl, because I'm sure that he valued the
freedom of being able to do the small things we hardly ever think of.
In a way, he died for them. He went down like a soldier, but one
whose weapon was words and whose goal was not conquest but the
information that leads to knowledge, and the knowledge that leads to
truth.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt about it. I'd have liked Danny Pearl.</TE>

<LD>Stacy Carr made a final adjustment to the map of seating arrangements
perched in a corner of the Beverly Hilton lobby Tuesday night. With a
move of a magnet, she changed the course of one guest's evening,
moving him from table 42 to 14.</LD>
<LD>   Part strategist, diplomat and entertainment historian, Carr
studied her work: seating 790 VIPs with fragile egos, creating what
would be the geography of the evening at Clive Davis' legendary
pre-Grammy party.</LD>
<LD>   At table 30 would be Marion and Barbara Davis, Jackie Collins,
Dick Clark, Les Moonves plus his unspecified guest. At 31, the host
would sit next to Danielle Steel and San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown. At 32, Ahmet Ertegun, Quincy Jones and Naomi Campbell. Here
was an obvious constellation: Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears.
At 48 would be Kid Rock and Pam Anderson, sharing their table with
Tobey Maguire.</LD>
<TE>   Rod Stewart would get the pleasure of Natalie Cole's company, and
vice versa. Burt Bacharach and Barry Manilow could swap anecdotes, as
could Dr. Dre and Wesley Snipes. Nearby, Chris Tucker and Chris Rock
could compare material.</TE>
<TE>   Seating, said Carr, who's created Davis' party coordinates for a
decade, "is like putting together a puzzle." "Truly," she added,
"there are no bad tables."</TE>
<TE>   The pre-dinner cocktail hour got under way.</TE>
<TE>   There was songwriter and socialite Denise Rich,  batting sparkly
blue eyelids, sipping a red drink.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Clive," she gushed. "He's family ....He's the first person
I call when I have problems."</TE>
<TE>   Word began to circulate--Clive is here, Mr. Davis has arrived--and
the crowd got impenetrable.</TE>
<TE>   Some sought refuge on the balcony, with a smoke or a cell phone.
There was Tim Curry with his Marlboro Reds. Ryan Adams, without
cigarettes, was bumming them. "It's a good scene," he joked. "The
kids are looking good."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Tony Bennett looked suave. "It gets a little lonely on
the road," he said, explaining why he was partying with his peers.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd parted for Tony Curtis and his Stetson, though not
everyone recognized the actor. "Who is that guy?" a young man asked
his blond companion, who set him straight.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a group of people, including Slash and Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, waited for an audience with Davis, who was wearing his
trademark tinted glasses and leaning in close to whisper in people's
ears. "The secret to a good party is to honor creativity," he
whispered. And of course make everyone feel special.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, guests circulated. Everyone paid homage at table 19
where Alicia Keys, the sensation of last year's party, was sitting. A
photographer gently pushed Snipes aside to shoot the Grammy-nominated
singer.</TE>
<TE>   Then, close to 10 p.m., guests took the seats assigned by Carr,
listening for the next Alicia, and putting Carr's "no bad tables"
maxim to the test.</TE>
<TE>   Tale of a Vanilla Sky</TE>
<TE>   As Cameron Crowe describes his first meeting with Paul McCartney,
he acquires the exuberance of a teenager. "I sort of walked next to
him through the hallway, here, down to the editing room," Crowe says
Monday afternoon in his Santa Monica office. "People kind of turned
and did the double, triple, quadruple take, not believing what they
were seeing. It was insane!"</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Crowe was hoping McCartney would write a song for his
film "Vanilla Sky." He showed McCartney 40 minutes of the film, then
visited him at his recording studio. The plan was for Crowe to follow
a car driven by McCartney's friends. "Here's the greatest part,"
Crowe says. "He said, 'If you get lost, just look for the yellow car.
The PT Cruiser. We call it the yellow submarine.'" Crowe then mimes
his reaction: a silent expression of disbelief, his mouth agape.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe listened to several songs but didn't hear the acoustic track
he wanted for his film. "I said, 'This is really great, but ... if
anything comes to you in the next few days and you feel like writing
a folk song, you know I would be honored,'" Crowe says. "And I'm
looking around the room and guys are looking at me like--" Crowe
furrows his brow--"'He's just played you his new stuff, man! And
you're telling him you want something new?'"</TE>
<TE>   His assertiveness paid off. Four days later, McCartney called to
say he'd written "Vanilla Sky," which earned him his first Oscar
nomination since the one he received for 1973's "Live and Let Die."</TE>
<TE>   Much later, McCartney called to make sure Crowe really liked the
song. McCartney told him he wouldn't have hard feelings if the answer
was no--he would just rename it "Manila Envelope."</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no," Crowe told him. "It's 'Vanilla Sky.' And that was
that. It's amazing."</TE>

<LD>A BURDEN OF FLOWERS</LD>
<LD>   By Natsuki Ikezawa</LD>
<LD>   Translated by Alfred Birnbaum</LD>
<TE>   Kodansha</TE>
<TE>   280 Pages, $22</TE>
<TE>   Tetsuro "Tez" Nishijima is a well-known Japanese artist who flits
around Asia, looking for connection and inspiration. His sister,
Kaoru, is a Paris-based film location coordinator who undergoes a
strange baptism that leaves her with no more sense of belonging than
before. Both have fled Japan, an island they feel is unable to hold
their restless spirits. With the exception of occasional visits home
to see their emotionally distant parents, these two disaffected
wanderers might have remained in separate orbits but for the tragedy
that brings them together in Natsuki Ikezawa's meditative novel, "A
Burden of Flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Tez has become addicted to heroin on one of his visits to
Thailand, seduced into trying the drug by Inge, a German accountant
and sometime art critic, who hints at the drug's ability to provide
new insights into Tez's craft. But he finds the drug ultimately
deceptive, deluding him into thinking he's creating a masterpiece
when he's painting with just water. Despite kicking the habit at a
Thai monastery and returning home to recuperate, Tez has been left
physically weakened and emotionally vulnerable. So when he is thrown
together with a second heroin-using European on a return trip to
Thailand, he has little ability to resist. Appalled at his own
weakness, he flees to Bali and begins a methadone regimen, only to be
seduced again by a shady street pusher, who entraps the unsuspecting
artist in a trafficking arrest that leads to trial.</TE>
<TE>   As straightforward and as reminiscent of "Midnight Express" as the
novel may sound, in the hands of Ikezawa, "A Burden of Flowers" has a
meandering quality and an internal tension that comes, in part, from
the fact that half of the narration--Tez's--is a stream of
consciousness, distorted by the artist's drug-induced perception of
himself from a distant, third-person vantage point. Here Ikezawa's
writing is affecting and effective in portraying a man who comes to a
slow realization of the prison where he's incarcerated and the
hopelessness of his situation: "First blinking yanks a brutal
ripcord--a landslide caves in from above, pressing down flat and
suffocating. Body a catalogue of pains, pinioned against the wall in
some impossible posture, butting into the next body over .... Why'd
you have to wake up? .... Quietly switch off the works and let the
body slowly rot--how much easier that would be."</TE>
<TE>   While Tez's recollections provide the reader with a patchwork
perspective of his past and present dilemmas, it is his younger
sister's interspersed narration that binds the novel together.
Arriving in Japan for one of her infrequent visits, she learns from
her mother about Tez's arrest and immediately sets off to Bali to
help him. For Kaoru, the first glimpse of her brother, squeezed in
among the other bodies "just like at a zoo," is overwhelming, but she
presses on, determined to find legal counsel in a country whose
police and prosecutors seem only too willing to advocate for a quick
death sentence for Tez.</TE>
<TE>   Through her persistence and contacts, Kaoru is able to enlist the
services of an elderly Japanese professor with ties to Indonesia who
arranges for a guide, attorney and interpreter for her brother. But
because Kaoru herself does not speak the language, she too is an
observer, which makes the novel's courtroom scenes as seen through
her eyes unaffecting and flat. Moreover, the revelation that brings
together the missing threads of the story is unnecessarily tangled.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in spite of the misleading publisher's hype, which tries to
position "A Burden of Flowers" as a thriller, this novel--based on a
true story--aspires to more than the typical genre novel. With its
allusions to the disconnected siblings and the exquisitely rendered
islands they explore, and the characterization of Japan as an island
apart from, indeed separate from the rest of Asia, one is reminded of
John Donne's cautionary lines, "No man is an island, entire of
itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."</TE>
<TE>   For ultimately it is the means by which these sojourners find
spiritual and temporal connections to themselves and the Asian
continent that gives "A Burden of Flowers" its resonance and power.
Perhaps Tez says it best, in a letter to Inge summarizing the
siblings' eventual transformation: "... a new destiny opens up and a
person chooses to walk that path. Happenstance comes in so many
different colours, tangles the strands, cuts them apart only to
string them back together. It meshes and twists, sends a shuttle
flying across the warps--and before you know it, a life is woven."</TE>

bloom. Just remember: Move them back into good light when they
finish, fertilize every month between now and September and water
often. To flower well they must have enough sun to turn leaves
slightly yellow. Collectors grow them under lath or 55% shade cloth.</LD>

Seriously</HD>

<AU>CAROLYN HAX</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolyn: I am seeing a person who just got out of a serious
relationship. Things seemed fine, but soon the guy told me that he
thinks he is not ready for a relationship with anyone right now. I
appreciated his honesty. But he keeps calling, and when we go out it
feels like we are still dating. I am confused because he is saying
one thing and acting very differently. Some friends say that I should
just give it more time, and others are handing me my running shoes. I
like him a lot and want to be his girlfriend, not his doormat.</LD>
<LD>   --READY TO RUN</LD>
<LD>   Um. I think you feel like you're still dating because you're still
dating.</LD>
<TE>   And I think any message is going to come across as mixed if you
keep turning over every hyphen and comma, looking for the message
you'd rather hear. He is ready to go on dates with a woman or women
he likes, including you. He's not ready to commit. Good for him for
knowing the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn: I've been dating a guy for about a year, and things are
great. Really nice, funny, interesting, blahblahblah. However, he is
also painfully socially awkward. And I emphasize painfully. He feels
shy, doesn't say anything, then overcompensates by making loud,
show-off comments. He's not like this at all once he relaxes. I'm
finding it difficult to take him places where I will need to
introduce him. Friends who meet him look at me like I'm nuts. First
of all, is this something that could change, or is this a
take-it-like-it-is thing? Secondly, am I a bad person for being
bothered by this?</TE>
<TE>   --NOWHERE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You're a very bad person. Terrible. Satan's publicist.</TE>
<TE>   So, how is it now--has his weirdness stopped getting to you? Of
course not. Things that bother us bother us, whether we're legitimate
victims or jerks; you've got to call a peeve a peeve. I'd like to
enjoy hitting traffic, but in the meantime Plan B is to curse more
and/or drive less.</TE>
<TE>   That said, being honest with ourselves about why we get so annoyed
can help us feel less so; traffic is far less obnoxious if you stop
leaving late all the time. So what is it here? Do you dislike this
side of him, regard it as a character flaw? Do you miss socializing
in groups? Do you feel ashamed to have friends think the guy you're
with is a loser and that he was the best you could do?</TE>
<TE>   Respond to any of these with a conscious decision--that you'll be
open-minded and patient, or that his good traits outweigh this
badness, or that your vanity should be reined in, whichever might
apply, and you might find he isn't so bad.</TE>
<TE>   And that, in turn, might put you at ease introducing him, which
then might could possibly just maybe help the poor guy to relax. It's
wise to assume that he won't change, not much, not unless he's so
young he'll outgrow it. Try introducing him slowly; he may loosen
around your friends like he did with you, one-on-one--if you (and
they) will let him, and he doesn't feel you cringe.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing bad about waiting, at least a little while, to see
how the maybes add up. Just don't wait because it seems right or
wrong, though; out of fairness to him, do it only if you feel he's
worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn: I have been living with my boyfriend for two years.
Today, at work, I received an anonymous letter telling me that my
boyfriend had cheated on me twice. It was stated in this letter that
it was being written because I am "too nice not to know what is going
on." I have confronted my boyfriend, and he denies all of it. What do
I do now? Please help.</TE>
<TE>   --WHY ME</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why-me's are always sighed away rhetorically, but they're really
best when they're answered. Really. Why you? You've exhausted the
whole things-to-do list (1. Confront boyfriend.), so you might as
well mull this one over.</TE>
<TE>   The two possibilities are that he's cheating or isn't. That means
you're either missing something at home or missing that there's a
sniper out there in the friend-hedges. A vindictive ex, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   Given your personality, and his, and yours combined, and your
history--has he ever, ever deceived you?--and your various social
circles, and the time you've been together, and the limits of
credulity, which of these two scenarios makes more sense? If this is
like most inner issues, the answer is right in your face--or will be,
when the head bag comes off.</TE>
<TE>   There are always exceptions, though, and so the questions become:
Can you take the wait-and-see, innocent-until-proven-guilty
approach--relax, live, love and keep your eyes wide open--without
going completely out of your mind? And have you been tested for new
STDs?</TE>

<HD>How to Send Them Packing</HD>
<DH>Some larger plants you can move yourself. And if you're
lucky, they're worth something.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was moving day a few weeks back in the Smaus garden. As part of my
backyard remodel, I decided to rearrange some fairly big plants, as
if they were living room furniture. These plants were clearly growing
in the wrong spots--in too much shade, or sun, or where they would
soon block paths or views from windows. Moving fairly big plants is
doable, though a little more involved and a lot more strenuous than
dragging the sofa to a different location.</LD>
<LD>   This is something that should be done in winter, between late
November and February, while plants are dormant or barely growing. At
other times of the year it is difficult to impossible to move
good-sized plants, at least without professional help.</LD>
<LD>   People often ask me if I know of a nursery that will dig up plants
and pay for the privilege of carting them away. The answer is no,
because most plants are far too common or difficult to move, so
nurseries are almost never interested.</LD>
<TE>   Still, I happen to know that a dogwood in my yard is not a common
tree, so I called a nursery and asked if they wanted to buy a
slightly used 'Cloud Nine' dogwood, a variety that does reasonably
well in California. This special variety of an East Coast native
makes a handsome smallish, deciduous tree that covers itself in early
spring with big white flowers (which are actually flower-like
bracts).</TE>
<TE>   I had rather foolishly planted one too close to a new addition a
few years back. I had been desperate to hide all the new stucco, but
now I knew the dogwood had to go. If I left it there any longer, its
branches would rip at the shingles on the roof during winds and the
trunk would be pushing against the wall. It had already dented a
gutter during one good blow.</TE>
<TE>   I really searched our rather small yard for a place to put it but
could find none, so I worked out a deal with Burkard Nursery in
Pasadena--where I had originally bought the tree--for some store
credit in exchange for the dogwood, which I dug up myself. It was
fairly easy to remove because it wasn't that old and is one tree
known to have shallow roots.</TE>
<TE>   I dug around and under the dogwood and then rocked it loose. One
of my sons who was visiting helped me hoist it out of the ground (he
expects things like this on his visits). The root ball was about 3
feet across and a foot deep, really small for a tree, but heavy. We
put it on some burlap and tightly bound the root ball in burlap and
rope.</TE>
<TE>   The nursery guys came by a few days later to pick it up, and when
I told a friend that I had actually sold my dogwood, she looked
astonished and said that maybe I had found a second career selling
"certified pre-owned trees." Too bad not all trees are so easy to dig
up or sell.</TE>
<TE>   I dug up and moved other plants, including a big camellia, nearly
5 feet tall, that had been growing for about four years in front of a
window. Several weeks later it looks just fine in its new spot
against a blank wall. I could have simply cut down the old and
planted new, but I really couldn't get rid of this camellia, since it
has the same name as my daughter, Ramona, and it is a pink variety
that is no longer easily found.</TE>
<TE>   Camellias are also shallow-rooted, which is why they are easy to
dig and move, at least while they are young. I dug around this one
with a spade, making a circle about 2 1/2 feet across, then leaned
back on the spade and popped the root ball out of the ground. The
soil was still damp (not soggy) from recent rains, so it was perfect
for digging in, and the camellia came out with only a little effort
because the roots went less than a foot deep.</TE>
<TE>   I also dug up some giant clumps of clivia. These I moved to the
very shady spot where the camellia had been. Clivias can grow in very
deep shade, even a cave, according to one garden pundit. And they're
short enough to not block the window, ever.</TE>
<TE>   The clivias had a few surprisingly deep roots, which might explain
why they can get by with so little water. The center of each clump
seemed to have one extra-fat tap root that went down farther than I
could dig, so I just sliced it with the spade, the reason one keeps
the leading edge of a spade sharpened. Most of the roots, however,
were quite shallow and easy to pull up.</TE>
<TE>   With a spading fork, I split the big clumps apart, plunging the
fork into the root mass and wiggling it back and forth until the
roots separated and I had several clumps. I lugged these over to
where the camellia had been.</TE>
<TE>   Next, I dug up some overgrown clumps of a nice medium-sized
agapanthus. I divided and replanted some of these but also tossed
tons out, since I had found some really nifty plants of a variegated
kind at the nursery, which were sure to look a lot more interesting
in this slightly shaded corner of the garden. And I dug up several
roses and moved them to sunnier spots in the garden. Roses are
ridiculously easy to move while they are dormant in the middle of
winter.</TE>
<TE>   With the plants rearranged, I used the store credit to acquire
529 pounds of New York cobblestones. According to the building
materials supplier, these roughly rectangular chunks of granite had
once paved the streets of old New York City. Similar cobblestones are
occasionally seen under the asphalt of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In my backyard I am going to use the old cobbles to pave small
sections of a spanking-new patio. Most of the patio I have planned
for the backyard will be covered with the same plain concrete
stepping stones we've used elsewhere in the garden, so the rough
granite will introduce occasional spots of texture into the smooth
expanses of concrete. Right now the cobblestones are stacked against
a wall. Admiring my modest pile, I can't help thinking that swapping
a young tree--that now waits at the nursery with a $275 price tag for
a new owner--for a 500-pound-plus stack of old cobblestones was a
pretty good deal. Maybe I am onto something here.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever wondered where authors and illustrators get their ideas
for stories? They find them in the newspaper, in things they did as
kids, in watching a dog and cat interact, and they think, "What if
... ?" Ideas are everywhere. They're all around you, too.</LD>
<LD>   An author starts with an idea and writes a first draft--which
might be really messy. Then the author rewrites the story, thinks
some more and rewrites it again, just as you do. Most authors revise
their work 10 to 50 times before they get it the way they want it.
And illustrators erase, throw away and try again before their
drawings are the best they can be.</LD>
<LD>   Did you know?</LD>
<TE>   * It takes one to three years for a story to become a book after
the author finishes it.</TE>
<TE>   * Authors usually never meet the illustrators for their books.</TE>
<TE>   * Most picture books have exactly 32 pages.</TE>
<TE>   Well, now you know, and here's how to learn even more. March 3-9
is Children's Authors &amp; Illustrators Week. You can meet authors and
illustrators from the Children's Authors Network this Sunday at the
Richard J. Riordan Central Library, 630 W. 5th St. in downtown Los
Angeles from 2 to 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   More information about children's authors and illustrators can be
found at the Children's Authors Network, childrensauthorsnetwork
.com, and the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators,

<DH>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, muralist keeps ties to Saudi
patrons in perspective.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON, D.C.</DL>
<LD>Securing the financial freedom to paint is an age-old piece of the
artist's life palette. For Washington artist Gary Goldberg, the
freedom to produce critically acclaimed paintings has come from a
thriving decorative business--murals and trompe l'oeil designs for
homes and office buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Besides a steady income stream, Goldberg's business produces
entertaining anecdotes about the unique and sometimes fickle demands
of his clients--like the Virginia restaurant customers who objected
to the full-frontal nudity of the figures in an 80-by-6-foot pastoral
mural. (Goldberg and the art professor who hired him to assist on the
project were dispatched to paint palm fronds over the offending body
parts.)</LD>
<LD>   In the months since Sept. 11, however, politics have entered the
equation because the patrons of Goldberg's largest and most
impressive murals are members of Saudi Arabia's royal family. "Before
9/11 it seemed like a wonderful bridge to a different culture,"
Goldberg says. "Now people squint when they ask where a mural is
going.... I guess I should be doing work for an honorable U.S.
company like Enron," the 45-year-old artist wryly adds.</LD>
<TE>   The kingdom, in which a small and enormously wealthy elite holds
economic and political power, has been blamed for the rise of
militant young men susceptible to the calls of terrorist leaders.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were Saudis, and the
Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, repeatedly cites the
presence of U.S. troops in his birth country as a key motive behind
his deadly plans.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's $80 billion in annual oil revenues helps finance
opulent lifestyles for a royal family of about 7,000 princes and
their families. While many of the Saudi royals pride themselves on
their U.S. educations and cosmopolitan manners abroad, fundamentalist
Islamic practices prevail within the kingdom's borders, and anger at
Israel manifests itself in anti-Semitic rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, Goldberg solicited his rabbi's opinion on
sending his work to the Saudis' palaces. "He thought it was
interesting; he wasn't at all offended," Goldberg says. Citing a
recent concert tour of two pianists--one Israeli, one
Palestinian--Goldberg notes, "Art is a wonderful way to bridge
differences."</TE>
<TE>   Those who question his work, he adds, should focus on the U.S.
military alliance and reliance on Saudi oil--not the production of
art for Saudi princes. "There are thousands of Americans over there
pumping oil out of the ground," he says during an interview in his
downtown Washington studio. "Prince Bandar [a Goldberg client] is a
pilot trained by the U.S. military. U.S. companies sell American
information and weapons systems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing paintings for private residences. I have a sense of
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Goldberg's primary challenge with his Saudi clients was
artistic. While he describes his clients as "people with Western
mores and ideals," he still must meet the demands of an Islamic
culture that prohibits the portrayal of human figures or animals.
That wasn't too much of an issue when the wife of the kingdom's
then-finance minister decided she wanted to rip out the marble on a
bathroom wall to make room for Goldberg's vision of an Italianate
garden. But it became a big problem when another Saudi client
requested a wall-size painting for a palace health club.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted a sports mural," Goldberg recalls. "How do you do a
sports mural without people? It seemed impossible, so I did a
semi-abstract, almost Cubist painting."</TE>
<TE>   The mural features a soccer field arched like a bridge over a
city, with unmanned yachts racing under the bridge. A giant oval
carries race cars--Formula One speedsters with covers that hide the
drivers. His agent, Larry Horn, describes the final work as
Dali-esque. Goldberg did take one risk with the sports
mural--painting riderless racehorses on a track. His client didn't
object.</TE>
<TE>   Horn, owner of Horn International Design, caters to a broad range
of international art clients. He says Goldberg's murals are popular
with the Saudis because "they have such big residences. Their whole
life is centered around the home. Weddings, dinners, events we would
have elsewhere, take place inside the home."</TE>
<TE>   While American patrons derive social status from rubbing elbows
with their favorite painters and sculptors, the Saudi royals view
artists as little more than the hired help. Goldberg has never been
to Saudi Arabia, and his contact with his patrons consists of
handshakes and a few words. Horn acts as his agent and negotiates the
deals while Goldberg paints his murals, section by section, inside
his Washington studio. From there, the panels are packaged and
shipped overseas for installation.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's latest project, for the Lebanese residence of a
businessman and Saudi prince, promises to be his most elaborate yet.
Portraying the ruins of the Pharos lighthouse at Alexandria--one of
the Seven Wonders of the ancient world--the 43-foot-long mural starts
with tropical colors and bright marine tones, deepening panel by
panel into rich indigos, as if the viewer were sinking farther and
farther toward the ocean floor. Horn originally proposed the idea
after reading a magazine article about an archeological scuba
expedition off the coast of Egypt to locate the lighthouse ruins.</TE>
<TE>   Each panel, nearly 8 feet high, will be separated by a stained
glass design inspired by the American Arts and Crafts movement.
Goldberg will paint the panels inside his Washington studio with the
help of two assistants. After they are shipped to Lebanon, the
translucent panels will be installed several inches off the wall and
illuminated with back lights.</TE>
<TE>   Like his American clients, the Saudis sometimes make inconvenient
demands. Prince H.H. Faisal, a former minister of education, wanted a
mural based on two colors--red and gold--to match a dining room
chandelier in his Rijadh palace complex. Goldberg added a touch of
green and produced a realistic recreation of a Pompeian fresco, based
on archeological fragments, in sienna tones. "So many artists are so
temperamental," says Horn. "Gary is very creative and at the same
time receptive."</TE>
<TE>   Muralist William Woodward, a George Washington University
professor who founded the campus' painting department, described
Goldberg--a former student--as an "original and independent thinker."
Woodward rejects any description of Goldberg's murals as merely
decorative.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, he says, "is one of the few painters who believes that
ornamentation has a function. It gives the spirit a place to dwell.
He's in the tradition of the artist who still cherishes and believes
in these humanistic qualities."</TE>
<TE>   Still, whether he's painting for Saudis in the Middle East or
Americans in the northeast, Goldberg's murals--which can cost as much
as $60,000--pay the bills so he can work on what his friends call
"Gary's real art." Goldberg runs a cooperative art studio from the
second floor of a nondescript building in an industrial neighborhood,
where a dozen artists divide up the space for their studios.</TE>
<TE>   He wears faded jeans and listens to free-form jazz. His wooden
easel stands next to a window overlooking railroad tracks in the
foreground and the national Catholic cathedral in the background. His
paintings are stacked facing the wall. Sometimes he completes one
painting at a time, but just as often he works on three or four
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, most of his fine art paintings are still-lifes, but
they are much more. As a child, he was intrigued by Rube Goldberg
contraptions. "Maybe it was because he had the same name," he says.
"But I used to draw these complex machines for doing a really simple
task--where you would press a button, which would cause a ball to
roll off, which would hit something on a seesaw, causing it to flip
up in the air, which would start a fan going; the fan would blow air,
which would cause a boat to move. And all of this is simply to turn
off an alarm."</TE>
<TE>   Those Rube Goldberg themes are still evident in his fine art, in
which he says he wants to "bring that spirit in, not so much as an
honor to Goldberg, but more like a treatise on how things work. The
mind is always straining to figure out how things go together, and to
puzzle them together."</TE>
<TE>   In his current work, he adds techniques learned from his
decorative business doing trompe l'oeil--which translates as "trick
the eye." The contraptions in his paintings have precise surfaces,
but with warps and bends and multiple images underneath, making them
almost addictive to look at. In one painting, he adds to his
contraption the image of a gourd flying through the air--about to hit
a glass table, which he describes with the Italian word dietrologia,
an unseen but nefarious hand guiding events.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary has a sort of Zen-like reverence for the ordinary object,"
says David Stainback, owner of Artists' Museum, a Washington gallery.
"He uses them for allegorical meanings. Even though something may
appear a still-life, there is always so much more underneath. People
with discerning eyes can really see into his work.</TE>
<TE>   Stainback adds that the artist is also a "master colorist who uses
all the essentials of design."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, who grew up in a Washington suburb, first decided he
wanted to pursue the dicey career route of professional artist when
he spent a summer semester in France, painting en plein-air as he and
other college students retraced the steps of the great impressionists
along the coast of Brittany.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it sounds really romantic, it's helpful to see that if
you want to be an artist, you wake up and paint, and then paint again
in the afternoon, and then you critique in the evening if there's no
light left. And you do that day after day after day," Goldberg
recalls. "And you realize some people loved being in Brittany and
loved being in France and loved the food and would paint every third
day. But some people painted every day and knew they wanted to be
artists. That experience really convinced me I wanted to be an
artist."</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining a degree in fine arts from George Washington
University, he apprenticed with Woodward on an attention-getting
mural inside Clyde's Restaurant at Tyson's Corner, considered one of
the area's hot restaurants in the late 1970s and early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   He also gained early renown as a Washington artist. When one of
his professors hooked him up with the Georgetown Gallery, he was
given a solo exhibition, selling nearly all of the two dozen
landscapes he showed. By the mid-1980s, he was showing with Franz
Bader Gallery and selling to such D.C. luminaries as Washington Post
publisher Donald Graham, CNN's Bernard Shaw and columnist Joseph
Kraft. In 1989, a Washington Post critic raved that Goldberg's
still-lifes "provoke awe." Later, he showed at the Forum Gallery in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg started his decorative business in 1990 after determining
that even with his success--at the time he was selling paintings at
the Washington market's top rates of $3,000 to $4,000 apiece--he
couldn't make a living and support a family. Artists here tend to
make their living teaching, working in the city's network of museums
or even running a family business. Goldberg decided to turn his
talents toward home design.</TE>
<TE>   The Bader gallery hooked him up with a decorator's show, and his
business began to thrive. Soon he was doing work for Washington's
large diplomatic community, which is how he came to the attention of
Saudi clients.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi murals are his largest pieces, and Goldberg continues to
feature them in his brochure, alongside work for American clients,
such as an 18-by-35-foot sky ceiling with more than 60 gold-leafed
Byzantine stars. (The ceiling was inspired by a 15th century Italian
fresco.)</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there are circumstances [such as open conflict between
the U.S. and Saudi Arabia] where I wouldn't work for the Saudis,"
Goldberg says. But for now, at least, he intends to continue painting
for his Saudi clients--and to defend his decision to produce palace
art.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about art," he says. "When I start selling weapons
systems, you can call me back."</TE>

<HD>Art Restorers Help Antiques That Haven't Aged Gracefully</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's antiques owner--whether of museum-quality works, beloved
heirlooms or mere swap-meet finds--tends to be savvier about value
than ever before, thanks in large part to the popularity of public
television's "Antiques Roadshow." But questions still remain: What to
do if a piece of porcelain is cracked or an antique table acquires
water spots? Should a missing part be replaced? How visible should
repair work be? And, perhaps most important, how much will the new
work affect the object's monetary value?</LD>
<LD>   It all boils down to the essential differences between
conservation and restoration.</LD>
<LD>   According to Victoria Blyth-Hill, director of LACMA's Conservation
Center, "Conservation as a field is holistic and encompasses
restoration as well as examination, documentation, preventative care
and treatment and is supported by research. With us, less is more. We
stabilize the object and present it in its original state as much as
possible." Blyth-Hill says that the golden rule of conservation is
reversibility. "Trends in conservation change, so 50 years from now
someone may want to do something different with the object."</LD>
<TE>   Restoration, on the other hand, is the actual treatment process.
"Restoration is older and has been going on in Europe for hundreds of
years. Conservation is a much more modern, evolving field,"
Blyth-Hill says.</TE>
<TE>   Although both areas have their own codes of ethics, it's still
important for an owner of antiques to make an educated decision on
which way to go. Generally, if an article is of great value,
conservation is indicated. However, if the value is mainly
sentimental or if the object is functional--say, a clock or
vase--restoration can be a suitable choice. "A lot depends on how
important the object is to you and how much you're willing to spend,"
Blyth-Hill continues.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, restoration is a very complex and personal issue,"
says Jason Stein, decorative arts specialist at Christie's Los
Angeles. "Some prefer untouched pieces, while others appreciate the
merits of restoration. And there is no straightforward answer on how
it affects prices at auction. That can only be judged on a
piece-by-piece basis. Factors to consider are the quality of
restoration, the impact of it on the piece, the number of times it's
been repaired and when it was done. If it was done 200 years ago, it
is now an integral part of it. For an auction house, the ideal thing
is an unrestored piece, because then the collector can decide."</TE>
<TE>   If a figurine or vase is in many pieces or if the value is mainly
sentimental, restoration can be a reasonable choice. Several
restoration companies exist in the Los Angeles area. Before you
choose one, it's best to examine examples of their work, visit their
workshops and get a written estimate of repairs and the length of
time needed for the job. References are also important. If personal
recommendations are not available, you can consult the conservation
departments of Christie's, Sotheby's, LACMA or the Getty Museum.</TE>
<TE>   One Los Angeles firm is Golberg Restoration, owned by Rafail and
Polina Golberg. Their workshop, which they encourage customers to
visit, is jammed full of disparate objects and resembles a dusty
attic. On one side of the room are small, delicate porcelain figures,
some missing hands and flowers, while at the opposite side a
12-panel, 9-foot-tall Chinese Coromandel screen leans against a wall,
ready for the final restoration touches to its black lacquer. Waiting
for repairs are a large Italian glass vase with a broken stem, a
life-sized 1920s French mannequin without arms and a dining room
table that was singed by a candle. "We will keep the original patina
of the table and just work on the burn marks," says Polina Golberg.</TE>
<TE>   "This girl had no head," continues Polina, pointing to a Dresden
porcelain compote held aloft by two female figurines dancing around a
maypole. "We made a head from porcelain and added new flowers too."
Polina's work desk has little cups of paint that she carefully mixes
to re-create the original colors on centuries-old works. Repairing
porcelain is the bulk of their business, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "All our repairs can be reversed, so that years later things can
be recleaned or redone if necessary. And they're invisible to the
naked eye because we duplicated the original paint and finish,"
Polina says. Invisible repairs are important to both collectors and
museums, although any repairs will appear under ultraviolet light if
there is a question about them.</TE>
<TE>   The Golbergs have worked in California for 14 years, arriving in
1988 from Odessa, Russia, where both worked as restorers. Polina has
a background in fine arts and studied at the Hermitage Museum in St.
Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Rafail trained in engineering and fine arts and worked for the
Odessa branch of a Moscow restorations research center. "We moved to
San Francisco first and spent six months in an art conservation
library studying. We had to change some of the ways we did things,
because here there is a more advanced technology. We moved to Los
Angeles eight years ago," says Rafail.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the restoration work the Golbergs do is for individuals
who want a piece fixed for sentimental or functional reasons. Golberg
Restoration is located at 411 Westmount Drive, Los Angeles; (310)
652-0735, www.restorationworld .com. Other local restoration firms
include Brooks Restoration (porcelain), LG Antique Restoration
(furniture), Griswold Conservation Associates (furniture/objects) and
Pashgian Brothers (rugs). For general information, visit the Web site

<DH>Part 4 The story so far: Ted Geisel has become the
cartoonist for Flit bug killer.</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Ted and Helen could live well on his income from creating
Flit cartoons, Ted wanted to do other things. He wrote an ABC book
with silly words. For the letter Z, for example, he wrote: "What
begins with Z? I do. I am a Zizzer-Zazzer-Zuzz as you can plainly
see." No publisher wanted it at first. In 1936, during a storm on
board a ship to Europe, the rhythm of the engines attracted him. He
tried to think up words to match the beat. He came up with "And to
Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," about a boy's walk home from
school.</LD>
<LD>   The book was rejected more than 20 times before Vanguard Press
bought it. It quickly sold 10,000 copies at $1 each. Since then, many
millions more have been sold. Encouraged by reviews of "Mulberry
Street," Ted began thinking of another children's book. An idea came
to him on a train one morning. He wondered about the hat on the man
seated in front of him. What if he threw the hat out the window?
"He'd probably just grow another one and ignore me," he thought. From
this musing came "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins."</LD>
<LD>   Next he sold "The King's Stilts" and "Horton Hatches the Egg."
Children and adults began looking forward to each book.</LD>
<TE>   During World War II Ted wanted to help the war effort. He and
Helen moved to Hollywood, where he worked for movie director Frank

won awards, including an Academy Award for "Hitler Lives" and another

<TE>   In 1948 Ted and Helen bought a tower high up on a hill in La Jolla
and built rooms around it. Ted set up his office in the upper tower
space and worked there eight hours a day, seven days a week--or even
longer if ideas flowed. If ideas didn't flow, he'd lie on the floor
and stare at the ceiling, or pace the floor. Helen became his editor
and business manager while also writing children's books.</TE>

<HD>Buzzword Is Losing Its Essential Qualities</HD>
<DH>Culture* From soap and computers to political statements
and business practices, the overused term 'transparent' just isn't
clear anymore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the old days, transparency was simple. Glass was transparent and
motives were transparent. Photographic negatives were transparent and
so were modish raincoats--the kind you could imagine Twiggy in,
sashaying around swinging London.</LD>
<LD>   Transparency was a window onto what was previously hidden, and the
more you saw, the more you understood, or thought you understood.
Seeing, as they say, was believing, and seeing through something was
the ultimate expression of power and enlightenment, like Superman
with his X-ray eyes.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea of seeking transparency and the ability to see through
illusions is the central idea of philosophy and science. That's true
of the Eastern tradition and the Western tradition," says Ken Sanes,
a former editorial writer for the Palm Beach Post who operates
www.transpa rencynow.com, an Internet Web site "devoted to making
things clearer."</LD>
<TE>   But now transparency is becoming complex and evasive, even as its
linguistic stock soars. On Capitol Hill, legislators are calling for
more "transparency" in corporate America following the Enron debacle,
in which company executives allegedly played hide-and-seek with other
people's money. President Bush recently declared that the United
States "cannot allow nations that aren't transparent," i.e. brutal
dictatorships, to join forces with terrorist groups. A few weeks ago,
a spokeswoman for India's Foreign Ministry, downplaying a recent
short-range missile test that could have threatened Pakistan,
insisted that "the test was undertaken in a predictable and
transparent manner." And the International Olympic Committee has
vowed to be more "transparent" in its affairs after a series of
scandals on and off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   This raises some obvious questions: Why "transparent" instead of
an old-fashioned, forthright adjective such as "honest" or "open"?
What meanings may lie beneath transparency's smooth, euphemistic
surface? And why is transparent so visible these days?</TE>
<TE>   It could be that, to anyone with his or her eyes open, concepts
such as "honesty," "openness" and even "reality" have become rather
opaque lately. "Transparent" captures the sense of ambiguity that
pervades postmodern life--the uneasy feeling that, when we try to
perceive the world around us or sift facts from virtual simulations,
there's no solid there there anymore. Even the world's most wanted
man, Osama bin Laden, has somehow managed to temporarily slip out of
view, despite the presence of hundreds of electronic camera eyes,
satellites and infra-red scopes trying desperately to spot him.
"Transparent" may inadvertently express the uneasy, very contemporary
feeling that the harder we stare at things, the less we see.</TE>
<TE>   Transparency's unsettling faddishness isn't confined to politics,
business and sports. It has infiltrated food, fashion, design and
architecture, as both metaphor and motif. Classic iMac computers are
transparent, and Nepalese "ping" noodles are transparent. Odorless,
overpriced soap is transparent, and the new Prada boutique in
Manhattan, designed by the visibly talented Dutch architect Rem
Koolhaas, contains changing rooms with transparent glass facades that
can be made dark or peekaboo at the flick of a button.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there's a movement afoot to make public
spaces--airports, basketball arenas, government buildings--more
transparent, using security cameras and other high-tech surveillance
to catch terrorists and "evildoers," some of whom may be hiding among
us in plain sight.</TE>
<TE>   The use of "transparent" and "transparency" also may reflect
anxiety over issues such as Internet privacy, the security (or lack
thereof) of "wireless technology," the spread of "identity theft" and
the questionable reliability of information during wartime.
"Transparent" carries a variety of encoded meanings in a society
where self-display and exhibitionism are commonplace. Some think
America is becoming a nation not of visionaries but voyeurs, whose
tastes and modes of perception are being modeled after a Victoria's
Secret catalog. After all, when Henry David Thoreau wrote, "A man
must see before he can say," he probably was referring to spiritual
learning, not lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   For some time, it's been all too apparent that "transparent" is a
slippery term, a looking-glass word with a dual personality. Most of
the time it denotes frankness, honesty, accountability--clearly what
President Bush meant in his recent remarks about rogue states. But it
can signal ugly deceptions masquerading as truth. To say that
someone's motives are "transparent" is basically to call him or her a
lousy liar.</TE>
<TE>   Especially in visually sophisticated societies such as the United
States, the idea of transparency is being undercut by the recognition
that images distort, photographs can be digitally tweaked and reality
can be virtually constructed out of pixels. The action of seeing, of
sight itself, has been both enhanced and, some argue, undermined by
the proliferation of new visual technologies--everything from
high-powered telescopes and Hollywood special effects to
camera-assisted surgery equipment--that allow us to see in
spectacular new ways but make us distrust our own eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "All the common linguistic tropes we use--'seeing is believing,'
'transparency'--that we use to express truth have been destabilized
very much [over] the last decade," says Nicholas Mirzoeff, a
professor in the art department at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook and editor of "The Visual Culture Reader" (Routledge,
1998).</TE>
<TE>   We now know that powerful people and institutions can veil their
machinations with doctored photos, trumped-up accounting figures,
falsified body counts. That perception could make it hard for today's
leaders to reassure the public by pledging that their future actions
will be more "transparent." "People are used to seeing in the rest of
our everyday lives how fluid and manipulable things are," Mirzoeff
says. "Images can be manipulated by people using the simplest
point-and-click technology. So the metaphor [of transparency] ceases
to be convincing."</TE>
<TE>   These days there's reason to think that all visually related
figures of speech should be treated as suspect until proven innocent.
According to published remarks, some Enron executives were fond of
referring to the "optics" and the "cosmetics" of a deal, i.e. the
appearance, not the reality, of its chances for success. Before its
collapse, how Enron looked to outsiders was considered more important
than how it actually performed. Enron appears to have been the Dorian
Gray of corporations, turning a handsome profile to Wall Street while
its alter-ego's visage rotted away in the attic.</TE>
<TE>   In the multilayered world of our contemporary lives, where we see
ourselves endlessly reflected in ATM screens, home videos, the
Staples Center scoreboard, the challenge is knowing how to remove the
veils so we can see when lies are being told, account books are being
cooked and the emperor has no clothes. Science-fiction author David
Brin ("The Postman") argues in his nonfiction book "The Transparent
Society: Freedom Versus Privacy in a City of Glass Houses" that the
best way to secure a truly see-through America is to make sure that
the citizenry, in effect, has the same access to X-ray specs as the
powers that be.</TE>
<TE>   "In all of human history, no government ever knew as much about
its people as our government does, and no people in history has ever
been so free," says Brin, speaking by phone from his home in Southern
California. "What do you do with a paradox like that?"</TE>
<TE>   You can shrug it off, Brin argues, or you can turn it into an
asset. "Having a government that sees better is not unreasonable," he
says. "What's reasonable is stripping it naked. And that holds for
the private sector as well. Because human beings will do what human
beings do: Given some power, they will try to conceal and protect
their interests. Given a choice between accountability and privacy,
we can reliably be expected to choose one for ourselves and the other
for everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Transparently, he's right.</TE>

<LD>In a remarkably tight sales race that saw the top three albums
separated by fewer than 5,600 copies, Jennifer Lopez's remix
collection has recaptured the No. 1 spot on the nation's album sales
chart.</LD>
<LD>   The singer-actress' "J to tha L-0!: The Remixes" sold 101,557
copies last week.</LD>
<LD>   In doing so, it edged out Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory," which
sold 96,377 copies, and Alan Jackson's "Drive," which sold 96,043
copies, according to SoundScan.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez's album, which offers revamped versions of songs from her
"J-Lo" collection, entered the charts at No. 1 two weeks ago but fell
to third place last week behind Jackson and Creed.</TE>
<TE>   The odd thing about Linkin Park's album is that it has sold more
than 6.3 million copies since its release early last year but has
never reached No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The highest new entry on the chart is gospel star Kirk Franklin's
"Rebirth of Kirk Franklin," which is No. 4 after selling 91,000
copies last week.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the album Top 10 are held, in order, by
Ludacris, Creed, Nickelback, Pink, Britney Spears and Puddle of Mudd.</TE>
<TE>   Alanis Morissette's "Under Rug Swept," released Tuesday, shows
signs of being a contender for the No. 1 spot on next week's chart.
Morissette's last album, ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,'' sold
470,000 in its first week in 1998. Mr. Cheeks' "Lights, Camera,
Action!" is the new No. 1 single.</TE>

<TE>   Director Mira Nair returns to her native country and the site of
her popular 1988 film "Salaam Bombay!" with "Monsoon Wedding," a
delightful romantic comedy revolving around a wedding in a modern
upper-middle-class family in New Delhi. Despite embracing a
contemporary lifestyle, the parents have arranged for their daughter
to marry a man she barely knows, an Indian living in Texas. And the
bride-to-be has cold feet about the festivities because she has long
been having a secret affair with a married TV producer. As relatives
from both sides of the family gather for the wedding during the
monsoon season, the young woman must decide if she should tell her
husband-to-be about her lover.</TE>
<TE>   "Monsoon Wedding," rated R for language, including some
sex-related dialogue, opens exclusively at the Regent Theater in

<TE>   "I am a woman who is unfaithful to a million men," Greta Garbo
once said of her screen appearances. For the next four weeks at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, she can be unfaithful to thousands
more. The four-week festival "Garbo Rules" celebrates the legendary
Swedish actress who took America by storm in 1925 in "The Torrent"
and continued to mesmerize audiences until she quit films in 1941 and
retired from public life. Her films, though, have never retired.
Nominated for Oscars for "Anna Christie," "Romance," "Camille" and
"Ninotchka," she received a special Academy Award in 1954 for her
work. On tap for Friday are the 1933 romance "Queen Christina," which
features her former lover, John Gilbert, and 1931's "Mata Hari."
Scheduled for Saturday is 1932's "Grand Hotel," a best picture Oscar
winner, and 1931's "Susan Lenox, Her Fall and Rise," the pre-Hayes
Code melodrama that was the only film she made with Clark Gable.</TE>

he surprises you, so expect what the New York Times called "a new and
vibrant dimension" when the resolutely unpredictable Mr. J. brings
his Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company to UCLA for a
collaboration with the Orion String Quartet. Both of his programs
begin with the West Coast premieres of "Verbum" and

<LD>   Challenging conventional definitions of theatrical dance for more
than 31 years, the ever experimental, hyper-gymnastic Pilobolus Dance
Theatre has almost as many awards as bruises. Though no stranger to
Southland audiences, its current tour comes after performances in
Salt Lake City, where Pilobolus premiered "The Brass Ring," a one-act
work commissioned by the 2002 Winter Olympics. You can decide for
yourselves whether "Brass" rates the bronze or the gold tonight at
the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, where the program also includes
"Tsu-ku-Tsu" and "Symbiosis." Saturday night's program ] in Escondido
features the Olympic piece along with "Walklyndon" and "Davenen."</LD>

Walt Disney Concert Hall. The finish line is on Hope Street just
north of Olympic Boulevard. Be there before 10:50 a.m. to see winners

mile. The course has 10 entertainment centers and a Finish Line

<LD>   It's one thing to understand calculus in college, but imagine
trying to figure out Los Angeles. That's what UCLA architecture and
urban design students in Thom Mayne's class did. The result is seven
proposals for downtown, compiled in a book and the exhibition "L.A.
Now: Shaping a New Vision for Downtown Los Angeles." A panel
discussion, "L.A. Now: The Culture of Flux" at the Hammer Museum,
should provide a taste of the topics on the table. Mayne, principal
architect at the L.A. firm Morphosis, and other contributors to the
project--including artist Sam Durant, public radio producer Frances
Anderton and writer Dennis Hensley--will discuss L.A.'s urban
condition.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-foot red silk drape dangles flirtatiously from the ceiling of
the Sunset Room. A sliver of a girl in a sheer leotard takes to the
fabric and proceeds to climb it, using only hands and bare feet. From
there she manipulates the cloth into an acrobatic swing from which
she dangles in a series of lithe silhouettes.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, two guys in white mambo shirts and black vinyl
pants launch into a schmaltzy "Night at the Roxbury"-style comedy
bit. Their rubber-faced expressions, overenthusiastic dancing and
lustful gestures shatter the tranquil mood. They pluck an embarrassed
female "volunteer" from the crowd to whiz juggling pins over her
head, and offer her a playful pelvic-thrust demonstration.</LD>
<LD>   Each Wednesday, a seven-person troupe called Melange transforms
this posh Hollywood nightclub from A-list bar scene into an
avant-garde cabaret. "Melange," fittingly, means mixture. The members
range from former circus performers to national sports champions, and
they perform acts from the dramatically beautiful to the shamelessly
ridiculous. Gymnastic stunts and interpretive dance draw gasps one
minute; over-the-top clowns in oversized blue alien suits have
patrons coughing up their drinks the next.</LD>
<TE>   Aaron Easterbrooks, a former clown for Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey Circus, brought the ingredients for Melange together, along
with fellow circus alumnus James Maltman. They found acrobats of all
stripes and assembled a sort of mini-circus.</TE>
<TE>   Any worry that L.A. was too staid for such unlikely entertainments
faded when they landed the weekly spot at the popular Sunset Room,
which the club has dubbed "Sunset Rouge" (an oblique reference to the
club in the film "Moulin Rouge"). Sunset Room owner Brad Johnson said
it's given his 2-year-old restaurant a distinctive Wednesday night.
"A lot of people tell me it's unlike anything they've ever been to,"
he said. "Seeing that kind of talent up close and in an environment
like this, people are just blown away." Or, as Easterbrooks says,
"They really get to see us sweat!"</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Steben and John Hay, who both spent much of the last decade
with Cirque du Soleil, provide one of the most spectacular routines,
a trapeze number of astonishing body twists. Their flying contortions
would be a dramatic addition to any steak and martini, but those at
dinner tables near the stage are about 10 feet from the swinging
aerialists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such an intimate show," Hay says. It's a small portrait
painting compared to the surreal landscape of Cirque du Soleil. But
there's something satisfying in that; the individual details stand
out. "We often hear that people can see the connection between us,"
says Hay, who is romantically involved with Steben. "In a big theater
you miss out on that, all you see is an image."</TE>
<TE>   The troupe's members--who provide their own props, lighting and
music--say their biggest challenge now is refining technical aspects.
They hope to add lighting effects, an art director and location
scouter. They're also on the lookout for others who have talents with
no obvious outlet. "We know there are a lot of performers who feel
the same way we did and don't know where to go," Hay says.</TE>
<TE>   Their three-hour rehearsals each week--which they don't
necessarily need after years of honing their skills--are more an
opportunity to see how their diverse bits fit together.</TE>
<TE>   "We just get nuts, having fun and laughing," Steben says. "We
thought we would get to the point where we would disagree
artistically because we all have different tastes, but we found
that's what makes it fun."</TE>
<TE>   Success is a beneficial byproduct. Melange has added a second
residency on Thursday nights at Mum's restaurant in Long Beach
starting in April, and hopes for others.</TE>
<TE>   As Steben says, "All we need is 20 feet up."</TE>
<TE>   Melange, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. at the Sunset Room, 1430 N. Cahuenga
Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 463-0004. $15, cover; $10 with dinner.
Starting April 11, also Thursdays at Mums, 144 Pine Ave., Long Beach,
(562) 437-7700, $60 a person includes dinner.</TE>

<HD>The Signal for Brazilian Barbecue</HD>
<DH>At Green Field, there's no shortage of meat once diners
give waiters the go-ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a Saturday night at Green Field, a new Brazilian churrascaria
in Long Beach, and four of us were sipping caipirinha cocktails by an
artificial wall of water in the foyer. The dining room was jammed and
we were waiting for a table.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing unusual in this picture, eh? Except that Green Field is a
huge ski lodge-style building with room for more than 300 diners.</LD>
<LD>   We thought back to some other restaurants that tried their luck in
this building. The Deli and Papa's Western Barbecue always seemed
cavernous and empty. You couldn't say that about Green Field.</LD>
<TE>   So we waited. It was half an hour before we were seated, but we
didn't complain. Our caipirinhas, made with Brazilian sugarcane rum
(cachaca) and lots of muddled lime, were perfectly refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   What is it about this place that has excited Long Beach? Apart
from being exceptionally large, it isn't so very different from other
Brazilian-style barbecues in the Southland. All the meat is cooked
over open flames and carved to order at the table, and the skewers
keep coming until you say to stop. There's a huge salad bar where you
can fill up on composed salads (thus keeping the management's meat
costs down). The only distinctive design element, other than the open
kitchen, is a giant mural depicting a Rio landmark, Sugar Loaf
Mountain, on the rear wall.</TE>
<TE>   Once seated, most people follow a different strategy than they
might at a buffet. They hit the salad bar first, then the station of
hot dishes; then they finally signal the waiters to start delivering
skewers of meat.</TE>
<TE>   To signal, diners turn over the wooden block that sits on each
table. As long as the red side faces up, the waiters will stay away.
Turn the green side up and you'll inaugurate a parade of barbecued
meat that will rival any you've ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe you do want to lay down a stratum of guarnicoes
(trimmings) from the salad bar. There's a lovely hearts of palm
salad, a creamy potato salad and a delicious black bean soup to go
with some crunchy, golf ball-sized cheese breads that most people
can't stop eating.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the hot station, it's even harder to avoid filling up
before you get a chance at the skewers of grilled meat. It features
little pieces of chicken fried crisp and sugary fried bananas. One
large tub contains feijoada, the national dish of Brazil: black beans
stewed with sausage and pork ribs. The idea is to add rice and a heap
of the crunchy fried manioc flour called farofa. Watch it, though:
It's filling.</TE>
<TE>   When you turn your block green side up, the skewers will be upon
you almost instantly. When I ate there, the first to arrive were beef
shish kebab, beef rib-eye and prime rib, all perfectly seasoned with
salt, pepper and a hint of garlic and perfectly cooked: blood rare in
middle, crusty outside. Maybe this explains the crowds. Green Field
is a beef lover's dream.</TE>
<TE>   The next round was a less flashy selection: chunks of turkey
wrapped in bacon (strangely little flavor) and chicken hearts (just
fine, though they seemed to turn off most of the people at
surrounding tables). The third round contained a rather timid
Brazilian sausage: nothing fiery or exotic, just a mealy-textured
pork sausage spitting juice and fat. In this context, it seemed to be
filler, like some of the salad bar items.</TE>
<TE>   But there was also delicious cubed lamb, which might have been
just a little too rare (no one at our table was in a mood to
complain), tender pork loin and some good pork spare ribs. Later they
brought us more exotic stuff: tiny barbecued quail and crisp little
pieces of rabbit. Unfortunately, as good as they were, we were far
too full by that time to do them justice. With regret, we turned our
blocks red side up.</TE>
<TE>   While you're eating, you can drink Brazilian drinks such as
maracuja juice (similar to passion fruit) or guarana soda, a soft
drink with a tropical fruit flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The one disappointment is the a la carte desserts, just a parade
of sugary, gaudily decorated cakes.</TE>
<TE>   But who goes to a churrascaria for dessert? Hey, who even expects
to eat dessert?</TE>
<TE>   Green Field Churrascaria, 5305 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long
Beach (562) 597-0906. Open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. Full bar.
Parking lot. All major cards. Buffet for one, $11.95 lunch, $19.95
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   What to get: feijoada, fried bananas, rib-eye steak, quail.</TE>

<HD>It's Swing Time!</HD>
<DH>'Swingers' sparked a fad. The trendiness faded, but the
energy hasn't as new fans discover the dance. Rule No. 1: Men have to
lead. And it's OK to touch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ROMMELMANN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's about 35, starting to bald, a jellyroll taxing the waistband of
his chinos as he hops from foot to supinated foot, eyeing the 40
other people gathered at the Derby, waiting for an intermediate Lindy
Hop class to begin.</LD>
<LD>   A snap judgment is that he's out of his league, trying to hang
with this crew, guys sporting vintage '50s sport-shirts and girls in
satin and snoods. And then a record is cued up, Nat "King" Cole
crooning "Paper Moon." He offers his hand to the woman nearest to
him, a long-eyed vixen with a black Betty Page bob. He pulls her
close, spins her away, dips and flips her, all the while his feet
gliding smoothly as butter over a hot griddle.</LD>
<LD>   When the song ends, he thanks his partner and moves on to the next
girl; he may be an accountant or a car dealer by day, but by night,
he's a Casanova on the dance floor.</LD>
<TE>   Wait a second: Didn't we hear enough about swing when the movie
"Swingers" came out? Yes, and no. Back in 1996, when the movie was
released, every hipster captivated by the high life featured in the
film ransacked thrift stores for seamed stockings and two-tone shoes,
tried a little jumping and jiving at the Los Feliz club the Derby
(where some scenes in "Swingers" were filmed), and then split for the
lounges that replaced swing as the incandescent scene of the moment.
It was an exodus that, for people who'd been swinging pre-"Swingers,"
was a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   What remained was a core group of swing-a-holics who've been
swinging for years if not decades, and who make weekly if not nightly
trips to the clubs around town, many of which, in the words of one
club promoter, are "flying under the radar."</TE>
<TE>   Swing had fallen off the radar for most of the past three decades
in part because it requires the man to lead and the woman to follow,
a practice that flies in the face of two movements wrought in the
'60s: equality of the sexes and a "do your own thing" ethos that
meant dancers stopped holding one another.</TE>
<TE>   Today, holding is in again, equal doesn't mean separate and
swing's underground status is changing as the dance is rediscovered.
Those who find and try swing, usually fall in love with it.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the current swing craze has managed to escape the clutches of
the jeunesse doree/WB set, at least for now. Why should they embrace
it? Swing dancing requires perseverance, a discipline that's the
antithesis of hot now and gone tomorrow. Despite hipster apathy,
swing clubs are packed, their sheer numbers are swelling as would-be
swingers sign up for a simple route back into one another's arms:
free lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Swing nights can be found in Masonic lodges, YMCAs, restaurants,
any place that has a wooden dance floor and a stage to spin records.
And though the venues are open to anyone--many do not serve alcohol
and hence can admit an all-ages crowd--"There's a hierarchy of people
who dance," says Karen Wilson, a three-night-a-week swinger who hosts
Southern California's premier swing Web site, nocturne.com. "You have
the people who were dancing before 'Swingers,' then people who
started then and left.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was that Gap commercial." She groans, remembering
the havoc the 1998 TV ad caused. "The only thing the people who saw
the commercial knew were throwing each other around; people were
getting kicked in the head left and right. And they all wore khakis!"
she adds, with mock-horror. "But then they all left, or most of
them."</TE>
<TE>   This is how it begins. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and
welcome to the world famous Derby," says instructor Roscoe
Farnsworth, having the men and women line up facing one another. "All
you're gonna do is side, side, rock step." He's teaching the basic
steps to East Coast swing, a six-count dance; other popular swing
dances include the Lindy Hop, done to an eight-count, and West Coast
swing, a combination of six- and eight-count steps.</TE>
<TE>   "Good. Again," says Farnsworth, as his fellow instructor, Molly
Shock, demonstrates a turn. "The turns are just so you don't get
bored," says Shock. "If you learn nothing else from what we've taught
you, you will not look bad out on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, no one looks bad right now, sartorially speaking, with
fashions running from zoot suits and cuffed jeans (for guys) and
gored crepe dresses and midriff-baring sailor suits (for gals), to
just-come-from-the-office casual. "Only die-hards and new people wear
vintage anymore," whispers Wilson, who wears overalls.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to a good turn, gentlemen, is to be very clear in your
direction," says Farnsworth. "Where are you telling her to go?
Ladies, be receptive, let him turn you. Guys, you've got to protect
that lady. Is she gonna hit her head on a ledge? Is the guy dancing
next to you drunk? It's up to you to protect that lady! Remember,
guys, you're in control."</TE>
<TE>   "That was probably the hardest thing about learning to dance,"
says Wilson, who started eight years ago. "The giving up control. The
guy leads, he has to lead, and to learn to let him do that, it's
hard, but it's also great."</TE>
<TE>   The couples rotate partners every minute or so. Some are smooth as
cream, others not, though no one seems to mind, except Wilson, who
winces at a couple doing, well, everything wrong: She leads, and
though she weighs about 85 pounds, her feet hit the floor like
cinderblocks. He, on the other hand, is so spindly and nervous, his
dancing has the frantic quality of a bird caught in a net.</TE>
<TE>   When the class ends at 9:30, Shock throws on a few records to tide
over the dancers before the band comes on. "I've been teaching here
for five years, though I've been coming to the Derby for seven," she
says. "My first partner was Jon Favreau--this was two years before he
made 'Swingers.' After the film came out, the classes went from
having about 12 people per class to 150; now we get about 20 to 40
people per class, though we're starting to see another resurgence."</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of deejay [swing] clubs these days," adds Shock,
whose day job is a video editor for A&amp;E's "Biography." "There's a
younger crowd at those places, whereas the Derby is mostly 30-plus.
It's just about the only place where there's still live music and
dance every night.... Everybody can listen to this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no more gorgeous swing club in L.A. than the
Derby, with its massive room swagged in crimson velvet, lighting as
low as a cathedral, and gigantic oval bar patterned after the one in
the film "Mildred Pierce," the reason the swing-hounds are out in
force tonight is Royal Crown Revue, a home-grown big band with a
rabidly loyal following.</TE>
<TE>   The place is standing-room-only by 10:30, when the seven-piece RCR
takes the stage, the players in pinstripes and white ties. Frontman
Eddie Nichols, who looks like a cross between Popeye and Hyde on
"That 70's Show," smirks at the audience. "You all having a good
time?" he asks; the crowd hoots in response.</TE>
<TE>   Though the dance floor in front of the stage can comfortably
accommodate about 12 swinging couples, there are twice as many out
there: girls with platinum hair and silk roses tucked behind their
ears, guys in porkpie hats and peg-leg pants, all backed by a blazing
horn section that makes the room look like a D-day celebration. And
yet there's also a chap in a black cowboy hat and leather duster
ensemble, a woman in a gold sequin halter that looks as though it
fell out of Liza Minnelli's closet and a couple of kids in
slacker-chic. As Nichols segues into a triple-time version of "Lover,
Where Can You Be?" it's clear all these people have earned a right to
be on the floor; that the fervor and sweet release is available to
anyone, so long as they put in the time it takes to be a real
swinger.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked into a Tarzana  mini-mall, and next door to a
fluff-and-fold that perfumes the parking lot with fabric softener,
Paladino's looks like an everyman's bar, which it is, except on
Tuesdays, when the swing crowd converges. The place resembles an Elks
lodge, circa 1970, with turquoise and fuchsia velour captain's chair
and a bare-bones stage.</TE>
<TE>   After a small 8-9 p.m. class led by instructors Kim Clever (who
appeared in the opening swing scene of David Lynch's "Mulholland
Drive") and David Frutos, the room quickly fills. Dressed mostly in
jeans and Nike separates, ages 21 to 75, the dancers evince not one
scintilla of hipster gloss; in fact, they look like any group of
folks one might see walking around the Glendale Galleria, until
Frutos mans the deejay booth and starts spinning '50s tunes.
Immediately, there are 60 people on the floor, switching partners
after each song, chatting with friends, bragging to one another about
their kids.</TE>
<TE>   "She's taking the bar exam next week," says Bernie Dovbish, 70,
pointing to his daughter Tevaya. "I taught her to dance when she was
3; I've been dancing and teaching since 1951. We're known as the
dancing family," he says, gathering his wife, Eileen, in his arms.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the scene is ageless, open to anyone, a triumph of
aptitude over attitude. What is it about swing that makes it so
egalitarian? "It's the music," says Chip Hornick, 39, a computer
programmer at UCLA, who began dancing two years ago and who says his
first experience with swing was at Baskin-Robbins, when he heard "Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy." "I just got into the music so much. This stuff,
you listen to it and you just have to swing. Plus, I love the social
aspect.... You can go up to a stranger and you're basically speaking
the same physical language; you get out there and do a little
performance together. It's cool."</TE>
<TE>   The coolest people on the floor tonight are Allen and Rudy Hall.
He's tall and lanky, in a Kanga cap and tennis shoes; she's a petite
brunet in a sailor outfit, and their dancing is exuberant and
theatrical: He plants his finger in the top of her head, "spinning"
her as though she were his puppet, then stands looking sheepish as
she shakes a mock-scolding finger at him. A 20-something girl in red
cargo pants looks on in awe, and jumps off her stool when Allen holds
out his hand to her, offering her a dance.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in Minnesota but travel by motor home six months a year,"
says Rudy, taking a rare break. "We go south of the ice; we travel
until we hit liquid water, and then we go left or right. But we
always spend several months in the Los Angeles area, going from club
to club."</TE>
<TE>   Rudy's been dancing for 39 years but says she had "the hardest
time" getting Allen to. "He finally started when he retired, 13 years
ago. I think he took to it," she says, laughing, as she watches Allen
and the girl do a belly-to-belly shimmy.</TE>
<TE>   No hair gel, no high heels, no booze. It's opening night of the
Lindy Binge Exchange, being held at Lindy Groove, a Thursday night
club located in a Masonic temple in Pasadena. "Exchange" is just what
it sounds like: a swapping, in this case of space and scene. People
drive and fly in from all over the country to check out what's
swinging in L.A., and bring information about what's happening in
their part of the world. Brandy, a budding journalist, and Nick, a
dance instructor, both in their early 20s, just got in from Vegas.
Where will they be staying?</TE>
<TE>   "Not really sure yet," says Nick, laying a bunch of fliers for the
Sin City exchange he's organizing on a receiving table. "Have bag,
will travel." Nat "King" Cole's "Welcome to the Club" is playing in
the dance hall, and though it's early by club standards--8
p.m.--there are already 30 couples on the floor, gently easing into
an evening that will last until at least 4 a.m. Lindy Groove can stay
open late because it serves no booze, the only libations a large
cold-water dispenser.</TE>
<TE>   When "Be Careful if You Can't Be Good" comes on, a few couples
stake out spots close to the music, sometimes called the "cat's
corner," where the best dancers hold sway. Rusty, who teaches swing
classes at the Neptunian Woman's Club in Playa del Rey, begins
leading three people in a group dance called the Shim Sham Shimmy,
while a dozen high school kids in jeans and sneakers, including a
tall, gangly boy with legs loose as cooked spaghetti, toss each other
in the air and squeal. Which is when one realizes: These kids could
be home watching a rerun of "The Simpsons," but instead, they're
dancing, and not only with each another.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to dance?" a 19-year-old blond boy asks a 40-plus
woman. "OK, but I don't really know what I'm doing," she says.</TE>
<TE>   And she doesn't. He's got to manhandle her into position, visibly
tug to get her to turn under and shake off her apologies when she
mashes his feet. And yet when the song ends, he doesn't run for the
exit, but speaks to her for a few minutes, giving her tips on how she
might learn this or that maneuver. Where else does one see a
19-year-old young man willing to hold and gently tutor a woman old
enough to be his mother?</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that swing is not for those night-lifers who crave
being seen on the scene, and there's a reason: Dancing takes time and
deliberation; you have to listen and learn, to be in it for the long
haul, which is diametrically opposed to showing up at the
club-of-the-week with a little cologne and cleavage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sort of underground," says Lance Powell, a software
developer by day who started Lindy Groove last year. "It's about a
year commitment to get to the point where you can get out there and
actually dance." His eyes wander to a raven-haired girl doing a
goosey move with her neck. "Taylor's a great follow," he says, "as
you can see." How long has Taylor been dancing? "Four years," says
Taylor Mathews, a 19-year-old student at UCLA. "I love it; it's so
fun. With every person, you have a different connection."</TE>
<TE>   "We just opened in January. We wanted to have a place where people
of all ages could dance and have a good time," says Holly Dumaux, one
of the Swing Pit's promoters. "We used to do it in a bar,
Delmonico's, in Pasadena, but we really don't drink--we're dancers,
we're out there doing something. So the bars don't really like us,
because we don't pull in a bar." Hence, the current space, in the
Glendale YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   It's 5 p.m., the third day of the Lindy Binge Exchange, and people
have been dancing since 2. The large room is packed, the air thick
and humid. Everybody seems to know everyone else, and even to an
interloper, there are plenty of familiar faces: there's Karen Wilson,
incorporating some hyperactive Charleston moves into her routine; and
the Dovbish family; and Taylor Mathews, dancing with Lance Powell;
and the Halls, Allen in a pair of navy wool sailor pants with "Boogie
Britches" embroidered on the right flank, Rudy in clam-diggers and
saddle shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The deejay has been flown in from Vegas, there are swing dance
clips from the '40s and '50s being beamed onto the ceiling, and the
place is a riot of activity, literally no place to sit or stand,
which means ducking arms and feet and twirling skirts in an effort to
check out the scene. It looks like nothing so much as a photo out of
an old Life magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "I went on a Web site for swing, and there was a shot of all these
people enjoying the music and dancing," says Chip Hornick. "I was
looking at it closely, to see if I recognized anyone, when I realized
it was a picture from the 1940s. But it looks the same." Between 6
and 7 p.m., there's a discernable migration for the door, as people
head for Swing Heaven in Plummer Park, or KC's in Whittier, or the
Pasadena Ballroom. Allen Hall's got out his Thomas Guide, showing
out-of-towners how to get where they're going on a night that
undoubtedly will not end until morning.</TE>
<TE>   "One cautionary note," says Allen, with a wry smile, "if you don't
want to be doing this when you're my age, stop now; it's worse than
dope. Seriously, once you're hooked, you're hooked."</TE>

<LD>My brother once summed up my coordination thus: "Nan, you could break
your arm rolling up the car window." This, coupled with a tendency to
hear white noise whenever instructions are given, has led to a
lifelong belief that if a dance involves following, I better sit
down. And yet watching people swing dance is akin to catching a virus
and the only known cure is to take a class, which I did one recent
Saturday night at the Derby.</LD>
<LD>   "Remember, some of the nicest people in the world have no rhythm,"
says Francisco, reassuring the participants at the beginners class.
There are 50 of us, most trying to hide behind someone else. No go.
"Gentlemen, form a clump in the center," Francisco says. "Ladies,
join hands and circle around them."</LD>
<LD>   Once in position, we get our marching orders, literally. "Just
march in place, window foot first," Francisco says. Good, no
remembering right and left, I think, lifting one foot, then the
other. "OK, now rock back on the ball of your right foot--that's the
part below your toes.... Great, you've got the basics. OK, gentlemen,
find a partner."</LD>
<TE>   The guys fan out and pick girls. Several, including yours truly,
are not picked; Francisco softens the blow by calling us "bonus
girls," and promises we'll get guys next time. Couples hold hands,
bonus girls hold air and we all execute turns for about a minute.
"OK, rotate and introduce yourself to your new partner," instructs
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   A short stocky man introduces himself as Armand and asks if this
is my first time. How could he tell? And yet despite what I'm sure is
dance-induced rigor mortis, Armand has a sure touch, tilting my wrist
just so to let me know it's time to turn ... now. Though it defies
history and logic, I'm actually in-step.</TE>
<TE>   We continue to rotate partners: Ed's eyes have a hysterical cast
as he spins us into other couples; Jeremy has tight, precise moves
that make the dance feel sexy and right; Chris windmills his arms and
clocks me in the head; John is tall and strong and easy to follow. By
the end of the hour, I have danced with 12 guys, learned three turns
and have the basics down.</TE>
<TE>   Before the class is over, Francisco gives us a few rules of the
road. "Gentlemen, always lead a lady onto the floor, and lead her
back off afterward. And get over being afraid to ask a lady to dance.
Ladies, it's all right to say no to a dance, but you can't say yes to
someone else. And remember to smile and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   He cues up some music and leaves us to our own devices. I am off
to one side, paranoid about being the eternal bonus girl, when Armand
asks for my hand. He leads me onto the floor and spins me three times
this way, four times that, has me spin him when I didn't even know I
could, all while anchored by window foot, other foot, rock step.</TE>
<TE>   When people say, "If I can do it, anyone can," they are usually
being kind or dismissive, but I say it in earnest. Just ask my
brother.</TE>

<LD>It's whale-watching time again as Southern California's coastal
communities put the finishing touches on festivals celebrating the
annual Pacific gray whale migration. In December and January, the
whales make their way from the chilly seas off Alaska to the balmy
waters of Baja, where they breed and give birth. Then in February
through early April, the mammals head back to their feeding grounds
in the Bering Sea.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Sunday in Oxnard with Channel Islands Harbor's
Celebration of the Whales, the next four weekends will feature
numerous whale-related activities around the region.</LD>
<LD>   Point Mugu will re-create a whaling village on March 10; on two
weekends, March 9-10 and March 16-17, Dana Point will celebrate its
31st annual Festival of Whales; and whale-themed festivals are slated
March 17 in Ventura and March 23-24 in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Feb. 1 is traditionally peak time, when whales start heading north
with their newborns, says Mike Bursk, a marine biologist who leads
whale-watch cruises for the Ocean Institute in Dana Point. The
festivals and cruises, however, wait until March in hopes of avoiding
bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   Whale Numbers May</TE>
<TE>   Be Down This Year</TE>
<TE>   Although March may not be the busiest month for the migration,
whales are spotted nearly every day, says Bursk.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of migrating whales is reportedly down this year,
possibly due to "a shortage of food or other natural causes," says
David Leach, operations manager of the Ventura County Maritime
Museum. The whales--especially mothers and calves--that do make the
trek follow the shore, which makes it fairly easy to catch a glimpse
of them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the longest natural migration in the world," Leach says
of the 10,000- to 14,000-mile trips from the Bering Sea. "This is a
great opportunity to see nature in action." And a great economic
opportunity for host communities.</TE>
<TE>   Activities vary by community but a common goal is to inform the
public about marine life.</TE>
<TE>   "The gray whales are the only whales that get this close to the
shore," says Bursk, who will lead outings aboard the Ocean
Institute's research vessel, Spirit of Dana Point, a replica of a
1770s Revolutionary War ship.</TE>
<TE>   Festivals About</TE>
<TE>   More Than Whales</TE>
<TE>   So what does a whale festival entail?</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, it includes kayak racing, tide-pool touch tanks,
aquarium presentations and a wide range of other events divided
between Fisherman's Wharf and Marine Emporium Landing.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point's festival includes a street fair, antique boat
exhibition and sand-castle workshop March 9-10, and Taste of Dana
Point Harbor, a surfboard exhibit and free ocean-related activities
on March 16-17.</TE>
<TE>   In Malibu, a free shuttle will carry passengers between Point Mugu
and Leo Carrillo state parks, where food, entertainment, arts and
crafts, and marine conservation information will commemorate the
annual migration.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Harbor Village will offer marine exhibits, touch tanks and
entertainment throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara will present arts and crafts, a kids' carnival, live
bands, food and marine education along State Street.</TE>
<TE>   Whale-watching excursions will operate during all of the
festivals, except at Point Mugu, where festival-goers can view the
majestic mammals from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually spot 15 to 20 whales during the festival," says Cara
O'Brien, a state park interpreter. "The calves have been born [in
Baja California] and they get so close to the shore it's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   If you're opting for a whale-watch cruise, they typically last
about three hours, ranging in price from $15 to $40, with discounts
for kids. Although kids of all ages will probably enjoy the boat
ride, a spokesperson for Dana Wharf Sportfishing suggests taking
young children earlier in the day, when the water is usually calmer.
There's no guarantee that whales will materialize during a cruise,
but dolphins and other marine life are usually plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   "I get calls asking what time [the whales] will be out," says Kim
Tilly of the Dana Point Harbor Assn. "This isn't Sea World, it's
nature."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The actor who was Marisa Tomei's abusive husband in "In the
Bedroom" has also appeared in "Mission Impossible 2" and "Without
Limits."</LD>
<LD>   "An Italian Straw Hat": My ideal weekend would start with friends
at the Silent Movie Theatre for Buster Keaton's "The Navigator" and
Rene Clair's [1927 comedy] "An Italian Straw Hat." They are really
good about playing Keaton, Chaplin, Lloyd and D.W. Griffith, but I
don't think I've ever seen "An Italian Straw Hat" there. Silent film
seems particularly suited to comedy.</LD>
<LD>   Short People: Randy Newman is perhaps my favorite songwriter and,
of course, he's a quintessential L.A. musician. I love hearing him
play and sometimes he has played in small L.A. venues. I saw him at
the Wadsworth Theater. It would be great to hear him at a small,
outdoor venue like on the patio at the Cat &amp; Fiddle.</LD>
<TE>   Kids on Loan: I like to borrow some kids from a friend or relative
and go up to Griffith Park and play games with them. I like chase,
hide-and-go-seek, and we take Frisbees and balls. I've been told that
I am very good at being a 5-year-old. I have a couple of friends and
a couple of relatives whose kids are in the right age range and, of
course, the parents are more than willing to let me borrow them for a
few hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The Misanthrope": On a perfect weekend, I would go to a matinee
at A Noise Within in Glendale or the South Coast Repertory in Costa
Mesa. I like Moliere, and I saw South Coast Repertory's production of
"The Misanthrope" several years ago, which I really liked. I saw
"Tartuffe" at A Noise Within. I have seen several things at A Noise
Within in Glendale and they are very good with classic theater.</TE>
<TE>   Running Away From L.A.: I like to go on a trail run in either
Mandeville or Topanga canyons. It's only 15 minutes away, but it
feels like teleportation, like you have been transported a hundred
miles outside the city. I tend to take the little trails. I usually
run by myself, and if I can make a circuit I will. Otherwise, it's an
up-and-back, and I keep an eye out for lizards and snakes.</TE>

<HD>Intimate, Wryly Agile 'Picasso'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Company Rep, formerly known as Actors Alley, makes a splashy and
spirited debut in "Picasso at the Lapin Agile," the group's inaugural
production as an independent production entity.</LD>
<LD>   Set in 1904, the play revolves around a hypothetical meeting
between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein, visionaries on the cusp of
immortality. The following year, Einstein would publish his
Earth-altering "Theory of Relativity," while Picasso was shortly to
launch the Cubist movement with his celebrated "Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon."</LD>
<LD>   Written by Steve Martin, "Picasso" was first produced by the
Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 1993. Buoyed by the mega-wattage of
Martin's film celebrity, the Steppenwolf's virtually unaltered
production, directed by Randall Arney, then had a record-breaking run
at the Westwood (now Geffen) Playhouse. The staging by Arney (now the
Geffen's artistic director), while noteworthy for the sheer lambency
of Martin's intellectual ideas, seemed oddly brittle and facile,
perhaps overwhelmed by the precincts of the theater's mid-sized
space.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, El Portal's Circle Theatre is a fittingly intimate
venue for the play, which director Hope Alexander has reconceived as
a flat-out vaudevillian romp, high-decibel and unflaggingly
energetic.</TE>
<TE>   Breathless, overwrought and fittingly passionate, Alexander's
runaway staging lends new robustness to Martin's desultory but
durable musings.</TE>
<TE>   The pell-mell pacing occasionally outstrips the comic abilities of
the actors, but those occasions are rare. As Einstein, Richard Wylie
is rumpled, wry and formidably endearing. Although too handsome for
Picasso, Eric Ashmore smolders satisfyingly in the role, while
Jessica Pennington and Melanie Ewbank play sizzling femmes fatales of
quite different stripes. Jackson DeGovia's wonderful set is cheerful
and eclectic, a likely spot for inspired conversation and flights of
cosmic fancy.</TE>
<TE>   "Picasso at the Lapin Agile," El Portal Center for the Arts, 5269
Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Wednesdays, 7 p.m.;
Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.
Ends March 24. $20-$25. (818) 508-4200. Running time: 1 hour, 20
minutes.</TE>

<HD>At Sonic Crossroads</HD>
<DH>Jamming by candlelight, Sound Tribe Sector 9 blends  the
hippie and rave cultures into a hybrid that is winning fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's an increasingly congested cultural intersection where hemp
fashions mingle with microchips, where vegan burritos are washed down
with enhanced smart drinks, where a '60s utopian love vibe blurs into
a space-age utopian love vibe.</LD>
<LD>   What are they dancing to at this crossroads? Very likely it's the
grooves of Sound Tribe Sector 9, a band that has locked into the
inevitable mating of hippie and rave cultures.</LD>
<LD>   Along with such acts as the Disco Biscuits, the New Deal, Lake
Trout and L.A. newcomers Woven, the Bay Area-based STS9 has developed
a hybrid of the improvisational jam-band aesthetic associated with
the Grateful Dead and the clipped loops-and-samples rhythms of
electronica.</LD>
<TE>   This quintet's brand of the sound--dubbed by some "organica"--may
be the most natural of the bunch. There's no deejay working samplers
and sequencers on stage, just a basic guitar-bass-keyboards-drums
ensemble fusing the styles, accompanied by a light show that blends
Summer of Love trippiness with the sensory overload of rave visuals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really joining the organic side of music with where
technology is going," bassist David Murphy says.</TE>
<TE>   But the band, which plays Friday at the House of Blues in West
Hollywood, had found some limitations to what it was doing and what
the conjoined audiences expected. After forming in 1997 in Atlanta,
STS9 earned a regional following on the Southeast college circuit.
But the audience seemed to be leaning to one side of the equation,
and the group felt it was getting into a bit of a rut.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while it was definitely predictable," says Murphy, 26. "We
were drawing on more of a college crowd, kids who were following
Phish. We started to break on the national scene just as Phish called
a hiatus [in fall 2000]. We don't sing, we stand there and jam for
three hours, so it was very appealing to more of a jam-band
audience."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   Proved Inspiring</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, the band itself leans more toward the hippie side as
well, with its candle-adorned stage sets and nods toward spirituality
(the group's name comes from a cycle in the Maya calendar). Still, in
mid-2000, the STS9 members, whose ages range now from 23 to 31,
packed up their gear and moved to San Francisco. Hippiedom's mecca
proved inspiring to the group as it sought to broaden its horizons
and following.</TE>
<TE>   Says Murphy: "Over the last year we've come back to putting more
emphasis on the improvisation and getting back to the jazz roots and
bringing computers on stage and getting into live sequencing--getting
away from the looping side of things and really add computers and
technology into a real-time, in-the-moment vibe."</TE>
<TE>   The band's upcoming two-CD live album, "Seasons O1," shows the
first stages of the progress. Long pieces are built on slowly
changing jazz-funk bass and percussion patterns, with Hunter Brown's
fluid guitar lines and David Phipps' flights on Fender Rhodes and
other tried-and-true keyboards recalling the early-'70s fusion
experiments of Miles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy doesn't relate the band's music to others in the jam world
but feels more kinship with progressive jazz trio Medeski, Martin &amp;
Wood as well as techno-based artists DJ Spooky and Roni Size, who
combine live performers with their samples-based music.</TE>
<TE>   The audience is indeed expanding as the STS9 members had hoped it
would.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last year and a half, especially in the bigger cities
like San Francisco, L.A., New York and Atlanta, we're seeing a more
diverse crowd," Murphy says. "There are older people, early 30s and
late 20s, coming after work to see our shows, as well as an
electronica fan base. It is a progression, and people need to
understand that the music isn't for just a hippie-band crowd."</TE>
<TE>   The band stands apart from the vast majority of acts in the
thriving jam band wave, which still relies on solo showboating while
talking a good game of collective creativity</TE>
<TE>   "They don't feature the virtuoso soloing that is the hallmark of
the scene," says Barry Smolin, producer and host of "The Music Never
Stops," a Friday evening radio show on KPFK-FM (90.7) devoted to the
Grateful Dead and current jam bands. "And they've amassed a large
following without the obnoxious self-promotion one encounters in
other up-and-coming bands."</TE>
<TE>   Now STS9 is looking to expand its platform further. In addition to
the House of Blues date, the band is playing several shows on the
SnoCore Icicle Ball tour in March in an eclectic bill with jam
favorite Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and L.A. Latin/hip-hop ensemble
Ozomatli, as well as the jam-centric High Sierra Festival during the
July 4 weekend in Quincy, Calif. Most significant, it's been booked
for the well-rounded Coachella Music and Arts Festival, whose acts
include Oasis, Bjork, Foo Fighters and the Chemical Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Being at Coachella with rock, electronic and hip-hop, a more
mainstream lineup--that's kind of where we're trying to go," Murphy
says.</TE>
<TE>   And from there?</TE>
<TE>   "We've discussed the concept of taking something on the road for
six weeks or so almost along the lines of Cirque de Soleil," he says.
"To push ourselves musically to write a score of music totally in
sync with other artists, that's something we'd be more called to do,
sit in a room with artists and dancers for weeks creating something.
In some ways our music almost caters to that--free form, but
structured."</TE>

<HD>A Filmmaker for All Sounds</HD>
<DH>Movies* The man who explored grunge for 'Hype!' took on
hip-hop when he saw scratching was akin to film editing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES III</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Doug Pray arrives at the Astro coffee shop in Silver Lake
looking like a man caught in a time warp. His close-cropped, sandy
brown hair and classic sideburns fit right into the eatery's retro
'50s decor.</LD>
<LD>   At 41, Pray is anything but retro. The filmmaker arguably is on
the cutting edge, having directed two of the most distinctive musical
films in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   His 1996 film "Hype!" was an exploration of the Seattle-based
grunge rock movement, and included such bands as Nirvana, Soundgarden
and Pearl Jam. The documentary won critical notice at the Sundance
Film Festival. Kristine McKenna, writing for The Times, called the
film "a brilliant synthesis of social anthropology and
entertainment." Now Pray brings that sensibility to his latest
project, "Scratch," which arrives in L.A. theaters this week.</LD>
<TE>   "Scratch" is a guided tour of the frequently misunderstood world
of hip-hop, culminating in an analysis of its least-understood
performer, the hip-hop DJ. When producers Brad Blondheim and Ernest
Meza ("Cliffhanger," "The General's Daughter") approached Pray in
1999 about making the film, the director resisted the idea of taking
on a hip-hop movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I just really felt like this was something that a real hip-hop
expert should do, someone who is just born and raised hip-hop and
understands that [culture]," Pray said. "And I was burned out because
'Hype!' took me four or five years to make. It's a big process, it
just takes a lot out of you to make a documentary ... [and] is
difficult to justify that many years of really not being paid."</TE>
<TE>   Blondheim and Meza wouldn't take no for an answer. "They started
sending me CDs," Pray said. The first was by Rob Swift, one of the
masters of hip-hop core music-making techniques called DJ
"scratching."</TE>
<TE>   The technique involves the manipulation of a vinyl record on a
turntable and the sound it makes when the needle rhythmically
scratches back and forth across the surface of the record. To the
undiscerning, this might have seemed like noise, but Pray, a trained
musician instinctively understood it as a musical language. "I'm a
musician, I have played bass and guitar, a little bit of keyboard,
and really grew up with music a lot. So I did have an ear for
something that seemed different and interesting, and Rob Swift kind
of blew me away."</TE>
<TE>   Pray listened to the dozens of CDs that were sent to him, then
decided he would take a chance and meet with some of the marquee DJs
he had been listening to. Pray met Mix Master Mike at Meza's house.
"He was just so completely cool and seemed really open to the idea of
a movie that would expose the culture in a different way." The
filmmaker began to realize that hip-hop was not that different from
the grunge rock movement of "Hype!" "Basically, the whole
do-it-yourself movement, like put out your own records, so like you
have these guys just putting out their own records of them just
scratching, of them just totally being DJs, [is] the exact same idea
that Nirvana was doing or any of those bands up in Seattle" in
producing and distributing their own records. He emphasized the two
movements also share a "love of vinyl because Seattle is really a
vinyl-based revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Pray committed in May 1999 to direct the project and began putting
together his production team. Earlier that year, he had edited the
Albert and Allen Hughes film "American Pimp." Pray got the twins,
directors of such films as "Menace II Society" and "From Hell," to
join his team as executive producers, and they provided technical
expertise and editing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Next, he hired cinematographer Robert Bennett ("Hype!," "American
History X"), who is noted for his coverage of live performances.</TE>
<TE>   David Bartlett, whose work includes "Total Recall" and "Speed,"
joined in the critical role of sound editor. Production began in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Pray, who also edited the film, applied techniques in his editing
process that he learned from the film's stars--the so-called
"turntablists" (whose story his film essentially chronicles). "I
can't DJ at all ... I'm terrible. I can't scratch or anything, but I
realized one night, I was really like a DJ. You take an interview and
look for the break in the interview. I could go this way, or I could
go that way. You could mix weird things, and it makes you want to
have more fun with transitions, like how do we get out of this scene.
In the end you start feeling like a DJ."</TE>
<TE>   "Scratch," which screened in 2001 at Sundance, has an
easy-to-follow narrative. Pray, as an outsider, takes uninitiated
viewers into the world of the hip-hopper through interviews with
pioneers, clever editing and a soundtrack featuring many of hip-hop's
classic recordings. For hard-core hip-hoppers, he follows the origins
of DJ scratching from Grand Wizard Theodore's discovery to GrandMixer
D.ST's beginnings on Herbie Hancock's "Rock It," and follows the
progress of its new-school innovators Qbert Babu and Mix Master Mike
and their contributions to the turntablist movement.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also examines the international scope of DJing as
well, displaying the diversity of race, color, gender and openness of
innovation. "I love the fact that I just made a film, and it's one of
the first films I've ever seen in my life where [diversity] was never
an issue," Pray said. "It was never, 'Let's be sure to keep this
diverse,' because that's exactly how the community is."</TE>
<TE>   "Scratch" plays Friday through Thursday at the Nuart, 11272 Santa
Monica Blvd., L.A., (310) 478-6379.</TE>

<LD>   "Dog Mouth"--One of L.A.'s most distinctive home-grown
playwrights, John Steppling has spent the last few years in Europe, a
fugitive from the soulless grind of the California dream machine. For
Steppling, the current production of "Dog Mouth" at the Evidence Room
proves both a homecoming and a departure.</LD>
<TE>   The setting of "Dog Mouth"--the Arizona desert--is, in itself, a
statement of intent for Steppling. In this stark desert landscape,
there is no there there--nothing to covet and little to desire--just
a train track and sand, the central components of Jason Adams'
strikingly spare set.</TE>
<TE>   Dog Mouth (Stephen Davies), the protagonist of the play, lives an
existence as bare as the country he inhabits. The head of a murderous
hobo gang, Dog Mouth entertains no apparent need for human
connection, save for his criminal conniving with scruffy underlings
and the occasional roll in the sand with Nyah (Nia Gwynne), his
pregnant young girlfriend. Once a noted breeder of fighting dogs, Dog
Mouth is considering buying a pit bull from Weeks (Hugh Dane), yet he
wants nothing to do with Nyah or her child....When Nyah asks him to
"feel" their child moving in her womb, Dog Mouth must pull back--or
suffer a fatal fall. A have-not with a vengeance, he's an elemental
figure--Lear on a sandy heath, cast out by his own design.</TE>

<DH>Musicians at four venues come together to raise money for
artists' rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Social Distortion leader Mike Ness wrote "Ball &amp; Chain" in 1988 as a
testament to one man's rise from the pit of despair, but when he sang
it Tuesday at the Wiltern Theatre, its refrain seemed the ideal
summation of many musicians' view of the record industry's standard
contract provisions.</LD>
<LD>   Ness was among more than a dozen acts who took part in the
four-venue Concert for Artists Rights, a fund-raiser expected to
generate more than $2 million for the Recording Artists Coalition, a
new lobbying group created to give musicians a unified voice at the
legislative table.</LD>
<LD>   Concerts at the Forum in Inglewood, Universal Amphitheatre, Long
Beach Arena and the Wiltern Theatre were staged to raise money for
the coalition to lobby on behalf of musicians rather than educate the
public, so participants went out of their way to make music, not
speeches.</LD>
<TE>   Most simply thanked fans for coming out, or referred briefly to
leveling the playing field with record labels, although Ness told
those who came to the Wiltern to see him, Beck and Pearl Jam singer
Eddie Vedder, "If anyone knows about getting ripped off by a record
company, I do."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Joel made one of the few pointed remarks during the Forum's
five-hour rock bill which also featured the Eagles, Sheryl Crow,
Stevie Nicks and John Fogerty. "This is the just cause," he said
during his 40-minute set. "I used to live out here, and I got signed
to a deal with a company that was sucking my blood for 25 years. I
just don't want that to happen to nobody else, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Fans applauded, but not as loudly as when Tom Hanks strode onstage
to introduce Nicks, amping up the star power. The wattage was pushed
higher yet when Nicks brought an unbilled Tom Petty out. Crow and
Henley also joined Nicks for the most musically interactive portion
of the Forum show.</TE>
<TE>   Crow turned up at Universal during the Dixie Chicks' set,
returning the favor Chicks' singer Natalie Maines provided when she
joined Crow earlier at the Forum. Bluegrass banjo master Earl Scruggs
also appeared with the Chicks on a bill that included Dwight Yoakam,
Emmylou Harris, Trisha Yearwood and Patty Griffin.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,200 people who packed the Wiltern saw a rare solo set by
Vedder that included "Dead Man," a 1996 Pearl Jam rarity, his version
of the Beatles' "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away," from the "I Am
Sam" soundtrack and Pearl Jam's "Parting Ways." He, Ness and Beck
joined one another during successive sets that ran a little more than
three hours. Radiohead singer Thom Yorke made a surprise appearance,
singing the Velvet Underground's "I'm Set Free" with Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Fogerty, whose career was famously sidelined by drawn-out battles
with his record label, returned to the Forum stage he played more
than three decades ago as the leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival,
delivering a handful of CCR hits, plus his 1985 song "Centerfield."</TE>
<TE>   All except the Forum concert sold out in advance, and the Forum
appeared near-capacity Tuesday night, with only a few hundred of its
17,000 seats roped off behind the stage because of restricted sight
lines.</TE>
<TE>   One unusual result was a benefit about which many fans said they
wished they'd been told more during the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew more, I'd care more," said Forum concertgoer Beatrice
Solis, 27, of West Los Angeles. "They should have talked or run tapes
between acts to explain what the issues are."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition's immediate target is the music industry's exemption
from the California law limiting personal service contracts to seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   "The seven-year clause is clearly discriminatory," Offspring
singer Bryan "Dexter" Holland said in advance of his performance at
the Long Beach Arena, along with alt-rockers No Doubt and Weezer. "No
one can be bound to a personal service contract for more than seven
years--except musicians. It wouldn't fly with anyone else that was
organized or unionized."</TE>
<TE>   Coalition members are rallying behind a state bill to repeal that
exemption, SB 1256, sponsored by Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City),
who sat beside Henley, the group's co-founder, at a hastily assembled
press conference backstage at the Forum just before the show began.</TE>
<TE>   Henley quickly set out to refute the characterization of the
Recording Artists Coalition as a group of rock stars simply trying to
make themselves richer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a dog in this fight," Henley said. "As far as I'm
concerned, I've just got to make two more albums and I'm out of here.
And I'm perfectly happy with my contract."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of working musicians, however, can't say the same,
Henley said, because of contract provisions record companies insist
upon, knowing that artists cannot fulfill them, especially the
seven-albums-in-seven-years requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new frontier," said Crow, another driving force behind the
coalition, before Tuesday's concert. "We [musicians] are having to
grow up and be adults and handle these things ourselves. It's not in
the nature of artists to join groups and concentrate on issues or the
business side of our work."</TE>
<TE>   Lines for beer generally were deeper than those at merchandise
booths selling $40 coalition sweat shirts, $20 T-shirts, $10 posters
and lapel pins. The exception was the teen-heavy crowd at Long Beach
Arena, which was snapping up the items at a brisk pace.</TE>
<TE>   Fans surveyed appeared to have a limited grasp of the cause for
which they'd turned out--most said they came for the music.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the bands are mad at the record labels and they don't want
other bands to get ripped off," is how Long Beach 16-year-old Aubry
McDaniel summed up the cause. But mainly, "I came to see Gwen,"
referring to No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani.</TE>

<LD>   "Balto II: Wolf Quest," Universal Studios Home Video. VHS: $14.
DVD: $20. Ages 6 and older. www.balto2.com</LD>
<LD>   Solid storytelling, believable characters, healthy messages about
right and wrong--and about not letting what we are define who we
are--plus eye-filling background art, and music and songs that are a
bit more than the generic pop sound found in today's animated sagas:
This sequel to 1995's "Balto," about the adventures of a heroic
half-wolf dog, is family entertainment with depth.</LD>
<TE>   This time around, it's Balto's daughter, Aleu, who feels like an
outsider among her dog kin--she looks even more like a wolf than her
father. When she realizes that she must find out where she belongs
and what kind of "music sings inside" her, Balto joins her on her
quest. The two are guided by his dream spirits, led by a raven and
Balto's wolf mother, until Aleu finds her destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Phil Weinstein and written by Dev Ross, the film
features a fine voice cast that includes David Carradine, Lacey
Chabert, Mark Hamill, Maurice LeMarche, Jodi Benson and Peter
MacNichol. Inspired by traditional Indian songs and chants, Adam
Berry did the music, with songs by Michele Brourman and Amanda
McBroom. The beautiful art of sky, forest and sea is dramatic and
painterly; background artists are Jonathan Salt, Wei Zhao and Lin
Zheng.</TE>
<TE>   Parents should be aware that some scenes of conflict and
separation from family may resonate too keenly for preschoolers.</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   Donovan: Pied Piper. Music for Little People. CD: $17. Cassette:
$11. (800) 346-4445. Nostalgic adults and ages 3 to 7. www.mflp.com</TE>
<TE>   It may give baby boomers pause to hear 1960s icon Donovan crooning
tunes for children--and, gulp, his grandkids join him on the "People
Call Me the Pied Piper" track--but his peaceful flower-power spirit
works like a charm in such original tunes as the tale-spinning
"Jackie Beanstalk" and the cozy "Little Teddy Bear."</TE>
<TE>   The acoustic instrumentals are fine stuff, and older Donovan fans
will appreciate hearing such classics, their lyrics tailored for
young listeners, as "Happiness Runs," "Little Boy in Corduroy,"
"Colors" and others.</TE>

Ages 3 to 6. www.domdeluise.com</TE>
<TE>   Like a jolly grandpa-next-door type--who wanders off-key when he
sings but does so with undiminished gusto--comedy maestro Dom DeLuise
puts his signature irrepressible stamp on simple, traditional-style
humorous songs for young children, sunnily crooning ditties about
kangaroos and anteaters, a "highfalootin, rootin'-tootin' owl," a
"Piano Playing Mouse" and odes to pizza ("My Favorite Pie") and
vegetables ("Concerto for Veggies").</TE>

<HD>Missteps Undo 'We Are Family'</HD>
<DH>Murray Schisgal's comedy, at the Odyssey, steps over the
line in its tale of two men who 'turn gay.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three failed marriages, Sam is being eaten alive by loneliness
and a sense of failure. Determined to turn his life around, he
decides to be like another group of men who always seem happy and
carefree. So he proposes to an old buddy that they turn gay together.</LD>
<LD>   As a premise for comedy, this could go two ways: It could reveal
essential truths about human nature, inviting recognition and
laughter. Or it could rely on gags that come dangerously close to
offending a couple of core constituencies in its audience: namely,
women and gays. Unfortunately, it takes the second path in Murray
Schisgal's "We Are Family" at the Odyssey Theatre in West Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   If the title sounds familiar, it's because the play was scheduled
at the El Portal Center in North Hollywood, then dumped. Ignoring the
wisdom of that move, the usually smart folks at the Odyssey assembled
an exceptionally talented veteran cast--Allan Miller, Salome Jens,
Alan Blumenfeld and Michael Cavanaugh--to have a go at the script,
under Conrad John Schuck's direction.</LD>
<TE>   As played by Miller, Sam is a man driven by the passion of the
newly converted. "I'm convinced heterosexuality doesn't work
anymore," he tells his strait-laced pal Billy (Cavanaugh).</TE>
<TE>   The reasoning goes something like this: To get the respect they
deserve, women have had to become more aggressive. This has caused a
rift between the sexes, making same-sex company seem more desirable.</TE>
<TE>   Schisgal has goofed around with notions of identity before, most
notably as co-author of the screenplay for "Tootsie." Here, however,
he can't get the tone right. It's never entirely clear whether he's
blaming women and gays for the way things are, or good-naturedly
acknowledging that his straight male characters have brought problems
on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Director Schuck further muddies the waters by writing in his
program notes that Schisgal's plays "are warnings to us, that what
seems normal or logical in the moment could eventually destroy us and
the society we hold so dear." This sounds awfully like those hoary
old claims about feminism and homosexuality destroying the American
way of life.</TE>
<TE>   With the introduction of two more characters in the second act,
the play seems ready to move in a more promising direction.
Blumenfeld has fun inventing coy poses and come-hither looks as a
buddy ready to try Sam's experiment, while Jens demonstrates how a
woman can be both strong and irresistibly sexy.</TE>
<TE>   But Schisgal keeps walking the line of bad taste. And frequently
steps over it.</TE>

<LD>What could be more satisfying than freshly baked cookies?</LD>
<LD>   James' Beach: Filled with walnuts and chocolate chips, these
cookies are baked to order and served warm and gooey, seven or eight
to an order. Have a cappuccino and split a plate with a friend.
(Chocolate chip cookies, $8.) James' Beach, 60 N. Venice Blvd.,
Venice, (310) 823-5396.</LD>
<LD>   the house: Here comes a plate of childhood favorites: a tiny
brownie, a raspberry thumbprint cookie, and peanut butter, oatmeal
and chocolate chip cookies, along with a homemade sucker, fresh
marshmallows, a miniature candy bar, cappuccino bonbons and a pecan
melt-away. And animal crackers that change nightly--you might get a
dragonfly or a rhino! (Plate of cookies and milk, $7.) the house,
5750 Melrose Ave., L.A., (323) 462-4687.</LD>
<TE>   Lucques: This plate features four cookies: a crisp sugar cookie, a
Valrhona chocolate chip, a crunchy but moist gingersnap and an almond
thumbprint cookie flavored with lemon zest. (Plate of cookies, $6.)
Lucques, 8474 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (323) 655-6277.</TE>
<TE>   Sage: Pastry chef Suzanne Schoen changes her cookie lineup weekly,
but you'll always find a couple of her classics, such as chocolate
chip, peanut butter or oatmeal, or a buttery Russian tea cookie or an
almond madeleine. You also might find a maple syrup butter cookie or
a chocolate kringle. (Plate of cookies, $5.) Sage, Eastbluff Center,
2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach, (949) 718-9650.</TE>
<TE>   Michael's: Pastry chef Efren Roberts' cookie plate often includes
a peanut butter cookie, a chocolate chip, a rich sugar cookie and a
lemon bar. You might also find some chocolate-covered fruit, baby
candy bars and a tiny chocolate truffle or creme caramel. In the
center of the plate: a seasonal sorbet (at the moment, strawberry).
(Cookie and confection plate, $8.) Michael's, 1147 3rd St., Santa
Monica, (310) 451-0843.</TE>
<TE>   Barney Greengrass: This sophisticated deli on the fifth floor of
Barneys New York offers a huge choice of cookies, five or six to the
plate: peanut butter, chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin; walnut
biscotti, fudge brownies, Florentines, jelly centers, assorted
rugelach and more, all baked daily on the premises. (Mixed cookies
plate, $5.50.) Barney Greengrass, Barneys New York, 9570 Wilshire
Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 777-5877.</TE>

<HD>Bas-Relief Abstractions Give New Form to Human Emotions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY MYERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeanne Silverthorne's sprawling new exhibition at Shoshana Wayne
Gallery revolves around two seemingly mechanical apparatuses--a Fear
Machine and a Tear Machine (both 2002)--that are connected by pipes
to several thick picture frames, all black.</LD>
<LD>   Within each frame, as though pumped in from a central source, a
waxy, parchment-colored substance appears frozen into a series of
organic bas-relief abstractions resembling (and in some cases
representing) microscopic views of the human body.</LD>
<LD>   With all of the cords, plugs and switches that these contraptions
entail, one expects some sort of electrical output--movement, sound
or a projection, perhaps--but in fact the entire system is made from
cast rubber.</LD>
<TE>   Upon close inspection, the gears, cranks, knobs and joints are
stiff, clotted with sloppy black paint and conspicuously useless.</TE>
<TE>   Thus relieved of any functional obligation, the work reveals
itself to be surprisingly, and somewhat hauntingly, human. In this
light, the machines come to seem rather intimate, like models of a
stranger's internal organs.</TE>
<TE>   The relief works read like materialized emotions. In previous
exhibitions, Silverthorne has titled similar works with a tone of
gritty scientific literalism--Sweat Pore, for example, or Ulcer,
Bacteria Promoting--but here they're called Dry Mouth (2002),
Thin-Skinned (2000), Edgy (2001) and Aching (2001), as if she were
reclaiming the sensations they represent from the impersonal rhetoric
of science.</TE>
<TE>   They're fascinating and sculpturally masterful creations:
simultaneously beautiful and grotesque, delicate and monstrous. They
protrude, crawl, sag and drift with an almost embarrassing compulsion
beyond the interior edges of the frame, like flesh that refuses to be
politely contained by the walls of an undergarment.</TE>
<TE>   At the physical center of the exhibition, in a tall Plexiglas
vitrine, are two small female figures that are cast as reliefs from
the same pale rubber. Identical but for the color of their hastily
applied hair, they sit with their knees drawn toward their chests,
wearing crude but poignant expressions of anxiety. Despite the
discrepancy in scale, it's easy to imagine these figures--surrogates,
perhaps, for the artist or viewer--as the vehicles within which the
larger emotional engines are continually running, producing the tears
and fears that accompany life's many anxieties.</TE>

<LD>Hello Again: The Bocchinos have resurfaced. Their ship (well, the
Santa Monica restaurant they both worked at, Remi) went under in 2001
because of escalating rents. Chris (husband, chef) and Kristine
(wife, consulting pastry chef) have come up for air at the recently
opened Alessi Ristorante in Hollywood. Its owners, Antonio and Sarah
Alessi, remodeled the old L'Angolo space on Melrose Avenue, creating
an Italian restaurant with a main dining room, private dining room,
patio and wine room. There's a separate bar area. The menu of
antipasti, salads, pizzas, pastas, risotto, meat and fish dishes
might include polenta with sauteed mushrooms and thyme ($8),
prosciutto and arugula pizza ($13), butternut squash and Fontina
ravioli ($12), tagliatelle in lamb ragout ($15), striped bass filet
with rapini and fennel gratin ($21), veal scaloppine ($25) and
roasted chicken with preserved lemon sauce ($17). Alessi is open for
dinner Monday-Saturday.</LD>

<TE>   A Second Spark: Danilo Terribili, owner of Alto Palato on La
Cienega Boulevard in L.A., also has his hand in Spark Woodfire
Cooking in Studio City. He and partners Bill Chait, a founder of the
Louise's Trattoria chain, and Jeff Sladicka are sparking up again
with a second Spark in Huntington Beach, and with a third to come.
Says Terribili, "We're looking, as we speak, in Summerlin, [Nev.]."
Tom Shields, formerly chef at the Bungalow in Corona del Mar, will be
the chef of the second Spark, pulling rustic Italian-style pizzas and
meats out of a wood-burning oven. Since the Huntington Beach location
is so much larger than Studio City's, Shields will be able to offer
grilled fish, more meat entrees and more pastas than the Studio City
location can. Entree prices will still fall between $11 and $20, with
sides (e.g., grilled asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted potatoes)
hitting between $2 and $6. The new Spark, when it opens at the end of
March at Pierside Pavilion, will be able to seat about 100 inside and
70 on the terrace. Osvaldo Maiozzi designed it to show a family
resemblance to the Studio City Spark.</TE>

<HD>A Hit in His Day</HD>
<DH>Eddie Cantor repeated Broadway success in a couple of zany
films. His 'Kid Boots' returns to kick up some fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian-singer Eddie Cantor was as beloved an American institution
as his contemporaries Jack Benny and George Burns, and if he isn't as
well-remembered today, it's because he was the first to pass away, in
1964 at age 72. A diminutive dynamo known for his bright, rolling
"banjo eyes," Cantor became a major Florenz Ziegfeld star, and the
legendary impresario transferred two of Cantor's biggest Broadway
hits, "Kid Boots" and "Whoopee!," to the screen.</LD>
<LD>   Singer-songwriter Brian Gari, Cantor's grandson, will present a
rare surviving print of "Kid Boots" (1926) at the Silent Movie Friday
through Sunday at 8 p.m., with matinees Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m.
Whereas "Whoopee!" (1930), an early talkie in two-strip Technicolor,
is virtually a film record of a stage production, "Kid Boots" is a
madcap silent farce, directed by Paramount's ever-reliable Frank
Tuttle, that never betrays its theatrical origins.</LD>
<LD>   As an entertainer who had his greatest success on stage, radio and
TV rather than in films, Cantor proved to be a natural mime and
teamed sensationally well with Clara Bow. An amusingly devised plot
finds feckless tailor Cantor caddying for handsome Lawrence Grey, who
has his reasons to go undercover as a golf pro at a mountain resort,
where Cantor falls for swimming instructor Bow, and Grey for the
resort owner's beautiful daughter (Billie Dove).</LD>
<TE>   Various plot strands come together in a literal cliffhanger, and
"Kid Boots," which Tom Gibson and Luther Reed deftly adapted from the
Otto A. Harbach-William Anthony McGuire play, remains timelessly
hilarious. 611 N. Fairfax Ave., L.A. (323) 665-2520.</TE>
<TE>   Among the films screening at the Egyptian in the American
Cinematheque's ongoing "Recent Spanish Cinema" series is Catalan
director Marc Recha's stunning "Pau and His Brother" (Sunday at 5
p.m.), a work at once economical yet leisurely in pace, a richly
evocative work that attests to Recha's understanding and respect for
the power of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Little is said in the film's first half. A young chef, Pau (David
Selvas), learns that his brother Alex, who went to work on a highway
construction project in the Pyrenees, has inexplicably committed
suicide. He and their equally grief-stricken mother Merce (Alicia
Orozco) journey to the distant, almost deserted town where Alex had
been living at the same time Marta (Nathalie Boutefeu) is heading
there from Toulouse to see her father Emili (Luis Hostalot), who is
Alex's boss and whom she has not seen since she was a small child.
Also on her way is Sara (Marieta Orozco), Alex's beautiful
girlfriend, who had been waiting for him to return.</TE>
<TE>   Recha recalls the early films of Stan Brakhage in his joyous
reverence for nature--they both understand the glory of natural
light--as well as Michelangelo Antonioni in his willingness to hold a
shot to allow its beauty and meaning to sink in. Another Antonioni
echo is in his elliptical style. Beyond learning that Alex became
increasingly depressed while working on the highway, perhaps seeing
it as a violation of a region of unspoiled natural beauty, we never
know why he took his life.</TE>
<TE>   The point for Recha is that in the face of death the best thing to
do is to celebrate life, the closer to nature the better--which is
what these attractive, likable people do, with tenderness and
exuberance. "Pau and His Brother." Lloyd E. Rigler Theater at the
Egyptian, 6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the UCLA Film Archives' annual "Contemporary Latin
American Films" series gets underway Saturday with Alfonso Cuaron's
"Y Tu Mama Tambien," a box office smash and yet another major work
that attests to the rebirth of the Mexican cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron casts a satirical eye on a rapidly changing society as two
youths, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his best friend Julio (Gael Garcia
Bernal), take off on an impromptu summer holiday with the lovely
Luisa (Maribel Verdu), wife of Tenoch's cousin, a pompous,
philandering intellectual. This is a classic coming-of-age tale, with
a pair of brash but likable teenagers learning about sex and life
from a wise and sophisticated older woman, but it is told with
uncommon depth and wide-ranging implications. It screens at 7:30 p.m.
in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater, UCLA campus. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   Apollo Cinema presents a program of the Oscar-nominated
live-action and animated shorts beginning tonight at 7:30 at the
Monica 4-Plex, where it will run as two separate 70-minute segments
at 11 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays through April.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Cordell Barker's "Strange Invaders," an unsettling and
venturesome tale of a childless couple whose yearning for parenthood
has unforeseen consequences, the animation nominees are
unexceptional.</TE>
<TE>   The live-action category, however, holds two standouts. Virgil
Widrich's witty, surreal "Copy Shop," which concerns the dire
consequences that result when a copy shop proprietor accidentally
places his hand in his copier machine.</TE>
<TE>   Slawomir Fabicki and Bogumil Gofrejow's "A Man Thing" is a
harrowing, sensitively wrought vignette about a 13-year-old boy who
is trapped between a brutal, abusive father and a soccer coach who
insists that the youth play at the expense of his studies. 1332 2nd
St., Santa Monica. (310) 394-9741.</TE>
<TE>   On May 7, 2000, a 65-year-old white woman was shot at a
Jacksonville, Fla., Ramada Inn by a black man, in front of her
husband. At about the same time, 15-year-old Benton Butler was
passing by, on his way to fill out a job application at a Blockbuster
store. The husband, later seeing the boy in the back seat of a police
car, identified him as his wife's murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Xavier de Lestrade's Oscar-nominated documentary, "Murder on
a Sunday Morning," begins a one-week run of daily 10:30 a.m. showings
Friday at the Sunset 5. As Lestrade follows public defenders Patrick
McGuinness and Ann Finnell preparing for Butler's trial, his film
develops the suspense and tension of a classic fictional courtroom
drama. "Murder on a Sunday Morning" soon becomes all the more
riveting because it is the real thing: a step-by-step probe of the
American justice system and what it reveals about our society under
pressure. 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. (323) 848-3500.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forrest J. Ackerman settles into a chair in his Los Feliz living room
and offers his guests seating on a lime green shag carpet that looks
trampled by decades of visitors. The room is packed with 50 strangers
who have accepted the sci-fi legend's invitation to spend an hour
prowling through his collection of more than 300,000 pieces of
science fiction and horror memorabilia.</LD>
<LD>   Ackerman's collection contains the only remaining model of a
Martian flying saucer from 1953's "War of the Worlds," a 69-year-old
stegosaurus model from "King Kong" and the ring Bela Lugosi wore in
"Dracula." But it's 85-year-old Ackerman who brings the collection to
life.</LD>
<LD>   He is the literary agent who gave Ray Bradbury his first break.
His horror magazines and comic book monsters inspired filmmakers John
Landis and Steven Spielberg. He seems to have endless, and
little-known, stories about horror greats like Basil Rathbone and
Boris Karloff.</LD>
<TE>   His home is now called Ackermansion and serves as a sort of museum
in exile. A personal obsession open to the public. And Ackerman is
not alone. Southern California has a museum subculture that exists
outside the mainstream. Scattered around the city are manifestations
of unique passions, bizarre visions and warped senses of humor in the
form of shrines to bunnies, cakes, celebrity underwear and movie
lighting.</TE>
<TE>   It is a weird, fluid, unpredictable world. Most of these museums
exist without established hours or serious financial backing. Only a
few charge admission. Survival is uncertain. The Punk Rock Museum in
Silver Lake faded from the scene in 2000. A year later, Carole and
Barry Kaye's Museum of Miniatures closed, despite a prime location on
L.A.'s museum-packed Miracle Mile. Hollywood's Museum of Death
remains in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how we look at it. The building that was housing it was
just a shell, kind of like a person," Museum of Death's co-founder
J.D. Healy said of the dispute with the landlord that prompted its
closure last summer. "And when they die, that doesn't mean their soul
dies. The soul can continue. So that's the attitude we're going with.
It's not like it's lost or going away. It's just on the back burner
... until the stars are aligned in the proper direction."</TE>
<TE>   For the curious, there's a moral here: Visit these strange museums
while you can.</TE>
<TE>   14,000 Bunny-Related</TE>
<TE>   Items, and Counting</TE>
<TE>   Candace Frazee traces the Bunny Museum's history to Valentines Day
1993, when her husband, Steve Lubanski, gave Candace a standard-issue
plush white rabbit. She bought him a ceramic bunny that Easter. And
so on.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there are more than 14,000 bunny-related objects--ranging
from salt shakers to parts of Rose Parade floats--all crammed into
their 1,500-square-foot house in Pasadena. The collection spills into
their garage and front and back yards.</TE>
<TE>   What's possibly more interesting than the collection is how the
couple manage their lives in a house that's wall-to-wall bunny stuff
(plus six live rabbits). The effect is eye-popping.</TE>
<TE>   "Step into our warren. We only have stuffed bunnies in here,"
Frazee said. The "warren" is her den, or it used to be a den, anyway.
Now it is packed floor to ceiling with plush bunnies. Squeezed in
between on a little patch of floor are a futon and a coffee table. A
television peeks out between ears and whiskers.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the house is equally packed and meticulously
categorized by type, activity and name. There are kissing bunnies,
Mexican bunnies, bunny silverware and china. Bugs Bunny, the most
famous rabbit, is relegated to the garage due to prolific
merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling how many rabbits someone can collect and live
in the same space with them," said Shannon Cohen of Arcadia, one of
5,600 people who have visited the museum since it opened in 1998. "I
do think it's sweet how they give each other bunnies every day."
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is the largest
bunny collection on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete Creations</TE>
<TE>   at Pierce College</TE>
<TE>   In a deserted little park on the Los Angeles Pierce College
campus, the Old Trapper's concrete creations--weirdly
disproportionate and eternally unhappy--stand like refugees from the
Twilight Zone. There's Big Foot Brown half buried in his Boot Hill
grave. Peg Leg Smith and Chief Big Bear are frozen in mortal combat,
each man with a weapon buried in his foe. Their blood is bright red
thanks to a fresh coat of paint. And poor Clementine, the Miner
Forty-Niner's daughter, reclines in such an improbable pose, it makes
your back hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The bizarre Wild West tableau is the inspiration of the late John
Ehn, a Sun Valley eccentric who called himself the "Old Trapper." He
spent the last 30 years of his life sculpting the tall figures and a
Boot Hill cemetery, which he arranged around his home. When Ehn died
in 1981, his family got a state historic designation for the statues.
The figures were transplanted to the Woodland Hills college in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   According to California Historical Marker No. 939, the sculptures
represent a "remarkable 20th century folk art environment." It's the
kind of art that proliferated and perished with the roadside
attractions on isolated stretches of Route 66. Their current home in
a forgotten park, tucked behind the college agriculture department,
is almost always deserted. Only a few wary cows and an occasional fan
of roadside kitsch keep watch over the Old Trapper's creations.</TE>
<TE>   Lingerie Museum Has</TE>
<TE>   Famous Undergarments</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Phyllis Diller dubbed Frederick's of Hollywood Lingerie
Museum the "Museum of Unnatural History." Tucked in the back of the
Hollywood Boulevard Frederick's of Hollywood store, the museum hosts
a small collection of famous undergarments ranging from Madonna's
"Who's That Girl" tasseled bustier to one of cross-dressing Milton
Berle's costumes.</TE>
<TE>   The museum begins to tap its potential with historical footnotes
such as a Keyhole Secrets catalog that details what was naughty in
1948. "Is he a bosom man?" asks one ad for the "perfect curve coaxer"
bra. Then there's the gold-plated patent for the strapless bra that's
not a bra.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the titillating subject matter and the famous brand
name, this shrine to unmentionables is surprisingly tame. Maybe it's
just the way they're displayed--sealed behind cold glass and devoid
of the famous forms that made them more than underwear. Without a
devoted eccentric to serve as curator and docent, it's just a
collection of fading fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Cakes Not Smaller,</TE>
<TE>   but the Museum Is</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Frances Kuyper, also known as the Cake Lady, found
herself with a spare house, an ailing husband who needed her close to
home and a divine vision of a museum devoted to the art and style of
cake decorating.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I should have a museum to teach people about cakes from
around the world," said Kuyper, 83. "Mostly, it was for young people.
I wanted to spread the word to children and teenagers that cake
decorating is a wonderful profession."</TE>
<TE>   Things have never quite worked out as expected for the Cake Lady,
yet somehow they still worked out. Her story is more interesting than
her collection of 150 cakes featured in the Mini Cake Museum, unless
you're looking to master the physics of frosting. She can tell you
about that, too.</TE>
<TE>   Kuyper opened the museum in her Pasadena guest house in 1994 after
retiring from several decades on the international cake decorating
circuit. She tried and failed to persuade corporate sponsors to build
a museum, so she built it herself with $60,000 in savings.</TE>
<TE>   Her collection showcases techniques from airbrushing to cake
shaping (hint: Rice Krispy treats mold nicely) to the difficult art
of rolled fondant icing, an Australian delicacy that turns to cement
if the cake underneath is not moist enough. When her husband died in
1998, Kuyper moved to the Hollenbeck Home, a retirement community in
Boyle Heights. The cake museum moved with her, although the movers
crushed part of the collection--hence the new "mini" moniker. The 150
cakes reside behind glass in the basement.</TE>
<TE>   Exploring the Depths</TE>
<TE>   of the Ackermansion</TE>
<TE>   Meandering through Ackerman's house, a man has stumbled across the
object of his childhood nightmares sitting on a cluttered shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd see 'The Tingler.' I even touched it," he
says of the 1959 horror prop from the movie of the same name. That's
how it is here, pieces of horror classics scattered in every corner.
People are free to touch and browse--despite the occasional thief.
Ackerman had hoped his collection would be in a museum by now, but
official plans fizzled back in the '80s and private backers never
emerged. So, on most Saturdays, Ackerman leads a string of visitors
through the cluttered halls of his 17-room Los Feliz home.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no use being that old geezer up on the hill that has all
this wonderful stuff, but won't let anyone look at it," said
Ackerman, explaining why he's opened his doors to the public. "The
enjoyment I get out of this is worth more than losing the occasional
item. Besides, it's like trying to drain the ocean with a sieve-you
can't get it all."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman is friendly, a little corny and totally disarming. He
invites guests to try on Dracula's ring or flip through his endless
library of horror magazines. He flirts with women he recruits to act
out scenes from horror classics.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected this old house with this old character in it, but this
is actually very cool," said Michelle Swinney of San Clemente, who
brought her husband to see Ackerman's "War of the Worlds" spacecraft.
At the end of the tour and stories, Ackerman speaks with everyone who
wants to talk, even as the open house extends beyond the one-hour
time limit. No one leaves without an autograph. He seems as unwilling
for the strangers to leave as they are to go.</TE>
<TE>   When only a few hangers-on remain, Ackerman claps his hands and

<HD>'Jay and Silent Bob' Is an Inside Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Kevin Smith has never met a dirty word he didn't like. And
he seems to have used them all in his five films: "Clerks,"
"Mallrats," "Chasing Amy," "Dogma" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back."</LD>
<LD>   But at least "Clerks" and "Chasing Amy" were good movies. "Jay and
Silent Bob Strike Back," described in the press release as the
"hilarious, star-studded finale" of the adventures of the stoned duo
introduced in "Clerks," is just one big disgusting frat party played
out as a feature film. If gross-out humor is your raison d'etre, then
you will enjoy the two-disc DVD special edition (Dimension, $30).
This digital edition even features some deleted scenes that go so far
over the taste line that if they hadn't been cut, they would have
earned the film an NC-17 rating rather than an R.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Mewes plays the tall, thin, drugged-out Jay while Smith is
the quiet, rotund Silent Bob in this comedy, which finds the duo
leaving their New Jersey environs and heading for Hollywood when they
learn a film is being made of Bluntman and Chronic--comic book
characters that are based on them. Also starring in the film are Will
Ferrell and Shannon Elizabeth. The cameos by Jon Stewart, Ben
Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek and Mark Hamill
are the only things amusing about the film.</LD>
<TE>   The DVD features commentary from Smith, producer Scott Mosier and
Mewes, who seems totally out of it. In fact, Smith keeps telling him
to face the microphone when he talks. Smith acknowledges that this is
a $20-million inside movie, because unless you have seen his other
films, most of the plot points in "Jay and Silent Bob" are
meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, Mosier, Mewes and even Smith's baby daughter, Harley,
introduce all the extras on the discs, including numerous deleted
scenes, a gag reel, still galleries, two music videos, a
behind-the-scenes featurette, talent files and a "Reel Comedy"
special that aired on Comedy Central.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Mosier also produced "Drawing Flies," a 1995 Canadian
comedy finally getting a release, albeit on DVD ($20) and VHS ($15)
from IndieDVD. This "lost" film from Smith's View Askew production
company was filmed right after "Mallrats," when Smith negotiated a
fund in his contract with Miramax to support two undiscovered
filmmakers a year. Directed by Malcolm Ingram and Matt Gissing,
"Drawing Flies" isn't great, but at least it's unusual. And it
doesn't wear out its welcome.</TE>
<TE>   The plot: Several slackers living in Vancouver, Canada, are taken
off welfare. Broke and unwilling to get jobs, they hike into the
woods to live in a remote cabin to save money. In reality, though,
their guide (Jason Lee) is searching for Bigfoot. Besides Lee, the
black-and-white comedy is filled with such Smith regulars as Mewes,
Renee Humphrey and Carmen Lee. Smith even makes a cameo appearance as
Silent Bob.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition features an introduction by Mosier and Smith,
a director's cut with integrated deleted scenes, deleted scenes,
bloopers, outtakes and rather worthless commentary from the cast,
Mosier and Smith.</TE>
<TE>   It may be hard to believe that a hard-core rap artist would blush
while kissing a famous movie star, but on the audio commentary track
of the horror film "Bones" (New Line, $25), director Ernest Dickerson
says that Snoop Dogg did just that when it came time to kiss his
leading lady, Pam Grier.</TE>
<TE>   Although this thriller about a '70s street hustler (Dogg)
accidentally brought back from the dead 22 years after his murder,
isn't very scary, the DVD is pretty entertaining thanks to the disc's
two documentaries, "Digging Up 'Bones,'" which looks at the genesis
of the project, and "Urban Gothic: 'Bones' and Its Influences," which
examines the horror films of Italian director Mario Bava. The disc
includes the wide-screen version of the film, the trailer, two Snoop
Dogg videos, and serviceable commentary from Dickerson and
screenwriter Adam Simon. But Snoop Dogg, who is also on the
commentary track, is about as scintillating as Mewes.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's made-for-video sequels of its classic animated films have
been a mixed bag. That's the case with "Cinderella II: Dreams Come
True" ($26 for VHS; $30 for DVD), the sequel to the studio's 1950
classic.</TE>
<TE>   Chronicling what happened "happily ever after" to Cinderella and
Prince Charming, "Cinderella II" does have its charms, thanks to the
original's scene-stealers--the adorable French mice Jaq, Gus Gus and
Mary, the mischievous cat Lucifer and the Fairy Godmother.</TE>
<TE>   The human characters, however, aren't very interesting. And
sometimes, the animation just doesn't seem up to the Disney standard.</TE>
<TE>   The movie features four new songs performed in a Britney Spears
style by Brooke Allison, as well as a hideous updated version of the
"Cinderella" standard: "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a featurette on how the music was composed for
the film, a music video, a storybook read by Juliet Mills and an
interactive game, "Cinderella's Enchanted Castle Activity."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, now. The first season of Garry Shandling's seminal HBO comedy
series "The Larry Sanders Show" is making its DVD debut in a
three-disc set ($50) from Columbia TriStar. The series about a
neurotic late-night talk show host is just as perceptive, adult and
funny as it was when it debuted on the cable network a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the 13 episodes, the disc includes the enjoyable "Garry
Shandling Talks ... No Flipping," a recent interview with Shandling
conducted by Washington Post critic Tom Shales, who once had a cameo
appearance in the series. Shandling talks about the inception of the
series, how it evolved over the first season, and the casting of
Jeffrey Tambor as Sanders' sidekick, Hank Kingsley, and Rip Torn as
the show's producer, Artie.</TE>
<TE>   The series also starred Penny Johnson, Wallace Langham, Janeane
Garofalo, Megan Gallagher and Jeremy Piven.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Anderson, who directed the charming comedy "Next Stop
Wonderland," goes the horror movie route with the thriller "Session
9" (USA, $27), starring David Caruso. The psychological thriller
revolves around a five-man crew given just one week to remove
asbestos from an abandoned, crumbling mental hospital. In the
tradition of "And Then There Were None," crew members are picked off
one by one by some unknown person or phantom.</TE>
<TE>   The interesting digital edition includes the wide-screen version
of the film, deleted scenes--mostly those involving a discarded
subplot about a homeless woman living in the hospital--and the
alternative ending with commentary by Anderson. There also are
storyboards, the trailer and a creepy documentary on the real
abandoned mental hospital used in the film. Anderson supplies the
rather laid-back commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Haiku Tunnel," which makes its DVD bow this week (Columbia
TriStar, $30), is a slight but amusing comedy about a temporary
worker (Josh Kornbluth) who discovers his unstructured lifestyle
unraveling when he agrees to go "perm" at a San Francisco law firm.
Kornbluth, who resembles a young Zero Mostel, also produced, co-wrote
and directed the indie film with his brother, Jacob Kornbluth.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features the wide-screen edition of the comedy, talent
files, outtakes (which aren't very funny), deleted scenes and
pleasant commentary from the Kornbluth brothers. One interesting
factoid: Josh Kornbluth's wife made all the outrageous Hawaiian
shirts he wears in the film.</TE>

<HD>Dave Weckl Takes Center Stage</HD>
<DH>The virtuosic drummer often overwhelms his bandmates at the
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drummers have been bandleaders from virtually the beginning of jazz
history--think Ben Pollack, Chick Webb and Gene Krupa, to name a few.
Some surrounded themselves with first-rate talent capable of being
sparked into action by the drumming. Others placed their own playing
at the focal point of attention.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who walked into Catalina Bar &amp; Grill Tuesday night had
little difficulty in anticipating which of those options to expect
from the Dave Weckl Band.</LD>
<LD>   In the position of honor, at center stage, occupying two thirds of
the space (the grand piano had been removed), was Weckl's enormous
drum set. Shimmering with cymbals of every size (including a stacked
pair), a multiplicity of percussion, from snare, tom-toms and double
bass drums to bongos and the Middle Eastern djimbe, it was a
percussionist's dream come true.</LD>
<TE>   Around the fringe of the drums--like satellites orbiting a
dominant planet--were positions for saxophone and woodwinds (played
by Brandon Fields), bass (Tom Kennedy) and keyboards (Steve
Weingart). And their positioning accurately reflected how the set's
music would unfold.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was ample space for soloing from the other players,
they did so to the accompaniment of a barrage of drum and cymbal
sounds filling every vestige of musical space around them.</TE>
<TE>   Fields' passionate tenor saxophone playing often managed to crest
above the torrent of percussion, but Kennedy and Weingart--both
superb players--generally found their individual choruses surfacing
only as a backdrop for Weckl's drumming.</TE>
<TE>   The single relatively laid-back number in the set, an original by
Weckl and Weingart titled "Passion," provided an opportunity to
finally hear the first-rate individual skills of all the musicians,
their smoothly integrated ensemble work, and--most importantly--a
sense of how compelling a player Weckl can be when he allows some
space in his drumming.</TE>
<TE>   In his gigs with other artists, Weckl takes a far less dominant
role, usually playing with considerably more subtle musicality. For
this week's run at Catalina's, however, it is his remarkable, if
overwhelming, technical virtuosity that is dominating the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   The Dave Weckl Band at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga
Blvd. Tonight at 8  and 10, $16 cover; Friday at 8:30 p.m., and
Sunday at 7:30 p.m., $18 cover; Friday at 10:30 p.m. and Sunday at

<LD>   And Then There Were Three 'Rings' Producers</LD>
<LD>   Settling a credits controversy that foreshadowed next month's
Oscar presentation, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences has
officially dropped one of four producers who could have been eligible
to receive statuettes should New Line Cinema's sprawling fantasy
epic, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," be named
best picture. According to academy rules, no more than three
producers can be nominated or receive statuettes.</LD>
<TE>   Director Peter Jackson, co-screenwriter Frances Walsh and producer
Barrie M. Osborne--all listed as producers of the film--were ruled
eligible by the academy. Removed from the list was New Zealand
producer Tim Sanders, a longtime friend and colleague of Jackson and
Walsh, who left the production three months into its 15-month shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan Ponders Taking a Role on the Big Screen</TE>
<TE>   Music legend Bob Dylan, buoyed by a resurgence in his career, is
in talks for what would be his first major film role in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The 60-year-old singer would star as Jack Fate, a wandering
troubadour who is brought out of prison by his former manager for one
last concert. Dylan would perform his own music in the film.</TE>
<TE>   The Intermedia Films drama, tentatively titled "Masked &amp;
Anonymous," is the directorial debut of writer-director-producer
Larry Charles, whose credits include TV's "Mad About You" and
"Seinfeld."</TE>
<TE>   The project is due to go into production in July.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Elaine, er, 'Ellie,' Makes a Decent Ratings Splash</TE>
<TE>   Julia Louis-Dreyfus' new sitcom, ''Watching Ellie,'' premiered to
strong ratings Tuesday, with an estimated audience of 16.7 million
sampling the show, second to CBS' ''JAG'' in its time slot.</TE>
<TE>   NBC sandwiched the comedy between ''Frasier'' reruns and promoted
it heavily during the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The tally for the premiere surpassed initial ratings for two
previous sitcoms featuring former ''Seinfeld'' co-stars: ''The
Michael Richards Show'' (which debuted to 13.2 million viewers in
October 2000) and the Jason Alexander vehicle ''Bob Patterson'' (9.8
million last year).</TE>
<TE>   Viewership of those programs subsequently dropped, and each was
canceled in its first season.</TE>
<TE>   Network Responds to Sorkin's Comments</TE>
<TE>   NBC said Tuesday that it stands by Aaron Sorkin's right to speak
his mind, after "The West Wing" creator's comments in this week's New
Yorker. Sorkin said the country and the media are pretending that
President Bush is competent and brave, and he called Tom Brokaw's
recent White House special a "valentine."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we respect Aaron's right to say whatever he thinks,"
NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker said in a conference call
with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We would never get in the way of his right to speak his mind. The
only place we disagreed with him was about Tom Brokaw. He was just
wrong when he said Tom let [Bush] pad the schedule with events. Aaron
and Tom spoke last night. Aaron apologized to Tom."</TE>
<TE>   NBC did not chastise Sorkin, added Zucker, who at one time
produced Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKE</TE>
<TE>   Robert Downey Jr. is set to star in a remake of the BBC series,
"The Singing Detective." Shooting starts in April.</TE>

<HD>'Onegin' Impersonated</HD>
<DH>Opera Pacific show appears true to Tchaikovky, fails to
capture his soul.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the opera, "Eugene Onegin," love is true, but it never works. The
lovers' timing is wrong and, in Tchaikovsky's world, fate shows no
pity. Aloof, patronizing Onegin rebuffs the girlish crush of
vulnerable, romantic Tatyana, who writes of her infatuation in a
letter to him. There is too much poetry in her, too little in him.</LD>
<LD>   Earnestly romantic Lensky cannot endure carefree Olga's frivolous
dancing with Onegin. In this couple, there is too much poetry in him,
too little in her. The results are tragic--Lensky dies in a duel
between the men. Onegin's recognition of his love for Tatyana comes
too late. Once married and a sophisticated woman of society, she can
no longer honor her affections for the now vulnerable Onegin.</LD>
<LD>   Tchaikovsky lived life infatuated by vulnerable women--they are
regular heroines in his work--but in love with men. As he adapted
Pushkin's poem, "Eugene Onegin," to the lyric stage, he tried to live
it as well, marrying an admirer who wrote to him. The marriage was
brief and disastrous. After three weeks, it just about drove him mad.
He attempted suicide.</LD>
<TE>   The greatness of "Onegin," Tchaikovsky's most popular opera, is
that the composer identifies with the inner lives of all the
characters. He shows exquisite sympathy for Tatyana yet suffers
Onegin's anguish. He desires Olga's light heart but is as needy and
possessive as Lensky.</TE>
<TE>   The new production of "Eugene Onegin," mounted Tuesday night by
Opera Pacific  at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, appears
true to Tchaikovsky. It is meant to look Russian and, sung in the
original language, to sound Russian.</TE>
<TE>   But it does little to capture Tchaikovsky's soul. The stage
designs by Pier Luigi Samaritani are pretty pictures of the old
country. Tatyana's estate is reminiscent of pictures of the house in
which the composer grew up.</TE>
<TE>   The duel is fought on a wintry river bank; the oval proscenium and
the painted backdrop make it look like one of those snow globes you
shake. Prince Gremin, who marries Tatyana, seems to own a suitably
grand ballroom; we see a corner of it.</TE>
<TE>   But no one is home in production. Perhaps director Colin Graham,
who has had a long and distinguished career that goes back to working
with Benjamin Britain, found little to work with in the cast, because
most of what is telling on stage are small details. Mary Mills sings
Tatyana effectively, she has a healthy, impressive soprano. Her
costumes (credited to Malabar Inc.) and dignified manner help her
make the transition from lively girl to a married woman who has
closed off her emotions, but she accomplishes that transition with
what seems like an all-American determination rather than Russian
fatalism. From the start, she seems always in control.</TE>
<TE>   Lucio Gallo's Onegin might have walked stiffly out of an early
19th century Italian opera, stock gestures and all. He is properly
aloof when he meets Tatyana, properly shaken when he shoots Lensky,
properly agitated when he falls in love with Tatyana. But a loud,
bland baritone, he attracts no attention, has no air of mystery.</TE>
<TE>   But then, he has little to play off. Next to Hugh Smith's
galumphing Lensky, Elizabeth Batton is a relatively frisky Olga.
Silvia Vasquez (Larina), Josepha Gayer (Filipievna), Eric Halfvarson
(Gremin) and Chad Berlinghieri (Triquet) are dutiful.</TE>
<TE>   The cast might well have come more to life with a conductor who
did. But Stephen Lord, the music director of Boston Lyric Opera and
Opera Theatre of St. Louis, phrased squarely and showed little flair
for expressive details. Singing in English translation might have
helped as well; the Russian was mush. Neither orchestra nor chorus
offered its best.</TE>
<TE>   This is what we used to expect from Opera Pacific, before John
DeMain became its music director. But in the last two seasons, the
company has become interesting. With DeMain guest conducting at New
York City Opera, maybe there really is no one home in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Eugene Onegin" repeats tonight, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
and Sunday at 2 p.m. (with Maria Kanyova singing Tatyana on Friday
and Sunday), $25-$175, Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town
Center Drive, Costa Mesa, (800) 346-7372.</TE>

<HD>Good-Guy Bridges Is a Winner</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Viewers of "The Agency" (10 p.m., CBS) tonight will probably like the
show's newest series regular--three-time Emmy winner Beau Bridges.
But will they like him too much?</LD>
<LD>   The CIA drama is setting up a rivalry between Bridges' character,
newly named agency director Tom Gage, and his predecessor, Robert
Quinn (Daniel Benzali of "Murder One"). However, there is no
mistaking who we're supposed to think should be in charge.</LD>
<LD>   Gage is folksy and decent. Quinn is smirking and devious. CBS is
counting on our interest in seeing whether the good guy or the bad
guy wins out, but it might be even more interesting if Bridges' good
guy were a little less good.</LD>
<TE>   In his first day on the job, Gage is prepared to handle all
challenges with competence, style and grace. It's still early, of
course, but the only mystery to Gage is why this former U.S. senator
hasn't been elected president. Quinn vs. Gage is Goofus vs. Gallant.</TE>
<TE>   Few will argue with the casting. Bridges and fellow new arrival
Benzali are charismatic additions to an ensemble already filled with
such film and TV veterans as Gil Bellows, Rocky Carroll, David
Clennon, Will Patton, Gloria Reuben and Paige Turco.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's episode, "Sleeping Dogs Lie," presents two story lines
with a fair amount of complexity and intrigue. If at least one of
those attributes were to become part of Bridges' role, without
necessarily diminishing his "good guy" status, the CIA of "The
Agency" might do viewers even more of a service.</TE>

<LD>"Colombia's Patience Ends" (editorial, Feb. 22) rightly describes the
right-wing paramilitaries as thugs hired by the rich. But those
paramilitaries, who carry out 70% to 80% of Colombia's political
killings and torture, are not simply a third element. Reports of
paramilitary atrocities in many parts of Colombia show close
cooperation between the paramilitaries and the government's armed
forces. In some cases they are the same people.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Castano, leader of the paramilitaries' umbrella
organization, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, has welcomed U.S.
military aid. Last year the U.S. State Department added the AUC to
the list of terrorist organizations. But actions speak louder than
words.</LD>
<LD>   In Colombia, human rights are violated by both sides of the war.
U.S. military aid favors the side that kills the most Colombian
civilians but supports the U.S. economic policy. Our leaders need to
rethink their priorities.</LD>

<TE>   "U.S. Debating Wider Assault on Colombia Rebels" (Feb. 23) quoted
a researcher's view that expanded U.S. military intervention "would
reflect the [Bush] administration's view that the insurgents are a
threat beyond Colombia's borders."</TE>
<TE>   I believe this is what is called a self-fulfilling prophecy.
President Bush's Pentagon seems to be demanding a South American
rerun of the Reagan administration's misguided Vietnamization of
Central America. Dumb idea! Don't enough armed nuts hate us for our
imperial overstretch already, without our going out and cultivating
new enemies?</TE>

<HD>Censoring Bush's Speech Shows China's Weakness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision to cut out half of President Bush's speech at Qinghua
University in Beijing was not likely decided by the management in the
New China News Agency ("China Censors Bush Speech in Print," Feb.
23). The order must have come down from the top. Chinese authorities
know quite well that the printed media are the most popular mass
media in China. They are fully aware of the consequence of allowing
the People's Daily, with 14 million circulation, to report Bush's
message extolling America's civic spirit and its status as a beacon
of hope for people around the world. To the leaders of Communist
China, poorly informed citizens are easy prey for demagogues and
tyrants. The Chinese leadership intends for people to live with the
"China village syndrome" so it can fuel unabashed nationalism to prop
up its regime.</LD>
<LD>   The censorship of Bush's speech is a good indication that Chinese
authorities lack the capacity to adjust to external changes. It seems
that the Communist totalitarian regime in China, as efficient and
successful as it may seem on the surface, is really as brittle as a
dead tree in a hurricane.</LD>

<LD>Re "Priest Vows to Fight Sexual Abuse Charge," Feb. 26: Hooray for
Father D. George Spagnolia! It is about time a priest or deacon who
is being maligned by his bishop gets some coverage. It's interesting
that the bishop in Boston presumes to have the ability to determine
who is guilty of a crime before the judicial system makes a
determination. And then, to compound his arrogance, suspends someone
who has given his life to the church while denying him due process.</LD>
<LD>   Father Spagnolia will succeed in obtaining due process and, I
hope, vindication. He will also have to take this to Rome. I did it
and Rome agreed with me.</LD>
<LD>   When is The Times going to look at the issue of wrongly accused,
innocent people being mistreated by the church in Los Angeles and
Southern California?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your article, David Clohessy says that it is worse to be
molested than to be falsely accused of child abuse. I don't see it. A
priest or a teacher who is falsely accused has to wait a year for his
name to be cleared and will have to live with the accusation for the
rest of his life. Can he ever get another comparable job?</TE>
<TE>   What can a priest do when he has been trained for interaction with
people? Are we going to accept false accusations and even possibly
invite them, as the price to pay for discovering actual cases of
child abuse? Cardinal Joseph Bernadin of Chicago was falsely accused.
He had the status and means to rebut his accuser, but how can an
innocent pastor defend himself?</TE>

<LD>Before we wrap up the Olympic Games and ship them off into history,
we need to include a balance sheet of sorts. I offer this:</LD>
<LD>   Cons: Salt Lake City selection scandal; fuss over endorsements;
drug accusations; Russia's denouncement of a second gold medal in
pair skating, then demand for a second gold in women's figure
skating; Russia's charge of bias in freestyle aerial skiing, ice
dancing, cross-country and skiing; South Korea's charge in speed
skating.</LD>
<LD>   Pros: Athletes from many diverse cultures all competing under the
majesty of the American flag. Consider Derek Parra, Vonetta Flowers,
Apolo Anton Ohno, Jennifer Rodriguez, Jim Shea Jr., Sarah Hughes,
Tristan Gale, Lea Ann Parsley. At one time and place athletes from 78
countries coming together, after years of training and sacrifice, to
compete with fierce pride, the only judgment being on the quality and
excellence of their performance.</LD>
<TE>   The pros win for forging lasting friendships between countries,
providing inspiration for young people everywhere and for lighting
the fire within us all.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"On Warming, Bush Is Out of Step" (Opinion, Feb. 24), criticizing
President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, overlooks two
essential points: 1) The treaty places CO2 emission restrictions on
advanced nations only, while exempting so-called developing nations.
Accordingly, it allows an industrial giant such as China, a nation
with an "I don't care" attitude toward the environment, to continue
its unrestrained desecration of the atmosphere; and 2) despite news
coverage to the contrary, a consensus does not exist among scientists
as to whether global warming is a verifiable phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   Some may scoff at this, but confirmation is not too much to ask
prior to implementing the far-reaching and costly restrictions set
forth in the Kyoto treaty. Perhaps a publicly aired debate between
qualified scientists of both persuasions would clear the air of
information pollution and reduce the warming of global tempers.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While the majority of people on death row are undoubtedly not
innocent, as Joshua Marquis suggests in his Feb. 26 commentary, he is
being disingenuous when he compares apples and oranges in his final
sentence. Marquis says we have more to fear from the guilty going
free than from the innocents who are wrongly imprisoned--but we are
not talking about the innocent being imprisoned, we are talking about
executing them.</LD>
<LD>   Turning the adage on its head that it is better to free 100 guilty
men than imprison one innocent man, Marquis suggests that it's not
really such a bad idea to keep a few innocents in prison, or even to
execute them, so long as it prevents a few guilty men from being
freed. Have we really come that far from the ideals of the founding
fathers?</LD>

<TE>   Marquis cheers on the death penalty while minimizing errors in our
judicial system. Meanwhile, on the front page an article informs us
that half the examiners are unable to positively identify
fingerprints reliably. First eyewitness reliability was called into
question; now fingerprints. What in our justice system can we trust
to assure that true justice is carried out?</TE>

<LD>After reading "L.A. Settles 7 Rampart Cases for $2.8 Million" (Feb.
20), it's evident that police framing scandals are still a big-time
problem in this nation. Just this one Rampart Division has cost
taxpayers $35 million. I'd love to see an article on the burden put
on taxpayers for this type of police abuse on a nationwide basis. It
must be staggering.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Disputes Long-Term Power Pacts," Feb. 25: I have never
begrudged athletes who are rewarded with multimillion-dollar
contracts for playing sports on the professional level. At the same
time, I have neither respect nor empathy for players who sign
long-term contracts to ensure financial security for themselves and
then, when they have outstanding seasons or discover other players
are making more money, refuse to honor their signatures and demand to
renegotiate their deals.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Gov. Gray Davis is pulling the same scam with power contracts
and proving he is not a man of his word. Since we cannot trade our
"holdout" governor to another state for draft choices or a legislator
to be named later, we'll have to put Davis on waivers for the purpose
of giving him his unconditional release in the next election.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Davis Seeks Reversal of Power Deals," Feb. 24: It is about
time that Davis sought to trash the long-term energy contracts that
gouge the people of California under the so-called energy
crisis--which is nothing but a conspiracy masterminded by Enron,
acquiesced to by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
encouraged and winked at by Bush-Cheney oil cliques.</TE>

Southern California ("Too Many Surfers and Too Few Waves," Feb. 24)?
One of the greatest appeals of the beach is that everyone from every
walk of life can comingle peacefully. Even in ritzy Malibu the
wealthy residents cannot legally block the public from beach access.</LD>
<LD>   It would be a shame to close off some of the most beautiful bluffs

suggest that the figure is grossly distorted. The people in the
military would still be in the military, still being paid and
compensated. Much of the equipment would be used for training,
consequently maintenance costs would still be incurred. I would guess
that additional personnel for the CIA, etc., are being hired, but $30
billion worth? How can we get anything accurate? Asking hasn't

<HD>Analysts Testify Enron Misled Them</HD>
<DH>Probe: The energy giant influenced Wall Street, analysts
say, but ratings were independent of their firms' investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Analysts who continued to recommend Enron Corp. stock to investors
even as the firm slid toward bankruptcy last year testified Wednesday
that they were swayed by Enron's financial deceptions rather than by
their own greed.</LD>
<LD>   The role that Wall Street analysts played in the massive losses
suffered by employees and shareholders of Enron has been the subject
of an investigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
which held a third hearing on the issue Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   No legislation is pending to regulate analysts, but Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) said taking a hard look at the inherent conflicts
in the brokerage business is important.</LD>
<TE>   A lack of faith in company reports and in analysts'
recommendations is shaking public confidence in markets at a time
when half of Americans own stocks--often through employer-sponsored
retirement plans such as 401(k)s, Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's investor is like a swimmer who sees a shark," he said.
"They don't know how many more sharks there are in the water."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' pay often is linked to investment banking fees paid by
firms on which the analyst is issuing advice. Analysts or their
brokerages also often own stock or have other business relationships
with the companies that they recommend, creating conflicts of
interest, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   But the four Wall Street analysts who testified said their Enron
recommendations were based on public documents and conversations with
company executives who remained upbeat. "The role of the analyst is
to make informed judgments about companies based on publicly
available information. We assume such information is complete and
truthful," said Curt Launer, a utility industry analyst at Credit
Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "Without accurate and complete financial reporting from a company,
I simply do not have the proper tools to do my job."</TE>
<TE>   Launer added that he performed his analysis without pressure from
any investment banker or other employee of his firm. Only
inaccuracies and withheld information affected his Enron ratings, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, other witnesses testified that analysts have for years
accentuated the positive about the companies they follow while
minimizing risks.</TE>
<TE>   "For at least the last several years, roughly one-third of all
analysts' recommendations were 'strong buys,'" said Charles Hill,
research chief at ratings tracker Thomson Financial/First Call. "The
total of both 'sells' and 'strong sells' was always less than 2%."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts remained upbeat even as the market tanked in the last two
years, Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Enron, 11 analysts were still rating the stock a
"buy" or "strong buy" as late as Nov. 8, lawmakers said. By that
point, the stock had sunk to $8.41 from about $80 earlier in the
year.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers recently proposed rules
that would bar analysts from receiving compensation that was directly
related to investment banking transactions, restrict their personal
stock trading and increase disclosures about potential conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   However, a spokesman for the Assn. for Investment Management and
Research, which certifies analysts, said some blame must rest on the
people who allegedly fabricated Enron's financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   "The fallout from the scandalous activities at Enron, which
resulted in severe financial losses by investors and a lack of
confidence in the financial markets, should not and cannot be borne
totally by Wall Street analysts," Thomas A. Bowman, president of
AIMR, testified.</TE>
<TE>   In another Senate hearing Wednesday, the head of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. said that Enron's traditional pension plan is
underfunded by at least $125 million, and that the agency may have to
step in to make payments, as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's traditional pension plan is separate from its 401(k)
retirement savings plan.</TE>

<HD>Citibank Settles Probe of  Marketing</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank, the nation's largest credit card issuer,
has agreed to pay $1.6 million as part of a settlement with 27 states
over the way telemarketing firms sell products and services to the
banking company's customers.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement announced Wednesday settles a two-year investigation
led by attorneys general in California, Illinois, New York and
Vermont. The states were looking into customer complaints about the
marketing practices of telemarketing firms contracted by Citibank.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Citibank admitted no wrongdoing. Under the terms of
the settlement, Citibank said it will pay $1.6 million to the states
for investigative costs or consumer education programs.</LD>
<TE>   Citibank has contracted with telemarketing firms for years that
sell products and services to its customers. The states say Citibank
received a percentage of the telemarketing firms' sales in exchange
for its customer lists.</TE>
<TE>   Citibank customers had complained the telemarketing firms used
deceptive sales pitches, which resulted in charges for products and
services they did not knowingly agree to buy, Wisconsin Atty. Gen.
James Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement agreement requires Citibank to prohibit deceptive
solicitations and to approve all scripts and marketing materials. It
requires telemarketing firms to comply with consumer protection laws
and clearly disclose their identities if scripts refer to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also prohibits customer charges without the
cardholder's express authorization.</TE>
<TE>   Citibank said it already has implemented many of the reforms
included in the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that this collective effort will enhance our
communication with our cardholders to ensure that they have the
necessary information to make informed decisions about their
purchases," Citibank spokesman Mark Rodgers said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose 44 cents to $44.24 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Orders for Durable Goods Jump 2.6% in Jan.</HD>
<DH>Economy: Rebound suggests factories are beginning to emerge
from contraction. New-home sales slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Durable goods posted an unexpectedly large jump in January, but
new-home sales fell last month to the lowest level in 11/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   The 2.6% increase in orders, reflecting more demand for autos,
aircraft and computers, followed a 0.9% rise the previous month, the
Commerce Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of new homes slumped 14.8% last month to 823,000 units at an
annual rate, the slowest since June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   A rebound in demand for durable goods that started a month after
the September terrorist attacks suggests factories are emerging from
a contraction that began in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Durable goods orders, excluding transportation equipment, rose
1.3% in January after increasing a revised 0.4% the previous month.
Durable goods are products such as appliances and cars made to last
more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Non-defense capital goods orders, a gauge of business investment
in new equipment, increased 0.5% in January after decreasing 1.2% a
month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for aircraft and parts surged 21.6% in January after rising
0.1% the previous month. Boeing Co., the world's biggest airplane
maker, said it received 104 aircraft orders, up from 41 bookings the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed inventories of durable goods fell 0.6% in
January, the smallest decrease since April.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for automobiles and parts increased 4.3% in January after a

<HD>Enron Cited in Call for Reform</HD>
<DH>Probe: Judge OKs emergency fund for former employees but
refuses to order payout of legal fees to execs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, WARREN VIETH and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Enron debacle signals that corporate executives are increasingly
estranged from the interests of their employees and shareholders and
points to the need for reform, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The current system creates incentives for executives "to game the
accounting system" in order to boost their pay, Greenspan said in
congressional testimony that represented the toughest assessment yet
by a senior government official on the larger framework of the Enron
Corp. meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been a severance, in my judgment, of the interests of
the chief executive officer in many corporations from those of the
shareholders, and that should be pulled together," Greenspan said.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan,
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez took two steps that could be seen as
shifting the balance, in a small way, toward those closer to street
level.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez approved emergency relief for Enron's most destitute
former employees. And he refused to direct an insurance company to
pay out $30 million in legal fees to former and present Enron
officers and directors to defend against allegations that they helped
destroy the company.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez endorsed Enron's request to create a $5-million emergency
fund for 4,500 fired employees and left the door open for a much
larger payout sought by a group of workers and supported by union and
civil rights advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell Peterson, a lawyer for 20 former employees, noted that the
size of the emergency fund exactly matches that of a retention bonus
recently paid to a single Enron executive, John Lavorato, chief
executive of Enron Americas, to encourage him to stay on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's clients asked the court to approve severance packages
of up to $30,000 apiece for all 4,500 workers, plus other salary and
vacation pay he contends they are owed, for a total of about
$73million.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez deferred a decision until at least next week.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the court has approved $4,500 in severance for the fired
employees, but even that hasn't been paid to all of them, Peterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are some of the fired workers unable to pay for medicine
and in danger of losing their homes, but they also have become
pariahs in their hometown of Houston, Peterson told the court.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the financial-printing firm Bowne &amp; Co. ran a
help-wanted ad in the Houston Chronicle this week that said: "No
current or former employees of Enron, Arthur Andersen or the U.S.
government will be considered."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, is under investigation for its
role in approving questionable transactions that led to the collapse
of the energy-trading giant.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of insurance fees to cover executive legal bills, the
judge left it up to the insurer, Aegis, to decide whether to advance
money to the executives, most of whom have been named as defendants
in lawsuits arising from the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew J. Entwistle, lawyer for the Florida State Board of
Administration, whose state-employee retirement funds lost $334
million on Enron stock and bonds, said he was "delighted" with
Gonzalez's ruling, which he said puts the burden on Aegis to screen
carefully any requests for advance legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle said he hopes the insurer will reject requests by such
Enron higher-ups as former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, former CEO
Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow, forcing them to pay initial legal expenses out of their own
pockets.</TE>
<TE>   All three men have been accused of profiteering by cashing in
millions of dollars in stock options and, in Fastow's case, reaping
$30million in fees and profit from Enron's controversial limited
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Wednesday before the House Financial Services
Committee, Greenspan said the Enron debacle had exposed new risks and
vulnerabilities in an increasingly idea-driven economy.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's financial markets appear to be correcting some of the
systemic flaws revealed by Enron, by discounting the value of
companies that appear to rely on accounting tricks to boost
short-term profitability, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Greenspan said more lasting reforms are needed. "I would start
off with the way we account for stock options," he said. He cited
accounting standards that create incentives for corporate executives
to hype reported earnings so they can reap big gains from exercising
options.</TE>
<TE>   David Teece, director of the Institute for Management, Innovation
and Organization at UC Berkeley, said Greenspan's comments clearly
represented a harsh new assessment of the factors present in the
Enron collapse. But he cautioned that the analysis may be premature.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a strong statement. You would expect pundits to say some
thing like this, but Greenspan has a higher burden," Teece said. "He
should be more cautious. Everyone has a sense of distress about
Enron, but all the facts aren't out yet."</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Wednesday, former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker named two men to join him on the Independent Oversight
Board examining Andersen's role in Enron's demise. And at a hearing
in U.S. District Court in New York, lawyers squared off in what could
be a dramatic legal battle over Wall Street's role in the Enron saga.</TE>
<TE>   New York investment bank J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. is trying to
force 11 insurance companies to pay $965 million in Enron-related
claims.</TE>
<TE>   The clash involves surety bonds issued by the insurers to
guarantee energy contracts between Enron and a J.P. Morgan-affiliated
entity known as Mahonia Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   The insurers promised to make payments to J.P. Morgan if Enron
ever reneged on its Mahonia obligations, which occurred when the
energy company slid into bankruptcy in December.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan has portrayed the transactions as legitimate
commodities trades.</TE>
<TE>   But the insurers say they were actually loans disguised as trades
to make Enron's financial position appear stronger.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance company allegations are central to the federal
government's own probe of Enron. Investigators believe that Enron's
ability to shield its debts through murky financial transactions
contributed significantly to the company's demise.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the case also is critical for J.P. Morgan, whose
Enron losses could total as much as $2.6 billion. The hearing
Wednesday was in response to J.P. Morgan's request that the case be
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan attorney John Callagy contended that the language of the
surety bonds was ironclad and did not allow the insurers to deny
payment for any reason.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from Judge Jed Rakoff, Callagy also said that
the insurers were "sophisticated" businesses that willingly agreed to
sell the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff pressed: "So are you saying that if a party is
sophisticated it is fair game for fraud?"</TE>
<TE>   Replied Callagy: "There is no evidence that this transaction has
any fraud, let alone is riddled with fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff also sharply questioned Celia Barenholtz, the attorney for
the insurance companies, on a central question: Did Enron and J.P.
Morgan actually exchange oil and gas, or did they simply engage in
paper transactions designed to mask loans?</TE>
<TE>   Barenholtz contended that even if oil and gas were swapped between
the two firms, the transactions were circular, meaning nothing really
changed hands at the end of the deals.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff said he probably would rule by next week on J.P. Morgan's
request to have the case thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   On the Andersen review board, Volcker named Charles A. Bowsher and
P. Roy Vagelos to join him.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher is a former U.S. comptroller general and chairman of the
Public Oversight Board, an accounting-profession oversight body that
is disbanding at the end of March. Vagelos is the retired chairman
pharmaceutical firm Merck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has ceded Volcker's Independent Oversight Board the
authority to make changes in its policies and take other measures,
such as assigning and firing key personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The panel was established after the accounting firm was widely
criticized for contributing to the downfall of Enron, its former
client.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Board Sees New Rule Proposal by May 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting rules makers made more progress Wednesday on new
guidelines for the financing vehicles used by Enron Corp. to hide
debts, a change that would force thousands of firms to add
liabilities to their books by next year.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board's proposed rules on
"special-purpose entities" would cover the partnerships that Enron
created, but their greatest effect would be on "synthetic leases"
used by many companies to finance property, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   FASB said Wednesday that it hopes to publish a draft of the rules
changes by May 1, then ask for public comment for up to 90 days.</LD>
<TE>   The board is calling for special-purpose entities to be included
on a company's balance sheet if less than 10% of the equity in an
entity is from outside investors. Under existing rules, Enron was
able to keep its partnerships off its books even though outsiders'
capital was less than 3% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   But FASB officials say that, apart from a specific percentage of
outside interest, special-purpose entities should have to be
consolidated on companies' books if it's evident that the entities
aren't truly independent.</TE>
<TE>   Special-purpose entities have long been used by many U.S.
companies to finance projects in a way that allows tax benefits
without visibly impairing balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said that the practice allows companies to appear not
to be responsible for financial obligations that may come back to
haunt them.</TE>
<TE>   In a synthetic lease arrangement, a financial institution sets up
a special-purpose entity that borrows money to finance new
construction or to purchase an existing building for a company. AOL
Time Warner, for example, is financing construction of its new
Manhattan headquarters with a synthetic lease arrangement set up by
Bank of America Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The entity holds the title and leases the facility to the company
for the term of the lease, typically three to seven years, with the
possibility for renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Under FASB's proposals, "The large majority of all synthetic
lease" arrangements would have to be reflected on balance sheets,
FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the company could eventually be on the hook, then the
liability should be fully disclosed on the balance sheet," said
Victor Cunningham, research chief for the Olstein Financial Alert
stock mutual fund. "If we learn anything from Enron, it should be
that this is not the kind of surprise that investors should have."</TE>
<TE>   Previous proposals to change the rules have been opposed by
accounting firms, companies and even members of Congress, on the
grounds that they would be difficult to implement. This time, FASB
has broader support, particularly from lawmakers, Jenkins said.
Twelve congressional committees are holding hearings on Enron's
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have full, open due process and adequate opportunity for
all of our constituents to comment," Jenkins said.</TE>

<HD>Fed: Signs of a Slow, Sure Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Prognosis by Chairman Greenspan adds to consensus
that recession of 2001 will be unusually shallow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday
that he sees increasing signs the U.S. economy will soon emerge from
recession, but warned that the recovery is likely to proceed at a
sluggish pace.</LD>
<LD>   Presenting the central bank's semiannual assessment of the
nation's economic health, Greenspan said the economy appears "close
to a turning point" that will signal the end of the nearly year-old
recession.</LD>
<LD>   The nation has largely recuperated from the financial shock of
Sept. 11, Greenspan said, and there is little evidence that the
collapse of Enron Corp. and other recent economic setbacks will cause
the recovery to stall.</LD>
<TE>   "Even a subdued recovery beginning soon would constitute a truly
remarkable performance for the American economy," Greenspan said in
testimony before the House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's prognosis, though characteristically cautious, added
the Fed's authoritative voice to a growing consensus of economists
who say the recession of 2001 will turn out to be unusually shallow
and short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   If the tentative indications of a turnaround are confirmed,
Greenspan said, "we will have experienced a significantly milder
downturn than the long history of business cycles would have led us
to expect."</TE>
<TE>   But the recovery may prove equally feeble, Greenspan suggested.
The unemployment rate, currently 5.6%, probably will rise above 6%
and stay there "for some time" before the job market begins to firm,
he said. Economic growth will accelerate slowly, reaching an annual
rate of 2.5% to 3% by the end of this year. The gradual expansion is
unlikely to rekindle inflation, which the Fed expects to remain below
1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   His carefully parsed predictions signaled that the Fed feels
little pressure to begin raising interest rates to keep the economy
from overheating. The central bank chopped short-term rates 11 times
last year to combat a deepening business sector downturn and the
shock of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "There were absolutely no hints or signs in the commentary or the
forecasts of the Federal Reserve that there would be any reason to
raise interest rates this year," said Allen Sinai, president of New
York-based Decision Economics.</TE>
<TE>   That message heartened bond traders, who had begun to worry that
interest rate hikes were imminent. But its effect on the stock market
was mixed, as initial relief gave way to anxiety about the
implications of a long, drawn-out recovery. The Dow Jones industrial
average ended the day at 10,127.58, up 12.32, and the S&amp;P 500 eked
out a 0.51 gain to close at 1,109.89. But the Nasdaq composite index
fell 14.98, finishing at 1,751.88.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an expectation out there that Greenspan would have a
more optimistic tone about the recovery," said James W. Paulsen,
chief investment officer with Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "he came out with a report that said, yes, we're out of
recession, but it remains a little tenuous, and it might take a
while."</TE>
<TE>   Newly released economic statistics added to the ambivalence. Only
two days after sales of existing homes set a new record by soaring
16.2% in January, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes
simultaneously plunged 14.8% to an annual rate of 823,000 units, the
lowest level in 1 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, orders for big-ticket durable goods, from
airplanes to appliances, jumped 2.6% last month. The increase was
larger than expected, and suggested that the nation's battered
manufacturing sector was beginning to revive.</TE>
<TE>   More evidence of a turnaround could come today, when the Commerce
Department issues a revised estimate of the economy's performance
during the fourth quarter of 2000. The consensus view of economists
is that last month's initial estimate of a 0.2% annual growth rate
will be bumped up to 1% or more.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the recession will have caused only one contraction in
gross domestic product: the 1.3% decline registered in the third
quarter. The rule of thumb is that it takes two consecutive quarters
of GDP shrinkage to constitute a recession.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said it appears that Enron's collapse will not slow the
economic recovery, and could produce long-term benefits if it leads
to reforms in corporate finances and regulatory oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after the fact, we will look back on this Enron episode
as a period when we put our corporate governance back on track, which
would not have happened without it, in my judgment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Greenspan's relatively upbeat characterization of the
economy seemed to reassure some members of the congressional panel, a
few quarreled with his conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very difficult time recognizing the kind of rosy economy
that you are portraying," said Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), citing
the gradual disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs, the
declining rate of health insurance coverage and the increasing cost
of housing.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not the economy that I see in Vermont, and not the
economy, I think, that exists in many areas of this country."</TE>
<TE>   But Paulsen, the Wells Capital economist, gave Greenspan high
marks for striking a careful balance between optimism and caution.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives just enough critical commentary and scary thoughts to
keep you sufficiently spooked, but at the same time just enough
optimistic rhetoric to keep you believing in the future," Paulsen
said.</TE>

<HD>State Lawmakers Seek to Bar Gene-Altered Fish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California lawmakers, environmentalists and fishermen are joining
together to stop the spread of genetically engineered fish into the
state.</LD>
<LD>   Two bills and a joint resolution recently introduced in the
Legislature would bar live gene-altered fish from entering the state
or require special labeling when sold in California stores.</LD>
<LD>   California would be the second U.S. state to take action. A less
stringent Maryland law adopted last year bans the fish from state's
network of waterways but allows them in separated ponds and lakes.</LD>
<TE>   Federal action in Maine also has declared these new types of fish
off-limits to protect the endangered Atlantic salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call this [legislation] a preemptive strike," said Karen
Reyna of the Ocean Conservancy, which is concerned that transgenic
salmon and other fish could escape from ocean pens and breed with
unaltered salmon, shortening their life spans and reducing their
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Several East Coast firms are trying to develop stocks of
transgenic salmon and catfish to be sold to fish farmers. These fish,
spliced with genes from faster-growing species, would let farmers get
bigger fish to market for less money.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the aquaculture business in California said
his members are still studying the technology and haven't taken a
position on the measures.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be many social benefits in having some form of
genetic engineering," said Justin Malan, executive director of the
California Aquaculture Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Malan noted that some interspecies hybridization already has
occurred naturally.</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at the hybrid striped bass," Malan said. "Sharing genes
between species can occur in the wild."</TE>
<TE>   The concern of scientists is that these large fish, which have a
mating advantage in the wild, would produce offspring ill-equipped to
survive. Some research has shown that genetically altered fish die
earlier than those unaltered.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists said there are inadequate state and federal
regulations to protect native fish populations and the heath of
humans.</TE>
<TE>   Under SB 1525, sponsored by state Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford),
genetically engineered salmon and other fish would be classified as
an aquatic nuisance species. People convicted of possessing live
transgenic fish or planting them into state waters could be subject
to a fine of up to $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   A bill in the Assembly, AB 2962, would require labeling of all
transgenic fish in supermarkets.</TE>

<HD>Investors Pump Big Cash Into Stock Funds</HD>
<DH>Securities: Net $19.6-billion inflow in January surprises
some analysts, but data show avoidance of aggressive 'growth' and
tech sectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite getting smacked by two straight down years for stocks,
investors plowed a net $19.6 billion of new money into equity mutual
funds in January.</LD>
<LD>   The cash inflow, reported Wednesday by the Investment Company
Institute, was the highest monthly total in a year and the
fifth-highest January inflow ever.</LD>
<LD>   The tally surprised some analysts who expected investors to be
less willing to buy stock funds after suffering heavy losses in 2001
and as the market weakened again in January.</LD>
<TE>   The month's total, which measures gross fund purchases minus
redemptions, suggests many investors continue to have faith in stocks
as a way to meet long-term goals such as retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, other data for January show fund investors in general are
playing it safer, diversifying their portfolios and avoiding the most
aggressive "growth" and technology sector funds.</TE>
<TE>   Bond mutual funds took in a net $10.6 billion in new cash in
January, continuing what has been a major shift of investors' capital
into lower-risk funds over the last year, according to data from the
Investment Company Institute, the funds' chief trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Also, real estate-related stock funds have seen steady inflows
this year as investors seek the cushioning effect of high dividend
yields, said Bob Adler, head of AMG Data Services Inc., an Arcata,
Calif., firm that tracks industry trends.</TE>
<TE>   But volatile tech-stock funds have suffered net outflows every
week this year, Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are going about this with a hint of caution," said Lars
Schuster, analyst at Boston-based Financial Research Corp., which
tracks investment trends. "It's a balanced attack with an emphasis on
diversification."</TE>
<TE>   Although the stock market overall has been weak again this month,
some major fund companies say investors still have been net buyers of
equity funds. Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and Strong
Investments say their stock funds have seen positive cash flows this
month, though not necessarily on January's pace.</TE>
<TE>   Bond fund cash flows also have stayed positive this month at
Fidelity and Vanguard, the two biggest mutual fund firms, the
companies said. Though diversification may be one reason for the
interest in bond funds, analysts say "performance-chasing" could be
another: Many small investors favor fund categories that have the
best recent performance records, and most major types of bond funds
made money last year, while the average stock fund lost 11%.</TE>
<TE>   More investors also may be less inclined to keep cash in
ultra-safe money market funds as yields fall to record lows. Data
from the Investment Company Institute show that money funds used
primarily by small investors had a net cash outflow of $6.9 billion
in January.</TE>
<TE>   The average seven-day money fund yield eased this week to a record
low 1.39%, according to IMoneyNet.com.</TE>
<TE>   The official stock fund cash flow data for February, to be issued
in late March by the institute, will give a stronger clue about
investor trends this year, Schuster said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see if the solid optimism is still
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   January tends to be a big month for fund inflows because many
investors wait until the December ritual of fund capital gains
distributions has passed before buying new shares, Schuster said.
Investors also may focus more on financial planning at the start of a
year.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Investment Company Institute said this
week that stock funds distributed an estimated $72 billion in capital
gains to shareholders in 2001, the lowest total since 1995, as the
bear market resulted in fewer realized capital gains for funds.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Expects Wider Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gateway Inc., the second-biggest direct seller of personal computers,
said it will have a much wider loss in the first quarter as it cuts
prices to gain market share.</LD>
<LD>   The company expects to report a loss of $100 million to $120
million, or 18 cents a share to 24 cents a share, Chief Financial
Officer Joe Burke told analysts at a meeting in San Diego. Analysts
were expecting a loss of 7 cents, on average, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue should come in at about $1 billion, the Poway,
Calif.-based company said, missing analysts' expectations of $1.06
billion.</LD>
<TE>   Gateway has said it expects pretax losses for several quarters as
it tries to reclaim market share with reduced prices and to increase
the more profitable sales of services. The company said it now
expects to return to profitability in fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, Gateway said it expects a loss of 39 cents to
49 cents a share, compared with the 16-cent loss analysts forecast,
with revenue within earlier expectations at $4.5 billion to $5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gateway fell 33 cents, or 6%, to $5.10 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before the forecast was announced.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Exec Files Suit Against Global Crossing Chiefs</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Former employee says he was fired in retaliation
after he questioned firm's accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS  and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Global Crossing Ltd. employee who questioned the propriety
of the company's accounting methods sued company founder Gary Winnick
and three other executives Wednesday, accusing them of firing him in
retaliation for his allegations and then impugning his reputation.</LD>
<LD>   The former employee, Roy L. Olofson, was vice president of finance
at the troubled telecommunications company until late last year. He
was catapulted into the national spotlight a month ago when his
accounting allegations were reported in  the Los Angeles Times.</LD>
<LD>   The Global Crossing executives "apparently believed they could
discredit Mr. Olofson to such an extent that no one would believe
him," said Paul Murphy, one of the attorneys representing Olofson.
"They were wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Winnick, through a spokesman, said the lawsuit "is baseless, has
no merit, and we are confident that it will ultimately be shown as
such."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Winnick, the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court
in Los Angeles names Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs, Executive
Vice President of Finance Joseph Perrone, and Thomas Casey, one of
the company's four former chief  executives. They could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives repeatedly have denied any wrongdoing and have
portrayed Olofson as a disgruntled ex-employee bent on pocketing
settlement money.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson has been threatening legal action against the company for
several months, but his strategy was derailed by the company's filing
for bankruptcy  protection last month, the fourth-largest in U.S.
history. While operating under Chapter 11 protection, Global Crossing
is shielded from new lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   That made it impossible for Olofson to sue the company directly
for a traditional claim of wrongful termination in state court, legal
experts said. Instead, his suit names the four executives and raises
claims of defamation, interference with his employment contract and
"interference with prospective economic advantage" by failing to
protect the value of his 401(k) retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   But by filing his case in federal court, Olofson also faces an
uphill battle, according to employment law experts. Federal judges
generally are more likely than state judges to dismiss claims such as
Olofson's, attorneys said. If the case isn't dismissed, Olofson will
have to get a unanimous jury verdict to prevail. In state court,
plaintiffs need the votes of only nine out of 12 jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really, really hard to bring these types of claims unless
you find a smoking gun," said Jamie Johnson, a partner in Brobeck,
Phleger &amp; Harrison's labor and employment group in Los Angeles, which
is not involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although it would have been easier for Olofson to win a wrongful
termination claim against the company, he may be able to convince a
jury that individual executives were trying to punish him for being
critical  of Global Crossing's accounting practices, said David
Kadue, a partner who specializes in employment law at Seyfarth Shaw
in Century City, which also has no involvement in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson claims to be the only employee who was laid off without
receiving severance or other termination benefits, and if that proves
to be true, then "it certainly sounds suspicious," Kadue said.</TE>
<TE>   In his lawsuit, Olofson provides further details of his accounting
concerns and the efforts by Bermuda-based Global Crossing executives
to keep those allegations secret. The alleged accounting tactics
helped the company mask its deteriorating financial health, which
culminated in its Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson also accused Winnick of defaming him during a recent "town
hall" meeting attended by as many as 70 Global Crossing employees. At
the meeting, "Winnick stated in sum or substance that 'The definition
of an extortionist is Roy Olofson,''' according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Olofson's suit are claims that the company
improperly used long-term contracts for network capacity to boost
revenue, even though many of the deals did not bring in cash.
Olofson's claims are under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson said he first raised his concerns about Global Crossing's
accounting in meetings last May 31 and June 1 with finance executive
Perrone, who was Olofson's boss.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 6, he wrote a five-page letter to the company's top lawyer
and ethics officer providing a detailed analysis of what he called
deceptive accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Since his allegations first came to light, a number of current and
former Global Crossing employees have echoed Olofson's concerns.
Former employees say Global Crossing engaged in many "sham" deals
that merely shifted money between telecommunications companies,
without bringing in new cash or yielding useful network capacity.</TE>

<HD>HP Chief Pushes Merger on Wall St.</HD>
<DH>Computers: Carly Fiorina meets with analysts and explains
why she thinks buying Compaq would be beneficial. She also chides two
sons of co-founders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a crucial, direct appeal to Wall Street, Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina told analysts Wednesday that the proposed
$21.7-billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp. is vital for the
company and asked them to ignore the daily attacks from dissident
director Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   With several major investors on record as being against the deal,
and with the March 19 shareholder vote looming, Fiorina kicked off a
daylong meeting with analysts in New York by sticking to the themes
she has sounded since the deal was announced Sept. 3.</LD>
<LD>   Fiorina explained why she thinks Compaq would let HP offer more
end-to-end packages to corporate customers, and she detailed the
projected financial merits of the deal. In particular, she said,
Compaq strengthens HP's hand in personal computers, Microsoft Corp.
Windows-based servers, data storage and high-tech services.</LD>
<TE>   "Should we confine ourselves to growth in existing categories
where we already are the market leader?" Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   Before running a video with pro-merger testimonials from
customers, Fiorina slammed Hewlett and the other co-founder's son,
David W. Packard, who sponsored independent polls that revealed
widespread employee opposition to the merger at two HP sites.</TE>
<TE>   She said both heirs are trying to mislead investors "because they
cannot win this campaign on the substance."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be distracted by the so-called focus-and-execute plan,"
Fiorina said, referring to the alternate strategy Hewlett proposes.
"It is not a plan--it is a press release."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, which was broadcast over the Internet, also featured
presentations from Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman and other top
executives. Wayman said HP's pro forma earnings per share in 2003
could be $1.51 with Compaq or $1.35 without it.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett made a big pitch of his own Wednesday, filing a 48-page
report with the Securities and Exchange Commission reiterating his
position that HP is overpaying for Compaq and that integrating the
companies is too risky.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares Wednesday rose 2 cents to $20.03, while Compaq fell 20
cents to $10.20, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq shares are trading 19% below the value of Hewlett-Packard's
offer, compared with 37% in November. The smaller gap indicates that
some investors believe the purchase is likely to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina also responded to criticism that her company won't
disclose what it plans to pay top officials if the deal goes through.
Hewlett has pressed executives for weeks to release the details, and
Tuesday he said Fiorina and Compaq CEO Michael Capellas together may
be paid more than $115 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina called his statement "one of the most egregious" claims he
has made. She said the packages haven't been decided and that the
combined company's compensation committee should set the new
salaries.</TE>

<HD>Japan Unveils Plan to Fight Deflation, Reduce Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>In a bid to deliver on pledges made during President Bush's trip to
Japan last week, the Japanese government Wednesday released an
economic package designed to ease deflationary pressure and reduce
bad bank debt.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts predict it won't do much of either. "I'd score this
package a 40 out of 100," said Morio Imai, an independent economist.
"I see little impact coming out of it. They're just recycling the
same old ideas again."</LD>
<LD>   The plan includes measures to beef up bank inspections and
disclose the findings; buy bad loans from banks at market value;
increase liquidity in the monetary system; and buy bank shares.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say despite its stated goal of fighting deflation, the
plan includes no significant measures to reinflate the economy. Nor
does it do more than tinker with Japan's enormous bad-debt problem,
estimated at more than $600 billion by some private economists.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's primary objective is to prop up the stock market over
the short term and allow Japan's battered companies and banks to
squeak through the end of the fiscal year less than five weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan can get through March 31," predicted Susumu Okano, head of
economic research at Daiwa Research Institute, an affiliate of Daiwa
Bank. "I think they'll avoid any sort of financial meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   In the land of incremental decision-making, Japan's policymakers
recently have signaled a greater willingness to inject public funds
into the banking system if there's a crisis--a break with earlier
suggestions that such use of taxpayer money is political dynamite.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there still are big obstacles preventing Japan from
grappling seriously with its problems. Before Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi can allocate the funds, he must make a formal
declaration that Japan has a financial crisis. However, many
politicians and bureaucrats, who have spent the last decade
reassuring all that the situation is under control, will strongly
resist such a move.</TE>
<TE>   Any stated crisis also threatens to further weaken Koizumi's
political position at a time when he's seen his popularity sharply
decline. It also could saddle him with the legacy of having a crisis
declared on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Even assuming all those hurdles can be circumvented and a crisis
is declared, banks are required to formally request the money--a step
they may balk at until they're absolutely desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians don't want to declare a financial crisis, and bankers
don't want to ask for the money because they'll lose their jobs,"
said Ron Bevacqua, economist with Commerz Securities Japan. "The
problem won't be fixed until there is a real crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Japan continues to spend money on troubled companies, despite
prospects that the funds will never be recovered. On Wednesday, Daiei
Inc.'s main banks announced a $4-billion bailout for the supermarket
chain. Japan's economic landscape is littered with other companies in
equally bad shape.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble is, there's not just one Daiei but thousands of
companies like that out there," Bevacqua said. "No politician in any
country is willing to close 20% of the nation's companies and weather
10% unemployment."</TE>
<TE>   As the bad news pours in, Japanese are increasingly adopting a
defensive outlook and realizing they'll have to fend for themselves,
in a nation that once looked to the government for protection and
near-absolute security.</TE>
<TE>   Kazumi Ono, a 27-year-old secretary at a Tokyo law firm, said she
worries about job security, the rising cost of medical care and the
nation's pension system.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt Koizumi will be able to reform Japan," she said. "I'm
really quite worried about the future."</TE>

<HD>Longs CEO Resigns; Retailer Expects Drop in Quarter Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longs Drug Stores Corp., which operates a chain of drugstores in the
western U.S., said President and Chief Executive Steve Roath resigned
and that first-quarter profit will unexpectedly decline.</LD>
<LD>   Roath said in a statement that he is leaving to let his successor
carry out the retailer's long-term plans from start to finish as
Roath had planned to retire. Board member Harold Somerset was named
president and chief executive while Longs looks for a replacement.</LD>
<LD>   Fiscal first-quarter per-share profit will fall to 26 cents to 30
cents from 31 cents a year earlier, Longs said in a separate
statement. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail
measure, will rise as much as 2%, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Longs was forecast to earn 33 cents a share, the average estimate
of three analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, net income almost tripled to $21.8 million,
or 58 cents a share, from $8 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier.
Sales in the quarter ended Jan. 31 climbed 9.7% to $1.21 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding costs for closing stores, year-ago profit would have
been $23.4 million, or 63 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Longs also said it will realign its board so that it will be
mostly made up of outside directors.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Longs, based in Walnut Creek, Calif., fell 28 cents to
$24.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. The news was released after
the close of regular trading.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Nancy Cockerham didn't immediately return a phone call
for further comment.</TE>

<HD>Early Stock Rally Withers Amid Conflicting Signals</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Lowered profit estimate for Cisco Systems
damps optimism fueled by Fed chief's testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reassuring words from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave
the stock market a lift Wednesday, but the rally fizzled after an
analyst lowered earnings estimates for Cisco Systems, prompting a
sharp sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   The volatility, which left prices mixed for the day, fit the
pattern of recent weeks--stocks advance and then fall back amid
conflicting signs of economic recovery and corporate profitability.
The market rose strongly Friday and Monday, with the Dow chalking up
an aggregate gain of 300 points. Then it dropped Tuesday and couldn't
sustain a rise on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "In a correctional market, there's a very thin amount of
confidence, and that's why you get these gyrations," said Alfred E.
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "Today, it
sat at its highs for three hours, then gravity took over."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average was up nearly 140 points after
Greenspan spoke to Congress, then fell into negative territory before
recovering to register a gain of 12.32 points, or 0.1%, to 10,127.58.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index eked out a 0.5-point gain, or 0.1%, to 1,109.89, while the
Nasdaq composite index--which includes Cisco--was off 14.98 points,
or 0.9%, at 1,751.88.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, and were
about even on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan told Congress he sees increasing signs that the
recession is coming to an end, although he cautioned that the
recovery would not be robust.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that factory
orders for durable goods rose more than expected in January, the
latest sign that manufacturing might be pulling out of its slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Investors reacted to the news positively, then began selling after
Wachovia Securities lowered its estimate for Cisco's fiscal
third-quarter results to reflect continued cuts in capital spending
by telecommunications service providers.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco fell $1.26, or more than 8%, to $14.24.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-tech companies also fell. Emulex dropped $3.48 to
$33.52. Sun Microsystems was off 35 cents at $8.66, while Intel fell
13 cents to $29.89. Microsoft fell 16 cents to $58.39 despite being
up $1.60 in early trading.</TE>
<TE>   However, the bond market enjoyed its best day in a month as
Greenspan's cautious testimony eased concern that the Fed will raise
interest rates anytime soon. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note tumbled to 4.83% from 4.92% Tuesday, while the two-year
T-note yield slid to 2.92% from 3.02%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks rose on the positive economic news. Citigroup
was up 44 cents at $44.24, while American Express rose 53 cents to
$35.77. Mortgage lender Fannie Mae gained $1.14 to $77.91. The
Bloomberg News index of financial services stocks rose almost 1%.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotech company ImClone surged $5.01 to $20.53--a 32% gain--on
reports that the Food and Drug Administration might not require the
company to make a new clinical trial for its cancer drug Erbitux. The
stock had been badly beaten after the FDA declined to even review
ImClone's application for Erbitux in December, saying crucial data
were missing.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has a deal with ImClone to market
Erbitux, also rose, gaining $1.98 to $47.49.</TE>
<TE>   * Clear Channel Communications fell $2.09 to $47 after the major
radio broadcaster reported a sharply wider net loss for its fourth
quarter due to acquisition related expenses.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Seeks Dismissal of Stiffer Sanctions</HD>
<DH>Courts: The software giant says holdouts cannot seek
changes to its business practices. States call settlement deal
inadequate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KRIM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. asked a federal judge Wednesday to throw out efforts
by state antitrust enforcers to obtain stiffer sanctions against the
company than it agreed to in a settlement deal with the Department of
Justice.</LD>
<LD>   In a detailed filing in federal district court, company attorneys
argued that only the U.S. government can legally seek changes to
Microsoft's business practices that are national in scope.</LD>
<LD>   Nine states and the District of Columbia, which did not sign onto
the settlement, "seek to establish themselves as national antitrust
policymakers, displacing the executive branch of the federal
government," Microsoft's attorneys said. "This they cannot do."</LD>
<TE>   The states pursuing the case have labeled the settlement deal
inadequate and riddled with loopholes. They have proposed alternate
language for some provisions and new sanctions against the company,
changes that Microsoft has said would cripple its business.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa Atty. Gen. Tom Miller, who leads the state coalition of
prosecutors in the case, vowed to fight the company's latest move.</TE>
<TE>   "The Microsoft position would undermine lawful, proper and
practical enforcement of our country's antitrust laws by the states
and perhaps by private parties," he said. "Our system depends on the
strength of shared jurisdiction, and it is firmly based on a century
of case law."</TE>
<TE>   But the Microsoft case has strayed into murky legal territory.
"States have a right to ask a judge to change Microsoft's business
practices," said Hillard Sterling, a Chicago antitrust attorney.
"Microsoft's argument is based on a strained and narrow
interpretation of the federal antitrust statutes."</TE>
<TE>   What is less clear, other antitrust experts said, is whether
sanctions proposed by states can supplant those put forth by the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Never before have some states in an antitrust case supported a
federal deal while others decided to seek stricter restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   But the case also is unprecedented because the settlement was
reached after a federal appeals court upheld many counts of
anti-competitive conduct by Microsoft, and ordered new hearings on
what penalties should be imposed. Federal District Court Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has scheduled hearings to begin March 11.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and the government said Wednesday that they will make
changes to their proposed antitrust settlement.</TE>

<HD>Tarnished Penney Regaining Its Shine</HD>
<DH>Retail: One year into a five-year turnaround plan, CEO
Allen Questrom is earning cautious praise from investors, customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the summer of 2000, J.C. Penney Co. was held out as a dinosaur, an
aging chain of dowdy department stores squeezed between smarter
discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and higher-priced specialty
clothing retailers such as Gap Inc. Shares in Penney's stock
plummeted to less than $10 from a 1998 high of more than $77.</LD>
<LD>   What a difference Allen Questrom makes.</LD>
<LD>   Since taking over the helm at the Plano, Texas-based company in
September 2000, the 61-year-old turnaround whiz--credited previously
with reviving Neiman Marcus Group Inc., the giant Federated
Department Stores Inc. and, more recently, Barneys New York Inc.--has
brought Penney back to the ranks of the viable despite last year's
tough retail climate.</LD>
<TE>   Although no one is yet declaring victory for the old-line
retailer, which also owns the Eckerd drugstore chain, Penney
investors and customers have become more bullish about the company.
Penney last week reported a $95-million profit for its fiscal fourth
quarter, a sharp reversal from a loss of $580 million a year ago and
leading to the company's first annual profit since 1998. Sales at
Penney's stores open at least a year rose almost 4%, its fourth
straight quarter of same-store gains.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back in the game," said Vanessa Castagna, Penney's chief
operating officer for stores, merchandising and catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Questrom has moved swiftly in the first year of his five-year
restructuring plan for Penney. He closed laggard stores, cut
thousands of jobs, overhauled the retailer's out-of-date buying
system and moved out career Penney administrators in favor of
top-flight merchants, many of whom cut their teeth at Federated and
other higher-end department stores.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a herculean task in front of him, but I think he's up it,"
said Bob Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, who rates the stock
a "strong buy." "He's done a great job in the first year."</TE>
<TE>   With its century-old roots, Penney was once the dependable choice
of millions of middle-income Americans looking for good value. But
for years, the retailer, like Kmart Corp., had lost market share to
discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target, which lured customers with
newer formats, lower prices and more fashionable merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   While Penney was bound to the shopping malls, those discount
stores and other lower-priced alternatives offered customers more
convenient parking and the ability to get in and out faster.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse for Penney, Kohl's Corp., a Wall Street darling and
suburban haven of brand names and value prices, posted quarter after
quarter of winning sales and profit serving onetime Penney customers
who wanted better than Wal-Mart for less money than Macy's.</TE>
<TE>   Questrom's first moves were aimed at making structural changes
that would give Penney's stores the leaner, cleaner look and feel of
some of its upstart competitors. Last year, he closed 44 of the
retailer's 1,100 stores, trimmed the number of Penney's catalogs and
pages and cut 5,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He also brought in top talent from throughout the retail industry,
a dramatic change for a company that had promoted almost entirely
from within. Questrom himself was the first outsider to be chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   "Penney's always focused on being a quality store without focusing
on fashion," Questrom said in an interview. "We think we can add a
lot to our equation by adding fashion and making sure we still have
the quality."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Questrom also directed a change in the company's
corporate structure, a move that many on Wall Street interpreted as a
precursor to spinning off the 2,650-store Eckerd chain, which the
company acquired in 1996 for $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have estimated that Penney could garner as much as
$5billion for Eckerd, but Questrom has his eye on the $8 billion to
$11 billion he thinks the company could be worth in two or three
years. At the moment, Eckerd is contending with a lawsuit and an
investigation by the Florida attorney general stemming from
complaints that the chain overcharged customers for prescriptions.
Eckerd said the allegation is baseless, but the legal challenges have
been costly and are a major factor in the recent decline in the
company's stock price. Shares closed Wednesday at $19.71, down $1.02,
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing worse than selling a dilapidated house or a car
that doesn't work," Questrom said, referring to Eckerd. "It will be
worth more if I can fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Questrom made his name fixing things, most notably at Federated
Department Stores, which he brought out of bankruptcy in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in his career, Questrom ran Nieman Marcus and
reinvigorated the upscale chain. Just before joining Penney, he also
brought Barneys out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   At Penney, which last year reported companywide sales of more than
$38 billion, Questrom is engineering perhaps the biggest change in
the area that he knows best: merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   With help from merchandising stars such as Castagna, a former
Wal-Mart executive, Questrom is sprucing up stores and overhauling
Penney's clumsy buying system, which allowed local managers to choose
the items for their stores.</TE>
<TE>   The change is no easy feat, requiring Penney's first real
merchandise managers, 14 new distribution centers and new technology.</TE>
<TE>   But the change allowed the company to extract better deals with
manufacturers, guarantee high quality and high fashion across all
stores and, for the first time, develop a national marketing
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One year into a five-year turnaround, Questrom is earning cautious
praise on Wall Street and in the malls.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to walk through here, but I wouldn't buy anything," said

Galleria. "Now, we were like, wow, this stuff is cute."</TE>
<TE>   Sales in 2002 will come up against harder comparisons that include
bigger expenses.</TE>
<TE>   That means the stores must continue to increase same-store sales
and generate strong growth in gross margins to meet analyst profit
estimates of 95 cents a share for the current fiscal year, more than
double the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're only one step up the ladder. Now our challenge is to take
the second step up the ladder, and with each step up the ladder it
gets a little harder," Questrom said. "But if you get the merchandise
right and if you get the strategy right, you can get the people into
your stores."</TE>
<TE>   And all of that may well depend on Questrom, which is just fine
for some on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has ever gotten rich betting against him," said Bill
Nygren, a portfolio manager at Chicago-based Oakmark Funds, which
holds more than 3 million Penney shares.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. said U.S. regulators may consider its request to
bring a colon cancer drug to market if the biotech company resubmits
its U.S. clinical data and includes new data from Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means the drug, Erbitux, could be on the market by
the middle of 2003, analysts said. That would be more than a year
later than ImClone had hoped for, but not as late as some had feared
after the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept the
company's first application last year.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based ImClone's shares soared $5.01, or 32.3%, to $20.53
on Nasdaq. Shares of partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose $1.98 to
$47.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Household International Inc. said that it would cut fees and reduce
interest rates for mortgage borrowers, countering charges by consumer
advocates that it engages in unfair lending practices.</LD>
<LD>   Sheila Bair, assistant secretary for financial institutions at the
Treasury Department, praised the decision by Household, a leading
lender to consumers who have patchy or poor credit histories.</LD>
<LD>   But representatives of the Assn. of Community Organizations for
Reform Now downplayed the Prospect Heights, Ill.-based company's
moves.</LD>
<TE>   "It is interesting they keep denying they've ever done anything
wrong with their lending. But their continuing public relations
efforts are an acknowledgment that that is not the case," Lisa Donner
of the community group said.</TE>
<TE>   The group earlier this month filed suit against Household,
accusing it of overcharging borrowers in California. Household denied
the suit's allegations.</TE>

<LD>Sales of variable annuities fell 17.8% to $112.8 billion last year as
a rocky stock market dampened investor enthusiasm for the insurance
products, according to figures released by the National Assn. for
Variable Annuities, a trade group.</LD>
<LD>   The popularity of variable annuities soared during the 1990s bull
market, with sales peaking at $137.2 billion in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Increased sales also drew increased regulatory scrutiny, including
a Securities and Exchange Commission warning that variable annuities
are not appropriate for many investors and that the investment's
costs might outweigh its benefits.</LD>
<TE>   A variable annuity is a combination of an insurance contract and
an investment in which gains can grow tax-deferred.</TE>

<HD>House Passes Broadband Access Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Measure would remove requirements that Baby
Bells open their networks to rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House on Wednesday approved a controversial measure that frees
the regional Bell telephone companies from having to share their
high-speed data wires with rivals--a reform backers say will
encourage the phone giants to more aggressively roll out faster
Internet access.</LD>
<LD>   The 273-157 vote approving the Internet Freedom and Broadband
Deployment Act of 2001 was a victory for the so-called Baby Bells,
which argued that expanding high-speed Internet access, or broadband,
will help boost the recovering U.S. economy and enable consumers and
businesses to watch videos online, download large files or even
undergo data-intensive medical diagnoses.</LD>
<LD>   "With this vote today, House members took a giant step forward
toward economic recovery, increased innovation and expanded consumer
choice," said Walter B. McCormick Jr., president of the U.S. Telecom
Assn., whose members include the four Baby Bells and about 1,400
other local phone carriers.</LD>
<TE>   McCormick added that House passage of the bill moves the
Bells--comprising BellSouth Corp., Qwest Communications International
Inc., SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.--one
step closer to leveling the playing field with cable TV companies,
which serve about 70% of the nation's nearly 10million broadband
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its wide margin of approval in the House, the broadband
bill--which was co-authored by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.)--faces an uphill battle in the Senate,
where Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) has
decried the measure as "blasphemy."</TE>
<TE>   "If Tauzin-Dingell passes, you will have an unregulated monopoly,"
said Hollings during a news conference Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.) and Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) also are siding with upstart phone rivals such as
Allegiance Telecom Inc. and long-distance carriers such as WorldCom
Inc. and AT&amp;T Corp. in opposing the broadband measure. They accuse
the Bells of seeking the legislation in order to dominate broadband
the way they do local phone service.</TE>
<TE>   The broadband bill would remove requirements in the 1996
Telecommunications Act that the Baby Bells first share their networks
on a nondiscriminatory basis with competitors before being allowed to
offer high-speed Internet service nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which passed the House with fewer votes than supporters
had predicted a few weeks ago, also would bar the Federal
Communications Commission and state public utility commissions from
regulating "the rates, terms or conditions" of broadband service.</TE>
<TE>   Although no law bars the regional Bells from offering high-speed
Internet access, the phone giants say they have been reluctant to
invest the estimated $200 billion it would take to bring broadband to
most Americans' doorsteps because current federal rules require them
to offer their facilities to rivals at what they say is an
unprofitable "wholesale" cost.</TE>
<TE>   The House broadband measure has been the subject of intense
lobbying. AT&amp;T, Sprint and WorldCom, which fought to defeat the
legislation, have contributed a total of $12.6 million to federal
candidates and their parties since 1999. The Baby Bells gave $19.4
million in contributions over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   As of June, there were nearly 10million high-speed Internet
subscribers in the U.S., up 36% since the beginning of 2001 and 250%
from the year before.</TE>
<TE>   With the Senate unlikely to embrace the House broadband measure,
opponents say they will turn their attention to the FCC, which
announced this month that it was considering a proposal to deregulate
high-speed Internet in a manner similar to the House bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Our next big battleground is the FCC, where Chairman [Michael K.]
Powell has teed up a lot of the same issues as" the House broadband
bill, said John Windhausen Jr., president of the Assn. for Local
Telecommunications Services, a Washington trade group that represents
about 65 companies competing with the Bells to provide broadband.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Overcharged Latinos, Suit Alleges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of former patients is suing the nation's second-biggest
hospital chain, alleging that Tenet Healthcare Corp. overcharged poor
and uninsured Latinos as part of a scheme to take advantage of a
federally funded charity care program.</LD>
<LD>   Seven lawsuits have been filed in various state courts in Southern
California, each alleging that Tenet ran a two-tier billing scheme
that greatly inflated the costs of medical procedures, most often
involving Latinos. This was done, the lawsuits allege, to reap huge
federal reimbursements through the Medicaid Disproportionate Share
Hospital Payment Program.</LD>
<LD>   "They are making their money on the backs of taxpayers and the
poor," said K.B. Forbes, a spokesman for the patients.</LD>
<TE>   A Tenet spokesman was dismissive of the suits and referred to
Forbes as a political operative with close ties to an Indianapolis
medical insurance firm from which Tenet is trying to collect $2
million in unpaid medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have been slimed by an orchestrated attack from
sharp political operatives posing as activists for the poor and
uninsured," said the spokesman, Harry Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes was a spokesman for conservative presidential hopeful Pat
Buchanan.</TE>
<TE>   The DSH program provides state and federal funds for what is
commonly referred to as uncompensated or charity care, treatment for
a patient who is uninsured and unable to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits accuse Tenet of refusing partial payments so as to
qualify more cases as DSH eligible.</TE>
<TE>   One plaintiff, Pasqual Rivera, said he first heard about his
hospital bill through a Tenet collection agency. Rivera said he
offered partial payments of $5,000 and $10,000 on a $28,604 bill, but
they were turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said it offered Rivera a 30% discount on his bill and
suggested an installment plan.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said that, far from penalizing Latino patients, Tenet was
the one Southern California hospital group expanding services in
middle-to-low-income Latino communities.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Health Services official who oversees
the DSH program said that even if Tenet were greatly exaggerating the
cost of its charity care--and he had no indication that it was--the
effect would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "They would not have been able to inflate their DSH funding in any
significant way, if at all," said Stan Rosenstein, an assistant
deputy director for the agency.</TE>

<HD>Suits Filed in Singer's Crash</HD>
<DH>Courts: Families of two victims who died in the plane
tragedy that killed rising star Aaliyah blame Virgin Records' travel
arrangements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The families of two hairstylists who died last summer with rising R&amp;B
singer and movie actress Aaliyah in a plane crash sued Virgin Records
for wrongful death Wednesday, accusing the label of cutting travel
costs with tragic results.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in front of the civil courthouse, attorney
Brian Panish charged that nine people died needlessly because Virgin
"put profits over people" and hired a "fly-by-night" charter company
to take Aaliyah, 22, and her entourage to Florida after shooting her
"Rock the Boat" video in the Bahamas. The suits are believed to be
the first filed on behalf of family members of the crash victims.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Dodd, 34, and Eric Forman, 29, best friends since boyhood,
died after the overloaded twin-engine Cessna 402-B crashed on takeoff
Aug. 25 in the Bahamas. Forman was killed almost instantly, while
Dodd survived until the next day, Panish said.</LD>
<TE>   He alleged that the label "did not spend the appropriate amount of
money to transport the people working on this video." He added, "Do
you think that type of transportation would have been provided for
Madonna?"</TE>
<TE>   Nearly identical lawsuits filed on behalf of Dodd's and Forman's
families in Los Angeles County Superior Court seek unspecified
damages from Virgin Records America Inc. (owned by the EMI Group),
Blackhawk International Airways Inc., and several video production
companies. All, according to the suit, were involved in making the
travel arrangements or shooting the video. None had any immediate
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits allege negligence in "the inadequate travel planning,
in the limited budget allotted to the travel plans, in the decision
to charter only one plane, in the selection of this particular
charter, [and] in the decision to allow the plane to take off in its
grossly overloaded state."</TE>
<TE>   Posthumously, Aaliyah's star remains bright. Her film "Queen of
the Damned" opened tops at the box office last weekend, grossing
$14.8 million, and the "Rock the Boat" song and video are receiving
heavy play.</TE>
<TE>   "The Virgin recording group is quick to profit from Aaliyah's
record and video, yet won't provide information to the families. We
want to know what they're hiding before any other senseless deaths
occur," said Panish, who represents Dodd's mother, Jacqueline Manuel,
and Forman's mother, sister and father--Mae Lois Williams, Sondra
Williams and Gilbert Forman. Mae Lois Williams is incapacitated by a
stroke and the family relied on Eric Forman to help care for her,
court papers say.</TE>
<TE>   Forman's brother, Charles Henderson, said the family has been
"devastated" by his death, and by Dodd's.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids were young, vibrant, at the top of their game," he
said, adding that Forman had also worked with Jennifer Lopez. "We
don't understand how such a tragedy could have taken their lives from
us," Henderson said. "No one had to die on that plane."</TE>
<TE>   Panish said a Federal Aviation Administration investigation
revealed that the weight of the nine passengers exceeded flight
safety standards even without their luggage and gear. And, he said,
the FBI and FAA suspect that the charter company, hired by Virgin's
video makers, falsified maintenance and aviation logs and lied to
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer alleged Blackhawk had been cited four times in the
previous four years, including for failing to test employees for drug
use. It since has surrendered its operating license to the FAA and
gone out of business. The pilot of the doomed Cessna was not
authorized to fly the plane and had pleaded guilty 12 days earlier to
cocaine possession in a Florida court.</TE>

<HD>Relief Has to Be Fast and Cheap</HD>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>For the Angels, the dollars and sense equation goes something like
this: The more you pay your middle relievers, the less sense it
makes.</LD>
<LD>   So it's a rite of winter for the Angels to shed a veteran and
potentially expensive middle reliever--Mike Magnante two years ago,
Mark Petkovsek last year, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Mike Holtz this
year. On a team with visions of contention, that puts a burden on the
front office, scouts and minor league coaches to find and develop
relievers of comparable quality at a cheaper price.</LD>
<LD>   There is no better way to demoralize a team than to employ an
All-Star closer, such as the Angels' Troy Percival, but be unable to
use him to save games because middle relievers repeatedly blow leads.
The Angels have weathered the losses of Magnante and Petkovsek, and
General Manager Bill Stoneman is confident that his bullpen will
flourish without Hasegawa and Holtz. Economically, he says, he has no
choice.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to decide the value of each player, and relief guys
other than the closer don't get paid like closers or first basemen or
outfielders," Stoneman said. "The Yankees might be an exception, but
they can afford to be an exception."</TE>
<TE>   So can two of the Angels' AL West rivals. The Yankees set a
standard by signing Steve Karsay for three years and $22.5 million,
but the Texas Rangers signed Jay Powell for three years and $9
million and Todd Van Poppel for three years and $7.5 million. The
Seattle Mariners last year signed Arthur Rhodes for four years and
$13 million and Jeff Nelson for three years and $10.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will pay Terry Mulholland $3 million this year, less
than the Angels will pay for all five relievers who will set up
Percival. Their success reflects the organizational success in
finding them, particularly for Lou Pote, signed as a minor league
free agent, and Al Levine and Ben Weber, claimed on waivers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels could get burned, of course, but not as expensively as
the Rangers did with Petkovsek: After he pitched two solid seasons in
Anaheim, the Rangers signed him for $5 million over two years, then
released him after one and ate the whole salary after he posted a
6.69 earned-run average last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Wise started the Angels' Cactus League opener Wednesday,
working two innings and giving up four singles and one run in a 3-2
loss to the San Diego Padres. Wise is unlikely to crack the rotation
but would be the Angels' first choice in case of injury to one of the
top five starters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn said he is receptive to the Angels' interest in
signing him to a long-term contract. After a 2000 season interrupted
by biceps and shoulder injuries, Washburn pitched 193 innings last
season and said he completed a physical therapy program in the
off-season designed to add strength and flexibility to his pitching
shoulder. "I feel stronger now than I ever have," he said.</TE>

<HD>Oester: Griffey Hurt the Reds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Jr.'s habit of arriving late and skipping pregame
practice caused divisiveness in the Cincinnati Reds' clubhouse,
former coach Ron Oester told The Cincinnati Enquirer in a story
published Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Oester, a minor league infield instructor with the Philadelphia
Phillies, joined former Reds Pokey Reese and Dmitri Young in citing
Griffey's special treatment as a factor in Cincinnati's decline the
last two years.</LD>
<LD>   "Junior's not a bad guy," Oester told the paper. "He just needs a
little discipline. He wants discipline. His weakness is being a
teammate.</LD>
<TE>   "When you've got a team and you do everything together and you
have one or two guys who don't ... you have problems."</TE>
<TE>   Griffey missed the Reds' workout Wednesday at Sarasota, Fla.,
because of a stomach viral infection.</TE>
<TE>   Oester was one of two coaches fired by Red Manager Bob Boone after
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Reese, now with Pittsburgh, and Young, now with Detroit, said
after they reported to their new teams that the Reds lost their
chemistry after Griffey arrived in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Florida Marlin owner John Henry and his partners completed
their record $660-million purchase of the Boston Red Sox, ending
seven decades of ownership by the Yawkey family and its trust.</TE>
<TE>   Two players, two coaches and a clubhouse attendant for the Seattle
Mariners tested positive for tuberculosis, but chest X-rays showed
that none have the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The five people were not identified by the Mariners, who tested
more than 60 players, coaches and other personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is in any danger, no one will miss any time," team doctor
Mitch Storey told The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mariner shortstop Carlos Guillen sat out the final nine
games of the regular season after contracting tuberculosis.</TE>

<LD>Under the headline "Knicks Get Pulled Like a Bad Sitcom," Ira Berkow
of the New York Times wrote: "One might think the Knicks are running
out of things to be embarrassed about, but Saturday brought about
even more distressing news for their pummeled egos.</LD>
<LD>   "The Knicks have been dropped from four national television
broadcasts: next Sunday against San Antonio, March 24 at Philadelphia
and March 31 at Orlando, all on NBC, and April 2 against Charlotte on
TNT....</LD>
<LD>   "Now, you often hear of soap operas or sitcoms being canceled by
the networks. But basketball games due to anticipated dullness?"</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was USC's first consensus All-American in
basketball?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Listen up: Phil Rogers in the Chicago Tribune wrote that Hall of
Famer Al Kaline is in the Detroit Tiger camp working with young
hitters. And he had no trouble getting their attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell you exactly what Ted Williams, the greatest
hitter who ever lived, told me when I was 18 years old: 'Young man,
you get yourself a good pitch. Don't get yourself out. These pitchers
will give you a good pitch to hit if you're patient.</TE>
<TE>   "'Then when you get it, hit it hard. If you can do that, you can
play in the big leagues.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk is cheap: San Francisco Giant relief pitcher Jason
Christiansen when asked what Olympic sport he could see himself in:
"Hockey. Heck yeah. Definitely a defenseman, right at the net,
keeping them out of the crease. I'd just sit on the bench until they
wanted somebody knocked out. I'd be more than happy to go in there
and fire somebody into the boards."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He has a point: New York Met catcher Mike Piazza is a movie buff.
He gave a state-of-Hollywood address to the New York Post: "You know
what bums me out? There are no more John Wayne movies. There are a
bunch of guys who won the medal of honor in Vietnam. All the Vietnam
movies and not one is about those guys.</TE>
<TE>   "Show me the story. Don't always show me the guys who got blown
apart.... But show me a hero story over there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Silent treatment: Utah Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan commenting on
39-year-old John Stockton, who is closing in on 15,000 assists: "You
hear less about him than anybody in the league. The [lack of]
recognition he receives for what he has done amazes me. He's a
superstar to me. But he doesn't get that kind of respect, and I don't
know why."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1965, Nate Thurmond of the San
Francisco Warriors set the NBA record for most rebounds in one
quarter with 18 against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jerry Nemer in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: As general manager of the youthful Atlanta Hawks,
Pete Babcock wants to prevent his young players from getting stale on
the road. So he organizes field trips.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the team recently toured our nation's missile
defense system, NORAD, during a side trip to Colorado Springs, Colo.
Earlier trips have included a tour of Ford's Theater in Washington,
where President Lincoln was shot, and a visit to the Texas Book
Depository, the site of President Kennedy's assassination.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my guys to have life experiences that go beyond
basketball," Babcock told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</TE>

<LD>If all goes as planned, the Clippers will do better than merely tread
water in the next few weeks and all their injured players will return
at top form, leading a playoff push in the final days of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "That's my hallucination," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "That's what I
would like to happen, anyway."</LD>
<LD>   Center Michael Olowokandi on Wednesday had an MRI exam on his
sprained left knee and backup point guard Keyon Dooling had one on
his injured left ankle.</LD>
<TE>   The results will be made available today, after the team's medical
staff has reviewed both.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the team announced small forward Corey Maggette will
soon undergo arthroscopic surgery on his sore left knee, which has
been troubling him for several months.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers thought it best for Maggette to take care of the knee
trouble while he is sidelined because of dislocated bones in his
right hand. His knee is expected to be sound before his hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Rocket guard Steve Francis has at least one young fan in
Southern California, Gentry's 4-year-old son, Ryan. Gentry secured a
Francis bobble-head doll for his son, although he joked about
performing voodoo on it before Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to drip some chicken blood on it and stick it with some
needles," Gentry said. Adopting a more serious tone, he later added,
"He's one of the most gifted players in the league. I love the way he
plays."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper forward Elton Brand, who was an Atlantic Coast Conference
rival while playing for Duke against Francis' Maryland teams, also is
an admirer. Brand and Francis were the first two players selected in
the 1999 draft and were also chosen co-rookies of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finally getting a chance to beat him after losing most of the
time when I was playing with the Bulls," Brand said. "It will be a
nice competition for both of us for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Brand continues to earn praise around the NBA for his blue-collar
style of play.</TE>
<TE>   "He's solid, he's granite," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
after Brand had 26 points and 15 rebounds in the Clippers' 94-84
victory Tuesday. "Granite gets it done."</TE>

<HD>Couples Sounds Like Major General</HD>
<DH>Golf: 1992 Masters champion is driving force behind
proposed tour for former winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Couples, the player behind the proposed Major Champions Tour,
says he's not only willing to give up his PGA Tour card to play it,
he's also convinced the new tour is going to become a reality.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure the thing is going to make it," Couples said. "It's
going to be a big deal, and in five years, it's going to be a huge
deal."</LD>
<LD>   Couples is the architect of the planned tour for 2003 that would
feature only players between 37 and 55 who have won major
championships.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pretty excited about it," Couples said. "I've been behind it
from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Couples says he has no interest in playing the senior tour when he
turns 50 in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to play the senior tour," he said. "I don't want Tim
Finchem to say, 'commit to this,' 'play this,' 'do this' because I'm
one of the new guys on the block. I don't want to have to play 20
tournaments to make the senior tour go."</TE>
<TE>   Couples, who will be 43 in October, has won 14 times in 22 years
on the PGA Tour, including the 1992 Masters, but slowed by a bad back
and a reluctance to play more often, he has won only twice since
1997. Last year, Couples played only 19 tournaments and had his worst
season on the money list since 1986 at No. 131.</TE>
<TE>   Couples hasn't played more than 20 PGA Tour events in a year since
1992 and he says the prospects of continuing to struggle at his age
prompted him to come up with the concept of the proposed tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't shoot the same scores as I used to, but I'm still
competitive in my own range," he said. "But I'm not in the
[Accenture] Match Play, I'm not in the top 64, where am I going?</TE>
<TE>   "If I have a putt to win a tournament, I want to play in the last
group with a Greg Norman or a Nick Faldo or a Nicky Price. For me to
win another tournament, that would be great for about a week, but it
wouldn't be anything to make my 20-year career or whatever any
better.</TE>
<TE>   "If I play like I did last year and keep deteriorating, and the
PGA Tour is tough, there's nowhere for me to play golf."</TE>
<TE>   Couples contends that the Major Champions Tour would bring out the
best in an age group that is no longer interested in grinding it out,
week to week, on the PGA Tour. The list of players who would be
eligible to play in the tour includes Norman, Faldo, Price, Mark
O'Meara, Paul Azinger, Steve Elkington, Bernhard Langer, Tom Lehman,
John Daly, Tom Watson, Ian Woosnam, Curtis Strange and Mark
Calcavecchia. There are 35 players who meet the age criterion in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Players would have to give up their PGA Tour cards to join the new
tour, which would be viable only with a network television agreement
and corporate sponsorship. Terry Jastrow, an independent television
producer, is working to line up a television deal, perhaps with Fox,
and to find sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   So far, representatives of the PGA Tour have had little reaction
to the proposed tour, except to say they would not want tournament
dates to conflict, which is a certainty to occur. For instance, in
the new tour's model plan for a possible 2003 schedule, the first
tentative date would be the second week of March opposite the Honda
Classic, the second date would be the fourth week of March opposite
Houston and the third date would be the fourth week of April opposite
Greensboro.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, not only would the PGA Tour's events, albeit those of
lesser stature, conflict with those on the new tour, but they would
also go on without some players who would normally be in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it affect the PGA Tour? Sure it does," Couples said. "But
nothing against the PGA Tour, there's just a right time for this
thing to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for six to eight Major Champions Tour events, each with
a purse of $2 million, played at courses that have hosted major
championships, such as Merion, Winged Foot and Oakland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Couples says the period of time between when a player is no longer
regularly competitive on the PGA Tour and when a player is eligible
for the Senior PGA Tour at 50 are "wasted years."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Couples did not have a top-10 finish in the 19
tournaments he entered and earned $385,984.</TE>
<TE>   He remains exempt on the PGA Tour through 2006 as a result of his
victory in the 1996 Players Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of years has been a struggle," he said. "If I go
to a regular tour event and I have a one o'clock tee time and the
leaders are five, six, seven under and I'm at even par after three
holes, that hole gets smaller and smaller and smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to feel that way. And I'm not the only one who feels
that way, either."</TE>

<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Talks between the Dodgers and a representative for Matt Herges on a
multiyear contract broke off Wednesday, leaving the Dodger reliever
jilted and challenging his loyalty to the organization.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very disappointing," said Herges, who was the team's setup
man last season and is in line to become the closer this year. "They
obviously think I'm just an average reliever, and I don't think of
myself like that, but they're the ones who have all the power right
now."</LD>
<LD>   Herges, who went 9-8 with a 3.44 earned-run average in 75 games
last season, said earlier this week that he loves playing for the
Dodgers and hopes he isn't traded, but he admitted it will feel
"different" walking into the clubhouse this morning.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone says it's a business, go pitch your butt off this year
and prove them wrong; then I'll be arbitration-eligible, and I'll
hold the cards," Herges said. "Actually, this woke me up. Now I know
how they feel about me, and it lit a fire under me. I want to have a
great year, and we'll take care of business next year."</TE>
<TE>   Herges, 32, has a little more than two years' big league service
time, so he's not eligible for arbitration until next winter. Agent
Dan Horwits would not reveal the amount of the Dodgers' last offer,
but a source familiar with negotiations said it was for two years and
$1.17 million, $370,000 this year and $800,000 in 2003. Horwits hopes
to negotiate a one-year deal before Saturday's contract renewal
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "They're comparing Matt to middle relievers, and we feel Matt's
value is a lot higher," Horwits said. "That's where the disagreement
is."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers used middle relievers such as St. Louis' Steve Kline
(3-3, 1.80 ERA in 89 games last season), Florida's Braden Looper
(3-3, 3.55 ERA in 71 games), Colorado's Jose Paniagua (4-3, 4.36 ERA
in 60 games for Seattle) and Pittsburgh's Scott Sauerbeck (2-2, 5.60
ERA in 70 games) as their comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   The four, all of whom have more than three years' service time,
made between $400,000 and $837,500 last season. Horwits thought
Herges should be compared to higher-paid setup men such as
Milwaukee's Chad Fox, who recently signed for $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most difficult things about a negotiation is sometimes
it doesn't work," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. "The problem
here was knowing what his role is. This was merely a difference of
opinion based on what his value is and the uncertainty of his role.
In no way does this affect how we feel about Matt as a player and a
person. We value him highly."</TE>
<TE>   Forgive Herges if he doesn't feel the love.</TE>
<TE>   "I love L.A. and I don't want to go anywhere, but it kind of hurts
that they don't feel the same way about me that some other people
do," Herges said. "I understand it's a business and you can't take it
personal, but I'm a human being. It's tough, and it's going to take a
while to get over it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Alex Cora suffered a bruised left shoulder diving for a
flare during an intrasquad game Wednesday. The injury is not believed
to be serious, but it will prevent Cora from playing in today's
Grapefruit League opener against the Florida Marlins.... Eric Gagne
and Odalis Perez, who are battling for the fifth spot in the
rotation, will pitch against the Marlins today. Omar Daal, another
candidate for the fifth spot, will start Friday against Houston....
After a six-pitch, three-up, three-down first inning, Hideo Nomo gave
up a run on two hits in the second inning of the intrasquad game.
Nomo will make his first exhibition start Sunday against Florida....
Kevin Brown continued his recovery from elbow surgery with a 60-pitch
bullpen workout. "I'm happy with the way things are going," Brown
said. "I'm on the mound, I'm throwing, and it doesn't hurt. That's a
plus."</TE>

<HD>Astros Rid Selves of Enron</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Houston will pay disgraced company to remove name
from stadium, which will now be called Astros Field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Astros used to play in the Astrodome, a name that proudly
reflected the city's leading role in America's space program and the
architectural wonder of the first domed stadium in the country. Then
the Astros moved into Enron Field, a name that now reflects a
nationally disgraced company and a sports industry increasingly
greedy for corporate cash.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the largest corporate bankruptcy in American
history, with thousands of jobs and millions in life savings lost,
the Enron name will be stripped from the ballpark. The Astros agreed
Wednesday to pay the Houston-based company $2.1 million to terminate
a contract that otherwise could have forced the baseball team to
welcome fans to Enron Field, in what would have been a daily reminder
of an almost unimaginable hometown scandal.</LD>
<LD>   In its mightier days, the energy company agreed to pay the Astros
$100 million over 30 years for the right to slap its name on the
ballpark. Although the Astros argued in court papers that the Enron
Field name has harmed and embarrassed the team, and although these
shaky economic times might suggest caution before making another
corporate association, team owner Drayton McLane said the ballpark
would be renamed Astros Field only until another company agrees to
pay for naming rights.</LD>
<TE>   In an era of escalating costs, most notably spiraling player
salaries, teams tap every revenue source they can. While older
ballparks such as Dodger Stadium, New York's Yankee Stadium,
Chicago's Wrigley Field and Boston's Fenway Park carry traditional
names honoring teams, owners or geographical areas, the name of new
ballparks is generally reserved for the highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams are not going to walk away from $100-million contracts to
go back to the days of nostalgia," said Dean Bonham, whose Denver
sports consulting firm represents corporations interested in
acquiring naming rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros nonetheless went to bankruptcy court earlier this
month, seeking approval to dump the Enron name even though the
company had not missed a payment to the team and was not scheduled to
make another until Sept. 1. The settlement, expected to be approved
by the court, was applauded by Bonham.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best investment the Astros have made since [signing
star] Jeff Bagwell," Bonham said. "The alternative could have cost
them millions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, the Astros suggested that the Enron name could
alienate fans and sponsors from the team. The Enron name is on three
stadium entrances, four faces of a clock tower and in several hundred
places around the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bonham: "If you have just lost your job and your life
savings, or if someone in your family has, how are you going to feel
about walking through a door with the Enron Field name on it?"</TE>
<TE>   The team also argued in court, "The Astros are being perceived in
the public and cast in the national media as an affiliate [and even
an ally] of Enron even though the Astros have done nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Enron name is the fifth to fall from a sports facility.
PSINet, an Internet service provider that also has filed for
bankruptcy, agreed this month to remove its name from the Baltimore
Ravens' football stadium. The names of two Florida sports facilities,
Pro Player Stadium and National Car Rental Center, reflect brands of
parent companies that have filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The TWA Dome name vanished last year from the St. Louis Rams'
stadium, following the airline's bankruptcy and subsequent purchase
by American Airlines. Stadium officials renamed the facility the Dome
at America's Center and, after an extended search, sold naming rights
last month to the brokerage firm Edward Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Airline mergers and the bust in the high-tech sector have
eliminated many companies from industries commonly interested in
acquiring naming rights; the slumping economy depressing rights fees.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron debacle highlights a new concern that a naming rights
agreement, no matter how lucrative, might ultimately come back to
haunt the team. "Teams have to be very concerned," said David Carter,
who teaches sports business at USC. "They're going to have to
scrutinize the firm as much as the firm has to scrutinize the merits
of being attached to the team."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, McLane said he already had heard
from "six or seven major companies" interested in replacing the Enron
name with theirs and said he hoped to conclude a deal within two
months. Although the Astros reported $125 million in revenue last
season, they also reported a $9-million loss, according to figures
released by baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "The naming rights in professional sports facilities is a very
important part," McLane said. "That revenue goes into operating the
club. For the Houston Astros, all the money that we have received
from the naming rights basically goes to funding players' salaries."</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the California energy crisis darkened the reputation of
Edison, but the Angels sat tight and a 20-year, $50-million deal to
call their ballpark Edison Field survived.</TE>
<TE>   And, when the NBA's Charlotte Hornets agreed to move to New
Orleans, officials there agreed that the team could sell naming
rights to New Orleans Arena and keep all the profits.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't put the genie back in the bottle," Carter said. "The
genie is those tens and hundreds of millions of dollars."</TE>

<LD>Ty Tryon may have turned heads when he qualified for the PGA Tour at
17, but a Hawaiian girl is making that look like child's play.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Wie, 12, became the youngest golfer to qualify for an
LPGA Tour event, shooting an 83 at Waikoloa Beach Resort on Monday in

<TE>   Woods, in Miami for the Genuity Championship, declined to say how
much he was paid for the two-day exhibition or how much he paid in
taxes. But he was surprised to hear that he was the top taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's actually pretty funny," Woods said. "But it's not that
funny."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Who?</TE>
<TE>   David Salinas of Boston won a contest sponsored by a golf company

<HD>Kings' Effort Is Still Top of the Line</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Allison, Deadmarsh and Palffy combine for two goals
and six points in 5-4 victory over Penguins. L.A. moves within three
points of first.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>The way Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh and Ziggy Palffy are playing,
it really doesn't matter who's coaching the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings' top line was cooking again Wednesday night as it
combined for two goals and six points to lead the Kings to a 5-4
victory over the Mario Lemieux-led Pittsburgh Penguins before 16,134
at Mellon Center.</LD>
<LD>   "If we want to make the playoffs, our best players are going to
have to be our best players and so far after the break, those three
guys have been our best players," King forward Ian Laperriere said.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings (29-20-8-3) are 21-6-4-1 over their last 32 games and
have moved within three points of  first-place San Jose in the
Pacific Division. Even with ailing Coach Andy Murray away from  the
team because of post-concussion syndrome, the Kings have continued to
roll under interim Coach Dave Tippett.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though there are some things we want to work on in our game,
we got two wins out of the [Olympic break] and that's good," said
Tippett, who talked with Murray early Wednesday about the Kings.
"It's unfortunate that [Murray] can't be here to see it but
hopefully, he'll get back quick."</TE>
<TE>   For the second night in a row, the Kings fell behind early on  a
fluke goal. On Tuesday, Columbus jumped out to a 1-0 lead thanks to
poor communication by the Kings. On Wednesday, it was referee Kevin
Maguire's skate that led to the Penguins' first goal.</TE>
<TE>   After a faceoff in the Kings' zone, the puck ricocheted off
Maguire to wide-open Pittsburgh forward Jan Hrdina, who beat Jamie
Storr 5:54 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the Kings to not only tie the score but
also open up a two-goal lead. Allison sliced through the Penguins'
defense and scored the Kings' first goal 66 seconds after Hrdina's
score.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings scored two goals 32 seconds apart when Mikko Eloranta
knocked the puck  in off a great pass from Laperriere, and Deadmarsh
powered in a score to give the Kings a 3-1 lead at 12:19.</TE>
<TE>   "They carried on where they left off from [Tuesday night],"
Tippett said about the Allison-Deadmarsh-Palffy line, which combined
for four goals and 10 points against the Blue Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Over their last seven games, the Kings' top trio has combined for
15 goals and 35 points. Deadmarsh has five goals and seven assists,
Allison has three goals and nine assists, and Palffy has seven goals
and four assists.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see it in their eyes that they want to be the best
players on the ice," Tippett added. "They want to take the bull by
the horns and lead the team in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings led, 3-2, after one period before breaking the game open
in the second with a power-play goal from Jaroslav Modry and an
even-strength goal from Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   Modry scored his fourth goal when he was left alone in front of
the net as  two Pittsburgh defenders followed Deadmarsh. Allison
found Modry to give the Kings a 4-2 lead at 6:45.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere stretched the Kings' lead to three goals with his
eighth on a slap shot from inside the blue line at 11:17. Since
returning from the Olympic break, Laperriere and his linemates, Brad
Chartrand and Eloranta, have provided the Kings with unexpected
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "The more plays you make, the more confidence you get in yourself
and your linemates," Laperriere said. "It's really enjoyable to work
with those two guys."</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, Pittsburgh defenseman Janne Laukkanen scored
his second goal of the game at 5:15 and Alexei Kovalev added a  goal
with 11.7 seconds remaining. Kovalev's goal came 20 seconds after the
video replay judge waived off a goal by Lemieux, ruling he directed
the puck in with his skate.</TE>
<TE>   For Storr, who finished with 23 saves in his first action since
defeating Buffalo on Jan. 17, the highlight of the night was to play
against Lemieux, who recorded his 1,600th point on Laukkanen's
second-period power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of fun," said Storr, who improve to 8-4-3. "I got to
play with and against Gretz [Wayne Gretzky] but I had never played
against Mario. He's still an unbelievable hockey player and he makes
everyone around him better."</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Sid Hartman, columnist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, has been
around since the days of the Minneapolis Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   As a matter of fact, as that team's general manager, he helped
form the NBA's first dynasty, a team that won five NBA championships.</LD>
<LD>   So he should be happy that the Lakers are planning on raising two
banners at Staples Center on April 11 when the Lakers again play the
Minnesota Timberwolves, one to represent the five titles, the others
to honor the five Hall of Famers and the Hall of Fame coach on those
teams.</LD>
<TE>   The five players are George Mikan, Vern Mikkelsen, Clyde
Lovellette, Jim Pollard and Slater Martin, The coach is John Kundla.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Hartman is angry is took so long for the recognition to
come.</TE>
<TE>   "Out there, they think they're bigger than everybody else,"
Hartman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hartman says the Laker move west in 1960 probably wouldn't have
happened if management had followed his advice in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Hartman and a lot of others felt the next superstar
was going to be Bill Russell from the University of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "If we would have finished last that season," Hartman said, "we
would have drafted Russell and, with that team, we wouldn't have left
here."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman decided trading Mikkelsen would be enough to sink the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   So he worked out a deal with the Boston Celtics, Mikkelsen in
exchange for the rights to three Kentucky players--Cliff Hagan, Frank
Ramsey and Lou Tsiropoulas.</TE>
<TE>   But at the last minute, Celtic owner Walter Brown wanted out of
the deal and Ben Berger, who outranked Hartman, agreed to kill the
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman was so incensed he quit.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, Boston wound up with Russell.</TE>
<TE>   Russell playing with Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. Think of the
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about the acquisition of backup center Marc Jackson last
week from the Golden State Warriors at the trading deadline,
Minnesota guard Wally Szczerbiak had nothing but nice things to say
about Jackson ... and nothing but scorn for the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   "He plays the game the way it should be played," Szczerbiak told
the Star Tribune. "I never heard anyone talk more on defense and on
offense ....He's not built for a bunch of clowns like they've got out
at Golden State. He needs to play with players who know how to play."</TE>
<TE>   That would be good bulletin-board material for most teams. But
considering the Warriors had won only 15 of 54 games before beating
Denver on Wednesday night, they have a lot more to worry about than
Wally Szczerbiak.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Billups gets hot for the Timberwolves, who
end L.A.'s five-game trip on a sour note, 112-101.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Lakers were facing a hot team on a cold night in a hostile arena.
They were playing in their fifth city in seven days. They were
playing their second game in as many nights. They were up against a
point guard who couldn't miss, a superstar at the top of his game and
a newly arrived big body banging his way into a significant role.</LD>
<LD>   Despite all that, the Lakers asked their tired legs to carry them
through one more rally Wednesday night at Target Center, to sink a
few more clutch baskets, to grab a few more key rebounds, to extend
their winning streak to five games and conclude a perfect trip.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't happen. Perfection was beyond their grasp.</LD>
<TE>   And so were the Minnesota Timberwolves, in particular Chauncey
Billups and Kevin Garnett.</TE>
<TE>   Behind by 13 at the half, the Lakers cut the deficit to seven
points in the fourth quarter, but they never got closer, losing,
112-101, in front of an exuberant sellout crowd of 19,769.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers fell to 39-17. Minnesota is 39-18.</TE>
<TE>   "Four and one. That's not a bad road trip," Laker guard Kobe
Bryant said. "I'm pleased with that."</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't pleased with the way his legs and his shot deserted
him in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   In city after city on this trip, Bryant has dazzled with his
deadly shot, lightning moves and overall command of the court.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday night in the final half of the final game, he
lost his touch. Bryant was one for 10 from the floor in the last 24
minutes, finishing the night eight for 25. He finished with 20 points
and managed to hand out 11 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a good job on him," Coach Phil Jackson said. "He missed
some real easy shots in the first half. Every time he didn't convert
in there, they would run on us. That was pretty tough."</TE>
<TE>   So tough that Jackson took out Bryant for about 21/2 minutes with
51/2 to go in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have a good night," Jackson said of Bryant. "I thought
that at that point, we needed to go in another direction."</TE>
<TE>   The other direction Jackson goes, whether Bryant is misfiring or
not, is center Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal managed to score 27 points,
although he made only eight of 19 from the floor. But, subjected to
the usual human barrage in the paint, O'Neal was uncharacteristically
effective from the free-throw line, sinking 11 of 15, a 73% success
rate.</TE>
<TE>   On some nights against lesser teams, that might be enough. But not
Wednesday night when Minnesota guard Billups was nearly unstoppable,
scoring 30 points while making 10 of 15 from the floor, including
seven of eight from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   And Billups wasn't even the highest-scoring Timberwolf on the
floor. That would be Garnett, who had 33 points (14 of 25 from the
floor) and a game-high 15 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great feeling, man," Billups said of his big night,
"especially against a team like that."</TE>
<TE>   Billups, now in his fifth year, has been starting in place of
Terrell Brandon, out because of a fractured leg, and making the most
of it. Last week, he had a career-high 36 points against the Dallas
Mavericks, including a club-record 24 in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers threw both Derek Fisher and Lindsey Hunter against
Billups, but neither could cool him down.</TE>
<TE>   "Fisher, he's a bulldog, a strong guy and real cerebral," Billups
said. 'And Lindsey Hunter has those big, long arms. But when you get
going like that, sometimes you just know the ball is going in the
basket. The basket just gets bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher was quick to give Billups credit.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you shoot like that, you're in a groove," Fisher said.
"But we gave him some looks he shouldn't have had."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota forward Wally Szczerbiak, who helped shut down Bryant,
added 14 points, and newly acquired Marc Jackson added 12 while
leaning his 6-10, 270-pound body heavily on O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was acquired last week at the trading deadline from the
Golden State Warriors for center Dean Garrett and the Timberwolves'
second-round draft pick in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't stop Shaq," Jackson said, "but I came ready to play,
ready to hit and hoped he would miss his shots."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he already feels like he fits in.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are on the court," he said, "you are a family."</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers began this trip, they were in the throes of the
first three-game losing streak of the Phil Jackson era in Los
Angeles. Winning four out of five on the road would have sounded
pretty good when they left.</TE>
<TE>   So, Jackson was asked, was this loss excusable in light of the
overall success of the trip?</TE>
<TE>   "Losing," said Jackson, "is not excusable."</TE>

<HD>No Quit in Her</HD>
<DH>1986 Surprise Mosqueda Returns as a Favorite, but Seeking a
Sponsor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighteen miles into the Los Angeles Marathon, Sylvia Mosqueda was
going strong. Her legs felt good, her breathing was relaxed and she
had a two-minute lead on the second-place woman. So far ahead was
Mosqueda, an unknown 19-year-old from East L.A. College, the TV
commentators were writing her off as a fluke, a showboat.</LD>
<LD>   Then, at the 19-mile mark, she stunned everyone.</LD>
<LD>   She abruptly slowed to a walk, calmly made her way to the
sidewalk, pulled off her shoes and socks, and happily wriggled her
toes.</LD>
<TE>   "What are you doing?" an onlooker pleaded. "You were winning by
two minutes!"</TE>
<TE>   "Winning what?" Mosqueda asked with her wry smile. "I didn't enter
the race."</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years have passed since that spectacular training run--she
hopped into the start of the 1986 race on a whim--and it proved to be
the world's first hint of Mosqueda's potential. Officially entered,
she finished second in the L.A. Marathon in 1987, third in 1990, and
now, at 35, she's among the favorites in the women's race on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from L.A., and it's about time I get my butt out there and
win this thing," she said this week, taking a break from a workout at
Cal State Los Angeles, where she emerged as a star runner in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda is petite and wiry strong. She looks effortless when she
runs. Her head never bobs, her shoulders look relaxed. She has a
roadrunner tattoo on one shoulder blade and a cheetah on one thigh.</TE>
<TE>   She's known for bolting to the front of the pack, "suicidal
starts," some people call them. At times, it seems the only way she
feels comfortable is when she's running alone, free from the
claustrophobic cluster.</TE>
<TE>   Her coach, Jim McClatchy, lives in Houston, and she has met him
only once since they began working together in November. They
communicate by e-mail. He sends her detailed workouts. She replies
with times and updates.</TE>
<TE>   "I love his workouts," said Mosqueda, who lives in Highland Park.
"I believe in them."</TE>
<TE>   But it makes for a lot of solitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough, because I'm out here alone," she said. "You have to
be a pretty disciplined athlete to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, she's joined by her longtime friend, Victor Morales, a
former Cal State L.A. runner who mans the stopwatch when he isn't
trying to keep pace with her.</TE>
<TE>   Morales knows better than anyone how difficult it is to slow
Mosqueda. The end of one of her workouts this week was almost
comical. Mosqueda wanted to run a 5-minute, 40-second mile, the pace
she's aiming for in the marathon.</TE>
<TE>   First, she ran 5:12.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what cannot happen in L.A.," she said, shaking her head.
"Bad, bad, bad."</TE>
<TE>   Then, she ran 5:13.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm supposed to tell her to slow down," Morales said, studying
his watch. "But sometimes there's no point."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after vowing to run the first quarter-mile at a granny's
pace, she whisked in with another 5:12.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a coach here, they'll stop you," she said later.
"They'll make you do it all over again until you get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Morales doesn't bother. He's a friend, not a coach. "You'll hear a
lot of coaches tell their runners to pick it up," he said. "No one
ever said that to Sylvia."</TE>
<TE>   Marathons are a new focus for Mosqueda, who has tried several
distances during her career. In 1988, she won the 10,000 meters and
was sixth in the 5,000 at the NCAA championships. She has ranked
among the top 10 women in the U.S. in several events over the years.</TE>
<TE>   She has qualified for the Olympic trials four consecutive times
since 1988, and in 1987 ran a 12k in 38:38, an American record that
is three seconds off the world record.</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda recently decided to concentrate on the discipline because
she has felt her strength and endurance increase over the past few
years. She plans to run the Chicago Marathon in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "My body tells me it's time to move up," she said. "Women tend to
get stronger as they get older; men get slower."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, when the barriers before her seem especially daunting,
she feels like a hurdler. Her biggest frustration is her inability to
find a sponsor. Lots of other runners--many of whom she has
beaten--have lucrative deals that provide a stipend and free shoes
and apparel. Mosqueda lives off her race winnings and a part-time
salary from Run With US, a Pasadena running store.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of motivation and desire out of an athlete when I
could go out there and set a world record, and I know there's not
going to be anything waiting for me at the end," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she floated a theory: "Is it because I don't have blond hair
and blue eyes? Is it because I'm Latin? I just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, whose background is as a business consultant, helped her
land a shoe deal earlier in her career, but that contract expired
long ago. Lately, the two have sought potential sponsors in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough as an athlete not knowing," she said. "What did I ever
do so wrong that all the doors are shut? All I've ever done is run
fast."</TE>
<TE>   That could be enough Sunday for the woman who grew up with five
sisters in East L.A., raised and inspired by a mother who hasn't
walked for 30 years because of rheumatoid arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother's a very strong woman," Mosqueda said. "My sisters and
I got that from her."</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda's parents separated when she was 5, and she has remained
close to both. Her mother, Dolores, has never watched her compete in
person but will be watching Sunday's telecast. Her father, Guadalupe,
is a former boxer who lives in Mexicali, Mexico, and keeps close tabs
on her career.</TE>
<TE>   Mosqueda is particularly close to her sister Rosalinda, who ran in
the 1994 marathon to inspire Sylvia, and finished the race despite
never running more than a few miles in a day. Meanwhile, Sylvia
dropped out after 16 miles and wound up in the hospital because of
dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'Hey, you're bad luck,'" Sylvia said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, spectators will cheer as Mosqueda glides through the
streets of her hometown. And she will appreciate those cheers, even
if they won't sound the same to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hear anybody when I'm running," she said. "I'm not
looking for any flowers out there. I just run hard and focused. In my
own little world."</TE>
<TE>   Alone again. Naturally.</TE>

<HD>Miami Feels Heat From 76ers, Riley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outside the Miami Heat locker room, Coach Pat Riley could be heard
screaming obscenities at his team.</LD>
<LD>   "Just awful. We didn't come out ready to fight," Riley said in
disgust after the Heat missed a chance to gain ground in the race for
the playoffs, losing to the 76ers, 82-72, Wednesday night at
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Allen Iverson scored 31 points before leaving with 1:11 left
because of a thigh bruise, and the 76ers survived poor free-throw
shooting to end Miami's two-game winning streak and move back to .500
(28-28) for the seventh time in the last six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The Heat had won 15 of 20 after a 5-23 start. Miami is 11th in the
conference and could have moved within two games of eighth-place
Philadelphia with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand. They have a sense of well-being since we
won a few games," Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in there moaning about the officiating--and it was one of
the worst I've ever been around in a big game--but they had the same
opportunities to take the ball to the basket. Instead, they stood
around and took jump shots. That's who we are."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia shot 18 free throws in the fourth quarter and
finished with a season-high 46.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat did not attempt a free throw in the final 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 101, Chicago 89--Jon Barry scored 21 points for the
Pistons and matched a career-high with 10 assists in replacing Jerry
Stackhouse, who sat out at Auburn Hills, Mich., to rest a shoulder
sprain.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 105, Washington 101--Rasheed Wallace had 22 points and 14
rebounds, and the Trail Blazers won their seventh in a row by pulling
away with a 12-2 run to open the fourth quarter at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards shot 56% through three quarters but went cold in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 98, Atlanta 81--The SuperSonics won their eighth in a row
on the road and Gary Payton had 12 assists to move into 14th place in
the NBA career assist list with 6,517.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 24 points and 16 rebounds for Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 90, Toronto 85--Tracy McGrady scored 24 points for the
Magic at Toronto, and the Raptors didn't score in the final 4:54 en
route to their ninth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 95, Boston 92--The Bucks beat the Celtics for the fourth
consecutive time behind Sam Cassell's 26 points at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 104, New Jersey 85--Jamal Mashburn, playing in his sixth
game after sitting out 42 because of a strained abdominal muscle,
scored a season-high 36 points at Charlotte, N.C., to help halt the
Nets' six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 110, Denver 93--Antawn Jamison had 26 points and 12
rebounds at Oakland and the Warriors ended a seven-game losing
streak.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The way has been paved for John Madden to move from Fox to ABC's
"Monday Night Football" booth, beginning next season.</LD>
<LD>   Fox on Wednesday granted permission to Madden's representatives
from International Management Group to talk with ABC, according to
sources.</LD>
<LD>   By granting permission, Fox negated the final year of Madden's
contract, which pays him $8million a year. If Madden is unable to
work out a deal with ABC, he will have to negotiate a new deal with
Fox, which presumably would pay considerably less. ABC may offer
Madden around $5 million a year.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives from ABC and Fox declined comment, but it is
assumed that if Madden goes to ABC, the "Monday Night Football" team
would consist of Al Michaels and Madden.</TE>
<TE>   ABC might find another spot for Dan Fouts, and Dennis Miller's
status is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the speculation is that Joe Buck and Cris Collinsworth,
who would move out of the studio, would make up the new No. 1 NFL
announcing team at Fox.</TE>

<LD>Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada, worn out by the whirlwind
that followed their elevation to co-gold medalists with their Russian
rivals at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, won't defend their
world pairs figure skating title.</LD>
<LD>   Sale and Pelletier didn't have time to prepare for the March 15-24
World Championships at Nagano, Japan, because of "the events of the
last two weeks," according to a statement from Skate Canada. "They
have not decided at this point in time whether they will remain
eligible for next year's events."</LD>
<LD>   Sale and Pelletier finished second to Russians Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze at Salt Lake City. However, after a French
judge said she had been pressured to vote for the Russians, the
International Olympic Committee awarded duplicate gold medals to the
Canadian duo.</LD>

<HD>Kariya Is Savoring His Golden Moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The smile just won't go away. Not now, not for a very long time. And
before last weekend, when was the last time anybody saw Paul Kariya
smile?</LD>
<LD>   Kariya was back at the Pond on Wednesday. His Mighty Duck team,
which long ago lost its hopes for the playoffs, began the slog to the
end of the season Wednesday night against Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   For the rest of the season, Kariya will be playing hockey in a
half-empty home arena that will be almost entirely empty of
enthusiasm or hope. The dreadfulness of the Ducks has been going on
for two long years. Kariya has been the good soldier, the star
quietly stuck in the mud.</LD>
<TE>   Then, suddenly, magic filled his life. He played in a sold-out
arena. He played before fans who wouldn't quit cheering. He played
for a nation that wouldn't stop hoping. He has an Olympic gold medal.
His country, Canada, is fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   His hands have become both a cradle and a jail. A warning: Don't
try and take, not even in jest, this medal away from Kariya. Don't
even innocently reach for a touch of the heavy, oddly shaped object.
If you do, Kariya's fingers will close around the medal and he will
stop you with his stare.</TE>
<TE>   But the smile is still there.</TE>
<TE>   It is a smile of joy. It is a smile of relief. It is a smile of
wonder and amazement and if you think pro athletes don't appreciate
the Olympics, don't understand the honor that it was to compete with
countrymen, then look at Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   He sent his mother, Sharon, home to Vancouver from Salt Lake City
with his Canadian team jersey. Kariya gave his mother one order.
Don't put the jersey in checked luggage. So Sharon wore the jersey
home. Unwashed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was covered with tears, sweat and champagne," Kariya said. "It
was covered with everything I went through to get here."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in a corridor outside the Mighty Duck locker room
Wednesday morning, wearing faded blue jeans and a T-shirt underneath
another of his Canadian team sweaters, with the gold medal on a blue
ribbon around his neck, Kariya looked like a little boy who had
received every Christmas present he had ever wished for. He had a
little boy's wonder in his eyes, a little boy's delight in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   And it was as a little boy that Kariya first nurtured his Olympic
dream.</TE>
<TE>   He is not a large man, listed as 5-10 and 176 pounds but not
looking that tall or that heavy. Kariya was not a large child either,
and when the hockey experts filled with knowledge of the national
game watched young Kariya skate with grace and speed and measured him
with their eyes, they would tell him that he would not be big enough
for the NHL, but as an amateur, he could aim for the Olympics, with
the bigger ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always being told I was too small for the NHL but I'd be
perfect for the Olympics," Kariya said. "I believed in that and it
was always in my mind, that some day I could win a gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   Some day was a long time coming. Before he became a full-time
Mighty Duck, Kariya played for Canada in the 1994 Olympics. Kariya
led Canada with seven points in eight games but the silver medal that
Canada won was not celebrated. It was mourned. Only gold is good
enough.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, when NHL players made their Olympic debut, Kariya had
been named to the Canadian team. He suffered a season-ending
concussion on Feb. 1, though, and missed the Nagano experience. The
Canadians kind of missed that experience too, finishing fourth.</TE>
<TE>   A slap shot can't travel any faster than Kariya's 2002 Olympic
experience. It was 10 days of pressure, intense involvement with
nothing but Canada, Canadians, all things maple leaf. It was
practice, loss to Sweden, practice, worry, sleepless nights,
practice, games, and suddenly it was Sunday and the gold medals were
in a big box waiting for the players from the U.S. or from Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya scored a goal in the gold-medal game. He skated in a blur,
felt nothing because he was afraid to think or breathe or imagine the
moment when it arrived.</TE>
<TE>   It was the moment when Kariya and his teammates stood on a medals
podium with the heavy medal around their necks, eyes turned to the
Canadian flag, voices raised. "O Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya's eyes were wet with tears as the anthem played. "I
couldn't feel my legs," Kariya said, "or anything else. I was numb
all over. I can't explain it, except that I was numb. I couldn't feel
my body."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sunday night, Kariya hasn't let go of that medal. He went to
the Salt Lake City airport Monday with the medal in his hand. The
airport was a madhouse. People were waiting up to seven hours just to
check their baggage. When Kariya called the Ducks to say he might
miss his flight, Disney dispatched a private jet for the gold-medal
winner. It was not Kariya's choice, but this one time he accepted the
perk.</TE>
<TE>   "All of Canada stopped Sunday," Kariya said. "I heard there were
no cars on the streets of Toronto. Nobody in Newfoundland cares if I
win the Stanley Cup, but they care if I win the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya's grandfather, Alan Upton, is going to make a box for the
gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Into the box, with the medal, Kariya will have to store this
special joy, this amazing, incredible happiness.</TE>
<TE>   It's back to the Ducks now.</TE>

<HD>Sweep May Separate USC From the Pac</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brandon Granville sat out USC's practice Wednesday afternoon with
flu-like symptoms and, according to sometimes-hyperbolic USC Coach
Henry Bibby, a 104-degree temperature.</LD>
<LD>   Granville is expected to start tonight against No. 13 Oregon. But
what is less clear is whether it helped or hurt his condition to
consider the scenarios that face the Trojans this week if they have
hope of cutting down the Sports Arena nets as regular-season Pacific
10 Conference champions.</LD>
<LD>   Mathematically, it's simple. If No. 19 USC wins its final two
regular-season games--against first-place Oregon tonight and
eighth-place Oregon State on Saturday--the Trojans clinch at least a
share of their first Pac-10 championship since 1985, when they tied
with Washington.</LD>
<TE>   But it gets better for the Trojans, who are in a three-way tie for
second place at 11-5 with Arizona and California. USC has a realistic
shot at landing the No. 1 seeding in the resurrected Pac-10
tournament, which was last played in 1990 and has the top eight
finishers in the league playing at Staples Center March 7-9.</TE>
<TE>   But to claim the top seeding and play the eighth-place team in the
first round of the tournament, a few things must happen: First, USC
has to win its final two games and needs 12-4 Oregon to lose at UCLA
on Saturday. In addition, California must lose to either Arizona
State or Arizona. The Trojans have the tiebreaker against Arizona,
but Oregon and California have advantages over USC.</TE>
<TE>   USC senior power forward Sam Clancy said the Trojans have several
reasons to aim for the top seeding, which would give them a
first-round game against Washington or Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   "It would mean a lot [psychologically] and give us an easier road
through the tournament," Clancy said. "We wouldn't have to play
somebody so difficult who's already beat us once. It would mean a lot
for [seeding] in the NCAA tournament too."</TE>
<TE>   While the Trojans are ranked 19th by the writers and 20th by the
coaches, their ranking in the ratings percentage index, which is used
to help determine the 65-team NCAA tournament field and seedings, was
28th Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Of the six Pac-10 schools vying for invitations to the tournament,
the Trojans' RPI was fourth, behind No. 8 Arizona, No. 20 UCLA and
No. 24 California, but ahead of No. 38 Stanford and No. 40 Oregon,
according to collegerpi.com.</TE>
<TE>   The site also predicted the Trojans seeded No. 9 in the South
region, playing Syracuse in the first round with Duke waiting in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   There is a feeling, though, that if USC can win both games this
week and follow by winning the Pac-10 tournament, it could improve
its NCAA seeding to a No. 2 with a 24-7 record.</TE>
<TE>   Only once since 1988 has the Pac-10 regular-season or tournament
champion not been seeded at least No. 2. That occurred in 1996 when
defending national champion UCLA, seeded No. 4, lost in the first
round to Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   The point is moot, however, should USC lose tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are a decidedly different team on the road than in the
friendly confines of McArthur Court, where they equaled a school
record by going 16-0. Oregon is 3-6 on the road, 4-7 including
neutral-site games, while USC is 10-1 at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans gave the Ducks their biggest scare in Eugene, leading
with less than a minute to play before having a potential
game-winning three-point basket rim out with less than two seconds
remaining. Oregon made two free throws to close out a 73-69 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Although Granville is expected to start, Bibby probably is not
done tinkering with his starting lineup. With center Kostas Charissis
out because of a broken left ankle, Bibby started the
physical-but-untested Gregg Guenther in the post last week against
Stanford and California.</TE>
<TE>   But with run-and-gun Oregon averaging 87.7 points, third-best
nationally, Bibby probably will go small and athletic by starting
always-electric but often-erratic Desmon Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to bring it right away is kind of hard," Farmer said. "But
right now I think guys are more focused to bring it because
everybody's hungry for the championship."</TE>
<TE>   A No. 1 seeding in the Pac-10 tournament would satisfy the
appetite as well.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. No. 13 Oregon, 7:30 p.m.,</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KMPC (1540), KPLS (830).</TE>

<HD>Richardson Stands Tall After His Razorbacks Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nolan Richardson is still the coach at Arkansas, but he is speaking
like a man who may be on the verge of a career change.</LD>
<LD>   As a report of Richardson's possible departure circulated,
Mississippi State made a late spurt to defeat the Razorbacks, 89-83,
Wednesday night at Starkville, Miss.</LD>
<LD>   After the game, Richardson spoke calmly about his legacy in
Fayetteville, which includes a national championship in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   "So what can you take away from me?" Richardson asked. "I've won
everything there is to win. Name me coaches that can say that.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my players, 'Don't fret for me baby.' If I get to leave
the University of Arkansas, I graduated--and I did it my way."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Austin had 30 points for Mississippi State (22-7, 9-6
Southeastern Conference), which has won four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jannero Pargo matched his season-high with 35 points for the
Razorbacks (13-14, 5-10).</TE>
<TE>   There was a report before the game that Richardson and the
university would agree to a $3 million buyout of the remaining six
years of his $1.03 million-a-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   In 17 seasons with the Razorbacks, Richardson is 389-169.</TE>
<TE>   TOP 25</TE>
<TE>   Reece Gaines scored 26 points as Louisville earned its biggest

Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis Myles had 18 points and 12 rebounds for Louisville (16-11,
7-8 Conference USA).</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wonderful win for our players," Pitino said. "They put
in countless hours to get to a night like tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Bearcats (26-3, 13-2) had a six-game winning streak stopped
and blew a chance to secure their seventh consecutive regular-season
Conference USA title outright. They clinched at least a tie after No.
9 Marquette's loss Tuesday night at East Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you not come to play? I don't know. We were playing for
a conference championship and a seed in the NCAA tournament,"
Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins said.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Kansas 103, Kansas State 68--Kirk Hinrich had 24 points at
Lawrence, Kan., as the Jayhawks (26-2, 15-0 in the Big 12) scored
their most points ever against the Wildcats (11-15, 5-10).</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Maryland 96, Florida State 63--Juan Dixon scored 25 points
and the Terrapins (24-3, 14-1) clinched at least a share of the
Atlantic Coast Conference championship with a victory against the
Seminoles (11-15, 4-11) at Tallahassee, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Alabama 73, Auburn 68--Erwin Dudley had 25 points and 13
rebounds and the Crimson Tide (24-5, 12-3 in Southeastern Conference)
made eight consecutive free throws in the final minute to edge the
Tigers (12-14, 4-11) at Tuscaloosa, Ala. The victory enabled Alabama
to win the SEC title outright.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt 86, No. 11 Kentucky 73--Reserve Brendan Plavich scored
20 points as the Commodores (16-12, 6-9 in the SEC) ended an 18-game
losing streak to the Wildcats (19-8, 9-6) at Nashville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Georgia 82, South Carolina 75--Rashad Wright made a tying
three-point basket with 5.4 seconds left to get the Bulldogs (21-7,
10-5 in SEC) to overtime, then Steve Thomas scored six points to give
them a victory against the Gamecocks (16-12, 6-9) at Athens, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 90, No. 24 Wake Forest 77--B.J. Elder scored 23 of
his career-high 25 points in the second half and Tony Akins added 19
as the Yellow Jackets (14-15, 6-9 in ACC) upended the Demon Deacons
(18-11, 8-7) at Atlanta.</TE>

seeding in the Big Ten tournament.... David Dixon scored 14 points to

<LD>   UC Irvine (20-8, 13-4) at Long Beach State (12-16, 8-9), 5:30, Fox
Sports Net 2, KUCI-FM (88.9)--Irvine is guaranteed the No. 2 spot in
the Big West Conference tournament next week and can gain the No. 1
seeding if the Anteaters win and Utah State loses twice. Irvine has
won 20 games for the second consecutive season, the first time that
has happened in school history. Long Beach's 83-80 overtime victory
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo extended the 49ers' winning streak
to four games. Long Beach is in seventh place, but could potentially
finish in a five-way tie for fifth and end up seeded fourth.</LD>
<LD>   Idaho (9-16, 6-10) at Cal State Northridge (10-15, 9-7), 7--A
sub-.500 overall record notwithstanding, Northridge is in a three-way
tie with UC Santa Barbara and Pacific for third place in the Big West
Conference and, with two regular-season games to go, still has a shot
at a top-four seeding for next week's conference tournament. The
Matadors may have to earn it without their second-leading scorer and
best three-point shooter, guard Curtis Slaughter, who has a stress
fracture in his right leg. Northridge edged Idaho, 57-56, in the
teams' first meeting on Dec. 22.</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (4-21, 1-15) at UC Santa Barbara (15-10, 9-7),
7, KWRM (1370)--Fullerton is hoping to break a nine-game losing
streak against Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is in a third-place tie
with Cal State Northridge and Pacific. Branduinn Fullove is averaging
14.3 points a game for the Gauchos.</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside (8-16, 5-11) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (14-10,
8-8), 7, KPRO (1570)--Riverside is not eligible for the Big West
tournament this season, but the Highlanders could still impact the
seedings. Riverside defeated Cal Poly, 81-77, earlier this season.
Cal Poly lost to Long Beach on Saturday. The Mustangs are led by
forward Varnie Dennis, who averages 15 points a game.</TE>

<HD>Braswell Shove Is Alleged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A police report was filed Saturday night alleging that Cal State
Northridge men's basketball Coach Bobby Braswell shoved a Cal State
Fullerton student during halftime of the Matadors' 73-59 victory at
Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the Orange County District Attorney's office
said it has not received the report from the Fullerton university
police.</LD>
<LD>   In the report, Braswell is alleged to have pushed Kevin Jacks
while Jacks was being escorted out of the gymnasium by two officers.
Braswell acknowledged there was contact made between him and Jacks,
but that the student initiated the contact. The Northridge coach said
he was upset because Jacks threw a towel that hit him in the face as
he walked to the locker room.</LD>
<TE>   "There was some physical contact made with me," Braswell said
Wednesday. "I'm only going to take so much. I've been [coaching] long
enough to understand there's always going to be verbal abuse.</TE>
<TE>   " ... He yelled out, 'Hey, Coach,' and I turned my head and the
towel hit me right in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Jacks, a 20-year-old junior at Fullerton, admitted he had been
taunting Matador players as they came off the court. He said he threw
a towel in response to a player throwing the same towel at him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to hit him," Jacks said. "He got [angry].</TE>
<TE>   "When I was being taken out, he put his hands on me and pushed me
in the back."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell will coach in tonight's home game against Idaho.</TE>

<HD>Pac-10 Reprimands Toledo and Neuheisel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific 10 Conference reprimanded football coaches Bob Toledo of
UCLA and Rick Neuheisel of Washington on Wednesday for publicly
accusing each other of negative recruiting in the days before the
Feb. 6 signing date.</LD>
<LD>   Neuheisel said on a radio talk show that Toledo was trying to
steal players who had committed to Washington, and the UCLA coach
responded by saying Neuheisel told Bruin recruits that Toledo was on
his way out as coach.</LD>
<LD>   "This year's recruiting process seemed to raise emotions more than
usual," said Tom Hansen, the Pacific 10 Conference commissioner.
"Regardless of that, the conference has rules which require that
concerns about other Pac-10 institutions are to be communicated
internally, not publicly."</LD>
<TE>   The Pac-10, which also reprimanded Oregon for playing a video
during a home football game that showed Neuheisel in an unflattering
manner, plans to review rules regarding negative recruiting with
coaches in April.</TE>

<HD>York Needs Shoulder Surgery After Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defenseman Jason York said he will need arthroscopic surgery on his
right shoulder at the end of the season.</LD>
<LD>   York was scratched from Wednesday's game to rest, although he said
he could have played. He received a cortisone shot in the shoulder
Feb. 13 after the Ducks' last game before the Olympic break.</LD>
<LD>   "It had a negative effect," York said. "I couldn't lift my arm
last week. The doctor said that meant it wasn't inflammation and was
probably something in the joint. It will have to be taken care of
with surgery."</LD>
<TE>   York said that if he had the surgery now, the recovery would be
four to six weeks. The season has only seven weeks left, so he
decided to rest the shoulder and hopes to return to the lineup Sunday
when the Ducks play at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Niclas Havelid, a healthy scratch the last 12 games, started in
York's place Wednesday. Havelid had not played since Jan. 16.</TE>
<TE>   York, a free agent the Ducks signed to a three-year, $2-million
contract last summer, has been bothered by a sore shoulder much of
the season. He missed five games in January because of it.</TE>
<TE>   An offense-oriented defenseman, York has four goals and 19 points.
But his plus-minus is a minus-10.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hard all season because I am not able to do what I
normally can do," York said. "I can't take guys out because I don't
have full strength in the shoulder."</TE>

<HD>Ducks, Kariya Get Big Dose of Reality</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Forward, still enjoying gold-medal Olympic victory,
scores twice but Minnesota wins, 5-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was a return to the salt mine, not Salt Lake City, for Paul
Kariya.</LD>
<LD>   Olympic memories were officially filed away. Memories of poor
performances were dusted off in a 5-3 loss to Minnesota Wednesday
night at the Arrowhead Pond, as the Wild tested the Ducks' mettle
instead of being awed by their medals.</LD>
<LD>   So the Ducks' first post-Olympic game had a post-mortem feel to
it.</LD>
<TE>   In a morning news conference, Kariya put the finishing touches on
an Olympic masterpiece by Team Canada. He was ready to put it all in
the scrapbook and move on.</TE>
<TE>   "When you got the gold medal around your neck and you're listening
to the [Canadian] national anthem, it's almost like surreal," Kariya
said. "I couldn't feel my body, there was so much emotion and at the
same time numbness.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing left is the Stanley Cup. That is all there is in
my sights right now. That would finish it off."</TE>
<TE>   It took Canada a half century to win a gold medal. The Ducks have
that kind of pace going, as Wednesday's effort demonstrated. But
Kariya was back on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple days, I have been on the phone a lot, a lot of
congratulations, stuff like that," Kariya said. "After this [news
conference] is over today, it will be pretty easy to get back my
focus on the season."</TE>
<TE>   There was some Olympic magic left. Kariya had two goals and Oleg
Tverdovsky two assists, but their efforts were wasted. Jason
Marshall, Nick Schultz, Brad Bombardir and Matt Johnson scored goals,
as the Wild took a commanding lead then held off the Ducks in the
final 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Ducks welcomed home their three Olympians,
Kariya, who won the gold medal, Tverdovsky, who won the bronze with
Russia, and Ruslan Salei, who played for Belarus. They also welcomed
back center Steve Rucchin, who had missed 44 games with an injured
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing when you play for your team and you play for an
organization," Kariya said. "But it's another thing when you play for
everyone from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's back with the organization that has trouble keeping folk
from La Habra to San Clemente interested as the announced crowd of
10,022 in the more-than-half-empty Pond showed.</TE>
<TE>   But, then, there was little worth watching until the final 10
minutes. The Ducks didn't have a shot on goal in the game's first
seven minutes and went nearly 12 minutes without one in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks pressured the Wild after Samuel Pahlsson's goal cut the
Wild lead to 4-3 with nine minutes left. But they couldn't overcome
their early doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, a former Duck, fired in a blue-line shot, his first goal
against his former home, in the first period goal to put the Wild in
motion. By the time the game was over, the Ducks had been rolled over
by a team they hope to pass in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   "For the balance of the season, we'd like to play hard and well,
and I think we will," Coach Bryan Murray said. "We know our schedule
is such that we have to play well to be competitive in every game."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who had won seven of nine games before the Olympic
break, play 16 teams in their final 21 games and 13 have winning
records at the moment. Minnesota was one of the three sub-.500 teams.</TE>
<TE>   Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere couldn't handle a Marshall shot
that wasn't going to tax any speed gun. Goals by Schultz and
Bombardir--his first goal in 104 games with the Wild--put the Ducks
in a 3-0 hole 11 minutes into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks played the third period without Andy McDonald, who
suffered a head injury and was evaluated after the game.</TE>

<HD>German Can Already Taste It</HD>
<DH>Wrestling: San Fernando senior can become first from City
to place twice at state, but he's thinking about post-match feast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Will German has a chance to make history at the state wrestling
championships, but all he can think about is food.</LD>
<LD>   German, a senior from San Fernando High, was seventh in the state
last year at 171 pounds and could become the first City Section
wrestler to place twice at the state meet if he repeats his top-eight
performance this weekend at University of the Pacific in Stockton.</LD>
<LD>   He should have visions of trophies and medals dancing in his head,
but instead he dreams of cheeseburgers, pizza and French fries.</LD>
<TE>   German will wrestle again at 171 pounds, but his normal weight is
205. German cut weight for wrestling in part because it made his team
stronger and because he and Coach Mike Castillo thought he would have
a better shot of placing in the top eight at state.</TE>
<TE>   But whether he places or not, German plans to take no prisoners at
the local fast-food eateries after the match.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to eat everything I see," German said. "I'm gonna put
all of my weight back on."</TE>
<TE>   German said he ran three times a day, every day, for a month in
order to get his weight down, but only after some pressing by
Castillo. German played running back and linebacker during football
season and hopes to play football in college.</TE>
<TE>   "At first he had a problem with dropping weight because he wanted
to stay fat," Castillo joked. "He thinks he's a football player so he
wants to be fat."</TE>
<TE>   Fat doesn't cut it in wrestling, especially at the state meet,
where there are no chumps. But a little fatter might have meant a
less-bumpy road for German this year.</TE>
<TE>   German's first match will be against Anthony Rubalcava of Modesto
Davis, a wrestler who beat German in a freestyle tournament last
summer. In turn, German has beaten Kirk Davis of Arroyo Grande, the
top-ranked 189-pound wrestler, three times.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought 171 would be the optimum weight for him to wrestle at,"
Castillo said. "He's big for a 171-pounder and he has the advantage
because he'll be on his feet more. At 189, it's a lot more on the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Only time will tell if they made the right decision. German said
he isn't thinking about making history. He dominated the City Section
finals with pins in all three of his matches and became the third
wrestler to win four consecutive City titles.</TE>
<TE>   He just hopes to stay on the same roll when he arrives in
Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure," German said. "I'm just trying to stay
focused. My plan is to just wrestle smart, that's all. I'm not really
working on any moves, I'm just going to take whatever I see."</TE>
<TE>   German went 30-3 this season, including a victory in the North
Torrance tournament and a second place at the Leemore Bash, when he
wrestled at 189 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   And even though this chance to make history should be an exciting
time for German, he said he can't wait until it's over.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I won't have to make weight anymore," German said. "It's not
that it's too tough, it's just that I like to eat."</TE>

<HD>Santa Anita's Big 'Cap Turns Into Big Mystery</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Field of 14--largest since 1983--won't have
to contend with Mizzen Mast in 65th running.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a week ago, the winner of the Santa Anita Handicap almost
looked like a foregone conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   Mizzen Mast, who already had two graded stakes victories at the
meet--including the Strub Stakes on Feb. 2--would have been a solid
favorite Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the 4-year-old son of Cozzene, arguably the country's
best horse, sidelined because of a foot injury, the 65th Santa Anita
Handicap has become one of the most wide open in the storied history
of the race.</LD>
<TE>   The size of the field alone suggests there are no standouts or
thoroughbreds scaring anybody away. In fact, none of the anticipated
participants has ever won a Grade I.</TE>
<TE>   When post positions were drawn Wednesday morning, 14 were entered
in the Big 'Cap, the largest field for the $1-million event since 17
participated in 1983. On that day, Bates Motel and jockey Terry
Lipham dominated, winning by 21/2 lengths before an on-track crowd of
66,007.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the absence of Mizzen Mast, trainer Bobby Frankel could be
in a position to win his first Santa Anita Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Tufts, the track's longtime morning line maker, believes the
hall of famer will be saddling the favorite Saturday. He established
the Frankel-trained and Frank Stronach-owned entry of Euchre and
Milwaukee Brew the 7-2 choice.</TE>
<TE>   If the entry does indeed start as the favorite at those odds, it
will be the highest-priced public choice since Lightning Mandate was
also 7-2 in 1976. He finished third under jockey Angel Cordero Jr.,
beaten by Royal Glint and Ancient Title.</TE>
<TE>   Euchre is the better half of the duo.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-year-old gelded son of Personal Flag, he has won six of 19 and
has not been worse than second in his last five appearances. Since
returning after five months on the shelf, he has been second in three
consecutive stakes races.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 9 at Hollywood Park, he was second in the Native Diver
Handicap, then was beaten by a head by Wooden Phone in the San
Pasqual, then chased Redattore home in the San Antonio Handicap on
Super Bowl Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The 11/4 miles will be right up his alley," said Garrett Gomez,
Euchre's regular rider. "Every race leading up to this one he's been
improving. He's doing very well. It looks like there will be plenty
of pace in the race, so we'll just fall away from there and see what
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Kent Desormeaux, who is Mizzen Mast's regular jockey, has taken
the mount on Milwaukee Brew.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-year-old Wild Again horse, he was fifth at 5-2 in the Whirlway
Handicap on Feb. 10 at the New Orleans Fair Grounds in his first race
for Frankel. He is a winner of four of 14 lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-2 second choice on Tufts' line is Futural, who did have a
Grade I in his grasp last summer at Hollywood Park. However, after
crossing the wire first in the Hollywood Gold Cup, he was
disqualified on a controversial call and placed second behind the
Frankel-trained Aptitude.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the 6-year-old Future Storm gelding is winless in
three starts. He finished second in the San Diego behind Del Mar
specialist Skimming, then went to the sidelines after finishing last,
beaten by 221/2 lengths, in the Pacific Classic.</TE>
<TE>   In his first race after a layoff, Futural, who is trained by Craig
Dollase for a partnership, was third, beaten by 51/2 lengths going a
flat mile. The Big 'Cap distance will suit him better and he has won
four times in Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   Like Frankel, Richard Mandella will be saddling two Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of the race with Siphon in 1997 and Malek in 1998,
Mandella will send out Cagney, an 8-1 longshot, and 15-1 outsider
Kudos.</TE>
<TE>   With Cagney, the trainer has no concerns about the distance. The
Brazilian-bred son of Roy will run all day; his biggest victory in
this country came in the Carleton F. Burke Handicap at 11/2 miles
last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The question is the main track. Cagney hasn't run on dirt since he
finished sixth of seven in his Brazilian debut on Feb. 20, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He also has the first post position, which has seldom led to
success in the Big 'Cap. Since the first Santa Anita Handicap in
1935, only two horses have won from that spot. One was Mr. Right, who
beat 14 rivals in 1968. The other was the aforementioned Malek, who
had to beat only three horses in a forgettable renewal four years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He's trained extremely well the last couple of works," said
Cagney's rider, Mike Smith. "If he runs like he's been training,
he'll be very tough to beat. He's a tough, old horse so the dirt
kicked back at him shouldn't bother him. He's been a lot more
aggressive in his works."</TE>
<TE>   The overflow field will have 12 betting interests. Besides Euchre
and Milwaukee Brew, coupled as the mutuel field are Dig For It, who
managed to run third in last year's Pacific Classic, and Last Parade.</TE>

<LD>One way or another, a streak will continue after today's seventh at
Aqueduct is official.</LD>
<LD>   Arromanches, a 9-year-old gray son of Relaunch, will be trying for
his 11th consecutive win and the 29th of his 70-race career.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, his trainer, Arthur Wendel, who claimed
Arromanches for $50,000 out of his victory Feb. 2, will be trying to
win his first race since May 2000. Since then, he has sent out 97
consecutive losers.</LD>
<TE>   A Virginia-bred, Arromanches, who will be carrying a $65,000
claiming price today, has not lost since finishing fifth as an 8-1
shot on May 6 at Philadelphia Park.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has rattled off five wins at Monmouth Park in New
Jersey, continued his streak with a pair of wins at Belmont Park and
has won three times since the New York circuit moved to Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Now owned by Bruce Golden, Arromanches did get some help to keep
his streak going. He was second under the wire, beaten 41/4 lengths
by Trounce on Dec. 29, but the winner was disqualified for
interference in the stretch and he was moved up.</TE>
<TE>   The five horses scheduled to challenge Arromanches have combined
for 34 victories, topped by Esteemed Friend with 14.</TE>
<TE>   Case Dismissed, who has won six times, Tio Cavito (seven), Love
Happy (four) and Royal Ruby (three victories) round out the lineup in
the six-furlong sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The third at Santa Anita isn't much in terms of
quality--3-year-old fillies running for a $25,000 claiming price--but
the first leg of a pick six that has a carryover of $123,304.97 drew
a dozen runners and a case can be made for more than half of them.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Truly A Judge. The gelding will be trying for his fifth
win in his last six starts in today's second at Santa Anita. He has
won three of four since being claimed for $20,000 by trainer Dave
Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Double Dollar Day. The gelding, a participant in
today's eighth at Golden Gate Fields, is only one for 23 lifetime and
is winless in 11 starts since the beginning of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Ice Fella in the sixth,
using Devil's Horn, Painted Avenue, Re Echo, Mr. Reed and Cash B.
Fast in the seventh and Tianna Road and Temagami in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 2/131. Money: Previous Day/Meet

<HD>Surgery Sidelines Jordan</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Wizard star expected to miss two to six
weeks after torn cartilage is found in right knee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan will probably be able to play again this season.
Whether he can make it back in time to save the Washington Wizards'
drive for the playoffs is another matter.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan had surgery for the first time in his career Wednesday
morning. Team physician Dr. Stephen Haas found torn cartilage and
debris in the 39-year-old forward's right knee, an injury Haas said
was the result of normal wear and tear for an athlete of Jordan's
caliber.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, recovery time for such an operation is two to six
weeks, and many variables--age, severity of the tear, workout
ethic--can determine where a patient fits in that range.</LD>
<TE>   The Wizards will have a better idea of Jordan's time frame when he
begins therapy after a few days of rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you have a knee where you're getting swelling, you hope
that when they go in there they find something they can fix," Coach
Doug Collins said. "When I talked to Michael, he was happy they found
the source of the problem and that they were able to fix it."</TE>
<TE>   If Jordan's falls in the middle of the range--four weeks--he would
miss 16 games, including the entire six-game trip in mid-March that
could make or break the Wizards' season.</TE>
<TE>   He could join the trip in progress if he misses two or three
weeks, but a six-week layoff wouldn't bring him back until the final
week of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Collins cautioned that Jordan might have to choose between playing
this season or next.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of miles on those legs, and Michael didn't play
them at a low level," Collins said. "Michael played at the highest of
levels. Michael at 23, he's going to heal faster than he does at 39.
He knows that if he has visions of playing next year, then it would
do no good to rush back and try to do something to set himself back.
We've got to all be patient."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, averaging 24 points, was put on the injured list Tuesday,
which requires him to miss a minimum of five games, including
Wednesday's loss to the Portland Trail Blazers and two games against
his former team, the Chicago Bulls.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>According to King General Manager Dave Taylor, the results of Coach
Andy Murray's recent MRI exam were good. Murray, who is suffering
from post-concussion syndrome after a car accident, did not show any
bleeding on the brain.</LD>
<LD>   Murray's return, however, is uncertain, which remains a concern to
his players.</LD>
<LD>   "For me personally, hockey has become secondary," King captain
Mattias Norstrom said before the Kings' 5-4 victory over Pittsburgh
on Wednesday. "What happens with us is secondary to his health. There
are more important things in life than hockey and that is your health
and your family. It's important."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If interim Coach Dave Tippett seems at ease in his new role while
Murray recovers, it's because he's been a successful head coach
before. Tippett compiled a 165-85 record with Houston in the
International Hockey League and led the Aeros to the Turner Cup
championship in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "If I hadn't been a coach and been in some tough situations
before, I would be thinking a lot more about it," Tippett said. "I
guess that's why I feel very comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Jan. 30, played for the first time with the Kings.</TE>

<HD>Vanbiesbrouck Is Sharp in Defeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Vanbiesbrouck's return from retirement was everything the New
Jersey Devils hoped for, except for the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia's Simon Gagne spoiled Vanbiesbrouck's return to the
net with a second-period goal that carried the Eastern
Conference-leading Flyers past the Devils, 1-0, Wednesday night at
East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "I never questioned myself," said Vanbiesbrouck, 38, said after
making 31 saves in his first game since April. "If I questioned
myself, I never would have done this. I was confident."</LD>
<TE>   Roman Cechmanek made 22 saves in helping the Flyers remain
unbeaten (3-0-1) against the Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of our players was on top of his game tonight," Flyer
Coach Bill Barber said. "It was like getting an A+ on an exam."</TE>
<TE>   Vanbiesbrouck, who gave Martin Brodeur a rare night off, had two
key stops during an early 51-second, two-man power play and also
stopped a close-range shot by Mark Recchi after the Devils got a man
back.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who had a goal and three assists in six games for Canada at
the Salt Lake City Olympics, beat Vanbiesbrouck at 7:59 of the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't know how he slipped it in there," Vanbiesbrouck
said. "It hit my stick, the inside of my pad. I felt all of that and
when you feel that stuff, you go 'Oh, geez.'"</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Florida 2--Brett Hull's persistence eventually paid
off.</TE>
<TE>   With 48.5 seconds left in overtime, Hull's short-range slap shot
rallied the Red Wings at Sunrise, Fla., and foiled a franchise-record
performance by Panther goalie Roberto Luongo, who stopped 57 of 60
shots.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only one that was going to go in for me tonight," said
Hull, who scored on his 10th shot. "It's frustrating to have all of
those chances, but you can't let it show."</TE>
<TE>   Luongo let his frustrations show by lying face down on the ice a
few seconds after Hull lifted Detroit to its fifth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you going to do?" Luongo said. "It's a learning process.
One day it will pay off."</TE>
<TE>   Luc Robitaille's second power-play goal of the game forced
overtime with 2:13 left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Florida, which blew a two-goal lead, picked up a point but lost
its fifth in a row. The Panthers have won only once in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Florida has not defeated Detroit in nine games, dating to Dec. 1,
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Chicago 2--Stephane Quintal and Jeff Hackett made life
difficult for their former team.</TE>
<TE>   Quintal scored a power-play goal with 4:32 left to lift the
Canadiens at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Hackett, another former Blackhawk, stopped 27 shots to post his
first victory since Oct. 13 and help the Canadiens end a three-game
skid.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't taking any personal vendettas against anybody," said
Hackett, who made his first start since Jan. 21. "I was just trying
to concentrate on being successful."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if the victory was special because of the opponent,
Hackett said: "I don't know about that. It's been so long since I
played. It's been such a tough [season]."</TE>
<TE>   Hackett, who played five-plus seasons with the Blackhawks, sat out
20 games this season because of a dislocated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hackett, Quintal was more concerned about a victory than the
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always fun to score. I don't care who it's against," said
Quintal, who played for Chicago last season. "It was a big goal that
got us two points."</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>Oregon's Jones Is on a High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can be hard to make a name for yourself when your name is Freddie
Jones.</LD>
<LD>   But he'll be playing L.A. for the next two weeks, and a few more
people are going to catch his high-flying act as Oregon takes its
shot at a Pacific 10 Conference title.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just the Freddie Show, either.</LD>
<TE>   Combined with the "Two Lukes"--point guard Luke Ridnour and
swingman Luke Jackson--Jones gives Oregon one of the most underrated
backcourts in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Their three perimeter players probably are as skilled and gifted
as any in the West," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "I know in the East
you have Duke and Maryland, even Kansas. But in the West, I think
those three players are as skilled and talented as any."</TE>
<TE>   It already has been a breakthrough season for the Ducks, whose No.
13 ranking is their highest since 1975, when Coach Ernie Kent was an
Oregon sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Win one of two against USC tonight and UCLA Saturday, and Oregon
can clinch a share of its first conference championship in an
astonishing 57 years--though it's far from automatic for a team that
was unbeaten at home and only 3-4 on the Pac-10 road.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will be back next week, competing in what could be a
wild Pac-10 tournament beginning Thursday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Until this season, if Jones was known at all outside of Oregon, it
was for his dunking ability. He's only 6 feet 4, but his athleticism
is reminiscent of former Trojan Jeff Trepagnier.</TE>
<TE>   What Jones has developed in his senior season is what he always
lacked: consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, he would follow a 22-point game with a seven-point
outing, or a 36-point performance with a four-point night.</TE>
<TE>   But since a Dec. 2 upset loss to Portland, Jones has scored in
double figures in 21 consecutive games. In his last seven, he has
averaged 25 points and seven rebounds. (USC held him to his lowest
output in that stretch, with 14.)</TE>
<TE>   "I knew coming in this year people wanted to see me be more
consistent, day-in and day-out," Jones said. "A lot of it is
conditioning. This year I've been in better shape than in the past. I
didn't want to leave my career here on a sour note."</TE>
<TE>   He is fifth in the league in scoring at 18.6 points a game, and is
shooting almost 54%--a 7% improvement over last season, and
particularly impressive for a guard who has taken more than 300
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Kent credits Ridnour--the superb floor leader and three-point
shooter whose stamina faded down the stretch as a freshman last
season--with helping set the tone for a rigorous off-season, and
Jones agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty much a collective effort, but Luke Ridnour, he's
our point guard and probably hardest worker. He took it upon himself
to just lead us with his work ethic," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also got some pointers from Michael Jordan working at his
basketball camp in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "He played with us every day. Just during games a little bit, he
would give me a little advice," Jones said. "He told me to keep
attacking, and work on my mid-range shot."</TE>
<TE>   The mid-range shot can help Jones make it in the NBA, but it's his
dunks that make a crowd go nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "It just comes naturally to me," he said. "I let my teammates do
the rating. I'll just tell you the ones people say: There was an
alley-oop last year against Illinois Chicago--Luke [Ridnour] threw it
to me behind me, and I had to extend fully and catch it to dunk it.</TE>
<TE>   "And probably the Arizona State dunk this year. [Jones went up and
over 6-3 Kenny Crandall as Crandall tried to take a charge.]</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, my favorite thing is the athletic layup," Jones said.
"My freshman year against UCLA at home, I had a reverse layup that
pretty much got the crowd out of their seats. I think it was [Dan]
Gadzuric who came over, and I'd already left the floor and I had to
go up and under and switch to my left hand on a reverse."</TE>
<TE>   Cue the highlight reel, because Jones' time in an Oregon uniform
is winding down.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole career went by so fast. It feels like I just got here,"
he said. "But it's coming to a good end. To be in position to play
for a Pac-10 championship ... I just hope I get a taste of it."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's Lament</TE>
<TE>   Nolan Richardson's tirade about criticism, media coverage and
racism this week wasn't completely unfamiliar to most people who have
been around the Arkansas coach.</TE>
<TE>   It might help to understand Richardson remembers a time in Texas
when he couldn't go to the movies in El Paso because he is African
American.</TE>
<TE>   In college, he was the only black player on Texas Western's
team--a few years before the school made history with the first
all-black starting five to win the NCAA championship in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   When Richardson played, he was left home for a trip to Louisiana
because Centenary didn't allow African Americans in its gym.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting against racism and overcoming disadvantages are as much a
part of who Richardson is as pressure defense. He has complained
vocally in the past about the unfairness of standardized tests toward
minorities and about white teams being portrayed as intelligent and
black teams as athletic.</TE>
<TE>   The point is, he is often right, but he is always fighting: It's a
lifelong habit.</TE>
<TE>   Long after his 1994 NCAA championship team had the respect of the
country, Richardson was still preaching about respect.</TE>
<TE>   How he is treated in comparison to other coaches at Arkansas and
by a press corps he pointed out did not include any black journalists
is difficult to assess from afar.</TE>
<TE>   But he's right about this: He has earned the right to have a
sub-par season (Arkansas is 13-14). He has taken Arkansas to three
Final Fours and won an NCAA championship, and only six active coaches
have appeared in the tournament more than Richardson's 16 trips with
Arkansas and Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   "Nolan's a very respected man and one who says what's on his
mind," Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith told reporters. "He's been a
trailblazer in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I'm close to Coach Richardson. He's my mentor and has been
for a number of years.... Being black and being in a place where they
expect you to win every game, I probably understand his frustration
better than anybody. If you don't win every game, there has to be a
reason.... You have to have a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas Chancellor John White said Wednesday night he plans to
meet with Richardson over his recent remarks.</TE>
<TE>   The Shark's Long Season</TE>
<TE>   It has been a disappointing season for Fresno State, where Jerry
Tarkanian's team was in the top 25 early in the season but has lost
six of nine to fall to 17-12 with two regular-season games left.</TE>
<TE>   In a season marked by eligibility questions at different times
about leading scorer Melvin Ely and guard Chris Sandy, guard Chris
Jefferies' knee surgery was probably the biggest blow.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is mild suspense about whether Fresno can do anything
in the Western Athletic Conference tournament, the bigger question is
whether Tarkanian--noncommittal so far--will continue coaching.</TE>
<TE>   It can't be much fun right now. In 30 seasons as a Division I
coach, Tarkanian has failed to win 20 games only once, in a 16-12
season at Nevada Las Vegas in 1981. This team is cutting it close.</TE>
<TE>   "They say you learn through adversity," Tarkanian, 71, told the
Fresno Bee after losing to Louisiana Tech on a buzzer-beater last
week. "God, we've learned a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Packing Their Bags</TE>
<TE>   Let the bubble talk wait a week. The so-called small conferences
are beginning their tournaments, and by Tuesday night, a dozen teams
will have won NCAA tournament berths.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic Sun, Big South, Colonial, Horizon, Metro Atlantic
Athletic, Mid-Continent, Missouri Valley, Northeast, Ohio Valley,
Southern, Sun Belt and West Coast conferences will be complete by
early next week.</TE>

<LD>Nibardo Martinez scored two goals, including the game-winner two
minutes into injury time, and the Roosevelt High boys' soccer team
advanced to the City Section finals for the second time in three
years with a 3-2 victory over Eastern League rival South Gate on
Wednesday afternoon at South Gate.</LD>
<LD>   Roosevelt, which beat Gardena, 2-1, in the 2000 championship game
at East L.A. College, will play top-seeded Woodland Hills El Camino
Real at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at UCLA's Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Rene Chicas tied the score, 2-2, in the 80th minute off a pass
from Ram teammate Javier Maravilla, but 15th-seeded Roosevelt
(19-5-3) controlled the ensuing kickoff and Chris Alvarez sent a high
ball bouncing into South Gate's penalty area, where Martinez flipped
it over goalie Armando Navarro. Roosevelt avenged 4-1 and 5-2 losses
in league play.</LD>
<TE>   "When they scored, we were thinking about just maintaining the
score and regrouping in overtime," said Martinez, who has nine goals
and 11 assists this season.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we got the ball in their end, Chris gave it to me and it
was a race between me and the goalie. Fortunately, I got there
first."</TE>
<TE>   Hector Islas gave the Roughriders their first lead, 2-1, when he
redirected a pass from Alvarez into the upper right corner in the
67th minute for his 15th goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was fouled in the 18-yard box and converted the ensuing
penalty kick to tie the score, 1-1, in the 60th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto Navarro was tripped in the penalty area and Maravilla's

<TE>   In a girls' Championship Division semifinal:</TE>
<TE>   El Camino Real 1, Granada Hills 1 (El Camino Real wins on penalty

<DL></DL>
<LD>The top-seeded San Pedro High girls' soccer team advanced to the City
Championship final after scoring three goals in overtime for a 6-3
victory over visiting Chatsworth on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth (15-10-0), which had appeared in the last seven title
games and 12 of the 13 since City girls' soccer playoffs began in
1989, made a late bid for another final berth when Casey Dodd tied
the score at 3-3 with a goal off a 35-yard free kick by Jenna Fodor
with 30 seconds to go in regulation.</LD>
<LD>   But San Pedro senior forward Jennifer Ramos converted what turned
out to be the winning goal at the 85-minute mark in the first half of
overtime.</LD>
<TE>   The Pirates (21-3-2) also knocked out Chatsworth in the semifinals
the other time the Chancellors failed to make the final (1994). It
also avenged a loss in last season's semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   It was Ramos' third goal of the game and ninth of the season after
she missed half of Marine League play and all of the last two seasons
because of two surgeries on her right knee.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates will face El Camino Real in the final at 1:15 p.m.
Saturday at UCLA.</TE>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Soccer took a significant step toward broadening the audience
for its national team games Wednesday when it announced a new
five-year television agreement with Telemundo.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of the partnership, the Spanish-language
network--currently being purchased by NBC--will broadcast 10 U.S.
games each year, including two U.S. women's national team matches,
through the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Telemundo "reaches 88% of the country's Hispanic population [of 35
million]," Jorge Hidalgo, the network's senior vice president for
sports, said Wednesday in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Soccer believes adding that potential audience to the one it
already has on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 will help soccer in the U.S. grow
faster.</TE>
<TE>   "Telemundo brings added passion and emotion to our sport," said
Dan Flynn, U.S. Soccer's secretary general, a tacit admission that
the English-language telecasts frequently fail to deliver that
element.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Spanish-language network features not only vastly
experienced soccer cameramen and directors but also the nation's top
two soccer commentators, play-by-play announcer Andres Cantor and
analyst Norberto Longo.</TE>
<TE>   The pair will handle the U.S. games--both men's and women's--just
as they do now for Mexico's national team. Telemundo also has a
long-term agreement with the Mexican soccer federation to broadcast
its games in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that we are the eyes and ears of the Hispanic viewers in
the United States," Hidalgo said. "We pay close attention to those
viewers and try to respect their wishes [regarding] what they want to
see when they want to see it, and basically respect the sport of
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sport of passion, and unless you have the passion, you
can't understand the passion."</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo has carried some U.S. games for the past couple of
years, but it was last year's World Cup qualifier between the U.S.
and Mexico in Columbus, Ohio, that led both sides to expand the
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "We walked away from that match just thrilled not only with the
result [a 2-0 U.S. victory] but with the audience on the
English-language broadcast on ESPN," said Brad Hunt, a senior vice
president for IMG, which negotiated the agreement. "About a week
later, Jorge [Hidalgo] said the Telemundo audience had been twice the
size.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point the lightbulb became very bright, that we should be
finding a way to incorporate this [Telemundo] audience into the U.S.
Soccer sponsorship audience. That's what this contract is meant to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo will broadcast the U.S.-Honduras men's game live from
Seattle on Saturday at 1 p.m., as well as seven more U.S. games
leading up to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   One day after groundbreaking ceremonies for a 27,000-seat stadium
in Carson for the Galaxy, Major League Soccer was dealt an unexpected
blow when the city of McKinney, Texas, unexpectedly reversed its
decision to build a similar soccer-specific stadium that would have
served as home to the Dallas Burn.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, the McKinney city council voted, 7-0, to approve
construction of a 22,000-seat stadium, but on Wednesday city
officials told MLS they had "elected to cease all negotiations on the
project."</TE>
<TE>   Don Garber, the MLS commissioner, promised to continue the search
for a new stadium for the Burn, which now plays at the Cotton Bowl in
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in MLS, the Galaxy announced that it will play Cruz Azul
of Mexico at 7:30 p.m. on March 12 at Titan Stadium on the Cal State
Fullerton campus.</TE>

<HD>Owen Drives Loara Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With one swing of her bat, Alicia Owen of Anaheim Loara knocked
top-seeded Santa Ana Foothill out of the Southern Section softball
playoffs last season.</LD>
<LD>   Owen did so by hitting a pitch over the head of the center fielder
in the ninth inning for a two-run double and a 2-1 victory in the
Division II quarterfinals.</LD>
<LD>   Owen, now a senior, delivered a lot of knockout punches last
season.</LD>
<TE>   In all of Loara's seven Empire League and three section playoff
victories, Owen drove in the run that put the Saxons ahead for good.
The master of the game-winning RBI, she is part of a 1-2 punch that
makes Loara one of the more formidable Southland teams in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   With Stanford-bound senior Lauren Lappin batting third and teams
understandably cautious about pitching to her--she batted .440 as a
freshman--Owen emerged last season as one of the finest clutch
players in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you say," said Scott Weber, the Loara coach whose team
had never won a playoff game before last season. "Alicia came through
every time she had a chance. Whenever we needed a hit, she got it."</TE>
<TE>   Batting behind Lappin for the first time in her career, Owen drove
in 44 runs last season, batted .427, and hit eight home runs to help
Loara finish 23-10. Owen has 93 runs batted in in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "She saved our butts in so many games," said Lappin, who batted
.417 last season, hit four homers, drew 27 walks and scored 36 runs.
"They have to pitch to one of us. If runners are on base, Alicia is
likely hitting them in. She's a great clutch hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Owen's focus in crunch time may be due in part to personal
adversity she faced and her team shared. Owen's father, Skip,
suffered a heart attack and died nine days before the beginning of
her sophomore season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become a more calm person, I let things go easier, I try to
have fun," Owen said. "I don't take things as personal and changed
emotionally. A lot of people said I've matured faster. I became more
serious, and maybe I've become more serious about the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely made me a better player. I was trying to get a
college scholarship. I know that's what my dad wanted. I had to
knuckle down and get done what I had to do."</TE>
<TE>   Owen said the day she signed with Louisiana State was the proudest
day of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Owen, who will play second base in college, will be the backup
pitcher to Katie Joosten this season. Lappin plays shortstop, but was
recruited by Stanford as a catcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Having faced them a lot over the last three years, I hold my
breath every single time one of them is up," Fullerton Rosary Coach
Tom Tice says of the Owen-Lappin duo. "Trying to get them out is
always the biggest challenge, not just for that game, but sometimes
for the whole week or the whole season. They are two of the toughest
outs, back-to-back, that we've faced. It's a white-knuckle ride every
time."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Success Could Be Set in Motion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recent UCLA opponents have gotten queasy from the motion created by
the Bruins' relatively new four-out, one-in offense.</LD>
<LD>   The motion attack keyed victories over USC, Arizona and Stanford
and will be used extensively the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The primary differences from the new offense and structured 1-4
alignment the Bruins used most of the season are the dearth of set
plays and the room in the paint for center Dan Gadzuric to operate.</LD>
<TE>   "The motion has a two-guard front, it distorts the defense and
gets us good spacing," Coach Steve Lavin said. "It's like a series of
broken plays in football and it creates problems for opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "Some coaches aren't comfortable with it because it gives players
too much freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin has grown to like it because he trusts the veterans to make
sound decisions and the four freshmen are free to play without
thinking too much.</TE>
<TE>   Also, nearly any combination of players can be used because only
the center has a singular role.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest concern with a motion offense is too many turnovers
from the lack of structure, but the Bruins have had about the same
number regardless of the offense they employ.</TE>
<TE>   If a shot isn't taken in the first 25 seconds or so, the motion
gives way to set plays.</TE>
<TE>   "The value of having both in your arsenal is you can adjust to
different matchups," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As he did last season, Gadzuric has gained late-season momentum.
The 6-foot-11 senior is averaging 14.7 points and 9.3 rebounds over
the last seven games and has scored in double figures in 11 of the
last 13.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with an upset of Kansas on Jan. 12, his only poor
performances came at Villanova and at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan is playing as well as any post presence in the country,"
Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric's shot-blocking has improved--he had three at California
and three more at Stanford last week--and he is staying out of foul
trouble, playing at least 32 minutes in seven of the last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Late last season he went on a similar tear, scoring in double
figures and grabbing at least eight rebounds in eight of the last
nine games.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Oregon State, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   Site--Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150, 850).</TE>
<TE>   Records--UCLA 18-9, 10-6, Oregon State 12-15, 4-12.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Beaver senior guard Brandon Payton, half brother of NBA
guard Gary Payton, is averaging 20.3 points over the last three
games, shooting 23 for 39 (.590) from the field, nine for 16 (.563)
from three-point range. Payton replaced Jimmie Haywood, who quit, in
the starting lineup. Forward Brian Jackson, the team's second-leading
scorer and rebounder, also quit last week but returned. Coach Ritchie
McKay said Jackson will start against UCLA. Forward Philip Ricci is
the team's leading scorer at 16.2 and rebounder at 6.8. Oregon
State's point total of 91 in a victory over Washington State on
Saturday was the first time the Beavers reached 90 in a Pacific 10
Conference game since 1995.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA's softball team has appeared in three consecutive NCAA
championship games, and the Bruins, with a 17-1 start, are ranked No.
1 this year.</LD>
<LD>   They won their first 16 games before Long Beach State ended the
streak in the first game of a nonconference doubleheader Saturday.
The most impressive victories were 7-0 over No. 4-ranked Louisiana
State, and 6-1 and 11-2 over No. 12 Nebraska.</LD>
<LD>   Pitchers Amanda Freed and Keira Goerl have dominated, and the
Bruins are averaging 8.6 runs, batting .415 and have 21 home runs.
Senior Stacey Nuveman is batting .592 (29 for 49) with seven home
runs and 29 runs batted in. She has 77 homers in her career, eight
shy of the NCAA record held by Laura Espinoza and Leah Braatz, both
of Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   Junior shortstop Natasha Watley is batting .567 and Freed, left
fielder Erin Rahn and designated hitter Claire Sua each are batting
over .400. Tairia Mims' .393 average and four home runs in the
cleanup spot are allowing No. 3 hitter Nuveman to see better pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there's the bottom three in our lineup, who have been real
productive," Coach Sue Enquist said. "They've put our top three in
the lineup in position to drive in RBIs."</TE>
<TE>   Freed, a senior, has a 7-1 record and a 0.59 earned-run average.
Goerl, a sophomore, is 9-0 with two no-hitters and a 0.26 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Goerl, a two-time Southern Section player of the year while at
Moreno Valley Valley View High, has given up only 20 hits in 54
innings and has 83 strikeouts. "She came into this program with a
huge amount of success in high school and sometimes with a player
like that, there's a tendency to be resistant to change," Enquist
said. "But she has had a go-for-it attitude ever since she got here
and because of that, the game has paid her back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Penn State pole vaulter Kevin Dare died from head injuries he
suffered when he landed awkwardly in the pit area Saturday in the Big
Ten indoor championships at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The accident has Art Venegas, coach of UCLA's men's track and
field team, calling for the use of protective helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize that it's that dangerous," Venegas said. "If
you stand next to the bar and see someone vault 16 or 17 feet, you
realize how high they are. It's an unfortunate risk, but there is a
risk in every event out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Count San Diego Coach Brad Holland among the many who believe the
Pepperdine men's basketball team, 20-7 and co-champion of the West
Coast Conference regular season, should be NCAA bound even if it
doesn't win the West Coast Conference tournament, which begins
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They're an NCAA team if I've ever seen one," said Holland after
the Toreros' 90-79 loss to the Waves on Friday at Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior forwards Jimmy Miggins and Boomer Brazzle of Pepperdine
were selected first-team All-WCC in basketball. Wave guard Terrance
Johnson was the conference's freshman of the year and senior center
Cedric Suitt won the defensive player-of-the-year award. Gonzaga's
Dan Dickau was the conference player of the year and Mark Few was
chosen coach of the year for the second consecutive season.... Cal
State Northridge center Ryan Sims has been suspended indefinitely for
"conduct detrimental to the team." The Matadors also probably will be
without guard Curtis Slaughter, their second-leading scorer, for
tonight's home game against Idaho. He has a stress fracture in his
right leg.... Ardeshir Asgari has resigned as Cal State Fullerton's
wrestling coach effective at the end of March. Asgari, 44, who has
coached the Titans for 10 seasons, said he is moving to Nicaragua
with his wife.</TE>

<LD>Stacey Dales scored 14 of her 17 points in the second half, leading
fifth-ranked Oklahoma to a 75-56 victory over No. 15 Texas Tech in
the regular-season finale Wednesday night at Norman, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   The Sooners (24-3, 14-2 Big 12), winners of their third
consecutive regular-season title, held Tech to a season-low 31%
shooting and beat the Raiders for the fourth consecutive time.
LaNeishea Caufield added 18 points for Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   Natalie Ritchie led Tech (17-10, 8-8) with 18 points. Leading
scorer Jia Perkins scored only eight, half her average, on four-of-19
shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Dales, only one of four from the field with four turnovers in the
first half, started the second half by scoring inside and then making
a three-point shot to give the Sooners a 38-25 lead. She added a
three-point play later as Oklahoma pushed the lead to 45-31.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Baylor 95, No. 10 Iowa State 91--Sheila Lambert tied the
score with a three-point play and fed Nicole Collins for a
game-winning three-pointer with 7.2 seconds left at Ames, Iowa, as
the Bears (24-4, 11-5 Big 12) beat the Cyclones (21-7, 9-7) for the
11th time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert finished with 26 points, seven assists and five steals for
Baylor. Iowa State got a career-high 36 points from Angie Welle, but
did not score after Melanie Bremer's three-pointer gave the Cyclones
a 91-83 lead with 3:01 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Kansas State 74, Missouri 55--Laurie Koehn scored 27 points
at Manhattan, Kan., as the Wildcats (23-6, 11-5 Big 12) won their
11th in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats led by as many as 13 before Missouri (14-13, 5-11)
cut it to six with 10:54 left. But Nicole Ohlde responded with four
points to ignite a 7-0 run that put the Tigers away.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Colorado State 84, Air Force 40--Katie Borton scored a
career-high 21 points and added 10 rebounds at Fort Collins, Colo.,
as the Rams (22-5, 11-5 Mountain West) beat the Falcons (4-22, 0-13)
for the 13th time in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State exploited Air Force's zone defense, making five
three-pointers, in a 25-0 run to lead, 35-8.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Augspurger scored 12 points to become the 12th player in
school history to reach 1,000 points for Colorado State. Latoya
Howell had 11 points for the Falcons.</TE>

<LD>Like a Bolt From</LD>
<LD>   Out of the Bluegrass</LD>
<LD>   Soundtrack producer T Bone Burnett said the biggest thrill of the
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?" success was the recognition that has
come to bluegrass veteran Ralph Stanley and an unexpected turn of
events a week ago.</LD>
<TE>   "The first song on the album is a work-gang song by James Carter
and prisoners, recorded in 1952 at the Parchment Farm [prison] in
Mississippi," Burnett said.</TE>
<TE>   "Alan Lomax went down there and recorded these chain-gang hollers.
When royalty checks came in, we started looking for this guy, James
Carter. Last week, we found him [living in Chicago], and Friday night
the Lomax people went by and gave him a check, gave him a platinum
record. He'd never heard of the movie or the project."</TE>
<TE>   A Hip-Hop Call</TE>
<TE>   for Artist Unity</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Eve, winner of best rap/sung collaboration for her "Let Me
Blow Ya Mind" with Gwen Stefani, lamented the absence of the hip-hop
community from the Recording Artists Coalition campaign, a new
lobbying group created to give musicians a unified voice at the
legislative table.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately the hip-hop community has not come together as the
rock world has," she said. "Contracts are horrible, [though] I'm
blessed. But it's not as fair as it could be. We are the artists, we
do most of the work, and the record companies get everything."</TE>
<TE>   Pledging Allegiance</TE>
<TE>   to the United States</TE>
<TE>   Backstage after losing best album honors to "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?," U2's Bono and the Edge declared great affection for
soundtrack producer T Bone Burnett. Bono then went on to make an
eloquent love declaration for the United States, continuing the role
the band has had since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to tell you, as outsiders, as guests of the nation, we've
always loved coming here, but this year I've rediscovered my love for
America--the great idea as opposed to just the great country. It is a
great idea, worth defending, worth taking around the world."</TE>
<TE>   O Radio, Where</TE>
<TE>   Art Thou?</TE>
<TE>   In the pre-telecast portion of the show, a wave of wins for
tradition-rooted country performances was the trend, with the "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and the related "Down From the
Mountain" concert recording, the "Timeless" Hank Williams tribute
collection, bluegrass veterans Ralph Stanley and Earl Scruggs and
bluegrass-country star Alison Krauss all scoring awards.</TE>
<TE>   The winners noted that their success came despite country radio's
indifference.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of different broadcast media now," said T Bone
Burnett, who won producer of the year for his work on the "O Brother"
album, as well as "Mountain" and "Fan Dance" by his wife, Sam
Phillips. "Radio doesn't have the stranglehold it once had on the
distribution of music."</TE>

<DH>Music: Newcomer Alicia Keys, Ireland's venerable U2 and
roots-based songs of the Depression-era South earn multiple honors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A soulful young chanteuse from New York City, a soundtrack that found
musical riches buried in the Depression-era South and the rock band
that has become Ireland's most famous pop export were the disparate
characters who became the story line of the 44th Annual Grammy Awards
on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Alicia Keys, the singer-songwriter and pianist, won five Grammys,
including best new artist and song of the year for her soaring debut
hit, "Fallin,'" while the soundtrack to "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
took the prized album of the year trophy for its survey of bluegrass,
folk and blues that was itself a vivid role in the quirky film.</LD>
<LD>   "O Brother" also helped propel singer and fiddler Alison Krauss
into the Grammy history book right beside Keys. Both won five
Grammys, tying Lauryn Hill's 2000 haul for most wins on a single
Grammy night. Krauss got three of hers for her work on the
soundtrack, the rest from her work with her band, Union Station.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran rockers U2, meanwhile, walked away from the Staples Center
gala with four Grammys, including the record of the year statue for
"Walk On." Those wins cap a revival for the band that has seen its
return to the summit of the rock world with both a hit album and the
top-grossing North American tour of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting one award, lead singer Bono marveled that the quartet's
friendships could "survive commerce, being broke, not being broke,
some really lousy haircuts, the '80s" and later called his mates "a
punk band hearing mad tunes in their head."</TE>
<TE>   A more classical mind-set has informed the young career of Keys.
She began playing piano at age 7, found an early fan's passion for
Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and then became a devotee of
hip-hop--a blend that is clear in her music. Her album, "Songs in A
Minor," debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts last summer and she has
been acclaimed by critics as a major new force in R&amp;B.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to dedicate this to just thinking outside the box and
not being afraid of who you are no matter what you do," she told the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Glitter coated Keys' eyelids Wednesday and seemed appropriate for
a young woman with every reason to have stars in her eyes. Her rise
took the suspense out of the best new artist race--there was little
doubt in any quarter that she would not win--but her competition with
U2 in song and record of the year (the former honors songwriting, the
latter is for the best single track) made those categories especially
intriguing contests. In the end they split.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second year in a row that U2 won record of the year;
"Beautiful Day," also from its "All That You Can't Leave Behind"
album, took the prize last year.</TE>
<TE>   U2 was considered by many to also be a favorite in the best album
competition, as was Bob Dylan, but in the end that Grammy went to "O
Brother" in the night's biggest surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The soundtrack to the Coen brothers film won five Grammys in all,
including a best producer trophy for its chief architect, T Bone
Burnett. The album was an unexpected commercial sensation of
2001--its 4 million copies sold made it among the year's top
releases. It also inspired a tour, "Down From the Mountain," that
spawned a concert album that won in the category of best traditional
folk album.</TE>
<TE>   The "O Brother" soundtrack features such artists as Ralph Stanley,
Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station, and creates the
backdrop to the film's updating of Homer's "Odyssey" with a trio of
hapless convicts on the loose in Southern backwoods. For many casual
fans it provided a concise tour of an exotic musical landscape, in
much the same way as the hit 1997 album by the Buena Vista Social
Club became a portal to traditional Cuban pop music.</TE>
<TE>   "We are filled with gratitude not only that you have chosen to
honor this work in this way, but also because we were afforded the
chance to make it in the first place," Burnett said on stage. "And,
for the great joy that making it was."</TE>
<TE>   Still, "O Brother" has been shunned by the nation's country radio
stations and Burnett encountered considerable resistance to the
concept. "Everybody," he said, "thought I was insane."</TE>
<TE>   While tradition-bound music is unwanted by country radio powers
that prefer more pop-leaning fare, the music that looks to the past
was celebrated with enthusiasm at the Grammys this year. Among the
examples: "Timeless," a tribute disc to Hank Williams featuring Bob
Dylan, Lucinda Williams, Ryan Adams and others, won best country
album, while "The Lucky One," by Krauss and Union Station, won best
country song, although it was virtually ignored by mainstream country
radio.</TE>
<TE>   One of the awards for "O Brother" delivered the first Grammy ever
to Ralph Stanley, an august figure in Appalachian music who won the
award for best male country vocal for "O Death." Stanley's win came
two days after he celebrated his 75th birthday. "I think," he said,
"this is the best birthday I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   The Soggy Bottom Boys--whose song was memorably lip-synched by
actor George Clooney in the film--took the award for best country
collaboration with vocals for "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow." While
Stanley was new to Grammy ranks, others extended their lengthy
relationship with the gramophone-shaped trophy. Conductor Pierre
Boulez won his 24th career Grammy, moving him to No. 4 on the
all-time list of winners, while producer Quincy Jones won his 27th
Grammy (in the unexpected category of best spoken word album for a
recording of his autobiography) and now trails only by four the
all-time leader in Grammy wins, Sir Georg Solti.</TE>
<TE>   In the category of disappointment, India.Arie was the name of the
night. The neo-soul singer was nominated for seven albums, including
album, song and record of the year, but was shut out. The wounds will
be salved, though, by memories of her breakout year with the debut
album "Acoustic Soul."</TE>
<TE>   The awards show brought the usual glut of limousines and media
hordes to the downtown arena that became its West Coast home in 2000,
but amid the usual celebration there was a grim backbeat. The
business is beset by challenges that range from slumping sales to new
technologies that threaten to spread music piracy. There is also a
revolt of sorts underway by artists pushing for legislation for
seismic changes in business practices that favor the record labels.

<TE>   Recordings released between Oct. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2001, were
eligible for the 101 categories of the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. The
recording academy has 13,000 voting members.</TE>

<CX>   Grammys--A story about the Grammy Awards in Thursday's main news
section incorrectly said that five Grammys were the most any artist had
ever won on a single night. Five is the most any woman has won. In
addition, the number of awards won by Alison Krauss was incorrect. She
won three.</CX>

<LD>Classical music may be big business, but individual gumption had a
role in this year's classical Grammys. A live concert performance of
Berlioz's spectacular opera "Les Troyens," released by the London
Symphony Orchestra on its own budget label, has trumped the major
labels by taking home the best classical and best opera gold. As
chamber music winners for its 21-CD Haydn set, the locally based
Angeles String Quartet will go out with a bang when it disbands this
spring.</LD>

<LD>Yea, brother!</LD>
<LD>   The choice of "Timeless--Hank Williams Tribute" as country album
of the year was by no means a lock. In other years voters would have
overlooked this moving salute in favor of the bigger-selling "Set
This Circus Down" by Tim McGraw. But the runaway success of the "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, fluke or not, has clearly made
meatier stuff award-worthy once again.</LD>

<HD>It's Time to Nominate a New System</HD>
<DH>The Grammy voting process may have split support for
critically acclaimed albums, giving 'O Brother' the edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"O Brother"? Oh my goodness.</LD>
<LD>   Let's raise a toast to the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack
for its victory in the most prestigious Grammy category, album of the
year--and then start figuring out how to make the Grammy voting
process more credible.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy to feel good when the character and passion of American
country and roots music are celebrated with five Grammys, especially
when commercial country music has relegated this vintage sound to the
outhouse.</LD>
<TE>   But "O Brother" wasn't the most distinguished album of the year.
It wasn't even one of the three most compelling nominees in that
category.</TE>
<TE>   By most measures, Bob Dylan's "Love and Theft," U2's "All That You
Can't Leave Behind" and OutKast's "Stankonia" were more substantial
works.</TE>
<TE>   In the Village Voice's annual poll of more than 500 U.S. pop music
critics to name the best album of 2001, Dylan was the easy winner,
with "O Brother" finishing No. 19. In the Voice poll for the best
album of 2000, OutKast and U2 finished No. 1 and No. 7, respectively.
(Albums from different years may compete in the same Grammys because
the eligibility period runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30).</TE>
<TE>   So how did "O Brother" beat three far more acclaimed albums?</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is that the 13,000 Grammy voters, who are often
far more conservative in their choices than critics, simply thought
it was the strongest work.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a second possibility--one that clouds the Grammy
voting so consistently that the recording academy ought to consider
changing its voting procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Though I'd have voted for Dylan, U2 went into the competition the
overwhelming favorite, thanks to the thoughtful, inspiring tone of
its music, which took on added resonance and depth after the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The only way the album wouldn't win, pundits said, was if Dylan
drew enough votes away from U2 for a longshot--such as "O
Brother"--to sneak in. And that is just what happened, one suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Looking over previous Grammy contests, it's easy to see where
strong albums may have drawn enough votes from each other to let a
compromise choice win. In 1985, two of the great albums of the
decade--Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A." and Prince's "Purple
Rain"--went head to head in the best album category, allowing Lionel
Richie's far less memorable "Can't Slow Down" to get more votes.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, U2's deserving "The Joshua Tree" might have
benefited from a voter split between two other commercial
blockbusters, Prince's "Sign 'O' the Times" and Michael Jackson's
"Bad."</TE>
<TE>   And didn't Celine Dion's shallow "Falling Into You" win best album
in 1997 only because progressive forces Beck, the Fugees and Smashing
Pumpkins canceled out one another?</TE>
<TE>   It may be that all of these albums would have won under any
circumstances, but the chance of the voters' will being subverted
leaves too much of a doubt over the voting system for it not to be
addressed.</TE>
<TE>   One solution is a weighted system. Instead of just voting for one
artist, voters would list preferences one to five. The recording
academy brain trust was smart enough in 1995 to put the final
responsibility for choosing nominees in key categories in the hands
of a special committee. The quality of nominees has improved greatly
since then, but the final balloting now needs to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   It was encouraging to see so many quality acts receive Grammys at
Staples Center on Wednesday, including Dylan, Alicia Keys and U2, but
a weighted system could do much to increase confidence in the
integrity of the awards.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the academy ought to put a second item at the top of
its Grammy telecast agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's show was a maddening mix of stirring performances by
classy artists--from U2 and Dylan to Keys and OutKast to the "O
Brother" ensemble--and tacky sidelights.</TE>
<TE>   Emcee Jon Stewart's opening fell so flat--he stripped to his
shorts as part of a skit involving heightened security precautions
following Sept. 11--that he never recovered. After failing to regain
his comedic edge, he seemed at the end to simply be going through the
paces, eager for the final curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse was the usual award-show clutter of TV personalities
and other celebrities who traded inane comments while presenting
awards. This celebrity obsession is obviously designed to lure
viewers, but there ought to be a way to include celebrities without
insulting the intelligence of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   How absurd it is to cut short speeches by the night's key
winners--U2's Bono, Keys and "O Brother" producer T Bone
Burnett--while they let actor Ray Romano run around Staples Center
endlessly handing out door prizes to confused audience members.</TE>

<LD>There are no surprises in the category this year. The tendency to
honor established artists is best illustrated in the award to Sonny
Rollins for his album "This Is What I Do." Although it is hardly the
best work of his career, the CD provides an opportunity to honor one
of the art's great, legendary figures.</LD>
<LD>   But the most musically deserving award went to Charlie Haden for
"Nocturne" (in the Latin jazz category), an album in which gorgeous
solos by David Sanchez and Gonzalo Rubalcaba have been blended into a
subtle, engaging blend of jazz and Latin song.</LD>

<LD>The big problem in this year's Latin categories was most glaring in
rock/alternative, where L.A. favorite Ozomatli won over a stellar
field that included acclaimed albums by Juanes and Aterciopelados.
Ozomatli, the only U.S.-based entry, was arguably the weakest choice
in this competitive category. Conclusion: Name recognition won out
over musical merit, a trend that also leveraged wins by Freddy Fender
and Robert Blades, Ruben's lesser-known brother.</LD>

<LD>Alicia Keys' trifecta in the best song, album and female vocal
categories is a heartening referendum on the year's neoclassical
urban music trend, which was spearheaded by this singer-pianist.
Though it has to be one of the evening's least surprising
developments, Keys' Grammy mother lode represents perhaps the most
pleasing convergence of quality and record sales that the academy has
achieved for the last few years.</LD>

<LD>For once, the Grammys got it right on the first try. Eve and Gwen
Stefani's victory for "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" for rap/sung
collaboration signals a strong start for this new category. The sexy
record, co-produced by Dr. Dre, is a powerful statement for hip-hop
itself, demonstrating how the music incorporates elements from other
genres--in this case Stefani's pop-punk vocals--and makes them its
own.</LD>

<HD>Two Brave Hearts Travel to Music's Highlands</HD>
<DH>A pair of nominees from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra
have a fling at near-celebrity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before they reached Section 101, Row 8 of Staples Center on
Wednesday afternoon, Grammy nominees Alistair Beattie and Barry
Deacon realized they faced certain disadvantages in their quest for
glory. Their band could offer no wicked backbeat, for instance, and
there were no drop-dead beautiful bodies on their videos. There had
been no promotional campaign to speak of, and for that matter,
precious few actual record sales.</LD>
<LD>   Beattie and Deacon did, however, have kilts. Also fine Glaswegian
accents, a modest tale about a Bruckner symphony, and unassailable
celebrity connections.</LD>
<LD>   "Madonna's husband went to the same hairdresser as me, just before
their wedding," Deacon explained soon after his arrival in Los
Angeles on Monday. "And my mum is related to Lee Trevino's caddie.
Willie Aitchison."</LD>
<TE>   Beattie, 57, is a viola player and Deacon, 36, a clarinetist in
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. This year, their orchestra,
under conductor Osmo Vanska, was among four nominated in Grammy
Category 90--best orchestral performance.</TE>
<TE>   This was one of those many prizes awarded in midafternoon on
Grammy day, well before the prime-time broadcast. But the Scottish
Symphony had never been nominated before, and to seize the moment the
BBC approved certain expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   And so across the pond flew the clarinetist and viola player,
selected by their 68 peers and joined by orchestra director Hugh
Macdonald and a BBC publicist. (Vanska was unavailable.)</TE>
<TE>   On this side, they found clear skies, wobbly logistics and fickle
media persons. Clearly, the Scots stood among the Grammy proletariat,
far removed from the glitziest headliners, but far from alone. The
program included 101 categories, from best polka album to best spoken
word album for children, with five nominees in most categories.</TE>
<TE>   At least to begin with, the Scots took it all in stride, unfazed
by pop music machinery, the celebrity scene, even the cost of
admission. In the wake of confusion among the Grammy organization,
their record label and the orchestra, the BBC had to pay for the
musicians to get into the awards ceremony. Choosing some of the
costliest seats on the chance that they'd need to approach the
podium, they paid $800 per man.</TE>
<TE>   A Grammy Fishbowl,</TE>
<TE>   an L.A. Melting Pot</TE>
<TE>   True, they were a bit shaken the first two times that mix-ups kept
them separated from those tickets. And in their category, they knew
the competition was stiff: the mighty Berlin Philharmonic (nominated
twice, for one recording under Claudio Abbado and another under Kent
Nagano), the esteemed Chicago Symphony Orchestra (under Pierre
Boulez) and the estimable if less widely celebrated Bournemouth
Symphony Orchestra (under Jose Serebrier). But they had a mission,
and as surely as the Firth of Forth is wet and bisected by a bridge,
they aimed to complete it. Arriving on Monday night and due to leave
today, they had less than 72 hours to swim bravely in the strange
fishbowl that is the Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, as movers and shakers gathered at the Century
Plaza Hotel for a tribute to Billy Joel, Beattie and Deacon, cleared
customs, grabbed pasta at their hotel restaurant and slept.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, daunted by limousine prices, publicist Lyn McNicol
hired the group a taxi for the day, giving driver Asefa Pekade,
formerly of Ethiopia, a 10-hour fare of $300, plus tip. The first
stop: publicity photos, in kilts, at a park in front of the Hollywood
sign. Then, maybe a radio station, a TV interview, a photo op with
fellow Scot Rod Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "Your kilts are in shadow," warned the photographer, hired the day
before to transmit images back to newspapers in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "Do something sort of Scottish," counseled the publicist.</TE>
<TE>   This mostly involved flinging hands skyward and careful kilt
management. Each of their kilts--typically worn for weddings and
other formal occasions--carried a different clan tartan pattern.
Deacon's, borrowed from a friend, was green, blue and red; Beattie's
had yellow as well. In addition, each wore a sporran--a small,
fur-lined quasi-wallet that hung at waist level. They posed for the
photographer and for each other and then, having come from a
territory of 200 rainy days a year, gazed a bit more at the
sun-splashed Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Beattie and Deacon had not just fallen off the haggis truck. In
fact, the Scottish orchestra has won two Gramophone
Awards--London-based prizes that carry more clout than any others in
classical music--in the last decade and was nominated last week for a
Royal Philharmonic Society Music Award as the United Kingdom's
orchestra of the year. Since November 2000, the orchestra's touring
schedule has included performances in Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei,
Boston, Philadelphia and Zanesville, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "I can honestly say that we'll never forget Zanesville, Ohio,"
said Beattie, and Deacon nodded immediately, leaving the details
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The two made a complementary couple. Beattie, tall and senatorial,
has been in the orchestra since 1970. Deacon, who joined the
orchestra in 2000, sported Bart Simpson cufflinks and spoke with
great confidence of how the kilt might help him sweet-talk Britney
Spears.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got the headline already," he said. "Britney's Highland
Fling."</TE>
<TE>   Beattie was under orders from his son to buy a certain model of
trendy tennis shoes. Deacon hoped for a bit of browsing in a big CD
store.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-member Scottish orchestra, led for the last five years by
Finnish conductor Vanska, makes its performing home in Glasgow City
Hall, and it is known for its broad repertoire. The Grammy nomination
was for the orchestra's recording of Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 3
in D minor on London-based Hyperion Records.</TE>
<TE>   That symphony, written by the Austrian composer in the 1870s as an
hommage to Wagner, is full of exposed moments for individual
instrumentals--no orchestral stroll in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Estimated sales of the recording? Probably more than 5,000, said
Macdonald, the orchestra director, and probably fewer than 15,000.
Though the number seems small by pop standards, Macdonald added, he
takes them as encouraging at a time when many record companies are
reducing their commitment to classical music.</TE>
<TE>   By lunchtime Tuesday, when record industry insiders were gathering
at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel to hear a keynote address by
Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, the Scots were
at the Getty Center, marveling at Van Gogh, Turner, Monet and Manet
and dealing further with the kilt effect.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," said a female docent as they passed a fountain area, "so are
you really from Scotland or was this a bet?"</TE>
<TE>   Then as they took in the balcony view of the Pacific, a grinning
African American man, at least 6-foot-6, stepped up to introduce
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a McPhaul from Detroit," he began. "And we're long-distance
cousins."</TE>
<TE>   Then Kenneth J. McPhaul Jr.--a jazz fan from Detroit who was also
visiting town for the Grammys--explained that after winning their
freedom in the 19th century, his ancestors were taken in by a
Scottish American family named McPhaul and took on that family name.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, the view, the great American melting-pot moment--the
Scots were wide-eyed. Even when the publicist broke news that the
radio and television interviews had fallen through, even when their
office visit to pick up their Grammy tickets proved unproductive, the
momentum seemed clear. The awards were now less than 24 hours away.</TE>
<TE>   Then came tea and shortbread with British Consul General Peter
Hunt, an evening Grammy nominees party at the California Science
Center in Exposition Park, a brief radio interview for "Good Morning,
Scotland."</TE>
<TE>   The Science Center gathering was not the evening's prime party:
Clive Davis, head of J Records, was hosting that at the Beverly Hills
Hotel. But this wasn't a bad consolation. As lights danced on the
museum walls, a waitress sidled up to Deacon with a variation on the
usual kilt question:</TE>
<TE>   "Briefs or boxers?" she asked</TE>
<TE>   "Neither," he answered.</TE>
<TE>   But too soon she was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Time for the Trip Along the Red Carpet</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Scots didn't lay hands on their Grammy tickets
until the morning of the ceremony, and to do so, they had to drive
back out to the recording academy office in Santa Monica and stand in
line for nearly an hour. On the way back, they stopped to drop off a
CD at a local classical radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Then suddenly the Grammy hour was nigh, and the Scots were donning
their kilts again, tucking binoculars into their sporrans.</TE>
<TE>   "Tie all right?" asked Beattie, inspecting himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Should I have brought pants?" asked Deacon. "In case I'm
searched?"</TE>
<TE>   They caught a taxi to the arena, then had to abandon it, while
those who came in limos with security clearance passed by. They
walked the last block, then stepped up to the red carpet, with an
encouraging pause for a TV interview. Then into the hall.</TE>
<TE>   They entered, they sat, they waited. And about half an hour into
the program, the presenters delivered the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, playing Varese under the
baton of Boulez, won the best orchestral performance Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   The Scots took a breath, made a phone call to alert their
publicist, then stepped away from their seats for a bit to stretch
their legs. For the next five hours, sure as Braveheart was born in
Renfrewshire, other people would be winning prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after that would be the post-awards party, and a little
time for shopping in the morning--and that photo op with Rod Stewart,
it wasn't entirely out of the question yet.</TE>

<HD>A Time to Rebuild Afghan Hope</HD>
<DH>Reconstruction: Educator who moved to Simi Valley plans a
return to homeland to help in recovery.</DH>

<LD>Afghanistan made her strong, then broke her heart. But with the
defeat of the Taliban and formation of a new government, Kawky Anwar
sees hope for a land ravaged by war and religious extremism.</LD>
<LD>   "I was born there, raised there, got married there, had children
there, got all my education there," said the Simi Valley woman,
president of the Afghan Women Assn. of Southern California. "I had
good times and good memories of my country. I feel now that I have my
country back."</LD>
<LD>   The former vice principal of the Malalai School, one of Kabul's
largest and oldest all-girl schools, wants to return to her homeland
and help repair what the Taliban nearly destroyed.</LD>
<TE>   Malalai is in ruins, its windows smashed and its rooms stripped of
furniture, Anwar says. The 4,000 students were sent packing long ago
by the Taliban, which forbade the education of women.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from trying to raise money to rebuild the school, Anwar's
group lobbies for women's rights in Afghanistan, for female
representation in the interim government and for the disarmament and
education of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "A country without education is nothing," said Anwar, a
raven-haired 60-year-old who alternates between broad smiles and
grave seriousness.</TE>
<TE>   After the Taliban conquered most of Afghanistan in 1995,
Anwar--who had moved to the United States in 1981--decided she wanted
to help fight them. She and others formed the Afghan Women Assn. in
1997. They wrote to President Clinton, met with local congressmen and
strategized with activists such as Mavis Leno, wife of comedian Jay
Leno.</TE>
<TE>   They even sat down with visiting Taliban delegations to register
their opposition to a regime that not only refused to let women
attend school but also shut them out of most jobs and required them
to wear head-to-toe burkas whenever they left home.</TE>
<TE>   But the delegations were unmoved when Anwar told them that the
Koran, Islam's holiest book, and the prophet Muhammad, Islam's most
revered messenger, had both called for the respectful treatment of
women.</TE>
<TE>   "We would tell them this was not the way to deal with women,"
Anwar said. "They said we didn't understand Islam. They wouldn't look
at us. I would open the Koran and read to them parts about the
treatment of women, but they just thought we were stupid women."</TE>
<TE>   Former Students Recall Image of Authority</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to the United States, Anwar studied law and
political science at Kabul University and then returned to her old
high school to teach geography and history. She later became vice
principal.</TE>
<TE>   Mahbob Murtaza Yar, 36, attended the school and remembers Anwar
prowling the halls in leather jackets and miniskirts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of afraid of her," said the Fremont biochemist. "She
had that effect on you. She was a beautiful woman and a good
authority figure."</TE>
<TE>   Nazema Momand, 43, also attended Malalai.</TE>
<TE>   "Kawky Anwar was very chic and modern," said the Fremont nurse. "I
remember that she wore her hair very long. She would walk the
hallways with authority. She was serious but nice."</TE>
<TE>   Momand said the school was surrounded by green gardens and roses.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it on the news and it was all destroyed," she said. "I
cried."</TE>
<TE>   A year after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Anwar, her
husband and their three children fled to India. They were all fervent
anti-communists and had been removed from their jobs because they
didn't support the new regime.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived in New York in 1981 and moved to Canoga Park a year
later. In 1990, they came to Simi Valley. She and her husband, a
former economics professor, worked for computer companies before
retiring.</TE>
<TE>   The association has tried to help keep the Afghan language and
culture alive in Southern California. They are small in number, about
10 women and their extended families spread out from Simi Valley to
San Diego. They meet twice a month and hope to buy their own
community center someday.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley has about 13 Afghan families, Anwar said, with most
adults working in the high-technology and medical professions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest concentrations of Afghans in the United States,
between 40,000 and 50,000, live in and near Fremont in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Los Angeles is home to about 15,000 Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   The Fremont-based Afghan Women's Assn. International is a much
larger organization advocating women's rights in and out of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Kawky's group is small but it's very courageous," said Rona
Popal, founder of the international group. "Long before Sept. 11 they
held meetings with [Huntington Beach] Congressman Dana Rohrabacher
and other politicians about the rights of women in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Anwar hopes to travel to Afghanistan to discuss the country's new
constitution and how the loya jirga, or grand assembly, will choose a
new leader. California Afghans will choose 10 of their own to make
the journey.</TE>
<TE>   "If I am selected, I will tell them that women need equal rights
with men," Anwar said.</TE>
<TE>   "But some may not want us to come back. They may say we left the
country while they stayed and fought and maybe lost family members. I
would tell them that they are my boss. Some will listen and some will
not."</TE>
<TE>   Group Sent Plane Full of Goods for the People</TE>
<TE>   The new interim government includes two women. One, Minister of
Public Health Suhaila Seddiqi, went to high school with Anwar.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California group recently helped fill a plane with
food, clothing and blankets that landed in Afghanistan on Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "For three months I was watching TV and I was crying all the
time," Anwar said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no food for the kids, no shelter. I am now just praying
that my people will have a happy life. One day I hope--my last
hope--is to go see my country and go see my school."</TE>

<HD>Old-Car Owners Left in Lurch</HD>
<DH>Smog: Drivers, clean-air advocates are upset after governor
pulls the plug on vehicle-retirement program he had praised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling it a "win-win situation," Gov. Gray Davis last year praised a
popular program that paid motorists $1,000 to turn their smog-spewing
old clunkers into scrap metal.</LD>
<LD>   The only problem was that Davis had pulled the plug on the
initiative a month before he touted it--part of nearly $3 billion in
cuts to address the state's budget crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' elimination of the vehicle retirement program that he
himself boosted has surprised and angered environmentalists. It also
leaves in the lurch about 7,000 Californians who applied for the
money. Instead, they will be getting notices in the next few weeks
telling them the program has been axed.</LD>
<TE>   The program, run by the Bureau of Automotive Repair, made $1,000
payments to Californians who turned in cars that failed smog checks.
Since the program's inception in July 2000, more than 30,000 cars and
trucks have been sent to auto dismantlers for destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The auto-scrapping program was among at least 80 initiatives cut
or frozen under a Davis budget relief plan released in November. The
plan was approved by state lawmakers earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Chandrashekhar Mahatme, an engineer from the San Francisco Bay
Area community of Cupertino, is one of those thousands of motorists
who have yet to hear what will happen to their applications. He filed
in September to junk his 1984 Honda Civic.</TE>
<TE>   He called the state Bureau of Auto Repair in December and was told
his application was approved. But since then, Mahatme said, he has
received no confirmation letter or information about where to take
his car.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Honda sits in the parking lot of his apartment
building, collecting dust and irritating his landlord. Mahatme said
the clunker is not worth the $500 in repairs needed to pass the smog
check.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big problem because I don't know what to do with it," he
said. "It's not worth repairing."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Davis said the governor touted the program in
December--even after his office moved to kill it--because he was
proud of its success. Removing old cars from the road reduced
pollutants in the air by an estimated 8,500 tons annually.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean insisted that the governor did not
send a mixed message by praising the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We still support the spirit of the program and the merits," she
said. "It's never a fun position to be in, to reduce funds in a
program you care about."</TE>
<TE>   McLean noted that motorists can still apply to the Department of
Consumer Affairs for grants of up to $500 to make emission-related
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the reaction to the program's demise has been sharp.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, the state Bureau of Auto Repair has received
more than 500 calls a day from motorists asking what became of the
program, according to state officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Consumer Affairs has also received about 300
calls a day from frustrated vehicle owners, said Glen Mason, a
department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed too," he said, "because it was a great
program."</TE>
<TE>   State's Goal Met in Year and a Half</TE>
<TE>   Mason noted that the state set a goal of scrapping or repairing
50,000 emission-violating cars and trucks within four years. With
30,000 cars scrapped and an additional 20,000 repaired, the state met
that goal in only a year and a half, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups are also upset by the program's demise,
saying it was a key element in the California's efforts to reduce
harmful smog levels.</TE>
<TE>   "This will put a hole in the state's pollution-control program,"
said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   She said her group plans to press the governor to restore the
funding or create another smog-cutting initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "If the governor plans to remove it, he has to come up with a way
to fill in for that," Feuer said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Carmichael, director of the Coalition for Clean Air in Los
Angeles, said he learned of Davis' decision after a confused motorist
called his organization last month to ask about the status of the
auto-scrapping program.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael credits the program for putting thousands of
smog-spewing cars out of commission. But he noted that an estimated 2
million to 3 million other smog violators are still on the road
today.</TE>
<TE>   Local air quality regulators, such as the South Coast Air Quality
District, run similar vehicle-crushing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Those programs are funded by businesses that need "smog credits"
in order to meet state emissions standards. But such programs
typically pay about half the amount that was offered by the state
program.</TE>

<HD>Welfare Ban for Drug Felons Harms Children, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Poverty: A federal law that bars aid in such cases affects
37,825 women in California, 40% of national total.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chalon Smith, whose years of addiction began when she was barely 18,
can tell you the day she quit drinking and using drugs. It was Oct.
24, 1999, she says, the day after her arrest for possession of crack
cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 29, also can tell you the day she was released from prison:
last Nov. 19, just in time for Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   But as she sits on the bed of a sober living house in Watts, Smith
cannot tell you how she, her teenage daughter and grandson are going
to survive. Since her release from prison, Smith, like thousands of
women with felony drug convictions, has been banned from receiving
government aid for herself and her family under the provisions of the
1996 federal Welfare Reform Act.</LD>
<TE>   "If you are going to deny me cash, fine," she said. "But don't
deny my kids. They shouldn't be suffering because of my mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Smith is among more than 92,000 women--40% of them in
California--who have been barred from receiving funds under the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program because of their drug
convictions, according to a yearlong study released today.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the Sentencing Project of Washington, D.C., a
nonprofit liberal advocacy group, also found that the ban places more
than 135,000 children at risk because their mothers are without
access to welfare aid ranging from cash grants to food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   "The lifetime welfare ban ... makes the possibility of women
returning to their communities as productive members more difficult
than before their conviction, and in some cases improbable," the
study says.</TE>
<TE>   Individual states can opt out of the federal ban, and so far,
eight, including New York, Michigan and Ohio, have done so, according
to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining states either enforce the lifetime ban, adhere to a
shorter ban or tie the resumption of benefits to drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of 22 states that impose the full ban, and as a
result, 37,825 women have been declared permanently ineligible for
welfare benefits since 1996, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   That, critics say, defies logic.</TE>
<TE>   "If you commit a murder and get out of prison, you would still be
eligible for assistance," said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles). "But if you are sent to prison for drug possession, you
cannot get it."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Goldberg authored legislation to lift the ban in
California, allowing those convicted of drug possession to take part
in welfare-to-work programs and receive welfare aid if they
participate in drug treatment.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure, after winning passage in the Legislature, was
vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis on grounds that the state should not expand
eligibility for benefits at a time of "economic uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'Well, the woman was doing drugs.' And OK, I'm not
happy about that," Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "But why would you use that to not let her kids have enough food
to eat, or a house to live in, or to provide the mother some job
training" after her release from prison? she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such complaints about the law, a top aide of the ban's
author, U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), said he does not foresee the
law being changed.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to reverse the Gramm Amendment, the burden will be on
some member of the Congress to convince a majority of his colleagues
that the House and Senate should restore welfare benefits to
convicted drug dealers," said Larry Neal, Gramm's deputy chief of
staff. "That's an especially heavy burden to bear because it doesn't
even pass the laugh test."</TE>
<TE>   The new study by the Sentencing Project says the number of
California women barred from government aid is nearly four times the
number affected in the next-largest state--Illinois--that imposes the
full ban.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the impact of the law in California is
felt slightly more among whites than among women of color--19,168
white women, or 57% of the total, were convicted of felony drug
offenses, compared with 8,471 black women and 7,772 Latinas.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the study found, 52% of the women affected by the ban
are white.</TE>
<TE>   At the 3-year-old Watts sober living center called A New Way of
Life, founder and director Susan Brooks said that about one in three
women have been barred from government aid because of drug
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The women who come here have had very abusive lives. And drugs
may have been the way they coped with life," said Brooks, 50, who was
in prison for drug use almost half her adult life.</TE>
<TE>   For Chalon Smith, the sudden end to welfare benefits comes at a
time, she said, when she has kicked her addiction but is struggling
to rebuild her family.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a job at a beauty supply store ... but I barely make $100
a week," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few days, she said, she has interviews for a second
job at an oil refinery or as a telephone operator.</TE>
<TE>   But until she finds more employment, Smith said, there is no way
she can save the $615 a month she needs for an apartment that she can
share with her daughter, 15, and her daughter's infant son.</TE>
<TE>   "The two [government assistance] checks I was expecting would be
enough to move into a place," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Smith's daughter and grandson are staying with a friend
in Long Beach as she continues to live at the shelter in Watts--one
of few in the area that accepts residents who cannot cover their
basic expenses with government aid.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew going to prison, life was not supposed to be easy for me.
I'm not asking for it to be easy," Smith said. "I'm just asking for a
start."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Allard, author of the national study, said that many
states are reviewing their welfare bans for convicted drug users,
although it is unclear how many ultimately will opt out.</TE>
<TE>   There also is no indication that Congress or the Bush
administration will lift the provision at the federal level when new
welfare measures are enacted in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Allard said, the numbers of women and children affected
by the ban "are going to grow. There is no two ways about it."</TE>
<TE>   "Losing your benefits when you need them the most," Allard said,
"is really imposing a life sentence of poverty on women and their
children."</TE>

<LD>A nuclear reactor at the San Onofre power plant was shut down early
Wednesday after an equipment failure at a nearby substation, causing
a widespread blackout in San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   The reactor, which provides enough power for 1.1 million homes, is
expected to be put back into service late today, said Ray Golden,
spokesman for Southern California Edison, which operates the plant.</LD>

<LD>Victor Manuel Celis Jr. pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that
he killed a 16-year-old Kennedy High School student as the teenager
left the campus.</LD>
<LD>   Celis, 18, was charged in Superior Court in San Fernando with
murder and allegations that a rifle was used and that it was a gang
shooting.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think [Celis] was involved with what happened," said
Donald J. Calabria, Celis' attorney. "He is not a gang member."</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Ricardo Floyd was walking out of the Granada Hills
school on Sept. 13 when Celis and 16-year-old Hector Guadalupe
Ramirez drove up beside Floyd and shot him.</TE>

already has served more than 12 years for the 1988 slayings of two
federal drug agents and the attempted murder of a third.</LD>

<HD>Caro Sentencing Delayed</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge acts on request of defense attorneys, who are
seeking a new trial. Vigil is held to urge she not be executed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County judge on Wednesday postponed deciding whether to
impose the death penalty on a Santa Rosa Valley mother convicted of
killing her three young sons.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Donald D. Coleman approved a request for the
delay from attorneys for Socorro Caro, who are preparing a motion for
a new trial. Such motions are standard in death penalty cases.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman's decision to put off sentencing until March 27 was seen
as a hopeful sign by Caro's relatives and other supporters.</LD>
<TE>   "Someone up there is watching over us," said Caro's mother,
Juanita Leon, who was seated in the last row of Coleman's packed
courtroom, clutching the hands of family members on either side.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting nearby were eight of the jurors who in November found Caro
guilty of first-degree murder and recommended that she be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here for closure," one of them said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, jurors who convict defendants in capital cases then
recommend either life in prison without parole or the death penalty.
Ultimately, the sentence is up to the trial judge, who almost always
agrees with the jury's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters Hold Candlelight Vigil</TE>
<TE>   At a candlelight vigil Tuesday evening, about 50 of Caro's
supporters prayed for Coleman to spare Caro's life.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask our Father to be in the courtroom in a very powerful way
and to touch the hearts of all there," said Jim Farley, a longtime
criminal defense attorney in Ventura and a deacon at Our Lady of the
Assumption Church. "This is a time for mercy; this woman should not
be executed."</TE>
<TE>   Members of several local Roman Catholic churches have collected
hundreds of signatures on a petition opposing capital punishment for
Caro, who worshiped at Padre Serra Parish in Camarillo. Caro's lead
attorney, Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley, said her office has
received 854 letters urging clemency for the 44-year-old woman.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, Caro's attorneys distanced themselves from
the letter-writing campaign, expressing concern that the judge would
think that they or their client's family members had prompted it.</TE>
<TE>   While attempting to influence a sentencing judge is a misdemeanor,
Coleman said that he had received just four letters, which he
immediately turned over to attorneys on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned with the people who have written letters," he
said. "They're not in violation of the law--certainly not knowingly."</TE>
<TE>   Three Boys Shot in Their Sleep</TE>
<TE>   Caro shot three of her four sons as they slept on the night of
Nov. 22, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest son, who was 13 months old, was unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Caro was using the boys to punish her
physician husband, Dr. Xavier Caro, for restricting her funds and
planning to divorce her. Defense attorneys unsuccessfully claimed
that Xavier Caro killed the boys and then shot his wife in the head
to make it appear as if she had attempted suicide.</TE>

<DH>Project: Bel-Air youths bring love of reading to Canoga
Park school.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an animated reading of "Clifford's Birthday Party," 11-year-old
Esther Zuckerman closed the book and looked down at the five Winnetka
Elementary first-graders sitting at her feet.</LD>
<LD>   "This is going to be in your library, so you can read it over and
over again," said the girl wearing red glasses and a purple and gold
"Cat in the Hat"-style hat.</LD>
<LD>   Esther was one of 13 students from the Mirman School in the
Sepulveda Pass who traveled to Canoga Park on Wednesday to deliver
1,455 books they had collected from family and friends. After
dropping off the books in the school library, the Mirman students,
11- and 12-year-olds, picked their favorite stories to read to
younger Winnetka students.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm reading all these books I used to read when I was little,"
said Rebecca Baroukh, 12, clutching "The Little Engine That Could."</TE>
<TE>   "This book has a moral," she said. "It teaches you to never give
up."</TE>
<TE>   A West Hills-based nonprofit organization introduced the Mirman
students to the Winnetka school. BookEnds partners schools needing
books with students willing to collect and deliver them.</TE>
<TE>   The group coordinates the relationships between donors and
recipient schools, but students really do all the work, said Patricia
Simonson, a BookEnds program assistant.</TE>
<TE>   At Mirman, a private school in Bel-Air for gifted students, six
hours of community service is required of each student. For this
project, students held a book drive earlier this month. After
collecting the books, the students boxed them for delivery this week.</TE>
<TE>   "They take it from step A to Z," Simonson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mirman students wore hats reminiscent of the one worn by the
cat in Dr. Seuss' famous book to mark the nationwide reading
celebration, Read Across America. The annual event, a National
Education Assn. project, calls for schoolchildren to read in the
company of an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Read Across America occurs on Dr. Seuss' birthday,
March 2, but this year, since the Mirman students were scheduled to
visit on Wednesday, the Winnetka administration decided to celebrate
a few days early.</TE>
<TE>   Winnetka Principal Maria Nini Villasenor said her students are
twice as lucky as most. They can first enjoy the Mirman students
reading to them, and then treasure the books they leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to have a major impact on the classroom because kids
will love [the books]," Villasenor said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using crowbars to pry open doors or torches to melt through plastic
windows, burglars have broken into nearly two dozen schools in
Anaheim and Fullerton in the past three months and hauled off scores
of classroom computers, televisions, VCRs and electronic devices.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of late-night stakeouts, police Monday arrested a
suspect in the case. A few weeks earlier, another suspect was
arrested and charged with possession of stolen property. Authorities
said the break-ins have stopped since the arrests but believe other
suspects are at large.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 elementary, secondary and private school classrooms
have been hit, with some schools being raided more than six times,
according to officials.</LD>
<TE>   Educators are now struggling to replace the stolen equipment, but
say they can't replace all of it--particularly the teaching programs
and class assignments stored on many of the computers' hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   The break-ins began shortly before Christmas and continued until
this week, according to Anaheim and Fullerton elementary school
officials.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, thieves pried open doors, broke windows or removed
louvered panels. The schools didn't have burglar alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Officers made their first arrest Feb. 13, alleging that Danny Lee
Snell, 38, of Anaheim was in possession of numerous stolen items. The
second suspect, Steven Warren Knight, 32, of Anaheim, was arrested
early Monday after he tried to run from police who reportedly watched
as he tried to break into Guinn Elementary School in Anaheim. He was
booked on four counts of burglary, five counts of receiving stolen
property, one count of felony evasion and a motor vehicle violation.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Two men are suspected of stealing electronic
equipment from more than 50 O.C. classrooms.</DH>

<LD>Using crowbars to pry open doors or torches to melt through plastic
windows, burglars have broken into nearly two dozen schools in
Anaheim and Fullerton in the past three months and hauled off scores
of classroom computers, televisions, VCRs and electronic devices.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of late-night stakeouts, police Monday arrested a
suspect in the case. A few weeks earlier, another suspect was
arrested and charged with possession of stolen property. Authorities
said the break-ins have stopped since the arrests but believe other
suspects are at large.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 elementary, secondary and private school classrooms
have been hit, with some schools being raided more than six times,
according to officials.</LD>
<TE>   Educators are struggling to replace the stolen equipment, but say
they can't replace all of it--particularly the teaching programs and
class assignments stored on many of the computers' hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the thefts occurred at elementary schools, and educators
say the break-ins have stymied lesson plans and burdened younger
students who used the equipment. "When you open your classroom door
and find the door pried open, the cupboards open and three computer
towers missing, there's a feeling of real violation," said Joan
Pettite, principal of Sunkist Elementary School. The Anaheim school
was broken into in January, and teachers and students are still
trying to cope.</TE>
<TE>   "It's derailed several courses for at least a week," Pettite said.
"Also, teachers had their lesson plans and presentations on the hard
drives. They're gone now and it'll take months for them to reproduce
them."</TE>
<TE>   The break-ins began shortly before Christmas and continued until
this week, according to Anaheim and Fullerton elementary school
officials.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, thieves pried open doors, broke windows or removed
louvered panels. The schools didn't have burglar alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not released an itemized list of the stolen items, but
say they also include personal radios, walkie-talkies and at least
one candy jar.</TE>
<TE>   A few of items have been recovered as a result of two arrests,
according to Anaheim police.</TE>
<TE>   Officers made their first arrest Feb. 13, alleging that Danny Lee
Snell, 38, of Anaheim was in possession of numerous stolen items.
Police say they had Snell under surveillance and watched as he left
his home with two bags, entered a waiting car and drove to a
Greyhound station and boarded a bus to North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Officers stopped the bus shortly after it left the station and
took Snell, a parolee, into custody. Police said they recovered a
portable radio, walkie-talkies and a compact disc player. Police say
the items were linked to stolen school property. He faces charges of
possession of stolen property and violating his parole.</TE>
<TE>   The second suspect, Steven Warren Knight, 32, of Anaheim, was
arrested early Monday after he tried to run from police who
reportedly watched as he tried to break into Guinn Elementary School
in Anaheim. He was booked on four counts of burglary, five counts of
receiving stolen property, one count of felony evasion and a motor
vehicle violation.</TE>
<TE>   "The burglaries have stopped since we've made these arrests,"
Anaheim Police Sgt. Mike Hidalgo said. "But our investigators say the
thefts may involve others." While officials at the Fullerton School
District say they have begun installing alarms in two elementary
schools that were hit a total of 12 times, trustees at the Anaheim
City School District say the cost of taking such a precaution is
prohibitive. They say, however, that they are increasing security
details. In Fullerton, officials said that equipment worth perhaps
tens of thousands of dollars was taken from Richman and Woodcrest
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   So far, school officials have been unable to place a monetary
value on the loss. Many of the computers were several years old or
older and had depreciated greatly in value. "The older computers are
considered to have no cash value for insurance purposes," Anaheim
City School District spokeswoman Suzy Brown said. Although many of
the computers had no cash value, their loss has been great in terms
of educating area children.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a lot of value to those kids who used them every day,"
Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Heroic Actions of 3 Honored</HD>
<DH>Awards: D.A. recognizes residents whose courageous deeds
helped catch crime suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Southland residents were honored for their courage Wednesday by
the Los Angeles County district attorney, including a Burbank man who
chased down and captured a suspected armed robber last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Asmar Chabbo, 29, of Burbank, Laura Hollis, 52, of Altadena and
Andrew Tait, 37, of Simi Valley received Courageous Citizen awards at
a noontime ceremony in Pasadena. The awards are given several times a
year to recognize "citizens in the community who put themselves in
harm's way to bring criminals to justice," said Jane Robison, a
spokeswoman for the district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "These people we honor by their acts are extraordinary people who
have displayed extraordinary courage," said Sandi Gibbons of the
district attorney's office. But, she added, those in law enforcement
recommend that observers of a crime try to be good witnesses rather
than putting themselves in harm's way.</LD>
<TE>   "It's better to be a live witness than a dead hero," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chabbo was lauded for an incident in May in which he and a friend
eating at a Burbank fast-food restaurant heard a scream and turned to
see a man jump over the counter, flash a gun and threaten the cashier
and other patrons, Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman grabbed some cash, shouted more threats and then took
off on a bicycle. Authorities said he might have gotten away had
Chabbo not run after him, dragged him from his bicycle and wrestled
away the gun. Chabbo then pinned the man down, holding him to the
ground until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very bold thing to do," Robison said. "It turned out the
suspect had a BB gun, but [Chabbo] didn't know that at the time. The
employees and customers thought it was a semiautomatic."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect has been charged and is to begin trial on March 25.</TE>
<TE>   Hollis' award signified an act of courage at a time of deep sorrow
in January 2001, when, on the day after her home had been
burglarized, she discovered the body of her slain son under a pile of
clothing. Authorities credited Hollis for preserving the crime scene
and remaining composed throughout the investigation. She ultimately
testified against the gang member charged with the crime, resulting
in his murder conviction and a sentence of 61 years to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, as Tait and his family were shopping at a West Valley
mall, he heard a woman screaming for help as a man ran toward him.</TE>
<TE>   Tait tripped the man and held him for police, who said the man was
molesting a teenage girl before the witness' screams chased him away.</TE>
<TE>   The molester, who was free on bail on suspicion of a similar crime
in Ventura County, was convicted and sentenced to two years in
prison.</TE>

<HD>Council Again Denies Permit for Nude Dance Club</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Owner of Frisky Kitty in Tarzana will keep
operating while he challenges city in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city's crusade to boot a Tarzana juice bar featuring nude dancers
moved forward Wednesday as the Los Angeles City Council for the
second time in three years rejected the owner's request for
permission to operate.</LD>
<LD>   But Dean Gettleson, owner of the Frisky Kitty at 18454 Oxnard St.,
will continue to stage nude entertainment as he challenges the city
in court, according to his lawyer, Roger Jon Diamond.</LD>
<LD>   Diamond, a well-know constitutional lawyer, has battled the City
Council before--successfully. He convinced Superior and appellate
court judges to overturn the council's 1999 decision denying
Gettleson permission to convert his business from a bikini bar to a
nude juice bar.</LD>
<TE>   And he vowed Wednesday to return to court, arguing that the city
has failed to prove that there are other areas in the city where
Gettleson could move. At issue is the application of a city ordinance
that prohibits adult entertainment within 500 feet of residential
areas. The Frisky Kitty violates that ordinance, both sides agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no objections to nude bars, only where they may be
located," Leonard Shaffer, vice president of the Tarzana Property
Owners Assn., told the council.</TE>
<TE>   "If we sit by and let this happen, it will devastate
neighborhoods," said Councilman Dennis Zine, whose district includes
the club. "This location has not shown to be a good neighbor, and has
become an eyesore in that particular part of the community."</TE>
<TE>   The courts have ruled that the city's denial in 1999 was not
supported by sufficient evidence that there were other locations in
the city that were reasonably available for such an adult business.</TE>
<TE>   An appeals court also said the city needed to provide more detail
on areas where an adult business could locate.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, city Zoning Administrator Daniel Green presented the
council with maps of four areas of the Valley that he said were
available for such businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said the council action was improper because the city did
not give him those maps until Tuesday, which did not give his client
enough time to examine those areas.</TE>
<TE>   He said the action violates his client's free-speech rights.</TE>
<TE>   The maps include industrial and commercial areas just north and
east of Van Nuys Airport. City officials released photographs of four
buildings with "for rent" signs in the areas, but Diamond said his
investigation found all four buildings were either too close to
residential areas or were already rented. One of the buildings,
Diamond said, was on city property at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to the so-called representative samples and proved
systematically and conclusively that none of them is available,"
Diamond told the council, which rejected his request for a delay so
he can survey other properties in the areas identified by the city.</TE>
<TE>   The council action was welcomed by neighbors of the business.</TE>
<TE>   Don Goodman, who owns a business nearby, said the location is
inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls have gone out in their skimpy outfits and actually had
catfights in the alleyway," Goodman said.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said there had been no arrests at the business for more
than a year, but a Los Angeles police officer testified that he has
made arrests in the area for drinking in public and narcotics.</TE>

<HD>O.C. District Attorney Race Heats Up</HD>
<DH>Election: Mass mailer from incumbent's office prompts
complaint. His foe faces criticism from ex-campaign manager.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An already-fierce race for Orange County district attorney has turned
even more combative, with incumbent Tony Rackauckas under scrutiny
for a mass mailing sent out at public expense and challenger Wally
Wade drawing criticism from his former campaign manager.</LD>
<LD>   Government watchdog Shirley Grindle, a Wade supporter, has asked
the state Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate whether
a district attorney's office survey, mailed to 2,500 county
residents, violated a state law prohibiting such mass mailings.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas' office defended the mailing, saying it wasn't used for
campaign purposes. State law prohibits mailings of 200 pieces or more
at public expense if office-holders are named or sign the document,
as Rackauckas did.</LD>
<TE>   Wade, however, said the survey read more like a campaign piece and
considered it a misuse of public funds. One question on the survey
says, "Due to the efforts of the district attorney, there is a high
level of justice in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the mass mailing arose last week. Rackauckas'
office said the survey, also sent out in 2000, was used to complete
an annual job-performance evaluation required of county managers.</TE>
<TE>   "Public surveys [allow] the department to judge the effectiveness
of its efforts and whether it has been successful in achieving its
goals and carrying out its mission," Rackauckas said in a written
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Chuck Middleton said Action Mailing
Inc. of Placentia conducted the confidential survey of randomly
selected households. The results haven't been tabulated, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's a business purpose behind it, it shouldn't fall
under" the law, he said. "Until the FPPC talks to us, I can't agree
there's a violation."</TE>
<TE>   Middleton said other county departments conduct surveys as a way
of measuring job performance.</TE>
<TE>   County officials, however, said they knew of no other department
that sent out similar public mass mailings.</TE>
<TE>   The county requires each department to set goals every year that
can be measured, county spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. Individual
departments choose how to measure their own performance, she said.</TE>
<TE>   County Counsel Benjamin de Mayo said his office advises elected
officials that they can send mass mailings at public expense only if
they don't include the official's name, signature or photograph. The
Rackauckas survey included his name and signature.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach said he unwittingly
violated the mass-mailing law shortly after he was elected in March
1995 to fill the unexpired term of Robert L. Citron. Citron resigned
and served jail time as a result of Orange County's December 1994
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said he sent a notice with 1995 tax bills introducing
himself as the new treasurer and assuring taxpayers that the problems
of the office were being corrected.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he said, he got a call from Webster J. Guillory, now
county assessor, warning him that the mailing violated state law.</TE>
<TE>   "I went straight to county counsel, and they said I'd violated
it," Moorlach said Wednesday. "I wrote to the FPPC and apologized.
They said it was a violation and I guess because of how I handled it,
they just put a letter [of reprimand] in my file."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department has hired Chapman University to conduct
periodic telephone surveys of residents' concerns about crime, but
the surveyors don't mention Sheriff Michael S. Carona by name,
spokesman Jon Fleischman said.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle said the district attorney survey smacked of
electioneering because the questionnaires were to be returned by Nov.
30, a week before ballot statements were due.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Wade and his backers questioned the survey, his former
campaign manager, Cathy Barry, held a news conference to accuse him
of improperly soliciting donations from district attorney employees.
She said she quit the Wade campaign in January because Wade solicited
funds from employees--a violation of state law--and took donations in
cash to avoid reporting requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Wade denied the charges and said he fired Barry because she was
ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "If an employee attempted to give me a contribution, I returned
it," Wade said. "I have reported every contribution I have received."</TE>

<HD>Feud Brings Out Support for Challenger</HD>
<DH>Politics: Even though Mark Ridley-Thomas seems likely to
win Assembly nomination, rival Mike Davis gets high-profile backing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas is the odds-on
favorite to win Tuesday's Democratic primary in the 48th Assembly
District, anchored in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The 47-year-old councilman, who has served more than a decade, has
far more name recognition, endorsements, volunteers and money (more
than half a million dollars in contributions) than his rivals.</LD>
<LD>   But that hasn't stopped several high-profile African American
politicians and celebrities from throwing their support to another
Democrat, Mike Davis, a senior deputy to county Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who has feuded with
Ridley-Thomas for a decade, has handed out fruit tree saplings in
South Los Angeles to encourage votes for Davis, who once worked for
her. And basketball great turned businessman Earvin "Magic" Johnson
and his wife, Cookie, held a Davis reception this month at their
Beverly Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   It was a reminder of how Ridley-Thomas' sometimes-abrasive style
has cost him support.</TE>
<TE>   Waters and Ridley-Thomas bitterly clashed in 1995 when he
supported a townhouse project for first-time buyers in his district.</TE>
<TE>   The project was opposed for years by nearby residents of a
middle-class neighborhood--including Waters. Ridley-Thomas won when
Mayor Richard Riordan's veto of the project was overturned by the
council.</TE>
<TE>   When Ridley-Thomas first won his council seat in 1991, Waters
lined up against him, supporting her longtime deputy, Roderick
Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Wright went on to represent the 48th Assembly District, which he
is now vacating because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, termed out of his council seat, finds himself again
facing another former Waters deputy in Davis.</TE>
<TE>   A third Democrat, Roberto Garcia, a graduate student at USC, is
also running. Libertarian Nolayan Herdegen, a businessman, and
Republican Gerard Robinson, an educator, are running unopposed in
their primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Because the district is overwhelmingly Democratic, the winner of
the Democratic primary is virtually assured of victory in November.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Says Colleague Has 'Grudge'</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas says he is baffled by Waters' support of Davis.
"It's a grudge, and it's personal," the councilman said. "She has
asserted that as far as she is concerned I don't deserve a free ride.
She's setting herself up to face defeat."</TE>
<TE>   Waters says Davis, who worked for her for nine years, "is
soft-spoken, a humble man, a gentleman to people," Waters said. "Mark
is seen as arrogant, egotistical and disrespectful of folks."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the support of Waters, Burke and Johnson, most observers
give Davis little chance. His campaign has raised only $74,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas gets high marks in most quarters for bringing in
hundreds of millions of dollars in development to his council
district and for creating an active "empowerment congress," a model
for the new city charter's system of neighborhood councils.</TE>
<TE>   He takes credit for supporting the development of seven
supermarkets, five senior citizens' complexes and six child-care
centers.</TE>
<TE>   One of those projects, Chesterfield Square, a $53-million shopping
center in South-Central Los Angeles, was built by a group that
included professional football player Keyshawn Johnson, a Los Angeles
native.</TE>
<TE>   Political commentator Kerman Maddox, who also teaches political
science at Southwest College, said: "Mark is smart, an intellectual
who works hard. He does deliver, but his style can rub people the
wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has a reputation as a hard worker. He has been
instrumental in helping create the Maxine Waters Employment
Preparation Center and the Denzel Washington Pediatric Center at
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. More recently, as Burke's
deputy, he helped develop Magic Johnson County Park and he assisted
Johnson's development of a movie theater complex in Baldwin Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Forced to Reject Police Union Support</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates oppose Mayor James K. Hahn in his effort to block
the renewal of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' contract.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue created a headache for Davis: In a district where
support for Parks is high, Davis was forced to reject an endorsement
by the Police Protective League--which has led the campaign to oust
the chief.</TE>
<TE>   "Who ever heard of the candidate who gets the police union
endorsement and can't use it?" asked Raphael Sonenshein, a political
scientist at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas drew criticism when he dropped his support for a
group led by Magic Johnson that sought to rebuild the deteriorating
Santa Barbara Plaza on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Ridley-Thomas withdrew his support for the project
after Johnson refused to support the councilman's plan to put a
National Football League franchise at the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Ridley-Thomas acted in retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not on his agenda, he's going to get you," Johnson
said. "When I went with another proposal for a football team, he took
it personal."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said: "I'm responsible to my constituents and not to
any developer, no matter what his status may be, no matter how
popular he may be." He said Johnson wanted more city funds for the
Santa Barbara Plaza project than the city could justify.</TE>

<HD>Man Killed Outside Concert</HD>
<DH>Crime: Argument escalates into violence at Galaxy theater
in Santa Ana. Patron from Inglewood is shot.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A musician from Inglewood was shot and killed late Tuesday after he
got into an argument with other patrons at a hip-hop concert in Santa
Ana, police said Wednesday.Estavan Rivera, 24, was shot several times
outside the Galaxy Concert Theater, 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana
Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said.</LD>
<LD>   Officers said Rivera, who was not performing at the concert, ran
back into the theater, where he collapsed and later was pronounced
dead. "Our place is pretty shook up about this," said Gary Folgner,
who has owned the concert hall for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Folgner canceled Wednesday night's concert.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to take a look at what happened, how it happened and how
we can prevent it,'' Folgner said.</TE>
<TE>   About 250 customers and 15 security guards watched musical
performances by Street Platoon, Ill Fame, Asian Underground and Rhyme
Poetic Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Folgner said a small group of customers began yelling at each
other during the concert and eventually went outside. He said he
didn't know what prompted the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that when the victim left the concert hall, he was
confronted by two men who opened fire before jumping into a waiting
car and fleeing. It was unclear how many people were riding in the
car, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had problems before," Folgner said. "It's meant to be
entertainment and fun."</TE>
<TE>   He said the victim was a band member in the group OTW, which did
not perform Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   A police investigation is continuing.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Seeks to Divert Money From L.A. to State Power
Purchases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The head of the state Senate Budget Committee moved Wednesday to
strip $130million from the city of Los Angeles and divert it to the
state's power-buying fund, calling it payback for the high prices Los
Angeles charged the state during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) directed a Senate budget
subcommittee to divert $130 million of $400 million the state is
expected to give Los Angeles to make up for revenues lost when the
Legislature cut vehicle license fees.</LD>
<LD>   The money should instead go to the state Department of Water
Resources to ease the burden of electricity purchases on the
customers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, Peace said.</LD>
<TE>   The state water department has been buying power on behalf of
those utility customers since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The $130 million is Peace's estimate of how much the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power earned in "excess profit" by
overcharging the state agency as it sold surplus electricity from May
2000 through May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Wading into election-year politics, Peace said former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan--now a GOP candidate for governor--could have
offered electricity for sale at slightly above cost and thus helped
prevent the hemorrhaging of billions of dollars by the utilities and
state to pay for power.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan insisted on being a pirate," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's management of the city's utility during the electricity
crisis has become grist in the governor's race, with opponents
accusing the former mayor of trying to earn top prices at the expense
of the rest of the state. Riordan has said he was concerned that the
city cover all of its costs.</TE>
<TE>   Peace cannot unilaterally shift the money. The subcommittee he
instructed to redirect the funds is headed by state Sen. Richard
Polanco, (D-Los Angeles), who did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Controller Laura Chick said the loss of the money
would compound the city's already shrinking revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "To take another $130 million would be catastrophic," she said.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Rivals in GOP Race Launch New Attacks</HD>
<DH>Election: Riordan and Simon target each other. Jones says
they both showed up late to the Republican Party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three top Republican candidates for governor continued their
fight Wednesday over who stands truest to GOP values, bickering over
taxes, truth-telling and--improbably--San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Riordan and Bill Simon Jr. broadcast new ads attacking
each other, even as Riordan lamented the campaign's negative tone.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Jones took to the steps of Los Angeles City Hall to criticize
former Mayor Riordan's eight-year residency and to accuse Riordan and
Simon of showing up late to the Republican Party.</LD>
<TE>   But it was Brown--the liberal Republicans love to hate--who became
the subject of the most vigorous finger-pointing after an article in
the San Jose Mercury News offered a Simon link to Brown's successful
1999 reelection campaign</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper reported that SKS-Simon, a joint venture of Simon's
family investment company and a San Francisco developer, gave $95,000
to an organization that funded a series of last-minute, pro-Brown
election mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, asked about the contribution during a campaign stop in
Burbank, said he had "no responsibility for that whatsoever, no
knowledge of it, no part in the decision."</TE>
<TE>   He compared his investment company to a bank that provides
homeowner loans. "You don't tell them what color to paint the house,"
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the revelation was fodder for Riordan and Jones, who seized
on the contribution as evidence that Simon--who touts himself as the
one undiluted conservative in the race--had been less than
forthcoming about his political past.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who started the campaign as Simon's friend and even urged
him to run for governor, denounced his rival as a hypocrite.</TE>
<TE>   "He's somebody that's given 10 times as much to Willie Brown as I
gave to Willie Brown. And yet he sat silent while I was getting beat
up on that issue," Riordan said at an appearance in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor, who has been battered by opponents for his
generous support of Democratic campaigns and causes, donated $10,000
in 1990 to the Committee for an Independent Legislature, which was
established by then-Assembly Speaker Brown to promote the election of
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, whose once-commanding lead over Simon has evaporated
under a withering advertising assault, campaigned at a beachfront
construction site, surrounded by electricians in yellow hard hats.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate won applause from the nonunion electricians when he
vowed to allow contractors to bid on public contracts regardless of
whether they employ union members.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not anti-union," he said. "I think that workers have a right
to be members of a union. But workers also have a right not to be
members of a union."</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the campaign, Riordan at one point lamented the
negative tone of the race. "The campaigning that's been done, it's
disgusting," he said. "... It's the wrong, wrong message to give to
our voters."</TE>
<TE>   But he also suggested that he may have erred by not striking back
forcefully enough at Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who has spent
millions on attack ads in the GOP primary. "Maybe I haven't been out
there hitting hard enough," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no such hesitation Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan pressed his criticism of Simon with a new radio spot
citing his rival's lack of political experience and renewing attacks
on the first-time candidate for failing to vote in past elections. On
a more personal note, the ad drew a contrast between the way each man
acquired his considerable wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan, a self-made businessman, turned failing companies
around," the ad stated. "Bill Simon inherited his family's
multimillion-dollar investment company."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the claim at his second stop of the day--a tour of a
guitar factory in Fullerton--Simon replied, "Once again, Dick's
factually wrong. The record is clear. I've been a successful
businessman.... I'd stack my record up against Dick's."</TE>
<TE>   Simon responded even more forcefully on the airwaves, with a new
negative spot on taxes. "Dick Riordan advocated for nearly a dozen
tax increases over the past decade," the TV spot charged, and it
reprised Riordan's June 2000 description of former President Bill
Clinton as "the greatest leader of the free world."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a handful of pro-Simon legislators gathered on the
Capitol steps to bash Riordan on the tax issue.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing Simon's ad, they faulted Riordan for failing to support
President Bush's proposed tax cut and backing a tax increase proposed
by Clinton in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "Either you're in favor of tax cuts, or you're not," said state
Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside). "Bill Simon has pledged not to raise
taxes ... and Dick Riordan has equivocated every single time he's had
the chance to make that pledge."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters afterward, a Riordan spokesman rejected that
characterization, saying the ex-mayor is "the only candidate in the
race who has a record of not raising taxes" during two terms in City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you have Bill Simon, who hasn't even bothered to vote on
basic bond and tax issues that were vital to Los Angeles," said Kevin
Spillane, political director of Riordan's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Secretary of State Jones seized on a grab bag of
issues--the size of the city's government, contributions to Willie
Brown, Simon's spotty voting record--to argue that he alone has the
experience in elected office and Republican politics to beat Davis in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Straining to be heard over the sound of downtown traffic, Jones
said of his opponents, "They don't vote. They give to whoever they
think is going to win and then they turn around and expect the
Republican Party to support them when they have not been there for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting that Simon lacked government experience and Riordan
lacked a true Republican pedigree, Jones said to win in November the
GOP needs to offer Californians "a real choice... a Republican

<DH>Montecito: Residents say Miramar Hotel project has become
an eyesore. New owner apologizes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTECITO</DL>
<LD>The showdown was only minutes away, and there was an edge to the
crowd. They filed into the school auditorium, made their choices
among the bottled waters, the little wrapped mints, the Guatemalan
roast and Costa Rican decaf, then settled into their seats.</LD>
<LD>   There he stood, the target of their wrath: Ian Schrager, famed
former owner of New York's Studio 54, convicted federal tax cheat,
millionaire hotel owner and, most important to this group, accused
defiler of one of California's most exclusive coastal enclaves.</LD>
<LD>   He smiled out at them, jaunty in faded jeans, blue blazer, crisp
white shirt with pen clipped just over the second button, a man
prepared not only to listen but even to take notes. He nodded like a
middleweight hoping for the best. "I'm ready," he said.</LD>
<TE>   It had all started happily enough in 1998, when Schrager bought
Montecito's landmark Miramar Hotel, whose blue-roofed cabins just off
Highway 101 long symbolized a kind of funky California beach chic.</TE>
<TE>   Montecito is old money and proud of it, a place of country roads
and gated mansions where the 10,000 or so residents guard their
privacy. It's also new money and celebrity: Oprah Winfrey recently
bought a $50-million estate.</TE>
<TE>   The Miramar had always had a down-to-earth quality. In its
100-year history, guests have included Ronald Reagan, Hubert Humphrey
and a mix of Hollywood names. But it was a place for ordinary
tourists, too. No pretensions.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel fit Montecito, and the community supported Schrager's
plans for a classy renovation.</TE>
<TE>   The bulldozers arrived, century-old palms were uprooted, old
bungalows were put up on blocks. Then, about 15 months ago,
everything stopped. As time passed, the 13-acre site became the
community eyesore, and the fate of the Miramar turned into the
hottest issue in town.</TE>
<TE>   The leading citizens of Montecito--rich, smart and a formidable
match for any errant developer--had grown increasingly frustrated
since work stopped. Schrager had betrayed them by halting
construction without explanation, they thought.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tuesday night, and the man who had survived a cocaine
arrest, raids by the IRS, a federal prison term for tax fraud and a
movie about Studio 54 starring Mike Myers had finally come to town to
face them.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Pannkuk, president of the Montecito Assn., one of the
community's institutional guardians, opened the meeting the way she
used to when she was negotiating contracts for the U.S. Defense
Department--straight to the point.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last year, no issue has been bigger than the future of our
beloved Miramar Hotel," Pannkuk said. "Its current appearance has
been described as half correctional facility and half ghost town.
That simply isn't acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a unique community," Pannkuk said, affronted by
Schrager's failure to maintain the Miramar's sprawling grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us have gardeners who come at least once a week. We
expect nothing less from you," she told Schrager.</TE>
<TE>   The Montecito Assn. was demanding that Schrager immediately hire
landscapers to spruce up the perimeter of the resort's grounds, and
install a uniformed security guard on the property at least from dawn
to dusk, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There has already been a major graffiti incident," said Pannkuk,
glaring pointedly at Schrager. "And transients have been seen in the
area."</TE>
<TE>   This was Schrager's cue. He stepped to the microphone. "I'm
terribly sorry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This owner of a chain of acclaimed hotels around the world, a man
who had spent $50 million to renovate San Francisco's Clift Hotel
last year, told the crowd he had stopped the Miramar project for
financial reasons.</TE>
<TE>   He would immediately comply with the association's requests,
Schrager promised. In fact, he might start early on a planned sound
wall along the property, shielding it from view until construction is
finished. And he would pursue other short-term cosmetic fixes, he
vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Schrager denied rumors that he had run out of money or is trying
to unload the property and make a quick profit by selling it to some
other developer.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that he has spent $50 million so far on the property
and will need to spend an additional $60million or so to complete the
planned 213-room hotel complex.</TE>
<TE>   And his original vision stands, he said: a seaside resort with an
English cottage feel, facing the sea instead of the highway,
surrounded by acres of gardens and orchards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of money in this. I still have that dream," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "First there was a softening of the economy," he offered as
explanation for all the delays. "Hotel occupancy rates were dropping.
We had to be cautious. And then came Sept. 11, and everything
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am encouraged now," he said. "The economy is improving. I
have come here to ask you to be a little more patient with us."</TE>
<TE>   Schrager was on a roll. But it wasn't enough for some of the 100
residents squeezed into the Montecito Union School auditorium on San
Ysidro Road. Actress Eva Marie Saint and her husband, Jeffrey Hayden,
helped lead the public scolding.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry doesn't get it for me," Hayden said. "You go back to New
York and you drive in your limousine and you buy your tickets to the
Met, and we have to look at that mudhole. It is your mistake we are
having to live with."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Schrager, "I would ask you to believe a little bit
longer. If I've lost your trust, I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Rising from her seat, Saint quietly reprimanded Schrager for
making himself impossible to reach during most of the past year,
dodging their efforts to get the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what to expect tonight," he said later. "I don't
know if this did any good or not."</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think we got any answers," said Saint. "At least
he was here. I give him credit for that. It took some courage."</TE>

<HD>County Mock Trial Contest Narrows Down to 4</HD>
<DH>Education: One school from Ventura and three from Thousand
Oaks face off today to see who advances to state competition in San
Jose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wearing business suits and their best courtroom demeanors, more than
350 high school students converged on the Hall of Justice this week
for the 19th annual Ventura County Mock Trial competition.</LD>
<LD>   During two nights of marathon legal maneuvers, 18 scholastic teams
from throughout the county presented a fictitious criminal case
before real-life judges, while panels of practicing attorneys scored
them on how convincingly they played the roles of prosecutors,
defense lawyers, bailiffs and witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the preliminary rounds concluded at 10 p.m. Tuesday,
the field had been narrowed to four high schools: Ventura's Buena and
Thousand Oaks' La Reina, Thousand Oaks and Westlake. The winning
team, which advances to the state championships in San Jose next
month, will be named after the "final four" square off again tonight.</LD>
<TE>   Like many of the parents and professionals who watched the
students make motions, offer up objections and deliver impassioned
closing arguments, Christine Harrison, the faculty advisor for
Westlake High School's team, marveled at the transformation the
teenagers underwent once they entered the courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Giggly little 16-year-olds will start striding and turn into
these poised, confident, well-spoken attorneys," Harrison said. "To
watch some of these girls go from shy, retiring types to speaking
about the Constitution with the judge for 10 minutes is very
satisfying."</TE>
<TE>   Members of La Reina's team, last year's defending champions, said
they were relieved to be among the finishers. The school has won the
county contest eight times in the last 11 years, and the perennial
powerhouse felt extra pressure from its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "We know people come in trying to beat us," said La Reina senior
Sanda Heinz, 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back on Thursday to kick lips," added teammate Cory
Tripp.</TE>
<TE>   Coupling the theatrics of drama club with the rivalry of athletic
contests, mock trial is an extracurricular activity meant to foster
teenagers' appreciation for the American legal system while improving
their public speaking and critical thinking skills.</TE>
<TE>   Local participants have been preparing their arguments, testimony
and strategies since October with the help of volunteer attorney
coaches, many of whom attended this week's event with the wrinkled
brows of nervous stage mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "So often all we hear about are the negative things about
teenagers, but when you come here and participate, you get to see the
positive side of young kids who work and sacrifice and come together
as a team," said Larry Levine, a civil attorney who helps coach the
La Reina team. "It's soul food."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the team competition, students vied for individual
awards in categories ranging from best prosecutor and best courtroom
artist to best witness and best defense attorney. His unflappable
performance as a district attorney earned Matt Lee, a Newbury Park
High School sophomore, the Outstanding Prosecutor title. But after he
accepted his trophy from Ventura County Schools Supt. Chuck Weis, the
15-year-old was trembling with joy.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed all of it, but especially at the end of the case, just
being able to discuss the evidence and the judge's rulings with the
other teams," said Matt, who, like many of the competitors, hopes to
pursue a legal career.</TE>
<TE>   This year's make-believe case, "People vs. Price," involved such
current issues as eco-terrorism and criminal profiling. The
make-believe defendant was a community college student accused of
setting fire to a ski lodge based on circumstantial evidence that
police seized from her truck and house.</TE>

<HD>Jury Convicts O.C. Teacher in Molestations</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former fourth-grade instructor is found guilty
of classroom attacks on boys at two schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County jury Wednesday convicted a former teacher of
molesting students in his classrooms in two county districts where he
taught fourth grade.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Abhyankar, 28, was found guilty of nine felony child
molestation counts involving three boys, two at Village View
Elementary in the Ocean View School District and one at Portola Hills
Elementary School in the Saddleback Valley Unified district.</LD>
<LD>   He faces a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison when he is
sentenced March 8, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Matt Murphy.</LD>
<TE>   "Happy doesn't even begin to describe it," said Kris Ekberg, whose
son was molested by Abhyankar when he taught at Village View
Elementary in Huntington Beach. "We're talking two years of not
sleeping because we were so upset."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Schreiber, Abhyankar's attorney, said he will recommend
that his client appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think the verdict was supported by the evidence? No,"
Schreiber said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the jury took less than a day to convict Abhyankar.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Carla Singer took the unusual step of
ordering the former teacher, who had been free on $150,000 bail,
taken into custody Monday after closing arguments. She said the
evidence against him was overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury did the right thing," Murphy said. "The defendant
violated a sacred trust and these little boys have waited a long time
for justice."</TE>
<TE>   In his closing arguments, Murphy also criticized the conduct of
officials in the Ocean View School District, where Abhyankar taught
from 1997 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Ekberg and the parents of two other children molested by Abhyankar
have filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the Huntington Beach
school system. They contend that officials wrote a letter of
recommendation for the teacher even though they suspected him of
acting inappropriately around his students. Abhyankar subsequently
was hired to teach at Portola Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials began investigating Abhyankar in January 2000,
after a Portola Hills student said his teacher had touched him
inappropriately. After looking into those allegations, authorities
interviewed Abhyankar's former students in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   They ultimately charged the teacher with molesting two students
from Huntington Beach and two from south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The jury said there was not enough evidence to convict Abhyankar
of molesting the fourth boy, whom prosecutors said was touched over
his clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The three other boys were the victims of more serious violations,
the prosecutor said. One child was orally copulated during lunchtime
behind a locked classroom door. Another was fondled at the teacher's
desk during lunch. A third was touched in front of a classroom full
of students.</TE>
<TE>   "He took advantage of his position to satisfy his own sexual
desires," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Jury foreman Aaron Spencer said the jurors thought Ocean View
should not have written a recommendation for the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the civil case, officials in the Ocean View district
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The world needs to hear that these bad people exist," Ekberg
said. "This will open people's eyes so this doesn't happen again."</TE>

<HD>Key Vote Nears on Eastside Rail Line</HD>
<DH>Transit: The MTA board is expected to approve a crucial
environmental report on the proposed route today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents on the Eastside of Los Angeles have long craved a commuter
rail line to connect them with downtown. They are likely to clear a
major hurdle today when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
expected to approve a crucial environmental study for the project.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly a decade of struggle, engineers have designed a route
to satisfy MTA board members' concerns. Nearly half a billion dollars
have been set aside. And key political leaders have been brought into
the fold.</LD>
<LD>   Yet years of longing and significant support have not eliminated a
determined and vocal opposition that is again raising its voice
against the project. The critics distrust the MTA and say the planned
five-year construction will shutter businesses, force families to
flee and threaten two major neighborhood institutions--an indoor
sales mart known as El Mercado and a high school for troubled teenage
girls.</LD>
<TE>   The critics know they are fighting massive support for the rail
line, which would link the Eastside to downtown, where a connection
will extend to Pasadena. But they say they will never give up the
fight, whether it means filing lawsuits or even physically blocking
construction of the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, they may be joined by members of the Bus Riders
Union. The advocacy group is renewing its oft-repeated complaint: MTA
rail projects siphon off money that should be spent to buy buses and
relieve severe overcrowding for bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-member board will vote today on an environmental study that
lays out the design and path of the $760-million Eastside line, along
with the location of nine new stations.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the plan would be forwarded to Washington, where the
Federal Transit Administration has for years designated $495 million
for construction of the railway. State money will cover the remaining
cost.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which hopes to break ground next year, is proceeding
with a sense of urgency. MTA officials fear that delays may cost them
federal and state funding pledges--meaning that the Eastside might
never get its railway.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-inch-thick environmental plan is a slight revision of a
blueprint submitted to the board last year. Worried at the time about
the location of some train stations, board members told MTA planners
to make alterations. They spent the last several months fine-tuning
the route, with input from Eastside residents and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the railway will be an extension of the 13-mile-long
Pasadena Gold Line, due for completion in summer 2003. That would
mean riders boarding in Pasadena could loop through downtown and,
without transferring, end up in some of Los Angeles' oldest,
predominantly Latino neighborhoods. Along the way the "Eastside
extension" would pass through Little Tokyo, cross the Los Angeles
River and continue to Boyle Heights, before ending in unincorporated
East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The train would travel for just over a mile underneath Boyle
Heights, to keep commuter trains off the narrow, dense streets.</TE>
<TE>   The countywide transit agency sees the Eastside line as crucial to
its plans to spread light rail throughout the region. The
neighborhoods east of downtown are among the region's poorest and
their residents rely heavily on public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers on the new train could speed through the eastern
extension in 17 minutes, significantly faster than buses that require
multiple transfers and often get caught in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by scores of interviews conducted on the streets of Boyle
Heights recently, the plan appears to be heartily endorsed by most
residents. "We feel like a very strong solution was come up with and
like people in the community were very involved," said longtime Boyle
Heights resident Nadine Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   But at recent community meetings, MTA planners tried to spell out
their plans, only to be shouted down by critics. "As more and more
people hear about the new plan, there's a growing sense of anger on
the streets," said Arturo Chayra, who has started a petition drive
against the project.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the anger springs from a general distrust of all things
MTA. Those feelings were fueled by promises made a decade ago, when
the agency told residents it would build a subway to the area.</TE>
<TE>   Families were relocated and businesses torn down to make way for
the construction. But as the agency struggled with cost overruns and
construction mishaps on other projects, MTA board member and Los
Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky sponsored a winning ballot
measure that essentially scrapped the Eastside subway.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of empty, bulldozed acres pockmark Boyle Heights today.</TE>
<TE>   "They can come up with all the fancy plans that they want," said
resident Ernestina Montellano. "I don't believe a word they say. Why
should I? They've never lived up to their words in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most contentious wrangling on the proposal involves
the neighborhood in Boyle Heights where the tracks would one day
emerge from a 1.3-mile-long tunnel. A neighborhood of small homes and
low-slung businesses lies alongside the three-story El Mercado: a
bustling shopping center of dozens of small businesses that sell
everything from sugary churros to videotapes to votive candles.</TE>
<TE>   Though extremely popular, especially with new immigrants from
Mexico, the 34-year-old market is dilapidated and attracts an
unsavory, unsafe crowd, some say.</TE>
<TE>   In positioning the rail line near El Mercado, the MTA has embedded
itself in the heated neighborhood debate about the market.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's plan moves a rail station two blocks from the market.
The original proposal, to put the train station next to El Mercado,
was deemed unsafe by planners. They said that there would not be
enough room for firetrucks to maneuver and that visibility would be
poor for drivers.</TE>
<TE>   But moving the station two blocks away does not sit well with El
Mercado owner Pedro Rosado. He complains that riders won't walk the
two blocks to his business and that the route blocks access to
parking at the rear of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Among Rosado's influential community backers is Los Angeles City
Councilman Nick Pacheco. But on the streets of Boyle Heights, many
people say they couldn't care less about the details; they just long
for "el tren."</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope the MTA does not listen to that man," said Vicky
Macias, the owner of a mini-mall across the street from El Mercado.
"The rail line is only going to make things better for business here.
We've waited long enough for something big to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents have a powerful ally in Los Angeles County Supervisor
Gloria Molina, who sits on the MTA board. Molina's support of the
project virtually ensures that the board will approve the study, say
those who follow the agency's politics closely.</TE>
<TE>   But, like every attempt to bring rail service to Los Angeles,
solutions tend to beget problems. The safety-driven decision to move
away from El Mercado pushes the rail station next to Ramona High
School.</TE>
<TE>   The small Los Angeles Unified School District campus serves about
150 troubled girls, many of them young mothers whose toddlers attend
day care at the school.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials worry that the rail line would be a
distraction and safety hazard because it could send trains rumbling
within 40 yards of classrooms. They want the school moved if the rail
line goes in--at a cost of just over $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials say they have struggled too long to let the school
issue derail their plans.</TE>
<TE>   They say they will either keep Ramona High where it is and remodel
the school, to make the buildings taller and more compact, or they
will rebuild the school a few blocks away at the site of an abandoned
supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "After all this time," promised Molina, "we are finally going to
build something."</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda OKs $10-Million Expansion of Nixon Library</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yorba Linda officials approved plans Wednesday night for a
$10-million expansion that will nearly double the size of the Richard
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace.</LD>
<LD>   The privately funded, 47,300-square-foot expansion will include a
replica of the White House East Room, site of the wedding reception
of Nixon's daughter Patricia, one of the few times during his
administration that he hit the dance floor.</LD>
<LD>   The Yorba Linda Planning Commission approved the plan in a 5-0
vote, giving the go-ahead to a summer groundbreaking on the yearlong
project.</LD>
<TE>   The expansion will make the building the fifth largest
presidential library in the country. Although the library will also
add an exhibit hall, catering facilities, administrative offices and
an entrance pavilion, the East Room replica--with detail down to the
Steinway piano--will be the project's highlight.</TE>
<TE>   "For our visitors, seeing the East Room will be an 'Aha' moment,"
said John Taylor, executive director of the Nixon Foundation. "It
will help bring alive for people a part of the White House that they
might have seen only on television."</TE>
<TE>   The East Room, considered the White House "public audience room,"
has long hosted famous performers, including pianist Van Cliburn,
jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie and violinist Isaac Stern.</TE>
<TE>   In Yorba Linda, the East Room will also be offered up for
weddings, bar mitzvahs and Boy Scout ceremonies--the types of
activities that, according to Taylor, already account for 10% of the
library's $4.7-million annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   The library is Yorba Linda's biggest draw, with about 147,000
visitors last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's truly an asset to this community," said Donald Winn Jr.,
executive director of the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce. "It helps
to keep the restaurants a little busier and our local hotel a little
busier."</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon library is the only privately owned and operated
presidential library. The other 10 libraries, with an 11th planned
for Bill Clinton, are run by the National Archives, which house the
presidential papers.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon's papers are not at the library, despite a lengthy legal
custody battle with the federal government. Even so, Taylor said, the
library contains an extensive collection of Nixon history and
memorabilia.</TE>

<HD>NOW Steps Into 40th District Fracas</HD>
<DH>Politics: Valley chapter, angered by Cherny abortion
mailer, backs Levine for Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH and SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abortion, racism and theft became issues Wednesday in the 40th
Assembly District race, a tight, heated contest between two San
Fernando Valley Democrats who support reproductive rights for women.</LD>
<LD>   Incensed by a mailer that suggests candidate Lloyd Levine is
anti-abortion, a San Fernando Valley chapter of the National
Organization for Women endorsed Levine on Wednesday over opponent
Andrei Cherny. The NOW chapter had remained neutral in the race
because it considered both Democrats to be allies.</LD>
<LD>   The Cherny flier that questioned Levine's credentials on women's
rights is "just absolutely absurd, and it's really dirty politics,"
said Jan Tucker, spokeswoman for NOW's San Fernando Valley/Northeast
Los Angeles chapter.</LD>
<TE>   Levine has been rated "100% pro-choice" by the California Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League and Planned Parenthood, Tucker
said at a news conference at Levine's Van Nuys office.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer from Cherny implied that Levine opposed women's
reproductive rights because he once worked for an assemblyman who
"tried to stop" a bill requiring California health insurers to cover
contraception for women.</TE>
<TE>   The legislator, now-state Sen. Edward Vincent (D-Inglewood), said
Wednesday he supported the bill on one vote but that he was absent
when it came up for another vote.</TE>
<TE>   Cherny's mailer, Vincent said, is "not misconception. It's
outright lies."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent said Levine wasn't working for him when the bill came up
in 1999--he was working for Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto),
one of the bill's sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, [I] don't have a defense for that," Cherny campaign
strategist Rick Taylor said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Levine's campaign also accused Cherny's side of scaring Valley
voters by alluding to Vincent as being from "South-Central Los
Angeles." The label "South-Central" is racist and connotes a
crime-ridden area, Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor accused Levine of racism.</TE>
<TE>   "'South-Central' is not a derogatory word unless you're a racist,"
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor also stood behind another flier picturing Levine next to a
tattooed gangster with a gun. "Lloyd Levine cares more about
criminals than our families," it reads.</TE>
<TE>   The flier was leaked Tuesday night--before it was mailed, Taylor
said--which led Cherny's campaign to accuse Levine's side of stealing
it from the Van Nuys mailing firm they both use.</TE>
<TE>   Levine is "a thief and he knows it, and he'd better come forward,"
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Cherny and Levine, both first-time candidates, know Tuesday's
Democratic primary will almost certainly determine the 40th
District's next assemblyman. Because Democrats outnumber Republicans
49% to 31% in the southwestern Valley district, the Republican in the
race, businesswoman Connie Friedman, is a longshot.</TE>

<HD>City Planners Advise Against Oakmont</HD>
<DH>Development: Glendale council decides the project's fate
next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendale's Planning Division recommended Wednesday night that the
City Council reject Oakmont View V, a development of 572 luxury homes
in the Verdugo Mountains above the Oakmont Country Club.</LD>
<LD>   City senior planner Laura Stotler dissected a 24-page report
before hundreds of environmentalists, homeowners and developers who
packed the Glendale Civic Auditorium for a final public hearing on
the controversial project before the council votes on its fate next
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report presented to the city Planning Commission found the
238-acre development is "inconsistent with the city's General Plan"
and "poses a significant public safety hazard."</LD>
<TE>   As Oakmont opponents applauded the report, Stotler said building
homes on the steep, rocky slopes could result in landslides or
rockslides, potentially causing the loss of life and property.</TE>
<TE>   "The site is not physically suitable," Stotler said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also found the Oakmont proposal would pose "substantial
environmental danger" to the area's oak and sycamore trees, acorn
woodpeckers, deer and endangered wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   It also would harm a wetland habitat of "special-status plants and
animals," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   A four-volume, 2,000-page environmental impact report released
last week concluded that Oakmont would harm the air, wildlife and
scenic vistas but would not significantly increase Glendale's
population or require building community facilities to accommodate
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont developer John L. Gregg called the report "misleading,"
particularly the section warning about building on slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone ever got killed by the failure of engineered cut slopes
in the city of Glendale, I would know about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His family has built in the area since 1934, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg also said the project's benefits, including tax revenue for
the city and more housing, outweigh the negatives. "The hills are the
only land left," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Oakmont opponents, who spoke late into the night,
praised the city's report. "It provides overwhelming evidence that
the project should be denied," said Marc Stirdivant, who heads
Glendale's Volunteers Organized in Conserving the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   "In my estimation, there is not anything good about Oakmont," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed federal legislation calls for a study of expanding the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the
Verdugos. It would allow the Oakmont land to be used as recreational
space.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved $8 million toward the purchase of
the Oakmont tract. But the land was appraised at $46 million more
than a decade ago, Gregg said.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg said his company, Gregg's Artistic Homes, proposed the
project in 1992, a year before Glendale adopted a law that would have
limited the number of hillside homes to about 50. Gregg sued the
city, then agreed to drop the lawsuit if officials allowed the
proposal to proceed under the earlier, less restrictive ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that his company has spent more than $3.25 million on
environmental impact reports, legal fees, geological studies,
biological studies, engineering work and other expenses related to
the Oakmont proposal.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Adopts Controversial Plan to Reduce School Busing</HD>
<DH>Education: District hopes to lure back private school
students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pasadena school board early Wednesday approved an initiative that
will redraw school attendance zones to reduce busing and create more
neighborhood schools.</LD>
<LD>   After several months of public meetings, focus groups and board work
sessions, Supt. Percy Clark's initiative had evolved and expanded to
include reopening a closed campus to accommodate elementary and middle
school students; creating a math and sciences magnet at one middle school;
building a new elementary school in the northwest section of the district;
and drawing new attendance zone maps.</LD>
<LD>   The plan will take effect next fall, reducing the number of
students being bused from the northwest section from 2,300 to between
1,300 and 1,600. Busing, which was launched to end segregation,
eventually will be phased out completely under the district's plan.</LD>
<TE>   The district hopes the plan will help attract back to the schools
some of the 10,000 area children who now attend private schools.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the plan around 12:30 Wednesday morning, after
two hours of public comment and two hours of debate.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the school board's concerns about the plan came from
Esteban Lizardo, the only member to vote against it. He expressed
concern that the district is placing too much emphasis on attracting
new students and not doing enough for the mostly minority students in
the densely populated northwest area. Those students make up about
half of the district's 23,500-student population.</TE>
<TE>   "What does this plan do for the kids most deeply impacted by [the
school board's] lack of action for the last 32 years?" Lizardo asked.
But his concerns were not enough to sway other members of the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of us have reservations, but either we go on this or we
don't," said Mike Babcock, vice president of the board. "At the end of
the day, it comes down to this: [Supt. Clark] is a professional. We hired
him and this is what he thinks we should do. I support it."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock, Tommy McMullins, Susan Kane, Peter Soelter and Ed
Honowitz voted for the initiative. Lizardo was the only member in
opposition and one board member, Jacqueline Jacobs, abstained.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative has been controversial in some communities because of
fears that neighborhood schools would resegregate the district. Many
parents also are concerned about parity in the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to ride into Pasadena and take
a look at schools in the east and look at schools in the west and see
inequities there," Jacobs said. "The word 'neighborhood' scares a lot
of people. They're looking around at their neighborhood and that's
why they're worried about resegregation."</TE>
<TE>   Busing was launched in the Pasadena Unified School District in 1970
in an effort to create racially integrated schools.</TE>
<TE>   Clark has emphasized in the past that he will keep diversity in
the district by offering choice and magnet programs. At Tuesday
night's meeting, he said that distributing resources and qualified
teachers unequally would not help the district achieve its goals.</TE>
<TE>   Lizardo and some parents have questioned the district's commitment
to building the new elementary school and whether the money to do so
will be available.</TE>
<TE>   However, about half the speakers at the board meeting--ranging
from parents to the president of the Pasadena NAACP--endorsed the
superintendent's plan.</TE>

<HD>Compton's Bradley Seeks Court's  Intervention</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton Mayor Omar Bradley, scheduled by court order to be replaced
today by the man who beat him in a disputed city election, on
Wednesday sought emergency intervention by the state Supreme Court to
keep him in office.</LD>
<LD>   In his petition for review, Bradley asked the state's highest
court to act by 4 p.m. today to prevent Eric Perrodin from reclaiming
the mayor's post, arguing that such a move would cause Compton voters
and Bradley irreparable harm.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court could act on Bradley's request but also could
decline to hear it, said his attorney, Bradley W. Hertz.</LD>
<TE>   "But given the high-profile nature of the case," Hertz said, and
the questions raised in this week's dueling legal briefs, "I think
the court is aware of what is at stake and . . . might be interested
and concerned" about the issues.</TE>
<TE>   News of Bradley's midafternoon appeal threw Compton into further
turmoil and suspense: Who would be mayor today?</TE>
<TE>   It was a reasonable question.</TE>
<TE>   A block from City Hall, Eddie Williams sat selling bus tokens
Wednesday. The mere sight of the Civic Center and its dueling mayors
and administrators, he said, makes him dizzy.</TE>
<TE>   "One day they're in, one day they're out," said Williams. "In and
out, in and out. Man, what's going on?"</TE>
<TE>   That question echoed around Compton one day after an appeals court
blocked a Superior Court judge's ruling, which had ousted Perrodin,
elected in June, from office and returned two-time incumbent Bradley
to power.</TE>
<TE>   The decision plunged Compton into yet another state of chaos. Now,
aside from the switch in the mayor's office, the city will have two
city managers and two assistant city managers.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, after the appellate ruling favoring Perrodin, the
pro-Bradley City Council approved paying $840,000 of Bradley's legal
fees, as well as $43,000 in back wages.</TE>
<TE>   One question tossed around town Wednesday was whether the council
will try to reverse that action when Perrodin resumes
office--provided that the Supreme Court does not intervene on
Bradley's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents flatly opposed the payments. "Today I am saddened
to see the City Council and how you voted," Gladys Russell, 75, told
the council. "God is all over you.... I wish no bad on you, but it's
coming."</TE>
<TE>   In this city of 93,000, where civic engagement is often avid,
residents were desperately searching Wednesday for something of which
to be proud. Some of the beleaguered citizens even waxed nostalgic
about Compton's recent, infamous, past.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember when the only time people ever talked about Compton was
to talk about gangs or shootings?" said 25-year-old Elena Torrez to
her brother Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he replied. "Those were the days."</TE>
<TE>   The Torrez siblings were like many residents who knew few details
about the battle for City Hall--but enough to feel frustration and
embarrassment, and a sense that the city is rudderless at a time when
crime and unemployment remain serious problems.</TE>
<TE>   Thieves have stolen Lisa Perry's car and burglarized her
house--they even snatched baby food from the freezer--so she's soon
moving out of the city. With all the political commotion going on,
she doesn't think things will improve any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "What they need to do is get the drug dealers and gangsters out of
Compton," said Perry. "I never had this problem in other places I've
lived."</TE>
<TE>   For some, a sense of hopelessness has set in. "There's nothing we
can do but watch," said Manuel Richard, a 17-year resident.</TE>
<TE>   The disaffection has given rise to conspiracy theories.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the token seller, wonders why the appeals court heard
Perrodin's matter so quickly, when he had to wait years for his
appeal on a burglary conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me two years to get an appeal," said Williams. "I guess
you can do these things when you're a district attorney."</TE>
<TE>   That reference to Perrodin, a deputy district attorney, is a
frequent refrain among Bradley supporters. In a stunning upset, the
mayor was narrowly defeated by Perrodin in June's election. Bradley
sued the city, Perrodin and City Clerk Charles Davis, alleging
election fraud that led to his defeat.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 8, a Superior Court judge found that city officials had
illegally placed Perrodin's name before Bradley's on the ballot--just
as it had been on the primary ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Citing testimony about the statistical advantage Perrodin
allegedly had gained by the ballot order, the judge ousted Perrodin
and another elected council member. She ordered Bradley sworn in as
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   But now the appellate decision has changed the civic
order--again--and Perrodin's attorney saw some value to the seesaw
battle.</TE>
<TE>   "The one good thing to have come from the Superior Court decision
is that it has energized a portion of the population to know that
they have to watch carefully what goes on in their government--and
that the courts are available to redress wrongs that occur," said
attorney Fred Woocher.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents said Wednesday that they no longer care whether
Perrodin or Bradley prevails. They just want it over.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good when you turn the leadership over every
other day on the strength of the court, not the strength of the
people," said Lenon Tolbert, 71, a barber. "We deserve better. We
need some stable government."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said they believe that the political chaos of City
Hall is preventing officials from fixing problems the community
already had.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed," said Ethel Gatus, 64, a retired nurse
doing her daily shopping. "I've been in Compton since 1965, and I've
seen this place go down.... [City officials] are not on their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Some City Hall employees would agree.</TE>
<TE>   Although many workers said that they were going about their daily
jobs and that parking tickets still needed to be paid and gas bills
collected, tension seemed to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday how the business of Compton government was
functioning, one City Hall worker said, "Barely."</TE>
<TE>   City Clerk Davis had already been interviewed by three TV stations
before lunch, but said his office was coping under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning we had a staff meeting like we normally do after
council meetings," Davis said. "We're going about our business--oh,
the dude from Channel 7 is here--we're doing what needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Nancy Wride and Jose Cardenas contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Council OKs Revised Deal to Protect Plateau</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Developers can build nearly 400 residences
in exchange for preserving 191 acres of open space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks City Council members have called a truce in their
bitter dispute over a politically sensitive land deal with
developers, approving a plan that will preserve 191 acres of open
space called the Western Plateau.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote came shortly after midnight Wednesday,
following a six-hour hearing attended by about 150 people.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Linda Parks and Mayor Ed Masry, who earlier had
characterized the deal as legally shaky and a giveaway to developers,
signed on after some last-minute concessions that eased their
concerns. "Now I can support it 100%--it's a far better deal," Parks
said after her vote.</LD>
<TE>   As modified, the agreement between the city and a consortium of
three developers, Shapell Industries, Miller Bros. and Operating
Engineers Pension Trust, does the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Permanently protects the plateau near Hill Canyon by turning
control over to the city.</TE>
<TE>   * Provides about six acres in the upscale Dos Vientos Ranch
development for a middle school and a YMCA with child care.</TE>
<TE>   * Releases developers from a commitment to build 225 affordable
and senior housing units in Dos Vientos. Instead, the builders may
erect 299 full-price condos and apartments and 95 additional
homes--worth millions of dollars more--in the Dos Vientos and Rancho
Conejo neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   * Requires developers to build 120 affordable and senior
apartments on a site elsewhere in the city, to be determined later
this year. This agreement was reached only days ago and helped sway
Masry and Parks.</TE>
<TE>   * Takes out of the agreement Site I, an 8.7-acre parcel that Parks
and Masry argued could not be developed without a vote by city
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The council gave separate approval to that site in a 3-1 vote,
declining to put the issue on the ballot. Masry objected and Parks
abstained from the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Developers have proposed building three luxury homes on the 8.7
acres; in return, they would give $2.5 million for a $3.4-million
public equestrian center nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city say developing Site I does not require public
approval under the city's parks ordinance. But slow-growth lawyer
Richard Francis disagrees and has threatened a lawsuit to force the
measure onto the ballot. By separating that site from the Western
Plateau deal, city officials believe the majority of the deal is
protected from such a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Should a judge later require public approval, voters would
essentially be asked to choose between a public equestrian center or
keeping 8.7 acres from being developed.</TE>
<TE>   Of about three dozen public speakers at the Tuesday night hearing,
many praised the Western Plateau deal, while others remained
convinced the deal is a giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that Shapell Industries, which has owned the Western
Plateau for decades, never would have developed it because building
roads and grading hillsides across the plateau would be too
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear that Wednesday's vote represented a compromise, but
not a peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes Linda Parks just can't see the forest for the trees,"
Councilman Dan Del Campo quipped later. "I'm just happy that she
arrived at the conclusion that this was something that was beneficial
to the entire community."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she still believes Site I should be put to the voters.
"Let the people decide. It sure beats getting sued."</TE>

<HD>Quake Forecast System Offered</HD>
<DH>Seismology: Colorado researchers say patterns of small
temblors may indicate where big ones are likely to hit. Local
scientists, however, have doubts about theory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>University of Colorado scientists say they may have found a way to
forecast Southern California earthquakes--but that the method cannot
be verified until the end of the decade.</LD>
<LD>   The system, developed primarily by John B. Rundle and Kristy F.
Tiampo of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in
Environmental Sciences, uses past patterns of small quakes to
evaluate which areas are most likely to have quakes of 5.0 magnitude
or larger.</LD>
<LD>   The scientists have provided a color-coded map showing areas where
the bigger quakes may occur through 2010.</LD>
<TE>   But three local earthquake scientists--David Jackson of UCLA,
Egill Hauksson of Caltech and Lucy Jones of the U.S. Geological
Survey--cautioned that they believe the system is subject to
considerable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle acknowledged that success is far from certain, but said the
map, produced by a team including scientists at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, will
let researchers test the theory.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a great deal of skepticism about this, and
there should be," Rundle said. "We don't know whether it will work or
not."</TE>
<TE>   The map was developed early last year, but not released until
publication in an article that appeared Feb. 19 in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year there have been two quakes of 5.1 or larger in
Southern California. One, near Big Bear Lake on Feb. 10, 2001, was
inside an area marked as susceptible to large quakes. Another, near
Anza last Oct. 31, was about 10 miles outside one. A third quake, the
5.7 that occurred last Friday 30 miles inside Baja California, was
within another area designated as susceptible.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones said Friday that "one year and three events is not
enough to say" whether Rundle and Tiampo's system works.</TE>
<TE>   Jones noted that most of the areas marked as being at risk on the
Colorado scientists' map are in the state's most active seismic areas
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest patches of predicted activity are in the northern San
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, the Mammoth Lakes area and the
Mojave Desert areas, all of which have had many small quakes and some
large ones in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "To determine the success of the method, it will be necessary to
look at what earthquakes occur within these regions over the next 10
years and to determine what is the chance that they would have
happened anyway," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said the new system provides only a forecast--a general
statement of the probability of quakes, without specifying an exact
time, place and size--and therefore not a quake prediction. Few
scientists believe it is presently possible to precisely predict when
and where an earthquake will occur.</TE>
<TE>   To UCLA's Jackson, however, the Colorado scientists' system does
not even qualify as a forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no probabilities, so it is not what most seismologists
call a forecast," Jackson said. "It's not clear that their
complicated physics adds much beyond what we already know from the
locations of past earthquakes."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said it is important to differentiate between forecasting
earthquakes, predicting them and simply estimating hazards for an
area. Earthquake hazard estimations, he said, describe the long-term
earthquake potential for an area based on past earthquake activity.
That, he said, is what he believes Rundle and his colleagues have
done.</TE>

<DH>Ordeal: Publicity about a couple's extraordinary medical
drama brings the husband's sister back into his life after a 20-year
separation.</DH>

<LD>Benita Prado Bocanegra was at her Los Angeles home Tuesday night when
an image from her fuzzy television caught her attention. She, like
other Angelenos, was amazed by the story of the reclusive couple who
underwent separate but simultaneous medical ordeals.</LD>
<LD>   She listened to the story of the wheelchair-dependent woman who
was trapped between her bed and a wall, while her husband, the only
person who would know if she was in trouble, lay unconscious in a
hospital. Bocanegra, 77, heard the man's last name, Prado, but did
not realize it was her brother, Agustin, whom she had not seen in
more than 20 years. Luckily, other family members did and on
Wednesday Prado Bocanegra visited her long-lost brother in the
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't sleep last night thinking about finally seeing him,"
Prado Bocanegra said. "I told him to please let us into his life. I
told him he's not alone. There are so many people who care for him."</LD>
<TE>   Her brother, Agustin Prado, 58, had driven himself to the hospital
on Feb. 16. He was vomiting profusely and in extreme pain. Emergency
room doctors rushed him into surgery to repair a ruptured esophagus;
a rare, life-threatening condition. His wife of 39 years, Amparo, 64,
took a taxi home. Before she left for their Highland Park home,
Agustin promised to return home by last Wednesday to drive her to her
next dialysis treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after Amparo returned to their Highland Park home, she
fell. No one knew she was alone except Agustin, who was hooked up to
a ventilator, heavily sedated and unconscious as Amparo screamed for
help in vain. When he finally was able to speak nine days later, he
alerted doctors. Police found Amparo, weak but alive.</TE>
<TE>   Prado Bocanegra said Agustin was always the most reclusive of the
five brothers and sisters. He moved to Highland Park and never made
an effort to see the family, Prado Bocanegra said. There was no ill
will between Agustin and the family; they just slowly grew apart and
stopped seeing one another, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much he's missed all these years," Prado said. "There
is so much I want to sit down and talk to him about."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center said the
husband and wife are expected to recover but will remain in the
hospital for more monitoring and testing. "We expect them to be all
right, but these are two very sick people. It's going to be a long
recovery process."</TE>
<TE>   Agustin became ill when the contents of his esophagus spread to
his lungs and to the areas around his heart, said Thomas Godfrey,
medical director at the medical center. Because Agustin cannot take
deep breaths and has had difficulty breathing, he is wearing an
oxygen mask.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people who have what he has don't make it," Godfrey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Amparo's condition was improving. She had
missed several dialysis appointments and doctors had administered
treatment on Tuesday, Godfrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said it is a mystery how Amparo survived without food and
water for so long, but through different medical tests have
determined that she may not have been wedged between the wall and her
bed for as long as previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   They said they have not determined how many days the woman
actually went without basic necessities.</TE>
<TE>   "All we know is she seems to have reached for some hairpins and
that's the last thing she remembers," Godfrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Agustin's sister said she can care for her younger brother after
he is released from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them that I'd cook for them and help them however
possible, even if I have to drag my sick little feet," said Prado
Bocanegra, who suffers from osteoporosis and arthritis. "I hope he
accepts my offer. It's so sad to be so distant from family."</TE>
<TE>   Amparo was moved from Kaiser's West Los Angeles Medical Center
late Wednesday to the Los Angeles Medical Center on Sunset Boulevard,
where she and her husband will again sleep side by side.</TE>
<TE>   The only bed available for her at the hospital was the one next to
her husband, doctors said. "Ironically, the hospital is very full,
but the only open bed is the one in his room," Godfrey said. "We had
nothing to do with that. This is fate."</TE>

<HD>Tax Revenues for New Valley City Overstated by $31 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consultant for the commission studying San Fernando Valley
secession said Wednesday that a breakaway city would have about $31
million less in annual tax revenues than originally estimated.</LD>
<LD>   The reduction would amount to 3% of a Valley city's $1-billion
budget. Keith Curry, the consultant to the Local Agency Formation
Commission, said the projected revenues were rolled back because of
obscure state laws governing taxes on property transfers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a significant blow, but it's not devastating," said Curry,
who is managing director of Public Financial Management of Newport
Beach. "It's big to you and me, but it's not the whole world."</LD>
<TE>   To make up for the loss, Curry said, a new city could seek
legislation that would allow it to collect more money for the
property transfers. It could also reduce services or take other steps
to cut costs or increase income, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles collects $4.50 for every $1,000 worth of real estate
sold in the city. But a new Valley city, which would be organized
under a different set of state laws, would receive 55 cents for each
$1,000 of real estate sold.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Levine, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One Los
Angeles, said the paper loss of $30.9 million in Valley revenues
would prevent a new city from providing services equivalent to those
now offered by Los Angeles. He also said a Valley city might default
on its financial obligations.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeff Brain, president of the secessionist group Valley VOTE,
said the proposed budget for a new city already takes into account
the $30.9-million loss.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO will decide this spring whether to put secession to a
citywide vote in November.</TE>

<HD>Fountain Is Liquid Peace in Busy Downtown</HD>
<DH>The Watercourt at California Plaza and its
computer-controlled display delight and soothe during summer concerts
and as diners enjoy a quiet lunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No dry run was necessary when the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra
performed last summer on the city's most unusual stage.</LD>
<LD>   The orchestra chose Handel's "Water Music," an appropriate score
for an outdoor theater built against a backdrop of 146 dancing
fountains.</LD>
<LD>   It was a typical mix of civility and excitement at the
Watercourt--a place that for a decade has used flowing water to
produce a continuous blend of solitude and stimulation.</LD>
<TE>   The amphitheater at California Plaza in downtown Los Angeles
doesn't need musicians on its granite performance stage to stir the
soul, however.</TE>
<TE>   Computerized fountain jets dominate a 1 1/2-acre garden courtyard
framed by high-rise buildings between Grand Avenue and Olive Street.
Geysers that spurt 40 feet high are punctuated by surging waves that
cascade into a pond that wraps around flower-filled islands and an
open dining area.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Bunker Hill-area office workers spend their weekday
lunch hours at the courtyard. Thousands turn out for weekly
summertime concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so relaxing to watch the water. It changes constantly, with
it shooting into the air and then cascading down in a waterfall. And
the summer shows bring a lot of people downtown who wouldn't normally
be here," said Michael Kruse, a steel company executive whose office
is on the 52nd floor of a nearby tower.</TE>
<TE>   Kruse, of Long Beach, visits the Watercourt as often as three
times a week. His favorite spot is above the fountains, where a sunny
walkway overlooks the geysers and downtown streets below Angel's
Flight. The whoosh of powerful water jets and the soft gurgle of
smaller nozzles combine to drown out the noise of city traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The multilevel Watercourt is an engineering marvel.</TE>
<TE>   The fountain and pond are cantilevered over Olive Street. So, any
leaks will empty onto the roadway instead of into California Plaza's
deep underground parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   But for 10 years the fountain system has remained watertight, say
engineers who oversee the $17-million installation.</TE>
<TE>   The fountain uses 90,000 gallons of water. Compressed air blasted
through 76 "micro-shooter" nozzles hidden in the top stage level
sends geysers of varying heights into the air. Behind them are 40
"volume jets" that create what Patrick Saito calls a "curtain
wall"--a continuously flowing backdrop to the spurts of water.</TE>
<TE>   Every 14 minutes, other nozzles release 30,000 gallons from the
back of the geyser fountain platform. That creates a wave that gushes
across the lower-level concert stage before cascading into the pond,
said Saito, an assistant chief engineer at California Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The irregularly shaped pond is only ankle-deep. But its black
bottom makes it look deeper to those dining in adjoining patio areas
or relaxing on amphitheater seats made of granite cut in Great
Britain and Canada and polished in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Saito said two 50-horsepower pumps move water from a reservoir
tucked beneath the dining patio to the top of the fountain. There, a
15-horsepower air compressor runs the geysers and water curtain
nozzles.</TE>
<TE>   "The micro-shooters are like little bazookas. Chambers of water
are pressurized, and a computer controls the height that the water is
released," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company that designed the Watercourt system later created the
water displays at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. That firm is now
out of business, although minor valve repairs are easy to make. Major
maintenance on piping and pumps is performed by a San Fernando Valley
company, Saito said.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain maintenance--along with the cost of replenishing the 800
gallons lost to evaporation on a typical hot summer day--costs about
$100,000 a year. A nonprofit organization called Grand Performances
pays for the upkeep with money contributed by the three major
California Plaza property owners: Equity Office Properties,
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Omni Los Angeles Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Performances also stages the summer concert series that
offers an eclectic mix of local and internationally known artists. An
evening rumba and mambo performance by the 12-member rhythmic
ensemble Cubanismo! a few years ago drew a Watercourt crowd of more
than 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to give people something to chew on--to have a taste of a
performing arts form they might normally not buy a ticket for," said
Leigh Ann Hahn, director of programming for Grand Performances.</TE>
<TE>   Tentative plans call for this year's shows to begin in June with a
performance by salsa star Johnny Polanco y Su Conjunto Amistad, she
said. Lunchtime shows begin at noon Fridays; evening performances are
at 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. They are free.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions cover about half of the annual $1.3-million cost of
the shows, said Michael Alexander, executive director of Grand
Performances. Sponsorships, along with red buckets that are passed
through concert crowds for donations, pay for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Concert planners say they have learned much about the coordination
of fountains and concerts since the first Watercourt show was held in
October 1992. During the premiere, musicians with the Poncho Sanchez
band were nervous about electrocution. They unplugged their
microphones and amplifiers and hurried off the stage before the
fountains were turned on.</TE>
<TE>   Now dancers sometimes cavort in the middle of the spurting geysers
and splash in the pond.</TE>
<TE>   The fountains remain a draw, even without music, said Deborah
Matlock, a petroleum company administrative assistant who walks two
blocks to visit Watercourt several times a week.</TE>
<TE>   "The water is always so calming and serene," said the Culver City
resident. "You're in the middle of downtown. But for a few minutes
you can forget where you are."</TE>

plaza.</CP>

<LD>Los Angeles City Council candidate Tony Cardenas attacked opponent
Wendy Greuel on Wednesday for her role in the controversial Playa
Vista project, while she criticized Cardenas, a state assemblyman,
for the state budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   With Tuesday's election just days away and control of the council
potentially at stake, both contenders have flooded the east San
Fernando Valley's 2nd Council District with mail attacking each
other.</LD>
<LD>   In a new mailer and on a live radio debate, Cardenas criticized
Greuel for her role as an executive with DreamWorks SKG in
negotiating with the city for $35 million in tax credits for a
project to build a movie studio as part of the large Playa Vista
development near Marina del Rey.</LD>
<TE>   "My record shows I bring resources to the Valley," Cardenas said
on radio station KPCC-FM (89.3). "Her record shows that she lobbied
to get a $35-million tax credit for a project over by the waterfront,
not for the San Fernando Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas' mailer asserted that "as a lobbyist for a $35-million
city tax credit for her company's development on the beach, Wendy was
taking money from the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel called the charge "preposterous." She said she was never a
lobbyist, the DreamWorks project was canceled in 1999, and it was
never planned on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   She said that Cardenas shares some of the blame for the state's
budget problems because he served as chairman of the Assembly Budget
Committee until recently.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to take responsibility that we have a $17-billion
deficit," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said as head of the Budget Committee he was instrumental
last year in creating a $2.5-billion state reserve fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I put together the biggest budget reserve ever," he said during
the debate. "After Sept. 11, it went downhill fast."</TE>
<TE>   He said the loss of tens of thousand of jobs after the terrorist
attacks, as well as the loss of dozens of conventions in California,
hurt the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel and Cardenas are competing to fill the council seat in a
district representing Studio City, Sunland-Tujunga, Shadow Hills, La
Tuna Canyon and parts of North Hollywood, Mission Hills, Lake View
Terrace, Arleta, Valley Village, Van Nuys and Panorama City.</TE>

<LD>The mother of a gunman who was killed in the 1997 North Hollywood
bank shootout has been charged with welfare fraud, based on
information discovered in the aftermath of the gun battle.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Valerie Nicolescu of
Pasadena this week on suspicion of fraudulently collecting another
woman's Social Security benefits from 1993 until soon after the
robbery.</LD>
<LD>   As Los Angeles police looked for evidence related to her son, Emil
Matasareanu, 30, and a second gunman, they found a mentally retarded
woman in Nicolescu's custody, locked in a dark, foul, boarded-up
building in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Nicolescu was arrested and in 1998 pleaded no contest to charges
of endangering the health of the woman, Georgia Mayo. Nicolescu was
sentenced to the 10 months she had served in the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, that case had led investigators to learn that Nicolescu
had collected benefits not only for Mayo but for a second woman,
Elena Pietrzik, according to police and federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal indictment relates to Pietrzik, an immigrant who
worked at the board and care facility Nicolescu once owned.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1993, Nicolescu applied to receive Social Security benefits
for Pietrzik, declaring that she was her designated payee because
Pietrzik was unable to care for herself, the indictment says.
However, Pietrzik had left the country that month, according to the
document.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Nicolescu again filed a report with the Social
Security Administration saying Pietrzik continued to live with her,
the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government paid Nicolescu at least $37,000 from 1993
to March 1997, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials have acknowledged a problem with a
system in which the state licenses board and care facilities and the
federal government issues residents' benefits to operators. State
officials had pulled Nicolescu's board and care license, but she
allegedly continued getting Mayo's and Pietrzik's Social Security
checks.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena police said they initiated a missing person investigation
for Pietrzik after discovering the Social Security checks and her
driver's license in Nicolescu's possession. Pasadena Police Cmdr.
Rick Law said the department never located her.</TE>
<TE>   Nicolescu, who also goes by Valerie Nicolescu Matasareanu, has
been summoned to appear March 25 in U.S. District Court, said Thom
Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. She could not be
reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>Acting on a teacher's tip, Los Angeles school police arrested five
boys on suspicion of setting fires and burglarizing two North
Hollywood schools, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The youths, 11 to 14 years old, are believed responsible for
vandalizing Coldwater Canyon Elementary School and Madison Middle
School over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives received a tip from a Madison teacher who overheard a
student talking about the Sunday night break-in, said Det. Steve
Crowell of the Los Angeles Unified School District police.</LD>
<TE>   The boys, all from North Hollywood, were taken into custody
Tuesday night. They admitted to burglarizing both schools, and two of
them, both 13, admitted to arson, Crowell said. They were released to
their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Fires caused $50,000 in damage to two classrooms at Coldwater
Canyon Elementary on Sunday. Vandals also broke into five other
classrooms and sprayed fire extinguisher foam in the cafeteria and
auditorium, police said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Madison campus, vandals broke into eight classrooms,
urinating in one of them, said Lt. Stephen Dodson of the school
police force. School officials were trying to determine how much
property was stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just thrilled they caught these criminals," said Assistant
Principal Burt Govenar of Coldwater Canyon Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   School police refused to identify which schools the juveniles
attend.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Edelstein, a fifth-grade teacher in one of the torched
classrooms, said she lost about $10,000 worth of supplies and books
she bought over the last five years. Toys that Edelstein's students
had been collecting for terminally ill children were also destroyed
in the fire, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard to deal with," she said. "What do you say to
10-year-olds who want to know why their classroom was burned?"</TE>

<HD>Mulholland Is a Familiar Face at DWP Centennial Exhibit</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A portrait of William Mulholland towers over a new exhibit
celebrating the 100th anniversary of Los Angeles' Department of Water
and Power at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Griffith Park.</LD>
<LD>   Still controversial more than 65 years after his death in 1935,
Mulholland was the self-taught, Dublin-born engineer who founded the
DWP and planned and supervised the building of the 233-mile Los
Angeles Aqueduct. In 1912, as the first water from the Owens Valley
gushed into the San Fernando Valley, Mulholland gave one of the
pithiest speeches on record to a cheering crowd of 40,000.</LD>
<LD>   "There it is," he said. "Take it."</LD>
<TE>   Cutting the ribbon Tuesday to open the anniversary exhibit was
former DWP General Manager Robert Phillips. At 85, Phillips has known
every head of the utility, starting with Mulholland. He encountered
the charismatic Irishman at the office of his father, who was a DWP
engineer and friend of Mulholland's.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips was about 6 and his mother had gone to the office to get
money to take the children to see Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want from Santa?" Mulholland asked the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips confessed that he didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "You better be making up your mind, because you're going to be
seeing him right now," the no-nonsense Mulholland advised.</TE>
<TE>   At the ceremony, Ruth Galanter, who represents the City Council's
6th District, said the DWP is aware of the importance of balancing
the need for energy with environmental concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Whole political careers have been made out of hating Los Angeles,
and especially DWP, and it isn't fair," she said. "This is not
exactly the same department it was before, but it's the logical
outgrowth."</TE>
<TE>   A retired DWP engineer and amateur historian, Le Val Lund, said
the model of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in the exhibit was Mulholland's
own. It was cleaned, repainted and updated for the show. The
aqueduct, which uses gravity to move water, not pumps, was an
extraordinary achievement, said Lund, who was with the DWP from 1947
until 1990.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Mulholland was aware of the aqueduct's potential
for generating hydroelectric power, Lund said. And unlike so many
other civic projects, Mulholland's aqueduct "was within [its
$24-million] budget and within the schedule," Lund said.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which continues through March, includes a section of
aqueduct pipe the size of a man, a gas mask once issued to DWP
workers, and Mulholland's hammered-copper smoking set. Designed by
Thu Pham, the exhibit also includes innovative tools and other
inventions by employees.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips remembered the last time he saw Mulholland. It was after
the DWP's St. Francis Dam burst in 1928, killing 450 people in the
Santa Clara River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland was blamed for the disaster and taken to court. He
accepted responsibility, acknowledging that the dam probably failed
because of a design flaw. According to Lund and others, the failure
was caused by problems with the soil the dam was built on that could
not have been foreseen, given the technology of the time.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of that last meeting, Phillips had just begun working
for the DWP, surveying in the Owens Valley, a job his father got for
him in what he called "a case of pure nepotism."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland congratulated the young man and said: "I hope you're
just as good as your father is."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips smiled sadly as he recounted his last view of Mulholland,
tormented with guilt over his lethal dam: "He was very kind to me,
very warm, but he was obviously a shattered man."</TE>

and especially DWP, and it isn't fair," she said. "This is not
exactly the same department it was before, but it's the logical
outgrowth."</TE>
<TE>   A retired DWP engineer and amateur historian, Le Val Lund, said
the model of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in the exhibit was Mulholland's
own. It was cleaned, repainted and updated for the show. The
aqueduct, which uses gravity to move water, not pumps, was an
extraordinary achievement, said Lund, who was with the DWP from 1947
until 1990.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Mulholland was aware of the aqueduct's potential
for generating hydroelectric power, Lund said. And unlike so many
other civic projects, Mulholland's aqueduct "was within [its
$24-million] budget and within the schedule," Lund said.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which continues through March, includes a section of
aqueduct pipe the size of a man, a gas mask once issued to DWP
workers, and Mulholland's hammered-copper smoking set. It also
includes innovative tools and other inventions by employees, such as
an improved fire hydrant.</TE>
<TE>   Thu Pham, who designed the exhibit, said she frequently turned to
Lund for information about the DWP and its history. Lund was excited
by such mundane-looking artifacts as a length of copper cable that
was once part of the line transmitting electric power from Hoover Dam
to Southern California. Lund said the department paid for new
aluminum cable by selling off the valuable copper from the old
system.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips remembered the last time he saw Mulholland. It was after
the DWP's St. Francis Dam burst in 1928, killing 450 people in the
Santa Clara River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland was blamed for the disaster and taken to court. He
accepted responsibility, acknowledging that the dam probably failed
because of a design flaw. According to Lund and others, the failure
was caused by problems with the soil the dam was built on that could
not have been foreseen, given the technology of the time.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of that last meeting, Phillips had just begun working
for the DWP, surveying in the Owens Valley, a job his father got for
him in what he called "a case of pure nepotism."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland congratulated the young man and said: "I hope you're
just as good as your father is."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips smiled sadly as he recounted his last view of Mulholland,
tormented with guilt over his lethal dam: "He was very kind to me,
very warm, but he was obviously a shattered man."</TE>

<HD>Write-In Rivals of Kline Face Tall Order</HD>
<DH>Politics: The 11 O.C. challengers hope to unseat the
accused judge by forcing a runoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters face an array of confusing choices in Tuesday's election for
Orange County Superior Court judge. The incumbent, Ronald C. Kline,
is the only name on the ballot, but since his arrest on charges of
child molestation and possession of child pornography, 11 write-in
candidates have thrown their hats in the ring.</LD>
<LD>   The challengers--who face what political observers say is a tough
battle--include former judges, retired police officers and a
councilwoman. One challenger faces possible disbarment for
misappropriating a client's funds.</LD>
<LD>   According to county officials, the last write-in candidate to win
an election was Bruce W. Sumner, a retired judge, who in 1986
narrowly blocked a follower of perennial presidential candidate
Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. from winning the Democratic nomination in
Orange County's 40th congressional district.</LD>
<TE>   The write-ins are hoping that outrage over Kline's legal troubles
will benefit them.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his seat on the bench, Kline needs 50% plus one of the
votes. To force a runoff, officials said, the write-in candidates
together would have to garner at least that number. If they succeed,
the county would schedule another election between the sitting judge
and the challenger who gets the most votes, provided that number is
at least 7,647--exactly 1% of the total votes cast in the 2000
judicial election.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of footwork. You really have to make it personal,"
said Karen Robinson, a Costa Mesa council member and one of Kline's
challengers.</TE>
<TE>   The Judge, an Attorney and a Former Judge</TE>
<TE>   Here are the candidates:</TE>
<TE>   * Kline, 61, of Irvine was appointed to the Orange County Superior
Court in 1995 by then-Gov. Pete Wilson. He has presided over a civil
caseload that included a few high-profile lawsuits, such as the 1997
dispute over televising hockey games between the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim and Fox Sports. Before taking office, Kline worked for more
than 20 years as a lawyer specializing in insurance cases.</TE>
<TE>   Kline has declined interviews, referring calls to his criminal
defense attorney, Paul S. Meyer. Meyer said of Kline: "The man had a
wonderful reputation as a civil trial judge. He was extraordinarily
well-respected, and he brought a tremendous wealth of experience in
complex civil cases from his many years as a trial lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Kline has pleaded not guilty to the charges. But a federal judge
concluded that Kline posed a threat to young children and placed him
under house arrest. She also required that he wear a monitoring
device on his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   * John Adams, 50, of Dana Point is a longtime attorney and
businessman. When he launched his campaign, his Web site listed "more
than 20 years of service" as a lawyer. But from 1982 to 1990 he
allowed his bar membership to lapse by not paying dues, which are
currently $390 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said he worked as a businessman during that period as well
as three more years in the late 1990s. He said he has modified his
Web site to reflect the proper dates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's a reasonable characterization," he said of the
information on the Web site. "It's like being a doctor--once you pass
the bar you are an attorney."</TE>
<TE>   Adams has been involved in city and county coastal water issues
and serves as a judge pro tem in Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's what voters want in a judge--someone who has a
broad life experience, both in employment and the community. I will
bring to the bench a perspective and dynamic that the court needs,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Dan C. Dutcher, 70, of Santa Ana has already spent some time on
the bench--12 years in Westminster court until being unseated by a
challenger in 1994. Since then, he has practiced law out of his home,
concentrating mainly on criminal defense. But being a judge is more
satisfying than being an attorney, Dutcher said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an attorney you take sides," he said, "but as a judge you can
sit back, hope you're being objective, and do what's right. I'm a
good listener, and I don't really give a darn how the case turns out.
I think that too many decisions, at all levels, are too
result-oriented rather than based on applying the law to the facts
and coming down on which side you think is right. We all have biases,
but those biases shouldn't decide a case."</TE>
<TE>   Labor Lawyer, Judge, Family Law Facilitator</TE>
<TE>   * Harris E. Kershnar, 48, of Irvine has been a practicing labor
attorney for 23 years. He also teaches other lawyers seeking
continuing education, has worked as an arbitrator in labor and
securities disputes and earned a listing in last year's Best Lawyers
in America.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would be effective because he has "the attributes
people look for in a judge. I'm very analytical, I'm objective, and I
have an even temperament."</TE>
<TE>   * Barry Kohn, 58, of Laguna Beach is the only openly gay candidate
vying for Kline's seat. He said he has a special feeling for the
diversity likely to face an Orange County judge. It has been fostered
by 20 years on the bench as a California Superior and Municipal Court
commissioner in Los Angeles, he said, during which he has overseen a
variety of cases including preliminary hearings, arraignments, jury
and nonjury criminal trials, civil trials and civil motions.</TE>
<TE>   "Administration is one of my strong points," Kohn said. "I have
experience and judicial abilities. I think it's very important for
the attorneys and parties to see that I am fair, impartial and
articulate."</TE>
<TE>   * Marilyn W. Mirano, 62, of Laguna Beach has been an attorney for
21 years focusing primarily on civil family and personal injury
matters. Since 1997 she has been a family law facilitator in Orange
County Superior Court, where she helps self-represented litigants
navigate the court system.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have the talent and experience to do some real good for
Orange County," Mirano says. "In particular, I'd like to restore some
dignity and decorum to the office that has been eroded."</TE>
<TE>   * Terese S. Oliver, 49, of Orange has been an Anaheim city
prosecutor for 17 years and said she has sent a number of criminals
to jail for offenses including drunk driving, possession and use of
drugs, domestic violence and assault with a deadly weapon. "In the
last 19 years, I have spent virtually every day inside a courtroom,"
she said. "I think I'd be a very good judge. I have a judicial
temperament, and I have all the mechanics down--how to operate a
calendar, budget your time and accomplish your goals. I live and
breathe the evidence code, I know how to rule, and I think I'm very
fair."</TE>
<TE>   * Dale J. Peroutka, 62, of Fountain Valley is a former Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputy who has had a general legal practice for 25
years and works as an arbitrator for Orange County Superior Court and
the Orange County Bar Assn. "I don't specialize," he said, "just try
to help people as I can."</TE>
<TE>   One former client, however, complained to the State Bar Assn. that
the lawyer's help in a 1996 personal injury case had its
limits--after settling the case for $14,000, she said, he
misappropriated $6,200 of it that was supposed to pay off her medical
bills. According to court documents, Peroutka admitted the
misappropriation but said that it was a mistake. The bar association,
on the other hand, called it "moral turpitude" and recommended his
disbarment.</TE>
<TE>   The case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the matter Peroutka called it an "isolated" incident.
"These things happen," he said. "I've taken steps to correct it."</TE>
<TE>   * Karen Robinson, 38, is a Costa Mesa council member. As head of
litigation for the California State University system and a judge pro
tem for the Los Angeles Superior Court since 1994, she said, she has
been involved in a variety of cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very comfortable in the courtroom," she said. "I have a
tremendous amount of experience taking evidence, hearing and
examining witnesses, and maintaining proper courtroom decorum. I do
believe I have the appropriate temperament for a judge--very calm,
cool and collected. I think you have to be tough and courteous,
prepared and knowledgeable and, above all, prepared to do the right
thing based on the law and the evidence presented."</TE>
<TE>   Trial Lawyer, Ex-Cop and Civil Attorney</TE>
<TE>   * Gay Sandoval, 49, of Costa Mesa is a trial lawyer and former
prosecutor who, as a deputy district attorney for 10 years, built
cases against child molesters, abusers, deadbeat parents, drunk
drivers, drug users and scam artists. She has also worked as a judge
pro tem in county courts and has represented small-business owners as
a private attorney for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the perspective I bring is that I've had a lot of
experience with a lot of different types of people--younger people,
older people, people of all ethnicities, religions and economic
strata," she said. "If you don't understand something, you tend to be
afraid of it. I'm pretty patient, even in Small Claims cases;
everybody has to tell their story and not always in the most
organized fashion."</TE>
<TE>   * James D. Stone, 60, is a former Anaheim police officer who lives
in Trabuco Canyon. He has spent 19 years as a trial attorney handling
criminal, civil and family disputes. "I'm a hard worker," he said. "I
put in long hours, and I think that's what the judicial bench needs."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, he was instrumental in forming the Anaheim
Police Department's first crime unit specializing in sex crimes,
including molestation. Since then, Stone said, he's been steadily
expanding his horizons.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the law, love being a trial attorney, love court," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   * William M. Vlosky, 44, of San Clemente is a civil attorney
specializing in cases involving motor vehicles, personal liability
and injury, medical malpractice and insurance. He also serves as an
arbitrator for Orange County courts, a position he has held for five
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Integrity is everything when you're talking about going after
someone who hasn't shown a lot," he said. "I know I would be good
because I have civil experience, and a large part of the bench is
devoted to civil law. There is a lot of technical nuance--you've got
to know areas of medicine, civil engineering and business--stuff I
deal with every day. What I want to do is restore integrity to the
office."</TE>
<TE>   To select a write-in candidate at the ballot box, voters must
write the candidate's name in the space directly below Kline's on the
ballot, then punch the "X" to the right of the name.Registrar Rosalyn
Lever suggested that voters writing in a candidate do so as legibly
as possible. "As long as we can make out who it is," she said, "we
will count it."</TE>

<HD>Baca for Reelection; Yes on C</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lee Baca ran for sheriff four years ago, 39% of the voters
preferred a dead man, incumbent Sherman Block, who died days before
the election. The tentative Baca did not inspire confidence. He's
made real progress and provided leadership on tough issues. The Times
endorses his reelection.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Baca dramatically increased civilian oversight of the
department. He created an Office of Independent Review that hires
civil rights attorneys to investigate misconduct, a turnabout from
the traditional self-investigation. The Sheriff's Department is now
the nation's largest law enforcement agency with civilians actively
involved at all levels of internal investigations. The greater
scrutiny should encourage public trust, but county supervisors should
still closely track Baca to see that he follows through on reforms.</LD>
<LD>   Baca has addressed problems at the jail, including the
reprehensible practice of keeping inmates too long, which resulted in
a $27-million legal settlement. After the embarrassing escape of
Kevin Pullum, who used a phony ID card with a photo of actor Eddie
Murphy to walk out of the Twin Towers jail, Baca tightened security.
Escapes, however, have not been eliminated and trustees still walk
away.</LD>
<TE>   Since the death of a mentally ill man, Kevin Evans, in custody,
Baca has addressed the policy on restraining inmates, but he should
do more to improve medical care. Times staff writer Beth Shuster has
reported allegations of former inmates that medical needs were
neglected in jail. This is an area that the sheriff must manage
better.</TE>
<TE>   The jails, housing about 2,500 diagnosed mentally ill inmates on
any given day, have become the county's largest mental health
facility. Other inmates need help for addiction. Baca has proposed
treatment and a tent city for homeless former inmates, an idea his
critics dismiss as "hug-a-thug." These programs are not softheaded
but practical. Baca should be commended for moving in a direction
that few in law enforcement are willing to go.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff is weakest on budget issues. He spent $25 million over
the budget set by the county supervisors, including $2.4 million on a
plane, a questionable purchase. Baca says some of the deficit came
from 9/11 overtime spending, which is understandable. But if
reelected, he must be more fiscally prudent.</TE>
<TE>   Baca leads a department that patrols 41 cities and unincorporated
areas of Los Angeles County, guards 20,000 inmates in county jails,
provides bailiffs for 500 courtrooms and provides law enforcement for
nine community college campuses. He wants to strengthen management by
increasing the number of senior managers and hiring civilians for key
technology and financial management positions. To allow this, voters
should approve Charter Amendment C, also on Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Baca has opposition from two sergeants, John Stites and
Patrick Gomez, but neither presents a vision beyond attacking Baca.
The Times endorses Sheriff Lee Baca and county Charter Amendment C.</TE>

<LD>The modern litmus test for candidates for state insurance
commissioner is simple and basic: Do they take campaign contributions
from insurance companies or not? That is a major issue in next
Tuesday's Democratic primary for the job. Two leading candidates do
not and one does.</LD>
<LD>   Declining to take insurance money are John Garamendi, who was the
state's first elected insurance commissioner, 1991-95, and Tom
Umberg, a former state Assembly member and federal prosecutor. The
candidate accepting industry contributions is Assemblyman Tom
Calderon (D-Montebello), getting more than $1.5 million from that
source out of a total $2.5 million he raised, the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights reports.</LD>
<LD>   Neither of the two Republican candidates, Wes Bannister and Gary
Mendoza, has received insurance company money. Mendoza says he won't
take any during the primary campaign but will consider it if he is
nominated for the general election. Bannister says he would accept
such contributions but that nobody has offered any.</LD>
<TE>   The Times is not endorsing in this partisan primary contest, but
readers should know that Calderon's heavy reliance on insurance
industry contributions raises serious questions of ethics and
potential conflicts of interest. If Calderon is elected commissioner,
any decision he makes involving a firm that contributed to his
campaign will be under a cloud.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon insists that the money wouldn't influence him: "Either
you have the ability to put a firewall between politics and policy or
you don't." It's not that simple. The only way to avoid the potential
for conflict is to not take insurance company contributions at all.</TE>
<TE>   The need for a clear voluntary standard is still fresh in memory.
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush was driven from office less
than two years ago for allegedly manipulating claims arising from the
1994 Northridge earthquake to benefit both himself and the insurance
companies. He had taken $6 million in contributions from the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it can be hard to raise funds from other sources in this
little-noticed race. But California needs a strong, independent and
fair-minded commissioner regulating the state's $86-billion insurance
industry. A candidate who relies on insurers' contributions for his
election does not meet that standard.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Plan Grabs Notice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is displaying increased enthusiasm for Saudi
Arabia's outline of a peace plan for the Middle East. The vague Saudi
proposal has also been seized on by Arab nations, perhaps with
excessive zeal. But if it helps walk Israel and the Palestinians back
from the brink of all-out war, the United States should roll out the
red carpet.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah has offered to establish diplomatic
relations with Israel in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from
territories occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. As the guardian
of Islam's holiest sites, Saudi Arabia wields great influence in the
region. Saudi officials have also expressed willingness to recognize
Israeli sovereignty over parts of Jerusalem, a chief point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell first described the idea as a
"minor development," and some critics called it a ploy to improve
tattered Saudi relations with the U.S. This week Powell shifted to
characterizing it as an "important step." However, Wednesday's
surprise diatribe in the United Nations by Saudi Arabia's ambassador,
who repeated the standard anti-Israeli vitriol, raised the question
of which Saudi to heed. That was especially true because the
ambassador's harangue came soon after an Abdullah aide in Washington
said the kingdom wanted to show Israel that peace was possible.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has fumbled numerous chances
for peace and has been increasingly marginalized, endorsed the Saudi
initiative, as did leaders of several Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   A European Union diplomat said Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
told him he wanted more information and would be willing to meet with
officials from Saudi Arabia. That is encouraging because Sharon has
taken an increasingly tough stance with the Palestinians, receiving
little criticism from Washington in the process. The Israeli prime
minister is being pressured by hard-liners who want Israel to
reassert control over more of the West Bank and Gaza. But he also has
had to confront the refusal of some reserve army officers to serve in
the occupied territories and a call by 1,000 former army officers for
a unilateral withdrawal from those territories.</TE>
<TE>   There have been Palestinian and Israeli objections to the Saudi
proposal, which clearly is little more than a starting point. But if
it does launch a process to end the fighting that has killed nearly
300 Israelis and nearly 900 Palestinians over 17 months, it should be
welcomed. A Saudi distancing from the remarks of the kingdom's U.N.
ambassador would be especially welcome.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, peace will be up to Israel and the Palestinians. But a
lasting calm will require that Israelis see their borders as secure,
defensible and recognized by Arab nations. The Saudi plan bolsters
U.S. efforts to end this frustrating conflict. The U.S. response
should be that the more help from allies in the Mideast and Europe,
the better.</TE>

<HD>Tunnel Is Found Under Border</HD>
<DH>Smuggling: Agents say it may have been used for two or
three years to transport drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Authorities on Wednesday discovered what they described as a
sophisticated tunnel used for smuggling drugs beneath the U.S.-Mexico
border in rural San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   The tunnel ended inside a farmhouse about 1,000 feet north of the
border fence in the community of Boulevard, Calif., about 55 miles
east of downtown San Diego, said Donald Thornhill Jr., a spokesman
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   "It was in a house, under a staircase--sophisticated," Thornhill
said Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   He said the 4-by-4-foot entrance led to a reinforced passageway
about 20 feet underground as it crossed the international boundary
east of the border town of Tecate, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Agents believe the tunnel may have been in use for two or three
years.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests were made as federal agents searched the property, a
former pig farm, but agents found 500 pounds of marijuana whose
freshness suggested the tunnel had been used recently, Thornhill
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said there could be arrests in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the tunnel was used by the Arellano Felix drug
gang based in Tijuana. Thornhill declined to say what steered agents
to the site. The tunnel appeared to lead to a building on the Mexican
side.</TE>
<TE>   Thornhill said the property was unoccupied except for a caretaker
who was not viewed as a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The boulder-strewn countryside there has been used frequently to
smuggle illegal immigrants into the country. It was not immediately
known whether the tunnel was used for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the tunnel was reminiscent of the uncovering of a
"narcotunnel" in 1993 under the border near the Otay Mesa port of
entry in San Diego. That tunnel, discovered by Mexican federal
authorities hunting the killers of the Roman Catholic cardinal of
Guadalajara, extended about a quarter-mile onto the U.S. side but
never reached the warehouse that was to be its terminus.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the passage was sealed in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Bush Sr. Apologizes for Marin Hot Tub Slam</HD>
<DH>Gaffe: Ex-president says he slurred county residents in
discussing American Talib John Walker Lindh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Former President George Bush told a newspaper he is sorry he maligned
this area by describing American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh as
"some misguided Marin County hot-tubber."</LD>
<LD>   The Marin Independent Journal invited residents of the bucolic
county just north of San Francisco to tell the former president about
their home. The newspaper ran excerpts.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the writers scolded Bush.</LD>
<TE>   "Call off the dogs please," he wrote. "I apologize. I am chastened
and will never use 'hot tub' and 'Marin County' in the same sentence
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't even try to explain my position except to say I was and
remain so offended by John Walker Lindh that I hurt others'
feelings," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "In the opinion of your outraged letter writers," he added, "I
condemned all of Marin County with a hot tub reference. Obviously, I
struck a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "Now your readers have attacked me on my granddaughters, on my
residence, on abortion, on Enron, on my being a Texan and on my
pronunciation of Marin. You name it, a lot of angst has surfaced, and
it's all my fault. Though I only garnered 23% of the vote in Marin in
1992, I was your president and I should have known better. I
apologize to those who supported me that were offended, and I also
apologize to the unenlightened who did not support me.</TE>
<TE>   "I will now soak in my own hot tub and try to be more sensitive to
the feelings of others--not John Walker Lindh, though," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "My offhand comment struck a nerve I hadn't intended," Bush said
in a telephone conversation Tuesday with Executive Editor Jackie
Kerwin.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw the depth of feeling of the responses, I said, 'Why
not just say you're sorry?' I believe if you screw up, you say you're
sorry and move on."</TE>

<HD>The Tortoise and the Hare: A California GOP Primary Tale</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Who would have thought it? Bill Simon Jr. and his guru, Sal
Russo--that's about all.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly not Richard Riordan. Not the political pros. Not the
pundits.</LD>
<TE>   Boy, were we wrong!</TE>
<TE>   Who'd have thought that political neophyte Simon would be running
ahead of former two-term Los Angeles Mayor Riordan, according to the
polls, on the brink of the election? Thought that somebody who had
never even voted in a state primary, based on L.A. County records,
would be in position to win the primary--and become the Republican
nominee for governor.</TE>
<TE>   It's the most incredible come-from-behind race--and the worst
fall-on-your-face stumble--in modern California politics.</TE>
<TE>   Put it this way: Last September, according to the independent
Field Poll, Riordan led Simon by 41 points. A month ago, Riordan
still led by 33. By Wednesday, Simon had surged ahead by 6 points.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is predicting next Tuesday's outcome. But win or lose,
Simon's run has been remarkable. And Riordan's has been just awful.</TE>
<TE>   How'd they get to this spot? Here are some ways:</TE>
<TE>   * We all saw it on TV. Gov. Gray Davis tripped Riordan running
down the track. Democrat Davis may wind up spending more than any
Republican in the GOP primary, around $8 million for anti-Riordan
attack ads.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' messing in the Republican primary--the all-out effort to
choose his own fall opponent--is unprecedented in California
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The tag line in one of Riordan's TV ads is exactly on target:
"Dick Riordan: the Republican Gray Davis fears the most." Well,
correct that: feared--before Davis started kicking him.</TE>
<TE>   Davis plans to keep running the anti-Riordan attack ads until
election day. He hopes to take out the moderate candidate on Tuesday
so he won't have to face him in November.</TE>
<TE>   It's equivalent to what President George Bush should have done in
1991: Go all the way to Baghdad and take out Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   * The single, most devastating blow to Riordan, many say, was
delivered by former Gov. George Deukmejian. The revered Republican
held news conferences and did a TV spot declaring: "Riordan is a man
I couldn't vote for."</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian started speaking out three weeks ago at a Republican
state convention. He gave wavering conservatives all over California
justification to reject Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   He complained that Riordan had raised $1 million for Democratic
causes, half of it for his two-time opponent, then-L.A. Mayor Tom
Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan was right during a debate when he said Deukmejian held
"grudges." But he was wrong to say it, drawing gasps from shocked
delegates.</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian's TV ad was aired to help Secretary of State Bill
Jones. It was Jones' only real impact on the race. The spot badly
wounded Riordan. But it didn't even begin to heal Jones, a party
pariah for having double-crossed George W. Bush in the 2000
presidential primaries.</TE>
<TE>   * From the start, this race was Riordan's to lose. And he ran like
he intended to.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Riordan tried to ignore the elephant in the room. This
was a Republican primary, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan took conservatives for granted and appealed to the
moderates he'd need in November. He emphasized his position on
abortion rights and told the party that its "pro-life" platform plank
seemed anti-women. Become "inclusive," the former mayor warned, or
become "an extinct species."</TE>
<TE>   Many party activists might have agreed, but they didn't like their
faces rubbed in it.</TE>
<TE>   Not until the very end has Riordan begun to stress core Republican
issues: low taxes, safe streets, quality education.... Positions
that, incidentally, also appeal to many Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan is not a good listener, associates say. He doesn't take
advice easily--even on a subject he knows zilch about, like statewide
Republican politics.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does he have the personality or communication skills to wing
it.</TE>
<TE>   * Simon, by contrast, does listen and follow direction--especially
from his veteran campaign strategist, Russo. And he smiles a lot.
He's likable.</TE>
<TE>   "A compassionate conservative," Simon calls himself. Mostly, he
stayed above the mud-splattering and followed the conservative
playbook: capital gains tax cut, less business regulation....</TE>
<TE>   Simon got an indispensable boost from Rudy Giuliani, the former
New York mayor whose popularity soared after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Giuliani cut TV ads for Simon and stumped with him,
attracting invaluable attention to the little-known underdog.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investor Simon couldn't have done any of it without pumping
$5 million of his own money into the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Who would've thought? Decades from now, politicians and pundits
will be reminding themselves: Remember Dick Riordan. Remember Bill
Simon.</TE>

<HD>More Health-Care Aides Lack Insurance, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Benefits: California leads the nation in workers who do not
have coverage, Harvard survey says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of health-care workers without health insurance is
increasing rapidly nationwide and according to an article in the
March issue of the American Journal of Public Health, California is
among the worst cases.</LD>
<LD>   A Harvard Medical School study analyzed data from 10 years of the
Census Bureau's Current Population Survey and found that from 1988 to
1998, the amount of uninsured health- care personnel rose from 8% to
12% nationally.</LD>
<LD>   "There's something particularly offensive in saying to a woman
who's working for a hospital that if you get sick or your kids get
sick, you're not going to be able to get the care you need," said
David Himmelstein, one of two doctors and a Harvard Medical School
student who conducted the study.</LD>
<TE>   California has the largest number of uninsured health-care workers
with 154,000, followed by Texas with 151,000 and New York with
110,000.</TE>
<TE>   "California generally has a pretty poor record of health coverage
for health-care workers," Himmelstein said, citing the state's large
amount of low-wage workers, particularly women and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Women and minorities surpass the national percentage of uninsured
health-care employees, while men and whites are below. The survey
said 13% of women workers are uninsured; 21% of blacks; and 25% of
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Maura Kealey, health policy specialist for Service Employees
International Union, said this is particularly poignant in Los
Angeles because of the number of Latino workers.</TE>
<TE>   The professions with the highest percentages of uninsured
employees are nurses aides, nursing home workers and custodial staff.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd like the health-care industry to practice what it
preaches," said Drew Altman, president of Kaiser Family Foundation,
"but the health-care industry is just like any other industry when it
comes to low-wage workers."</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that 10% of uninsured children live in
households with a health-care worker, which Himmelstein said
surprised him most.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn. of Health Plans,
said the fact that health-care workers often don't have health
coverage didn't surprise him, but that he was disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not any worse for a low-wage employee in a restaurant to be
uninsured than a low-wage employee in a nursing home to be
uninsured," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the same family, the same risks and it's unfortunate
for anyone to be uninsured," Zelman said.</TE>

<HD>Klamath Basin Plan Fuels Debate</HD>
<DH>Environment: Shift in strategy could reduce water for
endangered fish in favor of farming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Setting up another potential showdown in the Klamath Basin, the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation took steps Wednesday toward adopting a 10-year
operating plan that could cut water to endangered fish and give it to
farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists say the biological assessment represents a blunt
assault on federal endangered species laws and could push coho salmon
and two types of sucker fish toward extinction.</LD>
<LD>   The 112-page report sets in motion a series of reviews over the
next month that by early April should determine how water will be
divided over the next decade between farmers and fish in the broad,
arid basin straddling the Oregon-California border.</LD>
<TE>   Federal water officials heralded the plan as a cooperative effort
to meet the needs of agriculture and endangered fish in the Klamath
River and the lake that feeds it.</TE>
<TE>   ''Reclamation is committed to a collaborative approach,'' said
John Keys, commissioner of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists say the draft blueprint seems to be devised
to test the limits of the federal Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   ''The prospect is for more conflict, another hot summer of
protests in the Klamath Basin,'' said Felice Pace of the Klamath
Forest Alliance. Pace said a legal battle between the federal
government and environmental groups is inevitable, concluding that
the Bush administration ''wants to arm the nation and disarm the
Endangered Species Act.''</TE>
<TE>   Steve Pedery of WaterWatch of Oregon added: ''If rolling back
endangered species exemptions were an Olympic sport, the Bush
administration would be gold medal winners.''</TE>
<TE>   Glen Spain, who represents West Coast fishermen, said the
biological assessment proposes cutting river flows in some cases to
less than a third of what salmon need to survive in dry months.</TE>
<TE>   ''It would plunge the whole lower river into permanent drought,''
Spain said. ''This is little more than a thinly veiled effort to
blame all of Klamath's problems on endangered species, not the
over-allocation of water.''</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the lake would be pushed to a level that could hurt
sucker fish by depleting oxygen, increasing the effects of toxic
substances and leaving wetlands high and dry.</TE>
<TE>   Spain and others also say the Bureau of Reclamation has used a
recent report by the National Academy of Sciences on Klamath to more
aggressively favor farmers over fish.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-page interim report, part of a yearlong study, declared
that a sharp cutback in water to farmers last year was not justified
by the science.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worry that the Bush administration will pressure
wildlife agencies to avoid aggressively countering the Bureau of
Reclamation's approach.</TE>
<TE>   Some also said the late arrival of the report, a month before the
traditional April 1 start of planting in Klamath, puts additional
strain on the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries
Service, which act as shepherds to the endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Bureau of Reclamation, which for nearly a century
has operated the network of canals and culverts in the Klamath area,
say they are trying to avoid a reprise of last summer's fight.</TE>
<TE>   The biological assessment, they said, includes innovative concepts
intended to ease tensions. Those include proposals to help fish in
dry years by buying or leasing water from willing sellers, including
farmers in the Klamath Basin.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the agency talks of shifting irrigation practices to
make better use of winter runoff that otherwise drains out of the
basin, upgrading water quality and improving wetlands that act as
nurseries for fish.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, the region has been whipsawed by strife.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of a fearsome drought, farmers were told their
traditionally plentiful irrigation supplies would be virtually
suspended because of concerns over the survival of two species of
sucker fish in Upper Klamath Lake and coho salmon downstream.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath's agricultural community mounted a summer-long siege of
protests, including several successful attempts by demonstrators to
crank open the head gates that block the flow of water to farms.</TE>
<TE>   This year looked to be more promising, given a far more abundant
snowpack in the sprawling drainage basin of the Klamath as well as
new public resolve by all sides to work toward a solution.</TE>

<HD>Dog Attack Scene Is Described</HD>
<DH>Trial: Neighbor, who says she was 'panic-stricken,'
testifies she saw a dark object on top of victim while watching
through peephole in door.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An elderly woman who lived across the hall from San Francisco dog
mauling victim Diane Whipple testified Wednesday that she heard a
barking dog and panicky pleas for help just moments before she saw a
"dark object" covering a body lying on the floor outside her door.</LD>
<LD>   Esther Birkmaier said she was looking through the peephole in her
door when she saw what looked like a dog covering the body of
Whipple, who was lying face-down in the hallway.</LD>
<LD>   Later, during cross-examination by a defense attorney, she said
the dark object could have been the figure of the dog's owner,
Marjorie Knoller, whose attorney has said she tried to save Whipple
by covering Whipple's body with her own.</LD>
<TE>   Although Birkmaier never saw the dog biting Whipple, she provided
riveting descriptions of the terror she felt as she listened to cries
of "Help me! Help me!" the sounds of the snarling dog and Knoller
frantically yelling, "Get off! Get off!"</TE>
<TE>   "I was sort of panic-stricken," Birkmaier said, explaining that
she didn't open her door for fear she would be attacked. At one
point, something, which she assumed was a dog, crashed against her
door with such force that she feared it would give way, Birkmaier
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, 33, a college lacrosse coach, was mauled by two large
Presa Canario dogs as she tried to enter her sixth-floor apartment
Jan. 26, 2001, in San Francisco. One of the dogs, Bane, tore into her
neck, and the other, Hera, ripped at her clothes.  Whipple was still
alive when police arrived, but was bleeding profusely as she lay on
the hallway floor with her clothes stripped off by the attacking
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers, Inspector Leslie Forrestal, testified in Los
Angeles Superior Court Wednesday that Whipple attempted to crawl to
her apartment until the officer told her to lie still. She died at
the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, and her husband, Robert Noel, 60, are charged with
involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog. Noel was not
in the apartment building at the time of the attack. Knoller also
faces a second-degree murder charge and could receive a sentence of
15 years to life. Noel faces a possible sentence of four years.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved from San Francisco because of intense
publicity the case was receiving in the Bay Area. Prosecutors allege
that the couple, both of whom are lawyers, knew that their massive
dogs, each weighing more than 100 pounds, were dangerous, and that
Knoller didn't do anything to prevent Whipple's death.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys Nedra Ruiz and Bruce Hotchkiss say the dogs were
not vicious and describe the attack as an unexpected, tragic
accident. They said their clients were responsible owners and that
Knoller was bitten and bruised as she tried desperately to stop the
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Wednesday, a paramedic said she treated a minor cut
on Knoller's thumb and that her clothes, face and hair were matted
with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Birkmaier told jurors she was drawn to her door by loud barking
and a woman's voice she did not recognize pleading for help.</TE>
<TE>   During questioning by Assistant Dist. Atty. Jim Hammer, she said
that as she peered through the peephole, she saw a portion of
Whipple's body lying in the hallway with groceries scattered about.</TE>
<TE>   Although she told Hammer she thought a dark object on top of the
body was that of a dog, she conceded during Ruiz's questioning that
she never saw the object move, bite the victim or rip at her
clothing. Birkmaier acknowledged Wednesday that in police interviews
subsequent to the attack, she never referred to the object as a dog.
Knoller was wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and sweatpants at the time
of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer then pointed out that Birkmaier, in her initial statements
to police and her personal notes on the incident, said she saw a dog
on top of Whipple and didn't even refer to a "dark object."</TE>
<TE>   After seeing Whipple on the floor, Birkmaier said she rushed to
her kitchen to call police. While in the kitchen, she heard Knoller
trying to stop the attack, yelling, "No! No!" at one point and "Get
off! Get off!" and "Stop! Stop!" at other times.</TE>
<TE>   After calling police, she went back to her door. "Finally, the
barking stopped, the growling stopped and then there was silence,"
Birkmaier said.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, police, paramedics and dog control officers
arrived. Forrestal described the bloody scene, displaying photos of
Whipple's body and the blood-drenched hallway carpet and walls.
Animal control officer Michael Scott testified that he and a fellow
officer had trouble taking custody of the dogs.</TE>

<HD>State's PG&amp;E Plan Moves Ahead</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bankruptcy judge lets the PUC submit a proposal to
make the utility solvent despite charges that its figures are flawed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Over vehement objections from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., a federal
bankruptcy judge granted state regulators permission Wednesday to
submit an alternative to the utility's own plan for reorganizing its
finances.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E argued that a proposal outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission was off by billions of dollars and was not
credible. Judge Dennis Montali called the plan challenging but said
it was legally permissible and deserved consideration.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling was the second recent victory for state regulators.
Montali previously declared that the PG&amp;E plan was fatally flawed
because it attempts to preempt dozens of state laws. But the company
will submit a modified version next week and hopes it will be
confirmed.</LD>
<TE>   PG&amp;E filed for protection from creditors almost a year ago. The
company submitted a reorganization plan that called for shifting its
generation and transmission assets to new subsidiaries of its parent
company and outside the reach of the utilities commission.</TE>
<TE>   Calling PG&amp;E's plan a regulatory jailbreak, California officials
moved to submit their own plan and to challenge PG&amp;E's exclusive
right to have the only plan under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's proposal keeps PG&amp;E's hydroelectric facilities
under state regulation and promises to pay creditors in full and to
restore the utility to financial health. Ratepayers would continue to
pay record high electricity rates, and dividends would be suspended
to help pay off the company's debts.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, PG&amp;E lead counsel Jim Lopes attacked the
commission's plan, saying that it distorts the company's finances by
as much as $5 billion and would not work. But commission lawyers
blamed PG&amp;E information for some of the inaccuracies and said the
errors would be fixed when their plan is filed.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities commission General Counsel Gary Cohen told the judge:
"We will move heaven and Earth to meet any timetable you set. This
case is hugely important to ... the state of California."</TE>
<TE>   Montali said he wanted the plan submitted by April 15 or sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also approved the selection of San Francisco mediators
Anthony Piazza and Marc Feder to try to resolve all matters of
dispute among the state, PG&amp;E and the official creditors committee.
The judge authorized a $51,000 payment for three days of mediation.
The dates and locations were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E is engaged in several actions with the commission, including
a federal lawsuit over the company's contention that it should have
been allowed to fully collect wholesale power costs from ratepayers
during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E also has announced its intention to appeal Montali's ruling
against its plan to preempt state laws.</TE>

<HD>PUC Member to Quit, Blames Frustrations</HD>
<DH>Regulators: Richard Bilas, one of two Republicans on the
board, also cites his health. Davis will name his successor,
increasing his imprint on the board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of two Republicans on the California Public Utilities Commission
resigned Wednesday for what he called health reasons and frustration
with policy changes at the powerful agency.</LD>
<LD>   Richard A. Bilas, an economist appointed to the PUC by former Gov.
Pete Wilson in 1997, will step down nine months before his term ends
Dec. 31.</LD>
<LD>   His departure creates an opportunity for Gov. Gray Davis to name a
new member and gain greater influence over the commission, which
regulates private electric, natural gas, railroad, water and
telecommunications companies.</LD>
<TE>   Davis appointees Carl W. Wood and Loretta M. Lynch, the PUC
president, have occasionally defied the governor on high-stakes
electricity industry decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Bilas said he will leave the commission March 8, two days after
the PUC is scheduled to make an important decision about the future
of electricity deregulation in California.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member commission is set to vote on whether businesses
and institutions can continue to buy power from companies other than
major utilities.</TE>
<TE>   A Fulbright scholar, college professor and former talk show host,
Bilas joined the PUC after it had voted in 1994 and 1995 to open
California's electricity industry to competition.</TE>
<TE>   But when the deregulation plan went badly awry in 2000 and 2001,
Bilas addressed the fallout, including voting for the largest
electricity rate hike in the PUC's history.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Duque, Bilas' fellow Republican on the PUC, called Bilas a
collegial, independent thinker and said he hopes the new appointee
will have similar attributes.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to lose him. He is a good friend, and I have enjoyed
working with him over the years," said Duque, whose term expires Jan.
1. "But I will survive as the remaining Republican on the
commission," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Davis, Bilas explained that his own brush with
cancer a year ago and his wife's health make it impossible for him to
serve adequately as a commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "Moreover," he wrote, "the events of Sept. 11 have changed my
thinking considerably."</TE>
<TE>   Bilas, 67, added without elaboration that "I have been most
frustrated by the policy changes at the commission."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, he said he would not explain his frustration with
the commission until after he resigns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's premature," he said. "I've still got to be with the
commission for another 10 days."</TE>
<TE>   Bilas added that he has "nothing but good memories" from his years
on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Florio, senior attorney with the Utility Reform Network, said
Bilas probably got weary of being on the losing side of so many votes
at the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   Often the commission's votes were split 3 to 2 along partisan
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Florio said Bilas was consistently a free-market advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the anti-regulation guy," Florio said, "and we naturally
are pro-regulation."</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Davis thanked Bilas for his service and
said he would begin searching immediately for a replacement.</TE>

<LD>Cal State Sonoma is abandoning its mascot of 40 years, the Cossack,
and will become the Seawolves when classes begin in August.</LD>
<LD>   University President Ruben Arminana chose the new mascot after
receiving proposals from a campuswide committee formed by student
government.</LD>
<LD>   Most predicted the reaction to the change would be mixed. Those
opposing the original name linked it to barbarism and anti-Semitism.
Fans of the old name said the school was dumping four decades of

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The crucial Sierra Nevada snowpack has slipped below normal after an
above-average early winter, according to a survey Wednesday by the
California Department of Water Resources.</LD>
<LD>   Snow levels dropped to about 90% of normal due to dry periods
during the last two months. But the snowpack that feeds reservoirs
and hydroelectricity plants is still far deeper than last year, when
accumulations about a third less than normal aggravated the state's
electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Snowfall in the northern Sierra remained slightly above average,
but was below average to the south.</LD>
<TE>   A wet spring could bring the snowpack back up to normal, said
department spokesman Jeff Cohen, although the region's wettest months
usually are January and February.</TE>

<HD>Spike Milligan, 83; Radio 'Goon' Inspired British Comics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Spike Milligan, comedian, author, gadfly and the last surviving
member of "The Goon Show" on BBC radio, died Wednesday of kidney
failure at his home in Rye on the southeast coast of England, his
agent Norma Farnes said. Milligan was 83.</LD>
<LD>   His sly comedy made him a British institution and inspired later
generations of British comics, but he was almost as famous for his
struggles with manic depression and his rages against human folly,
the British variety in particular.</LD>
<LD>   A tall, thin man with rather wistful blue eyes, Milligan was a
vegetarian, a nonsmoker and an avid environmentalist.</LD>
<TE>   "I support all the causes that are trying to increase the
sensitivity of the human race to the odious things that they do," he
once told an interviewer. "We're a pretty horrendous crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine
launched the Goons on May 28, 1951, in a radio show titled "Crazy
People Featuring the Goons."</TE>
<TE>   Later retitled "The Goon Show," the program, which ran until 1960,
set a comic style and became a classic.</TE>
<TE>   The program involved the Goons in their constant defense of the
British Empire from nefarious threats. The show satirized many
traditional British ideas and served as an inspiration for a
generation of British comedians.</TE>
<TE>   "We all had this sort of lunatic sense of humor.... We turned
everything into imbecility ... doing things like climbing Mount
Everest from the inside," Milligan once said.</TE>
<TE>   British comic Eddie Izzard once called Milligan "the godfather of
alternative comedy for the world."</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the New York Times Book Review years ago, Beatle John
Lennon remembered "The Goon Show" as hipper than the hippest and
madder than "'Mad,' a conspiracy against reality. A coup d'etat of
the mind."</TE>
<TE>   One of Milligan's biggest fans was Prince Charles, patron of the
Goon Show Preservation Society, who called Milligan's death "the end
of a great era of British comedy, exemplified by Spike's
extraordinary genius for the play on words and for the art of the
nonsensical unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   Milligan, author of dozens of books, never became as widely known
as Sellers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had the same comic ability as Peter Sellers," he told
the Sunday Express. "But the cards fell right for him when he went
into films and never came right for me."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers died in 1980, Bentine in 1996 and Secombe in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Milligan's film credits include "The Running, Jumping and Standing
Still Film," an 11-minute caper directed in 1959 by Richard Lester.</TE>
<TE>   Milligan played his own father in a 1972 adaptation of his war
memoir "Adolf Hitler, My Part in His Downfall," and had numerous bit
parts in films, including "The Life of Brian."</TE>
<TE>   He was born Terence Alan Milligan on April 16, 1918, in Bombay and
spent his first 16 years in India, where his Irish father was a
sergeant major in the British army. His mother was English.</TE>
<TE>   Milligan was educated at Roman Catholic convents in Poona and
Rangoon before the family returned to Britain.</TE>
<TE>   He learned to play the double bass and the trumpet and worked in
local bands in London. He went to war as an army gunner, but after
seeing a lot of action, he first sought psychiatric treatment in
1944.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he was in and out of hospitals with his mental
problems, which reached a peak while he was writing a new "Goon Show"
each week for six months.</TE>
<TE>   "The war started the gradual deterioration of my mental stability,
but 'The Goon Show' finished the process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His first marriage, to Ann Howe, fell apart under the strain. She
left him and their three children.</TE>
<TE>   Milligan raised them and a daughter from his second marriage, in
1962, to Patricia Ridgeway who died of cancer in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   He married Shelagh Sinclair in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a change in British immigration laws, Milligan
discovered in 1960 that because his father was not born in Britain,
he would have to reapply for citizenship and take an oath of
allegiance to the queen, despite his years of army service.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, he became an Irish citizen instead. Britain made amends
in 2000 by making Milligan an honorary knight.</TE>
<TE>   The personality Milligan showed to the world was often prickly and
disillusioned.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to be a total idiot to be happy today," he said in
1987. "I would never have had four children if I'd known what I know
now."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife and his children.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.</TE>

<HD>Lawrence Tierney, 82; Actor Was Real-Life Tough Guy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawrence Tierney, a veteran character actor and onetime B-movie
leading man whose two-fisted, tough-guy image on screen in the 1940s
and '50s rivaled that of his off-screen personal life, has died. He
was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Tierney, who suffered several strokes in recent years and had
recent bouts with pneumonia, died in his sleep Tuesday during a brief
stay at a Los Angeles nursing home.</LD>
<LD>   Best known for his gangster roles in an 80-film career that
spanned 50 years, Tierney's most memorable credits include the title
role in the 1945 B-movie classic "Dillinger" and the leader of a pack
of vicious killers in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 crime drama "Reservoir
Dogs."</LD>
<TE>   Off-screen, the actor's arrests for drunken brawls at bars and
Hollywood parties took a heavy toll on his once-promising Hollywood
career in the 1950s. Booze was always at the root of his misbehavior,
which included tearing a public phone off the wall, hitting a waiter
in the face with a sugar bowl, breaking a college student's jaw and
attempting to choke a cab driver.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a drink in, oh, five years now," Tierney said in
his clipped, tough-guy voice during a 1987 interview. "I finally
wised up. I'd say it was about time. Heck, I threw away about seven
careers through drink."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1919, Tierney was a star member of his
high school track team. He received an athletic scholarship to
Manhattan College but left school after two years to work as a
laborer on the New York Aqueduct. After traveling around the country
and working a variety of odd jobs, the strong-featured Tierney landed
work as a catalog model.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by an acting coach, Tierney joined the Black Friars
theater group and later the American-Irish Theater, where he was
spotted by a talent scout and signed by RKO Studios in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   After supporting roles in pictures such as "The Ghost Ship" and
"The Falcon Out West," Tierney achieved sudden stardom in 1945,
playing the vicious gangster John Dillinger in "Dillinger," while on
loan to independent producers.</TE>
<TE>   The die was cast. Billed as "the handsome bad man of the screen"
when "Dillinger" was released, Tierney returned to RKO where he
portrayed tough guys on both sides of the law. He starred in such
films as "San Quentin," "Step by Step," "The Devil Thumbs a Ride,"
"Born to Kill," "Bodyguard," "Kill or Be Killed" and "The Hoodlum."</TE>
<TE>   He also played the villain who caused the train wreck in Cecil B.
DeMille's 1952 best-picture Oscar-winner, "The Greatest Show on
Earth."</TE>
<TE>   But by then Tierney's off-set misadventures were taking a toll on
his career.</TE>
<TE>   Headlines of the period tell the story: "Film 'Dillinger' Booked
on Drunk Charge." "Court Warns Film Actor to Be Good." "Actor Tierney
Must Sleep on Jail Floor." "Tierney Goes to Jail Again."</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1960s, the onetime B-movie leading man had been
reduced to small parts. After appearing in John Cassavetes' "A Child
Is Waiting" in 1963, he moved to France for several years. But his
scrapes with the law continued in Europe, as they did when he
returned to the United States in the late '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Back living in New York, he was known as a tough guy who drank and
fought with ex-cons, cops and hoods, according to a nephew, Michael
Tierney. In 1973, Tierney was stabbed during a brawl outside a New
York bar near the scruffy hotel where he lived.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he was questioned and released by New York police
in connection with the apparent suicide leap of a 24-year-old woman
from the fourth-floor window of her midtown apartment. Tierney told
police he had arrived for a visit when the woman "just went out the
window."</TE>
<TE>   In those years, Tierney worked variously as a bartender, a steel
worker, a crane operator and even as the driver of a horse-drawn
carriage in Central Park. He acted sporadically, landing small parts
in films such as Otto Preminger's "Such Good Friends" (1971), Andy
Warhol's "Bad" (1977), and Cassavetes' "Gloria" (1980) and "Arthur"
(1981).</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Hollywood in late 1983, the gravely voiced Tierney,
by then overweight and bald, rekindled his acting career. He
guest-starred on television shows such as "Star Trek: The Next
Generation," "Remington Steele," "Fame" and "Hunter," and had a
recurring role on "Hill Street Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Tierney--the brother of actor Scott Brady, who died in 1985--also
appeared in "Prizzi's Honor," "The Naked Gun" and "Tough Guys Don't
Dance," in which he played Ryan O'Neal's hard-drinking father.</TE>
<TE>   When his uncle returned to Hollywood, Michael Tierney said, "he
was much better behaved. He was still Larry for those people who knew
him--he was still a tough guy, but not in jail all the time or
anything like that.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who knew Larry knew that wasn't all there was to
Larry. He was a wacky, kind of quirky, comical guy, and a very nice
man to a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Tierney is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Tierney, of Park
City, Utah.</TE>

<HD>Anemic Turnout of 36% Is Predicted for Tuesday</HD>
<DH>Secretary of state says primary comes too early--eight
months before the general--for voters to focus on it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Despite a dramatic race among three Republicans fighting to become
governor, only about one in three registered voters are expected to
cast ballots in California's primary election Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the 36% turnout prediction holds up, voter participation in the
contest would rank as the second-lowest ever for a California
election. In the 1994 gubernatorial primary, just 35% of registered
voters went to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing I am more concerned about ... than the decline
in voter participation," Secretary of State Bill Jones said Wednesday
in announcing his forecast.</LD>
<TE>   "Especially in light of 9/11 and all the flag-waving and
patriotism, there is no reason not to get out and vote."</TE>
<TE>   In making their predictions before each election, officials weigh
a variety of factors, including the weather, the presence of
high-interest ballot measures and possible distractions for voters.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout is likely to suffer this year because the primary is
earlier than ever, there is no competition for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination and many Californians have been focused on
the just-concluded Winter Olympics, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Another indicator of apathy is that requests for absentee
ballots--which have risen steadily in recent years--have remained
flat in most counties and declined in some, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot going on--the holidays, the Super Bowl, the
Olympics, the tragedies [of 9/11]," Jones said. "But that's no excuse
for Californians not to exercise their right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   Although predicting turnout is not done by a mathematical formula,
the forecasts usually come within a few percentage points of the
actual number.</TE>
<TE>   That makes such guesswork of great interest to the GOP candidates
duking it out for the chance to take on Gov. Gray Davis in
November--Jones, businessman Bill Simon Jr. and former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Times poll showed that with a moderate turnout--41% of
likely Republican voters--Riordan and Simon were tied, with Jones
finishing a distant third. But if only 37% cast ballots, Simon would
lead Riordan 29% to 26%, according to the poll.</TE>
<TE>   Many political consultants have grumbled that the unusually early
primary has left voters unaware that there is an election coming up.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Spillane, political director for Riordan, said the short
window of time between the holidays and March 5 "makes it hard to get
your message out and make the campaign relevant in people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Flint, a strategist for Simon, said the campaign's polling
and focus groups suggest "many people, even interested and educated
people who typically vote, have no idea there's an election next
week." To help voters tune in, state Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine)
wants to move the date of future gubernatorial primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Under a bill he introduced this month, the presidential primary
would remain in March but all other offices would have their primary
the second week of September.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Californians are just not ready to focus on a primary when
the general election is eight months away," said Johnson, who has
carried similar legislation in the past. "It's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said delaying the primary might also compel candidates to
avoid negative advertising--one factor often blamed for the decline
in turnout.</TE>
<TE>   Under today's schedule, a politician can run negative ads in the
primary campaign and count on voters forgetting them by the general
election in November.</TE>
<TE>   "If the two elections were closer in time, people would remember
how a candidate behaved in a primary," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   California used to have a June primary, but both political parties
favored moving it to March as a way to gain clout in the presidential
nominating process.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the primary was held in late March and had virtually no
effect on the presidential contest.</TE>
<TE>   Another bill, in 1998, moved it to early March, and in 2000
President Bush clinched the GOP nomination here.</TE>

<HD>Body Found; Probably Is Missing Girl</HD>
<DH>Search: Volunteers locate remains in a rural area outside San

<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>Volunteer searchers in a remote inland area stumbled across the
body of a young girl Wednesday, and investigators said the remains are
almost certainly those of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam, who disappeared
from her home Feb. 2.</LD>
<LD>   The body was discovered under a small stand of trees, about 30 feet
off a winding two-lane road. The area, about 25 miles northeast of San
Diego and east of El Cajon, is in a rural area known an Dehesa.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego Police cautioned that positive identification of the body
could take several days. But San Diego Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst said, "We
believe that Danielle van Dam's body has been found."</LD>
<TE>   "We hopefully will know what happened to this young girl," he said at
a Wednesday night news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the girl, found lying on her back, is about 4 feet tall
and has blond hair, like Danielle, authorities said. The body bore a
plastic necklace--just like the one Danielle is shown wearing on the
missing-person posters plastered throughout the region, Pfingst said. An
earring matching one Danielle was wearing the night she disappeared is
also visible on one ear.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any other young children reported missing in the
county," said San Diego Police Lt. Jim Collins. "It's a high probability
that it's her."</TE>
<TE>   No murder weapon was near the body, Pfingst said, and investigators
believe the girl was killed elsewhere, then dropped at the site. A cause
of death had not been determined; an autopsy will be conducted this week.</TE>
<TE>   Police were also investigating whether the body was burned, but San
Diego Police Chief David Bejarano said that had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said authorities had no plans to bring Danielle's parents,
Brenda and Damon van Dam, to the site.</TE>
<TE>   The family was inside their home in the Sabre Springs section of San
Diego Wednesday evening with several police detectives and other
supporters. They had no immediate comment on the discovery. Several
neighbors dropped by with food as they got home from work, and a priest,
Father Joseph Acton of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, arrived to help
the Van Dams cope with the news.</TE>
<TE>   "They are devastated by this," Acton said as he left the house. "I
still believe God loves Danielle. My job is to get that message across.
This is an awful, horrible thing. It's going to hurt for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the San Diego Sheriff's Office, which patrols the
area where the body was found, said jurisdiction at the site had been
handed over to the San Diego police.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities brought in searchlights and a long-ladder firetruck
equipped with bright lights to illuminate the area. The volunteers who
found the body were offered counseling. They were asked to stay on the
scene so authorities could record their footprints to differentiate them
from other prints near the body, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say David Alan Westerfield, the man who is charged with
Danielle's kidnapping and murder and is being held without bond in the
San Diego County jail, traveled to inland areas of southeast California
in the days after Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   He was in his motor home, which he then had steam-cleaned before it
could be inspected, they said. Police later discovered traces of blood on
his clothes and inside the motor home, and announced that DNA tests
confirmed the blood was Danielle's. If the body is burned, Collins said,
that would not necessarily preclude the possibility of additional DNA
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of volunteers searched San Diego and Imperial counties and
portions of Mexico since Danielle disappeared. There was no particular
evidence that drew them to the site near El Cajon, Collins said, and
police were stunned--and thankful--that the body was discovered in such a
vast, remote area.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a judge released seven search warrants showing that
police have scoured Westerfield's home since Danielle disappeared,
looking for children's pajamas and Mickey Mouse earrings.</TE>
<TE>   Police were also looking for "binding materials," according to one of
the search warrants, issued Feb. 14 at the request of the San Diego
Police Department. Those materials, the document says, could include
"leather or rope necklaces or collars."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle was not in her bed when her parents went to wake her on the
morning of Feb. 2 and had not been seen since. Police immediately focused
on Westerfield, 50, as a suspect, and he has since been charged with
murder, kidnapping and possession of child pornography. Westerfield
pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorney, Steven Feldman, did not return phone calls
Wednesday. Neither Liz Purcell, a spokeswoman for the San Diego County
district attorney's office, nor Dave Cohen, a spokesman for the San Diego
Police Department, would discuss the documents Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to discuss what is in those search warrants," Cohen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have searched Westerfield's two-story red-roofed house,
two doors from Danielle's home, at least three times, the first on Feb.
5.</TE>
<TE>   According to the documents, investigators wanted to make records of
all of Westerfield's shoes, look at undeveloped film, search drain traps
for hair and blood and seize "diaries or letters relating to juvenile
abduction."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the searching in Westerfield's home appeared to focus on
suspicions that he possessed child pornography, the documents suggest.
One of the warrants gave investigators permission to search Westerfield's
computer for images "depicting nudity and/or sexual activities involving
juveniles, juveniles with juveniles, and juveniles or adults."</TE>
<TE>   Three other warrants allowed investigators to listen to Westerfield's
phone calls in the days after Danielle's disappearance, a time during
which investigators believe Westerfield drove his 35-foot motor home into
the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were also given permission--with the consent of
Danielle's parents--to trace all phone calls that came into the Van Dams'
home after Feb. 12. The Van Dams gave their permission, one search
warrant says, to assist in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a warrant issued Feb. 7 gave investigators the right to
search a cleaning business in Poway.</TE>
<TE>   The documents were released by San Diego County Superior Court Judge
Cynthia Bashant, acting on a request by Copley Press, the publisher of
the San Diego Union-Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, search warrants are considered public documents
after they are executed unless there is sufficient reason to keep them
sealed.</TE>

<HD>Not So Fast, T. Rex ! Theory Slows Toothy Tyrant to Trot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was big, and he was mean. But was he fast?</LD>
<LD>   For years, scientists--and movie makers--have speculated about the top
speed of Tyrannosaurus rex, the fearsome predator of the Cretaceous. Some
paleontologists have theorized the creature could gallop after its prey
at 25, 30, even 45 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Slow down, say a pair of researchers.</LD>
<TE>   Using computerized biomechanical models, the two scientists,
specialists in biomechanics, have reduced T. rex to no more than a
trotter. To actually run, according to their studies, which are published
in the journal Nature, an animal as big and heavy as the Tyrannosaurus
would need leg muscles so massive they might make up as much as 86% of
its body mass--leaving little room for lungs, a skeleton or much of
anything else. Typically no more than 50% of an animal's body mass is
composed of muscle and usually only 5% to 40% is allocated to the legs.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers John R. Hutchinson and Mariano Garcia used a mathematical
model and information from dinosaurs' living relatives--birds--to
determine how much muscle would be necessary for T. rex to achieve a fast
run. Hutchinson, now at Stanford and Garcia, now at Borg-Warner
Automotive, performed the research while both were at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Early assumptions about dinosaur speed were often made based on
physical similarities to living animals--if ornithomimus looked like an
ostrich, it must run as fast as one.</TE>
<TE>   Other methods to determine top speeds were hampered by holes in the
fossil record.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists, for example, have calculated speeds based on
fossilized footprints. A paper published in Nature last month clocked
megalosaurus, a large European dinosaur, at 8 meters per second (roughly
18 mph), said Neill Alexander, a researcher at the University of Leeds in
Britain who specializes in animal and human movement. He first developed
the formula for calculating speed from footprints in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   But footprints are few and far between. Only one known T. rex
footprint exists, Hutchinson said, making it impossible to estimate the
speed of the giant dinosaurs that way.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the realm of what is physically possible in terms of scale
may be a better way of attacking the problem, Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "If an animal is going to move a certain speed its muscles need to
generate enough force to maintain that speed," Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Muscle strength is not proportional to body size; in fact, just the
contrary. The strength of a muscle depends on its length and width, but
the mass of an animal depends on three dimensions: length, width and
height. If one animal is twice the size of another, its muscles would be
four times stronger, but its mass would be eight times greater. In
proportion to body size, the smaller animal would be much stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "Ants can lift things two times their body weight for essentially the
same reason that T. rex couldn't run," said Tom Roberts, a biomechanist
at Oregon State University.</TE>
<TE>   "The dramatic effect of scaling"--the way strength and weight change
as the scale of an animal's body increases--"simply makes it hard to
build a vertebrate animal this size that could run," said Andrew
Biewener, a scientist at Harvard University who published a response to
Hutchinson's paper in the same issue of Nature.</TE>
<TE>Chicken Legs and Alligators Yield Clues</TE>
<TE>   To calculate the amount of force needed to produce a fast run,
Hutchinson and Garcia developed stick-figure models of the animals. The
models allowed them to visualize all the rotational forces that acted on
the dinosaur's joints. Once they calculated the force needed for the
dinosaur to balance itself, they calculated how much more force would be
needed for it to run. They based their calculations on the knowledge that
animals, from ants to horses, generally need to produce about 2 1/2 times
more force to run than they do to support themselves while standing
still.</TE>
<TE>   Once they calculated the required force, their models allowed the two
researchers to estimate the minimum amount of muscle mass the dinosaur
would need.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson and Garcia first confirmed the validity of their model by
using its estimates to calculate the minimum muscle mass needed for
chickens and alligators to run.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens, like humans and other good runners, have more leg muscle
than the model indicates they absolutely need in order to run--about 17%
of body mass. Alligators, which are not strong runners, have half the
estimated minimum leg muscle needed to run well--about 7%.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also rebut another assumption about T. rex: its
posture.</TE>
<TE>   In science fiction depictions and elsewhere, the dinosaur is typically
pictured running in a crouched position, Hutchinson said. But larger
animals are able to support their weight more easily in an upright
position than in a crouch--a principle that anyone who has stood in place
for a long time can understand.</TE>
<TE>   "You straighten your legs because it requires the least exertion," he
said. "The muscles need to be tensed to maintain a crouched posture."</TE>
<TE>   Using their models, Hutchinson and Garcia tested a number of different
postures and a variety of speeds.</TE>
<TE>It Might Have Feasted on Predeceased Prey</TE>
<TE>   For T. Rex, the crouched running positions all required too much leg
muscle to be feasible. And even standing straight, a speed faster than 25
mph would require an untenable amount of muscle mass in the leg, they
found.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what posture we put in, there was no way a Tyrannosaur
could run 45 miles an hour," Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Even a 25-mph top speed seems unlikely, he said. To hold the muscle
mass to no more than 16% to 20% of the animal's total would require a
posture so upright that it would be difficult for the dinosaur to walk,
Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   A further implication of the work: If T. Rex could not chase down its
prey, it is possible, some paleontologists say, that the creature
actually got much of its food not by predation, but by eating carrion. On
the other hand, Hutchinson said, many dinosaurs that were possible T. Rex
victims, such as triceratops, would also be hindered by their own bulk.</TE>
<TE>   To further emphasize their point, Hutchinson and Garcia studied the
mechanics of a chicken scaled up to the size of a T. rex.</TE>
<TE>   The gigantic chicken would need to have more than 99% of its body mass
composed of leg muscle to produce enough force for it to run--a physical
impossibility, although perhaps a dream for lovers of dark meat.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the new information will change the movies remains to be seen.
By now, T. rex is "also a movie actor, and you see human actors doing
things normal humans can't do, if a director wants it that way," said Ken
Bryan, a modeling supervisor for Industrial Light &amp; Magic, which handled
the animations for the "Jurassic Park" movies, among others.</TE>
<TE>   But at least the movie makers will be well informed. On the strength
of his research, Hutchinson served as an informal consultant for
"Jurassic Park 3."</TE>

<HD>Modest Donor Squeezed Out of Governor's Race</HD>
<DH>Politics: Campaign critics say ordinary citizens are put off by
dominance of big givers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the debate over the millions of dollars being spent by the
candidates for governor of California during this year's primary
election, one aspect of the campaign's finances has gone largely
unnoticed: the virtual elimination of the modest donor.</LD>
<LD>   Once a bulwark of political participation, the engaged citizen who
gives $10, $20, even a few hundred dollars has become an anachronism in a
race that has seen the ascendance of big money.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and Bill Simon Jr. each have averaged more than $5,000
per contribution in their campaigns--in Simon's case, those numbers
include millions he has lent to himself. Richard Riordan has averaged
about $4,000 per donation.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, former Gov. Pete Wilson won reelection in 1994 when more
than 28,000 people donated to his campaign. His average donation in that
campaign was less than $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures play out against the national debate over campaign
finance reform, and supporters of new contribution limits cite the
changing character of donations--along with the staggering amounts
raised--as evidence of the need for change.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, it is a major factor contributing to the disengagement
and alienation of people from the political process," said Jim Knox,
executive director of California Common Cause. "The message the voters
get is that their contributions don't matter."</TE>
<TE>   With no legal limit on the size of contributions in this year's
gubernatorial race, the bulk of the money fueling the campaigns of both
parties is coming from a small circle of big-ticket donors. It includes
corporations, associations such as labor unions, and wealthy friends and
family members of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The leading candidates of both parties have benefited, but Democrat
Davis has amassed more money from fewer people than any of his three
Republican challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Relentlessly courting big money since the day he took office, Davis
raised $28.4 million in 2000 and 2001 alone from fewer than 5,000 donors,
an average of nearly $6,000 per donation. More than 90% of Davis' money
came in contributions of $5,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The two leading Republican challengers--both multimillionaires who are
tapping their business connections for help--also are heavily reliant on
big money.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, whose $9.3 million in contributions leads the Republican
field, has averaged more than $4,000 per contribution through
mid-February. Over that same period, Simon lent his own campaign $3.7
million and raised $700,000 more from his family. (Last Wednesday, he
lent himself another $1 million.) Simon's average contribution is more
than $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves little room for donors such as Shirley R. Freedland, an
82-year-old retired speech therapist. Although she thinks of herself as a
"dyed-in-the-wool Democrat," she liked Pete Wilson as governor, so she
sent a $50 check to his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, she's sent Davis two checks totaling $150.</TE>
<TE>   Helped by contributors such as Freedland, Wilson built a huge
grass-roots base of fund-raising support. As a sitting governor, he too
raised millions of dollars, but he relied on a much larger pool of
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' chief political strategist, Garry South, said the campaign has
worked to build a base of small contributors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been doing telemarketing since the fall of 1998," South said.
"We have done direct mail. We do fund-raising through the Web site."</TE>
<TE>   He said the effort has brought in 18,000 donations of under $100. Even
so, the impact on the campaign has been nearly negligible.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports filed with the secretary of state, Davis had less
than $500,000 in donations under $100 during 2000 and 2001, about 1.7% of
his total. Wilson recorded nearly $1.3 million in contributions of under
$100, about 4.6% of his total.</TE>
<TE>   South called the comparison to Wilson unfair because the former U.S.
senator ran two campaigns under the $1,000 federal contribution limit
before his race for governor. Davis has never run for federal office and
so has built his contributor base under California's rules, which have
changed over time but today do not impose any limits on contributions in
the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, the 2002 gubernatorial campaign promises to be the last
gasp of unrestricted political fund-raising in California. The next
election will be governed by Proposition 34, the 2000 statewide
initiative that set a $20,000 limit on contributions for governor.</TE>
<TE>Law Exempted Race for Governor</TE>
<TE>   All legislative races currently fall under even lower limits
established by the proposition, but the gubernatorial campaign does not
because the law, authored by state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco),
exempted it.</TE>
<TE>   South suggested that even when the new limits imposed by Proposition
34 take effect, small donors will not suddenly become a force.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a total myth for anyone to suggest that . . . if you just
ratchet the fund-raising limits down to an extreme level you are going to
force these candidates to go out and raise millions of dollars from $10
donations," South said. "No matter how beneficial someone might think
that would be for democracy, it is not realistic, not practical and not
cost-effective. That is why no one is out there doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Though they disagree with South about the reasons, some political
reform advocates also are skeptical that the new limits in gubernatorial
campaigns will restore the position of the small political giver.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is too high," said Robert M. Stern, president of the Los
Angeles-based Center for Governmental Studies, a nonprofit group that
monitors campaign reform around the country. "It still allows
contributions up to $20,000, which is much higher than most states and
much higher than the federal law which applies to the president and
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, the money paying for California elections today
comes from institutional givers--the kind Stern describes as "afraid not
to give." They are unions representing workers on the state payroll or on
state-funded construction. They are businesses concerned about workers'
compensation reform. They are telecommunications companies subject to
state regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Often they give to both parties and even to opponents in the same
race. Among at least 200 institutions and individuals that gave both to
Wilson and Davis were Health Net, AT&amp;T, the Wine Institute and the
California Building Industry Council.</TE>
<TE>   On average, these donors gave 58% more to Davis than they had to
Wilson eight years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Several of them refused to speak about their political gifts. Others
spoke only in generalities about why they give.</TE>
<TE>   "We support candidates who are reasonable when it comes to our
industry," said Health Net spokeswoman Lisa Haines. "It doesn't mean they
always agree with us. But when they don't, they disagree reasonably."</TE>
<TE>   Political donors are especially tight-lipped about how they decide
whom to give to and how much to give.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say from our standpoint, action by a government official is
never tied to the amount of money you give," said Jennifer Kent, director
of government and external affairs for the California Optometric Assn.,
which gave Wilson $48,450 but scaled back its contributions to Davis to
$30,000. "We don't equate the two. Our giving has nothing to do with what
we seek in the Legislature. They are two completely separate activities."</TE>
<TE>   Kent said the escalating gifts merely reflect inflation.</TE>
<TE>   But some insiders say that pressure from the candidates themselves
pushes up the level of giving.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to maximize the candidate's time by setting up personal
contacts that will bring in the most money, said John Plaxco, who once
raised money for former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), but now practices his craft in private
philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   "To get the governor to show up for something, there needs to be a
certain amount of money they're going to be able to raise," Plaxco said.
"A lot of times a campaign will set their internal benchmark to determine
what's going to justify taking out an hour and a half of the candidate's
time. Time is really the critical factor. There's a real deadline. There
are only so many days. There's a lot of competition for this person's
time to do all kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   Despite those constraints, Plaxco said he encouraged his candidates to
make the effort to widen their donor bases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a politically smart thing to do," he said. "To raise a million
in small contributions of 15 to 25 bucks is a lot of people. It will
bring your average down. You get less a percentage of your money from
wealthy people."</TE>
<TE>   But building a wide base of small donors is laborious and
unpredictable, said George Gordon, the consultant who ran Wilson's
campaigns. It takes expensive mailings that can backfire if war or
natural disaster turns donors' attention elsewhere. And it requires
grass-roots organizing that becomes more difficult each year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, at Wilson's insistence, Gordon pulled together a
statewide organization with a committee in each county that kept the
small donations trickling in.</TE>
<TE>People Want to Be Involved</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to energize the smaller donor," Gordon said. "Bottom line,
it's not money but votes. People want to be involved in campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   And any politician who spurns that desire risks turning off voters
like Ed Friendly, who says he gives out of a begrudging sense of duty.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the fact that all these candidates have to raise this money to
run for office," Friendly said. "I think it's indecent. But it's an
unfortunate fact of life."</TE>
<TE>   The political contributions of Friendly, the retired producer of
"Laugh-In" and "Little House on the Prairie," make him about an average
giver to the current campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   He gave Wilson $5,000. Then he gave Davis $5,000 for his first
election campaign. But now he's switched loyalty. He memorialized his
support for Riordan with a $2,000 check last November.</TE>
<TE>   Friendly said he harbors no illusions about what it will get him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no access," he said. "I don't have enough money to have an
impact on the campaign with Gray Davis spending most of his time raising
money. That's one of the reasons I gave to Richard Riordan."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Cheney Panel's Files Released</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling opens a new path to details of secret U.S. energy
policy meetings that the vice president had sought to suppress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Department of Energy to
release documents that could shed light on secret meetings between Vice
President Dick Cheney's energy task force and industry officials, saying
the records were in "extraordinary public interest."</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, issued Feb. 21 and made public Wednesday, requires the
government to make available thousands of pages related to meetings held
last year as President Bush was developing his national energy plan.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous lawmakers, including Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles),
suspect that the meetings may reveal that industry leaders, including
officials of the now-bankrupt Enron Corp., had significant input into
shaping the policy.</LD>
<TE>   Energy Department officials said Wednesday that they would comply with
the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said we would comply and have worked diligently to do
so," said Energy Department spokeswoman Jill Schroeder.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman declined comment, referring reporters to the
Energy Department statement.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed in December by the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental organization. It seeks much of the same
information as a landmark suit filed last week against Cheney himself by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Despite pleas from some Republicans, Cheney has steadfastly refused to
release the records, saying that the president has the right to keep the
information private and warning that disclosure might hinder the
president's ability to gather unvarnished opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said last week that if necessary they would
invoke "executive privilege" to maintain the confidentiality of Cheney's
records.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents dating back to George Washington have employed this
doctrine to withhold information from Congress or the judiciary. By
targeting the Energy Department rather than the vice president, the
council skirted this issue.</TE>
<TE>   The council's Freedom of Information Act request applies only to
records involving Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham or other department
staff members. But since the department played a large role in the task
force, it is expected that the documents will be similar to those sought
under the GAO suit.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the department to release
the records in two batches, on March 25 and April 10.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the council first requested the documents in April 2001,
Kessler chastised the department for its "woefully tardy" response.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to having no legal or practical justification for working
at a glacial pace on [the council's request] until the suit was filed in
December, the material which [the council] seeks is of extraordinary
public interest," she wrote, noting that Congress is expected to take up
sweeping energy legislation as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a devastating defeat for the administration and another sign
that their position is weak and they're not going to prevail," said Phil
Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing White House refusal to release details of its energy
task force's inner workings has caused deep consternation among
Republicans, who fear the political fallout from the perception that
Cheney has something to hide.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits have also put a bright spotlight on the administration's
close ties to Texas energy executives; both Bush and Cheney have
backgrounds in the energy business. And the standoff over the release of
information has become even more sensitive for the Bush administration in
recent months because of the collapse of Houston-based Enron, one of the
nation's largest energy companies and a major supporter of Bush's
presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has acknowledged that Cheney or members of the task
force met six times last year with representatives of Enron, but it has
refused to release other details.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the Energy department had informed the court that it would
release the records between March 15 and May 15. Schroeder, the
department spokeswoman, said the release was delayed because the
department had to sort through more than 7,000 pages of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the council accused the department of "stonewalling."</TE>
<TE>   "We ran out of patience and the judge ran out of patience," said
Sharon Buccino, senior attorney at the council. She said she expects the
records to include the names of participants at task force meetings,
dates and topics discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Buccino predicted that the records will reveal heavy lobbying by
energy industry interests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a policy that benefits Enron and other energy companies while
doing nothing to promote true energy independence," Buccino said,
referring to Bush's May 2001 energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the GAO could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   But Buccino said the GAO suit remains important because it may uncover
additional meetings that did not include Energy Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington today, another federal judge will hear arguments in a
similar lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, a watchdog legal group that is
seeking the same records from Cheney.</TE>

<HD>North Should Talk With U.S., Says S. Korea's Kim</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: In interview, president expresses frustration with
regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>South Korean President Kim Dae Jung urged North Korea on Wednesday
to accept President Bush's offer of a dialogue and to live up to earlier
promises made to South Korea before the window of opportunity for
negotiations closes.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with The Times, his first with the foreign press since
last week's meeting here with Bush, Kim offered unusually blunt words
about North Korea. Normally eager not to offend the famously thin-skinned
regime in Pyongyang, he expressed clear frustration with its
foot-dragging.</LD>
<LD>   "The North must make a decision. It is their choice," said Kim, who
won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to engage the Communist North in
dialogue. "We believe the Bush administration is sincere about wanting a
dialogue. It is in the best interest of North Korea to pursue it."</LD>
<TE>   Kim also said there are no substantial differences of opinion between
him and Bush on the subject of North Korea, although he admitted he had
been taken aback to hear Bush brand North Korea as part of an "axis of
evil" along with Iraq and Iran. "When I first heard this quote, I fully
understood what he meant," he said. "But with regard to that particular
wording, it was unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   Offering behind-the-scenes insight on how the two leaders had bridged
what had appeared to be a gaping chasm between the United States and
South Korea, Kim said he reminded Bush that President Reagan had once
labeled the Soviet Union an "evil empire" but kept the door open for a
dialogue that eventually was successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I understand fully why the North Korean leadership is not
very likable, it is in the interests of global peace to pursue the policy
of dialogue," Kim said he told Bush. "I did not fail to point out that we
are not naive about North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has indignantly rejected any dialogue with the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly infuriated by Bush's criticism during his Seoul trip of North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the official newspaper Rodong Shinmun reported
Wednesday that North Korea "does not feel any need to have such a useless
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has been denouncing Bush with increasingly virulent
language over the past week--at one point calling him "a politically
backward child"--but has refrained from any criticism of South Korea. To
veteran North Korea watchers, this is a sign that North Korea is on the
verge of reopening the dialogue with South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "This augurs a very positive development which I think will come
soon," Kim Dae Jung said in the interview. But he said that negotiations
between the Koreas alone will not accomplish much without the
participation of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "What North Korea wants to achieve most is the stability of their
system and economic recovery," he said. "The United States is the only
country that can guarantee these."</TE>
<TE>   Playing the role of elder statesman and historian, the 77-year-old Kim
said he also spoke to Bush about the devastation of the 1950-1953 Korean
War.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are worried about is that if a war broke out in Korea,
everything we built over the past 50 years will be reduced to ashes," Kim
recalled telling Bush.</TE>
<TE>   He said that by the end of Bush's 40-hour visit to South Korea, which
included a trip to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea,
"President Bush did not change his view of the North Korean leadership at
all, but he was very enthusiastic about dialogue. . . . He understood the
South Korean people do not want a war at any cost."</TE>
<TE>   As for South Korea, Kim said his government fully understands and
supports the United States' concerns that North Korea is developing
weapons of mass destruction and exporting dangerous missile technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue of North Korean weapons of mass destruction must be
resolved. . . . It must be resolved through dialogue," said Kim, who
reiterated his commitment to working closely with the United States,
which maintains 37,000 soldiers in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The interview took place in the Blue House, the presidential residence
in Seoul, through an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's acclaimed "sunshine policy" sent hopes soaring for a
rapprochement between the estranged Koreas. Breaking the ice after 50
years of estrangement, Kim traveled in June 2000 to Pyongyang for a
landmark meeting with North Korea's Kim. In October of that year,
then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited North Korea, and it
looked as if the Clinton administration or a Democratic successor would
soon establish relations with the isolated regime.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush rejected President Clinton's approach, adopting a tougher
line. An initial meeting at the White House last year with South Korea's
Kim ended in embarrassment after Bush publicly disparaged the sunshine
policy. Whether as a result or not, the dialogue between North and South
Korea stalled shortly afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his last year in office and barred by the constitution from
seeking another term, Kim is clearly worried that time is running out.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show opposition leader Lee Hoi Chang, a critic of the sunshine
policy, running a solid 10 percentage points ahead of any candidate from
Kim's party. Borrowing a line from Israeli statesman Abba Eban about the
Palestinians, many Korea analysts are saying lately that the North
Koreans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, although excruciatingly careful not to offend North Korea, is
increasingly outspoken in his frustration.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, he enumerated the many commitments that Pyongyang
hasn't honored: The heart-wrenching reunions of separated Korean families
stopped a year ago. The North Koreans have balked at promises to rebuild
their share of the railroad and highway that would link up the Koreas, to
open an industrial complex near the border and to allow South Korean
tourists to cross the DMZ. Kim Jong Il has not yet reciprocated Kim Dae
Jung's trip to Pyongyang with a visit to Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a higher probability that the North Koreans can make some
kind of agreement while I am still president of Korea," Kim said. "That
would at least give them a firm foundation to go forward with the next
government."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that the North Koreans should stop looking backward to
what had happened during the Clinton administration and deal with the
fact that Bush is president. "I believe the North Koreans should pick up
the best offer on the table," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Bush's visit, few in Seoul are predicting that
North Korea will relent on its refusal to talk with the U.S. Although the
Bush administration has said repeatedly that it will meet at any time and
in any place with North Korea, the U.S. president's harsh criticism gave
mixed signals. Among other comments, Bush called North Korea a "despotic
regime."</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat here who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that Bush's trip was a success in smoothing over hurt feelings between
the United States and South Korea but that the insults did little to
advance a dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush did not offer any helpful inducements to coax North Korea off of
its limb," the diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Shin Jung Hyun, a professor at Kyunghee University in Seoul, said: "It
looks like some economic talks will resume between North and South Korea,
maybe the family reunions. But it will be a long time before North Korea
talks with the United States."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's move toward deeper military involvement
in the former Soviet republic of Georgia is the latest demonstration of
how, with a world view reshaped by Sept. 11, the administration is
thrusting America more directly into distant conflicts that have raged
for years.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has long been committed to a stable Georgia, just as
it has been eager to see peace in Colombia and an end to a Muslim
insurgency in the Philippines. But now, citing the threat of terrorism,
the White House has expanded its military advisory role in the Colombian
and Philippine jungles and in the former Soviet Union--a place where any
U.S. military presence would even recently have been unthinkable.</LD>
<LD>   "So long as there's Al Qaeda anywhere, we will help the host countries
root them out and bring them to justice," President Bush said Wednesday
in North Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   Late last year, the Pentagon sent 10 Huey helicopters to Georgia,
which borders Chechnya, where Islamic separatists are fighting Russian
rule. A U.S. military trainer and six U.S. contractors have been in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, since November training Georgian
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials are weighing proposals from military advisory
groups that they make more aggressive moves to pursue militants in
Georgia who, according to what is described as new evidence, may include
members of the Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some indications of connections . . . of Al Qaeda in
that country," Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia has been on the route for Islamic extremists traveling between
Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations and Chechnya. Insurgents from
Chechnya have used the rugged country in transporting supplies and as an
avenue of escape from the Russian military.</TE>
<TE>   Although a direct combat role has been ruled out, the Pentagon may
provide more equipment and step up the use of military trainers in
Georgia. In response to published reports that 100 to 200 U.S. military
advisors might be sent to the country, officials said the needs are still
being assessed.</TE>
<TE>   An escalation of involvement in Georgia comes after the United States
has already established a military presence at bases in the former Soviet
republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. They are part of a
ring of new and expanded military bases established at 13 locations in
nine countries near Afghanistan since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the avowed pursuit of Al Qaeda members around the globe has
the United States closely watching such countries as Somalia, Yemen and
Indonesia, which are among the estimated 60 countries where the terrorist
group is thought to have cells.</TE>
<TE>   Given the strong domestic support for the war on terrorism, these
moves have spurred little open opposition at home. And some analysts
sympathetic to the Bush administration said the U.S. move in Georgia is
in keeping with the assertive stance Bush has taken since the September
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our involvement there is a logical consequence of the new agenda,"
said Gary J. Schmitt, executive director of the Project for a New
American Century, a conservative advocacy group. At the same time,
Schmitt acknowledged that U.S. forces may be required to remain involved
in Georgia for some time, and longer than the Pentagon would like.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as the far-flung deployments mount, even some administration
supporters say these engagements raise questions about how deeply--and
how long--U.S. military forces will be committed in places that have been
far outside the traditional sphere of American influence.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is, how much of a commitment is this going to be?"
said Daniel Goure, a defense analyst and former defense official. "Once
you've seen Tbilisi and [the Uzbek city of] Samarkand, can you ever
leave?"</TE>
<TE>   An influential Democrat, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the chairman
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned Wednesday, "If we expect
to kill every terrorist in the world, that's going to keep us going
beyond doomsday."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been committed to trying to stabilize Georgia
since the Soviet Union fell, hoping that it would serve as a strong
independent counterbalance to Russia, and to supporting the government of
President Eduard A. Shevardnadze.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had economic interests in mind, including an oil
pipeline that they hoped could be built from the Caspian region through
Georgia and Turkey, to provide an alternative to a route through Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue of Islamic militants also loomed large. The Georgian
government has been unable to control the Pankisi Gorge in northeastern
Georgia in the last three years. Chechen fighters, some reportedly with
Al Qaeda links, penetrate the mountainous border freely, particularly in
spring and summer.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities have long claimed that Chechen fighters have ties
to Al Qaeda, for example those linked with a commander named Khattab.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has put intense pressure on Georgia to agree to a Russian
operation to rid the gorge of Chechen separatists, a proposal Georgia
firmly rejected. Nonetheless, Russian planes have bombed northern regions
of Georgia several times in recent years, and recently Russian officials
have claimed that Osama bin Laden was in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. helicopter transfer was first agreed to by the Clinton
administration, said Kenneth Yalowitz, former U.S. ambassador to Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Yalowitz said that as part of the agreement, Georgian pilots have been
training at U.S. military flight schools for two years and U.S. military
personnel have traveled to Georgia to assess the best place to base the
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has also given boots and uniforms to Georgian border guards
patrolling the porous frontier with Chechnya, helped plan military
reforms and provided opportunities for Georgian military officers to
study in the U.S., Yalowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Yalowitz stressed that the new U.S. interest should be seen as "part
of a broader . . . relationship with a country that we want to see
succeed--this is all not just something that comes out of nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he acknowledged that "there is a new element to the
relationship, a new urgency, which has arisen since Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. military delegation of five arrived in Georgia on
Wednesday for talks at the Defense Ministry on plans to train and equip
Georgian forces in anti-terrorist operations. The delegation also visited
late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Russian reaction to the continuing U.S. moves into its border area has
been one of marked ambivalence. Some voices are questioning whether the
U.S. should be moving its troops so close.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said in Moscow on Wednesday
that any U.S. military involvement in Georgia would exacerbate the
complex situation there.</TE>
<TE>   But other Russian officials have signaled their satisfaction with the
move.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Mironov, the speaker of the upper house of Russia's parliament,
the Federation Council, said Wednesday that the presence of U.S. advisors
in Georgia wouldn't harm Russian interests because Russia had long
pointed out the terrorist problem in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Several independent analysts in the United States said the move was
likely to be seen as a victory for the Russian government, which has been
trying to persuade the United States to treat the Chechen insurgents as
terrorists and join its controversial fight against them.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is a win for the United States remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former
National Security Council aide, said he fears that the war on terrorism
is "becoming a grab bag to justify everything [Bush administration
officials] have ever wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   He said he fears that the United States is turning to military
solutions all over the world, much as the country did in the early years
of the fight against communism.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a debate in this country," he said, "because there's a real
possibility we're really overplaying our hands."</TE>

<DH>Police agencies in the U.S., faced with rapidly thinning ranks, get
creative to recruit. The tactics include personal visits and such perks
as taking cruisers home.</DH>

<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Police Chief Andrew J. Scott III carries a badge and a gun. And a
pizza, if that's what it takes these days to get his man or woman.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, however, Scott has his hands free as he arrives at dusk at a
home in the Palm Beach County community of Boynton Beach. Standing in the
driveway is the man Scott is looking for, a security guard named Jim
Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Scott hasn't come to slap the cuffs on Brown but to meet the
38-year-old former Coast Guardsman, his family and a colleague from work
over dinner and deliver an in-person pitch on why he should apply for a
job at the Boca Raton Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to see you, eyeball to eyeball," Scott, spiffily turned out in
his Class A dress blues, tells Brown. "I want you to know that my
investment in you is going to be $100,000, and I want to get that back."</TE>
<TE>   Although the prestige of law enforcement arguably has never been
higher because of the courage and devotion of police officers on Sept.
11, finding men and women to wear the uniform and risk their lives to
enforce the law has never been more problematic for many of the country's
18,000 police departments.</TE>
<TE>   Because of multiple factors--the large cohort of Vietnam War veterans
now retiring, more stringent educational requirements, better-paying jobs
in the private sector--America's thin blue line has never seemed thinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know any police department that can say right now: 'We've got
enough people,' " said Officer Jack Richter, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles Police Department. The LAPD, which has an authorized strength of
10,196 sworn personnel, has 8,910 officers.</TE>
<TE>   If any city should have experienced a surge in applications since
Sept. 11, it would be New York. But the number of candidates there who
signed up to take the entry exam has actually dropped in the last year.
Meanwhile, the number of retiring officers soared by 87%. For Raymond W.
Kelly, the new police commissioner, replenishing the ranks is a priority,
and New York's finest are hardly alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been much more of a challenge over the last decade as police
everywhere have struggled with trying to recruit a new generation and
filling the ranks of the people who have been in policing 20 to 25 years
and are now getting ready to retire," said Elaine Deck, project
coordinator at the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, a
professional organization based in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   To help the nation's smaller police departments, Deck runs seminars on
how to recruit and train personnel. "Everyone is going back to square one
to see how to promote police work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Sunnyvale, Calif., the public safety department now tries to entice
candidates by promising them training and jobs as both police officers
and firefighters, with assignments on a rotating basis. Like many law
enforcement agencies today, the Beaufort County, S.C., sheriff's office
lets employees take their cruisers home and pays a $1,200 bonus for
recruits who speak Spanish well.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, Commissioner Kelly has said he will ask the state
Legislature to allow his officers to get some retirement benefits while
still working, in hopes that will staunch the outflow.</TE>
<TE>   One unscientific but informative barometer for the employment
situation can be found in the pages of American Police Beat, the
largest-circulation newspaper for police officers. Donna Markussen, who
works in advertising sales, reports only a "slight drop" since Sept. 11
in the number of ads placed by departments looking to hire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a bad scenario for most agencies," said Markussen,
speaking from the monthly's offices in Cambridge, Mass. "They can't get
enough applicants." Departments are so chronically hungry for people that
some, including the Louisiana State Police and the Seattle Police, have
been buying ads for three years straight, she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the new complications, say specialists, is that Generation
Xers, unlike the stereotypically rumpled police sergeants and detectives
of TV and moviedom, are not ready to toil for years on modest salaries in
exchange for a pension two decades or more down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to front-load the benefits and raise the level of salaries
to get the more educated person," said Sgt. Steven Brancazio, in charge
of hiring and training in Boca Raton. This year, Boca Raton raised the
starting salary of its officers by more than $3,000, to $37,980. Despite
the boost, and plenty of other benefits, the 162-person department has
nine openings.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference with the Generation Xers is, when I came on I was
grateful to have a job," said Scott, who has nearly a quarter-century of
experience in police work. "The new generation wants higher pay, more
benefits and will quickly go to another organization for $1,000 more a
year."</TE>
<TE>   Potential recruits these days also want to hone their skills to be
able to earn more or advance in their careers. Which is why some
departments, such as that of Arlington, Texas, are offering to reimburse
their officers' college tuition expenses as an employment sweetener.</TE>
<TE>   Though educational and other hiring criteria have gotten tougher, the
salaries offered by some municipalities have lagged significantly behind
many would-be officers' expectations. According to the police chiefs
association, entry-level salaries now average $29,000 to $32,000, but
drop to as low as $20,000 in poor rural communities.</TE>
<TE>   Among the consequences: Some police jobs in Oklahoma have been vacant
for more than a year. In Arkansas, some officers apply for food stamps to
make ends meet for their families. In Illinois, communities have reported
a steady eight-year decline in the volume of applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, police departments now "want somebody who has a higher
educational background, as opposed to somebody just coming out of high
school, like years ago," said Markussen of American Police Beat. "When
you have this education, you expect to get paid for it, and they're not."</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, a program called COPS
(Community-Oriented Policing Services) gave money to local departments to
help them hire more officers. The program has taken a major hit in the
budget proposed by the Bush White House, which wants to cut the funding
for new hires by $370 million. The Justice Department contends the
open-ended goal of COPS--100,000 additional officers--has been met and
that the money can be better spent elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Top police officials acknowledge that, with the continuing threat of
terrorism, there are new national requirements in law enforcement--for
example, a federal force to guarantee security at U.S. airports. But they
contend no institution is more vital in safeguarding Americans' lives and
property than their departments and that many need continuing federal
assistance to add people or purchase modern crime-fighting and
communications equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of what happened on 9/11, our priorities as a country have
changed," said Bill Berger, chief of the North Miami Beach Police
Department and president of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police.
"But the people who are going to attempt to harm Americans in the future
are probably going to be apprehended by local police, not federal. The
first line of homeland defense, after terrorists get past the borders,
are the men and women of state and local police."</TE>
<TE>   For Boca Raton, which recently lost 35 of its officers to early
retirement, recruiting has come to mean going after potential police
officers the same way top colleges hunt for athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Scott will drive to candidates' homes, meet their families over
dinner and answer questions posed by parents, spouses, children or
friends. If need be, the chief will even bring pizza.</TE>
<TE>   The innovative approach, paid for by a local civic-minded company, was
the idea of a self-defined "loose cannon" of the advertising trade, Stan
Cotton. He believes that to recruit good police officers, you have to
recruit their families as well.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more willing to send a child to Bosnia or Afghanistan than
to see him become a neighborhood policeman," Cotton maintains. And he
thinks the task of recruiting has gotten harder, not easier, since Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of new security demands in every city, corporation and bus
station has drained the people who otherwise would have been cops,"
Cotton said.</TE>
<TE>   To get the Boca Raton brass and an applicant's family together in a
relaxed setting, Cotton came up with a "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"
advertisement that's been published in area newspapers. It introduces the
46-year-old Scott, alerts job candidates that he's available for a
"heart-to-heart" chat over dinner at their home and adds that if they're
nervous about cooking, they can just tell the chief to "bring takeout."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, though, Brown and his wife, Connie, are providing the meal.
Arrayed on the kitchen counter, there's fried chicken from a supermarket
deli, baked beans, potato salad, deviled eggs and a chocolate cake that
Connie Brown's mother, Anna Friend, 77, made from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Judah, 10, one of three orphans the Browns adopted from Russia, buzzes
excitedly around Scott and Brancazio as soon as the strangers in blue
have crossed the threshold. Asked by the boy to explain what he does,
Scott says he's "kind of like a general."</TE>
<TE>   Their plates piled with food, the adults repair to the dining room.
Brother-in-law Craig Evans, 54, and uncle Randy Gailey, 51, who are there
to lend Brown moral support, also take their seats. So does Warren
Perris, 33, a colleague from work who also is interested in becoming a
policeman.</TE>
<TE>   Brown tells Scott his heart has been in law enforcement since high
school and that in the Coast Guard he spent eight years on drug
interdiction missions. He's not making enough money as a security guard,
"and I've got a big family to support." He could have taken a job with
the Florida Highway Patrol, Brown says, but he couldn't take six months
away from home to attend training.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect a very good and hard day's work for a good day's pay," Scott
replies between bites. "I don't want drones. I want someone who is
creatively addressing the problems affecting the citizenry."</TE>
<TE>   Connie Brown assures the chief she doesn't worry when her husband
comes home late from work. She's been listening to Scott describe the
kind of officer he wants to hire, she says, "and I'm sitting here saying,
'That's Jim.' "</TE>
<TE>   The question of danger comes up. "I've been in the business for 24
years, and I'm pretty much unscathed," Scott replies. Later, the chief
notes that the question of risk on the job is one that was never raised
in traditional police job interviews. He even wants to know whether
Brown's three children know what he might be getting into.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ads encouraging would-be officers to invite Scott for dinner
were printed Dec. 7, Boca Raton police have received 330 telephone
inquiries and 35 dinner invitations. The contacts have led to the hiring
of one police officer and seven people now working as dispatchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, the campaign has been overwhelmingly successful," says
Scott, who finds the get-togethers help him judge how deep a candidate's
commitment is to becoming a cop. Brown, who has filled out an application
and is now awaiting the results of a check into his background, seems
just as enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "It lit a fire in me" to join, he says.</TE>

<HD>Aid Groups Find Rampant Child Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Africa: Relief workers routinely exploit young refugees, agencies
report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>The mother of seven children living in a Liberian refugee camp
faced a stark choice: Watch her family starve, or let her young daughter
be sexually abused by humanitarian aid workers in exchange for the very
food rations, medicines and relief supplies sent to save their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Her choice was a matter of survival, she said.</LD>
<LD>   "When the food finishes, my youngest child keeps crying and pulling on
my skirt," the mother said. "What do you think you can do if your
daughter brings you some?"</LD>
<TE>   A report released this week by the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees revealed that sexual exploitation of children
by aid workers had become rampant in many West African refugee camps.
Relief workers routinely demanded sex in return for items such as plastic
sheeting, bars of soap or a few biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   "The very people who are meant to be providing services are the
exploiters themselves," Jane Gibril, a top official with the Save the
Children charity told the British Broadcasting Corp. in Monrovia,
Liberia's war-torn capital.</TE>
<TE>   The London-based charity--which was among the 40 humanitarian aid
groups, including the U.N. refugee agency and the U.N. peacekeeping
mission in neighboring Sierra Leone, implicated in the scandal--announced
that it had fired a staff member and two volunteers for sexually
exploiting children.</TE>
<TE>   News of the widespread sexual abuse shook the United Nations, which
was recently embarrassed by accusations that peacekeepers under its
command in the Balkans were involved in the trafficking of women for
international prostitution rings.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered "that these
allegations be investigated as thoroughly and urgently as possible."
Saying he was "shocked and disturbed" at the report, he pledged to "act
forcefully should any of these allegations be confirmed."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Children's Fund director Carol Bellamy said Wednesday that her
agency "takes very seriously the findings of the report." She noted that
UNICEF had adopted a zero-tolerance policy toward the sexual abuse of
children by its staff, and she urged other U.N. agencies and
nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, to adopt similar policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are particularly outraged that some humanitarian [aid] workers
have betrayed the trust of the children they are charged to assist and
protect," Bellamy said.</TE>
<TE>   Save the Children and the UNHCR teamed up in October to investigate
widespread allegations that refugee camps in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone had become cesspools of sexual exploitation targeting children. On
Tuesday, the agencies released a report of their initial findings--but
only after the BBC broke the story.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which was prepared after interviews with more than 1,500
children and adults, states that "sexual violence and exploitation of
children appears to be extensive in the communities visited and involves
actors at all levels--U.N. staff, security forces, staff of international
and national NGOs, government officials and community leaders."</TE>
<TE>   "The report indicates that it is a relatively prosperous
'elite'--including U.N. staff, peacekeepers and NGO workers--whose
resources are considerably more than those of the refugees, who exploit
this extreme disparity surrounding the refugee population," the UNHCR and
Save the Children said in their summary of the report's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "Exploiters appear to be able to pay for sex when and with whom they
want, and to do so with impunity, since the very people they exploit are
not able to complain about their situation for fear of their source of
basic survival being removed."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators recorded allegations against 67 individuals belonging to
40 relief groups. No individuals or groups were identified because a U.N.
investigation was continuing, a U.N. spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The report is replete with accounts by children who said they were
forced to have sex with relief workers to get basic humanitarian aid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to escape the trap of those [NGO] people," the report
quotes a "Liberian adolescent" as saying. "They use the food as bait to
get you to [have] sex with them."</TE>
<TE>   Refugee women in Guinea told investigators that "in this community no
one can access CSB [a soy nutrient] without having sex first. They say,
'A kilo for sex.' "</TE>
<TE>   "The stories corroborate each other," Kris Janowski, a spokesman for
the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva, said Wednesday. "It adds up to a very
sad picture."</TE>
<TE>   The sex-for-food allegation is the second recent scandal to rock the
refugee agency, which is entrusted to provide emergency shelter, food,
water and medicine to the world's uprooted people.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, U.N. investigators said the refugee agency was partly
to blame for a racket in which UNHCR staff members in Nairobi, the Kenyan
capital, extorted up to $50 million from thousands of African refugees
seeking resettlement in Europe and North America.</TE>
<TE>   "These are two different cases in which corrupt . . . officials were
abusing their positions of power," Janowski said. "'It shows that a lot
more surveillance and a lot more discipline of staff is needed."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims in the sex-for-food cases are girls, but some boys
are targeted by female aid workers, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The victims said some relief workers would withhold services until the
children had sex with them. Children who refused to have sex were sent to
the back of food lines. Many times, children were told that "your name is
not on the list" or that "the computer swallowed your card" when they
refused to comply with the demands, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Many victims said they didn't realize they were entitled to food
rations and other benefits without conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The refugees subjected to sexual exploitation already endure harsh
lives in ramshackle camps. The vast majority survived brutal civil wars
in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where soldiers used machetes to hack off the
limbs of women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Janowski said the U.N. would adopt new measures--including deploying
more female staff--to protect refugees. He said that the agency would
discipline any staff member found guilty of sexual exploitation or other
wrongdoing but that it was up to West African countries to pursue
criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal systems in many of these countries are weak, and it is a
chore to get law enforcement to do anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer William Orme at the United Nations contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Train Attack Kills 57 in India</HD>
<DH>Asia: Mob sets cars on fire, a fresh episode of violence in a
decade-long quarrel between Muslims and Hindus over a temple site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>An enraged Muslim mob torched a train carrying Hindu nationalists
Wednesday, killing at least 57 people and sparking fears of more violence
over a dispute rooted in the destruction of a mosque a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   At least 14 children died in the morning arson attack on the express
train after it stopped at a station in the town of Godhra, in India's
western Gujarat state. About 65 more passengers were injured, 38
critically, in the inferno that gutted four coaches and charred some
victims beyond recognition, reports from the scene said.</LD>
<LD>   India's government urged calm as it increased security in an effort to
prevent revenge attacks between the country's majority Hindus and its
Muslims. With military tensions between India and its Muslim neighbor
Pakistan still running high, and nearly a million soldiers facing each
other across the border on high alert, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee can ill afford widespread unrest within the country.</LD>
<TE>   "An inquiry is being held and we will ascertain facts [about] what
happened, and why did it happen," Vajpayee said. "But from the
preliminary reports, it appears that the train was stopped, maybe because
slogans were being shouted in the train. And clashes took place."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, a Godhra official said 51 people had been arrested on
accusations of arson, rioting and looting, Reuters news agency reported.
It said 29 others had been detained for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   There were contradictory accounts of what sparked the train attack.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu activists said that in an unprovoked attack, Muslims had
assaulted supporters of the campaign to build a Hindu temple on the site
of an ancient mosque destroyed by a rampaging Hindu mob Dec. 6, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   But quoting witnesses, the Associated Press reported from Godhra that
the four coaches were set ablaze after a crowd of Hindu nationalists
jeered and attacked Muslims as the latter got off.</TE>
<TE>   The government sent in paramilitary troops to reinforce those already
guarding the disputed holy site at Ayodhya, 345 miles southeast of New
Delhi, in the eastern part of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
Thousands of Hindu extremists are threatening to defy a court order and
start rebuilding an ancient temple there March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to protect Indian brotherhood at every cost," said Vajpayee,
whom opposition parties have accused of letting the Ayo-dhya dispute
fester far too long in the hope of gaining political advantage among
Hindu nationalists. Vajpayee is a member of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers on the train included hundreds of activists returning from
Ayodhya, where thousands have gathered to press their cause. They insist
that the mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, which Hindu extremists tore
down brick by brick, must be replaced by a temple marking what they say
is the birthplace of Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.</TE>
<TE>   They say Mughal emperor Babar destroyed the Ram temple in the 16th
century and replaced it with the mosque that the Hindu mob demolished in
1992. Many Muslims believe that is a myth rooted in Britain's former
colonial policy of "divide and rule" on the subcontinent.</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 million of India's 1 billion people are Muslims, and
while the official policy of maintaining a secular state has kept
religious tolerance strong, communal strains constantly threaten to erupt
into violence. When trouble starts, it can spread across the country like
a wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   Between 2,000 and 3,000 people died in nationwide rioting that
followed the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   At least 14,000 activists from the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad
have gathered outside the heavily guarded site of the demolished mosque,
and their leaders claim that hundreds of thousands will be there by March
15.</TE>
<TE>   The activists have already started preparing construction materials
despite Vajpayee's insistence this week that his government would prevent
any changes at the site until negotiations or a court order settles the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   A state police report on the 1992 mosque demolition named Lal Krishna
Advani, now Vajpayee's powerful home minister, and two other members of
the current Cabinet as fomenting the violence in a speech to the mob.</TE>
<TE>   A commission of inquiry is probing allegations of a conspiracy to tear
down the mosque, and when Advani testified several times last year, he
denied having anything to do with the destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Advani joined Vajpayee on Wednesday in urging Hindu nationalists to
abandon their plan to begin building the Ram temple.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution to this problem will not come by a movement of this kind
or by violence," Vajpayee said. "There are only two ways: by dialogue or
leave it to the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's violence is likely to compound Vajpayee's political
problems, just days after his party was defeated in three state
elections, including in Uttar Pradesh, which had been a stronghold of his
party.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, opposition parties brought parliament to a standstill in
protest after Vajpayee said he didn't see why supporters of the Ram
temple construction should be prevented from demonstrating peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee acknowledged, however, that his government is responsible for
making sure there isn't more violence at the holy site. But Vajpayee
didn't explain how he plans to avert another catastrophe.</TE>

<HD>PRI Leadership Vote Results in Charges of Corruption</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>A leadership election that was meant to herald the revival of
Mexico's former ruling party is instead mired in fraud allegations and
bedeviled by a nearly deadlocked result that threatens to engulf the
Institutional Revolutionary Party in bitter infighting.</LD>
<LD>   Three days after the nationwide voting, former Tabasco state Gov.
Roberto Madrazo claimed victory Wednesday by the narrowest of margins
over Beatriz Paredes for the presidency of the PRI, as the party is
known.</LD>
<LD>   But Paredes' team accused Madrazo's forces of the same old-style
vote-buying and other corrupt practices that once were hallmarks of the
PRI. That legacy of corruption was a major factor in the PRI's loss of
the presidency for the first time in 71 years to Vicente Fox in July
2000.</LD>
<TE>   A PRI weakened by internal strife could be a liability for Fox, who
needs to negotiate with a coherent opposition on major issues such as
labor reform and modernization of the nation's electricity network.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's conservative National Action Party and the center-left Party of
the Democratic Revolution are choosing new leaders in coming weeks.
Analysts have said that stronger leadership in all three parties is
critical for Fox's hopes of getting stalled reforms moving.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its loss to Fox in the presidential election, the PRI remains
a major political force in Mexico, controlling more congressional seats
than any other party and 17 of the nation's 32 governorships.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's victory, however, sent the PRI on a downward spiral for more
than a year. The party suffered embarrassing losses in governor's races
in states such as Chiapas and Yucatan. The party held a much-ballyhooed
assembly in November that called for more openness, including the first
direct election of the party's leader, as a major step toward recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But the leadership vote Sunday was too close to call after the
balloting, and fraud accusations soon spewed from both candidates' camps.</TE>
<TE>   Only on Wednesday did the party issue a preliminary final result,
giving Madrazo 1,524,081 votes to 1,470,563 for Paredes, a difference of
1.8 percentage points. The total vote was twice as high as expected,
further fueling fraud allegations.</TE>
<TE>   A victory for Madrazo would position him to seek the party's
presidential nomination in 2006. He lost the PRI primary in 1999 to
Francisco Labastida, who was then trounced by Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The charges leveled by Paredes' supporters sounded like those voiced
by opposition parties against the PRI in the past. Campaign spokesman
Jaime Aguilar Alvarez said in full-page newspaper ads Wednesday that the
worst abuses occurred in Oaxaca state, including the stuffing of ballot
boxes with Madrazo votes.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar said that in some Oaxaca ballot boxes--all with a high or even
100% turnout for Madrazo--more ballots were cast than were issued for the
polling places.</TE>
<TE>   Madrazo, the 49-year-old son of a former PRI president, campaigned as
a reformer taking on the party mandarins, whom he blamed for the party's
loss to Fox. Paredes, a 48-year-old congresswoman and former governor of
Tlaxcala state, portrayed herself as the voice of younger, more honest
party members fed up with the corruption of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Jose Antonio Crespo said the vote was like "Soviet
elections." He said the vote was particularly questionable in Tabasco,
Madrazo's home state.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Francois Prud'homme, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico who
studies political parties, said that mediation by party leaders could
resolve the dispute and save the party, "but if not, there is a great
risk of a split. . . . The risk is one of becoming a much more fragmented
system."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Saudi peace proposal, though vague, sets the stage for the
kingdom's involvement in possible talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israelis and Palestinians are locked in their deadliest battle in
decades. No political initiative has graced the horizon for months. The
fighting distracts and threatens to undermine Arab regimes throughout the
region. Nearly everyone--Arab and Jew--is exhausted.</LD>
<LD>   Into such bleak circumstances floats a proposal by Saudi Arabia that
is gaining astonishing momentum--even though it is vaguely worded,
starkly simple and not particularly creative. Headlines in newspapers
from Jerusalem to Cairo and beyond trumpet it; politicians and analysts
debate it. The European Union envoy detours to Jidda to hear more, and
President Bush bestows his praise.</LD>
<LD>   The formula, which emerged as nothing more than a trial balloon in the
New York Times, offers Israel recognition and normal economic, cultural
and political relations with the entire Arab world in exchange for the
Jewish state's withdrawal from all land it captured and occupied in the
1967 Middle East War, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   Diplomats had hoped for more details of the plan when Saudi Ambassador
Fawzi Shubukshi spoke before the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.
However, he launched into a tirade against Israel that indicated how
difficult it might be to turn the broad strategic proposal into a plan
that could be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   The much-touted proposal would seem to have little chance to prosper.
As eager as Israelis are to enjoy diplomatic normality with their Arab
neighbors, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has adamantly refused to cede more
than a portion of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Sharon reiterated that position Wednesday and said that any
future Israeli government would be similarly inclined.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the proposal has captured the imagination of many people in the
region, in part because of the rare involvement of powerful Saudi Arabia
and in part because they are so desperate for any initiative that might
staunch the flow of blood in the Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   "The public wants to grab at straws," said Galia Golan, an Israeli
political scientist and veteran peace activist.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to end 17 months of violence that has claimed more than 1,100
lives have failed repeatedly. On Wednesday, a Palestinian woman
apparently blew herself up at an Israeli military checkpoint, killing
herself and wounding three policemen. It was only the second time a woman
has carried out a suicide bombing in the uprising. She was one of five
Palestinians and one Israeli killed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy fighting raged early today as Israeli forces attacked targets in
refugee camps near the West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin. At least
seven Palestinians were killed, and Israeli troops were moving deeper
into Jenin, Palestinian officials said. Palestinian gunmen shot dead an
Israeli soldier and wounded two others, the Israeli army said.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Touting Plan</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the escalating bloodshed, the U.S. government has abdicated
its mediator role and remained largely on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   But the Saudi plan, a senior State Department official said, is
"important and interesting. And we're talking it up in the region,
including with the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   The promise of diplomatic recognition for Israel and the signal to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat that peaceful negotiations
are still possible are encouraging incentives, the official said, but
cautioned: "This is not a settlement. It has to be reached through
negotiations, after a rebuilding of trust, which has to come after an end
to the violence. So we're still where we were before; we just have a
better idea of what's down the road."</TE>
<TE>   And U.S. officials acknowledge that the idea of Israel withdrawing to
its pre-1967 borders is probably a nonstarter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, beyond sheer desperation, there are reasons for skeptical hope,
Golan and others said. Saudi Arabia, which enjoys unique moral and
political authority in the region, has stepped forward in a way it had
been reluctant to do.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, the Saudis are acting in part to improve their own image
in the U.S. after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, given that 15 of the
suspected hijackers were from the kingdom. Despite Shubukshi's harsh
speech, other Saudi officials have appeared to be sending a message to
Israel that peace is possible by ceding the captured land--a message that
could drive a further wedge between Sharon and the more dovish members of
his government.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi vision emerged as an idea relayed to New York Times
columnist Thomas Friedman by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, the desert
kingdom's de facto ruler. The Saudis began calling it an "initiative"
only after it was clear that there was no strong Arab opposition to the
plan. At the core is the historical concept of land for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah held out the prospect that Israel could become integrated
into the region, play host to 20 Arab embassies in West Jerusalem and
enjoy cultural and economic ties with all its neighbors. Only Egypt and
Jordan have diplomatic ties with Israel, but it is a "cold peace":
Neither country has had an ambassador in Israel since shortly after the
current conflict erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Previous peace efforts have failed to include guarantees that the Arab
world would formally recognize Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pay Israel in Arab currency, and this is it," said Abdel
Moneim Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, a government-funded think tank in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   "The magic word here is normalization," said Emad Shahin, a professor
of political science at American University in Cairo. "That's the
incentive for Israel."</TE>
<TE>Palestinians Have Doubts</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, who welcomed the Saudi proposal, quickly worried that
Israel was seizing the normalization part of the formula and disregarding
the part about having to withdraw from occupied territories, "focusing on
the skin and ignoring the stuffing," as Hafez Barghouti, editor of the
Palestinians' Al Hayat al Jadida newspaper, wrote in a column Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian politicians also accused Israel of trying to use the
initiative as a way to sit down with the Saudis, securing a tacit
recognition, before making any territorial or political concessions.
Sharon, after first dismissing the Saudi statement, indicated through
aides that he would be happy to talk with Saudi leaders to "clarify" it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Abdullah's motivation might be--image burnishing or regional
stability--Saudi Arabia does hold sway in the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
six-member union of oil-rich Arab states that will follow the Saudi lead.
In addition, Saudi Arabia, as home to the two most sacred sites in Islam,
has moral authority throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   A similar proposal was made last year by Libyan officials, who wield
less influence, at a closed-door meeting during an Arab League summit in
Amman, Jordan. Officials appointed a committee to study the
plan--essentially killing it.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah plans to take a more detailed version of what he is proposing
to next month's Arab League summit in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi proposal does not offer a blueprint for how Israel and the
Palestinians are to conduct negotiations. It does not mention the most
difficult, deal-breaking elements of the conflict: how to share, divide
or otherwise handle Jerusalem and how to resettle refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to mention the traditional Palestinian demands, such as
the return of refugees, prompted harsh opposition Wednesday from Islamic
groups in Jordan and the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   And there is no guarantee that all Arab states will go along. Though
the Saudis have no great love for the Israelis, countries such as
Lebanon, where about 300,000 Palestinian refugees live, and Syria are
even more hostile. Syria has claim to the Golan Heights, which Israel
also occupied in 1967 and which presumably would be part of the package.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis, in short, are offering a vast end-of-conflict vision--but
not saying how to get there.</TE>
<TE>   "The faster the initiative of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah gathers
momentum, so grow the doubts about the substantive questions that his
proposal does not answer," noted Zvi Barel, a commentator in the Israeli
newspaper Haaretz who specializes in regional Arab affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But the absence of detail may ultimately be the key to success.</TE>
<TE>   "I see very great importance in this incentive," Israeli President
Moshe Katsav said Wednesday. "The fact that there would be normalization
between the Arab world and Israel--this is certainly a dramatic step."</TE>
<TE>   As president, Katsav, a member of Sharon's right-wing Likud Party, is
only a figurehead. But he is known for his ability to read the mood of
the public, and his endorsement has put pressure on Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   But the key to the future of Abdullah's aspirations for the region
probably lies in whether the Bush administration can be reengaged.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, where is George W. Bush on this?" said Israeli
strategic analyst Joseph Alpher. "This proposal can create a lot of stir
and noise, but it can't work unless the Americans get behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson reported from Jerusalem and Slackman from Cairo. Times staff
writer Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Ambassador Berates Israel Before U.N. Council</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The tirade on Palestinian suffering surprises and
disappoints envoys hoping for details on crown prince's recent peace
initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Angering Israelis and disappointing other diplomats here, a senior
Saudi official lashed out at Israel on Wednesday in a speech to the
Security Council that was widely but wrongly expected to be the first
public articulation of a new peace initiative promoted by Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   In the much-anticipated address, the Saudi ambassador to the United
Nations barely mentioned the initiative, other than to refer to the
enthusiastic reception it has received from governments and commentators
around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he launched into a bitter attack on Israel that appeared to
undermine the advertised premise of the much-touted Saudi plan.</LD>
<TE>   "No one can deny that what the Palestinian people are undergoing in
the occupied territories is one of the worst forms of injustice inflicted
by man, one of the worst examples of pressure and persecution and racism
and systematic oppression in the history of mankind," said Ambassador
Fawzi Shubukshi.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective of Israel was and remains the expulsion of the Arab
people from Palestine," he angrily declared.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, which is not represented on the 15-member Security
Council, had asked Tuesday for permission to address the group during an
open debate on the Middle East. Diplomats who had praised the peace
gestures coming from Riyadh had speculated that the Saudis would use the
opportunity to clarify their seemingly shifting policy.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's de facto ruler, is said to
be ready to pledge the swift establishment of full diplomatic ties
between Arab nations and Israel once Israel withdraws from lands it has
occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to send a signal to the Israeli public that peace is
possible," Adel al Jubeir, a senior aide to Abdullah, said in Washington
earlier Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But if Israeli officials or frustrated Western peace mediators were
expecting further peace signals from the Saudis here, they got something
quite different: a forceful and openly angry reiteration of the
traditional Arab case against Israel, and an unapologetic defense of
Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   "No one denies that every state has the right to ensure the security
of its people," Shubukshi said. "But is this right the exclusive right of
Israel? Can they deprive Arabs of their rights and expand their
settlement for security reasons and dominate others for security reasons
and impose blockades for security reasons? Where is security for the
Palestinians?</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinian violence is only a result of Israeli terrorism," he
continued. "It is an expression of bitterness and frustration after many
years of waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli diplomats, some of whom had previously welcomed the apparent
Saudi peace proposal, expressed dismay at Shubukshi's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here expecting him to elaborate about what was reported to be
a peace initiative from the crown prince," said Aaron Jacob, Israel's
deputy representative here. "And rather than that, he leveled a series of
allegations against the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shubukshi echoed his government's earlier calls for peaceful
negotiations in the conflict with the help of foreign mediators. "Both
parties need external assistance to stop the cycle of violence," he said.
"Bitterness and mutual distrust become worse every day."</TE>
<TE>   Before the ambassador's address, which came near the end of the
two-day council debate, the nascent Saudi initiative had been repeatedly
praised by other diplomats here. Countries saluting Abdullah's
"interesting ideas" and "constructive proposals" included the United
States, Japan, Canada, many European states and such leading developing
nations as South Africa, Singapore and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the move was also strongly backed by Egypt and Jordan,
the only two Arab nations that have diplomatic relations with Israel.
Tunisia and Morocco also welcomed it, though more cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   And Palestinian representatives here embraced it as an endorsement by
the Arab world's most influential states of their own long-standing
position that Israel should expect full diplomatic recognition from all
its neighbors if it withdraws from lands occupied after the 1967 war. In
order to keep the spotlight on the Saudi plan, the Palestinians decided
Tuesday to table a draft Security Council resolution that they had
planned to submit to a vote this week despite the near certainty of a
U.S. veto.</TE>
<TE>   But Syria, which would regain control of the Golan Heights if Israel
accepted the Saudi formula, expressed open skepticism. The Middle East
doesn't need new initiatives but Israeli compliance with past Security
Council resolutions, asserted Syrian Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe, the sole
Arab representative on the council. Israel "is trying to mark time and to
avoid pulling out of all occupied territories, including East Jerusalem
and the Syrian Golan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Middle East experts who have spoken privately to Abdullah's aides in
the past week said the crown prince accepted the concept of territorial
trade-offs that would let Israel annex some large Jewish settlements
outside Israel's pre-1967 borders in exchange for land for Palestinians
elsewhere along the border. The prince was also said to support proposals
already accepted by Palestinian negotiators for continued Israeli rule in
Jewish neighborhoods and holy sites in and around Jerusalem's Old City.</TE>
<TE>   But in his speech here Wednesday, Shubukshi called for Israel's "total
withdrawal from the occupied territories," including all of East
Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah met Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Javier Solana, the
European Union's chief diplomat. Abdullah said he would pursue his
proposal at an Arab League meeting in Lebanon next month, according to
Solana's aides.</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador from Yemen, the current leader of the U.N. Arab bloc,
said Wednesday that the Arab nations were unlikely to submit any further
Security Council resolutions until after the Arab League conclave in
Beirut, where they would try to reach a consensus position on the Saudi
proposal.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Britain's scientists got the green light Wednesday to pioneer the
cloning of human embryos for research and set up the world's first embryo
cell bank.</LD>
<LD>   An influential House of Lords committee ruled that embryo cloning
should be allowed to proceed under strict conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Committee Chairman Richard Harries said embryo cells could be crucial
to finding a cure for diseases such as Alzheimer's.</LD>
<TE>   "We conclude that for this to be fully realized, no avenue of research
should be blocked off at this stage," Harries told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Britain became the first country to explicitly allow the
creation of embryos as a source of stem cells--primitive master cells
that turn into other cell types.</TE>
<TE>   But Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had to rush through revised
legislation to close a legal loophole allowing cloning for reproductive
purposes. Research was in effect put on hold until Wednesday's
announcement.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Touts Fun and Games to Lure Japanese Tourists</HD>
<DH>Asia: Official at Tokyo gathering breaks into song to promote
upcoming festival. But a vacation in the isolated nation may be tough
sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Japan got a taste of North Korean marketing Wednesday when the
isolated Communist state kicked off a publicity campaign designed to lure
tourists to its two-month "Arirang" festival.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare opening to outsiders by the Stalinist state, North Korea
hopes that thousands of foreign visitors will come to watch mass sports
and arts spectacles that start in late April in honor of the state's late
founder and his son, its current leader.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently hoping to make the karaoke-loving Japanese feel right at
home, the head of the North Korean tourist delegation burst into song in
the middle of a packed news conference here--and didn't stop for more
than 10 minutes as he ran through several regional versions of the
Arirang theme song.</LD>
<TE>   The performance prompted a quick look of amused surprise from one of
his North Korean colleagues, a show of emotion soon replaced by the stony
pose maintained throughout the rest of the two-hour gathering.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans also treated the 70 or so assembled reporters and
travel agents to a propaganda video showing children running toward
flowers in slow motion, North Korea's relatively empty roads and
skyscrapers, and Caucasian visitors eating noodles and dancing as other
visitors play golf.</TE>
<TE>   "The video was only five minutes," said Jun Miyagawa, a part-time
Japan representative for the festival, whose day job is selling socialist
books. "If you want, we can see it again."</TE>
<TE>   His opening was met with deafening silence, prompting him to return to
description of the wonders of the wondrous mass spectacles.</TE>
<TE>   Miyagawa's enthusiasm contrasted sharply with the North Korean
officials--songs and smirks aside--who appeared halfhearted at best over
the prospect of so many visitors descending on their country.</TE>
<TE>Officials Refuse to Answer Questions</TE>
<TE>   In response to a series of questions about whether Japanese
journalists would be allowed in, how many visitors they expect, whether
Japanese of Korean descent would receive visas and whether North Korea
was now making nice after recent charges of sending a spy ship into
Japan's neighboring waters, the officials sidestepped, deflected or
otherwise issued the North Korean equivalent of "no comment."</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you keep asking me the same question, you're not going to get
any further information," said Hwang Pong Hyok, director of promotion for
North Korea's National Tourist Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The festival, designed to glorify North Korea's leadership, is named
after the popular and catchy Korean "Arirang" song written in the late
19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Whether this Communist marketing can pull in good capitalist moola
remains to be seen. Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations or
direct airline connections, so Japanese visitors would have to go through
Beijing, Vladivostok or even Moscow, many a time zone away. Japanese
tourists also tend to have a relatively low tolerance for risk, and
they're only just returning to perceived safe overseas destinations such
as Australia or China after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will be an easy sell given North Korea's notoriety
as an 'axis of evil' country," said Hiroshi Ueno, an official with the
Japan Travel Bureau, referring to President Bush's recent comments. "Most
people probably won't see this as a particularly relaxing vacation
destination."</TE>
<TE>   North Korean officials said they're hoping for 5,000 Japanese but
would be happy with 1,000. The price of accommodations in Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, is cheap "by international standards," they added.
The all-inclusive packages are expected to cost about $500 per day.</TE>
<TE>   If North Korea really wants to build a following among Japanese
tourists, it will need patience and a basic understanding of free-market
principles, said Toshiko Kato, a spokeswoman with the Japan Assn. of Tour
Agencies. Vietnam, Cambodia and China worked for years to build up their
tourist industries through hard work and improved
infrastructure--including better toilets, Kato said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because they arrive today," she said, "they can't expect flowers
to bloom tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese tour agencies also risk getting caught in the industry
equivalent of the demilitarized zone, said Ryoichi Morotome, a spokesman
with Kinki Japan Tourist agency. "Even if the trips sell well, South
Korean agencies could threaten to cut us out of their market unless we
stop selling North Korean tours," he said.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea experts say the North's motivation in opening its
festivals to foreign visitors is pride and profits. Pyongyang is wary of
South Korea getting all the attention when it co-hosts soccer's World Cup
this year with Japan, they say. And the cash-starved nation badly needs
hard currency.</TE>
<TE>   "But mass games aren't a productive activity," said Tsutomu Nishioka,
an analyst with Japan's Modern Korea Research Institute. "The 100,000
North Koreans should really be out in the paddies planting rice."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons North Korea apparently prefers Japanese tourists is
because they're seen as relatively well-behaved and less likely to
embarrass the tightfisted regime.</TE>
<TE>   Americans aren't generally welcome, nor are South Koreans, given the
usually frosty relations between Pyongyang and their capitals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're targeting us because we have a reputation for all
doing the same thing at the same time once a trend gets started," said
Junko Yoshida, an official with the HIS Travel agency.</TE>
<TE>   But Japanese tourists on a similar trip several years ago bridled
under all the restrictions and the lack of contact with the locals, tour
official Kato said. "People from a free country are used to doing things
they want to do," she said. "If they have a lot of restrictions again, it
could be a problem."</TE>
<TE>Tourist Recalls Surprises From Past Visits</TE>
<TE>   One Japanese tourist, who visited North Korea in 1991 and 2001 and
asked not to be identified given his desire to return, said many visitors
may be pleasantly surprised by their reception. He says he found many of
the guides on his most recent trip quite sophisticated, to the point
where he believes they were even schooled in telling Japanese jokes.</TE>
<TE>   They also learn fast, he says. His North Korean guides took
videotapes, quickly edited them and sold them to the tourists for $40 per
tape. They also used them for their own propaganda purposes. Shots of
Japanese applauding mass spectacles were spliced with images of North
Korean head Kim Jong Il beneath headlines about how impressed foreign
visitors were with the country's leadership. "A lot of Japanese will be
tricked into this sort of thing, I'm 120% sure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A brochure provided by the North Koreans lists three tour options. The
highlight for each is the Arirang festival. "It's very mysterious," Hwang
promised, "and beyond your wildest dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Rie Sasaki in The Times' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Russian Not an Arms Dealer, Caller Says</HD>
<DH>Probe: Victor Bout, accused of transporting weapons for Al Qaeda,
runs an ordinary cargo firm, according to a man claiming to be his
sibling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>A man who identified himself as the brother of a Russian
businessman accused of transporting arms for Al Qaeda terrorists said
Wednesday that his sibling was a common air carrier, not an arms dealer,
who had no idea what his cargo was.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei Bout, 41, angrily dismissed allegations against his 35-year-old
brother, Victor. In a phone interview with The Times, he did not divulge
his brother's whereabouts, but said he is "now living quite legally,
residing in one country."</LD>
<LD>   "No one is investigating him, and no one is sending any queries to any
agencies about him," Sergei Bout said. He described as nonsense
allegations that his brother was involved in shipping weapons from the
United Arab Emirates to the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   Bout phoned the Los Angeles Times' Moscow Bureau, and it was not
possible to verify his identity. However, the call came after several
efforts to contact him through intermediaries.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian authorities last week issued an arrest warrant for Victor Bout
on suspicion of money laundering. He also has been cited in U.N. reports
for alleged arms trafficking in Africa, and Belgian authorities are
examining claims he is involved in diamond smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the United Nations and the State Department said,
Victor Bout has moved his network of 60 cargo planes and 300 pilots and
employees from Belgium to South Africa and to his most recent base in the
United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   But Sergei Bout compared his brother to a taxi driver who had no idea
of his clients' cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a taxi driver who is supposed to give a lift to a customer .
. . but suddenly this taxi driver asks the customer, 'What have you got
in your suitcase?' " Sergei Bout said in the interview.</TE>
<TE>   He said that in such an instance, the contents of the cargo is none of
the carrier's business: "I am a taxi driver; I am a carrier. I don't know
what I carry. Maybe I carry a nuclear bomb. No one is telling me about
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Victor] is just an ordinary carrier. There are thousands of them
in the world," Sergei Bout said.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Bout said reports by The Times and other media about his
brother were "total nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   A four-year Belgian police investigation into Victor Bout's finances
peaked this year just as the U.S. and other Western governments were
looking into new allegations that his air cargo network aided Al Qaeda
terrorists and Taliban militants in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian and other officials involved in the search for Bout have yet
to determine where he is.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing a claim frequently made in Russia, Sergei Bout said Wednesday
that he believed the allegations against his brother were part of a
Western plot. He charged that the aim of it was to undermine successful
Russian transport firms competing against Western companies.</TE>
<TE>   He also attacked the credibility of U.N. reports on his brother, which
he said could mean millions of dollars in lost business.</TE>
<TE>   An October 2001 U.N. Security Council report on fighting in Angola
said Sergei Bout held an interest in a firm that acted as a subcontractor
for his brother.</TE>
<TE>   A member of a U.N. panel directed by the Security Council to
investigate Victor Bout's operation in the Emirate of Sharjah and its
role in transporting arms to Liberia has identified Sergei Bout as the
operator of Air Cess, a transportation company originally owned by his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Johan Peleman, a Belgian arms-trafficking expert who served on the
Liberia panel, said Sergei Bout told U.N. investigators in the UAE that
"he was no longer in business with his brother, although there may be
occasional contractual agreements between his companies and those of
Victor."</TE>
<TE>   Peleman said Sergei Bout also told the U.N. team, "Victor is not
really involved with aviation anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Bout told The Times on Wednesday that he had been in a
different line of business from his brother but that he was taking a
break from it. He did not say what that business was.</TE>

Sergei L. Loiko of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. government renewed a request for DNA material from
relatives of Osama bin Laden after a CIA missile struck a group of
unidentified men in Afghanistan this month, a U.S. official said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In disclosing the request, the government acknowledged for the first
time that it does not have a sample of DNA from a Bin Laden relative.
Such a sample would be crucial to the United States' ability to determine
whether the Al Qaeda leader was killed by that CIA strike or any other
bombing raid in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   News of the request renewed speculation that Bin Laden may have been
among three people killed by a Hellfire missile fired Feb. 4 from an
unmanned Predator spy plane operated by the CIA.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the missile hit a "tall figure" around whom other men
appeared to be gathering in the rugged Zhawar Kili area of eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said the group had been under surveillance and was moving
in an area known to be an Al Qaeda hide-out, but officials later
expressed doubt that Bin Laden had been hit. Subsequent news reports from
the region even suggested that those hit might have been scrap collectors
rather than Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   It took days for U.S. soldiers to reach the scene, and Pentagon
officials have said there were no identifiable remains there. But human
tissue samples were taken from the area, and a U.S. official said
Wednesday that the samples would be compared to any DNA material supplied
by Bin Laden's relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that
there is no new intelligence to suggest that Bin Laden was killed in the
strike. "Some people are trying to reach that conclusion," he said. "But
that's not one I would draw."</TE>
<TE>   He said there is no new information to contradict recent statements by
Pentagon officials and members of Congress that Bin Laden is believed to
have survived the U.S. aerial campaign and to still be hiding along the
Afghanistan-Pakistan border.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been interest in getting [DNA material] for quite some time,"
the official said. The scant remains left behind in Zhawar Kili, he said,
merely "renewed interest in getting this kind of material."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to specify how the DNA request had been conveyed to the
Bin Laden family, other than to say that it had been made through
intermediaries, not directly by U.S. government officials.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would he explain why the government has been unable to obtain the
samples. Bin Laden has at least 20 children and dozens of siblings--some
of whom have lived in the United States and have publicly repudiated the
Al Qaeda leader.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bin Laden's relatives reside in Saudi Arabia, where his late
father built a construction empire. Bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was
revoked in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said DNA can be culled from almost any human tissue, including
skin or hair. But in paternity disputes and criminal cases, courts
generally rely on blood samples or cheek cells swabbed from the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Wednesday, President Bush nominated John L. Helgerson to be
inspector general of the CIA, the agency's top internal watchdog post.
Helgerson, currently chairman of the National Intelligence Council, must
be confirmed by the Senate.</TE>

<HD>Bag Scanning System Called Easily Foiled</HD>
<DH>Security: Federal agent says machines being deployed at U.S.
airports were easily defeated by undercover teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The $1-million machines the government plans to deploy by the
hundreds to scan airline baggage for bombs have been foiled repeatedly by
undercover teams simulating terrorists, a veteran federal agent charged
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We were extraordinarily successful in mock-destroying aircraft and
killing large numbers of innocent people in . . . simulated attacks,"
said Bogdan Dzakovic, supervisor of a special Federal Aviation
Administration team that tested airport security. "This occurred with
such regularity and ease as to present a frightening picture of the sorry
state of aviation security on a worldwide basis. This was all before
9/11."</LD>
<LD>   These and other public allegations by Dzakovic raise questions about
the government's effort to ensure that all checked bags are screened
effectively for hidden bombs by the end of the year. The charges also
provide a glimpse of the highly secretive manner in which plainclothes
agents test the nation's aviation security system.</LD>
<TE>   The Office of Special Counsel, an agency charged with protecting
federal whistle-blowers, asked Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta
earlier this month to investigate allegations by Dzakovic that FAA
managers suppressed information about gaps in airport security.</TE>
<TE>   A former air marshal and 14-year veteran of FAA security, Dzakovic
supervised an FAA "red team" that was charged with aggressively trying to
expose gaps in security. Beginning in 1999 and continuing until a few
weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks, Dzakovic said, red team undercover
tests found poor detection rates by machines that were supposed to find
bombs. However, it was not clear whether the problem was with the
machines, their human operators, or the interaction of technology and
operator.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 200 of the machines are now being used at airports around
the country, including Los Angeles International. An estimated 2,990
would be needed to cover all 429 airports with regular airline service,
at a cost of more than $2.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Senior spokesman Chet Lunner said Mineta has asked Transportation
Inspector General Kenneth Mead to investigate Dzakovic's charges, some of
which concern incidents in the mid- to late 1990s. "The secretary has
asked the inspector general to vigorously pursue these allegations,"
Lunner said.</TE>
<TE>   A new Transportation Security Administration, headed by a former
Secret Service director, has taken over security from the FAA and the
airlines. "Our current system is not the subject of these allegations,"
Lunner said. "We are confident that the system we have now in place is an
improvement. . . . Security is much tighter."</TE>
<TE>   But Dzakovic, who is now a Transportation Security Administration
employee, said the new agency is working with the same equipment and many
of the same people as the old FAA security division. "It's a big mistake,
how they're doing it," he said, of the explosive detection effort. He
spoke at a news conference in support of new legislation to strengthen
whistle-blower protections.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a senior member of the House Commerce
Committee, said the allegations are worrisome. "I have written letters to
the FAA and the Department of Transportation to encourage the testing and
approval of a variety of new technologies to protect our airports,"
Markey said. "It is not enough to rely on one type of technology to
protect the public against the multiplicity of threats that the post 9/11
world has shown us is likely."</TE>
<TE>   The baggage scanners--which are the size of a large automobile and can
be seen in major airport lobbies--are considered a state-of-the-art means
of detecting explosives. They rely on CT technology similar to that used
for medical diagnosis, and are widely considered to be superior to
traditional X-ray machines.</TE>
<TE>   The actual detection rate of the CT-based machines is classified. The
Transportation Department inspector general has said that they are
effective in finding explosives, but that operators can be prone to error
as they make split-second judgments on bags identified as suspicious by
the scanner.</TE>
<TE>   However, in congressional testimony last October, a Defense Department
official charged with overseeing FAA tests of the equipment said the
technology itself leaves something to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   "I can state unequivocally . . . that the current levels that have
been established for positive explosives detection [and] permissible
false alarm rates . . . are not those rates desired by the aviation
industry," said James O'Bryon, then deputy director of live-fire testing
for the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather, these thresholds have been driven by the inability of the
current equipment to perform any better," O'Bryon added. "If the
thresholds were tightened by only a couple of percentage points, there
would currently be few, if any [explosive detection] equipment certified
at all."</TE>
<TE>   Dzakovic said results were "so poor" when his team first conducted its
undercover tests that his supervisor tried to cover up the problem.
Dzakovic was ordered to alert FAA officials at local airports in advance
of any further testing.</TE>
<TE>   "My next two trips to test security under these conditions resulted in
100% detection," Dzakovic said. "I stopped making notifications after
this and our testing results returned to their normal low levels. Our
government is now poised to spend $2 billion on these machines."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Department officials have said they are looking at a
variety of methods to meet a year-end congressional deadline for
screening about 1 billion checked bags with explosive detection
equipment.</TE>

<LD>The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are
investigating whether a power outage on the final day of the Winter
Olympics that hit Salt Lake International Airport may have been caused by
a bomb, said the director of Utah Olympic public safety.</LD>
<LD>   A chain-link fence had been cut at the power substation--which had
been under 24-hour guard during the Games--and there was evidence of an
explosion involving a circuit breaker, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The power loss, which affected 33,000 customers, lasted for about an
hour. Electricity was cut to the airport and the downtown media center.
No flights were affected at the airport, which ran on generators until

<HD>Political Friction, Victims' Families May Block Plans for Trade
Center Site</HD>
<DH>Ground zero: Signs of normalcy emerge, but wrangling of business
leaders could delay the redevelopment and a memorial for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>After months of bitter wrangling, parents will finally send their
children back to classes this morning at the last public school to reopen
near the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   Just before noon, a popular clothing store damaged in the attacks will
reopen near ground zero, welcoming back thousands of loyal customers.</LD>
<LD>   And by late afternoon, families of victims in the attacks will meet
for the first time with the panel planning the redevelopment of the area
and the construction of a temporary memorial for those who perished.</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, life is moving forward in a community that was
devastated on Sept. 11. But behind the scenes there is acrimony among
business leaders over what should be built at the site, growing political
friction at City Hall and grass-roots discontent that could block any new
construction here for years.</TE>
<TE>   These might be serious problems in other cities, but in the Big Apple
they are unmistakable signs of the healing process. United in numbing
grief for nearly six months, New Yorkers are throwing sharp elbows once
again, trading blows over the recovery and rebuilding of their city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough town to get anything built in, a hard place to reach
any kind of consensus," said Marilyn Taylor, who chairs Skidmore, Owings
&amp; Merrill, a prominent architectural firm involved in the planning
debate. "But we have to do that in lower Manhattan, because in terms of
new development possibilities, we may have the opportunity of a
lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Above it all looms Larry Silverstein, the developer who holds a
99-year lease to the World Trade Center site and is eager to rebuild his
$3.2-billion prize as quickly as possible. Gov. George Pataki encouraged
him to move quickly on an initial phase of construction, then urged
caution. The development panel gave him mixed signals. On Tuesday, New
York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told Silverstein to slow down while a
blueprint for the whole area is worked out, setting up a protracted
wrangle over the 16-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   "I would recommend stalling a little while longer," the mayor said,
all but derailing Silverstein's plan to quickly rebuild World Trade
Center Building 7, a 47-story structure he owned near the site that
collapsed after the twin towers fell. "I think over the summer you'll see
people sitting down and looking at a more comprehensive plan," Bloomberg
added.</TE>
<TE>   Few observers are surprised because this is a city where big
construction plans face inordinate hurdles. New York spent 20 years
wrestling with an ambitious plan to build a superhighway down Manhattan's
west side, for example, but the project grew to boondoggle proportions
and then collapsed amid a flurry of lawsuits, neighborhood protests and
political delays.</TE>
<TE>   In most other communities, Silverstein would be in the driver's seat.
He's got prized land to develop, money to burn from a $3.4-billion
insurance settlement and a gung-ho spirit. Although he has yet to reveal
his blueprints, the 70-year-old businessman is expected to promote a plan
with several towers of varying height, a large mall and a victims'
memorial.</TE>
<TE>   But he's just one more voice in New York City, where some victim
groups are threatening to stage acts of civil disobedience at ground zero
if bulldozers break ground to erect any commercial or office structures.</TE>
<TE>   The developer was unavailable for comment, but his spokesman, Howard
Rubenstein, said with a sigh: "Mr. Silverstein is willing to be patient,
until everyone else involved in this process is ready to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the debate so far, that could take months, if not years.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear that new construction might aggravate existing air pollution
problems in the area, given the varying levels of asbestos and lead that
have been monitored indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Sprague, who was until recently the head of the PTA at PS 89,
said most parents are glad that students will return to classrooms today.
But Sprague and others are not convinced that the air is safe. With
reluctance, she decided to send her children to another school.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hard decision, made for a lot of complex reasons," she said.
"While we don't believe the air inside the school is dangerous to the
children, we certainly didn't get all of the reassurances we needed."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to return children to the school was rushed, she said,
"and I really don't see the need for all of this rushing in lower
Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   For local business leaders, however, the city can't move quickly
enough to restore economic growth. There were an estimated 100,000 jobs
lost in the community after the attacks, and more than 20% of the
estimated 25,000 residents left their homes, said Julie Menin, founder of
Wall Street Rising, a new nonprofit group trying to spur economic
activity and tourism in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing some signs of life here," she noted, "but it's very
slow."</TE>
<TE>   While tourist activity has picked up in the area, many restaurants are
still suffering a significant fall-off in business. Business leaders hope
that the recent opening of a glitzy Ritz Carlton Hotel near Battery Park
City will lure more visitors, along with plans to host a TriBeCa Film
Festival and an art gallery festival in and around the Wall Street area.</TE>
<TE>   They are also looking forward to today's reopening of the Century 21
discount clothing store, which was one of the more popular shopping sites
in the trade center area.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, state officials unveiled plans to develop more than $200
million in rent subsidies to keep residents in lower Manhattan. Depending
on how close they live to the trade center site, some families might be
eligible to receive as much as $12,000 in onetime housing grants.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the short-term things we need to do," said Menin, whose
group is sponsoring a new discount card that will offer visitors lower
prices at restaurants, galleries, theaters and other local businesses.</TE>
<TE>   But in the long run, she added, nothing will jump-start the economy
like new construction at the World Trade Center site. Every day, new
ideas for development of the site pour into the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp.'s offices. This week, for example, Rebuild Downtown Our
Town, a coalition of citizens, business and professional groups and
property owners, released a white paper calling for moderate growth.</TE>
<TE>   Dismissing Silverstein's plans for quick construction, the detailed
report said the recovery of bodies remains the top priority at ground
zero: "Plans must recognize that the World Trade Center site is a
hallowed, sacred burial ground, which must be a peaceful, serene place to
mourn. It is not simply a development site. Construction should be
minimized."</TE>
<TE>   Yet those who call for a memorial on much of the site are still
thrashing out the details. Should it be a huge, soaring structure, along
with a museum, as former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has
suggested? Or should the memorial be more modest in scale, as many
architects recommend?</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, flanked by victims' families, announced Wednesday that two
beams of light will rise from near the World Trade Center site as a
temporary memorial to victims of Sept. 11. The "Tribute of Light" will
run from March 11 to April 13, said Marian Fontana, president of the
Sept. 11 Widows' and Victims' Families Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But plans to erect another temporary memorial have sparked
controversy. Last week, a coalition of victim groups approved the idea of
locating a shrine in Battery Park, a few blocks from ground zero. The
proposed glass sphere would memorialize all who died on Sept. 11, as well
as the six people who perished in the 1993 attack on the World Trade
Center site.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can move forward on the plan for a temporary memorial,"
said a source close to the negotiations. "But this is New York. It's hard
to get things done here. The whole plan could change in a heartbeat."</TE>

<HD>Hotel Guard Admits to Lying About Pilot Radio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A hotel security guard pleaded guilty Wednesday to lying when he
told FBI agents he found an aviation radio in the locked safe of a room
occupied by an Egyptian graduate student that was near the World Trade
Center on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The guard, Ronald Ferry, 48, did not explain why he lied to
authorities. But his statements were a key factor leading to the
student's monthlong confinement as investigators tried to determine who
owned the radio, which was capable of communicating with the terrorists
on the planes that crashed into the twin towers.</LD>
<LD>   In January, prosecutors dropped charges against Abdallah Higazy, 30, a
computer science student at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn after a
pilot came forward to say the radio belonged to him.</LD>
<TE>   The pilot, who prosecutors said had no connection with Higazy, also
had stayed in the Millennium Hilton hotel at the time of the terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   During his appearance in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on
Wednesday, Ferry admitted the radio wasn't found in the safe, as he had
claimed.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was found on a desk in that room by a co-worker of mine,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The radio was discovered when hotel employees the conducted an
inventory of property that guests left behind when they evacuated the
hotel after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot, who was not identified, occupied a room a floor below
Higazy's room, which was on the 51st floor. It was unclear how the radio
ended up in Higazy's room.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of conduct can have serious repercussions for innocent
individuals implicated by false information," U.S. Atty. James B. Comey
said of Ferry's false statements to FBI agents. "It also unnecessarily
drains important law enforcement resources that are dedicated to
investigating the Sept. 11 attacks and disrupting future acts of
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   When Higazy returned to the hotel Dec. 17 to retrieve his belongings,
FBI agents showed him the radio, which he denied was his.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy, who was placed at the hotel by the Institute of International
Education while he was looking for permanent housing, said aside from the
hotel's housekeeping staff, he never had visitors to his room.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy was detained as a material witness Dec. 17 and later charged
with lying to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge George Daniels told Ferry he could face five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine for making the false statements when he is
sentenced May 30.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of court, Anthony Ricco, one of Ferry's lawyers, said the plea
agreement did not stipulate that his client would cooperate with
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office said investigation is continuing and other
employees of the hotel are being questioned.</TE>

<HD>20 Charged in Boston Airport Security Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Aviation: A thorough screening of records finds mostly minor
infractions by immigrant workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Nearly six months after two planes that took off from Logan
International Airport here crashed into the World Trade Center, officials
announced that 20 airport employees were charged Wednesday with a series
of mostly minor immigration violations.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. Michael J. Sullivan said Wednesday that the review of
employment records of 3,500 airport workers with access to secure areas
began soon after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "It is an arduous task," Sullivan said at an airport news conference.
He said the records of about one-third of the employees at Logan with
access to secure areas were "significantly, painstakingly screened. It is
labor-intensive."</LD>
<TE>   A similar crackdown took place at Salt Lake City International Airport
in December, in anticipation of the Winter Olympic Games, when 271
employees were fired.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, 27 workers at Las Vegas' McCarran International
Airport were indicted in a similar effort.</TE>
<TE>   Logan Airport has been heavily criticized for lax security since
terrorists took over the two planes bound for the West Coast on Sept. 11.
A number of consultants--including a security expert from Israel's Ben
Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv--have examined the facility since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The employees charged here Wednesday all worked for businesses based
at Logan. None of those charged worked for airlines or for Massport, the
agency that oversees New England's largest airport.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said fraudulent information on job applications--ranging
from fake birth dates to phony Social Security numbers--enabled the
employees to obtain badges that allowed them access to tarmacs, baggage
handling areas, runways and--as cleaning or food service
workers--airplanes themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan stressed Wednesday that "there is no indication that any of
these 20 individuals were in any way connected with terrorist
activities."</TE>
<TE>   Among the employers of those charged Wednesday was Argenbright
Holdings, the security company that operated out of Logan until Sept. 11.
Argenbright lost its contract at Logan and was replaced by another
company.</TE>
<TE>   A Massport spokesman said the record review leading to Wednesday's
arrests was only possible because federal officials stepped in. Jose
Juves said Massport, which issues security badges to airport employees,
does not have the authority to verify Social Security numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the maximum check permissible under the law with information
made available to Massport," Juves said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those charged here Wednesday were illegal immigrants accused
of using forged, counterfeited or altered registration cards or other
forms of improper documentation.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the charge, the maximum punishment is 10 years in prison
and $250,000 in fines, Sullivan said. He noted that some of those taken
into custody may face multiple charges.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan added that the only common element his office could find to
link the individuals charged was "that they were 20 individuals looking
for gainful employment."</TE>

<HD>Genetic Test Reveals Risk of Bad Reaction to AIDS Drug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>Researchers have for the first time found a way to identify people
who are likely to suffer severe allergic reactions to the widely used
AIDS drug abacavir.</LD>
<LD>   About 5% of patients who receive the drug suffer vomiting, fever, rash
and shortness of breath after taking it. In those cases, continued use of
the drug, which has the trade name Ziagen, can be fatal.</LD>
<LD>   Australian researchers reported here at the ninth annual Retrovirus
Conference and in this week's edition of the journal Lancet that the
reaction occurs in people who carry a specific gene variant. By screening
for the gene before beginning therapy, physicians can detect patients at
risk and switch them to alternative drugs, said Dr. Simon Mallal of the
Royal Perth Hospital. That would eliminate most of the adverse reactions,
he said.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers from GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures the drug,
reported similar results here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a truly astonishing connection between a human genetic marker
and the risk of a potentially fatal drug reaction," Dr. Charles Flexner
of Johns Hopkins University told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In an accompanying editorial in Lancet, Dr. Amalio Telenti and his
colleagues at University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, predicted
that it would soon be possible to screen patients for a large number of
such genetic risk factors.</TE>
<TE>   "This projection may look farfetched, with just a few relevant genes
identified, but these are the first drops before a downpour," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But they cautioned that cost could be a major impediment. The
screening costs about $500 per patient, they said. With 1 in 20 patients,
on average, being at risk, the cost per case of hypersensitivity detected
comes to $10,000 to $50,000, they said.</TE>
<TE>   As more such genetic links are identified, the cost of screening will
be reduced, making it a more cost-effective procedure, Telenti said.</TE>
<TE>   The initial adverse reaction of patients to abacavir can be readily
controlled by simply halting the drug's use. But if the drug is started
up again, the reaction becomes more severe and can even be lethal.</TE>
<TE>   The incidence of the reaction varies among ethnic groups. Mallal said
hypersensitivity occurs in about 9% of his patients, which is why he
started trying to find a way to screen for it.</TE>
<TE>   Mallal and his colleagues studied 167 HIV-positive patients who were
known to be tolerant to abacavir and 18 who displayed hypersensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   They found three genetic variants that were linked to the
hypersensitivity. The most important was a gene called HLA-B5701.
Patients with that gene variant were 100 times more likely to suffer an
adverse reaction to the drug than those with other variants.</TE>

<LD>The British government Wednesday asked Gov. Roy Barnes to spare the
life of a dual British American citizen scheduled to die next month for
the 1985 rape and murder of a Georgia woman.</LD>
<LD>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called Barnes to ask him to
commute Tracy Lee Housel's sentence to life in prison. Housel, 43, was
born in Bermuda, a British territory, but has lived most of his life in
the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Barnes' spokeswoman Joselyn Baker said the governor told Straw he does
not have the authority to change the sentence and referred Straw to the
parole board.</LD>

<HD>Jeffords Treated as a Hero at Democrats' Senate Fund-Raiser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>At the Democrats' $10,000-a-plate Senate fund-raiser, it was
Independent James M. Jeffords who stole the spotlight and most of the
applause, promising to help party leaders keep the majority he handed
them last spring.</LD>
<LD>   The Vermont senator made the equivalent of a victory lap Wednesday
night, reaping again Democratic laurels over his decision to leave the
Republican Party and single-handedly change the course of the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Gone was the reluctant party-switcher.</LD>
<TE>   "One day, as I listened to Sen. [Phil] Gramm go on and on about how
the most important legislative work we needed to do was cut the tax rate
on the higher tax brackets, it struck me again, 'What am I doing here?
What are these people thinking?' " Jeffords said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords also left no doubt that he would use his newfound celebrity
on the campaign trail to help other Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "One man or one woman can make a difference," Jeffords said. "We will
work hard to ensure that Sen. [Tom] Daschle continues to be our majority
leader."</TE>
<TE>   The dinner, held among the marble pillars and candlelight of a
secluded area of the city's Union Station, was the primary fund-raiser
for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. It drew about 500
people, including 47 senators.</TE>
<TE>   The event was expected to raise at least $6 million. Many who bought
tickets often do not plan to attend.</TE>
<TE>   To say Jeffords was treated as a hero would not be an overstatement.</TE>
<TE>   After a gourmet meal, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called Jeffords'
decision the most courageous "this town has seen in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The standing ovation: 36 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   When people finally took their seats, Murray continued, "Jim Jeffords
is the best friend we have in the U.S. Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Another standing ovation: 22 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords didn't disappoint, criticizing President Bush and Republican
policy on education, abortion, missile defense and energy.</TE>
<TE>   "It became increasingly clear that my optimism about our new president
truly being a compassionate conservative and committing to issues of
particular concern to me, such as education, was misplaced," he said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The war on terrorism has cleared the political landscape of many
issues Democrats like to campaign on. Medicare, managed health care, even
education seem eclipsed by concerns about war and security as the 2002
campaign heats up.</LD>
<LD>   But one hardy perennial that could give Democrats a political boost is
reappearing: Social Security.</LD>
<LD>   The issue has come barreling to the forefront as the collapse of Enron
Corp. has fueled concerns about private retirement programs, and the
bearish market has raised new questions about GOP proposals to let
workers invest some of their payroll taxes in stocks.</LD>
<TE>   Predictably, Democrats want to seize the opportunity to make the
election year case that GOP policies undermine the federal retirement
system. What's more surprising is that some Republicans are helping them
turn attention to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Although most GOP politicians have tried to sidestep the issue, Bush,
in a speech today, is expected to spotlight his proposals to safeguard
retirement programs. And on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas) mounted a full-court press to urge fellow Republicans to renew
the push to partially privatize Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a task for the timid," Armey said in a speech to a
conservative Washington think tank. "We can choose to be the party of
benign neglect or the party of bold change."</TE>
<TE>   After Armey's speech, a group of conservative House Republicans
circulated a letter commending him for attempting to reignite a debate on
Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   But other Republicans cringe. GOP political operatives and vulnerable
incumbents fear that any Social Security initiative will needlessly
invite a political onslaught from Democrats on an issue the party needs
to handle more gingerly.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is a land mine," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.),
chairman of the National Congressional Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>Issue Has Been a Winner for Democrats</TE>
<TE>   From the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal through the 1980s,
Democrats often made significant political gains by portraying
Republicans as hostile to Social Security. The issue clearly contributed
to big Democratic gains in the House in 1982 and helped the party regain
control of the Senate in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The issue lessened in prominence in the 1990s as Republicans became
more cautious about proposing changes in Social Security and more
aggressive about expressing their support for the program. As federal
budget deficits gave way to surpluses in the late 1990s, many Republicans
joined Democrats in embracing the so-called "lockbox" policy--breaking
the federal government of its habit of using Social Security trust funds
for other programs.</TE>
<TE>   That helped neutralize the issue for GOP candidates in the 2000
elections, even as then-candidate Bush made a major issue of his plan to
shore up the retirement program by offering a private-investment option.
He argued that such a change would be needed to ensure Social Security's
solvency as the baby boom generation begins to retire in large numbers in
about 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office, however, Bush has done little to advance his plan
beyond appointing a commission to study the issue. And the return of
budget deficits--caused by an economic recession and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks--seemed to undercut whatever momentum the privatization
plan might have.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Democrats were practically gleeful at Armey's invitation to
reopen a debate on Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens up an opportunity to distinguish between the parties in
terms of who we represent and who they represent," said Rep. Robert T.
Matsui (D-Sacramento).</TE>
<TE>   Added Michael Meehan, a top political advisor with the Democratic
National Committee: "Clearly, it's one of the top election year issues
that will favor Democrats."</TE>
<TE>War Leaves Democrats With Fewer Hot Issues</TE>
<TE>   Republicans argue that Democrats are seizing on Social Security
because they are bereft of other significant campaign issues. The
Democrats' quandary: Bush has earned high marks as a leader in responding
to the Sept. 11 attacks. The economy appears on the rebound. Democrats
have rallied behind the war effort. And while many in the party disagree
with the administration's fiscal policy, they are loathe to propose
repealing the Bush tax cut enacted last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have a platform, so they are going to try to scare
seniors," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, many Republicans remain concerned about the
potential clout of the Social Security issue.</TE>
<TE>   "My 20-year perspective is that we don't have a happy history of
talking about significant changes in Social Security during off-year
elections," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.</TE>
<TE>   He said the issue is especially risky for the GOP in midterm elections
because elderly voters--who tend to care the most about retirement
programs--make up a disproportionate share of the electorate. "All
off-year elections are about three things: the economy, presidential job
approval and seniors," McInturff said.</TE>
<TE>   To counter claims that GOP plans for reforming Social Security would
cut payments to retirees, Armey and other conservative Republicans have
proposed a bill that would send out certificates that "guarantee" the
benefits would never be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The certificates, however, merely express a political pledge; they
would carry no legal standing. When the idea was discussed this week
among GOP leaders, many resisted it as an empty political gesture. Some
warned that rather than accomplish the aim of reassuring voters, the
certificates would needlessly invite Democratic attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's raising the profile of the issue in a year where we're not going
to be dealing with it," said a member of the House GOP leadership who
asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the idea already is being ridiculed by Democrats, who say it
is a gimmick to deflect attention from the recurrence of a budget deficit
that is causing the government once again to dip into Social Security
surpluses to pay for other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) called the certificate plan a "ridiculous
stunt." He said it "only confirms what we already know--[Republicans] are
raiding Social Security and they are nervous about it."</TE>
<TE>   Armey argues that Democratic defenders of the status quo in Social
Security could suffer a political backlash--especially among younger
voters who are increasingly skeptical that the program will survive to
help them in their retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans have nothing to fear when discussing prospects for
reforming Social Security," Armey said in a memo to GOP colleagues
earlier this month. "Americans are anxious to hear each party's ideas for
fixing the system."</TE>

<HD>A Bush and a Dole, Once Again</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president helps an ally--and a former rival--in her
GOP Senate race in N.C. The two families share a rich, interwoven
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>For more than a generation, members of the two families have vied
for prominence in Republican politics, with either a Dole or a Bush
serving on every GOP presidential ticket since 1976.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the family interests dovetailed as President Bush
traveled to North Carolina to help raise money for the Senate candidacy
of Elizabeth Hanford Dole, his erstwhile rival for the 2000 presidential
nomination and wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole.</LD>
<LD>   "Elizabeth is going to make a great United States senator," Bush said
at a luncheon fund-raiser.</LD>
<TE>   Bush broke with tradition in backing Dole. Several other Republicans
are vying for the GOP nomination to succeed Republican Sen. Jesse Helms,
who is retiring, and presidents rarely wade into intraparty contests for
open seats.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision to do so was a measure of the importance of the
November elections, when Republicans hope to overturn the one-seat
Democratic advantage in the Senate (as well as retain their narrow House
majority).</TE>
<TE>   Dole's GOP opponents are little-known and she is heavily favored to
win the May 7 primary. "The Republican elite [in North Carolina] has very
much galvanized behind Dole," including Helms, said Andrew J. Taylor, a
North Carolina State University political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, with his appearance Wednesday, was doing his part to spotlight
the general election campaign, when analysts anticipate that Dole will
face a formidable opponent in Erskine Bowles, a former top aide to
President Clinton who is expected to win the Democratic nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have given Dole substantial leads over Bowles. "Those numbers
suggest she's doing pretty well," said Taylor. "But people really aren't
focused on the race at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Dole without some political troubles. In her early campaigning,
she has been struggling between wooing the state's die-hard Republican
conservatives, whose backing is indispensable in the primary, and its
more moderate general electorate, whose vote she needs to prevail in
November.</TE>
<TE>   She also has some baggage that she must shed. For instance, she
attended a fund-raiser in Houston just nine days after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, when nearly all politicians--including Dole
herself--had declared a moratorium on politicking. She later explained
that she didn't know it was a fund-raiser (which netted her $20,000). To
make matters worse, the luncheon's host was Kenneth L. Lay, the now
discredited former chairman of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   And Dole faces criticism of being something of a carpetbagger.
Although born and raised in North Carolina, she spent nearly her entire
career in Washington, including a stint as Labor secretary in the
administration of Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's event, Dole introduced the current president, and he
gave her a kiss on the cheek both before and after his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush lavished praise on the candidate, telling his audience, "I can't
wait to work with Elizabeth Dole. It's important for this state to send
her to Washington, D.C."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "She's been a long-time friend. I trust her judgment. I know
the integrity she'll bring to the office. . . . She's always loved North
Carolina and she's going to represent you with class and dignity in the
United States Senate."</TE>
<TE>   As has been the case at other GOP fund-raisers he's attended recently,
Bush avoided any overt criticism of Democrats and stressed his commitment
to pursuing the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But he touched upon questions that have been raised about how
vigorously he should work to defeat Democrats who have stood squarely
behind him in the war effort. And in his answer, he defined the stakes in
this year's vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said to me the other day, . . . 'Do you think it's all right
for the president to go campaign?' Yes, I do. I think it will be a lot
easier for me to accomplish what I want to accomplish with [J. Dennis]
Hastert (of Illinois) as speaker of the House of Representatives and
Trent Lott (of Mississippi) as majority leader of the United States
Senate."</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon Bush attended was expected to raise more than $1 million
for Dole, Rep. Robert "Robin" Hayes (R-N.C.) and the state Republican
Party, with the lion's share going to Dole.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's support for Dole annoyed two of the other Republicans seeking
the GOP's Senate nomination, Jim Snyder and Jim Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder, an attorney, wrote the president a letter that said he was
"backing a candidate who was soft on gun control and abortion."</TE>
<TE>   Parker, a physician, said it was "unfair" of Bush to use his
"well-deserved popularity to coerce the people. . .to support a candidate
who lacks the core conservative values they seek."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Black, a Washington-based Republican strategist, said such
comments are unlikely to hurt Dole, who not only enjoys widespread name
recognition in the state but has about $2.5 million in her campaign war
chest--before today's fund-raiser and Bush's enthusiastic endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees in politics, but it sure looks like she going
to win at this stage of the game," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for the 2000 GOP presidential nomination, Dole at one time
was considered Bush's major challenger. But her campaign failed to
generate much support, and she dropped out in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, then a senator from Kansas, gained national prominence
when he was selected as President Ford's running mate in the 1976
campaign. The GOP ticket lost to Jimmy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bob Dole and the elder George Bush sought their party's
presidential nomination in 1980, with Bush ultimately becoming Ronald
Reagan's running mate.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Bob Dole and the elder Bush waged a bitter fight to succeed
Reagan.</TE>

<HD>Russell Yates Tells of a Loving Wife</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Russell "Rusty" Yates has only one family member left to lose. On
Wednesday, he slipped into the witness box to defend his wife, Andrea
Yates, who is on trial for drowning the couple's five children in the
tub.</LD>
<LD>   Russell Yates rocked nervously, averted his eyes and wept as he
described a family crushed by a mental sickness whose severity they
underestimated. Andrea Yates has confessed to killing the children, and
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If her lawyers are unable to
convince the jury she was insane, she could be executed or spend life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   "She's wonderful," Yates told the jury. "I mean, just so involved with
the children. She loved them, held them, read to them, gave them
activities. She was wonderful."</LD>
<TE>   To illustrate Andrea Yates' descent into sickness, defense lawyers
showed silent home videos of happier days: the Yates children watching
monarch butterflies light on milkweed. The Yates children jumping on
their parents' bed while a pregnant Andrea Yates gazes into the mirror,
stroking her swollen belly.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Yates knew his wife's mental history by heart and narrated the
string of doctors, hospitals and mixtures of pills with hardly a
hesitation. Andrea Yates tried to kill herself at least twice. She'd
heard voices. The young mother was discharged from a mental facility one
month before she killed her children. She was in a psychiatrist's office
days before the deaths. During the visit, Rusty Yates testified, the
doctor chided Andrea Yates for thinking "negative thoughts." She'd been
taken off her antipsychotic prescription just weeks before the children
were killed.</TE>
<TE>   When defense lawyer George Parnham asked why the family placed Andrea
Yates in the care of a psychiatrist they didn't particularly trust, her
husband sighed. "I guess at the time, I just saw all psychiatrists as the
same," he replied. "They all had degrees on the wall and--that was my
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   The testimony was filled with similar lamentations. "None of us saw
Andrea as dangerous," Yates said.</TE>
<TE>   "She had her two prior suicide attempts," Parnham pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   "That's true," Rusty said.</TE>
<TE>   "Did that ring any bells?"</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately," Yates replied, "no."</TE>
<TE>   Parnham made no effort to camouflage the darker sides of the Yates
household. He prompted Rusty to read aloud a poem from "Perilous Times,"
a Christian leaflet to which the family subscribed. It was an allegory
about the condemnation of "Modern Mother Worldly," a mother who--beguiled
by society into ignoring the Bible--refuses to punish her children.
"Modern Mother Worldly cast in Hell," Yates read. "Now what becomes of
the children of such a Jezebel?"</TE>
<TE>   Parnham also had Yates describe the months the family spent living in
a cramped, converted Greyhound bus--a vehicle they bought from the same
preacher who penned the newsletter. The boys slept in a makeshift bedroom
in what had been the bus luggage bin. It was during those days that
Andrea Yates first tried to kill herself.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest baby, Mary, was born in November 2000. Andrea Yates had
been sick for years, and the couple knew there was a good chance Yates
might slump back into depression with the birth of another child.</TE>
<TE>   But they had decided to risk it, Rusty Yates explained, because they
thought they'd found a cure for Andrea Yates' depression. They believed
Haldol, a potent antipsychotic drug that had fished Andrea Yates back
from the depths of depression in 1999, could work again.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few months of Mary's birth, Yates was too depressed to talk
or eat. When her husband checked her into a mental hospital, he had to
carry her to the truck, and bend her legs to tuck her inside. About a
month before the children were killed, Yates was unexpectedly discharged
from the hospital, her husband told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates had her final psychiatric appointment June 18. "We'd been
living with this for months," Rusty Yates said. "And I was beaten."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, his children were dead.</TE>

<HD>Election Reform Bill Stalls on Voter ID Demand</HD>
<DH>Senate: Democrats call anti-fraud guidelines sought by GOP
discriminatory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A sudden partisan firefight over a proposal to require proof of
identification from first-time voters threatened Wednesday to torpedo a
Senate bill to upgrade voting systems across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats, opposing the proposal, say it could depress turnout in
areas with large populations of minority or elderly voters, who often do
not have identification handy when they go to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans, decrying lax regulations in some states that allow the
names of dogs and dead people onto voter rolls, say a requirement of a
photo ID, such as a driver's license, or some other verification of
identity and residence, is essential to deter fraud.</LD>
<TE>   In a preliminary vote Wednesday, Democrats prevailed 51-46 as they
advanced an alternative allowing voters to vouch for their identities
with a signature. But the issue was not settled, and Republicans
demonstrated enough strength in the vote to deadlock the Senate
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans beginning a filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said he would yank the election reform legislation from
the floor if he could not get the 60 votes needed to force final action.
The Senate Democratic leadership scheduled a showdown vote for Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot disenfranchise minority voters and older voters who
oftentimes don't have photo IDs," Daschle told reporters. "I would hope
that we could resolve this matter and bring the bill to a conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   But a Republican active in the reform legislation, Sen. Christopher S.
"Kit" Bond of Missouri, shot back: "We see now that it's the Democratic
Party that does not want to stop fraudulent voting. If that's the way
they're going to be, I don't see a lot of prospects for a bill."</TE>
<TE>   The debate laid bare one of the sharpest partisan fault lines in what
has until now been a largely bipartisan movement to overhaul how state
and local officials conduct elections--an issue that came to prominence
in the disputed 2000 presidential election. It also echoed periodic
disputes in California involving dueling allegations of voter fraud and
voter intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Republicans have sought to crack down on fraud while
Democrats have sought to expand the electorate. For example, Republican
Robert K. Dornan charged after his 1996 loss to Democrat Loretta Sanchez
in an Orange County congressional race that groups allied with her had
facilitated illegal voting by noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who won a lengthy battle in the House to enable Sanchez to
claim her seat, countered that Republicans were simply trying to
undermine efforts to encourage voting by immigrants who have become
naturalized U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying the Senate debate is a bill that would enable voters to
cast ballots more easily, ensure that those votes are counted accurately
and prevent assorted forms of polling discrimination and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   It also would earmark $3.4 billion in federal funds to help states
upgrade polling equipment, create statewide voter registration systems
and comply with new standards.</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan compromise in December agreed on an outline of the bill
that would both target fraud and encourage participation--to "make it
easier to vote and tougher to cheat," in the words of Bond, who
participated in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a provision in the bill would require anyone who
registers to vote by mail to show proof of identity when voting for the
first time--whether in person or absentee. Such proof could be a valid
photo ID card issued by a state, or another document that shows the
voter's name and address, such as a utility bill, a government check, a
paycheck or a bank statement.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans contend that such verification would help prevent flagrant
abuses. Bond cited the case of Ritzy Mekler, a mixed-breed dog born in
Los Angeles who was registered to vote in St. Louis in October 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who fail to bring identification to the polls would be able to
cast "provisional" ballots that could be double-checked afterward by
election authorities, proponents of the anti-fraud measure said.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats said that was not good enough. Sens. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) proposed an amendment that would allow
states to verify a voter's identity through signature matching.
Republicans called it a sham. But in Wednesday's action, the Senate
failed to table, or kill, the Schumer-Wyden proposal. That left the
matter in limbo while the Senate considers whether to sustain or end the
filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, voted with their party. The only Republican to break ranks was
Sen. Gordon H. Smith from Oregon, a state that pioneered elections
conducted entirely by mail.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve states--not including California--require voters to verify
their identity at a polling station, according to the Constitution
Project, an organization affiliated with Georgetown University that
tracks election reform. California does, however, require signature
matches to verify the authenticity of mail-in absentee ballots. About 25%
of the California electorate votes by mail, officials estimate.</TE>
<TE>   If the Senate can break through the impasse, there is a good chance
that a major election reform could become law. The House passed its own
version of the bill in December. It differs in several ways from the
Senate measure, but advocates in both chambers have expressed optimism
that those differences can be reconciled. President Bush, who won the
2000 election in an outcome still disputed by some Democrats, has also
expressed support for the reform effort.</TE>
<TE>   But anti-fraud measures are proving unexpectedly difficult to resolve.
Conny McCormack, registrar-recorder for Los Angeles County, said that
election officials nationwide are concerned about any measures that would
require subjective judgments by poll workers on who is eligible to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Conceivably, McCormack said, the anti-fraud measures supported by
Republican senators could lead poll workers to give the benefit of the
doubt to voters they know while giving closer scrutiny to those they
don't--many of them immigrants, or younger or lower-income voters. "It's
discriminatory on its face," she said.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The government is backing away from its goal of getting 90% of
Americans to wear seat belts by 2005, contending that the level set in
the Clinton administration is too unrealistic.</LD>
<LD>   The new goal is 78% by 2003, compared with 87% envisioned under the
Clinton plan. Federal regulators will decide after 2003 whether to set
new goals.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton administration's 10-year plan has proved too ambitious,
Jeffrey W. Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, told a Senate Appropriations panel. Seat belt use was a
record 73% in 2001, but below the goal of 86%. he said.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) who leads the transportation subcommittee,
criticized the decision for lowering expectations.</TE>
<TE>   States set belt laws but the federal government can encourage them to
toughen legislation.</TE>

<HD>Mont. Militia Plotted to Kill Officials, Prosecutors Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: An informant directs authorities to a huge weapon cache and
an alleged 'hit list.' Two suspects are arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>A major weapon stash and a purported hit list targeting local
government officials have been uncovered in northern Montana, part of
what authorities alleged Wednesday was an anti-government plot being
developed by a shadowy local militia group.</LD>
<LD>   In a court hearing in Kalispell, Mont., prosecutors said thousands of
rounds of ammunition, firearms and booby traps were found near the home
of one of two suspects arrested in the case, along with lists naming
local police officers, judges and other officials.</LD>
<LD>   Already facing charges in the case are David Burgert, 38, a longtime
local anti-government activist thought to be the ringleader in the case,
and Tracy Brockway, 32, charged with obstruction of justice for aiding
Burgert.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they expect other arrests as the investigation continues.</TE>
<TE>   An informant told police the group had plans to assassinate those
named on the list with the goal of triggering a wider conflict in which
militia members from throughout the West would stand against the National
Guard and international troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Project Seven"--reportedly named so because Montana designates
Flathead its seventh county--is the latest in a series of anti-government
patriot groups that have sprung up in recent years throughout the rural
West. Those groups are dedicated to protecting what is seen as an erosion
of constitutional rights, often fueled by resentment over environmentally
based land use planning and restrictions on gun ownership.</TE>
<TE>   But the extent of the weapon cache discovered in trailers outside
Kalispell was unusual, law enforcement officials said. "I'm talking
24-foot camper trailers loaded with ammunition--25 [thousand] to 30,000
rounds--illegal automatic machine guns, snare bombs, survival gear,"
Flathead County Sheriff Jim Dupont said.</TE>
<TE>   Police also found computers that contained encrypted information,
along with lists containing the names of several local judges, the
sheriff, and two deputy district attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't say, 'Here's a list of people to kill,' but based on the
information from the informant, it certainly looked like hit lists to
us," Dupont said. "The basic plan was to assassinate most of the law
enforcement in the county, and that would bring in the National Guard,
and they would kill all those guys, which would trigger NATO and the U.N.
That would create a revolution, all the militias from around the country
would come in to defend them, and David Burgert would be president, I
guess. I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Burgert was already facing charges of assaulting police officers in
two previous cases when he disappeared on the day of his court hearing in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, Burgert was accused of assaulting a man who later
identified himself as a member of Project Seven and who went to police
with a detailed account of the group's plans and whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Police later tracked Burgert to the home of Brockway, a cleaning woman
at the Whitefish Police Department, and pursued him into the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Burgert was arrested after a 24-hour standoff; the weapons were found
in subsequent searches of Brockway's property.</TE>
<TE>   "Needless to say, we have a lot of information pointing to a
conspiracy of this group to possibly do harm to public officials.
Everything the informant's told us so far has been absolutely true,"
Dupont said.</TE>
<TE>   "What their connection is outside of our county and outside the state,
we don't know. That's why the FBI is here assisting us with that," the
sheriff added.</TE>
<TE>   In a court hearing Tuesday, Brockway's lawyer, Gary Doran, persuaded a
judge to reduce her bond to $100,000. "They want her to rot in jail until
she will tell them anything they want her to say," Doran complained.</TE>

<HD>Bush Team to Oppose Democrats' Fuel Standard Plan</HD>
<DH>Energy: The proposal would mandate a 35 mpg average for all
vehicles by 2013. The White House doesn't want specific levels imposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration today will announce that it opposes a
Democratic proposal to require dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency
for cars and trucks sold in the U.S., a move sharpening the partisan
divide over energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   While the Democratic plan would mandate specific fuel economy
increases over the next decade, the White House will urge that Congress
instead authorize the Department of Transportation to set the standards
later on, according to a senior White House official.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists and many Democrats fear such a process would provide
too much leverage to the auto industry and undercut efforts to impose
tougher standards. But the idea could have considerable appeal to
Democrats from automobile-manufacturing states, who are facing intense
resistance to the mandated increase from auto companies and the United
Auto Workers.</LD>
<TE>   The pending White House announcement means that Bush and Democratic
leaders have each targeted the other's top priority in the energy bill
the Senate is expected to start debating in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats strongly oppose Bush's push to open a portion of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. And the White House is
privately acknowledging that it does not now have the votes to break a
threatened Democratic filibuster against the drilling proposal, contained
in a bill the House passed last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably as fluid a vote count as they get," said the
administration official. "But we feel at this point there are 53 to 55
votes for" Arctic drilling.</TE>
<TE>   That's well short of the 60 Senate votes it would take to break a
filibuster against the drilling, as promised by Sen. John F. Kerry
(D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, along with Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), is also the
principal author of the fuel economy standards called for in the
Democratic bill. That proposal would require cars and SUVs sold in the
U.S. to reach an average performance of 35 miles per gallon by 2013--the
most dramatic change in the program since the fuel economy standards were
first signed into law by President Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger cars currently must meet a "corporate average fuel economy,"
or CAFE, standard of 27.5 mpg. Light trucks, including SUVs, are
permitted to meet an average of 20.7 mpg. Car makers are allowed to
average the standard across their fleets, so smaller cars can offset the
guzzlers.</TE>
<TE>   Because SUVs and pickups make up an increasing share of new vehicles
sold, the overall fuel economy performance for 2001 model year vehicles
has dropped to about 20.4 miles per gallon, the lowest level since 1980,
according to government studies.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say tougher fuel-economy standards will do more to
reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil than Bush's priority of opening up
a portion of the Arctic refuge to drilling; sponsors project that the new
standards would eventually save as much as 1.6 million barrels of oil a
day, as much as the U.S. now imports from Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also say tougher fuel standards will reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   But the auto industry and the auto workers union have argued that
requiring rapid increases in fuel economy could cost jobs and endanger
passenger safety by requiring the manufacturers to produce lighter cars.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement to be released today, the administration will argue
that while some increase in the standards is justified, it would be
inappropriate for Congress to write specific levels into law.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably can be an increase, and we support an increase," said
the White House official. "But we do have real concerns about any
arbitrary increase that doesn't recognize safety concerns. The question
on CAFE is to how much flexibility they are going to allow for the
[Transportation] Department to do a deliberative process . . . based on
the best data and science."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the higher standards believe that leaving the issue
to the department would give the auto industry an inside track on
preventing significant change.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another move in a regrettable shell game to conceal the fact
that the administration and the auto industry are joined at the hip,
refusing to embrace fuel efficiency as a way to help break our dependence
on foreign oil," Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leading advocate of tougher
standards, said, "For years nothing has been done to improve fuel
efficiency and if we leave it in the hands of an agency, I don't believe
anything additional will be done."</TE>
<TE>   But the administration proposal could prove attractive to wavering
Democrats from states with a large auto manufacturing presence. Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.) has reportedly been crafting a similar provision as an
alternative to the Kerry-Hollings plan.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry has argued for leaving the decision on fuel
standards with the Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, and it reacted favorably to Bush's position.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reconciled to [safety administration officials] setting" the
level, said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers. "We may not like the number that they come out with, but
at least they're going to gather data to base a number on, as opposed to
plucking a number out of the air."</TE>
<TE>   The earliest that the federal agency could put tougher fuel-economy
standards in effect would be for model year 2005 because of the time
required to study the issue, including taking public comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Kerry acknowledged that his proposed increase faces "an
uphill battle."</TE>
<TE>   "Do we have the votes today to pass this? The answer is probably not,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, House Democrats from auto-producing states joined a
majority of Republicans to decisively kill an amendment requiring
sport-utility vehicles, minivans and pickups to achieve a 27.5 mpg
average by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   The House-approved energy bill instead calls for a 5-billion-gallon
reduction in gasoline use by SUVs, minivans and pickups over the next six
years. Critics say that standard would raise gas mileage by only about 1
mpg.</TE>
<TE>   Both the administration and Democratic leaders have indicated that
they would oppose one potential way to break the legislative impasse: a
compromise that allowed some expanded drilling within the Arctic refuge
for some increase in fuel economy standards.</TE>

<HD>High Court Hears 'Threat-to-Self' Disability Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Supreme Court justices struggled Wednesday with whether job
applicants with a disease or a disability have a right to be hired for a
job that might endanger their life or health.</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand, the federal law governing disabled workers says that
qualified applicants with a disease or an impairment are entitled to be
hired on an equal basis with other job-seekers.</LD>
<LD>   While the law makes an exception for disabled or impaired workers who
would pose a "direct threat" to the health or safety of others--for
example, a police officer who fails to remain alert on duty because of an
inability to control diabetes--it makes no exception for disabled or
impaired individuals whose job might endanger only themselves.</LD>
<TE>   However, the justices wondered how employers could be forced to hire a
worker who is determined to undertake a dangerous risk to himself. They
cited, as one example, an iron worker who suffers dizzy spells but
nonetheless wants to work on a high-rise building.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy noted that society wants employers to be
considerate of their workers. But "you want the employer to take a
position that is completely barbarous," he told an attorney for a Los
Angeles man who had sought a job at an oil refinery but was rejected
after a pre-employment physical discovered a liver ailment.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Echazabal was turned down for a job at the Chevron refinery in
El Segundo because he had hepatitis C, a chronic, noninfectious liver
disease that can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. The company's
doctors said exposure to the chemicals and solvents at the plant might
damage his liver and threaten his life.</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal sued Chevron under the Americans with Disabilities Act,
contending that the company had exaggerated his health problems. And
beyond that, he maintained that it was his decision, not the company's,
whether to work in a job that might put his health at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with me," Echazabal told reporters outside the
court Wednesday. He said he has been in good health and was fully capable
of doing the job at the refinery.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the courtroom, the justices seemed to agree with him on that
point.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say he was not qualified when he had worked there for
more than 20 years," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told a lawyer for
Chevron.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1972, Echazabal had done various maintenance jobs at the El
Segundo refinery for a private contractor. He sought a full-time job with
Chevron in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Several justices said they were not convinced that Echazabal's liver
ailment was as serious as Chevron's doctors suggested. They said they
might ask U.S. District Judge Lourdes Baird in Los Angeles to reconsider
the conflicting medical opinions in the case. Two medical experts said
Echazabal's liver could withstand the atmosphere at the refinery, but
Baird dismissed the case anyway.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the justices focused on the broad legal issue
raised by the case of Chevron vs. Echazabal, 00-1406.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, siding with Echazabal, said the
disability-rights law put the decision in the hands of the worker.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't want to kill themselves. I suspect this is really a
question of how risky it is . . . and who decides," Breyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Chevron's lawyer, Stephen M. Shapiro, replied that employers think
"safety first. That's the motto. . . . If you recognize a hazard, you
can't send someone into that." Moreover, employers could be sued or even
prosecuted criminally if they expose a worker to a known danger, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Harvard Law School professor Samuel R. Bagenstos, who argued on
behalf of Echazabal, said Congress did not authorize the use of a
"threat-to-self standard" by employers.</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal faces only "a small risk" of health trouble if he worked at
the refinery, he said, citing the opinions of several doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is who gets to decide. We believe Congress left the
decision in the hands of the employee," Bagenstos said.</TE>
<TE>   The justices sounded closely split on the issue. They have several
months to hand down a decision.</TE>

<LD>"Terror War Budget May Fall Short" (Feb. 26) advised that the cost
for anti-terrorism for the year 2002 would be $30 billion. I would
suggest that the figure is grossly distorted. The people in the
military would still be in the military, still being paid and
compensated. Much of the equipment would be used for training,
consequently maintenance costs would still be incurred. I would guess
that additional personnel for the CIA, etc., are being hired, but $30
billion worth? How can we get anything accurate? Asking hasn't
worked.</LD>
