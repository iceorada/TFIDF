<HD>Fire Can't Scorch His Soul</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Severely injured Phoenix policeman struggles to
regain a semblance of his former life. At first, he's disconsolate.
But then he finds hope.</DH>
<SE>THE STORY SO FAR: Phoenix police officer Jason Schechterle,
who suffered disfiguring burns in a car crash, received skin grafts
and other surgery on his face, head and hands. His eyes, their lids
seared away, were sewn shut for months as he recovered. He has just
begun to see again. Last in a weekly series</SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Without hesitating, Jason Schechterle raised his hands to his face.
Through a slit the size of a pinhole in his scabbed left eye, he
could see for the first time the damage the fire had done.</LD>
<LD>   On his left hand, his first two fingers were amputated at the
knuckles. His thumb was completely gone, and his ring finger was
permanently bent at the tip. On his right hand, every finger but his
thumb was dislocated and stuck at a 90-degree angle. He couldn't
straighten them at all.</LD>
<LD>   Both were covered with bulbous growths almost as big as tennis
balls, from when doctors had surgically implanted his hands into his
abdomen to help regrow burned-off tissue.</LD>
<TE>   Jason broke down again. He was disgusted, ashamed and petrified of
what his life had become. He had been a police officer only 14
months. Would he be able to hold a gun with these paws? Could he
still be a cop? And what about all the other things he loved? Could
he golf with his dad? Play catch with his son?</TE>
<TE>   "How can you even hold my hand?" he asked his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I love your hands," Suzie Schechterle said, kissing them.</TE>
<TE>   It had been four months since the accident that left him with
disfiguring burns to his head, face and hands, and Jason was only
beginning to grasp the extent of his injuries. He tried to examine
his face, but with his right eye sewn shut, his left barely open and
his corneas scarred, he couldn't see much.</TE>
<TE>   The face would have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason was sent home from the rehabilitation center on Aug. 17,
nearly five months after the accident. Suzie fed him, bathed him,
brushed his teeth, put him to bed, turned the TV on and off, even
changed his bandages.</TE>
<TE>   The skin graft sites stung like a severe sunburn during every
dressing change. Jason's skin was so sensitive that showers were like
needles raining down on him.</TE>
<TE>   He felt like a child and cried constantly.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day Suzie insisted he feed himself. "I know you can do
it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   He was furious, but he did it.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later she suggested he try the bathroom alone. He was
furious, but he did that too.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Jason was getting the Gatorade out of the fridge, balancing
the bottle between his ravaged hands. He couldn't open the lid, but
he could pour.</TE>
<TE>   By confronting his limitations, he started to deal with them. He
got tennis shoes with zippers and began wearing workout pants without
drawstrings or buttons. As he progressed, the crying stopped.</TE>
<TE>   His days were consumed with therapy, doctors' appointments and
more surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors went forward with the amputation of Jason's left index
finger to replace his thumb. They put his right hand in a temporary
cast to try to straighten his dislocated fingers. He'd need at least
four more operations for joint and tendon transplants, and to
relocate his fingers.</TE>
<TE>   With each revelation, Jason understood more clearly that he would
not get full use back of his hands, that he probably would never
again hold a gun as a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   The eye doctor told him corneal transplants were likely because of
the scarring. His eyesight slowly improved to where he could read a
newspaper if he held it close, and he bought a big-screen TV.</TE>
<TE>   And what about his face? The doctors had discussed reconstruction:
more surgeries, many options. All of that he couldn't address until
he finally saw it for himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It happened one October morning. Jason got out of bed and went
into the bathroom as usual, only on this day his eyesight seemed
better.</TE>
<TE>   Jason had caught glimpses of his face, but never looked close-up.
On this day, seeing his outline in the bathroom mirror, he moved
closer, then leaned in until his face almost touched the glass.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling his way as he stared, he took it all in, one section at a
time. The right ear was completely gone. The left had a bit of lobe
left. The nose looked like a shaven stump. His bald head, which Jason
had worried would look like an egg, seemed flat instead.</TE>
<TE>   He was looking at a stranger, at someone whose entire face had
simply been erased. He was a curiosity, even to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa," he thought. "Look at that."</TE>
<TE>   Then, after 10 minutes, he was done. There were no tears, not like
the time he saw his hands. He didn't even tell Suzie until later that
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a really good look at myself today," he said. "It was just
about what I'd expected."</TE>
<TE>   For months, Jason had lived with the knowledge that he was
deformed. He had tried for so long to imagine what the burns had
done, that when he finally saw his face for himself, it wasn't as bad
as the pictures he'd imagined. It certainly wasn't as shocking as his
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he longed for his old self. When he dreamed, it was
of the Jason before the accident--strong and sure and handsome. And
when the doctors told him he would never wrinkle or gray, he wondered
what he would have looked like as an old man.</TE>
<TE>   He missed the man he was, and the man he would never be.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of burden was it for Suzie to be married to someone who
looked like this? He pondered that sometimes but knew she'd have left
long ago if she didn't really want to be there.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, he worried for the children. Would other kids tease them
because their daddy didn't look normal? Would they themselves ever
come to embrace the new Jason?</TE>
<TE>   Kiley, Jason's 7-year-old stepdaughter, had grown used to his
injuries, although she still shied away from hugs. For Zane, his son,
acceptance was harder to come by.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The day before Thanksgiving, the local TV news featured a story
about Jason's recovery. An old photograph of him in his police
uniform, smiling before an American flag, filled the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Zane, now 3, walked into the living room just then. He stopped in
his tracks, transfixed by the face.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey!" he exclaimed. "That's my daddy!"</TE>
<TE>   No more than a foot away, Jason watched from his favorite chair.
He quietly studied the boy by the television, the boy whose own image
mirrored the one in the box.</TE>
<TE>   "Who am I?" he asked his son.</TE>
<TE>   Zane turned to the voice. It was familiar, but he wasn't sure who
this man was. He remained quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I your daddy?" Jason asked.</TE>
<TE>   Zane examined him some more, but his mind couldn't sort things
out. Finally, he decided.</TE>
<TE>   "No," the boy replied. "That's my daddy." And he turned back to
the TV.</TE>
<TE>   Jason's heart sank. He'd been home three months, and he still
wasn't Daddy.</TE>
<TE>   If his own son viewed him as a stranger, how would the rest of the
world react?</TE>
<TE>   For the first few months back home, Jason's life revolved around
only an inner circle of friends and family, and the doctors and
therapists who knew his injuries well.</TE>
<TE>   In December, for the first time, he ventured out--to a police
banquet to accept an award. He worried his old colleagues would
recoil. As it turned out, they not only told him how happy they were
to see him, they hugged him, touched him. Jason's confidence grew.</TE>
<TE>   Not long afterward, Suzie took him to a movie. He started doing
television interviews, and he was asked to carry the Olympic torch
through Phoenix. He visited his old precinct, spoke to a high school
assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere he went, strangers would walk up and shake his deformed
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed for you," they'd say. "You're an inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Jason began to feel a deep change in himself.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists will tell you the face is your identity. The face is
your personality. The face is you. To overcome an injury so
disfiguring in a society obsessed with appearance, victims must come
to believe it is themselves who matter, not their face. Their soul
becomes their identity.</TE>
<TE>   Jason was shaped by his roles as husband and father and police
officer. After the fire, he had to determine how he fit into those
roles as a changed Jason.</TE>
<TE>   He discovered, gradually, that he could go out with his wife--and,
yes, hold her hand--even if some people stared. He could help his
daughter with homework, even if he had to hold the notebook close so
his damaged eyes could see.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he couldn't be a cop on the streets, but he could talk to
students and other cops about his ordeal. That mattered too.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what a lot of people think," he says. "They look at my
face and think, 'Oh, I couldn't live like that.' I probably wouldn't
have wanted to be saved that night either had I been awake and
conscious.</TE>
<TE>   "But now, I can still have my life, just like I had it before. I
can still laugh. I can still talk. I'm still able to function with my
kids. Those firefighters and doctors did me a huge favor. They gave
me a chance to be something. And I'm still very proud of who I am."</TE>
<TE>   The fire stole his face, but Jason Schechterle's soul is intact.
He has learned that. In time, others come to see it as well.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after New Year's, the family piled into the living
room. Suzie was taking ornaments off the Christmas tree while Kiley
and Zane played with the decorations. Jason was in his favorite
chair.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Zane spotted their tree topper--an angel with a photo
inside, showing Jason in his police uniform. The same photograph he
had seen on the news only a month before.</TE>
<TE>   He picked up the picture, and walked over to Jason.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Daddy," Zane said. "This is you."</TE>
<TE>   Jason glanced at the photo, then back at the boy he once
resembled.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he replied. "That is me."</TE>
<TE>   And as his son went back to playing, the man with no face sat back
in his chair and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Epilogue</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schechterle plans to return to the police department, most
likely in the public information office, this summer, well ahead of
his goal of three years set when he left the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The cab driver who hit Jason had suffered an epileptic seizure. He
had been involved in four prior seizure-related accidents and
shouldn't have been driving, according to testimony at his trial. He
was convicted of aggravated assault for injuring Jason and passenger
Lawrence Tracy, who suffered broken ribs. The cab driver was
sentenced to 12 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Jason's recovery continues. He can take a shirt off over his head,
shower alone, hold a 44-ounce drink. He can even play catch with
Zane, after teaching his remade hands to hold a ball.</TE>
<TE>   He has met with specialists and plans to replace his nose and ears
with prosthetics, but he doesn't want to undergo years of facial
reconstruction. He'd rather focus on his hands and his eyes--on
function, rather than appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong," he says. "I miss my face. But while my
appearance matters, it helps that I have a beautiful wife who looks
at me like she used to, is affectionate to me like she used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "If she doesn't care, why should I?"</TE>
<TE>   One day in March, almost a year after the accident, Suzie called
Jason on the cell phone on his way to therapy. She had some news.</TE>
<TE>   The test was positive. Their baby is due in November.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Firefighters Find Faith, Fealty in Football</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: Despite grief, they kept playing. To quit would
be to give in to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With game time approaching, Coach Sterling Alves asked the reporters
in the locker room to leave.</LD>
<LD>   About 80 large men, New York firefighters suited up this day for
football, gathered in a semicircle around him. Alves, a 23-year fire
department veteran, kept his remarks brief. He told them to play hard
but to be proud whether they won or lost.</LD>
<LD>   They were there, he said, because fans wanted to honor them as
firefighters, not football players.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't take much courage to play a football game," he said.
"It takes courage to be on the 40th floor of tower one, when you know
tower No. 2 just came down."</TE>
<TE>   As the players filed out, they reached up to touch a replica of
the "Play Like a Champion Today" sign, from Notre Dame, which hung
over the doorway. It once belonged to Durrell "Bronko" Pearsall of
Rescue 4, a team captain last year. Now, it was decorated with 22
memorial cards and photos, including Pearsall's.</TE>
<TE>   Some players just slapped the bottom of the sign for luck; others
picked out individual faces to touch more reverently.</TE>
<TE>   It helped -- knowing they were playing for their lost brethren.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Engine 216 from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rolled up to
the World Trade Center soon after the second plane hit.</TE>
<TE>   One of the firefighters who jumped off was Danny Suhr, a 5-11,
250-pound linebacker who manhandled blockers for 11 seasons on the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I always looked up to him," said Steve Orr, a childhood friend
who was a team co-captain with Suhr.</TE>
<TE>   But Suhr became the department's first casualty. As he rushed
toward the north tower lobby, he was struck by a falling body.</TE>
<TE>   Orr couldn't believe it. He went looking for Suhr's younger
brother, Chris, also a firefighter. He ran into Mike Stackpole of
Squad 1, the team's defensive coordinator. Orr had grown up on the
same block as Mike Stackpole and his older brother, Timothy, a
department captain who'd played football as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost Timmy," Mike Stackpole told him.</TE>
<TE>   Orr was reeling. "The first two people I heard were killed [I'd
known] my whole life," he said later.</TE>
<TE>   As the day progressed, FDNY players compiled mental lists of
missing teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: Pearsall, an offensive lineman and the team jokester;
Pat Lyons of Squad 252, a quarterback and the team's fiercest
competitor; Tarel Coleman, also in 252, a defensive back; Tommy
Cullen of Squad 41, a quarterback; Tommy Foley of Rescue 3, a
defensive back and once one of People Magazine's "Sexiest Men Alive";
Keith Glascoe of Ladder 21, a tight end who'd nearly made the Jets;
and Billy Johnston of Engine 6, the team's kicker.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Within the FDNY, there are firehouse softball and basketball
teams. Rugby, lacrosse and boxing enthusiasts have clubs. Then there
are the department-wide teams in baseball, hockey and football, which
match up against police and fire teams across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the department's teams, football suffered the most grievous
losses on Sept. 11. Of the 343 firefighters lost, seven were active
players and 15 were alumni.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the lost players were members of the department's elite
rescue and emergency squads. Football players, agile, tough and
aggressive, are perfect for such units.</TE>
<TE>   Suhr's funeral was the first. Pudgie Walsh, the team's founder and
coach for almost three decades, called him "a man's man."</TE>
<TE>   Bronko Pearsall's service was probably the largest. Pearsall had
been the team's biggest personality, leading his teammates after
every game in singing "The Wild Rover," a joyous Irish drinking song.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of firefighters lined Fifth Avenue as his coffin was
marched into St. Patrick's Cathedral. Linebacker Mike Meyers told
mourners that Bronko, a devoted Notre Dame fan, had played like a
champion on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks that followed players attended so many more services,
often as a team. Football didn't seem to matter.</TE>
<TE>   At Tommy Foley's funeral, a group of players found themselves
together outside a packed church. Orr told his teammates that he
didn't want to play anymore. Coming from such a fiery competitor, it
might have sounded strange. But they understood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the military campaign in Afghanistan geared up in October, a
resolve began to form. Not playing would be like surrender, said
Woody McHale, 39, a fire marshal and the senior man on the team with
13 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody shook our tradition," said McHale, a muscular 270-pound
tackle, one of the team's most emotional players. "Somebody came in
here and tried to change our way of life.... So playing football is
like thumbing our noses at them."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 28, at a Knights of Columbus Hall in Queens, players and
alumni assembled. It had been almost 30 years since Pudgie Walsh, a
firefighter and semipro coach, first got a call from a police officer
friend, asking if he'd like to organize a game between departments.
Now they were deciding whether the team would continue.</TE>
<TE>   No vote was really necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an option," said Alves later. "It's almost like a
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The football team had always raised money for the department's
widows' and children's fund. There were many more to support now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   February brought the first workout. More than 110 firefighters
filled the brightly lit gymnasium, stunning the team's 25 returning
veterans. In years past, sometimes they'd struggled to scrape
together 40. Orr, a captain last year, ambled about, reading the new
players' minds: "They're thinking, who's this gray-haired short guy?"</TE>
<TE>   As the offensive line assembled for drills, McHale felt a surge of
territoriality as he glanced around at the unfamiliar faces. "Don't
think you can replace a Bronko Pearsall or a Brian Bilcher," he
thought to himself.</TE>
<TE>   On a foggy evening in late March, the team opened against a
semipro team in Brooklyn. As players lined up for the national
anthem, the twin beams of light from ground zero glowed faintly in
the distance.</TE>
<TE>   On the team's second drive, Joe Harris, a former college
quarterback who rejoined the squad after an eight-year layoff, threw
a fade to a wide-open receiver in the end zone. It was the game's
only score.</TE>
<TE>   It was a promising start.</TE>
<TE>   McHale was upset at his own performance. He might have been
distracted, he said later, not hearing Lyons' familiar cadence at the
line, Bronko's barking on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Alves felt a responsibility to be a healer as
well as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   He had lost six men in his house, Squad 252. He sought counseling
and urged his players to do the same. He also encouraged them to
speak up about their feelings. Healing emotional wounds doesn't come
by just playing, he said later. It comes in talking things through
with teammates who become as close as brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Football is just an extended family," he said. "It's like a big
firehouse."</TE>
<TE>   Road trips were when players bonded. After playing mostly locally,
the team joined the National Public Safety Football League in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the team traveled first to San Diego. Mike Meyers
brought a picture of Bronko and stuck it up in his hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   The FDNY team trounced the South Bay Blue Knights, law enforcement
officers from Los Angeles County, 26-0.</TE>
<TE>   The New York team lost the following week against the Orlando,
Fla., police department, turning the ball over seven times. Even so,
the score was close, 14-12.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a narrow win over the Orange County (Calif.) Lawmen. On
the sidelines, players talked about last year, when Lyons came off
the bench and delivered a comeback victory.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilt team was holding its own, but they sorely missed Billy
Johnston, last year's kicker. Coaches sent a message out to the
firehouses, asking for help.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, side jobs had kept Jerry O'Riordan, a former
Division III All-American place kicker, from playing. This time, he
called his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I gotta go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Against the New York City Corrections team, O'Riordan was the
center of attention, chipping in a 22-yard field goal and booming a
40-yarder into the wind to end the game, 20-0.</TE>
<TE>   The team had a won-lost record of 4-1, with one game left, against
the NYPD.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The police-fire football game--the Finest versus the Bravest--was
always a grudge match.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the usual competitiveness had an added edge. Animosity
lingered from clashes in the fall between police officers and
firefighters at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   On a bright May afternoon a few weeks ago, the teams met in Giants
Stadium before 15,000 fans. Before the game, the FDNY team presented
framed jerseys of each fallen player to his family.</TE>
<TE>   The game turned out to be disappointing for the FDNY. Their
offense never really got on track. Final score: NYPD 10, FDNY 0.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the mood was subdued. Several veterans, including Orr,
who was named most valuable player, addressed the team. They had no
regrets. By resurrecting the devastated team, they said, they'd made
new friends and honored the memory of their old ones.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was Alves' turn to talk. It doesn't have to end here, the
coach said. "We can become a better team, a better family," next
year.</TE>
<TE>   He was proud of how they'd pulled together, he said later, proud
of how they'd "learned to move on together."</TE>
<TE>   The players gathered in the center of the locker room, arms around
each other. Tattooed on many biceps was "343," the number of men the
FDNY lost on Sept. 11. One player held up the "Play Like a Champion"
sign.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, they sang "The Wild Rover," Bronko's song. They'd sung
it all season after games, and it had taken on new meaning. Part
therapy. Part tribute.</TE>
<TE>   "For Bronko, boys," one player said, and they belted out the
words.</TE>

<HD>China's Great Leap Backward--to Confucius</HD>
<DH>Philosophy: Once banned by the Communist Party, his ancient
teachings are being revived in an effort to instill morality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>XIWENGZHUANG, China</DL>
<LD>The children sit ramrod straight at their desks, hands clasped behind
their backs as, on teacher's cue, they shout their lesson in unison:</LD>
<LD>   "A young man should serve his parents at home and be respectful to
elders outside his home!"</LD>
<LD>   The words are 2,500 years old; the author is Confucius, China's
greatest philosopher, who is making a comeback from the communist
junkyard despite originating in an era when silk-robed scholars
served China's emperors.</LD>
<TE>   But these junior high students are the children of modern
rulers--Communist Party officials and businessmen. And the setting,
the Shengtao Experimental School in the mountains two hours north of
Beijing, is the new wave in Chinese education.</TE>
<TE>   Confucianism was discarded more than 50 years ago as medieval,
oppressive and unfit for the new communist order. Its revival,
experts say, reflects growing ethnic pride, as well as fear that
rising incomes are making Chinese too materialistic.</TE>
<TE>   "China is struggling to fill a moral and ethical void. That's the
price we have to pay for a modern economy and country," said Meng
Fanhua, a specialist on contemporary culture at the China Academy of
Social Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Confucius--or Kongfuzi in Chinese--taught in his "Analects" that a
peaceful and prosperous society was possible if everyone from pauper
to prince adhered to the same virtues of honesty, courtesy and
loyalty. A schoolteacher, author and government advisor, he died in
479 B.C., but his philosophy thrived. For more than two millennia
afterward, his ethics guided all aspects of Chinese life, from
rearing children to ruling empires.</TE>
<TE>   But as China lagged behind the West, the ancient moral code was
attacked as a shackle on progress. After 1949, the communists reviled
Confucius as an enemy of the people.</TE>
<TE>   No longer. Since the late 1990s, Beijing has allowed hundreds of
public schools to offer classes in Confucianism, experts say. That's
not much in a country of 1.3 billion people, and while most of the
schools are free, Shengtao school charges the equivalent of $2,000 a
year, three times China's urban annual income per person. So
enrollment is limited to wealthy families.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the very existence of Confucian studies reflects a new
tolerance on the part of the Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership is turning increasingly to ethnic identity and away
from leftist ideology to justify its own rule. The Confucian virtue
of loyalty to a ruler also has a clear appeal for the authoritarian
regime.</TE>
<TE>   "Strengthen moral-building for little citizens," Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said in a June 4 speech backing a national program to
increase ethical education in schools, according to the official
Xinhua News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 2 million students have already taken classes in Confucian
morality, said Guo Qijia, deputy director of the China Confucius
Society.</TE>
<TE>   And demand keeps rising. The society--itself backed by the
Ministry of Education--gets queries almost every day from schools
that want to add courses in Confucian ethics, Guo said.</TE>
<TE>   Guo said Confucianism's message resonates in a society that is
looking for a moral compass after first abandoning traditional values
for radical Marxism, then Marxism for market-oriented reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Educators also say parents are increasingly interested in
instilling ethnic pride in their children. Liu Yinfang, the matronly
55-year-old principal of Shengtao School, said the school teaches
youth to cherish China's own cultural achievements rather than
mimicking those of foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 5,000 years of history," she said. "Why do we keep
relying on foreign cultures?"</TE>
<TE>   In Shengtao's schoolyard, boys in blue uniforms and girls in pink
cried "Huh! Huh!" as they practiced kung fu kicks, punches and
blocks. The sound of an "erhu," a traditional Chinese stringed
instrument, drifted from one classroom. In another room, students
guided black brushes over white rice paper in calligraphy exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Shengtao, which Liu helped found four years ago, is
the only school in China to devote its curriculum almost entirely to
Confucianism and other traditional subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching methods are old-fashioned as well. Writings by Confucius
and other ancient Chinese philosophers are memorized and recited,
often without any explanation by teachers.</TE>
<TE>   But in a concession to the 21st century, Shengtao does have a lab
full of new computers. English is also taught--using translations of
Confucian texts and traditional Chinese poems.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taught ethnicity comes first, the world second. Young
people must know more about Chinese culture," said Gao Xinwo, a
14-year-old girl in eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Liu said the school's elementary and junior high students come
from all over China. There are only 56 students, but Liu said
interest is growing so rapidly that new buildings will soon be added
to house a high school.</TE>
<TE>   But she also conceded that the school's draw will remain limited.
Most Chinese parents, she said, want their children to learn skills
more valued in the world marketplace--computer languages, English,
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unrealistic to think Confucius could defeat McDonald's, the
NBA and Hollywood movies," said Meng, the culture expert. "We really
can't go back. We have to keep moving ahead."</TE>

<HD>Sectarian Enmity on Parade Again in N. Ireland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN POGATCHNIK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- Northern Ireland's sectarian marching
season opened Friday with an air of menace and trepidation as more
than 1,000 Protestants paraded through divided north Belfast.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred riot police backed by British soldiers and
surveillance helicopters guarded the parade by the Orange Order, a
conservative Protestant fraternal group, and watched Catholics along
the parade route holding placards denouncing Orangemen and police.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic leaders vowed to keep their protest peaceful, but youths
threw stones and bottles over police lines as the parade passed a
high-rise Catholic welfare project. No serious injuries were
reported.</LD>
<TE>   The Orangemen, whose parades for the last two centuries have
provoked Catholic resentment and fear, plan their biggest summertime
demonstrations each July 12, the anniversary of a 17th-century
military victory over Catholic forces.</TE>
<TE>   Two other clash-prone marches are scheduled for the coming two
weekends in Belfast and Portadown.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Catholics led by Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican
Army-linked party, have blockaded Protestant parades in and around
Catholic areas. That strategy has forced British security forces to
take sides--either by clubbing Catholics off the disputed roadways
or, more commonly, clashing with Protestants.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians on both sides worry that this marching season could
prove particularly violent, given the recent months of sporadic
violence in polarized parts of Belfast, especially its north.</TE>
<TE>   That violence partly reflects growing Protestant opposition to the
1998 peace accord giving Sinn Fein a role in a joint
Catholic-Protestant government for this British territory.</TE>
<TE>   A British-appointed Parades Commission imposed restrictions on
Friday's parade, attempting to keep Orangemen far from Catholics. The
commission has tried since 1997 with little success to arrange
compromises between Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters.</TE>
<TE>   But Orangemen generally refuse to talk to commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Protestants said Friday's "Tour of the North" parade was intended
to promote solidarity among the area's shrinking and increasingly
isolated Protestant districts, which are separated from the growing
Catholic community by high fences of brick and steel.</TE>
<TE>   Sinn Fein's senior area representative, Gerry Kelly, said Catholic
residents should not have to be within hearing distance of the
orange-vested marchers, who are accompanied by uniformed flutists and
drummers.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said Catholic residents of the New Lodge welfare project
along the parade route "have been under attack, frankly, by the same
people who are marching in this parade."</TE>
<TE>   But an Orange spokesman, Nelson McCausland, said Friday's parade
went mostly past closed businesses and offices, not Catholic
residences. He said many Catholics watching the parade had traveled
several miles from the mostly Catholic west side.</TE>
<TE>   "These IRA supporters have come a long way to be offended," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Clinic's Free Services Don't Draw Many Zapatista
Sympathizers</HD>
<DH>Mexico: In Chiapas state, many in the Indian community
avoid the medical center housed in an abandoned army base on land
they believe was stolen from them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL WEISSERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIO EUSEBA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Paths still snake through the jungle, but the tangles of camouflaged
barbed wire, networks of foxholes and treetop gun posts they once led
to are gone.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers who abandoned this army base and training camp just
15 minutes by all-terrain truck from the Zapatista rebel capital also
took the roof-mounted generator, hauled off the portable radio tower
and dismantled the wooden watchtowers.</LD>
<LD>   All the army left were a two-story barracks and some dogs--a trio
of friendly, if scrawny, mutts who greet anyone who wanders into what
was once a key military outpost.</LD>
<TE>   The barracks now house a clinic set up by the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a building that was the army's, a building built for war,
and we made it a place of the people, a place of peace," said Rodolfo
Dominguez, the clinic's director.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in an effort to coax Zapatista rebels to negotiate an
end to their eight-year rebellion, President Vicente Fox closed seven
military bases built to monitor guerrilla strongholds in southernmost
Chiapas state.</TE>
<TE>   Although talks never started, the government had hoped to turn the
abandoned bases into clinics, schools and Indian community centers.
But all but two of the former bases have been torn down completely
and only the barracks here has been put to a new use. The surviving
building at the other base stands empty while the government and
rebel supporters argue over what to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Zapatistas believe the government seized their land to build
these bases," said Amado Avendano, a Zapatista-supported candidate
for Chiapas governor in 1994. "When the soldiers left, the people
didn't want the government telling them how to use that land or the
abandoned military buildings."</TE>
<TE>   Here at Rio Euseba, a base built along a brook outside the
unofficial Zapatista capital of La Realidad, every day sees a few
dozen people hike as much as two hours from 20 nearby Indian
communities to visit the clinic's resident doctor, Eduardo Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't distinguish between those who are Zapatistas and those
who are not," said Jimenez, 25, who speaks to most of his patients in
Tojolabal, a Mayan language. "We offer free care to anyone in the
area."</TE>
<TE>   But he said many Zapatista sympathizers will come only in an
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "They have worked hard to create autonomous communities that offer
their own medical services," Jimenez said. "Staying away from what
the government offers gives them pride."</TE>
<TE>   The clinic's waiting room is in what used to be the barracks
pantry. Its walls are lined with metal shelves stocked with medicines
brought in by truck from the state capital once every three months.
There is no electricity or hot water, and the clinic doesn't have a
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Marina Rodriguez, who came for a checkup during the seventh
month of her pregnancy, said she wouldn't walk by the base during the
eight years the army was here.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all afraid of this place," she said. "Coming around meant
seeing the soldiers, and that was never good."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, 20, is a Mayan who has lived all but a year of her life
without having a doctor within 20 miles of her home. But although she
allows Jimenez to monitor the progress of her pregnancy, she doesn't
trust modern medicine enough for the delivery of her second child.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customs rely on the midwife," she said. "Our ancestors had
their children in their homes. That is how I will bring my babies
into the world."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Aguilar Lopez, a 35-year-old corn farmer who walked more
than an hour to reach the clinic, said soldiers used to harass people
while searching for Zapatista supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "The soldiers were so close that they could stop you as you walked
along the road and search you for weapons," said Aguilar, who brought
his 1-year-old son, Jaime, for treatment of a rash from poison ivy.
"We are a simple people. Chiapas is a simple place. Why did they need
such new, large bases?"</TE>
<TE>   The other base that hasn't been razed is in the nearby Zapatista
community of Guadalupe Tepeyac. It is down a road of boulders and
dried mud, where cars and trucks have to yield to teams of horses and
cavernous holes can snap even the heaviest axles.</TE>
<TE>   Zapatista guerrillas seized the area after their Jan. 1, 1994,
rebellion and controlled it until the army recaptured it the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   The entire civilian population of Guadalupe Tepeyac fled into the
jungle and lived in exile for more than six years, returning only
when the soldiers left.</TE>
<TE>   They have blocked government efforts to turn the base's
whitewashed barracks into a community center.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who runs a dirt-floored cafeteria said Zapatista
supporters would rather tear down the base and plant corn there.</TE>
<TE>   "We no longer need the Mexican government for anything," said the
graying woman who would give only her first name, Sara, and her age,
41. "For us, the government means death, not positive things like
hospitals and good health."</TE>

<HD>In Peru, the Saint Who Isn't Inspires a Cult</HD>
<DH>Religion: Roman Catholicism and vibrant pop culture
converge to turn a humble Andean migrant into an idol for the
nation's poor and outcast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG MAURO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALLAO, Peru</DL>
<LD>Hundreds jam the sweltering courtyard outside Sarita Colonia's
graveyard shrine to thank her for the miracles she has granted them.</LD>
<LD>   Cliques of drag queens strut through the crowd, clutching rose
bouquets. Elderly women serve bean stew to anyone who is hungry.
Fidgeting children wait in line with their parents to be rubbed with
sacred flower petals.</LD>
<LD>   It is a typical party for Sarita Colonia, a humble Andean migrant
whose brief life has inspired the faith--and fantasies--of a curious
flock of Peruvians, from prisoners and prostitutes to ordinary
grandparents and schoolchildren.</LD>
<TE>   Ofelia Fuentes can barely contain her glee as she bobs among the
crowd at Colonia's tomb.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at all these people," says the 59-year-old fish vendor.
"There isn't one person Sarita hasn't done a miracle for. Isn't that
right?" she shouts to a half dozen listeners. All nod eagerly.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes' eyes grow wide as she tells how her grandson, Roy, was
stillborn 14 years ago but miraculously came back to life after she
rushed to pray at Colonia's shrine.</TE>
<TE>   A faded reproduction of the only existing photograph of Colonia--a
1928 family snapshot--peers from Fuentes' T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years after that photo was taken, Colonia died of malaria
at age 26 and was buried anonymously in a mass grave in this port
city next to Lima.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Peru's fervent Roman Catholicism and its vibrant pop
culture have converged to turn the young woman who had dreamed of
becoming a nun into a saint-like figure for Peru's poor and outcast.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Sarita Colonia is everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Her likeness dangles from the mirrors of Lima's buses and taxis.
Rock singers and pop crooners proclaim her beneficence. Novels and
oil paintings, T-shirts and Web sites, even tattoos and a recent
television miniseries have all exalted Colonia.</TE>
<TE>   It's a devotion pursued without the blessings of the Callao
archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   Colonia has not been canonized, a process that can take centuries.
In the meantime, the church urges her followers not to "worship
Sarita until it is permitted, and much less carry out acts that have
the appearance of witchcraft."</TE>
<TE>   That warning came in a 1980 communique signed by then-Archbishop
Ricardo Durand. The current archbishop's office refused an interview
about Colonia, instead handing out a copy of Durand's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Something like witchcraft hangs in the air at the mecca of
Colonia's following: a cramped, concrete-block shrine run by her
siblings in a Callao cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   There, Sarita devotees leave a few cents to rub themselves with
murky water from flower vases on a black slab altar. Others take away
the water in plastic bottles to keep as a sacred ointment for cuts
and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Several thousand plastic plaques blanket the walls of the muggy
shrine thanking Sarita for miracles. Some devotees tuck photos or
letters into nooks or hang plastic rosaries on a ceramic bust of
Colonia. Others crouch in the corner to light candles--depending on
the color, they are believed to bring good health, luck, work or even
revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Perched on a stool selling candles and other Sarita kitsch, Ester
Colonia, 85, recounts the story of her sister--"a very sweet, very
human girl."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, the family moved from the Andean Mountains to Callao
in search of a better life. As it has been for many of the millions
of poor rural migrants since then, the search was filled with
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, Sarita had to abandon her dreams of becoming a nun when her
mother died. The eldest child, she toiled at odd jobs such as
cleaning houses or selling fish to support the family.</TE>
<TE>   Through the hardship, her siblings say, Sarita maintained a devout
piety, giving her last pennies and clothes off her back to street
beggars. She also became known for praying to God on behalf of anyone
who asked.</TE>
<TE>   "After she died, all those people came to her tomb and began
praying to her. From there, it became a chain reaction," Ester said.</TE>
<TE>   According to popular folklore, for years after her death Colonia's
devotees came mostly from Callao's port-city underworld--sailors,
dockworkers, thieves and prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   The cult persevered in relative obscurity until the 1970s, says
Alejandro Ortiz, an anthropologist at Lima's Catholic University.</TE>
<TE>   That was when Peruvians from impoverished rural areas began
flocking to Lima in search of work. Most found themselves in tough
times, jobless, desperate and packed into shantytowns that sprang up
around the capital.</TE>
<TE>   During those years, Ortiz says, soccer stars and other celebrities
began openly discussing their devotion to Colonia--a woman who
decades before had suffered the same fate as the disenfranchised
migrants.</TE>
<TE>   A pop hero was born.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Peruvians of all ages and backgrounds revere Colonia.</TE>
<TE>   But her following is still popularly associated with the
marginalized and outcast, people like Gabriela Ventura, a 30-year-old
drag queen.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura--out of drag--has come to the shrine to leave Colonia
flowers. He credits her with saving his life when an anti-gay gang
chased and shot at him, their bullets "miraculously" whizzing by his
side.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in God, a very great God," Ventura says. "But I also
believe in my Sarita."</TE>

<HD>A Tropical Home for the Homeless</HD>
<DH>Society: The number of street people in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, has risen from 1,000 to 6,000 in two years. Social services are
cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATY DAIGLE</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>They sprawl beside the jewelry shops and posh boutiques along San
Juan's cobblestoned streets, ragged and dirty men and women with
hands outstretched, begging for money and food.</LD>
<LD>   In just two years, the homeless population of San Juan has risen
from about 1,000 to more than 6,000.</LD>
<LD>   More than three-quarters come from the U.S. mainland or elsewhere
in this American Caribbean territory, seeking work or help from
homeless programs. They come--and stay--for a reason.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got a pretty good life, for a bum," says Joseph Norwood, 52,
who sleeps under the stars in the balmy climate and earns up to $50 a
day weaving palm fronds into the forms of grasshoppers and roses for
passing tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Norwood came from San Diego to escape police warrants for petty
crimes. He first tried to live on other islands in the Caribbean, but
found them too expensive or too poor.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan gave him a welfare net that offered treatment when he
developed arthritis in his spine several years ago. City programs
helped him kick his drinking habit. Tourists provide his bread and
butter.</TE>
<TE>   Such people have always come because "the quality of life for the
homeless is better," says Orlando Gotay, an official at the mayor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan, which boasts a restored colonial city, Spanish forts and
designer outlet shops, is the only Puerto Rican city with thousands
of tourists and outreach programs offering meals, beds, drug
rehabilitation and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a major drug-trafficking port. The U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration estimates that 30% of South American heroin and
cocaine bound for the mainland ends up staying in Puerto Rico, with a
lot going to the street people.</TE>
<TE>   "I've slept in toilets, been in and out of the hospital ....
Still, I kept up with the crack and the speedballs," says Virginia
Fernandes Rios, 52, who came here 10 years ago with her family from
New York City. Her marriage later collapsed and her children cut off
contact and moved away.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandes Rios is sober now, after the city sponsored her
rehabilitation. But she is still on the streets. "My dream is to have
my own home again," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The city program for the homeless has a budget of $5 million,
which is up 300% from last year but is barely enough to deal with the
problem, says its director, Maria Luisa Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bandage over a wound that just gets bigger," Rivera says.
"The more work we do, the more homelessness we find."</TE>
<TE>   The program provides overnight shelter for 152 people. It also
pays for about 1,950 people in drug rehabilitation and more than 800
in psychological counseling.</TE>
<TE>   There also are dozens of private groups and church refuges, but
many people live on the streets. Next to the tourists off the cruise
ships, they look shipwrecked--wild-eyed and loose-jointed.</TE>
<TE>   Many shop owners worry that the upsurge in the numbers of homeless
is threatening an already fragile souvenir trade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real nuisance. They steal from the shop and scare away the
customers. The drug addicts, the open sores and the dirt--you know,
tourists are uncomfortable when they see it," says Guillermo
Rodriguez, owner of an art gallery, La Galeria de la Calle Cristo.</TE>
<TE>   Not all in the tourism business are as concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an eyesore. But many people don't find the shelters an
acceptable alternative," says Erin Benitez, executive vice president
of the Puerto Rico Hotel and Tourism Assn. "Fortunately, we don't
have the hassle factor of people being pushy."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Rivera, 93, holds her leathery hand open in her lap, in
passive supplication. Partially blind and lame, she says she has
lived on the streets for 15 years. She has no family and has fallen
through the social safety net.</TE>
<TE>   "It is OK here," she says, smiling as she waits for a donation.
"It's warm, and people take care of me."</TE>

<HD>A Dog's Life for Thai Squad</HD>
<DH>Asia: Bangkok's 56 police canines endure poor living
conditions but manage to shine in anti-drug and other dangerous
operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>UAMDAO NOIKORN</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>It's a dog's life at the K-9 squad of the Bangkok police.</LD>
<LD>   After a day's work, the 56 police dogs come back home to a badly
ventilated compound where visitors are assaulted by an unbearable
stench. During the rainy season the compound is ankle deep in water.
In summer, the humid air hangs so thick that breathing is an ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the life of Thailand's truly unsung heroes," said police
Lance Cpl. Charoenwai Ornsri, one of the handlers.</LD>
<TE>   She said conditions at the compound don't appear to have changed
in the squad's 47-year existence. The only improvement over the last
decade has been the replacement of a worn-out wire mesh door, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in many Western countries, the canine squad in Thailand's
capital is considered by the government as an unaffordable luxury for
the underfunded police force. The Police Canine Subdivision does not
even have its own budget--its expenses are listed under the
miscellaneous section of the police budget.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the dog squad gets $100,000 a year, or less than 2% of
the Metropolitan Police Bureau's budget of $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the 12 Labradors and 44 German shepherds manage to shine in
operations that include drug searches, riot control, bomb detection
and criminal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Most of their work is in the fight against drugs, a growing
problem that the government has declared public enemy No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Amphetamines and heroin produced by drug gangs in neighboring
Myanmar's border areas are being smuggled into Thailand in increasing
amounts, both for local consumption and for shipment to the West and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   According to government statistics, more than 80 million
amphetamine pills were seized in nearly 8,000 arrests in 2000,
compared with 9 million confiscated during 817 arrests four years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bravo, a 9-year-old black Labrador, was voted Bangkok's
best canine officer after he located 120,000 amphetamine pills hidden
behind a thick wall of marble in a suspect's house.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Bravo has helped police seize more than a million tablets
and 44 pounds of heroin during his eight-year career. He will be
retired this year.</TE>
<TE>   The handlers say it's stressful on the dogs to handle more than
two or three assignments a day, but an increasing workload in and
outside Bangkok has them working twice that many stints.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs sometimes spend several hours traveling in pickup trucks
from one place to another. Their only comfort are bottles of water
and damp cloths on their bodies to beat the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Nataya Nakornchai, head of the Police Canine Subdivision,
estimates that each police checkpoint on drug-trafficking routes
needs four or five dogs to make a dent in the smugglers' ring.</TE>
<TE>   When Nataya took charge two years ago, there were only 12 dogs in
the squad. She said she had to beg her bosses to get 30 more dogs.
Four others were bred at the compound, and 10 more were donated. "We
know it's not a good practice to accept puppies of unknown pedigree
from the general public, but we have no choice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The department lacks the money to buy training materials. Nataya
said the clothes, backpacks, furniture and general household objects
in which drugs are hidden for the dogs to detect were donated by the
handlers and other police officers.</TE>
<TE>   For true dog lovers, it is "depressing and heartbreaking" when
they see the animals' situation, said Lance Cpl. Samart Wasukree,
another dog handler.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to love animals and be ultra patient. The pay is
low. The conditions are harsh. But you get to work with your best
friend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Samart said he takes comfort in knowing that the dogs will live a
better life after retirement, when they are auctioned off to
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people are willing to pay as much as 10,000 baht [nearly
$230] in the auction even if the dogs are old and not that cute.
Isn't that a happy ending?"</TE>

<HD>Old-Growth Forest Sparks Dispute After Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Forest Service says salvage logging will reduce
fire risks. But environmentalists contend that some trees are still
alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SONNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>EMIGRANT GAP, Calif.</DL>
<LD>EMIGRANT GAP, Calif. -- Part of the Tahoe National Forest that burned
in a 2,400-acre wildfire last summer looks just the way one might
imagine.</LD>
<LD>   Charred limbs and twigs rise from the scorched, black earth among
pockets of standing skeletons of trees with brown needles.</LD>
<LD>   Downed, dead logs of charcoal are scattered across the top of the
Sierra a mile south of Interstate 80.</LD>
<TE>   The scene matches the description of the devastation in a Forest
Service analysis done for a pending salvage logging project.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gap fire was an unusually complete burn," the Forest
Service's environmental assessment says. "Very little of the
aboveground vegetation in this area appears to have survived."</TE>
<TE>   But walk a few hundred yards down the Old Stage Road in the
900-acre logging area along the North Fork of the American River,
past the woodpeckers and a bear's 8-inch-long footprints, and you'll
find something you wouldn't expect:</TE>
<TE>   Big, green trees. Lots of them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service is claiming the forest is completely dead,"
said Chad Hanson, head of the John Muir Project that is fighting the
logging with the Earth Island Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "But clearly that's not the case for at least half of the project
area. In most areas the big trees have only been mildly scorched and
most of those are going to live," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He points to dozens of large green stands of incense cedars, red
firs, white firs, sugar pines and ponderosa pines, some hundreds of
years old and more than 100 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire did come through here but it did not destroy the forest.
This forest is very clearly alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service scientists say many trees that look alive are
actually dead, soon will turn brown and eventually fall to the forest
floor to serve as fuel for another, hotter fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe Chad has the background he needs in natural
resources to tell the difference," said Bob Cary, Forest Service team
leader for the Gap fire salvage project. "I'm not sure he knows
exactly what he is looking at."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is the latest between Forest Service officials and
environmental groups challenging government plans to log forests in
the name of reducing fire risks.</TE>
<TE>   The agency and its backers say thinning and salvage operations are
essential to reduce dead and dying timber in national forests
throughout the West.</TE>
<TE>   "There just aren't too many places in the timbered areas of
California that won't burn any more," said Tim Feller of Sierra
Pacific Industries, one of the largest landowners in the state. "With
the combination of 100 years of fire suppression and forest fuel
buildup, it's a no-brainer any more."</TE>
<TE>   The Gap fire burned for nearly two weeks last August, closing the
interstate between Sacramento and Reno, Nev. The Forest Service
estimates the fire killed more than 350,000 trees larger than 2
inches thick, about 90% of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Eubanks, Forest Service supervisor of the Tahoe National
Forest, said some dead wood is good for soil nutrients and wildlife
habitat, but "the massive amount represented by all the dead trees
presents a problem because, as grasses and brush sprout and grow amid
the dead logs, severe fire hazard develops."</TE>
<TE>   Cary calculates there are enough standing dead trees for one to
fall every seven hours for the next 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salvage logging has been hotly debated since President Clinton
drew the ire of environmentalists by signing a pro-logging measure
pushed by Northwest Congress members in 1994--a move Vice President
Al Gore later called the biggest mistake of Clinton's first term.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, President Bush said in a statement to a Wildland Fire
Conference in Idaho that he wants to promote "sound forest management
to restore forest health....</TE>
<TE>   "In many areas, this will require active forest management efforts
to thin our forests of excessive natural fuels and restore native
vegetation to our forests and rangelands."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many industry leaders criticize the Forest Service for not
moving quickly enough.</TE>
<TE>   In an article headlined "Federal Fiddling While California Burns,"
California Forest Products Commission Chairman Donn Zea complained
that federal forests grow billions of unharvested board feet each
year, creating concentrated fuel for wildfires. Average acres burned
in the Sierra jumped from about 300,000 in the mid-1980s to more than
750,000 by the end of the 1990s, Zea said.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't happening because people are throwing more matches out
their car windows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much of the dispute hinges on guidelines used to predict whether a
tree is dead or will die.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service makes a decision primarily by estimating "crown
scorch"--the percentage of the tree's foliage that has been burned.
Agency workers also sometimes hack into the bark to see if the tree's
inner skin, the cambium, has been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the Forest Service considers a ponderosa pine to be
dead if it has at least 55% crown scorch.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, who has been active in forest protection for 12 years, and
Fazio subscribe to new research that suggests many ponderosa pines
survive with as much as 95% crown scorch.</TE>
<TE>   Cary said that defies common sense.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a tree that is in your front yard and you cut 95% of
the foliage off it, is it going to live? It might, but probably not,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are finding over and over again, particularly with
ponderosa pine, is the buds will burst with new foliage the following
spring, and some of those will live and continue to grow. But many of
them I've seen, the new foliage bursts out and it wilts and dies,"
Cary said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Forest Service said only dead trees in the Gap
fire will be removed--meaning those with no visible green foliage.</TE>
<TE>   The original environmental assessment issued in April estimated
95% of the Gap project area was dead. A flyover May 12 revised the
estimate to about 87%, Cary said.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson estimates about half of the forest is dead or dying but the
rest will recover. He doesn't trust the agency to take only dead
trees, especially because the area has been closed to the public and
no one may observe the logging operation expected to begin this fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back on the site, the Old Stage Road wanders through a classic
cathedral grove of old-growth trees, with ponderosa pines towering
100 feet in the air. One estimated to be more than 300 years old is
more than 4 feet in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson estimates its crown scorch at 5%. Black scorch marks reach
about 5 feet up the bark.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the project area, bordering clear-cut private
lands, is a large collection of old-growth, which overlaps into an
area he says is suitable habitat for the California spotted owl.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping from the hot midday sun on the dusty road into the damp
shade of the forest, the temperature drops noticeably.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel the difference immediately," Hanson said as
mosquitoes began to swarm.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a blind person can tell," Fazio said. "It doesn't take a ...
forester to tell you you're in an old-growth forest."</TE>

<HD>Freed by DNA, Ky. Man Eyes Fresh Start</HD>
<DH>Crime: William Gregory, jailed seven years for rapes, was
cleared by evidence. Money woes and starting over at 54 haven't
robbed him of finding happiness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON L. CRENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The laughter that bubbles from William Gregory is unexpected, the
last thing anticipated from a man talking about life after prison.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory served seven years of a 70-year sentence before DNA
evidence ruled him out as the rapist in two Kentucky attacks. Now
middle-age, he is one of the oldest men starting over after being
wrongfully imprisoned and freed by science.</LD>
<LD>   "Financially, it destroyed my life," Gregory says. "At 54 years
old, approaching 60, you don't have anything to fall back on.
Companies are skeptical about hiring someone who is 54 years old."</LD>
<TE>   And emotionally, anxiety overwhelms him if the bedroom door at his
home in Louisville isn't locked at night.</TE>
<TE>   But then ask Gregory about his 13-year-old son, who lives with
Gregory's ex-wife in Ohio, or about his fiancee, Vicki Kidwell, and
Gregory just can't contain his laughter.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't seen his son since he was a baby, but he pays child
support and fixed up a room for the boy in the new house that church
friends helped pay for.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I speak of him, I just laugh. He's a beautiful boy,"
Gregory said.</TE>
<TE>   He and Kidwell are also rearing her two teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're striving for [is] just to be happy," Kidwell says. "I
just want to make it as easy on him as I can, and so do the kids."</TE>
<TE>   They are obviously grateful for one another despite the struggles
of stepparenting and rebuilding Gregory's credit history. A car loan
recently commanded 26% interest, and their mortgage runs $1,000 a
month. Those are steep payments on her bank teller's salary and the
$7 an hour Gregory earns clerking at Walgreens.</TE>
<TE>   He has received no compensation from the state, but he's suing
Louisville for $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwell and Gregory met when she was just 19 and were briefly
engaged. That was 15 years ago. They lost track of one another, and
Gregory went to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwell found him again after local news reports of his release.</TE>
<TE>   "I broke down and cried. I was like, in disbelief, because William
was never the kind of man to physically hurt a woman," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The two have been together again since Kidwell found the courage
to pick up the phone and call.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, free since 2000, still sees a psychologist to help him
quell prison demons. And he has told his bosses he can't stay at
Walgreens unless they pay him more or put him into management
training. Still, he works hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still showing them that I am of that caliber," he said. "I'm
letting them see what they are going to lose if they don't do

<HD>Behind in the Count, Town Gets a Big Hit</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The down-and-out community in southern Illinois
is rallying around Little League, its own field of dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SKILES LUKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOUNDS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>MOUNDS, Ill. -- Little League dad Gene Kennedy bursts into the
hardware store. The town's first game is about to start at the new
ballpark, and the umpires have nothing to clean home plate with.</LD>
<LD>   Store owner Craig Rose hands him a paintbrush, no charge.</LD>
<LD>   People are chipping in any way they can for the new league and
lighted diamond, which some expect will bring hope and summertime fun
to a town where both are scarce.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to give us a nice boost," said Mike Khourie, who owns
an auction house next to the store. "It'll help the economy, the kids
and the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   The place could use some help. Mounds, in deep southern Illinois,
was ranked by census figures among the poorest towns in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs on the nearby Ohio and Mississippi rivers, on the railroad
and in the apple and peach orchards have dried up over the last
half-century, sending many off to work elsewhere and leaving those
behind with few options.</TE>
<TE>   "Our enemies here are apathy, hopelessness and defeatism," said
Dan Prigge, who heads an economic development group in Pulaski
County.</TE>
<TE>   The county's population has dropped by about half in the last 60
years, to 9,500.</TE>
<TE>   The median income in Mounds, the county's biggest town with 1,100
people, hovers around the federal poverty line of $17,000 a year for
a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   Many families either didn't have the time or the money to make the
10-mile trip to Olmsted, where the closest Little League had been
since the old school diamond closed in Mounds more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, an avid baseball fan, wanted to bring the sport back to
his hometown. When he and his friends hatched a plan last year to
start the league, they thought they could get enough $600
sponsorships for one or two teams.</TE>
<TE>   To their surprise, organizers found enough sponsors for 13 teams
among the churches, businesses and other groups they canvassed.
They'd found enough to sign up more than 200 boys and girls ages 3 to
18. Most are local; the rest are from Villa Ridge, Mound City and
other nearby villages.</TE>
<TE>   "People were starved for something positive," said Kennedy, an
insurance salesman who also coaches his son Brent's team.</TE>
<TE>   They also got help from the Southernmost Illinois Delta
Empowerment Zone, which offers grants and loans from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to boost the regional economy and improve
the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has distributed about $4 million for dozens of projects
ranging from cleaning up vacant lots to converting an old school into
a community center, said director Donna Raynalds.</TE>
<TE>   It also paid the $55,000 bill for the new ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to build communities, and when people start to see things
change, success breeds success," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The city donated use of the land, which was previously an empty
lot, and diverted its own empowerment-zone grant earmarked for
sidewalks to the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Sidewalks can wait," said Mayor Grace Richards, a retired
beautician. "But the kids need something to do this summer."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, about the only places for children to play in Mounds
were a run-down basketball court and a small playground.</TE>
<TE>   There are no summer day camps. The closest public swimming pool is
30 miles away, and many kids are reluctant to swim in the rivers. Too
many snakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Last summer I went fishing and hunting and took my pellet gun and
busted out windows, mostly of abandoned cars, anything I could find,"
11-year-old Reuben Bellamy admitted.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Reuben gets up early to play catch and prepare for his
team's daily 1 p.m. practice.</TE>
<TE>   The bleachers quickly filled for the home opener at the nearly
completed field, which has a cinderblock concession stand, dugouts,
fenced backstop and a freshly painted infield. The city's white water
tower stands over center field, the town's name emblazoned on it.</TE>
<TE>   Before the first player took the batter's box, more than 100
people crowded behind the backstop, most on lawn chairs they had
brought from home. They let out a collective "Ah!" when the lights
came on at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere on the home team's side was the Isom family, who had
come to watch 7-year-old Wyatt Isom play third base in his first
Little League game.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Mounds ballpark opened, Shavona and Bill Isom, who each
work two jobs, had to tell Wyatt and his 10-year-old brother, Steven,
that they couldn't play baseball because neither parent could get
them to practice and games that were far away.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to say no because there was just nothing for them to
do here," said Shavona Isom, as she sat on her folding chair.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Isom was standing near third base, where Wyatt was shifting
his weight from his right foot to his left, looking bored. His team
was losing.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Isom didn't care. He was taking pictures.</TE>

<HD>Americans Are Dinosaurs When It Comes to Science, Survey
Finds</HD>
<DH>Education: Many think man and T.Rex coexisted. To more than
half, DNA and molecules are mysteries. Comedians love the material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Can a nation debate the merits of cloning when fewer than half its
adults can give a decent definition of DNA?</LD>
<LD>   Can it render good judgment on genetically engineered food when
only a quarter can define a molecule?</LD>
<LD>   And can Americans assess competing medical claims when only a
third show a good understanding of the scientific process?</LD>
<TE>   Experts see cause for concern in the latest report card on
American scientific understanding. But they aren't surprised.</TE>
<TE>   Like many people, Shirley M. Malcom, head of education for the
American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, has seen "Tonight"
show host Jay Leno's quizzes of people on the street.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leno: "Where would you find chlorophyll?"</TE>
<TE>   Dante from Michigan: "Probably in your toilet."</TE>
<TE>   (Correct answer: In plants.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leno broke the news about the new study to his audience last
month:</TE>
<TE>   "Here's something shocking. According to a study by the National
Science Foundation, 70% of Americans do not understand science.
Here's the sad part: 30% don't even know what 70% means."</TE>
<TE>   That second statistic is only a joke. But the foundation did
report that a survey of American adults turned up low numbers like
these:</TE>
<TE>   * 45% could define "DNA," the substance carrying the inherited
genetic code.</TE>
<TE>   * 22% could define "molecule," the basic unit of a chemical
compound.</TE>
<TE>   * 48% knew electrons are smaller than atoms.</TE>
<TE>   * 48% knew it's not true that the earliest humans lived at the
same time as dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   Dinosaurs and humans missed each other by some 60 million years.
But "we're interviewing people on the phone who grew up watching
'Flintstones,' " said Melissa Pollak, senior analyst at the
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Only about one-third showed a good understanding of the scientific
process, including ideas about probability and how to do an
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   Americans did better on some other questions. Ninety-four percent
knew cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, for example, and about
three-quarters knew that some radioactivity is naturally produced,
that continents are moving and that light travels faster than sound.</TE>
<TE>   The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   In its current form, the survey has been given every two years
since 1979 and overall the results haven't changed much, Pollak said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's discouraging," she said. "We'd hope people would know more
than they seem to know about some basic science facts and concepts."</TE>
<TE>   If it's any consolation, the United States did slightly better
than 14 other industrialized countries in the early 1990s, ranking
about equal to Denmark and the Netherlands, Pollak said. Her quick
look at new survey data suggests this country is still somewhat
ahead, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But some see reason for hope in survey results over the years. Jon
Miller of Northwestern University, who directed the survey from 1979
to '99, has his own index of scientific literacy. It includes an
understanding of scientific process plus vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   By that gauge, "the trend in the last decade has been very
encouraging," he said, with science literacy growing from 10% in 1988
to 17% in 1999. He hasn't calculated the number for the new survey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leno: "What keeps the Earth orbiting around the sun?"</TE>
<TE>   Sarah from Cleveland: "The gravitational pull ... of the moon."</TE>
<TE>   (Correct answer: The gravitational pull of the sun.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What bothers Pollak the most is the finding that only about a
third of adults showed a good understanding of the scientific
process.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where science can benefit people in their daily lives,"
Pollak said. People get bombarded with claims by psychics and medical
quacks, she said, and if they don't understand about critical
thinking and scientific evidence, they can waste time and money.</TE>
<TE>   That understanding also helps citizens confront scientific
political issues where the media are often content to present both
sides of an argument, no matter which side has better evidence, said
Malcom of the AAAS.</TE>
<TE>   There's another related concern. How will the United States
provide a sufficient supply of qualified workers for careers in
science and technology? Nowadays, the nation is leaning heavily on
foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not function in our government laboratories, in our
academic laboratories and in our industrial laboratories without
these workers," says William Haseltine, chief executive officer of
Human Genome Sciences Inc. "I would guess we would drop in
productivity by about 50% or more.... We simply don't train enough
[American] people."</TE>
<TE>   The science foundation reports that as of 1999, about a quarter of
all U.S. workers holding a doctorate in science or engineering were
foreign-born.</TE>
<TE>   For computer science and engineering doctorates, about 45% were
foreign-born, and for biological sciences, 27%.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers are queasy about the future supply of foreign
expertise.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't depend on it," Haseltine says. "As economic conditions
improve abroad, it's less likely these foreign workers will come to
the United States.... We've already seen some reverse brain drain,
back to China, back to Europe, back to Germany in particular," by
people who've gotten years of training in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious response, Haseltine and others say, is to produce more
Americans with science and engineering expertise.</TE>
<TE>   So, if it's up to this country, how does it increase Americans'
understanding of science? The real engine, experts say, is the
schoolroom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leno: "Who invented pasteurization?"</TE>
<TE>   Kerry from Denver: "Um, some agriculture person ... [from]
Nebraska."</TE>
<TE>   (Correct answer: French scientist Louis Pasteur.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Ridenour, science department leader at Ithaca High School in
Ithaca, N.Y., tells the story of two kindergarten teachers she
visited. Each presented the class with a large water pool that
contained a toy boat.</TE>
<TE>   One teacher asked, "What do you think would make this boat move?"
Students suggested they could blow on it, squirt water on it or
simply push it. Then the teacher said, "Show me."</TE>
<TE>   When the other teacher presented the same basic setup to her
class, she simply said, "Here are some straws. Blow on the boat and
see if it moves."</TE>
<TE>   The first approach, which invited children to think rather than
just follow instructions, teaches critical thinking through the
process of inquiry, Ridenour said. That's one way she and others
recommend to help kids learn more about science.</TE>
<TE>   It has to start early. Around fourth or fifth grade, "you go into
the valley of the shadow," where pupils turn off to science and math
unless they've experienced good classroom material, chances to
explore the topic and "teachers who love the subject," said Judith
Ramaley, with the science foundation's education and human resources
section.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation plans to spend about $1 billion over the next five
years for its third generation of efforts over the last decade to
improve science and math teaching, Ramaley said.</TE>
<TE>   Among its priorities is better training in those subjects for
teachers. "It's very clear that teachers matter, and their knowledge
of subject matter content is critical," Ramaley said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, many who teach math or science don't have backgrounds
in those subjects, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The science foundation reported in 2000 that 31% of math teachers
and 20% of science teachers in grades 7-12 lack a major or minor in
their subjects.</TE>
<TE>   But better training before teaching doesn't solve another problem.
Within five years of starting a career, nearly half of urban math and
science teachers leave the classroom, said Harold Pratt, immediate
past president of the National Science Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They'd stick around more if they had inducements such as more
mentoring, better teaching assignments and chances to take classes
and seminars, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramaley emphasized that teachers also need to be paid more and
"treated as professionals" with more say in what and how they teach.</TE>
<TE>   Malcom and others say people certainly are capable of learning
about science.</TE>
<TE>   Her office develops science materials for people with poor general
literacy. "Our experience has been if you help them understand the
significance of the topic and provide the information at a level they
can engage with it, that they are very engaged," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, at Northwestern, says that people who get a good
foundation in the classroom are poised to learn even more through the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   And the same technology should let a growing class of
scientifically literate citizens take more control of science-related
government debates by bombarding legislators with e-mail, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If science literacy rises to 25% of adults in the next decade,
Miller said, that means about 50 million people even by today's
population.</TE>
<TE>   And that, he says, will catch the attention of Capitol Hill.</TE>

<HD>A War Rages Over Civil War Relics</HD>
<DH>Battlefields: 'When someone takes that artifact out of the
ground they're taking part of the story that item has to tell,' a
historian says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DISHNEAU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOONSBORO, Md.</DL>
<LD>The looters left signs only trained eyes could see: scars in the
earth where shovels were used to dig up relics of Civil War battles.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators found 73 refilled holes in January on weed-covered
Wise's Field, a remote piece of western Maryland real estate where
Union and Confederate soldiers clashed during the Battle of South
Mountain on Sept. 14, 1862.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities don't know what was taken from the federally owned
land along the Appalachian Trail. Probably bullets, maybe some brass
buttons or a belt buckle. Such items are prized by collectors willing
to pay anywhere from a few dollars for common objects to thousands
for artifacts that can be traced to specific battles, regiments or
soldiers. "When someone takes that artifact out of the ground,
they're taking more than that item; they're taking part of the story
that item has to tell," said Al Preston, a state historical
interpreter who has studied the battle.</LD>
<TE>   Penalties of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for
removing archeological resources from federal lands haven't stopped
determined diggers like those who violated Wise's Field. Despite
scores of prosecutions reported annually by the National Park
Service, violations have increased over the last decade at Civil War
sites in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The nearby 3,200-acre Antietam National Battlefield, site of the
war's bloodiest one-day battle, has two open cases of looting,
including one dating to the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest cases was resolved in 1997 when two men were
sentenced to several months in prison. They were ordered to pay about
$25,000 in restitution for excavating more than 1,000 artifacts from
the Petersburg National Battlefield Park in Virginia. Among the
historical treasures: bullets, belt buckles, canteens and harmonicas.</TE>
<TE>   More often, people are caught in the act of searching with
electronic metal detectors. Between Antietam and the Monocacy
National Battlefield, a smaller Maryland site managed by the Antietam
staff, rangers arrest about one such prospector every other month,
chief ranger Ed Wenschhof said. The penalty for possessing a metal
detector in the parks is $50.</TE>
<TE>   There are spots, though, that may be searched legally for Civil
War artifacts--private lands adjoining publicly owned battle sites.
The boundaries are sometimes fuzzy, even on detailed maps, which
frustrates relic hunters with permission from private landowners,
according to John Owens, a member of the local South Mountain Relic &amp;
Coin Club.</TE>
<TE>   Wise's Field is apparently one such area, Owens said. "I've talked
to some people who have gone up there and they're not exactly clear
on where the national park boundaries are or whose boundaries are
what."</TE>
<TE>   He said the club is inviting park rangers to its meetings later
this year to discuss the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Relic hunter Donald Komjian said he makes sure of the boundaries
before he searches for artifacts on private land, with permission. A
postal employee from Huntersville, N.C., Komjian spent a recent sunny
afternoon walking the spacious backyard of Philip and Lilli Wilson's
43-acre farm on the Antietam battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   He found two .58-caliber Union bullets, a common variety known as
three-ringers that fetch $110 per 100 on the Web site www.cwrelics
.com. Komjian keeps what he finds for his collection of about 1,000
items gathered during 15 years of what he calls "sniffing" for
relics.</TE>
<TE>   Komjian won't be returning to the Wilsons' land, though. This is
their second year of allowing bullet-hunting and Lilli Wilson said it
will be the last. Word spread quickly after she and her husband gave
a few polite prospectors permission, and soon the hobbyists were
showing up on her doorstep or making insistent, sometimes
belligerent, phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it two ways," she said. "By hunting the relics for
themselves or for museums, people are able to learn about the
soldiers. The other way I look at it is that it's history and it
really should be left alone. It's sacred ground, and to us living
here, it's just home."</TE>

<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Like many boys growing up here, Dougie Allen loved the Kentucky
Wildcats.</LD>
<LD>   He fantasized about being an athlete and wearing the University of
Kentucky blue and white.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, he was able to do just that, thanks to an assist
from a Kentucky basketball icon.</LD>
<TE>   Allen was one of six recipients of the first Kentucky Excel
Incentive Scholarship, a program developed in 1994 with a $500,000
gift from former Wildcat All-American Jamal Mashburn.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved Jamal as a player," said Allen, a former Kentucky
football player who became one of the first two students in the
program to graduate last month. "But as I watched him play on the
court, I never thought he'd be responsible for my college education."</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn, who played basketball at UK from 1991-93 and ranks fifth
on the school's all-time scoring list with 1,843 points, made the
gift shortly after leaving the school early to jump to the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   His professional career has taken him from Dallas to Miami and
finally to Charlotte, N.C. But Mashburn still hasn't forgotten his
humble childhood on the playgrounds of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's all about giving kids a chance," Mashburn said. "When
I was growing up, my mom always told me that without basketball I
probably wouldn't get the chance to go to college because it was too
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many kids out there who need that chance because
they don't have sports to fall back on to get them an athletic
scholarship."</TE>
<TE>   The program selects eighth-grade students enrolled in the Fayette
County public school system. Recipients are chosen based on
demonstrated educational commitment, satisfactory classroom conduct,
recommendations from teachers and counselors, student essays and
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The word "incentive" in the program's title is not just for show.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients earn a year's paid tuition at Kentucky for each year of
high school that they maintain a 2.5 grade point average with strong
behavior and attendance records.</TE>
<TE>   "The program is designed to identify students who are doing well
but may run into challenges as they go through high school," said
Lauretta Byars, Kentucky's associate provost for minority affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about potential. We want to show these kids some
encouragement and get them excited about college while trying to help
them understand the commitment and focus needed to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Cassandra Small entered the program in 1996 when she was in middle
school.</TE>
<TE>   "The scholarship taught me that I could believe in myself," she
said. "I knew if I kept my grades high, the scholarship would help
make my college dreams come true."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who graduated with a degree in nutrition and food science,
said the scholarship allowed him to focus on academics and athletics
in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in middle school, you don't really realize how big a
thing a college scholarship is," said Allen, who caught 86 passes for
963 yards and five touchdowns in four seasons with Kentucky's
football team. "But the further you get in high school, the more you
understand what a blessing it is.</TE>
<TE>   "The scholarship was a sure way for me to go to college. That took
a lot of pressure off of me and let me direct all of my energy toward
my classes and football."</TE>
<TE>   According to Byars, there are 25 students currently in the
program, either at Kentucky or in high school working toward that
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Allen and Taquoya Owens--another nutrition and food science
major--are the first two graduates of the six-member inaugural class
of 1994. Two of the students in the first group did not graduate high
school--one went to military school and the other still is at UK
working toward graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "We know going in, because of the way we select these students,
that some of them may never make it to college," Byars said. "But
that's the way Jamal wanted it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are serious problems and distractions kids contend with
during their high school years. For Jamal to recognize that and want
to go to the trouble to help these kids as a 20-year-old kid himself
... he was just mature beyond his years."</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn said he believes college is a crucial resource in
preparing young people for life as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about books and a degree, or about the crowd and
athletics like it was for me," he said. "It's about living on your
own, paying bills, staying on a budget and making new relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people never get the opportunity to experience that, so I
created this fund to try to help them. I've also done this for some
friends and cousins because college is so important. Everyone
deserves a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Allen may have had that chance, even without Mashburn's help.</TE>
<TE>   Although he continued as a member of the program throughout high
school and college, he never used any of the scholarship money
because of an athletic scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   That money still will be available to Allen, however, if he later
chooses to go to graduate school. He recently signed a free agent
contract with the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL, so any future
educational opportunities are on hold--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's comforting to know that that option is there if I need
it," he said. "The reality is, I may not make it in football. If not,
the program has given me something to fall back on.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll go back to school and then someday open up my own
restaurant in Lexington--a good old barbecue place where everything
is cooked on the grill. Maybe I'll even call it Jamal's."</TE>

<HD>Radcliffe Always Able to Pull Double Duty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ARMOUR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The long, thick fingers of Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe are bent every
which way, battered so thoroughly by his 36 years of catching that
they're impossible to straighten.</LD>
<LD>   Yet they still reveal the strength that also made him a dominant
pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   "I was the only one who could pitch and catch," said Radcliffe,
who turns 100 next month--the oldest living Negro leagues player.</LD>
<TE>   "Damon Runyon said I was the best he'd ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mobile, Ala., on July 7, 1902, Ted Radcliffe can't
remember a time when he didn't play baseball. Satchel Paige was a
boyhood friend, and Radcliffe smiles as he recalls catching the
greatest pitcher ever when they were still teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "He could throw it out of sight," Radcliffe said. "He threw it so
hard, he could throw it through a wall."</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe was pretty good himself. A team in Montgomery tried to
recruit him when he was 15 or 16, but his father refused, saying he
was too young. But at 17, Radcliffe and his brother, Alex, hopped a
freight train to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe didn't waste any time when he got here, finding a pickup
game near old Comiskey Park. He soon caught the eye of the owner of
the Illinois Giants, a semipro team.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If I give you $25, would you pitch for me today?' "
Radcliffe said. "I set the team down 12-0. I haven't looked back
since."</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe had the talent and charisma to be a star in the majors,
said James Riley, director of research for the Negro Leagues Baseball
Museum in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   He was a sharp catcher who called solid games, and he made sure he
knew every hitter's strengths and weaknesses. He was a good pitcher,
too, though he freely admits his pitches weren't all legal.</TE>
<TE>   "His defensive skills as a catcher would have kept him in the
major leagues for 20 years," Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   But it was 1920 when he started playing professional baseball, 27
years before Jackie Robinson would break the color barrier, and
Radcliffe wasn't welcome in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when black Americans couldn't play in the major
leagues, so they started their own, separate leagues," said Riley,
author of six books on the Negro leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the greatest talent in world played there."</TE>
<TE>   And Radcliffe played with almost all of the best. From the time he
signed with the Detroit Stars of the National Negro League in 1928
until he retired in the mid-1950s, he played for more than 40 teams.</TE>
<TE>   He followed the money, leaving whenever someone offered him a
bigger paycheck. Along the way, he played with everyone from Paige to
Josh Gibson to Bobbie Robinson to Oscar Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   "He played whenever, wherever," Riley said. "He has been very
helpful in helping salvage the history of the Negro leagues because
he was around for a long time and knows the stories."</TE>
<TE>   The best story came in 1932, when Paige and Radcliffe were playing
for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, perhaps the greatest Negro league team
ever. They played a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium one day, and
Runyon was there to see it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first game, Satchel Paige pitched a shutout and Ted
caught," Riley said. "Then the second game, Ted took the mound and
pitched a shutout. Runyon wrote in his column that "it was worth the
price of two admissions to see 'Double Duty' Radcliffe play."</TE>
<TE>   The nickname stuck.</TE>
<TE>   "I could pitch and catch all my life," Radcliffe said. "I thank
God he gave me the strength to make a good name for myself."</TE>
<TE>   With a vibrant personality that rivaled his athletic skills,
Radcliffe was one of the Negro leagues' biggest draws. To this day,
nobody calls him "Ted" or "Mr. Radcliffe." It's "Double Duty," or
just plain "Duty." He was a six-time All-Star, three times each as a
pitcher and catcher. In the 1944 game, he hit the game-winning homer
into Comiskey's upper deck. A year earlier, he won the Negro American
League MVP--at age 41.</TE>
<TE>   Though the majors slowly integrated after Robinson joined the
Dodgers, Radcliffe's chance had passed. He continued playing in the
Negro leagues, and ended his career in Canada. By the time he
retired, he'd played all over the United States, Canada, Mexico and
Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a living testament to what African-American baseball
players endured to play their favorite game," said Raymond Doswell,
curator at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope that people kind of realize the treasures these men
are through the wonderful milestone he's about to cross."</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe lives in a retirement community about a half-mile from
Comiskey Park. His two-bedroom apartment is filled with
memorabilia--bats, gloves, plaques, posters--and his easy chair sits
next to a window overlooking a sandlot.</TE>
<TE>   When the weather is nice, he puts on a suit, laces up his
wingtips, picks out a hat and heads to the ballpark. He has a
standing invitation to White Sox games, with a staff member waiting
to escort him to his seat when great-niece Debra Richards drops him
off.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone greets him by name, stopping to shake his hand and hear
one of his many stories. And if he spies a woman, look out. A month
shy of 100, he's still a flirt.</TE>
<TE>   He'll visit the clubhouse occasionally, and he's grown close to
many of the White Sox players.</TE>
<TE>   Some are fascinated by his stories and the history he represents,
others feel indebted to him and the other players of his era.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, Reggie Jackson told him he was grateful to those guys
because they paved the way for guys like him to come along," Richards
said. "Until you hear people actually say that, it's something you
don't think about."</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe doesn't pay much attention to it. He refuses to dwell on
the injustices blacks suffered before the civil rights movement,
saying everyone's always treated him well.</TE>
<TE>   "God has been good to me," Radcliffe said. "I don't care if he
takes me tomorrow. I'm 100 years old."</TE>

<HD>Henman Has to Deal With Role</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Britain's best hope to win Wimbledon is actually
declared favorite by the British oddsmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRYSTYNA RUDZKI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>For the past five years, Tim Henman has been Britain's best hope to
win Wimbledon. This year, he's gone one step better--he's the
favorite.</LD>
<LD>   British bookmaker William Hill has Henman as the clear 7-2
favorite to win his first Grand Slam title and become the first
British man to lift the Wimbledon trophy since Fred Perry in 1936.</LD>
<LD>   The player who sparks a wave of "Henmania" around the country each
June for the tournament nicknamed "Timbledon" in Britain is seeded
No. 4 for the grass-court major that starts Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and No. 3 Andre Agassi are
listed as second co-favorites at 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   Henman is primed to overturn his heartbreak of last year when he
lost a four-set semifinal against eventual champion Goran
Ivansevic--a rain-delayed match that took three days to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Henman, 27, has often been criticized for failing to fulfill his
potential on grass, the best surface for his traditional serve and
volley style. He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1996 and
1997, the semifinals the following two years and the fourth round in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The furthest Henman has reached in any other Grand Slam event is
the fourth round--the U.S. Open (1996 and 1998) and Australian Open
(2000 and 2001).</TE>
<TE>   "My desire to win Wimbledon can't get any greater," Henman said
after losing to Xavier Malisse in the second round of last month's
French Open. "That's always been the ultimate goal for me."</TE>
<TE>   Former three-time Wimbledon winner John McEnroe has often cited
Henman as a probable champion. So has Boris Becker.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Tim is one of a handful of serious contenders to win
Wimbledon," said Becker, also a former three-time champion.</TE>
<TE>   "Though he hasn't won it yet, he is awfully close, and I think
when his playing days are over he will have won it at least once."</TE>
<TE>   Henman might also have history on his side. The last time a
British player, Virginia Wade, won a Wimbledon singles title was in
1977--during celebrations marking Queen Elizabeth II's 25 years on
the throne. This year's tournament coincides with the queen's 50th
jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   Henman was also the beneficiary of a very favorable draw. He's in
the far easier top half, away from No. 2 Marat Safin, Agassi, No. 5
Yevgeny Kafelnikov and seven-time winner Pete Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   Henman will play qualifiers in the first two rounds and should
have clear sailing to the quarterfinals, where he could face
Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, seeded No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Henman is projected to face his greatest challenge in the
semis--Hewitt. The Australian has a 5-0 record over Henman since
2000, including wins in the last two Queen's Club finals.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Henman is playing down his chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Many are saying it's inevitable," Henman said. "But it was
probably only four months ago they were saying I couldn't play. Now
I'm guaranteed to be champion at Wimbledon!</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can achieve what I have achieved without having
talent and I will always go out on to the court and give 100 percent.
The main question is: 'Will that be good enough?' "</TE>
<TE>   Last April, Henman split with longtime coach and friend David
Felgate after nine years. After playing Wimbledon without a coach, he
hired American Larry Stefanki--who has worked with John McEnroe and
Kafelnikov--and his game has improved.</TE>
<TE>   "The things we started to work on only came to fruition at the
beginning of the year," Henman said at the Queen's tournament. "Larry
has definitely had an impact on my game, which has come a long way in
six months. Though we haven't quite been together for 12 months, I
know I'm a better player going into Wimbledon."</TE>

<HD>Anschutz Pushes On in L.A. Despite Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In yet another weird episode in Southern California's troubled affair
with the National Football League, Anschutz Entertainment Group
recently laid out--and then immediately withdrew--plans for a new
stadium in Los Angeles at which two NFL teams would play.</LD>
<LD>   The company says that any deal is off and that it won't exercise
options on land for a stadium near downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Yet knowledgeable business-people in Los Angeles believe that
Anschutz Entertainment ultimately will come back with another plan
for a stadium near Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   They base that judgment on private statements by Anschutz
Entertainment executives and most of all on the determination of
Philip Anschutz, the billionaire principal owner of the Anschutz
group of companies and a man whose name one day could be classed with
those of Huntington, Chandler, Wilshire and others</TE>
<TE>   who remade the Los Angeles landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz's fortune and reputation are under a cloud at the moment
because of the steep decline in the stock of Qwest Communications
International Inc., a telecommunications company he founded and
continues to lead as chairman of the executive committee and the
firm's largest shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
Qwest's management artificially inflated earnings in 2001 to enable
Anschutz and other executives to sell stock at high prices.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz also sold to Qwest a troubled digital video company owned
by another of his companies, causing Qwest last year to take a
$33-million write-off--and raising shareholders' protests.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest stock closed Friday at $4.59 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, compared with more than $30 a year ago and more than $60
two years ago. Anschutz's wealth may total about $5 billion, rather
than the $9.6 billion Forbes listed for him last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Qwest's troubles don't seem to be slowing Anschutz's building
plans in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz Entertainment Group is building a national soccer and
tennis center at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, where the NFL's
San Diego Chargers will train.</TE>
<TE>   On acreage adjacent to Staples Center, Anschutz is starting work
on construction of a retail, theater and hotel complex.</TE>
<TE>   Regal Entertainment Group, majority-owned by Anschutz, has become
the country's largest theater owner, combining three chains including
Orange County-based Edwards Cinema Co. He has a long-term vision for
re-adapting theaters for the digital age that goes beyond the
industry's current rebound from a slump lasting several years.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz Pacific Pipeline Co. owns an oil pipeline running through
Los Angeles from Sylmar in the San Fernando Valley to refineries in
Wilmington in the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Anschutz remains relatively little known to the public
because he chooses not to talk to the media.</TE>
<TE>   But businesspeople don't find him secretive.</TE>
<TE>   Those who like him say he's "a straight dealer, an excellent
businessman who can spot the weaknesses or strengths in a project,"
in the words of Joseph Alibrandi, retired chairman of North Hollywood
aerospace components maker Whittaker Corp., who has had dealings with
Anschutz for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Those who dislike Anschutz say he is opportunistic and not
civic-minded or generous with charitable contributions. But even
leading businesspeople request anonymity before criticizing Anschutz.
Among other reasons, many hope to do business with his companies.</TE>
<TE>   Civic Involvement</TE>
<TE>   An irony is that for all of Anschutz's supposed lack of civic-</TE>
<TE>   mindedness, his business has been intricately involved with
politics and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   From 1983 to 1995, Anschutz owned Southern Pacific Railroad. So he
owned the rights of way along Alameda Street in 1993, when Los
Angeles needed them for the Alameda Corridor freight system, and the
railroad transferred the rights of way to the corridor project.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Anschutz had a pending proposal for the
Sylmar-Wilmington oil pipeline, recalls then-Deputy Los Angeles Mayor
Steve Soboroff, now president of the Playa Vista real estate
development.</TE>
<TE>   "He was straightforward, not high-pressure, in his dealings,"</TE>
<TE>   Soboroff says.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Anschutz did get a green light for his oil pipeline
project, to which he added rights for a Qwest fiber-optic line into
Los Angeles. He beat out a rival fiber-</TE>
<TE>   optic proposal by Southern California Edison, the utility unit of
Edison International. Simultaneously,</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz received permits to build Staples Center and to acquire</TE>
<TE>   adjacent land for future development.</TE>
<TE>   Staples, built for $400 million, has proved a success, with the
basketball teams Lakers and Clippers and hockey's Kings, along with
concerts, the Arena Football League and others using the stadium
about 280 nights a year. Anschutz retains 50% ownership of Staples as
well as fractional ownership of the Lakers and Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The adjacent acreage that Anschutz acquired is worth more than
$200 million, even before development of a proposed retail, dining
and hotel complex.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Anschutz is betting on the growth of Los Angeles and this
region.</TE>
<TE>   Investing in Technology</TE>
<TE>   But Anschutz's visions go beyond real estate.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he founded Qwest by laying fiber-optic cables along
the multi-state rights of way of Southern Pacific. (Then, in 1995, he
sold the railroad to Union Pacific Corp., of which he still is vice
chairman and the largest shareholder.)</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz's plan for Qwest was to build a nationwide fiber-optic
network for Internet communi-</TE>
<TE>   cations. And that was a good idea--so good that AT&amp;T Corp.,
WorldCom Inc., Sprint Corp., the regional Bell operating companies,
Global Crossing Ltd. and several other firms built fiber-optic
networks too.</TE>
<TE>   The result, as everybody knows by now, was a massive overabundance
of fiber-optic lines and under-abundance of customers.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Qwest has fallen in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz has sold about 16% of his Qwest holdings, worth about</TE>
<TE>   $2 billion. The SEC is investigating the timing and circumstances
of early-2001 stock sales. Anschutz retains 301 million shares, or
18%, of the Denver-based company, and has hired a new chief executive
who proposes to sell assets to pay down debt.</TE>
<TE>   Staying the Course</TE>
<TE>   But Anschutz continues to pursue a vision for the possibilities of
fiber optics and digital distribution of entertainment. That is why
he has acquired control of movie theater chains in recent years, why
he owns five of the 10 teams in Major League Soccer and why he has
been trying to make headway in the concert-management business.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees the content of sports and entertainment providing real
value to network possibilities," says telecommunications consultant
Peter Bernstein of Infonautics Consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz looks ahead to the digital distribution of movies
bringing a dramatic reduction in distribution costs for studios--cost
savings his companies can share. He foresees digital distribution of
sporting events and concerts in theaters or arenas such as Staples
and others his companies own in Britain and Germany as attractions
that transcend languages and borders.</TE>
<TE>   He has invited the Mexican national soccer team to play in his
soccer center, scheduled to open next year on the Cal State campus in
Carson. The Los Angeles Galaxy, which Anschutz owns, also will play
there.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz's vision, as Qwest's misfortunes demonstrate, may not
work out immediately. But he perseveres. Whether the NFL ever comes
back to Los Angeles, Anschutz, for better or worse, seems to be here
to stay.</TE>

<HD>The New Tax Breaks--Now You See Them, Now You Don't</HD>
<DH>With deductions phasing in and out over the next decade,
Americans may find it more difficult to plan for the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent unsuccessful efforts to make permanent some of the tax
breaks passed by Congress last summer--such as abolishing the estate
tax--underscore warnings that tax experts issued soon after the tax
bill was passed: It's tough to make long-term financial plans when
important tax issues are in flux.</LD>
<LD>   "It is absolutely impossible for the average American to figure
out what's going on over the next 10 years," said John S. Barry,
chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit tax
research group based in Washington. "The fact that all of these tax
breaks are temporary and phasing in and phasing out makes it
impossible to plan."</LD>
<LD>   Last summer's tax law created several new breaks for people with
children, those financing college, those saving for retirement and
those wanting to leave their heirs substantial estates.</LD>
<TE>   However, the law was drawn up based on an obscure rule that
doesn't allow budget-affecting changes to last longer than 10 years.
As the result, the 2001 law expires Jan. 1, 2011.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, to address certain popular policy goals--such as
reducing the tax cost of marriage for two-income couples--while
making shorter-term budget projections work out, Congress decreed
that some provisions of the law phase in and phase out before 2011.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the law created a new tax deduction for those paying
tuition and fees for higher education. The maximum deduction is
$3,000 this year; it rises to $4,000 during 2004 and 2005. But it
disappears in 2006, said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst for CCH
Inc., a Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of tax information.</TE>
<TE>   Why? The provision was expensive, and the money to fund it was
needed to help pay for the lower tax rates included in the 2001
package, and to provide relief from the so-called marriage penalty.
Marriage-penalty relief ramps up in 2005 and evaporates at the end of
2010.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Unknown</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to know what to do," said Martin Nissenbaum, director
of personal tax planning with Ernst &amp; Young in Washington. "We have a
tax law that we know is going to expire. Meanwhile, we have a
Congress capable of making new laws, and we have no idea what else
they're going to do to us in the next eight years."</TE>
<TE>   Temporary breaks are never intended to stay that way, tax experts
say. Supporters of the changes believe the breaks will prove so
popular that legislators will be pressured to find a way to make them
permanent. And certainly, the money was found to extend
once-temporary tax breaks for adoption and for workers who get
financial aid from their employer to attend school.</TE>
<TE>   But to extend or create any new tax cut, Congress must find a way
to pay for it. Often that means some other tax break or government
project must fall by the wayside. And those projects have supporters
too.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, House Republicans were rebuffed in their efforts to make
last summer's changes to estate taxes and the marriage penalty
permanent, illustrating just how tough it can be to extend a tax
break--even a popular one--when the federal budget is tight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, taxpayers are left to guess whether the breaks they're
banking on will be there when they're needed.</TE>
<TE>   The best strategy for saving for college expenses often is
dictated by how a particular savings vehicle might be taxed, for
instance. But do parents dare put their toddler's college savings in
a 529 savings plan when the federal tax exclusions that make these
plans economically viable are set to expire before the child enrolls
in school?</TE>
<TE>   Most experts say they should, because Congress has a long record
of extending popular tax breaks. And few have proved as politically
popular as those that finance education.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff that has overwhelming bipartisan support will probably
get renewed," said Philip J. Holthouse, partner at Los Angeles tax
law and accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt. "I would be
more cautious about planning your future on figuring that the estate
tax changes are going to be around--or even banking on some of the
marriage-penalty fixes."</TE>
<TE>   The estate tax presents a particularly bewildering dilemma. Death
is difficult to plan on a schedule, and the law as written almost
requires one.</TE>
<TE>   The amount that individuals can leave to their heirs rises
substantially over the next eight years, potentially providing a huge
benefit to heirs of those who survive until the ninth year, when the
estate tax is eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   But in 2011, the tax reverts to what was in place before the 2001
law, cutting back the amount that can be left tax-free to heirs to $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   "The joke when they brought in this estate tax law was that we
were all going to spend the next 10 years undoing what we'd spent the
last 10 years doing, and then spend the next 10 years reconstructing
it again," said Charles Rettig, a tax attorney with Hochman, Salkin,
Rettig, Toscher &amp; Perez.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress doesn't address the estate tax, people will have to
redraft their wills every year or create incredibly complex documents
that bequeath assets differently based on the year that the
individual dies, Nissenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   "The estate-planning provisions are just making everyone crazy,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   System Is the Problem</TE>
<TE>   And experts can offer taxpayers little in the way of a solution,
except advice to be vigilant in keeping their documents up to date
and providing as much flexibility as possible in their written plans,
Rettig said.</TE>
<TE>   But the real problem is the system by which tax laws get passed,
said Barry of the Tax Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, a government office releases a projection of how the
economy is likely to perform, and consequently, how much the
government is likely to pull in through tax revenues over the next 10
years. Congressional rules encourage legislators to shoehorn tax
revisions made during that time frame into those projections, Barry
said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that economic predictions are notoriously
inaccurate--even over short periods.</TE>
<TE>   "As we are finding out right now, it's practically impossible to
look out even one month and hope to be right," Barry said.
"Predicting what the economy will do over 10 years is simply an
impossible task."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, when writing tax laws, legislators rely on "sunset"
provisions and income thresholds that bar many taxpayers from taking
advantage of new provisions. That, in turn, can subvert the intended
goal of the tax break, which probably was aimed at encouraging some
public policy goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Fundamentally, what we should be looking at when setting tax
policy is principals," Barry said. "Congress has to stop basing tax
policy on budget projections that are simply impossible to make."</TE>

after a specified period, making financial planning difficult for

<HD>Strategists Scale Back Forecast for S&amp;P 500 but Still
Predict a Gain</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Experts expect growth to 1,250 this year or
next, a 9% rise over 2001. That would be a 26% rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PER JEBSEN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wall Street investment strategists, the dream merchants of the late
1990s bull market, have largely sobered up along with many of their
clients.</LD>
<LD>   But a Reuters poll of 10 top brokerage strategists last week still
produced a median forecast that the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index would
rise to 1,250 by year-end or sometime next year.</LD>
<LD>   That is scaled back from the last Reuters survey in March, when
the mid-range forecast was 1,338.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, it would be a 9% gain from the S&amp;P's 2001 close of 1,148
and would require a 26% rally from Friday's close of 989.14.</TE>
<TE>   Chastened bulls pinned their hopes on what they expect will be a
rebound in corporate earnings as the economy recovers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many of the pundits articulate a more conservative outlook
than their predictions would indicate.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is still highly speculative," said Richard Bernstein,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief strategist. "People should focus on
capital preservation ... look at boring businesses ... look away from
mainstream tech and hot stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein has a 1,200 target for the S&amp;P 500, but he says stocks
are overvalued as measured by the average price-to-earnings ratio and
average projected earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   The most bearish pundits refuse to rule out more pain for
investors, even though the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by more than one-third
from its March 2000 peak and the Nasdaq composite has plunged more
than 70% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein worries that some investors remain more concerned with
missing a possible positive earnings surprise from a technology
company than with the potential for war between nuclear-armed India
and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an optimal combination of capital appreciation and
capital preservation," he said. "The needle has been turned up too
high on capital appreciation."</TE>
<TE>   A rising "equity risk premium"--the extra return investors require
because of stock volatility--is limiting the market, said Tobias
Levkovich, strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this sense of corporate rot," said Levkovich, who last
week cut his year-end S&amp;P 500 target to a range of 1,200 to 1,250
from 1,300 to 1,350.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in February, it was Enron, but now it's Tyco, Imclone,
Dynegy," he said. "It makes investors a little less willing to buy
stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley chief U.S. strategist Steve Galbraith said the
market needs not just improved corporate profits but also more
confidence in reported earnings in order to rise.</TE>
<TE>   "What investors need to see, and soon, is the whites of the eyes
of corporate earnings growth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But another fear is that even an improving economy may not lift
stocks for long before the Federal Reserve will begin tightening
credit again, said Banc of America Securities strategist Tom McManus.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group's chief investment strategist, Abby Joseph
Cohen, said that investors' fears are overdone and that stocks
probably will rise within the next six to 12 months to the S&amp;P 500's
"fair value," which she puts at 1,300--a 31% gain from current
levels.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said that the basics of economic and corporate performance
are increasingly sound, and that companies have done an effective job
of reducing investors' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Valuation models based on price-to-earnings ratios that suggest
stocks are overpriced ignore factors such as inflation and interest
rates, Cohen said. Moreover, the weakening of the U.S. dollar may
boost exports and profits of multinational firms, while encouraging
structural reforms in other countries, she said.</TE>

<LD>What a strong, brave soul Tammy Bruce is ("The Disaffection of
Tammy Bruce," by Fred Dickey, June 2). Her ability to clearly think
through issues by applying pure reason is absolutely invaluable, both to
women in particular and citizens as a whole. Time after time she has
resisted the idiotic "group think" pressures emanating from the left. In
fact, the convoluted logic of the left is beginning to sound more and
more daft compared to Bruce. She gets my vote. The woman speaks the truth
as she sees it, and the powers that be be damned.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce is to the gay community what Al Sharpton is to the black
community--a huckster and a con artist. When someone who claims to be an
individualist rushes to the defense of monsters such as Laura
Schlessinger by arguing that economic boycotts are immoral, you know
you've stumbled across a fraud. Bruce has no interest in advancing the
individual rights of gay Americans; her only concern lies in advancing
herself. Do we see her on the barricades for gay marriage or gays in the
military? No, she is busy shielding the religious right from criticism.
So much for an advocate of gay Americans.</TE>

<LD>One certainly admires the research work done by Craig Stanford on
the great apes ("Open the Labs and Set Them Free?" by Douglas Foster,
June 2). Indeed, it is a stimulating fact that chimpanzees are
genetically 98% the same as humans. However, it is deeply disturbing when
Stanford compares chimps to 2-year-old children and, even more appalling,
to a "cognitively impaired adult."</LD>
<LD>   All the great apes are magnificent animals, and they should not be
compared to higher or lower forms of life. If all were really well with
the world, we would leave them in their own environment. They should not
be in laboratories enduring horrifying experiments and being injected
with HIV. After all, pain is pain, and genetically their nerves must be
as sensitive as ours. They must have feelings of imprisonment and
hopelessness too. Many cries would be heard if we experimented on pandas.
Why is there so little reaction for a fine and helpless chimp?</LD>
<LD>   Joyce Howard</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for an incisive article outlining a great dilemma: we
experiment on great apes because they are so like us, but if they are so
like us, how can we experiment on them? As caretakers of the earth, we
humans must take our heads out of the sand, our hands out of our pockets
and move this argument forward--beyond the "why, next they'll be taking
the meat out of my mouth" fear of vegetarians. Not every first step leads
to a slippery slope. We must find a moral and ethical balance that
protects the rights of animals as well as human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Smith</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foster writes that psychologist Daniel Povinelli believes the human
ability to "speculate about the internal lives of other beings"
distinguishes humans from all other animals. For years, research has
shown that nonhuman animals do, in fact, "speculate about the internal
lives" of others by showing compassion for other beings. If animals act
as if they understand something, we have all the evidence that can
possibly be gathered that they understand it. If Povinelli wants to argue
that nonhuman animals do not have moral lives, he ought to provide some
behavioral evidence instead of just relying on dogma. The behavior of
animals has shown us that nonhuman animals are not just thoughtless
beings that we can torture and confine without moral consequence.</TE>

<LD>IF THE LAKERS WANT TO KEEP KOBE BRYANT FROM INGESTING TAINTED FOOD,
they might want to consider hiring Lulu Powers, personal chef to the
stars. "They should have a chef on the road with them," Powers says.
"That's not a strange thing." She should know. Her company, Lulu Powers
Food to Flowers, caters to a virtual Who's Who of Hollywood as well as
plenty of less-famous gourmets. A character on an episode of the "The
X-Files" was even named "Lulu" in tribute to Powers, who catered for the
show and its creator, Chris Carter.</LD>
<LD>   Powers began her culinary career at the age of 11 in her mother's
catering business. Nantucket author and chef Sarah Leah Chase recommended
Powers at age 14 for a job as a private chef. She studied English and
theater at Marymount Manhattan College, honed her acting chops in
commercials and moved to Los Angeles in 1994. "I thought I'd move to
L.A., create a TV show and that would be it," she says with a grin. But a
friend in Pacific Palisades asked her to help with a birthday party, and
one rave review led to another.</LD>
<LD>   "Sigourney Weaver's people asked if I'd come over and cook. I made
swordfish with mango salsa, wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus. She was
doing 'Alien Resurrection' and working out three hours a day. Her driver
would pick up her food twice a day."</LD>
<TE>   After a write-up in Vogue magazine, Powers was hired as a personal
chef to photographer Herb Ritts. When Powers married photographer Stephen
Danelian a few years ago, Ritts shot the couple's reception with a
throwaway camera to accompany George Christy's full-page story in the
Hollywood Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Catering celebrity parties is also a big business for Powers, who has
thrown a record-release shindig for Stevie Nicks, a New Year's bash for
Leonardo DiCaprio and a baby shower this spring for Debi Mazar hosted by
Madonna. Confidentiality agreements keep her from dishing any meaty
gossip, but Powers does offer a few crumbs: "My favorite clients are Will
and Jada [Pinkett] Smith," she says. "I cook for them on Sundays. Rupert
Everett is a really nice guy. He called after my dog was hit by a car.
After that, he couldn't do wrong in my eyes." Her most interesting
request so far has been a vegan (non-meat, non-dairy) party for Joaquin
Phoenix a couple of nights before the 2001 Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing portions for dieting celebrities can be a diplomatic
challenge, Powers says. "If a person is doing a film and needs to slim
down, I recommend they cut out all dairy and fats and go with smaller
portions of vegetables and protein. Or, eat as many green vegetables as
you want and portion your protein, whether it's fish, chicken or meat."
On the other hand, Powers is known for her caramel fudge brownies,
definitely off-limits for some clients. Her alternative is baked apples
with golden raisins and cinnamon. "You have to be creative," she says. "I
never follow recipes."</TE>
<TE>   As for recent trends in menu choices, Powers notes a return to comfort
foods such as "macaroni and cheese in little bowls as hors d'oeuvres, or
even mini grilled cheese sandwiches instead of truffles vinaigrette over
asparagus with caviar. People want to live simpler lives. They like good
old food." That category would includes Powers' own favorite meal. "I
love hot dogs from the Hebrew National stand at Costco."</TE>

<DH>Artist Clare Crespo Wants You to Play With Your Food</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MADDEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asked what she does for a living, food artist Clare Crespo
responds, "I bake weird cupcakes." Now there's an understatement:
Crespo's art uses photography, sculpture and a demented sense of whimsy
to create magical domains where birds' birthdays are cause for
celebration, cupcakes sprout wings and sushi becomes a theme for
crocheted art pieces. Her new cookbook, "The Secret Life of Food,"
invites kids of all ages to enter her fantastical world, and glimpse her
Caterpillar Cake inching down the garden path.</LD>
<LD>   Filled with recipes and edible sight gags such as Football Meatloaf,
Mutant Chicken and Monster Head Potatoes, the book's rich, glossy
photographs are as at home on the Noguchi coffee table as in the
frosting-encrusted hands of a kid. Crespo's youthful sensibility
manifests itself in concoctions including Banana Dog (a banana served in
a hot dog bun) and luridly colored, icy Hand Punch, and in one-of-a-kind
commissions such as a "fire-breathing Siamese twins cake" for a party of
150. "I actually lit the thing on fire using a lemon juice pyrotechnic
trick, and used red velvet cake. Things got even sicker when I decided to
run red whip licorice arteries through the arms and legs, making it
really hard to cut apart."</LD>
<TE>   Crespo, 34, admits that a lot of her creations are "a little bit
weird" and refers to her artistic vision as "the magical nonsense inside
my brain." She earned a master's in experimental animation at CalArts,
played bass "very badly" in a band with alternative rock star Beck and
produced music videos for such innovative directors as Spike Jonze
("Being John Malkovich"). "Being with all of these people was inspiring,
and that's when I started some of my own projects, like the crocheted
food pieces, on the side to keep me sane."</TE>
<TE>   Now she focuses strictly on her own creative pursuits (both edible and
otherwise), splitting her time between quirky commissions ("I was hired
to do a family portrait in mashed potatoes!"), her column, "MadFlavaz,"
for pop culture magazine Tokion, writing her lesson plan for another
stint at the New School of Cooking in Culver City and preparing for an
art show June 22 at the Annex in Chinatown. "For this show, I'm making
giant soft-sculpture [stuffed fabric and vinyl] cupcakes, which will be
amazing against blue skies. But afterward, I picture them in a kid's
room--wouldn't it be great to see some kid sitting on one, talking on the
phone?"</TE>
<TE>   What it all comes down to for Crespo is a commitment to accessible
art, and the desire to find creativity and joy in life's daily grind.
"I'm not in my studio with my chisel and marble. I'm on my couch,
watching the Lakers, crocheting a hamburger!"</TE>

<HD>A Classic All-American Thai Hamburger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA SAPERSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until recently, the burgers and fries at Silver Lake's Thai
American Express Cafe were a well-kept secret among neighborhood
residents. The unassuming 20-year-old diner (13 years in its current
location) has long been a favorite stop for students from Ivanhoe
Elementary to buy steamed rice after school--in fact, no Thai food "to be
brought back" is a rule in the school handbook. But in the past few
months, news of Thai-American's succulent burgers has been leaking out,
fueled by word of mouth and postings on www.chowhound.com, a Web site
where foodies trade restaurant raves and rants.</LD>
<TE>   Manager Pete Bunnag seems a bit surprised at the sudden popularity.
"People are calling from North Hollywood, Pasadena, everywhere lately,"
he reports. The basic burger starts at $3.45--not bad, considering its
heft, three-quarter pound to 1 pound of meat. But the thing to order is
the dauntingly enormous hamburger platter, at $7.45. A modest green salad
with bean sprouts and a tangy Thai dressing kicks off the meal, which
features an outsize patty with a pleasantly light texture and subtle
flavor, like some sort of juicy pan-Asian meatloaf. Any pretension to
lightness, however, is dispelled by the trimmings that come with the
platter: cheese slices, sauteed mushrooms, heaps of perfectly caramelized
peppered onions and, for a touch of excess, bacon. Avocado is also an
option. Next to this decadent heap of flavors nestles a pile of perfectly
browned, hand-cut, glistening-hot fries. Bunnag says there's no secret
recipe to the burger, "just USDA choice beef, made fresh."</TE>
<TE>   Thai American actually started out serving American fare; the menu
also lists a salad with alfalfa sprouts as well as an incongruous
selection of Eastern European comfort food and, of course, those burgers.
A few years later, the Thai owners decided that the neighborhood was
ready for some favorite Thai dishes as well. A Thai restaurant that
serves chicken Kiev and health food, where hamburgers are the most
popular item? Only in America.</TE>

<LD>When professional chefs want a new flavor of ice cream, Mike
Nademlynsky is the man they call. Funky Fig, Lavender Honey, Chai Tea and
Prickly Pear are just some of the creations the ice cream designer
concocts in his small warehouse in Cypress. "I love the challenge," says
Nademlynsky, whose Florentino Ice Cream line offers more than 100
flavors. "I just made a tarragon sorbet for a hotel in San Diego, and a
New Jersey hotel wants pomegranate sorbet. I don't have any salesmen.
People just find out about me from word of mouth."</LD>
<LD>   You can't buy his creations in a supermarket, but if you dine at a
Hilton or Starwood hotel, you may find his confections on the menu. His
specialty items are also among the dessert offerings at upscale area
restaurants such as the Inn of the Seventh Ray in Topanga Canyon, Maple
Drive in Beverly Hills and Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Nademlynsky escaped from then-Communist Czechoslovakia in 1969 with
his wife and three children and found his way to Los Angeles after an
initial stay in Chicago. The city of Los Angeles hired him as a contract
diver to repair pilings in the harbor, but Nademlynsky really wanted to
have his own business. Homesick for European pastry and espresso, he
opened a European-style cafe in 1982 (which he closed in 1987) and began
to experiment with making the Italian ice cream, gelato.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States, to me, was always freedom," says Nademlynsky, 64.
"Here everybody comes from somewhere else, and I feel at home. Even when
my English was lousy, people would help me because they saw me working
hard and trying to make something."</TE>
<TE>   Today, despite the exotic offerings in his inventory, Nademlynsky's
best-selling flavor is still Vanilla Bean. But not just ordinary vanilla,
mind you--Nademlynsky's version mixes sun-dried vanilla flavorings from
Tahiti, Madagacar and several other countries in a secret formula that he
proudly says is "like no other vanilla you will ever taste."</TE>

<LD>As we emerge from an economic slump, Los Angeles is eating out
again--at old favorites and at notable places that have opened within the
past 12 months. The city has seen a bumper crop of new restaurants from
innovative chefs going out on their own for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Seven restaurants are especially noteworthy--from an earthy Italian
osteria to a modern American chophouse to a smart neighborhood restaurant
fusing Filipino with French.</LD>
<LD>   In the pages that follow, we meet the faces behind the new places. We
also offer a guide to the rest of the region's top restaurants and a
listing of our favorite spots that don't cost a fortune.</LD>

<LD>Angelini Osteria/GINO ANGELINI</LD>
<LD>   At 14, Gino Angelini was learning to cook in Rimini, the resort town
on the Adriatic where he grew up. He came up through the hotel system
there, and had been a regional president at the Italian Chefs Assn. when
restaurateur Mauro Vincenti discovered him and brought him to Los Angeles
to become chef at Rex il Ristorante.</LD>
<LD>   Angelini has been here ever since, following Vincenti's widow,
Maureen, to Vincenti, her Brentwood Italian restaurant, which he helped
open. But after decades of cooking for someone else, Angelini finally
opened his own place. It's simply the best new Italian in years because
it's truly Italian--not California-Italian or Italian leaning toward
French. This is earthy and sensual Italian food, cooked with passion and
finesse.</LD>
<TE>   The current menu may be Angelini Osteria's best yet. For antipasti,
there's vitello tonnato and warm octopus salad. Primi include a summery
lemon-lime risotto with asparagus and mint or tagliatelle with rabbit
ragu. He roasts veal shanks in the wood-burning oven and serves tender,
sweet cuttlefish with tripe. No wonder Italians are turning up in droves.
"He cooks like my mother," more than one homesick Italian has said. Now
the rest of us can all pretend. Angelini Osteria, 7313 Beverly Blvd., Los
Angeles; (323) 297-0070. Entrees, $16 to $30.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Red Pearl Kitchen/TIM GOODELL</TE>
<TE>   Tim Goodell, 36, may be one of Southern California's most accomplished
chefs trained in French cuisine. Though he's best known for the formal
Aubergine in Newport Beach, he still knows how to kick back. He grew up
in Orange County, so the siren call of sand and surf is hardly
surprising. He also has Troquet, a bistro at South Coast Plaza. So he and
partner-wife Liza had something different in mind for their third
restaurant: fun and casual, the kind of place where you could relax after
a long day.</TE>
<TE>   And that's what Red Pearl Kitchen is. Housed in an old brick building
in downtown Huntington Beach, the restaurant is awash in red silk
lampshades, which set the raucous scene. Goodell adds Asian touches to
his menus with brilliant effect, and he relished the idea of doing
something more playful with Asian cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Red Pearl tempts the beach crowd with lots of little dishes to
share--Shanghai skillet-steamed dumplings, Vietnamese spring rolls and
winning Chinese five-spice pork short ribs with Thai basil, to name a
few. There are bowls of soup thick with noodles, and a terrific dish of
Chinese sweet sausage, rice noodles and lemon grass. Some people stop
right there, but if you're really hungry, order up beef filet with wide
rice noodles in a black bean and oyster sauce or the tangerine peel
chicken with bird's eye chile. Save room</TE>
<TE>   for pastry chef Shelly Register's kaffir lime and lemon grass panna
cotta. Red Pearl Kitchen, 412 Walnut St., Huntington Beach; (714)
969-0224. Entrees, $8 to $17.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jar/ SUZANNE TRACHT</TE>
<TE>   Women are rare among head chefs at top restaurants. Nevertheless
Suzanne Tracht was chef de cuisine at Campanile and opening chef at Jozu,
where she indulged an interest in fusing Asian cuisine with California
style and ingredients. After her Campanile days, she and Mark Peel, who
is chef and co-owner of Campanile, talked about opening a restaurant
together. Before they had a space, they had a name: Jar. And by the time
the former Indochine space on Beverly Boulevard came up for lease, the
two were ready to jump. The result is a terrific American chophouse in a
pared-down contemporary setting, with classic cocktails that draw a young
industry crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But the real action is in the kitchen. Tracht cooks food for people
who like to eat: perfectly fried Ipswich clams, bright-tasting lobster
cocktails, a salad of haricots verts and shiitake mushrooms fenced in
with Parma prosciutto. She's got sand dabs, a seductive marinated skirt
steak and a bone-in New York strip as well as an uptown pot roast made
with boned short ribs. Her sides are delightful, too, from pea tendrils
with garlic to a potato au gratin, and a mix of English peas, crimini
mushrooms and pearl onions. As for her desserts, oh, the choices.
Strawberry pie with creme fra'che whipped cream or banana cream pie? Or,
better yet, that velvety chocolate pudding? Jar, 8225 Beverly Blvd., Los
Angeles; (323) 655-6566. Entrees, $19 to $29.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cobras &amp; Matadors/STEVEN ARROYO</TE>
<TE>   Steven Arroyo isn't afraid to change his mind. When Boxer, his clubby
California restaurant across from CBS headquarters on Beverly Boulevard,
faltered after the departures of Neal Fraser and then Brooke Williamson,
he simply regrouped and opened something less chef-driven and closer to
his heart--a tapas restaurant called Cobras &amp; Matadors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a very casual person and it's a casual environment," says Arroyo,
who decorated the space with black-and-white photos of his family in the
'20s. He and 21-year-old chef Cristian Martinez have created a menu of
little dishes and savories designed for sharing: gazpacho, grilled
octopus with green sauce, albondigas (meatballs), wood-oven roasted
mushrooms, mussels and chorizo. Next door at his wine shop, Bicentennial
13, the wines are exclusively Spanish (the first such shop in the
nation), where reasonably priced bottles can be purchased and enjoyed at
the restaurant. The atmosphere is lively and fun, the more so the later
it gets.</TE>
<TE>   This just in: Arroyo has opened an American chophouse in Los Feliz
called The Hillmont--pitched to the same sort of crowd, with steaks,
chops and other comfort food at moderate prices. Cobras &amp; Matadors, 7615
W. Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (323) 932-6178. Dishes, $3 to $13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   G. Garvin's/GERRY B. GARVIN</TE>
<TE>   Gerry B. Garvin cooked behind the scenes at places such as Morton's
and the late Kass Bah in West Hollywood before heading to Reign, football
player Keyshawn Johnson's slick Southern restaurant in Beverly Hills.
Anything but down-home, Garvin's renditions of fried chicken, smothered
pork chops and all those delicious Southern sides made quite an
impression there.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's back with his own restaurant on West 3rd Street. Sorry, he's
not doing Southern--except for some sneaky "too tender" baby back ribs he
serves as an appetizer, of all things. He'd like to do more, but not
without a real pit. Nevertheless, this small, sleekly tailored restaurant
has become a late-night music industry hangout, where the soundtrack on
any given night can veer from Mary J. Blige to Alicia Keys.</TE>
<TE>   But the real draw is his intelligent California cuisine--tequila
shrimp, golden crab cakes, artful salads. Come to this savvy neighborhood
spot for a good steak, an oven-roasted chicken or a trio of delicious
lamb chops. It's all good. But where's my Southern fried chicken? G.
Garvin's, 8420 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles; (323) 655-3888. Entrees, $21 to

<TE>   Alex/ALEX SCRIMGEOUR</TE>
<TE>   It takes self-confidence for a young chef to move into the late Citrus
on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles--where Michel Richard once dazzled with
his startlingly inventive California-French cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   For almost a year that roomy site just sat there, empty, waiting for
someone to ask it to dance.</TE>
<TE>   Enter young Brit Alex Scrimgeour, who last cooked at Saddle Peak Lodge
in Malibu Canyon, in search of a more formal setting for his contemporary
European cuisine. Presto chango: leather club chairs in the bar, dark
wood beams overhead and an Arts and Crafts-inspired decor have swept away
the memory of Citrus' whitewashed room and white market umbrellas. With a
prix fixe menu that marches through four courses (with lots of choices),
the young Cordon Bleu-trained chef is betting on fine dining to make a
comeback in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   While not everything works all the time, you have to admire
Scrimgeour's chutzpah and the breadth of his menu at Alex, where you can
find wood-grilled pigeon with chanterelles, grilled langoustine with
anchovy butter, coriander-crusted skate wing or Colorado rack of lamb.
Alex, 6703 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (323) 933-5233. Entrees, $32.
Four-course prix fixe menu, $60.</TE>

<TE>   Max/ANDRE GUERRERO</TE>
<TE>   Fresh from Linq and a trendy scene where nobody paid much attention to
the food, Andre Guerrero is happily cooking in his own place. After 24
years behind the stoves, it's about time. Lucky enough to nab the former
JoeJoe's space in Sherman Oaks, he named his restaurant Max, after his
son. He took that boxy storefront and, with a few clever changes, turned
it into something smart and inviting.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the neighborhood," Guerrero will tell anybody asking. And from
the first few weeks of business, it's clear the neighborhood likes him.
Max is thronged.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero's cooking is fusion all the way, a style he introduced at
Duet in Glendale when he was chef there years ago, and some of his old
customers have followed him here. He's Filipino, so he couldn't resist
putting on the menu lumpia (shrimp and pork spring rolls) and grilled
"hawker's chicken," skewers of chicken breast with a jolt of green papaya
relish. There's an intricately spiced Thai lemon grass coconut soup,
miniature ahi tuna towers with a thatch of nori seaweed, and an intense
mushroom risotto with a French duck confit. He still makes a mean New
York pepper steak entirely crusted with cracked peppercorns. In short,
Max has something for everyone, which may be why it looks as if the
entire Valley has dropped in for dinner. Max, 13355 Ventura Blvd.,
Sherman Oaks; (818) 784-2915. Entrees, $15 to $24.</TE>

<DH>From Southern California's Most Sophisticated Menus, the Dishes
That    Inspire</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Set in a former Googie-inspired coffee shop, with an outdoor lounge
that has low-slung Parsons couches and shoji screens, [temple] attracts a
young, fashionable crowd. Chef Richard Aramino has created L.A.'s first
crossover Korean. To traditional dishes and flavors he adds accents of
Brazil (where owners Jun and Soyon Kim grew up) and California.
Appetizers perfect for grazing include hand-pleated rock shrimp
dumplings, crab cakes laced with kimchi and an ornate seafood pancake.
Every entree comes with an array of panchan, side dishes. And to drink,
the bartender concocts Soju Caipirinha. Temple, 14 N. La Cienega Blvd.,
Beverly Hills; (310) 360-9460. Entrees, $12 to $22.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   [ALTO PALATO] is a stylish Italian restaurant that consistently turns
out wonderful thin-crusted pizzas and rustic regional pasta dishes in a
roomy contemporary setting. At the aperitif hour, the bar serves up a
well-chosen selection of Italian cheeses and wines by the glass. On
Wednesday nights tour the regions of Italy via a special $25 prix fixe
menu that features a different region each week. Wine drinkers have an
incentive: If you order the regional menu, any bottle of wine is 40% off.
And for dessert, what else but the homemade gelato? Alto Palato, 755 N.
La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 657-9271. Pizzas, $10 to $14.
Entrees, $11 to $25.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nobu Matsuhisa has restaurants from here to New York, London and
Paris--even Tokyo. But [MATSUHISA] is the original, where he honed his
peculiar fusion of Peruvian and Japanese flavors. The straightforward
sushi is excellent, but his regulars can't get enough of "new-style
sashimi" doused with warm olive oil, squid "pasta" with asparagus, and
seafood perked up with his signature sauces. The presentation is
arresting, and the normally austere Japanese palette of flavors is
punched up with garlic, chile, even butter. Reserve a seat at the tempura
bar, which serves an omakase (chef's choice) that includes his latest
creations. Matsuhisa, 129 N. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310)
659-9639. Entrees, $20 to $50. Omakase, $75.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [BALBOA RESTAURANT &amp; LOUNGE] is not your father's steakhouse. Set
inside The Grafton on Sunset hotel, the restaurant's edgy design attracts
a young, hip crowd. Instead of whiskey and sodas, the bar turns out
unusual cocktails--the weirder the better. Tables are small and the noise
level extreme, but the beef is prime and aged to the max. The superlative
New York steak is aged about 40 days. First courses stand out from the
crowd, too. When there's a pecan tart on the menu, why skip dessert?
Balboa Restaurant &amp; Lounge, 8383 W. Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood; (323)
650-8383. Entrees, $16 to $39.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Everything from the sea, both near and far, appears on [WATER GRILL'S]
menu. Under chef Michael Cimarusti, this once-moribund seafood house has
become the city's best. Stop in before the theater or a concert for
oysters from the raw bar, or try a bowl of the fabulous white clam
chowder laced with applewood-smoked bacon. His big-eye tuna tartare is
superb; so are the loup de mer with fennel and the Columbia river salmon.
And the desserts, from pastry chef Wonyee Tom, are worth every calorie.
Water Grill, 544 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 891-0900. Entrees, $25
to $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The address of [BISTRO 21] for a long time was jealously guarded by
the lucky few who happened on it by chance or had followed chef/owner
Koichiro Kikuchi from his days at La Boheme. With only a handful of
tables and no chance of a scene in his mini-mall location, Kikuchi
concentrates on the food: for example, a puristi's lobster bisque, seared
foie gras on a pedestal of braised daikon, lobster in a swath of emerald
watercress sauce and a sumptuous duck confit. Never fussy or overwrought,
his French cooking embodies a graceful Japanese aesthetic. Bistro 21, 846
N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 967-0021. Entrees, $16 to $27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [THE BUFFALO CLUB] is an odd, maddening place. Lost in an industrial
part of Santa Monica, with no sign outside, it has only a valet station
to mark the spot. As you'd expect, it has plenty of attitude. Inside is a
sophisticated supper club with luxurious leather chairs, generous booths
and a magical garden with Chinese lanterns strung overhead. The surprise
is the excellent American menu from one of L.A.'s best French-trained
chefs, Patrick Healy. Try the spicy buffalo wings, the classic crab cakes
and, in season, juicy soft-shell crabs. Don't forget the ethereal
cornmeal-crusted okra or the fries. The Buffalo Club, 1520 Olympic Blvd.,
Santa Monica; (310) 450-8600. Entrees, $25 to $32.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At [CAFE BLANC], chef/owner Tommy Harase turns out polished
French-Japanese cooking worthy of a much grander space than this
nine-table cafe. As stark and design-conscious as a museum restaurant,
Cafe Blanc focuses on the food: lobster bisque, poussin with
rosemary-lime juice. Lunch is more casual, and quite a bargain for the
level of the cooking. Cafe Blanc, 9777 Little Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly
Hills; (310) 888-0108. Entrees, $18 to $24.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Williamson became sous chef at Michael's when she was only 20.
Now 23, she's the chef at [ZAX] in Brentwood, the neighborhood where she
grew up. Her menu is "contemporary American," based on what she finds at
the farmers market. Composed salads and soups are wonderful. She's strong
on seafood, but don't miss the New York steak topped with Roquefort
butter, which brings one customer back so often, she's named the dish
after him. Zax, 11604 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood; (310) 571-3800.
Entrees, $18 to $27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The menu at [CHINOIS ON MAIN] barely budges, and regulars tend to
ignore the specials in favor of classics such as the baby back ribs in a
dark, sticky sauce redolent of star anise, the rich Shanghai lobster
embellished with flash-fried spinach, or the meaty Mongolian lamb chops
with cilantro sauce. Wolfgang Puck's foray into Franco-Asian cooking is a
fusion that has dazzled for 19 years. Waiters are clad in black Chinese
pajamas. And Barbara Lazaroff's high-spirited decor makes it feel like a
party you've been lucky enough to crash. Chinois on Main, 2709 Main St.,
Santa Monica; (310) 392-9025. Entrees, $25 to $36.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [GINZA SUSHI-KO] is L.A.'s most expensive restaurant--a cool $300 per
person (when fugu, or blowfish, is in season, it can run even more), and
that's without drinking a drop. At such prices, sushi master and potter
Masa Takayama can afford to be uncompromising. He flies his seafood in
from Japan and cooks only by reservation, usually for no more than 10
people. It's a meal that demands attention: You'll eat things you may
never have seen before, such as raw sweet shrimp marinated with shrimp
brain and liver. Yet there's nothing pretentious about this understated
restaurant. Perfection is almost impossible, but Takayama somehow
achieves it. Ginza Sushi-Ko, 218 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills; (310)
247-8939. $300 per person and up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Wolfgang Puck opened a second [SPAGO] in 1997, the idea of moving
from West Hollywood to staid Beverly Hills seemed a mistake. But he has
proved everyone wrong and has created an even better Spago, more fine
dining than California casual. Much of this success is thanks to Lee
Hefter, a rare chef who can both command the troops at this enormously
busy restaurant yet constantly challenge the kitchen with inventive new
dishes. Spago is still the place to see and be seen, but now more than
ever people come for the food and the extensive wine list. Spago, 176 N.
Canon Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 385-0880. Entrees, $22 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At lunch, Hollywood power brokers slip into the booths at [THE
GRILL]--a classy retro joint famous for its definitive Cobb salad, a
perfect Caesar and chophouse favorites such as double-cut lamb chops,
prime New York strip and liver and bacon. Ingredients are top-notch, and
the service from the white-jacketed waiters is the best in town. With The
Grill's classic martini, it's the kind of place Nick and Nora from the
"Thin Man" films would have loved. The Grill, 9560 Dayton Way, Beverly
Hills; (310) 276-0615. Entrees, $20 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A coolly elegant Swedish restaurant seems an unlikely tenant for a
glitzy shopping mall, but that's Orange County. After 13 years, [GUSTAF
ANDERS] is alone in presenting contemporary Scandinavian cuisine. Chef
Ulf Anders bakes all his own Swedish-style breads and cures his own
herring, grav lox and sugar-and-salt-cured salmon. They're fabulous. In
season, you can order platters of crayfish cooked with handfuls of dill,
or shrimp in the shell. His desserts are irresistible, especially the
Princess cake wrapped in a sheet of pale green marzipan. Gustaf Anders,
3851 S. Bear St., Santa Ana; (714) 668-1737. Entrees, $18 to $20.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though Joachim Splichal sold his restaurant empire to Restaurant
Associates two years ago, he's still in charge at his flagship
restaurant, [PATINA], whose reputation as one of the Southland's finest
French restaurants carries all the Pinots in its wake. The cooking is
perhaps best expressed in the tasting menus--and in the magnificent cote
de boeuf served table-side. This year Splichal added a glassed-in chef's
table in the kitchen for as many as six guests, where you can order wines
hand-picked by sommelier Chris Meeske. Patina, 5955 Melrose Ave., Los
Angeles; (323) 467-1108. Entrees, $29 to $31. Chef's tasting menus, $65
to $75. Chef's table, food only, $100.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Josie Le Balch grew up in her father's French restaurant in the San
Fernando Valley. Now, after stints at Saddle Peak Lodge and Remi, this
second-generation chef is behind the stoves every night at her own Santa
Monica restaurant, [JOSIE]. She can make a mean sauce, and first courses
run from the classic (mushrooms in puff pastry or a cherry tomato
tartlet) to gutsy (grilled cuttlefish with chorizo). Every night, she
dreams up a handful of specials, many of them based on game. Josie, 2424
Pico Blvd., Santa Monica; (310) 581-9888. Entrees, $18 to $31.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Everyone I've ever taken to [LAKE SPRING SHANGHAI] in Monterey Park
has gone back on their own. That's saying something when there are
hundreds of Chinese restaurants competing for attention. This small
restaurant features the cooking of Shanghai, with wonderful
Shanghai-style dumplings, sheets of tofu braised to resemble goose, and a
slew of other appetizers. The piece de resistance is pork "pump"--a pork
leg cooked slowly in Chinese plum sauce until it's so tender the waiter
can cut through it with a spoon. Lake Spring Shanghai, 219 E. Garvey
Ave., Monterey Park; (626) 280-3571. Entrees, $10.</TE>
<TE>   The long-running [campanile] counts legions of foodies among its fans.
Owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton celebrate bounty from the farmers
market and local producers with an appetizing seasonal menu. First
courses offer fresh sardines, fava bean puree, little packets of stuffed
pasta or a benchmark Bibb lettuce salad showered with herbs. The cheese
selection is glorious and the desserts are dreamy, which means you have
to save room, somehow, for both. Campanile, 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los
Angeles; (323) 938-1447. Entrees, $25 to $40.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [LUCQUES] is a delight for its good looks, gracious staff and, most of
all, for Suzanne Goin's sensual French-Mediterranean cooking. The
single-page menu is filled with enticing offerings such as fava bean and
ricotta ravioli with mint, escarole and black olives, and fat spears of
asparagus topped with a fried egg and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Braised short
ribs in a horseradish cream are menu regulars. Order the suckling pig if
you see it, or any of the beautifully modulated fish dishes. Cheeses are
always a point, and desserts are delicious. Lucques, 8474 Melrose Ave.,
West Hollywood; (323) 655-6277. Entrees, $20 to $32.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Josiah Citrin emerges from the kitchen of [MELISSE] after a night
behind the stoves, he looks as if he's just run a marathon. He has, in a
way. Citrin is pouring everything he's got into this ambitious 3-year-old
French restaurant. The decor is a bit old-fashioned, but that makes it
all the more French. The same goes for the format, which offers a formal
meal, with everything from amuses gueules to desserts and petits fours.
Several of the best dishes, such as the splendid cote de boeuf for two,
are served table-side, and the chef's tasting menu is always a treat.
Melisse, 1104 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica; (310) 395-0881. Entrees, $28
to $36. Chef's tasting menu, $68.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A custom-tailored cottage on Balboa Peninsula is home to [AUBERGINE],
where Tim Goodell and his staff are cooking some of the most interesting
food in Southern California. Goodell's unique take on contemporary French
cuisine, highlighted with Asian touches, becomes more refined with every
menu. I love his poached foie gras in a French canning jar, his artistry
with seafood and his delights with pork or rabbit. Desserts from pastry
chef Shelly Register are both inventive and delicious. Aubergine, 508
29th St., Newport Beach; (949) 723-4150. Prix fixe menus, $39 to $105.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that Jean-Pierre Bosc is sole owner of [MIMOSA], he's spending
more time in the kitchen and has pulled this French bistro out of a
slump. Francophiles crowd in for thin-crusted tarte flambee, pretty beet
salads, stuffed mussels and friture d'Eperlans (tiny whole fried fish)
with a lemony tartar sauce. He's also cooking soulful dishes such as
tablier de sapeur (braised tripe) and other regional French dishes. For
dessert, there's that childhood favorite: meringue floating in a sea of
custard. Mimosa, 8009 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (323) 655-8895.
Entrees, $15 to $24.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [JOE'S] is one of the most reliable restaurants in town because Joe
Miller is in the kitchen almost every night, sending out his signature
mushroom ravioli, composed salads, interesting soups and
California-French-inspired main courses. His slow-cooked salmon is
sublime, as is an earthy duck confit. For dessert, try a pot de creme or
a lavender-scented creme brulee. The place is packed every night, but the
toughest reservation may be Sunday brunch. Joe's Restaurant, 1023 Abbot
Kinney Blvd., Venice; (310) 399-5811. Entrees, $19 to $24. Prix fixe
menus, $38 and $48.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At [MORI SUSHI], sushi master Morihiro Onodera likes to keep a low
profile. The inconspicuous sign is all the better for his fans, because
they can still get in. Sushi quality is remarkable, and Onodera  is such
a fanatic for detail that he hulls his own rice to ensure it retains all
its moisture. This is one of the few places where you'll get your money's
worth when ordering omakase. Mori Sushi, 11500 Pico Blvd., West Los
Angeles; (310) 479-3939. Sushi, about $40 to $60 per person. Omakase
starts at $65.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Gabriel Valley boasts more Cantonese-style seafood houses than
possibly anywhere else in the country, and [NYC JUMBO SEAFOOD] is right
at the top. To see what's being offered, head straight to the wall of
fish tanks at the back filled with crab, rock fish, geoduck clams,
lobsters and live prawns. Keep it simple: steamed prawns, whole fish
steamed with ginger and scallions. Try the giant New Zealand king crabs
cooked three ways: steamed with glass noodles and prawns, deep-fried
plain and fried with rice, heaped in the upturned shell. NYC Jumbo
Seafood, 203 W. Valley Blvd., Alhambra; (626) 289-4828. Entrees, $9 to
$13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [PINOT BISTRO], the first--and most reliable--of Splichal's many
Patina spinoffs, is a Valley institution, thronged both at lunch and
dinner. The black-and-white floor, classic bistro chairs and graceful
writing on the mirror dress the part. You'll eat very well if you stick
with the salads, soup du jour, the crispy whitefish and any of the
braised meats or chops. Most regulars wouldn't think of leaving without
dessert--make it the croissant bread pudding drowned in cream or a plate
of sugar cookies. Pinot Bistro, 12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; (818)
990-0500. Entrees, $18 to $25.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [JIRAFFE] may be the ideal Santa Monica restaurant. Irreverent and
fun, its logo is the Eiffel Tower morphing into a giraffe. The food from
home-grown surfer-chef Raphael Lunetta is an amiable mix of California
and country-style French. He does wonderful things with foie gras, wild
mushrooms and salads. He's especially strong on seafood, which, sad to
say, is unusual this close to the coast. JiRaffe, 502 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Santa Monica; (310) 917-6671. Entrees, $19 to $30.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The decor at [RESTAURANT DEVON] in Monrovia may be a bit hard-edged
(Chinese chairs, copper-tubing light fixtures, abstract paintings), but
chef Pedro Simental's precise California-French cooking makes up for it.
Dainty crab cakes bursting with crab, grilled quail stuffed with lamb
mousse, or the mixed mushroom salad perfumed with walnut oil and walnuts
make a strong first impression. His skill as a saucier shows up in
poussin in a refreshing orange glaze or steak in a Port reduction as
transparent as a watercolor wash. Restaurant Devon, 109 E. Lemon Ave.,
Monrovia; (626) 305-0013. Entrees, $14 to $28.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At [IL RISTORANTE DI GIORGIO BALDI], a casual Italian with a
star-studded clientele, the cherubic Signor Baldi cooks the food of his
childhood: a smooth brown puree of borlotti beans festooned with
fettuccine, tiny sweet clams and fat white beans, spaghetti in an
understated tomato sauce and eggy fresh fettuccine in a musky porcini
sauce. The prices are somewhat high for what is basically trattoria fare.
I guess you have to pay extra for the tang of the sea half a block away.
Il Ristorante di Giorgio Baldi, 114 W. Channel Road, Santa Monica; (310)
573-1660. Entrees, $12 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After 12 years, Hans Rockenwagner continues to reinvent his Santa
Monica restaurant, [ROCKENWAGNER]. Though German-born, he's a California
chef to the core, playing off Asian, French and more exotic elements to
create a cuisine as personal and eclectic as his Edgemar Complex setting.
Spring brings a white asparagus festival. Last year he and wife Patti
added WunderBAR, where you can order small plates (including a beguiling
pretzel burger) and taste cutting-edge German and Austrian wines by the
glass. Rockenwagner, 2435 Main St., Santa Monica; (310) 399-6504.
Entrees, $21 to $27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pasta stars at [POSTO], the Valley cousin to Piero Selvaggio's
Valentino in Santa Monica. Chef Stephen Samson, after all, grew up on his
mother's Bolognese cooking and pays tribute to her with dishes such as
paglia e fieno (green and yellow noodles with peas, prosciutto and cream)
and hand-rolled garganelli. You can't go wrong with osso buco or any of
the other Italian classics on the menu either. Posto, 14928 Ventura
Blvd., Sherman Oaks; (818) 784-4400. Pasta, $14 to $16. Entrees, $19 to
$27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leave the city behind at [SADDLE PEAK LODGE]--a stone and timber
hunting lodge in Malibu Canyon. With Patina veteran Warren Schwartz in
the kitchen, the food is better than ever. The theme is the same--mostly
game--but, oh, what a difference. His deft hand with sauces and inspired
combinations of flavors allows the taste of elk, buffalo and venison to
shine. This is the place to drink those big, bold Cabernets and Rhones in
front of the huge stone fireplace--as long as you don't mind the moose
and deer heads staring down from on high. Saddle Peak Lodge, 419 Cold
Canyon Road, Calabasas; (818) 222-3888. Entrees, $28 to $36.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italian restaurants in Los Angeles tend to be generically Tuscan
because that's the one region everybody knows. But in Pasadena,
[TRATTORIA TRE VENEZIE] swims against the tide. Unusual pastas, a veal
bollito misto, fish in agrodolce and seductive desserts that go beyond
the usual tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake are among the creative
offerings. The wine list is almost as eclectic as the menu, strong on
wines from Friuli, Veneto and Alto Adige--which form Italy's Tre Venezie
region. Trattoria Tre Venezie, 119 W. Green St., Pasadena; (626)
795-4455. Entrees, $22 to $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [VINCENTI'S] new chef, Nicola Mastronardi, is cooking gutsy, delicious
food--from tender octopus salad perfumed with lemon, grilled seppioline
with beans or lentils to wonderful pastas, such as bucatini all'
amatriciana, any of which would do Vincenti's namesake, Mauro Vincenti,
proud. Whole fish cooked in the wood-burning rotisserie is worth
mentioning, as is the pigeon with peperonata and baby onions, just the
dish for a Brunello di Montalcino or a Barolo or Barbaresco with some age
on it. However, unless you have very deep pockets, wine prices are
prohibitive. Vincenti, 11930 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood; (310)
207-0127. Entrees, $12 to $38.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [TROQUET], the French bistro from Aubergine's Tim Goodell, might be
more at home on Paris' Left Bank than in the South Coast Plaza shopping
center, but quelle chance! This saucy bistro is just the place to repair
after a bout of shopping. Start with dainty oysters on the half shell,
silken foie gras or a pretty little salad, followed by a wonderful piece
of fish, some braised beef cheeks in a deep-flavored wine sauce or a
glorious roast chicken for two. Troquet, 3333 Bristol St., Suite 3001,
Costa Mesa; (714) 708-6865. Entrees, $15 to $22.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wine lovers rush to [VALENTINO] the minute they hit town for a wine
list that sets the blood racing. Owner Piero Selvaggio ferrets out
bottles from inventive producers and estates from Italy and the world
over. Tell the sommelier what you're drinking, and chef Angelo Auriana
will create a menu around that bottle of Barbaresco or Brunello.
Appetizers, pastas and risottos are both elegant and soulful. Instead of
a dessert, explore the Italian cheeses, or a luscious vin santo or
recioto dessert wine. Valentino, 3115 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica; (310)
829-4313. Entrees, $19 to $35. Menu extravaganza, $85.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not often that a truly interesting chef comes up through the
hotel system, but [THE GRILL] at the Ritz-Carlton Huntington has one in
Craig Strong. He worked in Barcelona before coming to Southern California
and weaves elements of Provencal and Catalan cooking into his menu at the
grand old Pasadena hotel. Past offerings have included crayfish served
with fideus (broken pasta cooked like risotto) and a bouillabaisse sauce,
a chilled eggplant and tomato terrine garnished with a silky brandade,
and a seared foie gras set off with a vanilla sauce and Asian pears.
Strong is an accomplished pastry chef as well. Let's hope he stays. The
Grill, Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel &amp; Spa, 1401 S. Oak Knoll Ave.,
Pasadena; (626) 577-2867. Entrees, $35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unique in its concept, [YUJEAN KANG'S] eponymous restaurant reflects
his interests in historical and regional Chinese recipes and techniques.
But Kang's real passion is for wine. At his Pasadena restaurant, you can
match his Chinese "polenta" and shrimp with Rieslings and Gewurztraminers
from Alsace and Germany. The best, though, is to ask Kang to cook a menu
for the entire table. Just don't forget the miniature dumplings in chile
oil. Yujean Kang's, 67 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena; (626) 585-0855.
Entrees, $12 to $20.</TE>

<LD>The hip and the healthy pack into [AMMO], where sleek tables and
concrete floors provide a backdrop for stylish comfort food. Summer
dinners include spaghetti with Japanese baby eggplant with a fresh
mozzarella and roasted tomato sauce and a salad of red endive, frisee and
mache. But the most irresistible offering is available only at weekend
brunch: freshly squeezed juice made from Granny Smith apples, lemons and
ginger. Dinner entrees start at $14. Fresh-squeezed juice, $4. Ammo, 1155
N. Highland Ave., Los Angeles; (323) 871-2666.--H.J.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Changing seasonally, the compact menu at [BRITTA'S] may rove from
pasta to pot roast, circle back to warm goat cheese and then head home
with duck confit. Eclectic, yes, but the baseline is the best of
fundamental American culinary values updated with international
influences. Entrees start at $11. Britta's, 4237 Campus Drive, Irvine;
(949) 509-1211.--M.B.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to get sidetracked by the exotic grills and Peruvian criollo
dishes at [CEVICHE DEL REY]. The restaurant boasts seven ceviches, the
best of which is the zingy, clean-tasting tiradito, an elegant version
that's almost a sashimi. Halibut is sliced to near translucence and
lightly marinated in lime. Tiradito, $13. Ceviche del Rey, 7404 Florence
Ave., Downey; (562) 806-4033.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The specialties at [NU-Y] are the Vietnamese eight-course fish
dinners, which are more a tapas spread than a glutton's feast. Dainty
fresh and fried fish spring rolls arrive with dipping sauces and the
familiar herb-lettuce-rice paper-noodle quartet. Diners can roll or swish
as their pleasure dictates while devouring the marvelous fish salad,
assorted leaf-wrapped grills and tamarind-drenched fish fingers. Fish
dinners, $14 per person. Nu-y, 10830 Warner Ave., Fountain Valley; (714)
963-1700.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you're looking for authentic home-style Greek cooking, the
venerable and family-run [CHRISTAKIS] is the place. The piece de
resistance is the rack of lamb ($29). Marinated in white wine and
oregano, it's tender and juicy and almost enough for two. For dessert, be
sure to have the galactobouriko--clove-infused custard baked in a sheath
of filo dough. Entrees start at $8. Christakis, 13011 Newport Ave.,
Tustin; (714) 731-1179.--M.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Great flame-broiled, Mexican-style chicken is the stock in trade at
[CHARO CHICKEN], where the crew slathers beautifully blackened pieces
with a thick lemon garlic butter sauce. Sides--particularly whole pinto
beans a la olla and adroitly seasoned Spanish rice--are impeccable. Half
chicken with two sides, $8. Charo Chicken. Eleven locations, including
the original at 333 Main St., Seal Beach; (562) 594-0909.--M.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For 16 years, owner Suk Kyong Kim has coddled Korean customers at
[CHIN GO GAE]. Her tender black goat is the prescription. Infused with
vibrant red pepper and masses of garlic, it's either grilled table-side
or simmered in deeply flavored bubbling broth. Great handfuls of
brilliant fresh greens follow the meat into the pot, and every bite is
paradise. $26 for two. Chin Go Gae, 3036 W. 8th St., Koreatown; (213)
480-8071.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [CLEMENTINE] serves unusually sophisticated salads and sandwiches.
Classics such as salmon with creme fra'che, egg salad with watercress or
turkey and sprouts on wheat are particularly good. And save room for
owner Annie Miller's desserts, especially the oatmeal-raisin cookies and
Moravian sugar bread. Salads and sandwiches, $5 to $10. Clementine, 1751
Ensley Ave., Los Angeles; (310) 552-1080.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who knew? There's a crepe cult in Japan, and now it's here. [CREPE IN
THE GRIP] serves wrap-style crepes with fillings ranging from teriyaki to
ham and cheese to sundae-like fruit and ice cream mixtures, all presented
in a bright, youthful atmosphere. Entree crepes, $4. Crepe in the Grip,
715 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel; (626) 282-5265.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enter [SASOUN BAKERY] and the warm, comforting aroma of bread
overtakes you. In the morning, choose from the sweeter breads, such as
tahineh and the small cornet-shaped date choereg. As the day progresses,
offerings turn from sweet to savory with breads such as lemon-flavored
spinach or the paper-thin lahmajoon spread with a layer of finely ground
spicy lamb. Breads, about $1. Sasoun Bakery, 5114 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood; (323) 661-1868.--J.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With its wild tiki bar and jungle vibe, [DAMON'S STEAKHOUSE] is as
retro-Polynesian as an aloha shirt. Go for the petit filet steak lunch,
which includes a salad with the restaurant's famous creamy orange
dressing, and a choice of fries, rice or tomatoes. Try it with a Damon's
mai tai. Petit filet steak lunch, $10, mai tai, $5. Damon's Steakhouse,
317 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale; (818) 507-1510.--B.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You can't go wrong at the postage-stamp-sized [DEERFIELD KITCHEN]. The
$4 lunch menu includes bacon with garlic shoots--a pile of sauteed
vegetables shot through with thin brown slices of the smokiest pork
around. Only here will you find the addictive jing do rou bing, a fried
flatbread stuffed with a layer of fine, fatty minced pork. Jing do rou
bing, $4. Deerfield Kitchen, 130 S. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; (626)
284-3867.--M.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tourists flocking to Hollywood &amp; Highland may be looking for movie
memorabilia, but at [CAFE MOZART OF EUROPE] they'll find a dream of old
Vienna. The cafe serves a remarkable frankfurter sandwich, not to mention
rich Viennese pastries and elaborate European coffee and ice cream
creations. Sandwiches, $5 to $7. Cakes and sundaes, $4 to $8. Cafe Mozart
of Europe, Hollywood &amp; Highland, 6801 Hollywood Blvd., Suite 321,
Hollywood; (323) 957-9580.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colombians flock to the modern minimalist [RESTAURANTE CAFE COLOMBIA]
for patacones --tostada-like constructions of garlic-infused smashed
green plantain. The disks get double deep-fried to a shattering
crunchiness, mounded high with sour orange-infused chicken (or your
choice of grilled beef or unctuous pork chicharron) and showered with
delicious Colombian coleslaw. Patacones, $8. Restaurante Cafe Colombia,
222 S. Glenoaks Blvd., Burbank; (818) 558-3985.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Part grocery, part delicatessen, [EL METATE] is a spacious, airy place
with a casual dining area where you can nurse a cold beer and munch on
your choice of hearty pork, beef, chili, chicken or vegetarian tamales.
The meat versions come doused in a piquant mole sauce. A local
institution for 32 years. Tamales, $2, or $15 per dozen. El Metate, 838
E. 1st St., Santa Ana; (714) 542-3913.--M.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [GYU-KAKU] is the first American outpost of a chain of fast- food
restaurants that's second only to McDonald's in popularity in Japan. The
Japanese-style Korean barbecue features a young, hip setting, cool jazz
on the stereo and table grills where patrons cook seafood, marinated beef
and organic chicken over charcoal. Don't miss bibimbap--rice, kimchi and
greens in a sizzling stone pot. Appetizers, $1 to $5. Other dishes, $5 to
$8. Gyu-kaku, 10925 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 234-8641.--S.I.V.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For some of the best fries in town, head for [FATHER'S OFFICE]. Served
with garlic parsley aioli, the fries arrive "a la cart"--that is, in a
paper bag nestled in a miniature metal shopping cart. Roasted garlic and
Cabrales blue cheese aioli season the sweet potato version. Wash them
down with a pint of Tetley's ale--the freshest you'll taste outside of
Yorkshire. Fries, $5. Father's Office, 1018 Montana Ave., Santa Monica;
(310) 393-2337.--H.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the [GOLDEN DELI], hidden away in a San Gabriel strip mall, there's
always wait to eat the fabulous Vietnamese fare. Once you've tried the
shrimp paste--served on sugar cane and wrapped tightly in rice paper with
romaine, bean sprouts, carrots, mint, cilantro and Asian herbs-- you'll
be hooked. Dishes from $3 to $7. Golden Deli, 815 W. Las Tunas Drive, San
Gabriel; (626) 308-0803.--J.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You'll leave Southern California far behind when you enter [JAY
BHARAT'S] rose-colored dining room, where Indian families nosh on
pettis--a crisp fried pastry filled with coconut, raisins, nuts and
potatoes--and sip orange mango lassis. Regulars order up okra curry,
dhosas and stuffed puri and other Southern Indian vegetarian specialties.
Appetizers, $1 to $3. Entrees, $4 to $7. Jay Bharat, 18701 Pioneer Blvd.,
Artesia; (562) 924-3310.--J.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [LANGANO], the Valley's only Ethiopian restaurant, has the usual spicy
stews (wats) and kitfo, a rich dish of ground beef mixed with butter and
cardamom. Of special interest is the range of vegetarian dishes such as
ye-shiro wat, ground yellow split peas mixed with a buttery, garlicky red
sauce. Ye-shiro wat, $5. Langano, 14838 Burbank Blvd., Sherman Oaks;
(818) 786-2670.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A glass-enclosed waterfall splashes near the entryway of [BANYAN
RESTAURANT], where a beautifully stylized rijsttafel--the Indo-Dutch
rice-centered feast--tempts both the eye and appetite. Served on a
ceramic banana leaf, the long parade of curries with meticulously cut and
arranged accompaniments are presented in the restrained manner of a
Japanese bento. Rijsttafel, $16. Banyan Restaurant, 1140 Highland Ave.,
Manhattan Beach; (310) 545-9558.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Step into [MADAME MATISSE] and you're transported to those lovely
Parisian or Roman neighborhood storefronts. Here, you can't go wrong with
a beet, apple, Gorgonzola and candied-walnut salad or a perfectly cooked
steak au poivre with a mean green peppercorn sauce served with a
bubbling, creamy potato au gratin. Entrees start at $10. Madame Matisse,
3536 W. Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake; (323) 662-4862.--J.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The barbecue is wet and sloppy at [PECOS BILL'S PIT B-B-Q], and that's
the way the regulars like it at this 56-year-old neighborhood 'cue shack.
On weekends, there are good pork ribs that sell out fast; as the sign
says, it's open till 3 p.m. "or till the meat runs out." Sandwiches, $4.
Spare ribs, $12 a pound. Pecos Bill's Pit B-B-Q, 1551 Victory Blvd.,
Glendale; (818) 241-2750.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every part of the cow, the pig and (on weekends) lamb, too, is served
at [RINCON TAURINO], but the biggest seller is the beefy carne asada.
Have a couple of asada tacos topped with onions and hot chipotle sauce
and sliced radishes on the side. Carne asada taco, $1. Rincon Taurino.
Several locations, including 14551 Nordhoff St., Panorama City; (818)

<TE>   You'll be hard-pressed to find a better Italian-style treatment of
seafood in Orange County than at [SCAMPI TRATTORIA] in Costa Mesa.
Whether tossed with pasta or simmered in risotto, the shrimp, calamari
and scallops all emerge magnificently plump, succulent and juicy. Pastas,
$8 to $14. Entrees start at $13. Scampi Trattoria, 1576 Newport Blvd.,
Costa Mesa; (949) 645-8560.--M.B.</TE>

<TE>   Get out your handkerchiefs when you approach [CHUNG KING
RESTAURANT]--a repository of fiery Sichuan cuisine. The highlight of the
108-item menu is No. 9: dried beef slices fried with Sichuan hot peppers.
It's a pile of crispy shingles of meat penetrated with rich, devilish
flavors. Try the mouthwatering Sichuan dumplings, doused in a red-tinted
ultra-spicy broth. Dinner for two, $23 to $39. Chung King Restaurant, 206
S. Garfield Ave., Monterey Park; (626) 280-7430.--M.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the smoke curls from the charcoal braziers at each table, guests at
[SOOT BULL JEEP] take turns grilling beef, pork, baby octopus and short
ribs--on or off the bone. Wrap up your barbecue in a lettuce leaf with a
smear of fermented bean paste and some pickled daikon or kimchi.
Barbecue, $15 to $20 per person. Soot Bull Jeep, 3136 8th St., Los
Angeles; (213) 387-3865.--S.I.V.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [SOUL FOLKS] takes some finding. Two blocks east of Alameda Street,
the cafe's entrance is in Bloom's General Store. The cozy,
incense-perfumed den serves up terrific soul food with some interesting
twists (e.g., barbecue tofu as well as hot links). The hamburger
overflows the bun, and you might have to cut it in three or four pieces
to eat it. Main dishes, $5 to $10. Soul Folks, 714 Traction Ave., Los
Angeles; (213) 613-0381.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Thai cooking. Some shining examples include kai yang--spice-encrusted

To accompany these dishes, try the fine-grained sticky rice served in a

Broadway, Long Beach; (562) 439-1564.--M.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [SUNNIN] is famous for its delicate fried kibbeh (most cooks make this
Lebanese bulgur-lamb meatball with a thicker crust) and elegant baklava.
But you ought to try the chicken shawarma--it has a good roasted chicken
flavor and a dash of sweet spices. Chicken shawarma sandwich, $6. Sunnin
Lebanese Cafe, 1779 Westwood Blvd., West Los Angeles; (310) 477-
2358.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a budget but hungry for homestyle Mexican cooking? You'll want to
stop at [TAMALES LILIANA'S], where the chilaquiles--sliced tortillas that
are fried, then smothered in green sauce--or the unusual Zacatecas-style
peanut mole draw a crowd. Their fluffy and moist tamales are also divine.
Mexican dishes, $2 to $6. Tamales Liliana's, 4619 Cesar E. Chavez Ave.,
Los Angeles; (323) 780-0989.--B.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a steak dinner at bear market prices, slip into a red Naugahyde
booth at [TAYLOR'S STEAKHOUSE]. The waitresses are sassy, and the hefty

glove--are precisely cooked. At lunch you can order burgers freshly
ground from the steak trimmings. Steak dinners start at $15. Taylor's
Steakhouse, 3361 W. 8th St., Koreatown; (213) 382-8449. Also 901 Foothill

Third, 8350 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles; (323) 655-2285.--S.I.V.</TE>

<TE>   There's only one thing on the menu at [TIGEORGES' CHICKEN]: moist,
very smoky chicken cooked Haitian-style on avocado and citrus woods. It
comes with rice, beans, salad and a mysterious, fairly hot sauce. Other
attractions include the restaurant's jovial proprietor and a soundtrack
of irresistible Haitian music. Quarter chicken, $5. TiGeorges' Chicken,
309 N. Glendale Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 353-9994.--C.P.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [TOAD HOUSE] is a Korean restaurant specializing in pork dishes. Pork
skins are colorfully presented with red bell pepper, onions, mushrooms
and chiles in a spicy-sweet red sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds. The
pork skin? It's in there too, boiled until virtually fat free, then cut
into strips that are as light and chewy as al dente pasta. Pork skin,
$13. Toad House, 4503 W. Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (323)
460-7037.--B.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   [UNCLE DARROW'S CAJUN CREOLE EATERY] may not look like much, but wait
until you taste the food at this boxy corner stand. The red beans and
rice are spicy and fabulous, and the jambalaya is unforgettable. Stop by
on Fridays and Saturdays when they serve up file gumbo and "The Big
Easy," a combination of fried catfish, shrimp and oysters. Cajun and
Creole dishes, $6 to $15. Uncle Darrow's Cajun Creole Eatery, 5301 W.

<TE>   Those who insist that the patio see-and-be-seen scene is the crux of
[URTH CAFE'S] popularity have clearly not tried the Spanish latte. Made
with condensed milk, potent house-roasted organic espresso and crowned
with foam in the shape of a heart, this sublime concoction will make you
an addict. Spanish latte, $4. Urth Cafe, 8565 Melrose Ave., West
Hollywood; (310) 659-0628.--H.J.</TE>

nuggets of fresh white cheese and wispy piles of deep-fried spinach and
olives for an untraditional garnish. Cordero a la miel, $17. Viva
Madrid!, 225 Yale Ave., Claremont; (909) 624-5500.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like many excellent South Indian cooks, the kitchen staff at
[WOODLANDS] has high culinary ambitions for lowly beans and grains.
Magically, they transform them into spice-scented griddle cakes, fragile
fritters and yard-long dosai with exotic fillings. Showiest among the
breads is batura, a balloon-size sphere. Crack open its frail shell and
tear a swatch to scoop up curries sprinkled with freshly made coconut
chutney. Dinner for two, about $28. Woodlands, 11833 Artesia Blvd.,
Artesia; (562) 860-6500.--L.B.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At [YAKITORI-YA], order almost any part of the chicken you can name to

<HD>Fusion: The California Birthright</HD>
<DH>Far From Being a Modern Fad, Our Obsession With Fresh Food and
Ethnic Cuisine Goes Back for Generations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>Russ Parsons is a columnist in The Times' Food section</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WE ARE THE FOODIES OF THE NEW FRONTIER. WE WILL GO ANYWHERE and eat
anything. We have rejected the stodgy foods of our fathers and embraced a
lifestyle of gustatory hedonism. We are Californians, the originators of
fusion food and the seekers of every oddball fruit or vegetable on the
planet.</LD>
<LD>   Don't you just want to slap us sometimes?</LD>
<LD>   If you read the papers, you'd think the current generation of
Californians is the first to shop at a farmers market, visit an ethnic
restaurant or follow a bit of improvisation while cooking. Not to put a
damper on today's food lovers--childlike enthusiasm is such a wonderful
thing--but it's important to give credit where it's due. Some of your
parents and even grandparents were foodies long before you slurped your
first hand-thrown Chinese noodle.</LD>
<TE>   An appreciation for the good things in life--or at least those parts
of it that are edible--seems to be a birthright for every Californian.
Far from a modern fad, the roots of our food obsession can be found
almost as far back as you care to look. The 1905 "Los Angeles Times Cook
Book No. 2," which featured recipes from prominent turn-of-the-century
Angelenos, included an entire chapter of "Old-Time California, Spanish
and Mexican Dishes." Sunset magazine, that bible of the California
lifestyle, was running recipes for pit-baking meat wrapped in banana
leaves back in the 1930s. And what would you call Trader Vic's but an
early outpost of fusion cuisine?</TE>
<TE>   Even in the postwar era--a time we now think of as belonging strictly
to Ozzie and Harriet, bland suburbs and white bread suppers--there was an
enthusiastic embracing of the kitchen arts. Consider the evidence left
behind by Genevieve Callahan and Helen Evans Brown, both cookbook writers
and Californians--the former if not by birth, then certainly by
avocation.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan was born in Iowa in 1897. After attending Iowa State, an
early-century hotbed of home economics, she became one of the first
editors at Better Homes and Gardens, based in Des Moines (it had just
changed its name from Fruit, Garden and Home). She came west in 1928 when
Sunset publisher Larry Lane lured her and co-editor Lou Richardson to
help run his newly purchased magazine. After putting out the first of
several Sunset cookbooks, Callahan published her own, "The California
Cook Book," in 1946. It was intended, she wrote, to provide "not only the
recipes of the region, but also the way of living and entertaining that
is typical of California, the background and traditions of California
hospitality and the recipes and menus that our various foreign groups
have contributed to the California dining table."</TE>
<TE>   At a time that we now think of as belonging to the canned soup
casserole crowd, Callahan highlights cooking from a surprising number of
ethnic groups. You might expect Mexican, Chinese, Italian and French
(yes, in the '40s, French was an ethnic cuisine). But there are Armenian,
Danish, Filipino, Indian and Syrian recipes as well. It is a collection
as diverse and chatty and definitively Californian as any William Saroyan
novel.</TE>
<TE>   Her recipe for Syrian stuffed eggplant, Callahan wrote, came from "a
friendly Western Union operator who liked the sound of a recipe I was
describing in a wire to Good Housekeeping and who offered this one in
exchange for a copy of mine." Essentially eggplant stuffed with lamb,
pine nuts and goat cheese, it sounds remarkably like something that might
have been served at the old City restaurant on La Brea when it was in its
boundary-busting prime.</TE>
<TE>   Brown cast her net even wider--and deeper. A native Pasadenan born in
1904, she is somewhat better known today than Callahan, largely because
of her long friendship with James Beard. They wrote "The Complete Book of
Outdoor Cookery" together in 1955 and some of their correspondence from
that period was collected in the 1994 book "Love and Kisses and a Halo of
Truffles."</TE>
<TE>   "Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book," published in 1952, is one of the
classic American regional cookbooks. The recipes are well-chosen, but
more than that, it is gracefully written, well-researched and opinionated
in all the right places--even though she didn't seem to have the same
familiar ease with cooks from different ethnic groups as Callahan had.
Her tendency to write things such as, "Japanese food has never attained
the popularity that has Chinese, but there are many of their dishes that
we like tremendously," is somewhat jarring after Callahan, who always
seemed to write as if she were sharing recipes with a next-door neighbor.
But Brown's knowledge of diverse cuisines and her sense of taste are
undeniably deeper.</TE>
<TE>   While Callahan was the cook down the street passing recipes over the
back fence, Brown was the studious type who spent her time dining at
obscure restaurants and delving into old cookbooks (she and husband
Phillip Brown were also important antiquarian book dealers, and "West
Coast Cook Book" concludes with a five-page bibliography).</TE>
<TE>   In describing bunuelos (Mexican fritters), she quoted from an early
California historical account: "Women sent them to friends at Christmas
time and often, for a joke, would fill them with cotton wool." Of a
chicken and watercress soup, she wrote: "Quite obviously Chinese and
quite obviously good only if the stock is rich with chicken." Granted,
most of Brown and Callahan's recipes aren't what we would demand today
from an ethnic cookbook. Chinese recipes tended to be dishes such as egg
foo young, chop suey and sweet-and-sour spareribs; Mexican fare was
guacamole and chiles rellenos.</TE>
<TE>   But compare these two works to cookbooks of the same period from
anyplace else in the country, and that seems like a nitpick. The openness
is more important than the authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   The interest in what their neighbors were cooking was not the only
place these authors were ahead of the curve. On close reading, both books
reveal a wealth of raw ingredients that would make today's cooks envious.
If California is now a food lover's paradise, it must have been an
absolute heaven in the '40s and '50s. There are recipes for vegetables
that are sometimes difficult to find even at our best farmers markets:
salsify, purple-red Venetian cauliflower and fresh cranberry beans.
Fruits include exotica such as cherimoyas, feijoas, loquats and various
types of guavas, while even the more common are enjoyed with lip-smacking
relish.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the persimmon, perhaps the archetypal California fall fruit:
"I purchase [them] when they are hard so that I can enjoy their full
beauty before they reach the eating stage," Brown wrote. "I arrange them
lovingly in a huge shallow bowl and give them a place of honor on the
dining table. I watch them change their color, soften, reach that degree
of transparency and utter ripeness at which they are at their very best.
And then, when they've become of more than passing interest to the fruit
flies, I throw them, ever so reluctantly, into the garbage can."</TE>
<TE>   Fruits and vegetables are just the beginning. The books also present
the full range of California's seafood--from rock cod to sand dabs,
halibut and salmon, as well as assorted crabs, shrimp and clams. ("In
shellfish, as in some other features--temperatures, altitudes, and
redwood trees, for example--California rather runs to extremes," Callahan
wrote.) There's even a prescient elegy for the abalone. Commenting on new
laws prohibiting out-of-state shipment of the tasty gastropod, Brown
wrote in 1952: "[They're] designed to keep these delectable shellfish
from going the way of the great auk. We weren't always so smart." Among
the recipes is one from a Los Angeles restaurant called Paul's Duck
Press: abalone stuffed with lobster tail, shrimp and crab meat bound with
a cream sauce.</TE>
<TE>   California was apparently a cornucopia of game as well, and not
today's farm-raised stuff, either. Under "Game" in Callahan's index,
there's the note "See also Duck, Goose, Pheasant, Quail, Rabbit,
Venison." But it's Brown who really went all out. She covered
preparations for everything from elk and wild boar to wild turkey and
sage hen: "Delicate if it's cleaned the minute it's shot; otherwise the
flavor of sage becomes so unbearably strong that it tastes as if it has
been cooked by an herbiculturist."</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia is a trap laid for the willing, especially here in
California and especially when it comes to food. We must be careful not
to romanticize a time that most of us can't know except by hearsay. At
the same time, one of the pleasures of reading old books is the way they
allow us to see our own time more clearly. And in this case, that means
being reminded not only of what we've gained but also of what we have
lost.</TE>

1880s, and is typical. It says, 'Use two pounds of beef ribs or mutton. A

<TE>   NOTE: Two other Mexican dishes, olla podrida and sancocho, were also
popular with the early Californians. The former, named after the olla, or
clay pot in which it was cooked, was a wondrous stew of meats and
vegetables, with as many variations as an Irish stew. It was made of beef
or mutton, sometimes poultry and game, chickpeas or beans, and
vegetables, and usually had some chorizo added. The sancocho was also of
meat, and had potatoes, corn, and other vegetables included. It was
probably just another olla podrida.</TE>

<TE>   BUNUELOS</TE>
<TE>   MAKES 6 to 8</TE>
<TE>   Brown says there are many kinds. "One is a crisp little rosette, light
as a rose petal that is made on an iron resembling a Swedish timbale
iron. Another, also deep-fried, is a puffy bit of nothing, often served
with a cinnamon-flavored syrup, or with honey for dessert. This same
fritter, without the syrup, makes a spectacular and utterly delicious hot
bread, a sort of Mexican popover." It is important when cooking these
fritters to pat them with a spatula so they keep submerged in the hot oil
 and puff the way they should.</TE>
<TE>   11/2  cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2   teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   11/2  teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1     quart oil</TE>
<TE>   1     egg</TE>
<TE>         water</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sift flour with salt and baking powder. Work oil into the mixture,
make a hole in the middle and drop in the egg. Mix well and add enough
water to make a stiff dough. Roll very thin and cut in diamonds or
squares, or roll the dough in balls and pat out thin with the palms of
the hands. Fry in oil at 400 degrees, submerging bunuelos and releasing
to encourage puffing. The bunuelos will puff up and become crisp. Serve
hot for breakfast or lunch. These are sometimes called sopaipillas.</TE>

<TE>   Recipes adapted from "The California Cook Book," by Genevieve
Callahan, (M. Barrows &amp; Co., New York, 1946)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SYRIAN STUFFED EGGPLANT</TE>
<TE>   SERVES 6 to 8</TE>
<TE>   This is the recipe that Callahan got from the friendly Western Union
operator. It is a surprisingly authentic and complex dish for the time.
Before boiling the whole eggplant, remove the calyx (the green cap).</TE>
<TE>   3/4   pound lamb shoulder, cut in small cubes</TE>
<TE>   4     tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2   cup uncooked rice</TE>
<TE>   1     large eggplant (or 2 small ones)</TE>
<TE>   1     clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1     small onion, minced</TE>
<TE>   2     tablespoons diced green pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4   cup pine nuts</TE>
<TE>   1     roma tomato, peeled and diced</TE>
<TE>   salt, celery salt and pepper</TE>
<TE>   a tiny sprinkle of cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 - 1/2 cup red table wine</TE>
<TE>   1     cup crumbled goat cheese or 1/2 cup grated parmesan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brown lamb slowly in olive oil in a heavy skillet. (If uncooked meat
is used, cover after browning and let it braise until tender.) Meanwhile,
boil the rice tender and set aside about 15 minutes. Parboil the whole
eggplant for 15 minutes in boiling salted water. Then cut eggplant in
half lengthwise and hollow out, leaving a shell about 1/4-inch thick. Set
aside the removed part.</TE>
<TE>   When the meat is well browned and tender, add garlic, onion and green
pepper. Braise until almost brown. Add rice. Then add pine nuts, tomato
and eggplant. Season to taste with salt, celery salt, pepper and a
sprinkle of cinnamon. Stir in red wine to make a loose mixture. Fill
eggplant shells with mixture, spread cheese over the top and bake in an
uncovered 8-inch-square baking pan at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes.
Slide under broiler to brown the top lightly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHINATOWN SPARERIBS</TE>
<TE>   SERVES 4</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This recipe from Callahan could be a poster child for mid-century
Western misconceptions about Asian cooking. Still, everyone who tried it
in our Test Kitchen liked it, albeit in a somewhat apologetic way.
Callahan notes that the ribs should be cut into 2-inch lengths.</TE>
<TE>   2    pounds spareribs</TE>
<TE>   1    tablespoon peanut oil or pork fat</TE>
<TE>   2    tablespoons brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   2    tablespoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1/2  teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4  cup apple cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/4  cup cold water</TE>
<TE>   1    cup pineapple juice (drained from 20-ounce can of pineapple
chunks in juice)</TE>
<TE>   1    tablespoon soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1    bouillon cube</TE>
<TE>   1/4  cup boiling water</TE>
<TE>   1/4  cup diced onions</TE>
<TE>   3/4  cup canned pineapple chunks</TE>
<TE>   3/4  cup diced carrot</TE>
<TE>   3/4  cup diced green pepper</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Separate ribs, place in boiling salted water and simmer 1 hour,
covered, or until tender. Drain. Brown ribs slowly in oil. Mix sugar,
cornstarch and salt. Stir in vinegar, cold water, pineapple juice and soy
sauce. Add bouillon cube dissolved in boiling water. Add this mixture to
ribs and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is translucent. Add
onion, pineapple, carrot and green pepper. Cover and cook until
vegetables are tender but still crisp. Serve with rice or fried noodles.</TE>

<DH>A Handful of Renegade Winemakers Are Producing Syrahs and Viogniers
and Other French Varietals That Just May Put Paso Robles on the
International Map</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD>Heather John is a senior Style editor at the magazine</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NARROW COUNTRY ROADS SNAKE INTO THE WESTERN HILLS OF PASO ROBLES.
Native oaks dripping with moss, fields of cattle, chalky soil, weathered
barns and lupine-lined vineyards define this yet undiscovered, rugged
wine region. But, unlike California wine landscapes in the Napa Valley,
Santa Barbara or Sonoma, the scenery--much like its new breed of
winemakers--does not lend itself to comparison. It's not Napa. It's not
Bordeaux. It's not Tuscany. Paso Robles is its own terroir--distinctly
raw and distinctly Californian.</LD>
<LD>   To understand terroir--what the French define as the total natural
environment that imparts defining characteristics to wines from a
specific viticultural site--is to understand Paso Robles' emerging
identity as a premier area for producing Rhone-style wines. The most
common of these red varietals are Syrah (Shiraz, as it's known in
Australia), Mourvedre and Grenache. White varieties include Viognier,
Roussanne and Marsanne. For the past several decades, Paso Robles (or
Paso, as the locals call it) has been known for its mass-produced, and
often inferior, wines from the appellation's warmer eastern vineyards.
But the cooler and rockier vineyards of the region's west side resemble
the southern Rhone in France both in climate and soil. A handful of Rhone
devotees want to change the area's wine-making image, and foreign
producers are taking notice.</LD>
<TE>   You might not expect much as you step through the door of winemaker
Mat Garretson's humble aluminum-clad warehouse in an industrial park off
Highway 46 East. To the left of the tasting bar, there's a shelf of
T-shirts that bear the winery's label, Garretson Wine Co., along with the
slogan "Well, we've never heard of you either." Garretson emerges from
the cellar and says with a laugh, "Pretension is not part of my
vocabulary." The 40-year-old vintner, known in wine circles as "Mr.
Viognier," is one of the region's most enthusiastic proponents of Rhone
varietals--a passion that predates his arrival on the Paso scene. As the
owner of a wine store in Atlanta, he founded the Viognier Guild in 1992,
which later became known as the Hospice du Rhone--an annual event now
centered in Paso that draws some 160 producers and 4,000 wine lovers from
around the globe each May.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Garretson moved to California to work as director of sales
and marketing at Eberle Winery, a producer of high-end Cabernet
Sauvignon. Gary Eberle, while at Estrella River Winery, was one of the
area's first vintners to experiment with a Syrah varietal, in 1978. "Gary
Eberle knew my passion for Rhone wines, and he was open to exploring that
avenue," he says. "By the time I left we were doing eight Rhone-style
wines."</TE>
<TE>   Garretson then found similar sensibilities at Wild Horse Winery, where
he went to work with Ken Volk, forming the Equus label in 2000 to produce
Viognier, Syrah, Roussane, Grenache and Mourvedre. For the last six years
he also made wine under his own label at friends' facilities. Last year
he left Wild Horse to start his own winery, devoted exclusively to Rhone
varietals. He's currently producing 4,500 cases, most notably Viogniers,
which have landed on the wine lists at such high-profile Los Angeles
restaurants as Lucques, Campanile, Alex, Rockenwagner and Asia de Cuba.
"The growth has been dramatic and continues to be," Garretson says.
"People within the wine industry recognize that this isn't just a fad,
and it's something Paso does very well."</TE>
<TE>   Others are following suit. Today, 43 wineries are making Syrah and 23
are producing Viognier in the Paso Robles appellation. Of the 21 Rhone
varieties, 12 are currently planted in the region. And while these
plantings still cumulatively amount to less than 20% of Paso Robles fruit
(the majority is still Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel
respectively), acreage being planted with Syrah specifically is
escalating faster than any other single variety--both in Paso Robles and
throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   "Syrah delivers what Merlot promised," says Bob Lindquist, owner and
winemaker of Santa Barbara County's Qupe Wine Cellars. Lindquist has been
making Syrah from Paso Robles fruit under the Qupe label since 1982.
While others were stuck in the Merlot frenzy of the '90s, Lindquist saw
the region's potential for Rhone-style wines. "Merlot was supposed to be
the softer, fruitier version of Cabernet that was more approachable, and
many Merlots didn't turn out to be that way, but Syrah really is. It's a
big, rich wine that can go with the same foods that Cabernet does, but
you don't have to age it forever to get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Manfred Krankl, owner of Sine Qua Non winery in Santa Barbara County
and Campanile's founding partner, also recognized the compatibility of
Paso's Rhone-style wines with California cuisine. He was one of the first
Los Angeles restaurateurs to feature Rhone blends in the late '80s on
Campanile's wine list when others weren't yet ready to take the gamble.
Krankl says, "I never felt like I was taking a risk putting those wines
on the list. There were times when I had more Viogniers on our wine list
than Chardonnays. Viognier goes particularly well with spicier and more
flavorful foods. As for reds, Syrah and Grenache lend themselves to foods
that are relatively hearty. It was just one of those things that if
someone showed me a good wine, I couldn't care less where it came from.
And there's no question that [Paso Robles] has terrific potential to be a
wine-growing area that's as recognizable as Napa or Sonoma."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it all comes back to terroir. A great wine begins in the
vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   John Alban, a vintner in the neighboring Edna Valley and co-founder of
Hospice du Rhone, was the first to plant both Viognier and Roussanne in
California. "About 17 years ago I really started to look at where in
California we could grow outstanding Rhone varieties. Paso Robles
interested me because of the climate," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Like the southern Rhone, Paso's hillsides are rich with loamy,
calcium-rich soil. Located six miles from the coast halfway between Los
Angeles and San Francisco, the western region experiences cool marine
breezes, which are pulled inland during the afternoon, creating daytime
temperatures that fluctuate by as much as 40 to 50 degrees. Warm days
shift into cool evenings, giving the grapes more complexity by extending
the growing season (the cooler the region, the longer the hang-time on
the vines, and the more intense the grape's flavor). Due to high pH
levels in the soils, the west side's wines are also notable for their
intense color. Whites are rich and golden; reds tend to be vibrant and
jewel-toned. Simply put: Rhone varieties thrive under these conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the early '80s, few premium vintners beyond Eberle or Lindquist
recognized the region was well-suited to these grapes. "You had a
combination of a very depressed wine market in the early '80s, and also
just no recognition for these varieties at all. So it was tough at first
to find anyone to consider getting involved in growing them. I talked
people into letting me graft over their vines [with Rhone clones] and
farm them, and then I paid something for the fruit when it came into
production," Alban says. "I look back on it now and it worked out very
well, but it has the effect on me like when you look back on a car crash
and start shaking. I have the benefit of hindsight and seeing that it
worked, but I still ask myself 'What was I thinking?' I propagated and
planted 32 acres of Viognier at a time when there were roughly 50 acres
of Viognier in the world. That really is lunacy."</TE>
<TE>   But from madness comes genius, as the work of renegade winemaker
Stephan Asseo illustrates. Four years ago, the 42-year-old Paris native
moved to Paso Robles to make Bordeaux-Rhone varietal blends after
producing16 vintages in Bordeaux. "When you leave Bordeaux to go to the
New World in a wine region that is not established--that is not
Napa--people think you're a little bit crazy. People asked, 'Why would
you buy a regular car when you are already driving a Ferrari?' " he says.
But for Asseo, the move was anything but a downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to blend [Bordeaux varietals] with others, such as
Syrah, because I knew the results would be fantastic," he says. "But you
cannot do that in Bordeaux under the appellation controllee. I wanted to
make something new that was big, but elegant."</TE>
<TE>   The result is L'Aventure Optimus--the 1999 vintage was a blend of 52%
Syrah, 44% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Zinfandel. (The 2000 and 2001
vintages will also include Petit Verdot.) There's no question that it's
uncoventional, but one taste will tell you the risk paid off. Dark cherry
and plum flavors with spicy oak tones that don't overpower make this one
of the more intriguing Rhone blends coming out of this region.</TE>
<TE>   Though Asseo's approach to blending is decidely New World, his take on
planting is rooted in tradition. He believes the region's success
ultimately lies in making complex, blended wines using fruit from more
densely planted vineyards--a European viticultural model that is being
increasingly adopted in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   But therein lies the challenge. What is the right model for Paso's
vineyards? Justin Smith, who is producing Syrah from his family's James
Berry vineyard, agrees that finding the right equation has been an
obstacle for many vintners. Winemaking is a strange alchemy of soil and
climate, varieties and skill. "Paso is a unique site, and it's hard to
look to other regions as an example because Paso is still so young, and
viticulturally, we're having to learn as we go along." Smith's father
bought the 55-acre property (which has grown to 75 acres) 22 years ago
and began farming grapes, first experimenting with Chardonnay and Pinot
Blanc and later planting Syrah.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years ago, we definitely couldn't have made this quality of
wine," Smith says. "It took that 20 years of experimenting and figuring
out exactly what does work in these soils and how to plant the vines, and
that's been our biggest obstacle. You can't look to France to see what
works because we have a California climate, and you can't look to Napa
because it has fertile valley soils." Smith's 350-case production of 2000
Saxum "Bone Rock" Syrah, is concentrated, lush and velvety. It's a
complex wine that couldn't have come from a large-tract vineyard, where
quantity is paramount. "You can't make a good wine from bad grapes, and
I'm very focused on the vineyard," he adds. "That's where I make my
wines. I like to think there's a chalkiness that comes from the rocky
soils."</TE>
<TE>   And it's these soils that led the Perrin family, owners of the famed
Chateauneuf-du-Pape estate Chateau de Beaucastel, to establish their New
World venture, Tablas Creek Vineyard in Paso Robles. In the mid-'80s,
Jean-Pierre Perrin teamed up with veteran East Coast wine importer Robert
Haas to search for a California property. "We were looking for high
alkaline soils, like those in the southern Rhone," says Haas. "We liked
the climate of Paso Robles' west side; it was pure chalk. And we said,
'OK, this is where we plant the flag.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1989 they purchased a 120-acre parcel (which has been expanded to
150 acres) and began importing vine cuttings from Beaucastel's southern
Rhone estate in 1990. Due to "indexing" (the process that ensures vines
meet USDA standards), the vines were quarantined at a holding station in
Geneva, N.Y., for three years. But sacrificing quality for cost was not
an option. "We were founding our whole enterprise on vines," Haas says.</TE>
<TE>   Today the winery vinifies Mourvedre, Grenache Noir, Syrah, Counouise,
Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc from these transplants
and produces 6,000 cases of both single-varietal and blended wines--a
number they hope to increase to 23,000 cases by 2008. In the meantime,
Tablas Creek has constructed three greenhouses in which they nurture
their imported French cuttings, and, due to increasing interest from
other vintners, sell to neighboring properties wishing to cultivate Rhone
varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Beaucastel, whose place in Rhone history dates back to the 1600s, is
not the only international heavy-hitter to realize Paso's potential. The
Australian powerhouse Southcorp Wines (Penfolds' parent) teamed with the
Central Coast's Niven family to produce a Paso Robles-designated Shiraz
under their Seven Peaks label. Likewise, Napa's Turley Wine Cellars, a
producer of sought-after cult Zinfandels, has moved in. Two years ago,
Turley bought the historic Pesenti Winery with the idea of producing more
Zinfandel, a variety that also thrives in the region. But once Turley
arrived, it decided to expand its portfolio to include Rhone varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Turley winemaker Ehren Jordan, who apprenticed in northern Rhone
cellars, says, "In a lot of ways Zinfandel and Rhone wines are a lot
alike because they're both fruit-driven flavorful wines. When we bought
Pesenti, there was a small block of Grenache that was planted in the
'40s, so we vinified it separately and said, 'Wow, that's really good.' I
should say I wasn't totally surprised by that because I've had so many
other Paso Rhones that were really good. But we liked the Grenache so
well that we've torn out seven acres of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot,
which is not part of what Turley does, and replanted four acres to
Grenache and three acres to Zinfandel."</TE>
<TE>   Turley now sells The White Coat--a white Rhone blend of Marsanne,
Viognier and Roussanne--in its Paso Robles tasting room. It's also been
buying Syrah and Mourvedre, from which Jordan hopes to produce a red
Rhone blend in the next few years. Similarly, though Paso's own Justin
Vineyards &amp; Winery is known for its Bordeaux-style blends, winemaker and
vice president of production Jeff Branco, whose Bordeaux-style 1997
Isosceles was named one of the top 10 wines in the world by the Wine
Spectator, has been experimenting with Rhone varietals since '98. He has
produced 4,000 cases of three Rhone-style blends from the 2000 vintage,
which will be released later this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The big names are getting the attention, but ultimately it's the small
productions that keep the momentum going. Some of Paso's better Rhones
are produced in case lots of less than 2,000, including Justin Smith's
Saxum "Bone Rock" Syrah, Matt Trevisan's Linne Calodo 2000 "LC Red" Rhone
blend, Ken Winchester's Winchester Vineyards Syrah and "Cuvee Voisin"
blend, and Jeff Pipes' Pipestone Vineyards Rhone blends. It's these
risk-takers and their commitment to quality that will secure Paso Robles
a place in serious wine vernacular.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definitely a lot of Don Quixotes out there jumping at
windmills, and those are the people who succeed," says Garretson. "I
don't think we'll be the next Napa Valley in terms of tourism and
population because we don't have San Francisco in our backyard to fuel
that. But long term, we'll get our recognition."</TE>
<TE>   Paso Robles has proven it's ready for its close-up. And the demand for
Syrah--"the next Merlot"--in the national market may get Paso the
attention Garretson and his fellow Rhone renegades are hoping for.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lagging in Health-Care Delivery</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since none of the actual health-care providers are getting any of the
increases and, in fact, are often being reimbursed at a lower rate
for their services, one wonders where the money from the escalating
premium is going ["Health Insurance Rate Hikes Expected," June 18].</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps a clue may come from the more than 40% rise in profit
during the first quarter of this year alone reported by WellPoint
Health Networks Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Yet insurers seem to have as much social responsibility in
rendering more people uninsured by jacking up their premium as the
former Enron executives in decimating their employees' retirement
assets.</LD>
<TE>   It will take a major step if we want to prevent this crisis from
becoming a health-care 9/11. Only by returning the responsibility for
health-care choices to the individual can we ever hope to control
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of having employers shouldering most of the cost for
health care, Congress should consider passing laws to allow all
health-care expenditure after the first $1,000 to be tax deductible
for those who earn more than twice the poverty income level and to
provide a maximum of $5,000 annually in tax credit for those whose
income falls below this threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Our current system is unwieldy, unfair and inefficient. It is
unwieldy because it is too complicated and costly. It is unfair
because it forces the insured to subsidize the health care of the
rising pool of uninsured. It is inefficient because every health
dollar must pass through several hands and melts away faster than the
proverbial ice cube.</TE>
<TE>   We may be the world leader in health-care innovation and
technology, but we shall forever remain a world lagger in health-care
delivery if we don't do something drastically different soon.</TE>

with a major oil company and I have always been proud of Chevron USA

about CEOs who would deliberately victimize the very employees who
put that person in the position he enjoys.</LD>
<LD>   What in the world has happened to the mores and/or morals of
America's business leaders? Is the competition too much? Is their
individual ambition so great that they will do virtually anything to
amass great personal wealth? What is wrong with the stockholders when
they don't put the brakes on questionable actions and policies that
are proposed?</LD>
<TE>   The very thing that made this country the greatest one in the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My wife and I would like to buy a house in the next 12
months and have about $1,000 extra a month to either save for a down
payment or pay off our existing debt. The houses we're looking at are
roughly in the $175,000 range and we have about $11,500 saved
already. We also have about $35,000 in student loans, car loans and
credit card debt. We could put a real dent in the debt with this
money, but I also feel that if we save for a down payment, our
interest rate and monthly payments would be lower. What's your
suggestion?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You're right on all counts, and what you should do depends
a lot on the specifics of your situation.</LD>
<LD>   Your savings now equal about 6% of your target home price. If you
saved an additional $12,000, says mortgage expert Allen Bond, that
would boost you well above the 10% mark. If you can make a down
payment of at least 10%, you usually qualify for either a smaller
private mortgage insurance payment or a lower rate if you're doing
what's known as a piggyback loan--a regular 80% mortgage plus another
loan for the additional 10%, says Bond, president of the California
Assn. of Mortgage Brokers' Southern California chapter.</LD>
<TE>   Private mortgage insurance, if you don't already know, usually is
required by lenders when the borrower's down payment is less than 20%
of the purchase price. Costs for the insurance vary, but it's usually
$30 to $80 a month. You can avoid PMI by using a piggyback loan,
although the interest rate on the second, smaller mortgage may be
higher than the one on your first mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   You may, however, be carrying so much debt that it's negatively
affecting your credit score--which could increase your borrowing
costs. You didn't give a breakdown of your debts, but if most of it
is credit cards and car loans, rather than student loans, your score
could be suffering. In that case, it makes sense to pay off the
credit cards, at least, before adding to your down payment.</TE>
<TE>   You can find out your credit score, and what's influencing it, by
visiting www.myfico.com. For $12.95, you can view your credit report,
your three-digit score and an explanation of the positive and
negative factors affecting your score. You also can see, on the
site's home page, how different scores alter the mortgage rates you
can expect. Recently, the mortgage chart showed that someone with a
score above 720 could expect a rate of 6.75%, while a score of 675
would move the rate up to 7.41%.</TE>
<TE>   The site has a calculator to show how much you could save on a
mortgage by boosting your credit score. You may discover the savings
are so minor that you'll get more bang for your buck by saving money
for the down payment, rather than using it to pay off debt. Or you
may discover that a big jump in your credit score would be worth
having a smaller down payment.</TE>
<TE>   The site also has a simulator that allows you to "play" with your
score. In other words, you can see how paying down your various debts
might help your rating. (You also can see how far you can drive your
score down with late payments, maxing out your credit cards, opening
new credit accounts or declaring bankruptcy.)</TE>
<TE>   Once you've done this homework, you'd be smart to find a good
mortgage broker to discuss strategy, help you crunch all the numbers
and get you pre-qualified for a loan. Good luck!</TE>
<TE>   Cashing In Bonds to Pay Off Debt</TE>
<TE>   Q: Recently we checked the value of our savings bonds and learned
they are worth about $14,500, minus applicable taxes. We have an
outstanding balance of about $13,000 on our credit cards, with an
interest rate of 10.5%. We are thinking of cashing in the bonds to
pay off the debt, and putting what we had been paying toward the
cards into our savings instead. Is this a good move? If so, how shall
we invest the money that's freed up when we pay off the debt?</TE>
<TE>   A: Your plan gets a gold star. It almost never makes sense to keep
money in low-yielding savings or non-retirement investment accounts
when you're carrying credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Once the debt is paid off, however, don't rest on your laurels.
It's easy to slip back into a lifestyle where you charge too much and
can't pay off your credit cards each month. Consider investing some
of your savings in a community college class on budgeting and money
management. If you prefer do-it-yourself study, you'll find plenty of
good books on the same topics, including Eric Tyson's "Personal
Finance for Dummies." Personal finance software, such as Intuit's
Quicken 2002 and Microsoft's Money 2002, can help you organize and
track your finances.</TE>
<TE>   What you should do after that depends on your situation. If you
don't have an emergency fund equal to three to six months' expenses
tucked away in a money market fund, that's a good first goal. Once
that's taken care of, see whether you can invest a little more in
your employer's 401(k) plan or contribute to a Roth IRA. After you've
maximized your retirement savings, you can consider other goals, such
as saving for a new car or a long-desired vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Investing is all about setting goals, making choices and matching
your investments to your time horizon. In other words, money you may
need within a few years--such as an emergency fund--should be kept in
liquid accounts such as a money market. Money you won't need for 10
years or more, such as your retirement funds, can be invested in the
stock market. Once you've set your goals for this extra cash, you'll
be better able to determine how to invest it.</TE>

<HD>Competition, Slumping Sales Cloud Oracle's Outlook</HD>
<DH>Technology: Analysts say the software giant has alienated
some of its customers with aggressive tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When it came time last week for Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry
Ellison to address investors and analysts on the software giant's
quarterly conference call, he didn't talk about why the company had
just reported its first drop in annual sales since he founded it 25
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Ellison's brief speech didn't cover the company's grim projections
of more falling sales over the next six months, which were sending
Oracle shares down as he spoke, or even the just-concluded
legislative hearings in Sacramento into whether Oracle and a partner
firm had tried to influence state officials with donations coinciding
with the award of a massive no-bid contract assailed by auditors as
wasteful.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Ellison spent all his allotted minutes assaulting the
methodology of a 6-week-old Gartner Dataquest study that found IBM
Corp. had edged out Oracle as the No. 1 seller of database software.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Ellison really, really doesn't like being No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   That goes for his company's market share and its perennial
runner-up status behind Microsoft Corp. in sales by pure software
companies. And it goes for yacht racing, and weekend bike rides with
co-workers, one of whom swears that after Ellison fell behind on one
trip, he refused to go again until he had practiced enough to be sure
he would stay ahead.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not to mention Ellison's No. 5 spot on the Forbes list
of the wealthiest people (behind Microsoft founders Bill Gates and
Paul Allen).</TE>
<TE>   Now it appears that Ellison, 57, is either going to stay miserable
or learn a new way of dealing with the world.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle's stock has plunged from above $46 two years ago to a
multiyear low of $7.25 this month, closing Friday at $8.12 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company that Ellison owns a quarter of just posted a decline
in its annual operating income. And he is staring at a future
battling two bigger firms--IBM, which sells high-end databases
rivaling Oracle's, and Microsoft, which is quickly gaining ground
with cheaper systems.</TE>
<TE>   To a remarkable degree, Oracle's problems spring from Ellison's
unflagging desire to win at all costs, according to former employees,
customers and analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle declined to make Ellison or other executives available for
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   More Competition</TE>
<TE>   A fantastic salesman, Ellison created and led a corporate culture
that remains driven by the people who close the big deals. That
culture has gotten Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., in
trouble with regulators, and it has left many more customers than the
state of California feeling hustled.</TE>
<TE>   The difference now is that those customers can go somewhere else
when they need gear to house their data.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has become more competitive," said Gartner analyst
Betsy Burton. "IBM and Microsoft are offering a viable alternative,
and that has left the door open to companies to consider them because
they're sick of negotiating with Oracle."</TE>
<TE>   IBM, which sells databases that run on the biggest mainframe
computers, on mid-range Unix machines and on small Windows systems,
won 34.6% of the $8.8 billon spent on databases in 2001, up from
33.7% the year before, according to Gartner Dataquest.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's share grew to 16.3% from 14%, and Oracle slipped to
32% from 34.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle is telling investors it slowly will do better as the
economy starts to pick up and more big companies adopt its improving
suite of business software.</TE>
<TE>   And it's still far better to be an Oracle investor than a dot-com
or telecommunications investor--gross profit margins are a fat 75%
and have improved slightly in each of the last three years. The
company's operating profit, though down, still totaled a highly
respectable $3.6 billion in the fiscal year ended in May.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts don't see an easy way for profit to go up much when
sales keep going down.</TE>
<TE>   Customers cite many reasons for jilting Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle charges relatively high prices for its technologically
strong products that are harder to justify internally as companies
try to rein in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   As the overall growth in databases slows, Oracle has been pushing
applications that use the databases. But it runs up against niche
market leaders such as PeopleSoft Inc. in managing human resources
planning and Siebel Systems Inc. in managing relations with
customers.</TE>
<TE>   So many bugs riddled the first versions of Oracle's all-in-one
management system, called Oracle 11i, that many research firms
advised their clients not to adopt it. And because the applications
effort pits Oracle against firms that it allied with in the past,
some buyers feel safer with vendors that let them mix and match more
easily.</TE>
<TE>   "Oracle has really alienated the application vendors by directly
competing with them," said Janet Perna, IBM's general manager of data
management products. "When a customer is deploying a solution, it
might be an IBM database on a Sun Microsystems server with a Siebel
application. IBM's strategy has been to embrace the application
companies."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, IBM can afford to come off neutral--its most profitable
division is the one that tells companies how to integrate various
pieces of technology hardware and software.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to deciding which should be the lead provider, many
companies feel safer going with IBM. That's the reason Prasuna
Dornadula, chief technology officer of health-care service provider
CareTouch Inc., switched from Oracle to IBM databases.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to integrate all these things, and you need consulting
services for the integration," Dornadula said.</TE>
<TE>   IBM also can afford to undercut Oracle's prices.</TE>
<TE>   "IBM continues to bundle database licenses in with mainframe
maintenance renewals, services, hardware and just about anything else
it can throw in the pot," two Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a
report to investors this month. "It's a war of attrition funded by
IBM's other, healthier businesses."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has a similar war chest helping the sales of its SQL
server for Windows machines.</TE>
<TE>   An Issue of Trust</TE>
<TE>   Many other Oracle customers and ex-customers point to a much more
basic problem--the issue of trust.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of their pricing and licensing practices have tended to
overshadow their good technology," said Meta Group analyst Mark
Shainman. "It's imperative that Oracle not be looked at as the Evil
Empire and tries to be seen as more of a partner."</TE>
<TE>   In the California debacle, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and
others are looking into why a few government employees approved a
no-bid, $95-million state contract with Oracle, under a tight
deadline set by the company, at the same time that a $25,000 Oracle
donation was headed to Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The state auditor found that the contract could waste as much as
$41 million in taxpayer money, and four state employees and an Oracle
lobbyist have lost their jobs in the ensuing melee.</TE>
<TE>   Other public agencies have felt ripped-off as well. In Toronto,
public hearings will begin Monday on why the city bought 10,000
Oracle licenses through a third party, instead of 1,000 directly. The
city council asked a judge to investigate after determining that the
purchase was a "serious miscalculation" that might have lacked the
proper approvals.</TE>
<TE>   And in the wake of the California deal, other states and cities
and private companies are tightening rules designed to ensure
competitive bidding. The public sector is a major Oracle target,
providing more than 13% of the firm's $9.7-billion annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "California is making more organizations stop and think and go
through the due diligence," Shainman said. "They need to understand
the pricing models not only of Oracle but also the competition, and
then leverage the competition."</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento investigation is just the latest and
best-publicized event in a history of aggressive salesmanship that
dates to the company's earliest days.</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive Practices</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, the hard-sell approach championed by Ellison
made strategic sense.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison acknowledges that the company started by cribbing from
IBM's published guidelines for the first language for "relational"
databases.</TE>
<TE>   The system was a minor revolution, because it allowed people to
pull up data in unanticipated ways. Instead of a record distributor
just looking at one customer's history or its own sales by month, it
could look for what type of music sold best to heavy buyers in
midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   Although Oracle beat the slower-moving IBM out the door with the
first product based on IBM's research, it didn't have much of a head
start and had stronger competition from the beginning. Ellison
consistently made claims about Oracle products that he acknowledges
weren't true--or at least weren't true yet--and then pressed his
engineers to make good.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days we did not scrupulously make clear what was in
the design spec [specification for future versions] and the language
spec and what was actually in the current version of the product,"
Ellison was quoted as saying in a 1997 book, "The Difference between
God and Larry Ellison," by Mike Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Some early Oracle buyers lost their jobs because of the glitches,
which sometimes ate their companies' data.</TE>
<TE>   But the early market share gains gave Oracle momentum and eventual
dominance, reaffirming Ellison's belief in the importance of selling
hard.</TE>
<TE>   The mentality also extended into sales reporting, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Oracle in 1993 for
double-billing, sending invoices for work that wasn't performed and
booking sales that could be canceled later. Oracle settled the case
and paid the government $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing exaggerations have continued in recent years,
including Oracle's November claim that its 9i database was
"unbreakable" (it wasn't) and that it saved $1 billion by using its
own e-business suite (layoffs helped, too).</TE>
<TE>   And many customers say they felt more like prey than partners this
year, when Oracle told them it would recalculate what they owed under
one pricing plan and that it would stop providing technical support
for older software products earlier than the buyers had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Clients have told Gartner that some Oracle sales staff are
limiting customers' purchasing options by making them choose the
option that costs the most," Gartner Dataquest wrote in March.</TE>
<TE>   Other customers complained that Oracle representatives told them,
"Since we haven't heard from you [in new orders], we're going to
charge you more for maintenance or we're not going to support you,"
said Carol A. Parks, president of systems integrator Aureus Solutions
Inc. in Monrovia, Md.</TE>
<TE>   A Good No. 2</TE>
<TE>   Ellison is trying to improve things. The company no longer is at
war with the independent Oracle Applications Users Group, a
consortium of more than 2,000 firms that swap survival tips and lobby
Oracle for better service.</TE>
<TE>   And it is phasing out extra commissions for sales staffers who
close deals at the end of the fiscal year, a practice that led to
high-pressure wheeling and dealing.</TE>
<TE>   But the main thing that has kept Oracle in check over the years
has been a series of steady Ellison deputies, from Oracle co-founder
Bob Miner to Ray Lane, all of whom have left the company. Some have
founded competitors, and some haven't disguised their dismay at
Oracle's treatment of the people paying its bills.</TE>
<TE>   "The view of customers is 'screw 'em,' " aid Lane, now a venture
capitalist, said in March. "I'm embarrassed by it."</TE>
<TE>   With a CEO who not only relishes the sales razzle-dazzle but also
flies planes, races yachts through deadly storms and has broken his
neck body-surfing, Wall Street analysts say Oracle's lack of a good
top operating officer--and potential successor--is its biggest single
problem.</TE>
<TE>   But Ellison said after Lane left nearly two years ago that he
would never have such a strong backup again, and his low-profile
board hasn't pressed the issue.</TE>

<HD>For Markets, This Time Is Different--Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This time is different" was the mantra of the 1990s boom years for
the economy and the stock market. "Different" meant that, unlike
previous booms, the '90s version didn't have to end badly--or maybe
didn't have to end at all, according to many of the era's raving
optimists.</LD>
<LD>   Now, two years into the bust that wasn't supposed to be, "This
time is different" is an apt description of the current market
situation:</LD>
<LD>   * Despite plenty of signs that the U.S. economy is continuing to
rebound, the stock market, as measured by key indexes, is careening
toward new three-year lows. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slumped
1.8% last week, ending Friday at 989.14. The blue-chip S&amp;P is down
nearly 14% year to date, and is just 2.4% above the three-year
closing low of 965.80 reached on Sept. 21.</LD>
<TE>   That's a lot of numbers to make a simple point: The bear market
that began in March 2000 may still be large and in charge, even amid
an economic recovery. History says it isn't supposed to happen this
way.</TE>
<TE>   * History also says that lower interest rates are supposed to be
bullish for stocks. But the dive in long-term Treasury bond yields
over the last five weeks has been mirrored by five consecutive weekly
losses in equities.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has tumbled from
5.25% on May 17 to 4.77% as of Friday. In the same period the S&amp;P 500
has dropped nearly 11% and the Nasdaq composite has plummeted 17%.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve policymakers will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and
they are expected to keep their principal short-term interest rate at
1.75%, the 40-year low the central bank has maintained since
December. Despite the widespread view that the Fed may not raise
rates until 2003, many investors have continued to prefer the
near-zero returns on money market funds and bank deposits to taking a
chance on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   As the picture on Wall Street darkens, of course, investors ought
to be allowing for the possibility that a turnaround is near. That
would be the classic sequence: Just as the last potential buyer gives
up hope for higher stock prices, a rally ensues.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, that is, "This time is different."</TE>
<TE>   It can't be much comfort to most investors that stocks are on the
verge of recording the longest bear market since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   If the S&amp;P 500 and other major indexes break below their Sept. 21
lows, they will extend to 27 months the decline that began in March
2000. That would exceed the 21-month bear market of 1973-74, which
now stands as the longest since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in the S&amp;P 500 index, however, was 48% from the peak to
the trough in 1973-74. At Friday's close, the S&amp;P has given up 35% of
its value, so far, from its March 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   The decline has been far worse for the technology-dominated Nasdaq
composite, which at Friday's close of 1,440.96 was off 71% from its
record high in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street pros contend that the last bear market in fact
ended on Sept. 21, in the panicked selling that followed the
terrorist attacks. That gave way to a powerful fourth-quarter rally
that lifted the S&amp;P index as high as 1,172 by Jan. 4, a 21% gain from
the Sept. 21 low.</TE>
<TE>   If you subscribe to the idea that a 20% gain marks a new bull
market, then one was born in the fourth quarter--only to quickly
wither this year, at least as measured by the S&amp;P and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the new-bull-market idea point to the relative
strength in smaller stocks this year, and the hefty gains in many
non-tech stock sectors that had been out of favor in the late '90s,
such as home builders, gold miners and defense contractors. The bears
still may be having their way with the old market leaders (especially
tech), but it has indeed looked like a new bull market for a lot of
other stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook investment
newsletter in New York, argues that this year's decline in key
indexes "is a continuation of the same bear market," because the S&amp;P
500 failed to reach a new high in its post-attacks rally.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, labeling this market phase amounts to little more
than hair-splitting for investors who've simply held on to blue-chip
shares and technology names for the last two years, and now are
facing the strong possibility of a third straight calendar-year loss.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 hasn't fallen in three consecutive calendar years
since 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   The average mutual fund that owns big-name growth stocks is down
17.8% this year, after sliding 23.6% in 2001 and 14.1% in 2000,
according to Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Given the unprecedented gains recorded in blue-chip and tech
stocks in the late '90s, perhaps it shouldn't surprise anyone that
the hangover from the boom is so severe.</TE>
<TE>   The times were different in the late '90s: Never before had the
S&amp;P index posted a total return of more than 20% a year for five
consecutive years, as it did from 1995 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in March 2000, the stock market was widely viewed as
priced for a "perfect world"--one of unchallenged U.S. dominance,
rising prosperity and soaring orders for new technology, among other
things.</TE>
<TE>   Since that world has disappeared, investors have been struggling
to re-price equities for a decidedly imperfect future. Likewise,
global investors have of late been re-pricing the value of the dollar
relative to other currencies. As the dollar has sunk, so too has the
value of U.S. assets as foreigners perceive them.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, when investors find that stock values and the dollar's
value fairly reflect the current state of the U.S. economy and its
prospects for the next few years--meaning, the risks are balanced by
the potential returns--the downward re-pricing cycle will end,
setting the stage for a new advance.</TE>
<TE>   Some market pros believe we're just about there.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point soon I think the view will shift that we have
re-priced [for a new environment], and that the economy isn't going
down a black hole," said Scott Grannis, economist at Western Asset
Management in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dollar's sharp decline in recent weeks against the
euro in particular, Grannis argues that the greenback is merely
"correcting" after dramatic gains in the last few years. He notes
that at 97.1 cents on Friday, up from 89 cents at the start of this
year, the euro's value still is 17% below where it began life on Jan.
1, 1999, at $1.17.</TE>
<TE>   As for stocks, the decline in prices in recent weeks, while
Treasury bond yields have fallen simultaneously, should be making
equities much more appealing compared with bonds, Grannis said. "With
the decline in bond yields, stocks are becoming cheap," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If that's true, it should be even more so when comparing stocks
with money-market accounts and bank saving accounts yielding in the
1% range.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Yardeni, investment strategist at Prudential Financial in
New York, notes that the total of currency held by the public, plus
cash in short-term accounts such as money market funds and bank
savings deposits, reached $5.8 trillion in early June, up from about
$4.5 trillion at the start of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the uncertainties that hang over the market dissipate,
there's plenty of liquidity to fuel a rally in stocks," Yardeni said,
assuming the economy remains in recovery mode.</TE>
<TE>   But how cheap is cheap enough for stocks in this now-imperfect
world of diabolical terrorists, untrustworthy corporate accounting
and outrageous self-dealing by unscrupulous chief executives at their
shareholders' expense?</TE>
<TE>   Blue-chip stock price-to-earnings ratios have come down since
October, on average. But based on Standard &amp; Poor's estimate of S&amp;P
500 companies' earnings over the next 12 months, the S&amp;P index is
priced at 19 times earnings.</TE>
<TE>   By historical standards that is still expensive, many experts say.
They are countered by those who say a 19 P/E isn't high given low
inflation and low yields on competing income-producing investments.</TE>
<TE>   The potential problem with all market predictions is that they are
largely rooted in the historical experience. If "this time (continues
to be) different," history may be of little help. This market just
tends to make it up as it goes along.</TE>

<LD>Former and Current Rite Aid Execs Indicted</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury indicted four former and current executives
of the Rite Aid Corp. drugstore chain on charges of running a massive
accounting fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury alleged that Rite Aid's former chief executive,
Martin Grass, and other senior executives used bogus accounting
maneuvers to inflate the company's 1998 and 1999 earnings.</LD>
<TE>   When the accounting practices later were questioned, the company
made the biggest restatement of earnings in U.S. corporate history.</TE>
<TE>   The case was the latest in the recent spate of corporate
accounting revelations, which have spurred government regulators to
propose the creation of a new accounting oversight board that would
impose broad sanctions for wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee approved an accounting
industry reform bill that would limit the amount of consulting firms
could provide to companies they audit.</TE>

<TE>   Forecasters See Slow but Steady Recovery</TE>
<TE>   UCLA business forecasters predict sluggish economic growth for the
remainder of the year but see no evidence of a second recessionary
dip.</TE>
<TE>   Recent data showing flagging consumer confidence and a slowdown in
retail spending have heightened nervousness that the recovery will
falter.</TE>
<TE>   But the quarterly UCLA Anderson Forecast says that, barring some
unexpected shock, the U.S. and California economies should continue
their slow but steady rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a survey conducted by the Anderson Forecast showed
that many employers are expecting health insurance rate increases of
20% or more and are preparing to make substantial changes in health
plans to shift more of the burden of rising premiums to workers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the respondents said they were expecting health premiums
to jump by double-digit percentages in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, about 75% of the managers polled said they were
somewhat or very likely to substantially revise their companies'
health plans when annual renewals come up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Probing Memory Chip Manufacturers</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation
into whether semiconductor manufacturers manipulated prices in the
$11.2-billion memory chip market.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators issued subpoenas to Micron Technology Inc.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and Infineon Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. received a request from U.S.
regulators for information.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation comes as the memory chip business struggles with
weak demand for personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   The four companies control 80% of the global market for dynamic
random access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers and
other electronic devices.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that Micron and Samsung each have a 25% share of
the DRAM market, while Hynix has 20% and Infineon has about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials declined to answer questions about
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said they would cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IRS Can Estimate Tip Income, Justices Rule</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court dealt restaurant owners a tax defeat,
ruling that the Internal Revenue Service can use an estimate of tips
received by servers and bartenders when determining tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-3 ruling upholds a move by federal tax collectors to force
employers to pay the 7.65% Social Security tax on all income,
including tips, received by their workers.</TE>
<TE>   The decision could help the IRS collect more taxes from tipped
employees, if it results in restaurants requiring employees to more
accurately report their tip incomes. Employees typically underreport
such income to their employers.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant industry said the ruling could push struggling
operators into insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   But others painted a much less grim scenario. Richard Martin,
managing editor of Nation's Restaurant News, said the new method for
calculating employees' taxable income would add only pennies to the
cost of a typical meal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nonsmoker Wins Damages in Suit</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry suffered two significant defeats, including
its first in a secondhand-smoke case when a Miami jury awarded $5.5
million to a flight attendant who claimed she suffered sinus
inflammation from working in smoky airplane cabins.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the award was particularly striking because sinusitis
is not a life-threatening illness and attorneys for plaintiff Lynn
French, 56, had sought only $1 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The award was intended as compensation for past and future pain
and suffering, and French's fear of getting cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said they would
ask Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Fredricka G. Smith to set aside the
verdict. Failing that, they would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case, a U.S. District Court judge in Kansas City,
Kan., set a $15-million punitive damages award against R.J. Reynolds
in a case brought by a sick smoker of the company's cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   The damages were in addition to $200,000 in compensatory damages
awarded by the jury in February.</TE>
<TE>   The company called the punitive damages excessive.</TE>

<TE>   XO Seeks Protection From Creditors</TE>
<TE>   XO Communications Inc., a debt-laden telephone and Internet
service provider founded by mobile phone pioneer Craig McCaw, added
its name to the carnage in the telecom industry by filing for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The Reston, Va., company, which financiers Carl Icahn and Theodore
J. Forstmann briefly haggled over this year, said it will try to
complete a pending $800-million deal made in January with Forstmann's
company and Telefonos de Mexico. The offer will expire Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   If it can't complete the deal, the company said, it will go with
its backup plan to raise $250 million, initially from shareholders,
and remain a stand-alone operation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reports Detail Payments by Global Crossing</TE>
<TE>   In the months before filing for bankruptcy protection, Global
Crossing Ltd. shelled out millions of dollars in cash to executives,
consultants and companies with ties to Global Crossing officers.</TE>
<TE>   The payments are included in the financial statements that list
bills, salaries, severance, expense reimbursements and other items
paid in 2001 by Global Crossing Ltd. and subsidiary Global Crossing
Development Co.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   The financial reports, part of the company's Bankruptcy Court
proceedings, are of interest to Global Crossing's many creditors, who
will comb the statements for signs of inappropriate--or
fraudulent--payments that can be reclaimed to boost any potential
payback.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has offices in Beverly Hills, declined to
comment on the specifics in the report.</TE>

<TE>   Dixie Chicks, Sony End Feud With New Deal</TE>
<TE>   After suing Sony Corp. for breach of contract, the musical group
Dixie Chicks signed a lucrative new pact with the record company with
an estimated $20-million signing advance.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was made after the country music trio went public with
its complaint that Sony was shortchanging the group on royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new pact, the group is required to reimburse Sony for
about $15 million from record sales before collecting royalties, the
rate of which was increased to about 20%.</TE>

<TE>   Southwest Plans New Boarding System</TE>
<TE>   Southwest Airlines is retiring a waxy piece of airline history:
plastic boarding cards.</TE>
<TE>   The low-fare carrier, which doesn't use assigned seating, is
phasing out the reusable colored cards that have been a staple of the
airline since its founding three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two weeks, Southwest will shift to an automated
system in which passengers will get a paper boarding pass at the
ticket counter or at other locations in the airport, instead of
waiting in line at the boarding gate for the plastic card.</TE>
<TE>   With increased security and long lines at the airport since Sept.
11, waiting in one more line for the boarding card became too much of
a nuisance, Southwest said.</TE>

<HD>Weapon Sends Message That's Loud and Clear</HD>
<DH>San Diego tech firm's 'sonic bullets' could be the latest
device in the Pentagon's nonlethal arsenal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The shrill cry of a baby can be one of the most annoying sounds of
daily life, but it is music to Pentagon strategists.</LD>
<LD>   An electronics company, American Technology Corp., has turned the
wail of a baby into a weapon that fires "sonic bullets," narrow beams
of noise that exceed the human threshold of pain. It can incapacitate
people or compel them to flee.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives you the equivalent of an intense migraine headache,"
said Elwood G. Norris, the company's chairman and inventor of the
device. "It's just totally disabling."</LD>
<TE>   Norris uses 50 different sound tracks, or sonic bullets, in his
new weapon. For instance, it plays backward the sound of a baby
crying at 140 decibels, or 20 decibels above the threshold of pain.
The noise-level is similar to that of a passenger jet taking off.
Pentagon officials see many uses for Norris' invention, such as
controlling unruly crowds, foiling hijackers and keeping potential
suicide bombers at bay. A commercial variant also may have
applications in movie theaters, vending machines and retail stores.</TE>
<TE>   The sound technology is not the first time that Norris, has made
waves. A prolific inventor, he developed and patented a Doppler
system that is a key component of ultrasonic imaging technology. He
also invented the first digital sound-recording device, as well as a
microwave radar that can detect plastic land mines.</TE>
<TE>   The acoustic weapon is categorized by the Pentagon as nonlethal,
but it could damage hearing or cause psychological harm. It is one of
the more innovative devices among the nonlethal weapons the military
is developing, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very intrigued by these nonlethal weapons," said Loren
Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute think tank
in Arlington, Va. "Some acoustic weapons are so powerful that they
can knock you out."</TE>
<TE>   Acoustic Technology</TE>
<TE>   Weapons makers have been developing a nonlethal arsenal for
decades, but new advances in microwave and acoustic technology as
well as post-Sept. 11 security concerns have raised interest in such
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The signal emitted by the acoustic weapon can penetrate any
opening and bounce off surfaces before reaching the intended targets.
In Afghanistan, it could have been used to drive out enemy soldiers
holed up in caves and buildings.</TE>
<TE>   It could help an airline pilot fend off hijackers without harming
the aircraft or bystanders. And it could help military ships protect
their perimeters in port.</TE>
<TE>   "Sailors protecting Navy ships don't have anything between giving
a verbal warning and shooting a potential threat," said Terry Conrad,
American Technology's president. "Now you have something else you can
use before taking lethal action."</TE>
<TE>   Despite years of research on sound-harassment weapons, Pentagon
officials say this is the first time soldiers will be able to direct
the harassing sound at a particular individual or target.</TE>
<TE>   A significant feature of the device is the fact that the person
standing behind or next to the emitter can't hear the sound. It is
heard only by the person who is in the sound emitter's line of fire.</TE>
<TE>   In previous efforts to use sound as a weapon, soldiers could not
shield themselves from the irritating noise they were directing at a
target. When the Army tried to get Panama's former dictator, Manuel
Noriega, to surrender by blaring harassing music and sounds outside
his retreat, U.S. soldiers also complained.</TE>
<TE>   American Technology's weapon is based on a beaming technology that
Norris has been trying to perfect for more than seven years. Known as
the hypersonic sound system, it also is creating a major buzz within
the commercial acoustics industry.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a traditional speaker, which produces sound by vibrating
the membranes of a woofer or a tweeter, small crystal wafers project
a beam of sound across a room like a spotlight. The emitters are
semiconductors used by Norris in a configuration that produces
focused sound waves.</TE>
<TE>   The device sends out two ultrasonic signals that produce sound
only when they hit an object or a person.</TE>
<TE>   An emitter pointed at a wall will produce a sound that seems to be
coming from the wall, not the emitter. However, a person who is not
in the line of the beam will not hear anything unless the beam has
been bounced off the wall.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent test of the device in the company's parking lot, a
reporter stood about 100 feet from the emitter and could hear a radio
broadcast as though it were coming from within the ear. Norris then
pointed the emitter at a nearby window and it seemed as though the
sound were coming from within the building.</TE>
<TE>   Giant retailers are swarming to buy the product, Norris said. The
company is negotiating with an unidentified beverage company for a
one-year exclusive right to use the device in soda vending machines.
The company envisions a potential soda buyer standing in front of a
vending machine or a passerby hearing the sound of a can opening and
the soda fizzing as it is poured into a glass. The sound wouldn't be
heard by anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   After seven years of research and development, American Technology
recently received Food and Drug Administration approval to begin
marketing the product. The FDA determined that the new sound
technology does not have adverse health effects, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons version, which does not require FDA approval, uses
high-intensity emitters specially designed for the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Civilian Applications</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has been testing the technology on the U.S. missile
destroyer Winston Churchill as a way to communicate on board as well
as ship to ship during bad weather and when security concerns
preclude radio use. A typical Navy ship's sound system has about
3,000 speakers, many of them producing sounds that are muffled or
drowned out by other noise.</TE>
<TE>   Stereo-equipment manufacturers also are looking at the technology.
The system would allow individuals in a car to listen to different
music without using headphones, and movie theater operators would be
able to project the system off the screens, giving the audience the
illusion that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Norris said revenue from previous inventions is funding his new
research. American Technology is acquiring an electronics
manufacturer with 108,000 square feet of space that could produce
10,000 devices a month by October, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A simple version of the commercial system will sell for $200 to
$300.</TE>
<TE>   The sound technology "is the future for us," Norris said.</TE>

<HD>Chiquita, 18, Needs a Break From Family Leadership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KWALA MANDEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chiquita Williams has struggled to maintain her optimism and can-do
attitude since the violent death of her cousin a year ago. The
18-year-old reacted to her cousin's death--he was shot by a security
guard at a Pacoima Burger King after an argument escalated over a
drive-through order--by channeling her anger into raising money for
his funeral.</LD>
<LD>   "I know it was very hard on her," says Sandra Perez, program
director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of San Fernando Valley. "She went
to different people to raise the money. She stood outside of
supermarkets and explained the story to friends and neighbors so the
family could afford a burial."</LD>
<LD>   Providing for others is a familiar role for Williams, who has been
raised since she was a baby by her 74-year-old grandmother, Lela
Parks, who also cares for her younger sister and cousin. The senior
at King Drew Medical Magnet says that "basically everything I need, I
get myself. School supplies, or if I want to go to a movie, or if my
little sister needs something and I have money, I'll give it to her."</LD>
<TE>   "My sister and little cousins look up to me, but it is hard" to be
a role model, says Williams, whose mother has a drug problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I have cousins in gangs, and an older brother who didn't
graduate. Everyone depends on me. My little sister hears her friends
talking about new shoes and outfits, and I remember how that was. If
I want to change her experience, I'm going to have to stay in
school." Williams is headed to Cal State Northridge next fall.</TE>
<TE>   As a reward for being such a strong leader, the Boys &amp; Girls Club
of San Fernando Valley is working with the Times summer camp campaign
to send Chiquita, and 33 other children, to summer camp for one week.</TE>
<TE>   They are still trying to find ones that are affordable.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who met Williams six years ago, says she has come a long
way, from "a very feisty girl who needed some direction" to "a young
lady who doesn't follow anyone else and doesn't really care about
what anyone says about her."</TE>
<TE>   "Chiquita's worked as a youth employee since she was 14. It was
her way of getting what she needed, like clothes," says Perez. "She
worked at McDonald's until very late at night to make money for a
prom dress."</TE>
<TE>   Perez is counting on Williams' resourcefulness to face future
challenges. "She is very outgoing and driven," she says. "I commend
her for getting through it all."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   This year more than 11,000 children will experience a special
summer thanks to the $1.6 million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit www.latimes
.com/summercamp. Please do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<HD>A Need to Work Like a Dog</HD>
<DH>Recognition of the herder instinct enriches the life of
many a pet--and owner too</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider this scenario: Your newly adopted dog has just chased your
neighbors' cat across their lawn, through their screened window,
shattered two lamps, raced up the stairs and held the cat hostage in
their attic. You are enraged at the dog and liable for all damages.</LD>
<LD>   Does it even occur to you that the dog might not be chasing the
cat, but attempting to herd it? That he may not be misbehaving, but
succumbing to age-old instinct? Probably not. Because you, like most
people, may think herding is extinct--along with animals and people
who want to do it. You'd be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The cat/dog mayhem described above actually happened to Jon Katz.
He's a 6-foot, 230-pound urbanite best known until recently as a
respected writer on new media, new technology and other 21st century
subjects. He has written 11 books, numerous articles and is also
known among friends as a devoted husband, father and spiritual leader
of two placid yellow Labs, who dozed faithfully at Katz's feet for
years as he sat writing to earn their living. For most of his adult
life, he says, "my idea of excitement was to go to Yankee Stadium and
have two hot dogs."</LD>
<TE>   Then something "really bizarre" happened to Katz. He got a new
dog. Its name was Devon--a ne'er-do-well, 2-year-old border collie
who had failed at everything in life, including Freud's two biggies:
love and work. Devon was bred to be a competitive show dog--a job he
could not handle. He was, therefore, considered unfit by his first
owner, for pats, treats, "good dog" compliments and other perks that
would provide a pup with self-esteem. The rejected, dejected dog was
shipped back to the breeder, who induced Katz to give him a home.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear which of the two has helped the other more. Devon is
happy and fulfilled because he has both love and work--herding sheep.
Katz has a new life too, his writing focus and daily pursuits
transformed. He has become what he describes as "an itinerant
shepherd"--a guy who actually spends much time in a pasture, with 300
head of sheep, a wooden crook, and two young collies who assist him
(or vice versa) with the herding.</TE>
<TE>   "We have these amazing moments, the dogs and I," Katz says.
Sometimes we go out at 3 or 4 in the morning to graze the sheep for a
few hours. I lie down in the pasture and watch the meteor showers. We
also help with the lambing, shearing, worming," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Pennsylvania sheep farm where he's a volunteer shepherd is
about a 1 1/2-hour drive from his city house in New Jersey, which is
exactly 12 miles from the center of Manhattan. "Sheepherding isn't
dead, no matter what anyone tells you," Katz says.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, nobody tells us anything about shepherds and flocks
these days, except at church on Sunday mornings.</TE>
<TE>   Katz's new book, "A Dog Year: Twelve Months, Four Dogs, and Me"
(Villard Press), details one year from the day Devon arrived--by
air--from the breeder. A year in which Man and Dog--each going
through difficult times--found themselves through each other. And
through herding sheep.</TE>
<TE>   The book belongs to a small, relatively new genre of what might be
called animal memoirs. These are books about people and their pets
that do not dwell on either the person or the pet, but on the
relationship between them; the intertwining of two individual lives,
of two species.</TE>
<TE>   It is unsentimental--a small joy ride of a story about a man
trying to comprehend the needs of a certifiably nutty animal--a dog
whose brilliance is exceeded only by his Machiavellian talent for
mischief. It is a supremely satisfying tale because Katz understands
that Man and Dog are totally unalike yet capable of affection and
respect for each other. That's one definition of friendship.</TE>
<TE>   When Devon appeared, Katz's own life was in turmoil. His only
child, Emma, had just left for Yale. He was approaching middle age.
His few close friends had drifted away. He was not happy writing
about media and the Internet anymore. "I was doing a book on
interactivity for Random House. I hated it. I was distressed every
time I sat down at the computer.</TE>
<TE>   "This new dog lands in my life like a bomb. A Tomahawk missile.
And now, such a short time later, my whole life is all different. Now
I write about dogs and their people. I shepherd three or four times a
week. I have wonderful new friends. Devon did all that."</TE>
<TE>   Chasing Provides a Clue</TE>
<TE>   At first he seemed "crazy." Katz nicknamed him Helldog on his
first day, when the cur bolted his crate in the airport and raced
through the terminal, security police with guns drawn behind him. On
arrival at Katz's house, the dog Houdini'd himself out of the yard,
leaped onto the roof of an oncoming car and proudly held his ground
like a truant kid hitching a ride by hanging onto the back of a bus.</TE>
<TE>   Devon chased buses and trucks and everything that moved. No amount
of toys, food or petting seemed to calm him. It became evident to
Katz, eventually, that the dog wasn't chasing. He was herding. An
instinct native to the breed for at least 10,000 years. This epic
moment of understanding changed both their lives. Katz took the dog
to the sheep farm, where they trained at herding together and where
their problems eventually were resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Katz's book may be unusual, but his tale is not. Around the
country, thousands of people with various breeds of collies,
Australian or German shepherds, sheepdogs, Rottweilers--people who've
spent millions on their dogs' nutrition, health care and
recreation--are learning that dogs couldn't care less about designer
dog beds or high-tech toys.</TE>
<TE>   If they are herding breeds, they need to work at herding. It is a
job done in tandem with a human and requires some practice so that
man and dog can communicate through the subtlest of signals. Since
there are few sheep or cattle farms in most urban areas, smaller
facilities have sprung up around the country, where sheep are kept so
that city slickers (both dogs and people) can practice the ancient,
almost obsolete art.</TE>
<TE>   Classes in Herding</TE>
<TE>   Drummond Ranch, between Acton and Palmdale in the high Mojave
Desert, is such a place. Ted Thompson Ondrak, a former Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputy, and his wife, Janna, bought the 40-acre
ranch along with a few dozen sheep in 1999 as a training facility for
herding. They hold instinct tests to see if each dog has the desire
to herd. They hold classes for those that do, so that dog and owner
can communicate--and they offer sheepherding time for people who've
been through the training and want to work out with their dogs. It's
their full-time profession--and their passion.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are amazed to learn that the breeds they own are
herding breeds," says Ondrak. Those who love their dogs are happiest
doing what makes the dog happy. And if you see the dogs' faces when
they start herding, you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that they
love it. That's what makes it so magical."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday at the ranch, real-estate brokers Allan and Diane Gantt
arrived after a 1 1/2-hour drive from Fullerton to see if their
Canaan dog, Mystery Girl, has the herding instinct. "She's never even
seen a sheep," said Diane, sounding anxious. The couple have three
cats and noticed that the dog was trying to herd them. They watched
as Ondrak set the young dog loose in a small arena with a quartet of
sheep. In seconds, the pup was moving them around like an old
pro--using instincts even she didn't know were in her. It was, as
Ondrak had said, magical. The Gantts, close to tears, said they'd
sign her up.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Sal Manna of North Hollywood was there with Dharma, one of
two Australian shepherds he goes herding with twice each week. "It's
more fun and better behavior training than letting them run aimlessly
in the dog park," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Hutton, the Caltech seismologist, showed up with one of her
three dogs, two of which are herders. "It started when I owned a
cattle dog who was a handful in the house. I had to come up with
something for her to do. She was bored." Hutton found herding, which
she now enjoys most weekends, either at Drummond or a place in
Murietta run by Terry Parrish, who "rents out" some of her herding
dogs to local golf courses plagued with flocks of ducks who like the
greens as much as the golfers do.</TE>
<TE>   Influence of 'Babe'</TE>
<TE>   The sport has become a lot more popular since the movie "Babe"
came out in 1995, Hutton says. The film told the story of a pig who
learned to herd and eventually won the sheepdog trials by asking the
sheep, politely, to move. "That's the key," Hutton says. "The herder
dog has to let the sheep know it's in charge without biting or any
overt displays."</TE>
<TE>   Marsha Bain, of Hacienda Heights, a spinal-cord injury nurse at
Long Beach V.A. hospital, says she's become so involved with the
sport that she bought a "really big RV just so my dogs and I could
spend weekends here at the ranch. It's great exercise for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stewart provides open space and sheep at three locations in
Southern California--Long Beach, Anaheim Hills and Perris--for use by
people who want to enjoy herding with their dogs. An Orange County
native, he owned a fiberglass repair corporation from which he
retired at 35. "This is how I do my retirement," says the former
surfer, scuba diver and airplane pilot, who says his life changed
when he got a dog as a gift from a girlfriend some years back. "Easy
was a sheltie, a perfect companion until I'd drive through canyons.
Then he turned into Mr. Hyde, tried to jump out the windows, became
insane. I noticed it happened every time the dog saw cattle. Out of
my love for that dog, I tried to find a way to put his instincts to
constructive use."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart trained Easy to herd with him, "and doing that gave me a
whole new vocation. It's more than a profession. It's integrated into
my way of life. We had some monumental discussions--me and
Easy--learning how to do all this. Which is quite interesting,
because it's across species. I didn't just teach him. He taught me
things like what sound to make for specific herding behaviors."</TE>
<TE>   Few of the newly developed herding facilities are as bucolic as
the authentic sheep farm in Pennsylvania at which Katz spends so much
time. The real issue is not the location, but the experience of
herding, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Herding is actually a form of obedience training--a form they
instinctively understand. It makes the training so much easier and
the dog so much happier. People haven't been told that if their dog
bites, chews, ruins things, he is not bad. He is doing what dogs do.
He needs training he can comprehend."</TE>
<TE>   "A Dog Year," about Devon, is being made into a film by HBO.
Katz's next book, "The New Work of Dogs," illustrates how the work of
dogs has increasingly meant dealing with the emotional lives of
Americans. For that book, he follows a few people and their dogs for
a full year. "I go with them when they get the dog, to the vet and
the park with them." He has gone with women to "the divorced dog
club--a group of women who've divorced and gotten a dog to get them
through it, and meet once a week to discuss it all."</TE>
<TE>   He is following a woman of 53, who has no family, who is dying of
breast cancer, he says. "She got a corgi named Reggie. Their
relationship is amazing. She sings to him all the time. She is buying
a piece of land to build a little house where she can go with Reggie
to die. She's made arrangements with a friend to care for him when
that happens."</TE>
<TE>   And he's following a city guy named Bill. "He's ancient, his dog
is ancient; he's toothless, his dog is toothless. The dog is
ill-tempered and smelly and sick. So is Bill. They love each other
more than any two creatures on Earth. Penny keeps Bill alive, and
vice versa. He walks her a few times a day. They sit on the front
stoop at night; he with Penny on a leash. She tries to bite
everything that moves, but he sits there beaming like a proud papa,
constantly repeating, 'Isn't she a doll, isn't she a doll?' "</TE>
<TE>   Katz says Penny is every bit as much a working dog as his own
border collie. "She takes care of him. And at dinner time, he takes
whatever food he has and splits it exactly in half, so each of them
gets the same size portion. It's so tragic, but it's beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Katz already has the go-ahead from his agent and publisher for the
book after that one, which will be about sheepherding. "I'm a dog
writer now. I love what I'm writing. Don't get me wrong. I've always
loved my work and wrote some books that pleased me. But I've had some
pretty lonely signings and readings at bookstores--certainly no
crowds.</TE>
<TE>   "With 'A Dog Year,' the readings are standing room only. People
come with pictures of their dogs; they want to tell me stories. They
bring treats for my dogs, who go with me to every appearance. The
dogs work the crowd like two pros. They walk up and down the aisles,
getting pats and eating treats. They come back to my table and go to
sleep. At the very end, they get up when people clap, as if to take
bows. Believe me, if there was any rescue involved when I got Devon,
it was the dog who rescued me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Students at Charnock Road Elementary in Los Angeles have been teased,
and this is what they say about it.</LD>
<LD>   * When I was in kindergarten, a boy from first grade teased me. He
was bigger than me. I told him, "Go pick on someone your own size!"
But he didn't leave me alone. So I told on him, and he didn't tease
me again--until the next day. I told my teacher, and he never
bothered me again in his life. (Melissa, 8)</LD>
<LD>   * My brothers tease me. They won't listen when I say to stop. But
they might beat me up if I get them mad. I am only 8 years old. What
did I do? I did my best by being courageous, and I did make them stop
teasing me! I am just like the boy in "Brave as a Mountain Lion" and
Molly in "Molly the Brave and Me" from our stories in class.
(Michael, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * There were two big boys teasing me. I didn't care about them,
only what my mom said. She said, "Don't care about the boys who
teased you." (Jenny, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * When my friend got teased, I said to the teaser, "Stop teasing
my friend." One of my other friends fell, and then a bully laughed. I
said, "Knock it off!" When their mom got to the playground, I told
what they did to my friend. She told them, "Don't do it again!"
(Daaron, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * One time I was called "four eyes" by a fifth-grader because I
have glasses. He was very tall and a very mean bully. What I did was
I told him that maybe someday he will have glasses too, then everyone
will call him "four eyes." He made a funny face and walked away.
(Marisa, 7)</TE>
<TE>   * One day this girl came up to me and said, "You have ashy legs."
Then she started laughing. I said in my head, "She's very rude and
mean." Then I said, "Go away and leave me alone!" Then I said, "You
should knock it off!" So then I told the coach on her. She got in
trouble and had to sit on the bench. (Paris, 7)</TE>

<HD>Hoping Their Makeup Takes a Powder</HD>
<DH>Trading 'gently used' cosmetics might not be sanitary, but
it's a booming hobby</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By late morning on a weekday, 368 messages have been posted since
midnight on the swap board at MakeupAlley.com. Each represents a
beauty product that one of the site's members has tried and grown
tired of and is ready to trade for someone else's castoff cosmetics.
Chirpy sales pitches and brand-specific wish lists echo with longing,
disappointment and regret.</LD>
<LD>   "Sixty percent left. Perfect for someone who wants to try out the
color before purchasing," a new entry writes of the MAC lipstick she
has just listed in hopes of getting her hands on "anything!!!" by La
Mer or a Nars blush in Orgasm or Sin. From Australia comes a report
of an Urban Decay eye shadow: "Great condition, no dips."</LD>
<LD>   A board veteran based in Florida, meanwhile, has spent 1 1/2 hours
painstakingly putting 37 lotions, powders, glosses and lacquers up
for grabs. Her unwanted booty includes a Bobbi Brown eyeliner ("I
just couldn't get this to work for me"), and a Lorac blush powder she
estimates she has used four times. "I purchased this about three
months ago and realized I have another blush that looks identical,"
she confesses. Within hours, she is flooded with offers.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the world of cosmetics swappers. Despite the
well-advertised health hazards--such as pinkeye or herpes--associated
with sharing makeup, at least a half-dozen Web sites are set up for
anyone to exchange--"recycle" is the preferred term in
swap-speak--their "gently used" (read: secondhand) toiletries. At
Makeup Alley alone, more than 80,000 items are available for barter
at any given time--each a separate listing--and hundreds of
swap-related messages are exchanged every day.</TE>
<TE>   "These women are die-hard beauty aficionados. They always want to
try something new. Swapping makes it economical," said Makeup Alley
founder Hara Glick, 33, who lives in Manhattan. Along with a product
review page and beauty chat boards, the swap board is one of Glick's
3-year-old site's most popular features. "It's a really nice,
one-on-one interaction with another person who also has a love of
makeup and beauty," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Kinder, 27, of Anaheim, admits she was initially hesitant
to try swapping when she stumbled across one of the first sites
devoted to the practice, Mikki's Swap Page, seven years ago. "I was
like, 'Hmmm, is it sanitary? How do you know you aren't going to get
ripped off? Why won't you just buy it yourself?' " Kinder said.</TE>
<TE>   After befriending several women on the site and finding they knew
as much about makeup as she did, Kinder decided to take the plunge
with some trendy nail polish she had been coveting. "At some point,
you've got to trust that the people you are swapping with are careful
with their stuff too," she said. Several successful swaps later, she
was a convert, preferring to trade away her unwanted items rather
than "deal with the hassles of returning them." Inspired by Mikki's
Swap site, which Kinder has since taken over, she has now founded her
own beauty site, BeautyBuzz.com.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, to minimize the ick factor inherent in their hobby,
experienced swappers engage in elaborate pre- and post-swap
decontamination rituals. They slice lipstick tips with razor blades
and swab them with alcohol. They scrape off the top layers of eye
shadows and blushes. Puffs, brushes and sponges that come with
compacts are either hand-washed or replaced. Many swappers also save
the original packaging from their products so if they wind up in
turnaround, they can be advertised as "SIB" (Still in Box).</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, how many people pay $50 for a foundation, use it
twice, get fickle and then decide they want to try something else?
With swapping, you are able to take that $50 and trade it for $50
worth of something else you haven't tried," said Teri Castell, 41, a
Makeup Alley regular who also operates a site called Goo4Swap.com,
which includes an online "journal" chronicling the best and worst of
her swapping experiences.</TE>
<TE>   The cosmetics industry, however, takes a dim view of swapping.
"It's not hygienic, and it has the potential to be quite dangerous,"
said Irene Malbin, a spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and
Fragrance Assn., a trade group based in Washington, D.C. "When you
are sharing cosmetics, you have no idea how many people have used
this product that you are now going to put on your skin or, if you
are talking about lipstick, ingest. You don't know if they had clean
hands when they were using it. You don't know when it was opened. You
don't know where it's been."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates cosmetics,
frequently warns consumers against makeup sharing under any
conditions, despite the fact that preservatives in the products are
said to destroy bacteria introduced through normal use.</TE>
<TE>   But Glick believes opponents of swapping overstate the dangers.
Swapping, she said, is "much more sanitary than going into a
department store and using one of those testers that's been tried by
100 women during the day."</TE>
<TE>   The risks associated with swapping, however, go beyond contracting
pinkeye from an infected mascara wand. Although Makeup Alley members
award one another feedback "tokens" grading the quality of their
swaps, the self-policing system isn't foolproof. Anyone who has been
swapping for a while has a story about being "swaplifted"--getting
shorted on the return half of a swap. Swapping swindles are so common
that an electronic bulletin board called Swap Tawk was established
where burned swappers can post names and e-mail addresses of
wrongdoers. A separate "Problem Swappers Page" includes instructions
on how to file mail fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   Swapping has another downside too. Although most women initially
see it as a way to pare impulse buys, last season's "must-have"
shades and other mistakes from their beauty arsenals, many find they
end up with even more products, their appetites fueled by others'
raves about the latest lines and colors. Swappers call this the
"lemming effect."</TE>
<TE>   As with many activities that didn't exist before the advent of the
Internet, makeup swapping started as an underground movement known
only to a handful of cyberspace pioneers. One of the first sites, the
now-defunct Mikki's Swap Page, was the brainchild of an 18-year-old
Texan who charged users a $9 annual fee to list their products. (Most
of today's sites are supported by advertisers and are free to users.)</TE>
<TE>   In its early days, swapping was especially popular with
fashion-minded residents of small towns without access to products in
the latest magazines, Kinder said. With the advent of e-commerce
beauty sites, some of that motivation was lost but swapping continued
to thrive as a virtual garage sale for the kind of women who think
nothing of dropping $300 on a trip to Sephora.</TE>
<TE>   "Swapping gives people the comfort to be able to try things they
normally wouldn't try and to be able to not feel totally guilty if
they don't like it," said Stevie Wilson, 41, a Long Beach writer and
event coordinator who swaps through Makeup Alley and an Internet
newsgroup called alt.fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Like any other virtual community, the society of swappers has its
own slang and etiquette to discourage dilettantes. "Lippie" is short
for lipstick, and "e/s" refers to eye shadow. "GWP" stands for "gift
with purchase" and refers to a promotion sample. Popular product
lines have acronyms--"PX" for Prescriptives, and "MUFE" for Makeup
Forever.</TE>
<TE>   Misrepresenting a product's condition--describing a half-full tube
of lipstick as "barely used," for instance--can get someone labeled
as a bad swapper, as can offering a handful of Maybelline eye pencils
or Wet 'n Wild lipsticks in exchange for a pricey Yves St. Laurent
makeup palette. And though a swap may officially involve only one
item, swappers are almost universally expected to toss in samples,
products they were unable to unload, or other extras along with their
shipments, lest they appear stingy.</TE>
<TE>   "What starts out as one or two items ends up as a whole box of
stuff. It can be like Christmas, kind of gross," swapper Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although many swappers happily share stories of the friendships
they've established online, to some extent these bonds are forged on
mutual shame. Shannon Gaverick said she rarely tells non-swapping
friends about the extent of her makeup habit. "People think it's,
'Eewww, How can you swap for other people's lipstick?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   One L.A.-based swapper agreed to talk about her experiences only
if she were guaranteed anonymity. "I'm a full-time law student and
really don't want to be known in my community as a makeup swapper,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Women's relationships with the beauty industry, of course, have
always been fraught with irony. And swapping is no exception.
According to veteran swappers, if they put a dollar value on the time
they spend posting, bubble-wrapping and mailing their old cosmetics,
not to mention scouting the swap board for things they want in
return, it would probably be cheaper to go out and buy something
straight from a department store counter.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, no one--including the most devoted of swappers--is
arguing that this is an activity that makes a whole lot of sense.</TE>
<TE>   "We swappers are all sort of gluttons," Castell said. "It's quite
a selective hobby because it's a hobby of luxury. It's not a
necessary thing, but it's fun."</TE>

you are swapping with are careful with their stuff too," Melissa

<LD>Ask a child in the midst of an evening's worth of homework what she'd
like to do during summer vacation, and the answer is certain and
clear: Nothing. (Translation: No camps or classes. Just sleep, snacks
and plenty of TV.)</LD>
<LD>   But the moment the school year ends, "nothing" is apt to be
replaced with alarming alacrity by the phrase that makes parents
cringe: "I'm bored."</LD>
<LD>   This year, school was out for less than 24 hours before my
11-year-old threw down the gauntlet. She was bored with the computer,
the pool, the video games. She had no one to play with. She'd read
all the books she cared to read. She'd worn out the remote control
and found nothing worth watching on TV.</LD>
<TE>   There's nothing to do around here, she whined. Could you maybe
take me to the mall?</TE>
<TE>   But I'm not biting this time around. I've spent so many years
trying to fill my kids' summers with stimulation and fun, I'm bored
with that game ... and tired, to boot.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody's looking for something to do? The flower beds out front
need weeding. The dogs haven't been walked or fed. The rabbit's cage
is overdue for a cleaning. There's a laundry basket full of towels
that need folding and socks that need mates.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise, surprise....She retreats to the TV room. Suddenly Jenny
Jones' "Extreme Makeovers" and "Men Caught Hiring Hit Men" on Montel
Williams' show seem a bit more interesting after all.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to feel frustrated by the complaints of a pampered child
with the luxury of a string of empty days. When I was young, doing
what my kids consider "nothing" for an entire summer was an
acceptable alternative ... and sometimes the only choice we had.</TE>
<TE>   Stop me if you've heard this before, but there were no computers
or videos or cable TV; no instant messages or homemade CDs. We didn't
have a swimming pool or air-conditioning, so when we wanted a respite
from the heat, we rode our bikes to the library. We slept late in the
morning, stayed out after dark and spent our afternoons in someone's
basement, playing card games or querying the Ouija board or creating
dance routines that we'd later perform.</TE>
<TE>   Summer was a time of independence, when we could set our own
schedules and make our own choices, because there was nothing we had
to do, no place we were required to be. Parents, if they were around
at all, existed on the periphery, setting up the Slip 'n Slide,
making Kool-Aid and sandwiches, pulling splinters out of bare feet
and painting Mercurochrome on skinned knees.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the lack of direction we displayed would be considered
aimlessness. And we're afraid to give our children that kind of
freedom, lest unwise choices waste valuable time. "We encourage you
to fill your summer with lots of reading," says the note that came
home from my daughter's school, with a list of books to be read
before September, and five pages of suggested titles that would
"enrich" our family's life.</TE>
<TE>   I've noticed that hardly a day passes when the mailbox doesn't
yield a brochure for a summer camp or class that will "enrich,
advance and challenge your child." Even the family trip--done
right--now seems to require inordinate planning, given that "summer
travel provides many opportunities for using the math skills that
children have learned ... [and] can also be a time to write journal
impressions."</TE>
<TE>   Family vacations must be "managed," a parents' magazine advises,
if they are to be successful: Don't pack too much into a single day,
because that can create tension. Plan "alone time" for each family
member and accommodate individual needs for rest and relaxation.
Recognize that children might feel bored because they're deprived of
their favorite TV shows or friends.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. Try
to cure their boredom with a family trip, and your kids will whine
about missing their friends.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter's in her pajamas when I get home, though it's 5
o'clock in the afternoon. Her feet are dirty, her face smudged with
chocolate, her hair is damp and still uncombed. All around me I see
evidence of the "boring" day she must have had.</TE>
<TE>   In the backyard, the hose has been tied in a circle and slung over
the fence and into the pool. Rock climbing, her big sister and
baby-sitter explain. She tied the hose around her waist, pretended
she was trapped beneath a waterfall and rappelled up the side of the
pool in a series of dramatic rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the dog is wearing a scarf and his fur is tied back in a
ponytail. Arranged on his bed are a blanket, a book and a sippy cup.
He was the baby, I imagine, and my daughter read to him then tried to
put him to bed.</TE>
<TE>   In her bedroom, I find two rows of Beanie Babies lined up in front
of a blackboard, with the days of the week neatly written out in
Spanish. School, not much different from the way my sister and I used
to play it.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of her day I can figure out. The basketball by the front
door. The grimy socks next to the trampoline. The patio littered with
candy wrappers, empty juice boxes and dogeared magazines. The wet
swimsuit on the bathroom floor.</TE>
<TE>   It makes me tired just reconstructing her day's routine ... tired
enough that all I can do is smile when she wanders over and looks at
me expectantly. "I'm glad you're home," she says. "I'm bored."</TE>

<LD>Cars &amp; Stars</LD>
<LD>   "Sheesh! Is that a sexy beast or what?" muttered a smitten car
buff as he ogled the voluptuous chassis of a 1939 Bugatti 57C at the
Petersen Automotive Museum's Fifth Annual Cars &amp; Stars Gala. If only
the 25 marvelous machines in the new exhibition, "Million Dollar
Cars: The World's Most Valuable Automobiles," could talk.</LD>
<LD>   The Bugatti, hidden from the West for more than two decades, was a
wedding gift from the French government to the shah of Iran. The
winnings of Henry Ford's 1901 sweepstakes race car (top speed 72 mph)
were the jump-start that bankrolled the Ford Motor Co.; Steve
McQueen's 1956 XKSS Jaguar was one of only 16 made; a 1928 Bentley
was one of many owned by the maharaja of Bhavnager. And then there's
Pasadenan Harold Meyerman's pride and joy--a 1939 Maybach SW 38 red
roadster that languished in his mother's garage until he spent more
than $400,000 restoring it, bolt by bolt, to its former Teutonic
grandeur. "We're told that only two of these were made," said
Meyerman. "The other one came up missing after the war."</LD>
<TE>   Another showstopper: a 1938 Dubonnet Hispano-Suiza, named after
Andre Dubonnet of the French wine family. It was one of the most
striking cars of its era, featuring a wraparound windshield and one
of the earliest targa tops ever conceived.</TE>
<TE>   "With more than $100 million worth of cars in one place, this is
by far the most extraordinary exhibit we've ever mounted," noted
Petersen curator Leslie Kendall.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,200 auto aficionados attended the June 13 event, which
raised more than $750,000. Added to that was a $500,000 donation from
the Mary and Gordon Howard Family Foundation. Howard's widow, Mary,
and her daughter, Kathy Phelan, were on hand for the event, along
with Margie and Bob Petersen, Raylene and Bruce Meyer, Merle and
Peter Mullin, Alexandria Phillips, Ginny and David Sydorick, Bill
Ahmanson and a host of stars, including Loni Anderson, Connie
Stevens, Thomas Gibson, Carol Connors, Norm Crosby, Phyllis Diller,
Erik Estrada, Anne Jeffreys, Nina Kaczorowski, Lois and Buzz Aldrin
(a dinner for eight at Spago with the astronaut and his moon-gal sold
for $4,600 in the live auction) and the newly engaged Cindy Garvey
and Bob Lorsch.</TE>

<TE>   Beastly Ball</TE>
<TE>   Gita, a 44-year-old Asian elephant, was the belle of the Los
Angeles Zoo Assn.'s annual Beastly Ball. Not only an accomplished
abstract painter--as demonstrated in her trunk show--she also plays
the xylophone and doubles in brass on the cymbals. The fund-raiser,
in its 32nd year, raised $1.74 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gita's zoo neighbors weren't as impressed with her talents as were
the 1,100 safari-clad party guests, who paid $500 to watch her grip a
dripping paintbrush while artist Charles Bragg maneuvered the canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from Gita's two masterpieces, which sold for $5,000
apiece in the evening's live auction, are earmarked for the zoo's new
Pachyderm Forest. Meanwhile, her next-door neighbor, Bruno, a clearly
disgruntled senior orangutan, retired to the highest rock in his digs
to view the foofaraw. "He's not the jealous type," noted a vigilant
staffer. "He's just spooked by the stilt-walkers."</TE>
<TE>   The event honored zoo commissioner Karen B. Winnick, whose family
foundation funded the children's zoo that opened last summer. The
annual Fellow Award went to renowned naturalist Cynthia Moss for her
work with the Maasai people to save Kenya's elephants. Between 1973
and 1989, 85% of Kenya's elephant population was slaughtered for
ivory. Moss, who is convalescing from recent surgery, sent her thanks
via video from the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, which she
directs in southern Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   More than two-dozen premium Southern California eateries were
stationed around the zoo grounds, where they dispensed specialties
like pumpkin lasagna, green corn tamales, Krispy Kreme doughnuts--and
buffalo tartare. Spotted among the grazers were Bob Saget, who emceed
the doings; zoo execs Don Youpa and Manuel Mollinedo; Gary Winnick;
Linda DeKoven and David Israel; Nancy and Dick Riordan; Michele and
Walter Conn; Constance and John Gavin; Cheryl Post; Mary and Bill
Urquhart; Missy and Dennis Alfieri; Gary Kaplan; Patti Glover; and
zoo trustee Betty White.</TE>

<TE>   Social Swim</TE>
<TE>   Outfitted in tuxes and cocktail dresses, hundreds of guests
attending a benefit at the Aquarium of the Pacific did what thousands
of children are expected to do this summer: They got face-to-face
with more than 150 sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Housed in the facility's new 90,000-gallon outdoor Shark Lagoon,
some of the creatures were available for petting at the Ocean
Conservation Awards gala that raised $260,000 for the Long Beach
aquarium's conservation and education programs. "Ooooh, it feels like
a man's stubble in the morning," said family doctor Debbie Lowenthal
as she stroked the head of a zebra shark. "Kind of like sandpaper in
one direction--silk in the other."</TE>
<TE>   Guests swept along a red carpet as they entered the
$500-per-ticket event where they sipped champagne and sampled
appetizers alfresco before dining on Alaskan white king salmon (a
non-endangered species) in the Great Hall of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The $3-million exhibit is "the largest touch-opportunity for
sharks in the United States and was totally financed by private
contributions," said aquarium board chairman James Hankla. "We hope
it brings home to people what a perishable resource sharks are and
how important they are to viable oceanic ecosystems."</TE>
<TE>   Receiving awards were conservationists Julie Packard, founding
executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium; actor Ted Danson
(who was unable to attend), founding president of the American Oceans
Campaign; and Warren Iliff, founding president and chief executive of
the Aquarium of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a national ocean policy," Packard told the crowd.
"We need to realize that land and sea are connected and do more to
make sure that coastal development doesn't further degrade our
waters."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer C. Hagle and Lynne M. Presto were co-chairwomen of the
June 15 event.</TE>

<TE>   Mayhem on Menu</TE>
<TE>   In a playful whodunit, guests at a benefit for Pacific Chorale
spent an evening trying to figure out who "murdered" its artistic
director, John Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County arts leaders headed the list of suspects, including
Devious Dean (Philharmonic Society director Dean Corey), Merciless
Morr (executive vice president of the Performing Arts Center, Judith
Morr), and Hostile Hubbard (Opera Pacific director Martin Hubbard).
What weapon was used? And where did the murder occur?</TE>
<TE>   Those were the questions more than 185 guests--gussied up in
fashions from the '40s--tried to answer as they sipped cocktails and
enjoyed dinner at the waterfront Harbor Island residence of arts
benefactors Phil and Mary Lyons. The Murder at the Lighthouse benefit
netted $65,000 for chorale operations and education programs. Janice
Johnson was gala chairwoman of the June 15 event.</TE>
<TE>   The culprit, by the way: Devious Dean in the pub with a rifle.</TE>

Journalist, By Jack Newfield, St. Martin's: 352 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS BAKER</AU>
<BD>Russ Baker is a contributing editor of the Columbia
Journalism Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something has happened to American journalism. Within the
increasingly corporate corridors of newspapers today, depressingly
few editors or reporters stand out for doing things differently.
There are good and legitimate reasons why newspeople are encouraged
to excel only within conventional bounds (ownership, finances, public
perceptions, presumed neutrality). But there are equally good reasons
(often the very same ones) for celebrating freethinkers and
mavericks. As annoying as they might be, as much as they make the
suits nervous, these oddballs infuse journalism with a feistiness, a
cantankerousness, a sense of outrage and a sense of fun. They also
play a critical role in keeping the body politic healthy--or trying
to make it so.</LD>
<LD>   Two new memoirs from notable journalists demonstrate the range of
rebelliousness. Jim Bellows, author of "The Last Editor: How I Saved
the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times
from Dullness and Complacency," is a coat-and-tie man nevertheless
dedicated to impish irreverence. Jack Newfield, author of "Somebody's
Gotta Tell It: The Upbeat Memoir of a Working-Class Journalist," is a
crusading outsider, a New York poor boy with conflicting urges: a
passion for attacking the citadel and a not-so-secret hankering for a
place at the table.</LD>
<TE>   Bellows got his start on a small daily deep in Ku Klux Klan
territory and quickly became a legend in big-city newsrooms, keeping
alive feisty, second-ranked newspapers by revitalizing their writing.
Newfield made his name during the heyday of the definitive
alternative weekly, the Village Voice, then became a muckraking
columnist for two of New York's daily tabloids. Both men's commitment
to productive troublemaking emerged from childhoods in which they
were, literally or metaphorically, the little guy. Newfield's career
arc owes much to the lingering insecurity of an only-child,
fatherless youth; Bellows' stems from the pressures of being just 5
feet tall as a high school senior (before sprouting in college).</TE>
<TE>   During his six decades in journalism, the laconic Bellows has
stayed quietly behind the scenes while fostering innovation and
nurturing some of the country's finest writers. Everywhere he went,
he challenged his charges to take the kind of risks that create a
stir. At the New York Herald Tribune, he boosted such unknowns as
Jimmy Breslin, Tom Wolfe, Dick Schaap and Judith Crist, and he
encouraged sportswriter Red Smith to stretch his considerable talent.
Out of the Bellows-inspired ferment at the Trib came the personal,
in-your-face dynamism of the "new journalism"--and the idea that
newswriting could uplift, transform and amuse.</TE>
<TE>   "[P]eople would ask me: How do you get all this high-powered
talent? How do you get them all singing on the same page? How does
such a self-effacing guy do it? But that's the very thing that did
it." If Bellows' book has a flaw, it is that he stuffs his memoir
with too many other voices, in the form of boxed remembrances,
compliments and commentary. But even here, the inclusion of some
barbed criticism of his career ultimately serves to make him more
likable.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows probably did more than any other person to improve some of
America's biggest newspapers. Not by working for them, but against
them. "The 'second paper' in town has usually been my home," he
writes. "Second papers have more excitement than number one. Easy
Street is not a good address for innovation."</TE>
<TE>   While the Washington Post was perfecting its mix of investigative
reporting and insider political coverage in the 1970s, Bellows was at
the Washington Star, puncturing the Post's pomposity. He started a
fearless and funny gossip column, the Ear, assigned an
ahead-of-its-time piece on gay athletes and aggressively recruited
and promoted minorities and women (including Diane K. Shah, one of
the first female sports columnists, and Mary Anne Dolan, who
succeeded him at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, becoming the first
woman at the helm of a large daily.)</TE>
<TE>   His one fling with a market leader, editing soft news under the
Los Angeles Times' Nick Williams in the 1960s, was a disappointment.
Trying to inject an edge into a complacent paper, he ran afoul of
entrenched interests and attitudes. "[T]oo many oxes are gored ...
too many segments of our middle-class audience are offended,"
Williams cautioned Bellows about his refashioned of The Times'
then-magazine, West. "We have GOT to watch the mix. We have GOT to
avoid over-sophistication .... This is NOT a national mag." And, when
an article noted few differences among local supermarket prices,
Williams cautioned, "One thing you've got to hammer into the heads of
ALL 'West' staffers--never KNOCK an advertiser, even gently."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the early 1980s, Bellows, never fearful of something
new, helped launch the precocious online service Prodigy, worked in
television and collaborated with the twentysomething creators of the
search engine Excite. Shy but not retiring, the octogenarian has just
been named editor of a nascent glossy political magazine, "Common
Good."</TE>
<TE>   A master of understatement and dry wit who readily admits that his
memoirs benefited from the attentions of a talented writer, Gerald
Gardner, Bellows champions what might be called newsprint sensibility
in an age of multimedia ephemera and distraction. He deplores the
waves of consolidation that have left most American cities with just
one chain-owned newspaper. In the end, most of the papers he worked
at did vanish, but not before leaving their imprint on their larger
competitors. His rivals appropriated many of Bellows' innovations,
recruited his stars and became feistier and livelier for having
battled the man for readers. In his memoir, Bellows contextualizes a
professional life well-lived, and he is loath to leave out relevant
details, including an affair that ended the first of his three
marriages and the unsuccessful cancer battle that ended the second,
happier union.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Newfield, by comparison, warns us that some subjects are off
limits. "Intimate public confession is not my temperament," he
writes. Instead, Newfield offers us a familiar story with a twist. A
Jewish boy grows up a fatherless only child in a predominantly black
neighborhood. His love for the underdog Brooklyn Dodgers and their
color-barrier-breaking star Jackie Robinson grows into a lifelong
commitment to equality and an equally strong contempt for all abusers
of power.</TE>
<TE>   Being the right person at the right place and time, Newfield
becomes Herr Zeitgeist, vividly taking us through the great liberal
causes of the last half-century: civil rights, the antiwar movement,
power struggles at the Village Voice, encounters with the mob, New
York City government corruption and, later, newspaper strikes and
upheavals at the New York Daily News and the New York Post. A classic
practitioner of advocacy journalism, simultaneously writing about and
participating in the politics and movements of his time, Newfield
apprenticed himself to or befriended many seminal figures, from the
father of Democratic Socialism, Michael Harrington, to Robert F.
Kennedy. He's a guy's guy reporter, getting close to some of the
boxing greats, rousting crooked politicians and incompetent judges.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the book is an effort to explain what those turbulent
decades meant. Though Newfield skirts deep insights, he offers
compelling witness to key historical events, such as Robert F.
Kennedy's transformation from political infighter to a social
reformer, a makeover in which Newfield played a prominent role.
Newfield casts Kennedy as an authentically reborn man, but there are
also revealing asides: "When I told Kennedy that McCarthy was going
to run, he replied, 'I don't believe it. He is not that sort of
fellow. And if he does run, it will be to increase his lecture fees.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Among the better fly-on-the-wall moments is a previously
unreported 1977 incident when New York City mayoral candidate and
future governor Mario Cuomo, who would develop a reputation for
introspection and thoughtful oratory, punched out a conservative
activist. Newfield was also on hand to witness some reckless
acting-out by a young Tom Hayden: "[McCarthy speechwriter] Jeremy
[Larner] said something that Tom disagreed with, and Tom suddenly
lunged at Jeremy with chopsticks, trying to gouge his eyes out." More
than once, Newfield was swept up emotionally in the moment: "I threw
a typewriter out the window of the [Chicago] Hilton Hotel, at the
police, when I saw kids getting beaten."</TE>
<TE>   Newfield virtually brags about his lack of professional distance,
gleefully displaying his many hats. "I could balance these rather
obvious conflicts of interest only because I was working for a paper
like the Voice, which specialized in personal advocacy reporting and
made no pretense of objectivity. It defined itself as a corrective to
the mainstream media and a forum for personal experiences, honestly
described."</TE>
<TE>   Newfield possesses what the uniquely elegant newsman Murray
Kempton called "losing side consciousness." His pamphleteering and
journalistic sleuthing accomplished much good, changing the lives of
some of society's least privileged members, from lead paint victims
to abused nursing home residents. While lending an ear to the
chronically unheard, he went ferociously after some formidable foes,
including the seemingly never-ending supply of corrupt New York City
officials. His trademark "New York's Ten Worst Judges" feature was a
landmark in the fight for accountability. But as in some of his
journalistic crusades, his memoir is marred by sloppy delivery,
including hopscotch chronology, a propensity for lists of names that
mean nothing to us and embarrassing misspellings. Newfield, an angry
man who has trouble separating his journalistic mission from the
personal demons to which he will only allude, writes in a style far
better suited to a column than a book.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, his pleasure in knowing the powerful is plain. He
quotes his close friend Cuomo's opinion that "Jack Newfield is one of
the great columnists in the country." Nevertheless, it appears that
Newfield is not a contented man. Speaking of the much-loved Kempton,
he confesses: "I envied Murray's forgiving nature and always
suspected he knew something I did not."</TE>
<TE>   His exploration of his lifelong passion for boxing is a typical
mix of riveting firsthand reporting, indifferent writing and
inadequate analysis. He tells some good boxing stories, but scants
key episodes, including his ongoing feud with boxing promoter Don
King. Here is his defense of a sport that he readily concedes
exploits poor black men and often leaves its practitioners drooling
half-wits: "Boxing is--and has always been--a corrupt, brutal and
unfair sport ... [but] it is too deep in our blood to be
abolished.... I view boxing through an economic populist lens and try
to apply the values of equity, workplace safety, government
regulation, and unionism to the sports slum of sad endings." Once or
twice, he lets his guard down: "Boxing taught me that it was not
unmanly to feel fear."</TE>
<TE>   Imperfections notwithstanding, Newfield and Bellows represent two
kinds of courageous journalistic voices, and their careers remind us
of the importance of protecting a diverse range of opinion and style.
"As the voices diminish in number," Bellows writes near the end of
his book, "our lives are diminished, too."</TE>

<DH>THE PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA TRAIL, By John Pope-Hennessy,
With an essay, "The Best Picture," by Aldous Huxley, The Little
Bookroom: 88 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BERGER</AU>
<BD>John Berger is a novelist, poet, screenwriter and art
critic. He is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction,
including "About Looking," "Ways of Seeing" and "G.," for which he
won the Booker Prize. His most recent books are "Selected Essays" and
"The Shape of a Pocket."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go into the meadows one April afternoon and collect a bunch of
wildflowers. If the area hasn't been subjected to industrial
agriculture, you may find 20 or more varieties. If you take only one
of each, it will be a small bunch. There will probably be white,
yellow, blue, pink, purple flowers, and as you look at the bunch,
clasped in your hand, you will notice that the colors, now gathered
together and close to one another, have changed and appear to be much
more vivid and intense than they were when growing in the grass or
under the trees. They have acquired an intensity, a harmony and an
intentionality such as one normally associates with a work of art.</LD>
<LD>   How you explain this depends upon your philosophical approach. You
can treat it simply as a strange optical phenomenon. You can accept
it as a revelation of a given natural order, to which the human eye
is, or has become, perceptive. Either way it speaks of a convergence
between the human eye, an aesthetic emotion and a botanical order.</LD>
<LD>   Later, you take the bunch of flowers home, put them in a glass or
vase with water and place them on a table. When they catch your eye
the same evening or next morning, you may simply remember the
pleasure of a spring walk, or you may find yourself pondering the
enigma of how Nature has evolved (Nature including yourself) in all
its complexities.</LD>
<TE>   All cultures have made symbols of plants, the symbolism referring,
by way of what is apparent and visible, to a hidden, invisible order.
And this is what Piero della Francesca (who did not paint flowers as
such) was concerned with.</TE>
<TE>   His work is a meditation upon the unity of the natural order, a
unity made manifest by visual metaphors, equivalences and the
all-embracing interconnectedness of natural forms. Besides being a
painter, he was a mathematician. A lot of Renaissance painting
connects with geometry. Perhaps Della Francesca's work can be better
thought of as algebraic. He was concerned with finding equivalencies
which speak of resolution. He sought in what he chose to paint
nothing less than the original and the continuing act of (divine)
Creation. I place divine in parentheses simply because the faith
which sustained him came as much from what he saw with his eyes, from
what he stared at, as from theological doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   When he grew old, he became blind--as if his eyes finally gave out
after struggling to hold so much together.</TE>
<TE>   To approach his work today, it is perhaps better to begin with a
bunch of flowers than with learned texts. At the same time it is
necessary to add that he was one of the least naive, least emotional
painters in the history of European art.</TE>
<TE>   Let me give two examples of how this search for an architectonic
unity works in practice and is visible in his paintings. First
example. A fresco of the Pregnant Madonna painted for a very small
chapel in the village of Monterchi, Umbria, where the painter's
mother came from. It is, as far as I know--although I may be
wrong--the only painted image of the Madonna as she would have been
toward the end of the ninth month of her pregnancy. Her dress is
unbuttoned because it is too tight over her belly, and with her right
hand she is loosening it further, whilst her left hand is undoing
another pleat of the dress at the side. Her head, held high and calm,
imagines another life, whilst all the buttons and laces of her
blue-green dress are being stretched apart. No wonder that during
generations, the chapel with this fresco was a place of pilgrimage in
central Italy for pregnant women, or for women who wanted to become
pregnant. On either side of the Madonna, two angels' draw back the
curtains of a tent in which the three of them are standing.</TE>
<TE>   Everything in the painting--the tent, the three dresses, the
angels' wings--is about vertical folds being parted to make an
opening, a vent. One recalls how the flutes of a column arc trot
straight but slightly curved, and how a vagina distends. All this in
the utmost calm within a time scale which allows us to remember that
feathers (the angels' wings) and human hair (the curls around their
faces) once had a common origin. The famous aura of calm which often
emanates from pregnant women has a lot to do with a time scale which
one might qualify as geological. When I was recently drawing my
daughter, who is eight months pregnant, I had the sense of drawing an
intricate, long coastline facing a sea far out at low tide.</TE>
<TE>   The second example is a fresco in the San Francesco Church in
Arezzo of the Queen of Sheba Adoring the Wood Cross. Horses. Two
horsemen. The Queen of Sheba on her knees. Her attendants standing
behind her. Two olive trees. In the background the hills of Umbria.
Parts of the fresco ruined by time.</TE>
<TE>   The drapery of the women's dresses trailing on the ground have a
geological timelessness. A tree's trunk lends its name to a man's
torso. The bones of a horse's legs recognize those of a man's. The
tree branches stretch like arms, the leaves move like fingers. The
ladies-in-waiting wait for the Queen of Sheba to finish her prayer,
and under their long dresses, fluted like columns, it is the month of
July. The same month that you can read in the colors of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   This book is cheap as art books go. There are postcard-like
reproductions of all the important paintings. It's a nice format,
like a road map. And it's called "The Piero Della Francesca Trail."
From the short texts you will learn a lot. Aldous Huxley called Della
Francesca's "Resurrection" "the best picture in the world" in 1920
when Della Francesca's oeuvre was just being rediscovered after
centuries of neglect. John Pope-Hennessy remains a Renaissance
scholar of great erudition.</TE>
<TE>   I would add just one word of warning. Don't be infected or
affected by the writers' snobbery and elitism; these weaknesses were,
until recently, endemic to most English art studies. Art was
considered to be essentially the property of gentlemen! Gentlemen who
would not identify with pregnant pilgrims, and who would prefer to
ignore how sweat runs down all torsos in July.</TE>

<DH>PEOPLE'S WITNESS: The Journalist in Modern Politics, By
Fred Inglis, Yale University Press: 416 pp., $29.95 * THE FIRST
CASUALTY: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker From the
Crimea to Kosovo, By Phillip Knightley, Johns Hopkins University
Press: 574 pp., $19.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT S. BOYNTON</AU>
<BD>Robert S. Boynton directs the graduate magazine
journalism program at New York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who fears that 25 years of postmodern relativism has pickled
the brains of today's youth has never taught introductory journalism.
On the first day of class when I greet my students (whether graduate
or undergraduate), the only thing I can be sure they believe in is
the absolute distinction between "facts" and "values"--the latter
having a corrupting effect on the former, which is the sole terrain
of "objective" journalism. "It's all relative" isn't a phrase I hear
very often.</LD>
<TE>   Journalism has never been a particularly philosophical discipline.
The relative absence of theoretical curiosity has spared it the
endless methodological squabbles that are the very stuff of, say,
sociology. But this absence has similarly inhibited it from
formulating the fundamental moral and political questions that should
be posed periodically of any human endeavor. What is journalism for?
To whom is it responsible? It is a happy coincidence that Fred
Inglis' "People's Witness: The Journalist in Modern Politics" and an
updated edition of Phillip Knightley's classic history of war
journalism, "The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and
Myth-Maker From the Crimea to Kosovo" appear this month. Both pose
versions of the above questions and outline competing arguments for
the proper relationship between journalism and politics. Inglis is
optimistic that journalism might have a positive cumulative influence
on politics. Knightley is thoroughly pessimistic about the media's
efficacy in the post-Vietnam era. "The lies, manipulation, news
management, propaganda, spin, distortion, omission, slant and
gullibility of the coverage of this war," he writes of Kosovo, " ...
has brought war correspondents to crisis point in their short
history."</TE>
<TE>   A professor of cultural studies at England's University of
Sheffield, Inglis is the author of a biography of Raymond Williams
(one of his discipline's founders), an impressionistic history of the
Cold War, "The Cruel Peace," and "Cultural Studies," one of the most
intelligent accounts of the discipline's rise in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   His sensibility is philosophical and anthropological, his method
biographical and anecdotal. They come together in his argument that
"[t]he myths of journalism, like those of any other trade, live in
the historical biographies which, taken together, compose the
ensemble of narratives constituting a culture."</TE>
<TE>   Inglis' argument that narrative is the currency of human
interaction resonates with the work of thinkers such as
anthropologist Clifford Geertz, philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre and,
most recently, psychologist Jerome Bruner, whose "Making Stories"
underscores narrative's role in organizing every aspect of knowledge
and life.</TE>
<TE>   For these scholars, culture is an ensemble of symbolic narratives,
which we argue about to create our traditions and forge our
character. Inglis dubs journalists "the people's storytellers,"
arguing that "journalism is the everyday domestic conversation of a
society as it first devises, disputes and circulates those
stories--as it tries out their grip." Journalism is thoroughly
social, providing "a kind of cognitive and sociable furniture upon
which readers can temporarily sit themselves down in terms of
history, geography, politics and passion."</TE>
<TE>   "People's Witness" is particularly timely because journalists
today are experiencing a crisis of narrative. There is a sense that
the message has overwhelmed the medium. "The breakup of former
Yugoslavia, the attempted secessions of parts of Indonesia and Sri
Lanka, the inexplicable civil wars of central Africa, above all the
hideous destruction of New York's World Trade Center, all offer
recent examples of political news which journalists struggled
helplessly to explain; they could only describe what they saw."
Inglis and Knightley would argue over whether political journalism
has been more diminished by profiteering media monopolies or onerous
government censorship, but they'd agree that the trade is in dire
need of reform.</TE>
<TE>   Though neither author offers anything resembling a concrete
"program" for rehabilitating political journalism, Inglis' cultural
studies background infuses "People's Witness" with a subtlety that is
missing from "The First Casualty." An award-winning investigative
journalist who wrote for London's Sunday Times for 20 years,
Knightley writes the history of the war correspondent as a story of
steady decline--in freedom, in objectivity, in balance. The three new
chapters on the Falkland Islands, Desert Storm and Kosovo are so
infected with the author's extreme anti-American political views (I
shudder to think of his opinion of the current conflict) that he
attacks the media's (admittedly dismal) performance as a proxy for
government policy he dislikes. Nearly every chapter--World War I,
World War II, Korea--concludes with a lament. "It's humiliating to
look back at what we wrote during the war," Knightley quotes a
Reuters reporter at the end of World War II. "... It wasn't good
journalism. It wasn't journalism at all."</TE>
<TE>   Really? All of it? Although no Pollyanna, Inglis resists
Knightley's relentless pessimism. In fact, "People's Witness" may be
read as a respectful critique of "The First Casualty" as Inglis
points out the "square simplicity of ... Knightley's approach to
journalistic ethics," and the exaggerated attention Inglis thinks he
gives to "the earnestness and uncontested objectivity which every
journalist should bring to the task of telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   For Inglis, "journalism is a branch of literature as history ...
and will only be truthful so far as it is well written."
"Truthfulness," rather than objectivity is the goal of political
journalism. Those he admires--Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, Harold
Evans, Jonathan Schell, I.F. Stone, David Halberstam, Ryszard
Kapuscinski and a long list of others--"match the magic of their gift
for words against the vast possibility of what may be made from those
little fictions, the facts. When the writers win, the match is a
draw. This is called balance," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas "objectivity" is an accolade drawn from the world of
science, truthfulness is a thoroughly human virtue. Whether
chronicling the tradition of the British radical press or of American
muckraking ("it set a seal on the constitution of journalism"),
Inglis detects a resilient, if embattled, continuum. In "People's
Witness," he fashions an alternative tradition of political
journalism as he reorders "a galaxy of starring and not-so-starring,
more dimly significant names in a new historical constellation."</TE>
<TE>   But whose account is more accurate? Is political journalism a
tradition of stubborn, occasionally successful, truth-tellers, as
Inglis would have it? Or an endless parade of the easily duped, as
Knightley suggests?</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, it may not matter. "The military and the American and
British governments realised from their polls that the public knew
that the news from the Gulf was being censored--and almost eighty per
cent thought that this was a good idea," writes Knightley. "In fact,
nearly sixty per cent thought that the authorities should exert more
control over the coverage of the war." If truth is the first casualty
of war, it seems that the public's desire for it runs a close second.</TE>

<HD>Armed and Dangerous</HD>
<DH>LONE PATRIOT: The Short Career of an American Militiaman,
By Jane Kramer, Pantheon: 260 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES COATES</AU>
<BD>James Coates is the author of several books, including
"Armed and Dangerous: The Rise of the Survivalist Right." He is a
computer columnist with the Chicago Tribune.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When an elitist panders to the quaint natives of some far-flung
precinct, the practice goes by many names, including "patronizing"
and "slumming." Such terms come to mind after picking up Jane
Kramer's "Lone Patriot," the story of John Pitner, late of the
Washington State Militia as its leader and later still of the U.S.
federal penitentiary system as a resident.</LD>
<LD>   A National Book Award winner and a star writer of the "Letter From
Europe" for the New Yorker, Kramer most certainly does "get" Pitner,
who was accused in 1997 of plotting, with others, a war against the
federal government, although a conviction on a lesser charge led to
his imprisonment. She gets what he was about, from the top of his
Christian Patriot's head to the tips of his anti-Semitic jackboots.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Kramer had to do a lot of slumming to write this book:
Imagine somebody with Kramer's credentials keeping company with the
slack-jawed, lowbrow crowd of rural militia zealots and their women
who populate the pages of "Lone Patriot." Anybody with a minimum of
common sense and a modicum of human decency wouldn't be slumming with
Pitner's crowd of gun-toting extremists who fear having government
computer chips installed in their hind ends.</LD>
<TE>   But Kramer did hang out with these people, and, in "Lone Patriot,"
she gives readers what may be the most important book written about
America's curious and very dangerous survivalist right-wing movement.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer documents how this universe of small-town paranoids,
backwoods anti-Semites and government-hating welfare recipients from
such bizarre fringe groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and
the Christian Identity group find their way ever closer to the
American mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   This happens, she shows, as the relatively small survivalist hate
movement's politics get adopted by the far more populous militia
crowds in rural America. Upon reading "Lone Patriot," one learns how
the militia, also calling itself the Patriot movement, strikes an
appealing chord for many rural Americans who come into conflict with
the system as school dropouts and chronically unemployed laborers,
and who bristle with hatred at those who prosper in a system that
baffles them.</TE>
<TE>   As a perpetually unemployed housepainter, Pitner is a storybook
rural American loser. He stood out among the good people of Whatcom
County, Wash., because he had a flair for public speaking and because
he did enough homework to learn the Patriot spiel from such masters
of backwoods oration and populist manipulation as John Trochmann, the
glib and notorious leader of the Militia of Montana who mentored
Pitner and turned him into yet another recruiter for the ill-starred
Patriot movement.</TE>
<TE>   Based on interviews with Pitner, his wife and a string of
shirttail relatives, Kramer traces the Pitner saga during the
mid-1990s as he became obsessed with the delusion that federal forces
were stalking him and as he spread that paranoia among his neighbors.
Kramer says she spent most of a year in Whatcom County and even made
friends with some of the people there.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer relates how the Patriots developed a well-honed sales pitch
that lets leaders like Trochmann make a living selling hate
literature, military supplies and tchotchkes such as Ku Klux Klan
salt and pepper shakers and "Don't Tread on Me" flags to their
friends and neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   It's fascinating to follow Pitner as he performs his duties, like
any pyramid sales operator holding parties to sell do-it-yourself law
forms instead of Tupperware. He tells Kramer that he started with
$600 worth of military intelligence data he bought from Trochmann and
parlayed it into at least a living wage for a few years as he built
his Washington State Militia.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer's literary treatments of the zealots of Whatcom County
reminds one of John Steinbeck's artful creation of ne'er-do-well guys
and gals in "Cannery Row" and "Tortilla Flat." They're wacky and even
carry a certain dignity as they prepare for the United Nations tanks
about to pour over the Canadian border. There is old Doc Ellwanger,
the beloved town veterinarian who would stay up all night nursing an
ill 4-H Club lamb but who wanted to kill the Jews in the Federal
Reserve bank.</TE>
<TE>   Pitner's wife, Debbie, is a rough-hewn, ax-swinging ranch woman
who somehow got past a teenage bout with drug abuse and a fling with
Pitner at 13 that hardly sounds romantic. Debbie Pitner wasn't all
that taken with Patriot mumbo jumbo, but she was glad to see that
John had created a paying job for himself and had stopped sitting
around the house brooding about worldwide conspiracies and
establishing a Patriot colony in outer space.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbeck-quaint as they are, the people in Kramer's book went too
far around the bend and bought into hate. Kramer speculates that, if
these rural misfits lived in cities instead of idyllic countrysides,
some would wind up in street gangs. They certainly would have a
difficult time on the streets of Los Angeles, Chicago or New York,
however, convincing passersby that there is a massive Jewish
conspiracy afoot to trick white people into breeding with people of
color to produce a race of "mud people": semi-humans who will serve
their Hebrew-speaking banker masters as soon as the U.N. completes
installing the New World Order in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To Kramer's great credit she also finds fault with the overzealous
FBI agents and other law enforcement people who came down hard on
Pitner in the wake of the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City, when they hit him and six others with a raft of
illegal weapons and conspiracy charges as part of a nationwide
crackdown on militias.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer makes it clear that, although Pitner talked to undercover
agents about plans to wreak havoc on federal targets, he was
essentially a deluded liar and a blowhard rather than a dangerous
criminal. Indeed, his jury deadlocked against conspiracy charges, and
Pitner ultimately spent four years in jail on a single illegal
weapons count. Kramer reports that Pitner left federal custody last
year and moved back to Bellingham, Wash., to be near his relatives.
She ends the book there, not thinking that he would resume his
militia activities, though who can say if she's right about that?
Only time will tell.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson one takes from this superbly written story is how
quickly and casually the easygoing people of Whatcom County accepted,
and even followed, this deluded braggart spewing the same old drivel
that has been promulgated at America's grass-roots at least since
Henry Ford had his dealerships distribute the notorious forgery, "The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in the 1920s. If John Pitner really
were just a "Lone Patriot," this would be a far better world. But
Kramer's probing of the rural psyche shows that a great many Patriots
are waiting in heartland America for someone among them who will rise
up and strike.</TE>

<HD>Made for Marriage</HD>
<DH>STRAND OF A THOUSAND PEARLS: A Novel, By Dorit Rabinyan,
Random House: 288 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERICA DA COSTA</AU>
<BD>Erica Da Costa is a writer whose reviews have appeared
in the New York Times Book Review and the Washington Post Book World.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorit Rabinyan made her debut at the age of 22 with "Persian Brides,"
a novel about two girls growing up in the Jewish quarter of a 15th
century Persian village. Her second novel, "Strand of a Thousand
Pearls," flows over readers like the first with scents and aromas,
textures and tastes. This time the emanations are from a present-day
Persian family in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Rabinyan loosely structures her novel as a patchwork of
marriage-narratives in which the five Azizyan children are born,
raised and married. Much as tradition dictates, the Azizyan family
matriarch, named Iran, has determined that matrimony is the reason
and goal for her children's lives. But the consequences of a
marriage-oriented existence prove to be quietly devastating,
exacerbated by the 20th century epidemic of romantic love that has
spread like viral madness through the very foundations of culture,
infecting even the most practical of institutions, marriage.</LD>
<LD>   Reality ravages the Azizyan children's marital fantasies.
Marcelle, for example, spends seven years obsessing about a young man
she has never spoken to. She marries him only to discover, on her
wedding night, that she does not want him at all. The marriage
stories overlap and weave together in a rich pattern that resembles a
parable or family legend.</LD>
<TE>   Rabinyan does something particularly interesting with the voice of
the narrator, which is primarily an invisible third-person observer.
Almost imperceptibly, her narration slips into the first person. Each
member of the Azizyan family is referred to by name, but the five
children are occasionally referred to collectively as "us." The
narrator descends into the narrative but refuses to become a specific
character. Who is this "we" that the narrator reveals but never
explains? Does it refer to Persian Israelis, the Middle East,
womankind, humankind? Perhaps the narrator is the collective soul of
Iran's children. The novel is so fecund as to allow many meanings.</TE>
<TE>   Rabinyan's story is, above all, about women: from Iran, who comes
from a distant time and place, to her youngest daughter Matti, a wild
unbalanced creature whose Ritalin-popping habit brings us to a
distinctively modern moment. The prose seethes with metaphor and
overwhelming lyricism: "Of all of us, Marcelle was the one whom Papa
knew really well. They met at dawn, the coldest hour of the
twenty-four, when souls rub against each other to keep warm, and seek
comfort, by becoming acquainted."</TE>
<TE>   "Strand of a Thousand Pearls" is less a story than a portrait of a
family caught at the intersection of the ancient and the
contemporary. The Azizyan family seems at once mythological and
horribly real, their rich cultural milieu debased by hard realities
like plastic photo albums and special-needs classes for disturbed
children. Rabinyan is less concerned with plumbing the depths of
individual psyches than with capturing the spirit of a people, and in
this she succeeds.</TE>

<HD>Just How Sick Is Our Economy?</HD>
<DH>THE BOOM AND THE BUBBLE: The U.S. in the World Economy, By
Robert Brenner, Verso: 294 pp. $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>James Flanigan is The Times business columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the dot-com bubble burst in a cascade of bankruptcies in
2001, there has been a running debate over the "new economy." Was all
the talk about information technology transforming industry and
society real, or was it hype? Are we living through an economic
revolution or simply another cycle on the old boom-bust roller
coaster?</LD>
<LD>   "The Boom and the Bubble" says the boom was more than hype but
less than a lasting turn in the economy. In that respect, Robert
Brenner offers a more scholarly analysis of the recent decade than
most commentators who tend to overpraise or dismiss recent
technological innovations. The merits of this latest ride
notwithstanding, he concludes with the gloomy speculation that the
United States is headed into another phase of the long economic
downturn that he argues has held the world's capitalist economies in
its grip since 1973, and that "a U.S. recession will set off an
international recession." It is an unsettling prediction that may be
premature.</LD>
<LD>   If Brenner is right and the world is headed for serious recession,
adequate returns on retirement savings may not be possible. That
would mean living standards would not rise and aging Americans would
have to postpone retirement. It would mean that poor countries would
be stunted in development, and that the disorder of such developing
regions as the Middle East would be exacerbated, not alleviated.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Brenner, who completed his book before Sept. 11, was not able
to factor into his analysis greater military spending by the United
States, the recent shift to deficit spending, the re-entry of Russia
to full participation in the global economy and other changes. It is
nonetheless a prediction that demands our attention.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner believes that the rising rate of productivity in the
1990s, which was at the center of the boom, was genuine, but no
greater than the economy's performance in a similar period of the
great upturn, 1948 to 1973. (Productivity is the achievement of more
output from the same or less investment of labor or capital.) The
post-World War II era, he writes, saw a historic advance in
productivity in the U.S. economy. However, that period was followed
by a long downturn--from 1973 to roughly the mid-1990s--in profit and
productivity in the United States and other capitalist economies.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner writes that the long downturn era to which the United
States is returning may be the permanent state of the world's
capitalist economies, saddled as they are with overcapacity to
produce goods and lack of ability to produce profit and fresh funds
for investment by the makers of those goods. He questions whether the
vitality of the mid- to late-1990s--when profit and growth of real
wages did better than they had done in the previous 20 years--"can be
maintained over the medium to long term."</TE>
<TE>   It's a good, if commonplace, question that has been asked
before--during the great post-World War II upturn, during the
downturn of 1958 and during the turbulent 1960s--and it runs against
the predictions of those, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who have said repeatedly that, because of new
technologies, industries are capable of increasing productivity more
than they could historically.</TE>
<TE>   But we won't know who is right for some time, Greenspan with his
optimism about technology or Brenner with his skepticism.
Productivity figures may have risen in the first quarter of 2002 but
the numbers are something of an illusion, attributed to employers
reducing their work forces, lowering investment and wringing more
output from those fewer workers. It is a scenario that fits nicely
into Brenner's thesis.</TE>
<TE>   However, Brenner keeps a narrow focus on economic data, and "The
Boom and the Bubble" seldom mentions issues of the changing world in
the last 60 years that offer different and pertinent perspectives. In
that way, the book shares the weaknesses of other economic analyses
that have seen the world through a narrow prism. The 1990s produced
hymns to progress, such as "The Long Boom" and "Dow 36,000," as well
as prophesies of doom, such as "The Crash of the Millennium." The
world is more complex than such books make it out to be, and so is
the immense U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   First, the great upturn starting in 1948 followed more than a
decade of Depression and half a decade of world war. Investment in
military technology during that war and in the military-industrial
complex during the Cold War changed the world and the position of the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner almost never refers to military spending as the foundation
for the U.S. economy, but surely it has been one. To take one
example, defense research spending led in 1958 to the development of
the integrated circuit, the more capable transistor that is at the
heart of every machine used today. Such circuitry made possible
smarter machines in factories, not only in the United States but
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the transformation of nations such as South Korea is
responsible for the overproduction of industrial goods that Brenner
believes has weakened U.S. economic prospects. But, in reality, the
development of South Korea's economy from one of subsistence farming
to a main center of highly skilled industry has expanded the global
economy, with opportunities for the United States to make markets in
education, computer and telecommunications software, medical science,
entertainment and other areas of modern life. Also, South Korea,
which endured the first shooting war of the Cold War era, provides a
footnote to contemporary history. It was the industrial advances of
South Korea that convinced Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in the
1980s that the Soviet Union had to reform its planned economic
system.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the long downturn that began in the 1970s resulted from
many complications flowing from the Vietnam War, which cost the U.S.
economy a surplus of national wealth that had built up in the
post-World War II era.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Vietnam, business in the 1970s lacked capital
for investment, inflation beset the economy and the pension
investment funds that had grown to include the stock of most public
companies were unable to make adequate returns. The pension funds'
need for higher returns on investment were then a major factor
pushing corporations in the 1980s to "restructure" and earn higher
profits. The investment bankers and financial capitalists that
Brenner cites were the agents of economic changes, but not the causes
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Third, the 1990s followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
communist economies in Russia and its neighboring countries. The U.S.
defense budget declined, and technologies, such as the Internet and
high-speed communications, initially developed for the military, came
into use in the civilian economy. The result was a spread of cellular
telephones, of satellite broadcasting and tracking of freight
movements. Sensors developed for military use have led to important
capabilities in monitoring of the heart and other vital organs.</TE>
<TE>   Something else happened in the late 1990s boom that Brenner
doesn't factor into his argument: The U.S. economy grew comparatively
larger than all others. In 1995, the domestic economy was about 60%
larger than that of Japan. Today the U.S. economy is larger than the
combined economies of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Italy.
Brenner sees this imbalance as unstable and a threat to continued
prosperity. But it is unstable only if other countries do not develop
and provide markets for U.S. output of technology and knowledge. And
returns are not yet in on that question.</TE>
<TE>   With a careful and statistic-filled examination of profit ratios
and economic returns, Brenner has written something of a thriller
with a to-be-continued ending. Which outcome will it be? Very likely
a muddling-through amalgam of upturns followed by downturns, followed
by.... That's the cyclical pattern of the 50-odd years covered in
"The Boom and the Bubble." And there's little doubt it will continue.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED HALLIDAY</AU>
<BD>Fred Halliday is the author of numerous books,
including "Nation and Religion in the Middle East," "The World at
2000" and "Two Hours That Shook the World: 11 September 2001, Causes
and Consequences."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last nine months have been a time of questions in the West: Who
carried out the attacks of Sept. 11, what were their motives,
ideologies and expectations, and what may the future bring?
"Terrorism," a convenient term for identifying some of the issues
involved, is one answer. But something else--history, social and
political analysis, an understanding of the uses and misuses of
texts, symbols, traditions--is also needed that moves the discussion
beyond Manhattan and into the countries where anger and violence have
been maturing for several decades.</LD>
<LD>   To that task Gilles Kepel, Tariq Ali and John L. Esposito make
their informative contributions. Each writes in a particular
register: Kepel as a French specialist on fundamentalism in many
countries; Ali as a Pakistani critic of fundamentalism and the United
States; and Esposito as an American committed to the better
understanding of faiths. What their books provide is an analysis of a
religion and culture that is diverse and in conflict with itself.</LD>
<TE>   Kepel has followed the development of political Islam for 20
years, beginning with a study of the Egyptian militants who
assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981 and on through the spread
of Islamic radicalism in the 1980s and 1990s to Algeria, Afghanistan
and Turkey. The terror attacks of last year, he believes, are not the
result of a rising Islamic force but are the desperate act of a
radical Islam that is in decline.</TE>
<TE>   Kepel has a fine eye for the ways in which appeals to a radical
Islam identity and to the solidarity of a broad community, or Umma,
embracing all Muslims are offset by more mundane forces. Thus it was
the rivalry of two states, Iran and Saudi Arabia, that dominated
politicized Islam, or "Islamism," in the 1980s. In the 1990s, for all
the rhetoric and fighting, it was the existing regimes that prevailed
over religious protest: The radical movements failed to achieve their
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly in Egypt and Algeria, militant groups were contained; in
Turkey, where Islamism took an electoral form, the government of
Necmettin Erbakan was dismissed by the military; in Iran, 20 years of
the mullahs in power has led to widespread disillusionment with the
appeals of political Islam; in Sudan, the Islamist regime became
another military dictatorship; in its main European venture, Bosnia,
fundamentalism failed to capture the embattled new republic.</TE>
<TE>   And then came last year's tragic events. In Afghanistan the
population, far from embracing the jihadi internationalists who had
provoked a confrontation with America, turned on them, denouncing
Arabs and Pakistanis for ruining their country. In the Muslim world
at large, Islamic internationalism and appeals to the Umma to rise up
yielded little despite considerable sympathy for the attacks on
America, as there was in the non-Muslim Third World, and little
substantial or organized support for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a wave of the future, Kepel concludes political
Islam is on the retreat; the resort to violence by extremist groups
is a sign of desperation and frustration, not of some victorious,
mobilizing advance. "In spite of what many hasty commentators
contended in its immediate aftermath," Kepel writes, "the attack on
the United States was a desperate symbol of the isolation,
fragmentation, and decline of the Islamist movement, not a sign of
its strength and irrepressible might."</TE>
<TE>   Kepel, Ali and Esposito describe the diversity of Muslim
traditions and interpretations; it is a far cry from the perception
of Islam as monolithic, something that fundamentalists also claim.
Ali, for example, through his reading of early Islamic history and
philosophy, locates the flexible, skeptical, hedonistic traditions
within Islamic thinking, ones picked up by liberals such as Muhammad
Iqbal in India and Arab liberal thinkers, whom the fundamentalists
wish to silence.</TE>
<TE>   Ali too puts considerable emphasis on the fact that, in
contemporary Islamic culture, the great power is not religious
solidarity, as the West might believe, but nationalism, most evident
in the massacre of East Pakistani Bengalis by West Pakistani Punjabis
and Sindhis in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Esposito traces the origins of fundamentalism to medieval Islamic
thinkers such as the champion of Sunni orthodoxy, Ibn Taimiya
(1268-1328). He also shows how text and tradition allow for
different, more liberal, interpretations in contemporary times: The
Malayan Anwar Ibrahim, Mohammad Khatami in Iran and the former
president of Indonesia Abdurrahman Wahid are three examples of voices
calling for reform and recognizing, as Esposito says, "the strengths
and weaknesses of Western-style modernity."</TE>
<TE>   But the face of Islam that many of us have become accustomed to is
that of Osama bin Laden, whose ideology can be traced from key
radical modern thinkers who turned against liberal Islam as they
turned against secular forces in their own society. Hassan al-Banna
(died in 1949), founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 1928,
provided a model of a new militant political organization. Mawlana
Maududi (died in 1979) founded the Jamaat-i-Islami (the Islamic
Society), the core of what was to be Pakistani fundamentalism, in
1941. He proposed the reestablishment of the unity of all Muslims and
a jihad against secularism and Western ideology.</TE>
<TE>   But, as these three books suggest, the Islamic thinker of most
proximate importance for Bin Laden and many of his associates is
Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser
in 1966. He denounced all in the West as jahiliya, a Koranic term for
"ignorance," and proposed in his programmatic book "Milestones" the
creation of a hard, militant organization refusing all negotiation
that would confront this enemy.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet Communism had tried to use radical
Muslim sentiment against Western colonialism. From the 1950s it was
the other way: Saudi Arabia and later other regimes such as Pakistan
and Iran sought to mobilize popular sentiment against communism and
nationalism by promoting Islam. In this they were encouraged by the
U.S., which went on to wage its largest covert operation in support
of the Afghan jihad. Those who were encouraged by the West to fight
communism in the 1980s turned, after the war with Iraq in 1990-91, to
oppose the U.S. Within the Arab states most closely allied with the
West, in particular Saudi Arabia, a movement of social unrest,
directed at corruption and at collusion with Western policy, also
increased.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s three issues had fused into one angry cause:
Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan. Attacks on Western targets began in
1993 and, in February 1998, the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders was established, with Al Qaeda as one of its
components, laying down in its rhetoric the claim to a militant
opposition across west Asia. For all the resort to tradition, there
was much that was new here: When Bin Laden invoked Muslim resistance
to the Crusades, he made an allusion that until recently had meant
little to most Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, signs of an enduring crisis, one that will engulf
many Muslim countries, are more visible. Afghanistan has been freed
from the Taliban, and the transitional process occurring there has
some chance of success. Elsewhere, however, the crises endure:
Kashmir remains unresolved, with India and Pakistan no nearer
accommodation; there will, in all likelihood, be a major
confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq; Israelis and Palestinians
are at war, with popular anger on both sides such that, even were
some cease-fire or agreement negotiated, it is improbable it would
last.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, after an interlude of reflection and some good sense,
wild generalizations about Islam and the West are gaining ground in
the West and East. On all sides there is less understanding, less
willingness to listen.</TE>
<TE>   In all of this, and despite Kepel's argument as to the limited
appeal of radical Islam, it would appear naive to believe that a
fundamental clarification of issues or of historical causes has taken
place. We can explore, in the past and the present of the Muslim
world, many ways in which more open, liberal, democratic
interpretations are possible: But amid what is a pervasive sense of
nationalist anger, and where the outcome of rival interpretation will
be decided by those who have power, more open, tolerant variants will
be on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many problems underlying this story, there are three
that are particularly discomforting. One concerns the sources of
political violence: These are deep and persistent, and even if Kepel
is right about the limited mass appeal of Al Qaeda, others with
equally limited appeal may try to replicate, if not outbid, Sept. 11.
The second problem is that of responsibility for what happened:
Post-Sept. 11 indignation and commitment to fighting terrorism cannot
obliterate the degree to which Western countries played, during the
Cold War, a role in fostering violent groups in Afghanistan and
elsewhere. In this regard, patriotic denial and a careless use of the
term "terrorism" are no escape.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the question of how far it makes sense, in any
context, to try to combine religion with political life; whether, in
other words, there is an alternative to secularism in the modern
world. At the moment, those who oppose radical Islam often do so with
other religious idioms, be it that of Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism
or liberal variants of Islam itself. Given the uses to which religion
and culture are put, one can only wonder if this will not compound
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Clash of Fundamentalisms'</TE>
<TE>   I never really believed in God. Not even for a week, not even
between the ages of six and ten, when I was an agnostic. This
unbelief was instinctive. I was sure there was nothing else out there
except space. It could have been my lack of imagination. During the
sweet, jasmine-scented summer nights, long before mosques were
allowed to use loud-speakers, it was enough to savor the silence,
look upwards at the exquisitely lit sky, count the shooting stars and
fall asleep. The early morning call of the muezzin was like a
pleasant-</TE>
<TE>   sounding alarm clock.</TE>
<TE>   There were many advantages in being an unbeliever.</TE>

<HD>LETTER FROM DANA POINT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CYNTHIA HAVEN</AU>
<BD>Cynthia Haven writes for a number of publications,
including The Washington Post and the San Jose Mercury News. A
somewhat different version of her essay appeared in the (London)
Times Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Casa Dana, a 1920s Spanish-style dwelling surrounded by a
stucco-and-wrought-iron wall, overlooks a hundred-foot cliff, a
white-sand beach and the limitless Pacific. Nothing could be less
evocative of Moscow's grimy brick apartment blocks or St.
Petersburg's gray crumbling facades.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the connection is an intimate one. Casa Dana has long been the
home of Ardis Publishers. Prior to glasnost, the preeminent publisher
of modern Russian literature was based not in Leningrad or Moscow,
but here, in suburban America. Ardis was the largest publishing house
anywhere devoted exclusively to Russian literature.</LD>
<LD>   The competition was admittedly limited: Soviet publishers were
hamstrung in what they could print; they weren't publishing much that
was new, let alone groundbreaking. The emigre YMCA press in Paris
(which published Solzhenitsyn, among others) and Possev in Germany
had a religious or political bent, a bias that often alienated
younger writers. Samizdat was one alternative: haphazard, handwritten
or mimeographed, and highly perishable.</LD>
<TE>   Then there was Ardis. With its related venture, the innovative
Russian Literature Triquarterly, Ardis brought Western readers to
Russian writers. Marina Tsvetaeva, Osip Mandelstam, Paul Klebnikov,
Mikahil Bulgakov, even Anna Akhmatova were relatively little known in
the era before Ardis set up shop; their works were suppressed, their
names and reputations were inevitably jumbled with a plethora of
lesser, officially approved writers. Ardis provided quality
translations.</TE>
<TE>   Originally founded in 1971 in Ann Arbor, Mich., Ardis moved to
Dana Point, the land of lush palm trees, oleander, birds of paradise
and ubiquitous jasmine--at the end of El Camino Capistrano--in 1994,
and its acquisition in April by New York's Overlook Press provides a
literary Cold War coda. Overlook hopes to reissue a number of
out-of-print Ardis titles, and perhaps add new ones to address the
emerging sensibility of 21st century Russia. Whatever the future, the
change of ownership marks the end of an era for the publishing
venture that, according to the late Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, had
an impact on Russian literature second only to the advent of the
printing press.</TE>
<TE>   Ardis' story has been inextricably bound up with the energy and
enthusiasm of its founders. Carl Proffer, then a 32-year-old
professor at the University of Michigan, a specialist in the works of
Nikolai Gogol and Vladimir Nabokov, and his 26-year-old wife,
Ellendea, an assistant professor in Russian and a Mikhail Bulgakov
scholar, began the venture almost as a lark.</TE>
<TE>   The Proffers had visited Russia in 1969 on a Fulbright fellowship,
with a letter of introduction to Nadezhda Mandelstam, widow of the
poet Osip. After that enviable entree, the Proffers hobnobbed with
the Russian intelligentsia. When they received a rare, pre-revolution
edition of Mandelstam's early collection, "Stone"--one of only 50
left, according to collectors--they had their first book. When Elena
Sergeevna Bulgakova gave them an unpublished 1935 version of
Bulgakov's "Zoya's Apartment," they had their second.</TE>
<TE>   The Proffers launched Ardis and the journal Russian Literature
Triquarterly in 1971 with $3,000 borrowed from Carl's bewildered
parents. Ardis' first office was the bedroom of their cramped Ann
Arbor townhouse. Not supported by academic or government subsidies,
they quickly piled up a sizable debt and a stack of news clippings.
International fame came within a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Proffers, friends of Brodsky since 1969, were visiting
Leningrad in 1972 when the authorities ordered the 32-year-old poet
out of the USSR. Carl offered Brodsky a poet-in-residence position at
the University of Michigan. Brodsky had never taught a class in his
life; his poetry was largely unknown, and his English was garbled and
virtually incomprehensible. Proffer pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   By 1976, Ardis had achieved a measure of success, enough to
relocate the Proffers to the erstwhile Huron Hills Country Club, a
rambling, ramshackle, 24-room residence, also from the 1920s, which
in the winter was whimsically reminiscent of a dacha. The
cream-colored living room with its large picture windows, a former
ballroom, was the scene of all-night Ardis mailings where
translators, friends and graduate students stuffed envelopes on the
beige carpet, paid only with pizza and Coca-Cola.</TE>
<TE>   The basement, however, was the heart of the Ardis operation,
heralded by a memorable poster, "Russian Literature Is Better Than
Sex," and dominated by a Cyrillic cold-type composing machine.
Outspoken, savvy Ellendea was the perfect foil for the tall, genial,
soft-spoken Carl, a former basketball player. She is Irish American;
he was a son of the American prairies. Their motive was not ethnicity
but an exuberant love of Russian literature.</TE>
<TE>   Ellendea's keen intelligence and keener tongue have not diminished
with the passage of a quarter-century. Her conversation is peppered
with gossip, anecdotes and snippets of Ardis history. In one moment
she recalls smuggling the Hite Report, Bibles and issues of
Cosmopolitan to the 80-year-old Madame Mandelstam, at the widow's
request; in another, how she and Carl competed with each other to
read the advance galleys of Nabokov's "Ada," forwarded from Playboy
magazine, via the diplomatic pouch, to the hotel they were staying at
in Leningrad.</TE>
<TE>   While in the Soviet Union, the Proffers were subjected to
surveillance, body searches and press attacks. Their Russian friends
were interrogated. Carl was finally banned from the USSR in 1979;
Ellendea in 1980. Carl never returned; he died of cancer in 1984, at
46. Brodsky said Carl Proffer "was simply an incarnation of all the
best things that humanity and being American represent."</TE>
<TE>   Insiders questioned whether Ellendea, a devastated widow with four
children, would be able to carry on; the business acumen, after all,
had been Carl's. Within a few years, however, Ellendea received a
stunning vote of confidence: She received a MacArthur Fellowship in
1989, Ardis' first external funding. A few months later, she made a
triumphant return to Russia and the Moscow Book Fair. The Soviet
government again tried to deny her a visa until other publishers at
the fair threatened to boycott.</TE>
<TE>   She remarried and moved to Dana Point. During the glasnost years,
Ardis emphasized Russian literature in translation. Ardis' last book
in Russian was Brodsky's final collection of poems, "Landscape With
Flood." Glasnost changed Ardis, but some claim Ardis had a role in
triggering glasnost, by forcing the hand of the Soviet literary
powers, who were put in the humiliating position of watching a couple
of eager Yanks shape and preserve its literary heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Some also claim that Ardis, directly or indirectly, established
the relative reputations of prominent Russian writers for Western
readers. It is hard to recall how few and far between even unreliable
translations were in the early 1970s; Western publishers simply
didn't think such translations were commercially viable. Moreover,
scholars and the public knew only the portion of Russian literature
that Soviet officials chose to dole out, and Ardis served as a
sorting table for determining the relative importance of various
names. In many instances, Ardis may have created the Western audience
that mainstream publishers were certain did not exist.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of the Ardis endeavor demonstrated the density and
richness of Russian culture in the last century. Publishing 40 to 50
titles a year, it took on tasks that were cumbersome and
unprofitable: Ardis was first to publish the five-volume complete
letters of Dostoevsky; it republished Nabokov's early Russian novels,
long out of print, then published the first Russian translations of
his English novels. How much Ardis was ahead of a wave, and how much
it created the wave, will be a subject for future scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ellendea is casting her lot in a different direction.
Her new publishing venture, Casa Dana, will focus on books about the
West Coast: "for my culture about my culture," she says. And as for
Russian publishing: "Now everyone has everything to read, and they
read trash. Just like us. Real national culture included writers
until recently. I'm not sure they're going to withstand the onslaught
of TV and movies. Like us. But there are signs of high culture
returning. It's still too early to say.... My conviction is that it
is a great and rich culture, a deep culture, and it will come back
again."</TE>
<TE>   As we walk along Dana Point's Cliff Walk, to the high pergola that
overlooks the Pacific, the height and the ocean breeze provide a
sun-bleached counterpoint to the day, 30 years ago, when the Proffers
conferred with Brodsky on the windy roof of Leningrad's grim Peter
and Paul Fortress, famous as a prison for Russian writers (Dostoevsky
and Gorky among them). That Leningrad is far away, in time, distance
and spirit. Leningrad has already entered the world of myth; the
Pacific Coast lives in another.</TE>
<TE>   We are within a few miles of the legendary old mission of San Juan
Capistrano, where the swallows return, miraculously, on St. Joseph's
Day every spring. Perhaps, in light of Ellendea's cautious hopes and
the proximity of Ardis for nearly a decade, it might not be too
frivolous to construe it as a very un-Russian omen of regeneration, a
harbinger of better times to come, always bearing in mind that
optimism comes perhaps too breezily here, on the other side of the
world.</TE>

<DH>CICERO: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician,
By Anthony Everitt, Random House: 362 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS VON HOFFMAN</AU>
<BD>Nicholas von Hoffman is the author of "We Are the
People Our Parents Warned Us Against," "Capitalist Fools: Tales of
American Business From Carnegie to Forbes to the Milken Gang" and
"Citizen Cohn."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you were to ask 99 out of 100 people on the streets of any
American city what the word "Cicero" conveys to them, they would
answer a town in Illinois, chiefly famous for once having been Al
Capone's headquarters. Nevertheless, before Cicero, sometimes
pronounced Kickero, was a suburb of Chicago, there was Marcus Tullius
Cicero, who flourished, as they used to say, between 106 and 43 BC.</LD>
<LD>   Time was when every American boy who attended an academic high
school (few girls went to such places) knew the name and something of
the life and works of this dead Roman. In the last half-century,
Cicero, the man whom the Enlightenment and the patres patriae (read
Founding Fathers) of the United States regarded as the defender of
republican government, liberty and constitutionalism in the ancient
world, has all but evaporated for the citizens of the American
democracy which he, at least in some small degree, inspired.</LD>
<TE>   But now comes Anthony Everitt to resurrect Cicero by writing a
modern biography of this unmodern man. It is no easy job he's taken
on. His work will be compared to that of earlier biographers who
didn't have the burden of attempting to sketch out the
interior/psychological life of the subject, as we like to do these
days and as Everitt takes some valiant stabs at. At the distance of
more than two millenniums, finding a soul is quite a job, even though
Cicero, in his philosophical works, devoted no little space to the
soul. But his soul was not that of modern psychology but of classical
stoicism, a very different soul indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Fiction may be a better medium for such long-distance
soul-searching. Robert Graves in "I, Claudius," and Thornton Wilder
in "The Ides of March" are vividly successful in depicting the souls
of two imperial Romans, but as novelists they don't have to play by
the rules that historian Everitt is obliged to obey. Those rules
leave him with just eight ancient authors as sources. Biographers of
the more recently departed sometimes find heretofore undiscovered
letters, diaries or papers. They may interview people previous
biographers have missed, but Everitt is stuck with using the same old
eight and reworking them for our contemporary sensibilities. Given
the handicaps, you have to say he does a decent job of it. By the
book's end, he's managed to put enough flesh on Cicero's old bones
that you care when the agents of his implacable enemy, Mark Antony,
kill him by chopping off his head and then cutting out his tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Cicero is the only figure in classical antiquity who might be
considered a subject for contemporary biographical treatment. Of all
the famous figures from that marbled age, his is the only personal
correspondence to come down to us. It is not complete, and there are
maddening gaps at critical moments, but there are still hundreds of
letters, many of which were written to Cicero's best friend, Atticus.
The letters are personal and contain Cicero's whiny complaints and
less than noble petty eccentricities.</TE>
<TE>   As if the lack of sources were not enough, Everitt has another
huge obstacle to surmount: the readers' ignorance of the world in
which Cicero lived. One might hazard that more than a few, even among
those who know Cicero was a person and not a suburb, don't know that
there was a Roman Republic. Wasn't it an empire with Nero and the
gladiators and people giving the stiff-armed salute to the emperor
and then leaping into a chariot and galloping off to feed a Christian
to the lions?</TE>
<TE>   Everitt says of his book that he will be happy "if I have
succeeded in showing, first how unrecognizably different the Roman
Republic was from ours ... the fact that the Romans ran a
sophisticated and complex state with practically none of the public
institutions we take for granted (a civil service, a police force and
so forth) and the impact of religious ritual on the conduct of public
affairs make ancient Rome a very strange place to modern eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Strange hardly encompasses it. To a present-day American, a
republic with two presidents serving simultaneously and three
legislative chambers is bordering on the weird. The danger Everitt
has to work his way around is making his biography a rather static
text, sketching the outlines of 1st century BC Roman society, if he
can only draw his reader into the book before he feeds them the dull
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Everitt begins his book with a lively and dramatic account
of the assassination of Julius Caesar as it was seen by Cicero, who
was in the senate house that famous day but was not part of the
conspiracy. After that, Everitt has no choice but to serve the dull
stuff, which readers must know if they are to make sense of this
man's life stories.</TE>
<TE>   It needs putting in the plural because there is Cicero, the
belletrist, the essayist and the populizer of Greek thought, and
there is Cicero, the lawyer, the politician and the public speaker,
the orator whose rhythms, whose periodic sentences, whose rolling
waves of language and staccato changes of pace were the models for
the preachers and politicians of the Western world from his own time
to that of Winston Churchill's, after which no public existed for
utterances longer than a few curt minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Everitt manfully struggles to do justice to Cicero, the writer and
orator, but it's heavy going with a readership who cannot be presumed
to have knowledge of the subject. Whatever the aspect of Cicero's
life, his poor biographer must always start at square one.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with all the difficulties, a story worth reading grows out of
the book. We are shown a picture of a country riven with problems, an
ancient democracy at loggerheads with itself, unable to use its
political processes to cure what ails it. We see a crowd of
politicians who, in the greedy confusions of the moment, as
precedent, tradition and decorum fall away, are increasingly prone to
illegalities and using force to have their way. We see gangs of
ruffians running and ruling the streets of the capital, judicial
murders and unconstitutional half measures which fail and invite yet
more indefensible illegalities.</TE>
<TE>   As Everitt tells it, the future of Rome comes down to two men,
Julius Caesar and Cicero. Caesar is the nonpareil of the age,
victorious in battle and nearly as unconquerable in the political
arena, an eloquent speaker in his own right whose ambitions exceed
the simple desire for power and extend to extinguishing the old,
failing political system and instituting a new, effective imperial
one in its place.</TE>
<TE>   Against him and the times stands Cicero, by his own estimation a
physical coward in a martial society and in a time of civil war.
Cicero is the constitutionalist, the traditionalist, a politician who
thinks that Caesar is wrong, that there is nothing wrong with the
underlying system which good magistrates and a few sensible changes
in the laws cannot repair.</TE>
<TE>   In this version of Cicero's life, his zigzags, his deals, his
flip-flops are taken to be his maneuvers to fend off Caesar and keep
him from power. Other authors have looked at those years and seen a
cowardly Cicero, unable to commit to any faction lest it be the wrong
faction and he be put to death for joining it. The different
interpretations probably can't be settled, but that's a dispute for
professional historians.</TE>
<TE>   What all agree on is that in the last months of his life, after
Caesar's assassination, something happened to Cicero. The artful
dodging stopped, the switching sides and the double-talking ended and
another man stepped onto the stage. This was a determined, commanding
Cicero, one heedless of his own safety, the classic senator in his
toga, an unyieldingly eloquent defender of the old Roman liberties
and of the Republic.</TE>
<TE>   This was the final Cicero, the one taken up by Voltaire's
generation in its struggle to destroy the divine right of kings, the
statesman venerated by the American patriots, the heroic Cicero, the
inspirational Cicero.</TE>
<TE>   At this point he comes off the pages, and one more time calls down
through the ages to us, exhorting us not to give way, but to stand
again with him for liberty.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   Richard Schickel, in reviewing "The Bad and the Beautiful:
Hollywood in the Fifties" by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair (Book
Review, June 9), manages somehow to leave out the most obvious, the
most pertinent criticism to be leveled at the book: The '50s were the
period of the blacklist and the McCarthy era, when more than 300
screenwriters couldn't work anymore in Hollywood, when the climate of
fear was so great that the movies made during those years, were, in
Schickel's own words "bland and banal."</LD>
<LD>   Schickel's omission was undoubtedly due to his not wanting to
admit that the films of the left during the '30s and '40s had been a
substantial and humanist contribution to our culture.</LD>
<TE>   Norma Barzman</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   Editor's note: Screenwriters Norma Barzman and her late husband,
Ben, left Hollywood for Europe in 1949 because of the blacklist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To the editor:</TE>
<TE>   In his review of "Radical Hollywood" (Book Review, May 12),
Richard Schickel recommends that the reader search out "Part of Our
Time," by Murray Kempton, which he says contains "the best short
summary of Hollywood's communists." I suspect he finds Kempton's
summary congenial not for its truth, but because it serves his
purpose; it is hardly a flattering portrait Kempton paints of them.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after Kempton's book was published, Dalton Trumbo (one of
the Hollywood Ten) wrote to Kempton, chiding him for his inaccurate
portrayal of the Hollywood left. Kempton replied with an apology, in
which he said, " ... I have come to believe that it is the greatest
of crimes to write about a man whose face you have never seen, since
writing is related to the subject more than the audience, and a man
you have never seen is unlikely to recognize himself in what you say
about him, and thus no engagement is possible. The book is full of
that, and my only hope is that it taught me something."</TE>
<TE>   Kempton goes on to say that if his book were to be reprinted, "I
should make the condition that you [Trumbo] write the introduction."
Kempton clearly thinks much less of his summary than Schickel does,
and anyone relying on it should be forewarned. (The complete exchange
between Trumbo and Kempton--well worth reading--was published on May
5, 1999, in the Nation and is available on the Nation's Web site.)</TE>
<TE>   Schickel goes on to agree with the position that "the communist
left--mostly screenwriters--did not appreciably or subversively
affect the content of American films during the popular front decade
(from the mid-'30s to the mid-'40s)" and proposes that they wrote
nothing more subversive than their Democrat and Republican
colleagues. Democrats and Republicans, it seems, created films just
as subversive as their leftist colleagues. Yet Schickel asserts that
the "lives and careers" of many of the Hollywood left were " ...
derailed ... by the Hollywood hearings of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities and the studio blacklist they engendered."</TE>
<TE>   Let's examine that: Having written material substantially no
different than their Republican and Democrat colleagues, the
Hollywood left caused the blacklist to happen. They brought it on
themselves. There was nothing else for the studios to do. The
blacklist was the only answer. The left made them do it. What
nonsense. If Schickel could get these parts of what appears to be his
polemic straight, I would be more likely to entertain the ideas he
puts forth in its remainder.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Trumbo</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   Editor's note: Christopher Trumbo is the son of Dalton Trumbo.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Schickel replies:</TE>
<TE>   I, of course, disagree entirely with Norma Barzman. I think
virtually every distinguished "substantive and humanist" film of the
'30s and '40s was written or directed by people whose commitment was
first to the art (or, if you prefer, the craft) of movies, and only
secondarily to an ideology ("Citizen Kane" anyone?). I have no doubt
that the majority of the writers and directors responsible for those
movies were liberals of some sort. It is, I am always pleased to
observe, ever thus in all the arts. But the sad fact is that very few
movies of this period that we still attend with pleasure and
intellectual profit were created by communists or those aligned to
them.</TE>
<TE>   There is not space here to "name names." But I urge interested
readers to compare the filmographies of the admitted communists with
those of the non- and anti-totalitarian left and see whose pictures
have best stood the test of time. Particularly during World War II,
they squandered their talents on popular front twaddle. Party hacks
as Hollywood hacks. Or vice versa. It is difficult to tell the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   To Christopher Trumbo, let me say this: Unlike Murray Kempton, I
did see the face of his father--I conducted an extensive interview
with him in the early '70s and had an all too brief correspondence
with him thereafter. He had about him a flair, gallantry and wit that
I found altogether admirable. His collection of letters, "Additional
Dialogue," is one of the most delightful volumes in my library, and I
often return to it simply for the pleasure its prose affords. And his
great "Only Victims" speech to the Writers Guild in 1970 is one of
the few truly humane documents to emerge out of a bad time.</TE>
<TE>   That Kempton politely turned aside Trumbo's wrath in the manner
his son cites does not surprise me. I would have done the same thing
myself. He was a difficult man to argue with. But that does not
invalidate Kempton's account of the Communist left in Hollywood. Nor,
I am sorry to say, does it validate Trumbo's career as a
screenwriter. He wrote one excellent screenplay ("Gun Crazy") while
he was blacklisted, and there are passages in some of his other work
("Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," "Our Vines Have Tender Grapes") that
are quite fine--sweet-spirited and, yes, "humanistic." In any case,
they were much less bloodthirsty than the wartime writing of such
Communist colleagues as Albert Maltz. On the other hand, there is the
lunatic "little guy" speech that concludes "Tender Comrade" in a
flood of popular front banalities that is indefensible by any
reasonable standard.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of tough-tender trash was always the fatal flaw of the
Communist writers and it was different in tone and intent from the
writing of Christopher Trumbo's "Democrats and Republicans." It has
always interested me that the best of the Communist writers (Dalton
Trumbo and Ring Lardner Jr.) were at their best when they were at
their least overtly ideological, when they let their people talk and
behave naturalistically instead of gaseously speechifying about the
virtues of the common man (or the Soviet Union). But then, I've never
argued that the communists deserved to be blacklisted for bad
writing. I do think, however, that their strategy of silence about
their allegiances in the face of HUAC's inquiries--a strategy that
many among them disputed--did their own cause a disservice--and
surely was one of the forces that dragged many non-Stalinist leftists
into the pit with them.</TE>
<TE>   These letters and this response, like those published here two
weeks ago, stray far from the intent of the review that occasioned
them. This was simply to point out that "Radical Hollywood" is a bad
book, disastrously sloppy in its historiography and less than honest
about its ideological biases. Beyond that, I must say, the fervor of
these letter writers is dismaying. Everywhere else in American
culture, the Stalinists and their heirs are held in richly deserved
contempt. They didn't deserve to lose their jobs because of their
"ideas," but they were ever the noisy (yet also conspiratorial)
supporters of a murderous system of beliefs. It is only in Hollywood
history that they are regarded as martyr-heroes in the cause of free
speech. It was against this deification of them that Dalton Trumbo
spoke so eloquently to the Writers Guild--and received for his pains
the contempt of his sometime Communist colleagues. It is long past
time that we stop accepting their own inflated evaluations of their
contributions to screen history and their own falsely innocent
evaluations of their role in the social and political history of
their era.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To the editor:</TE>
<TE>   It seems not much has changed since the 1980s when I started my
broadcast career as a sports reporter. A "girl" sports reporter. I
left sports for hard news after having tobacco juice spit on my shoes
one time too often.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke dismisses Elizabeth Kaye's insights in "Ain't No
Tomorrow: Kobe, Shaq, and the Making of a Lakers Dynasty" (Book
Review, May 19) as those of a "nosy organizer of the annual block
party." Please. Plaschke would never use such a line if the writer of
the book was a guy. Apparently nothing has changed over the last two
decades. Girls still aren't invited to the big game.</TE>
<TE>   Kitty Felde</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   Editor's note: Kitty Felde is host of "Talk of the City" on
KPCC-FM (89.3).</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke replies:</TE>
<TE>   As one who has had tobacco juice splattered across his loafers
many times, I understand Felde's characterization of the sports
world. But to say that "girl" sports reporters are not welcome there
is as offensive to all journalists as those brown stains, and is
certainly not relevant to Elizabeth Kaye, whose hard work opened the
doors that led to the writing of this book.</TE>
<TE>   I characterized her as "the nosy organizer of the annual block
party" because of her information, not because of her gender. That
Felde would offer such a stereotype inspires me to invite her to my
neighborhood's next block party which, if last year was any
indication, will be organized by a man.</TE>

<LD>EYES TO SEE OTHERWISE: Selected Poems, By Homero Aridjis, Edited by
Betty Ferber and George McWhirter, New Directions: 312 pp., $19.95</LD>
<LD>   Illiteracy is the only adequate excuse for not having read the
poetry of Homero Aridjis, one of Mexico's most famous poets, next to
Octavio Paz. It is often said that poets are the conscience of their
countries, but Aridjis, who is one of that country's leading
environmentalists, is also Mexico's eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Reading this collection, written from 1960 to 2000 and translated
by Betty Ferber, W.S. Merwin, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Kenneth
Rexroth to name a few, is like floating through time; it evokes a
childhood and a child's vision. Aridjis, born in 1940, is inspired
not only by his own childhood spent in the mountainous town of
Contepec in Michoacan, where the monarch butterflies winter each
year, but also by literature and paintings and by Nahuatl chants and
Huichol songs.</LD>
<TE>   In his earliest poems, Aridjis begins spinning his cosmography.
The Earth he describes seems new, full of shapes like spirals and
stars and fruit. Light moves in and through the objects in these
early poems with no barriers; wheat, water, rocks and branches are
all illuminated from within:</TE>
<TE>   The time of poetry</TE>
<TE>   forms a fruit of light</TE>
<TE>   which falls to earth</TE>
<TE>   trembling on its shadow.</TE>
<TE>   Light and shadows play through these poems as if the air in them
were clean and pure. Aridjis frequently describes the same scene at
different times of day, not unlike what Monet did in his painting at
Giverny.</TE>
<TE>   The poems of the late '70s are more earthbound. The pronoun most
commonly used is "I" or "he," referring to a slightly
disenfranchised, distanced man: "he wasn't feeling well in truth he
never felt well ... / he had a wine glass in which he kept algae
...." The "I" is often a mariner: "I am going to the boats of
solitude / where a man takes refuge at night." It is reminiscent of
Constantine Cavafy. There is less turbulence in the poems of the
'70s, less easy drifting between dimensions. The images are of roots
and dust and apples and blood. "We are tired men," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, death creeps into the poems, and one feels as if one has
been kicked from the Garden of Eden. There is revolution, ancestors,
grandchildren, peasants and donkeys, daggers and poems; generations
telescope down to destruction:</TE>
<TE>   What street to take</TE>
<TE>   that doesn't lead to the tyrants plaza</TE>
<TE>   where to turn</TE>
<TE>   where his portrait isn't</TE>
<TE>   on what bench to sit</TE>
<TE>   without his eyes watching.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1980s, Aridjis' poetry is full of the smell of gasoline,
rotting food and mud. The light is trapped. Movement is shackled:</TE>
<TE>   We put bolts on the eyes,</TE>
<TE>   locks on the hands,</TE>
<TE>   limits to the lightening.</TE>
<TE>   But life keeps its distance</TE>
<TE>   love to its word</TE>
<TE>   and poetry comes up where it can.</TE>
<TE>   There is distance and death:</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow we will die twice over</TE>
<TE>   Once as individuals</TE>
<TE>   a second time as a species.</TE>
<TE>   A reader misses the "you," a guardian angel, a pure being.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the poems of the 1990s, there is the pronoun "one," that
most august of pronouns, distant but part of, spanning all time, all
vision. These poems fly again over years and in cycles, back to the
author's childhood. They defy forgetting. They are full of eagles and
serpents and whales. They include poems to the poet's wife and
daughter. There is little question in these poems that by remembering
we can save even that which we have destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Even "you" comes back, "running down the street / wrapped in a
shabby raincoat." Aridjis plays among the gray whales the way he
played among the monarch butterflies as a child, seeing through their
eyes and also God's:</TE>
<TE>   there is no splendor greater than a grey</TE>
<TE>   when the light turns it</TE>
<TE>   silver ....</TE>
<TE>   And the whales came up</TE>
<TE>   to spot God over</TE>
<TE>   the dancing gunnels of the waters</TE>
<TE>   and God was sighted by a whale's eye.</TE>
<TE>   What a privilege to read selections from a life's work, to see
through Aridjis' eyes, to swim and travel through his visions and
defeats. Try, even if you do not read much poetry, to read it like a
novel. Don't stop over words, don't say to yourself, "I really don't
know what he meant there," just let your eyes move restfully over the
pages. You will come to the end. "Ever since I was very young / I
learned to eat air," Aridjis writes. Learn to eat air.</TE>

<DH>WHO OWNS HISTORY?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World,
By Eric Foner, Hill &amp; Wang: 256 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN J. ROSS</AU>
<BD>Steven J. Ross is professor of history at the
University of Southern California and the author of "Working-Class
Hollywood: Silent Film and the Shaping of Class in America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The past matters, and how we choose to remember it matters even more.
During the last decade, Americans bitterly debated how to represent
the Columbus quincentennial, the 50th anniversary of the dropping of
the first atomic bomb, public displays of the Confederate battle flag
in the South and what themes and groups to include in our basic
history standards for public schools.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of these controversies is the question: Who has the
right to control the interpretation of the past? Or, as Eric Foner
asks with the title of his new book, "Who Owns History?" "Everyone
and no one," suggests Foner, one of the nation's preeminent American
historians, "which is why the study of the past is a constantly
evolving, never-ending journey of discovery."</LD>
<LD>   Nine previously published essays in this valuable volume address
three important aspects of that journey: how historians' life
experiences shape their view of the past, the crucial uses of history
in the wake of globalization and the rebuilding of nation-states and
how misunderstandings about slavery and its aftermath affect
contemporary ideas of race and the meaning of citizenship.</LD>
<TE>   Foner begins by looking back on his Jewish upbringing in New York
as the child of a politically engaged family and then charts his
political and intellectual odyssey with his mentor, famed historian
Richard Hofstadter. He follows this with four essays that
perceptively explore the role of, as this section is titled, "History
in a Changing World."</TE>
<TE>   Foner is at his most instructive when discussing the practical
uses of history in a nation's seeking to chart visions for its
future. In the wake of perestroika and Nelson Mandela's election as
president, Russians and South Africans found that "a history created
to reinforce the old regime was being completely rethought, often in
surprising ways and not without sometimes bitter debate." In South
Africa, new histories gave voice to those previously excluded from
the nation's official history, and emphasized how multiracial
cooperation led to the overthrow of apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking the past, however, can also create fissures in the
present. Foner describes the deep divide between young Soviets, who
disdained the abuses of the past, and older citizens, who resented
having their past struggles forgotten or, worse still, "dismissed by
the media and younger generations as pointless." Historians can help
bridge this chasm, Foner suggests, by analyzing the "successes as
well as failures" of the past and using them to give the Soviet Union
"a new future."</TE>
<TE>   Foner's strongest work as a historian is in the area of race, and
this book's most provocative section, "The Enduring Civil War,"
enters into the "history wars" by placing contemporary debates over
immigration, affirmative action, racial discrimination and American
nationalism in what he believes is their proper historical context.
Foner is especially critical of court cases in the late 1980s that
sought to overturn affirmative action. A Supreme Court majority
decision in Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union (1989), he insists, was
based on a faulty historical interpretation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1866 that "completely misrepresented the Reconstruction Congress"
and its efforts "to secure for former slaves the right to compete for
advancement in the market place." Similar cases saw the majority of
justices distorting contemporaneous reasons behind the passage of the
13th, 14th and 15th Amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Foner is equally critical of Ken Burns' public television series,
"The Civil War," for reducing the conflict to a melodrama about a
"family quarrel among white Americans." Foner chastises Burns for
portraying the destruction of slavery as "a side issue" and
minimizing the role of African Americans, especially during
Reconstruction. He also criticizes the filmmaker for celebrating the
"road to reunion without considering the price paid for national
conciliation--the abandonment of the idea of racial justice."</TE>
<TE>   A writer and scholar with the rare ability to present complex
ideas in a clear and engaging manner, Foner has given us a volume
especially vital for anyone concerned with understanding how
interpretations of a seemingly long-gone past continue to shape--or
misshape, as the author frequently warns--the laws and attitudes of
today.</TE>

<LD>GOD'S FOOL, By Mark Slouka, Alfred A. Knopf: 270 pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   Darin Strauss' 2000 novel "Chang and Eng" presented the
surprisingly affecting story of the famous Siamese twins who settled
in North Carolina--raising families and holding slaves--in the
decades preceding the Civil War. It's impossible not to think of
Strauss' book while reading Mark Slouka's "God's Fool," a new effort
to fictionalize the hopelessly entwined lives of these bygone
sideshow superstars.</LD>
<LD>   If "Chang and Eng," narrated by the uptight, God-fearing Eng,
offered one side of the brothers' dual history, then "God's Fool,"
narrated by the erratic, drink-loving Chang, offers, at last, the
other. Though Strauss' Eng was conscientious about facts and dates,
Slouka's Chang is enraptured by the fleeting moments that threaten to
become lost to memory.</LD>
<TE>   He isn't fixated on the ligature that ties him to his brother or
with the freaky details of show business or with the 21 kids they
managed to sire. Instead, Slouka zeroes in on the unlikely friendship
between Chang's son Christopher and a slave, the still-flickering
ember of a love lost years ago in Paris and the quiet minutes before
the Confederates launched Pickett's Charge. (Christopher may have
been a participant.)</TE>
<TE>   In the end, we realize that Slouka's eccentric telling of Chang's
life has eluded all of our sordid questions and has miraculously
elevated us above being mere gawkers.</TE>

<TE>   POINT FURY, By John Maxwell, Scribner: 320 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   May God have mercy on aging rock guitarists, for John Maxwell, in
his debut thriller, will have none. The guitar-slinger in question is
Chris Nielson, a well-meaning dude from Boston who has spent most of
his adult life racking up near-misses: His grunge-metal band, X Bomb,
had a minor radio hit but, naturally, got hosed by the record
industry; his longtime relationship with Cassie ended up going
nowhere, stuck in the Sargasso of late 20s indecision.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell catches up with Chris as he agrees to mansion-sit for Ted
Harper, his dad's Yale buddy, during the off-season on an isolated
spit of land near Ocean City, Md. It's here that Chris has come to
get his head together, but where, as he eventually discovers, his
menacing employer has vowed to "take you out of your little imaginary
world and bring you into the real one."</TE>
<TE>   But the world that Ted--a vivid capitalist-tool psycho--constructs
for Chris is far from real: Chris' first inkling that Ted is nuts
comes when he discovers that the mysterious girl he's had a fling
with is, in fact, an actress sent by Ted. When Chris unwisely
retaliates, "Point Fury" unleashes itself like a power-chord rampage,
and Chris is sucked into a game of revenge in which he's hopelessly
overmatched. Bracingly atmospheric and gleefully sadistic to its
wishy-washy protagonist, Maxwell's debut lays bare the paranoia
underlying slackerdom.</TE>

<TE>   CONFESSING A MURDER, By Nicholas Drayson, W.W. Norton: 282 pp.,
$23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Confessing a murder" was a phrase used by Charles Darwin to
describe his misgivings on unveiling the theory of evolution.
Darwin's hesitation--and the unlikely provenance of his brilliant
theory--are at the heart of Australian naturalist Nicholas Drayson's
entertaining first novel, which takes the form of a message in a
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   The bottle (actually a glass jar "bound around with a layer of
soft bark from the Pisonia tree to keep it safe from hard blows, and
tied with the tendrils of the floating water-lily") was jettisoned by
a nameless naturalist--a childhood friend of Darwin's--searching for
golden scarab beetles while stranded on a remote Pacific island
obliterated by a volcano in the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   While this erudite, doomed castaway catalogs the island's
Galapagos-esque profusion of life--dildoe trees, land cucumbers and
cocoa-nut crabs--he tells us about growing up as a gay orphan in the
rarefied world of Darwin's family, pointing Darwin toward natural
selection (an idea that the religious Darwin balked at) and harboring
a lifelong infatuation with an undeserving rogue named Charley, who
accompanies him on his golden scarab quest.</TE>
<TE>   As his descriptions of the island's life forms--and their outre
mating habits--accumulate, we realize that our stranded narrator is
working up to confessing an altogether different kind of murder. The
postmodern conceit of the found manuscript is worn around the edges,
but Drayson infuses it with engagingly fusty prose and with a hero
who just might be a snake in the grass of his atoll Eden.</TE>

<DH>SUNDANCE TO SARAJEVO: Film Festivals and the World They
Made,  By Kenneth Turan, University of California Press: 182 pp.,
$24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM SHONE</AU>
<BD>Tom Shone is a film critic for the Daily Telegraph of
London.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every journalist knows the moment when it comes. The moment when
opportunity beckons, when fate gathers in the wings, and life takes
on that hard, gem-like flame of Manifest Destiny. For Michael Herr,
it was in Vietnam. For Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, it was
Watergate. For Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan, it was
the 2000 ShoWest film festival in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   It was there, amid the meditative calm which only vast imitation
pyramids can induce, that Turan met with a theater owner who claimed
to do for seating comfort what "Tarantino did for Travolta." There,
that he met some Bavarian brothers who were "passionate about
pretzels." And there--beset by the snarling forces of Mammon and the
multiplex--that Turan discovered that there was "something
inescapably exhilarating about this kind of joyful cacophony....
Somewhere in the world it's showtime every minute of the day, and
what could be better than that?"</LD>
<TE>   There speaks a true film critic--a member of that bleary-eyed and
unblinking elect who think nothing of watching four Macedonian epics,
back to back, with a break only for cheese sandwiches--and the only
mortals on Earth with the constitution to withstand film festivals.
As Turan says in "Sundance to Sarajevo," "no one seems to be exactly
sure how many festivals there are in the world," but it is something
like 500, ranging from the Switzerland's Neuchatel International
Fantasy Film Festival, "the only Swiss festival devoted to the
bizarre and the imagination," to the Hardacre film festival in Iowa,
designed to answer the perennial question, gnawing at filmgoers
everywhere, "... yes, but will it play in Iowa?"</TE>
<TE>   It is in the nature of film festivals to lack coherence--they
must, necessarily--so any book about the phenomena is bound to
partake of that shapelessness; and indeed Turan's book reads very
episodically, with little in the way of a central thesis or theme.
Turan kicks off with the big cheeses--Cannes, Sundance and
ShoWest--and from there moves on to such geopolitical hot spots as
Havana and Sarajevo, which "open a window onto a wider, more diverse
world," according to the dust jacket, and where the film festival
becomes "a vehicle for understanding the world's most vexing
dilemmas." Hmm. You mean like figuring out why the Yugoslavs, having
survived the world's longest siege in modern history, might choose to
spend their hard-earned freedom by waiting in line to see "Basic
Instinct"?</TE>
<TE>   The prize for best historical timing, though, has to go to the
first Cannes festival, originally slated for Sept. 1, 1939, a date
abandoned only when the Germans invaded Poland. Maybe because of this
ignominious beginning, Cannes has grown into the happiest of
festivals, salted with worldliness, totally at ease with its own
chaos and the only place in the world, according to Tim Robbins,
where you stand any chance of "walking into a room and meeting a
great actor like Gerard Depardieu and then walking out and seeing
this poster of a woman with large breasts holding a machine gun."</TE>
<TE>   Unhappiest are those festivals weighed down by the sincerity of
their own mandate--most famously Sundance, dedicated to nurturing
cinema's most overlooked wallflowers, although you'd have a hard time
pinning that label to such robust crowd-pleasers as "Reservoir Dogs,"
"The Usual Suspects" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral." These days,
for the true spirit of independence, you have to delve deeper into
Sundance's undergrowth--into the Slam Dance, Lapdance, Digidance and
Son of Sam Dance festivals, where the ideal of proud unwatchability
still reigns supreme. One poster in particular caught Turan's eye:
"No stars! No action! No sex! In color!" Yes, but will it play in
Iowa?</TE>

<HD>Gear Is Only the Beginning</HD>
<DH>REBECCA SOLNITTHE COMPLETE WALKER IV, By Colin Fletcher and
Chip Rawlins, Alfred A. Knopf: 848 pp., $22.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA SOLNIT</AU>
<BD>Rebecca Solnit is the author of "Wanderlust: A History
of Walking" and "Savage Dreams: A Journey Into the Landscape Wars of
the American West."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As you are reading this review, a stooped woman is going step by step
down Fairfax Avenue, clutching a bag containing three bagels--her
breakfast for the next six days--and in her imagination, she is
walking down a darker street in Prague or Krakow 60 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere a young couple are strolling up Cesar Chavez Avenue, but
this time the slowness is voluptuous, matching their strides to vague
recollections of the rhythm of the night before, saying hello to the
familiar faces they pass, binding the community a little more tightly
together.</LD>
<LD>   "The Complete Walker" is by no means complete because it takes no
interest in these kinds of walking, culturally resonant though they
may be. It is not, in fact, a book about walking in all its forms and
permutations. It is, instead, a massive compendium of useful stuff to
know and to tote when you engage in a very specific subset of
walking: backpacking. And it has, since its first printing in 1968,
become known as the hiker's bible.</LD>
<TE>   A man clearly in love with walking, co-author and legendary
ambulator Colin Fletcher writes fondly in the opening pages of a
place "ten minutes' drive from the apartment where I used to live ...
a long, grassy ridge from which you could look out over parkland and
sprawling metropolis, over bay and ocean and distant mountains. I
often walked along this ridge in order to think uncluttered thoughts
or to feel with accuracy or to sweat away a hangover .... "</TE>
<TE>   Hiking purists will no doubt be amused that Fletcher--the great
long-distance walker who was the first man to walk the length of
Grand Canyon National Park, a feat he accomplished in two months in
1967--would drive to this nearby locale. But walking is clearly an
eccentric and individual pleasure: C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, for
instance, used to cover vast distances in the English countryside
together with no other special equipment than money to spend at pubs
where they quenched their thirst every half-dozen or dozen miles.
Such walking, unlike climbing, bicycling, skiing, hunting and
backpacking, will never be an industry.</TE>
<TE>   That said, in the 34 years since the first edition of "The
Complete Walker," a dizzying array of specialized, improved,
lightened high-tech gear has turned backpacking into a huge industry
that gives the authors enough to make a substantial tome. The book's
premise is that you are creating a "house on your back," and it is
organized around this unpoetic conceit: Shoes are the foundation;
packs are your walls. A section on "Furniture and Appliances" deals
with flashlights, compasses and so forth. Fletcher and Chip Rawlins
certainly like stuff, and they like detail. Long-winded to the point
of being comical, they miss no opportunity, for example, to digress
on the pros and cons of hiking in sandals or to calculate caloric
burn rates. The latter subject begets a four-page digression on
scientific measurement tables and rules that are, by the fifth page,
rejected for trial-and-error methods of figuring out how many
calories you need to carry and consume.</TE>
<TE>   If there were a micronuclear rotator-cufflink zilchifying mosquito
habitat-detector that wicks away moisture and comes with a hatchet
attachment, these authors would have tested it and devoted a few
pages to their conclusions. In more than 800 pages, "The Complete
Walker" becomes a wildly comprehensive pep talk on preparedness and a
shopping list too heavy to pack.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Fletcher and Rawlins are, with their strong opinions,
chatty style and amusing anecdotes, easy to read, and they know
whereof they speak. Fletcher is the author of two books on his
long-distance walks as well as all the previous editions of "The
Complete Walker," while Rawlins is an environmental writer and
professional outdoorsman (mostly doing fieldwork and pursuing his own
pleasure at high altitudes, in extreme weather conditions and in
remote places around Wyoming).</TE>
<TE>   However windy, their book is worthwhile. For lack of the right
equipment and preparation, people die, get sick, get miserable and
burden search-and-rescue teams, by often using nowadays the piece of
equipment they did pack: a cell phone. (For those nonemergency calls,
Rawlins offers a splendidly cranky diatribe about obnoxious
technology that interferes with what wilderness is supposed to be.)</TE>
<TE>   But the best parts of "The Complete Walker IV" make it clear that
gear is only the beginning and that no amount of informed shopping
can substitute for experience. For example, in a footnote, Rawlins
offers up, "A general principle: animal trails blunder through
endless petty irritations and undertake seemingly aimless detours in
order to skirt major problems, like V-cut stream gorges and
bottomless talus fields. That is, they tend to piss you off while
keeping you out of real trouble."</TE>
<TE>   It's gems like this that make the book valuable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Complete Walker IV'</TE>
<TE>   One of the joys of being alive today is the complexity of our
human world. We have at our fingertips more riches than anyone has
ever had: books by the zillion; CDs and movies and TV by the ton; the
Internet; also the opportunity to move around almost as we please.
But in time the sheer richness of this complexity can sandbag you.
You long for simplicity, for the yin to that yang. You yearn--though
you may not openly know it--to take a respite from your eternal
wrestling with the abstract and instead to grapple, tight and long
and sweaty, with the tangible. So once you've started walking down
the right road, you begin, sooner or later, to dream of truly wild
places.</TE>

<DH>NEAR A THOUSAND TABLES: A History of Food, By Felipe
Fernandez-Armesto, The Free Press: 258 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLIFFORD A. WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>Clifford A. Wright is the author of "A Mediterranean
Feast," winner of the 2000 James Beard/KitchenAid Cookbook of the
Year, and the forthcoming "Real Stew."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A curious thing about food history is that historians, when they
entertain it at all, consider it a quaint diversion. Given
humankind's interest in food for nourishment and enjoyment, this
lacuna is a surprise. The few extant food histories tend to be
uncritical and unsystematic in their approach and characterized by
antiquarianism. Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, a Professorial Fellow of
Queen Mary, University of London, understands this situation and
hopes his "Near a Thousand Tables: A History of Food," will fill this
gap in serious food histories.</LD>
<LD>   The title of Fernandez-Armesto's book, which comes from a line in
a William Wordsworth poem, seems ironic since he veers far from the
table, offering by his own admission not a history of food, but a
"useful alternative": "to take a genuinely global perspective; to
treat food history as a theme of world history ... to treat
evenhandedly the ecological, cultural and culinary concepts of the
subject ... to trace connections, at every stage, between the food of
the past and the way we eat today; and to do all this briefly." Well,
if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck: This
book is a history of food.</LD>
<TE>   This Braudelian desire for "total history" is a tall order, and
one is skeptical that it can be useful and brief. In fewer than 300
pages, he identifies eight revolutions that define the history of
food, ranging from the invention of cooking to the discovery of New
World foods to the modern industrial revolution in food production.</TE>
<TE>   The first revolution, cooking, transformed society. Although I
find his definition of cooking overly broad (I don't think of the
marinating of fish for a ceviche as cooking), one can agree that
cooking was an important invention because it forged community
through cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Eating has meaning beyond nourishment: It has ritual and magical
aspects, the most salient for Fernandez-Armesto being cannibalism.
Cannibalism is the topic food writers love to write about. The scenes
of human limbs butchered for the grill or of cannibal women supping
blood and biting entrails makes for lively reading, but
Fernandez-Armesto takes the subject further. His discussion of the
common ground shared by cannibals and vegans is brilliant, focusing
on the purpose of cannibalism, not the reality or morality of it. (He
excludes "famine cannibalism.")</TE>
<TE>   Is cannibalism nutritive or is it ritualistic? He points out that
most societies that practice cannibalism do so for its ritualistic
aspects: Cannibals eat human flesh to transform themselves into
better or more powerful humans. The modern counterpart of the
cannibal is the vegetarian, who for virtuous reasons and rarely for
nutritious ones, eschews meat, thinking he or she is better for it.</TE>
<TE>   The graphic descriptions of the effects of scurvy, his discussion
of the connection between food and health and his critique of
dietetics--the science of applying the principles of nutrition to the
diet--make for some of the book's most rewarding reading.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a thousand years, the humoral theory of Galen, the
second century Greek physician, postulated that the four fundamental
elements of the world have counterparts in the human body and that
those counterparts have to be in equilibrium. This theory prevailed
until its discrediting by modern science. So Fernandez-Armesto is
right to argue that "the notion that diet should serve to preserve a
balance between yin and yang is, essentially, a humoral theory: we
have rejected humoral theories of Western origin, but those which
come clouded with emanations of the 'mystic East' manage to retain
their Western adherents." But we'd like to see a more sustained
argument, especially given the contemporary popularity of health and
diet fads.</TE>
<TE>   One of the wackiest, and one of my favorite, if not totally
convincing, arguments in this book is that snails ought to have an
honored place in the history of food because they were "herded" by
primitive man. Challenging the received wisdom that an increase in
the consumption of mollusks and snails in a society can be explained
only by a shortage of bigger game, he argues that snail breeding is
an overlooked revolution in the history of food because the easily
managed creatures had considerable advantages. His argument is not as
far-fetched as it sounds.</TE>
<TE>   After cooking, the invention of agriculture ranks as the next big
innovation of the human species in relation to food. The traditional
argument is that agriculture developed from gathering and herding and
that herding was a result of diffusion from one place.
Fernandez-Armesto does not accept this view. Herding, in his mind, is
not extraordinary, but developed at the same time as gathering and
hunting. While making for interesting reading, his evidence is merely
anecdotal and doesn't support a systematic argument. Some of the
analogies are a bit of a stretch, for example, likening cheese-making
to hunting because the exposed milk traps bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   There is no argument that the invention of agriculture was a major
revolution in the history of the world. But to say that the next
great revolution is the Columbian exchange of the late 15th century,
when Columbus brought new foods to the Americas and brought back
foods from the New World such as tomatoes and potatoes, ignores the
Arab agricultural revolution of the 8th to 12th centuries, a
revolution as important as the Columbian exchange. Without it the
West would not have macaroni, oranges, sugar, Asiatic rice, spinach
and a host of other foods.</TE>
<TE>   The origin of agriculture is a hotly debated topic and
Fernandez-Armesto masterfully lays out some of these arguments. But
to conclude that farming is something that could have just happened,
"a revolution by accident," and is not a conscious result of
organized, goal-oriented human activity, seems intellectually
unsatisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Fernandez-Armesto's argument is hindered by his
sloppy discussion of wheat. It is incorrect to say that durum wheat
is not particularly gluten-rich. Durum wheat is gluten-rich and it is
that fact, coupled with its low moisture content, that makes it the
sui generis food that it is. Durum wheat products, in the form of
macaroni, couscous, bulgur and hardtack, were revolutionary 1,000
years ago when their long shelf life was critical in times of
perennial famines.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez-Armesto seems to make a distinction between "cracked
wheat" and "bulgur," but they are essentially the same. And to
describe bulgur wheat grains as a form of couscous is plain
wrong--they are two separate things, although both are made from
durum wheat.</TE>
<TE>   Learning how food became a social differentiator, about world
gastronomy and the role of long-range trade is a pleasurable read but
I have a few complaints. Kushuri, a popular Cairo street food of rice
and lentils, has a history much older than having been brought by
British forces as he claims. And chili con carne does not contain
black beans, but red kidney beans (although purists, as he correctly
points out, don't use beans at all). How can he say that the pigeon
pea has not established a place in the culinary repertoire to rival
the black-eyed pea when it is the pea used for split pea soup and the
Indian dal? He misidentifies the 13th century "Baghdad Cookery Book"
as "the 10th century text known as 'The Baghdad Cook.'" These are
quibbles, but it is this lack of rigor that has marred food history
in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez-Armesto has written a book more polemic than history.
His central concern is that the modern, post-industrial relationship
of humans with nourishment is somehow desocializing, that "food on
the fly [fast food, prepared food] feeds the value of hustle,
nourishes the anomie of postindustrial society."</TE>
<TE>   His hope that the next food revolution will subvert the last (the
fast-food one we're in now) rests in part on the negative aspects of
modern food technology. We may intuitively accept this delicious
proposition, but doesn't there need to be an argument? Is it so
self-evident? After all, much about cooking is drudgery and that's
why women in the 20th century wanted liberation from it. If he wants
them, and men, back in the kitchen, he has to tell us the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a polemic, "Near a Thousand Tables" is an appetizingly
provocative book with a critical approach and an allusive writing
style that avoids an antiquarian's infatuation with arcana. Who
cannot appreciate his superb description of the proper way to eat an
oyster: "Unless you.... raise the half-shell to your mouth, throw
back your head, scrape the creature from its lair with your teeth,
taste its briny juice and squelch it slightly against the palate
before swallowing it alive, you deprive yourself of a historic
experience." It's a book one can sink one's teeth into, but whether
one comes away sated or not is another question.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Avisionary, wrote the poet William Blake, sees the world in a grain
of sand.</LD>
<LD>   The aim of "Crossings," the latest production from Cornerstone
Theater Company, is to envision the world atop a mound of
dirt--specifically the one heaped in front of St. Vibiana's, the
defunct, earthquake-damaged cathedral that was the seat of the
Catholic Church in Los Angeles for 120 years.</LD>
<LD>   The play, subtitled "Journeys of Catholic Immigrants," draws its
story outlines from the Bible. But many of the incidents and details
reflect the experiences of everyday Southern Californians who
emigrated from Cambodia, Africa, Mexico and Arab nations. It shows
each group leaving troubled homelands and finding refuge here, as
well as new challenges and discontents.</LD>
<TE>   The world that comes together atop that dusty pile in the
final act is not tidy or comfortable. Before culminating in a vision of
hope and peace, "Crossings" jostles against some of the most
explosive and headline-dominating issues now facing the church and
humankind.</TE>
<TE>   * Rey, an embittered Mexican American who has rejected his faith,
goes into a tirade against Catholicism that climaxes with a blanket
condemnation of priests as sexual abusers. "We place a sacred trust
in the hands of these people. And look what they do with it!"</TE>
<TE>   * John and Jawdette, Arab Catholic cousins from Jordan, nearly
come to blows over whether Palestinian suicide bombers deserve to be
included under the rubric of Jesus' teaching that "greater love hath
no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."</TE>
<TE>   * Sonunthear, a Cambodian woman, keeps her silence about the
genocidal horror she lived through under the Khmer Rouge. She fears
that if she opens her mouth, she will blame God.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rauch, Cornerstone's artistic director and co-founder,
chuckled at the suggestion that the company must have some prophetic
inspiration of its own, given how its Faith-Based Cycle, a 3 1/2-year
project that began last fall, is touching hot buttons from today's
front pages.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I were the kind of artist to say, 'We're on the cutting
edge, we anticipated these things.' But I think that would be
disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   The cycle began with the Festival of Faith--21 smaller plays
staged at houses of worship, including a Muslim school shortly after
the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It
will continue through the end of 2004 and possibly into 2005. On the
way are a play by Luis Alfaro about faith from the perspective of
gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, a play inspired by
African American clergy's attempts to grapple with the AIDS crisis in
the black community, and "Ten Acrobats in an Amazing Leap of Faith,"
a comedy about Muslim life in L.A. Other projects are planned from
the perspective of Jewish, Hindu, Pentecostal and secular humanist
viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerstone's modus operandi since it was formed in 1986 has been
for professional actors, writers and directors to forge links with
particular ethnic, racial or social groups, find out what issues and
events are on their minds, and turn the stories folks tell into
plays--with amateurs from each community acting many of the roles.</TE>
<TE>   "Issues of faith had come up in just about every project we'd ever
done, but we'd never made it the primary subject of the work," Rauch
said. "It felt like time to take that on."</TE>
<TE>   "Crossings," which opened Saturday, is based on five stories from
the Hebrew Bible and one episode from the New Testament. Each section
from the Old Testament features a different parish in the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles as creative partner. The play begins on the dirt mound
in front of St. Vibiana's with "Replenish the Earth," a retelling of
the Tower of Babel story. The question: In sowing division and
diversity among the peoples of the world, was God punishing the human
race or doing it a favor?</TE>
<TE>   Playgoers then take a theatrical tour of the former cathedral. In
"Beyond the Jordan," the Arab Catholic experience is seen as a
reflection of the Israelites' journey out of Egypt. It takes place in
the sanctuary, with its white marble altarpiece and oak confessional
booths. "Esther and the Exodus" plays out in a basement classroom,
and tells, a la the book of Esther, the story of immigrants in
peril--only this time it's Mexican illegals in L.A. instead of Jews
in ancient Persia. "Authenticite" radically reworks the story of Ruth
and Naomi, set against revolutionary chaos in Zaire. It will be
played in a courtyard with a fountain, overlooked by the former
residence of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. "Afloat," staged on a roof
five stories above ground, recasts the story of Noah's ark as a
Cambodian survival tale. Finally, "The Upper Room" unites characters
from the previous stories in a concluding evocation of Pentecost--the
New Testament episode that gathers together what was scattered at
Babel. It envisions God's word miraculously overcoming language
barriers and being universally understood.</TE>
<TE>   The OK to use St. Vibiana's came from Gilmore Associates, the
developer restoring the cathedral as a complex that will include
apartments and a performing arts center. Although retrofitting of the
damaged main church building probably won't begin until late summer,
the city has allowed limited uses, said project director Robert
Jones. Only "Beyond the Jordan" will take place inside the damaged
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Before any of this could come to pass, Cornerstone's crew of
writer-actors had to win the trust of each parish--while also
safeguarding the company's prerogative to tell stories without
censorship.</TE>
<TE>   Cornerstone members explained their methods and objectives in an
initial meeting last year at the archdiocese offices. Rauch says he
nervously broached the idea that the plays in "Crossings" would take
interpretive liberties with Bible stories, sometimes transforming
them in light of the experiences of today's immigrants. Would that be
blasphemous?</TE>
<TE>   "A fantastic woman representing one of the parishes said, 'I'll
tell you what's blasphemous. What's blasphemous is priests who stand
up in church and do not find a way to connect the word to our daily
lives. What you want to do is exactly what needs to be done.' "</TE>
<TE>   Would the church help Cornerstone find immigrant parishes to work
with? As director of ethnic groups ministry for the archdiocese, Irma
Isip says, it was her call. "There was a trust," she says. Knowing
that Catholic clergy and lay people would be intimately involved in
helping to create the plays, she saw no need to ask for script
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the playwrights attended Mass regularly at their partner
parishes to show their sincerity and to gain trust. Cornerstone
member Page Leong, the Chinese American writer of "Afloat," learned
about small details of Cambodian life. A shovel used in the play
should be made of tin scraps, her cast members said, because that is
all they had in the refugee camps after they escaped to Thailand. She
also witnessed rare exchanges within families for whom the horror of
the "killing fields" had been a subject to forget.</TE>
<TE>   "The youth sometimes don't know, and their parents didn't tell
them the stories," says Mary Blatz, director of the church-run
Cambodian Center at Our Lady of Mount Carmel parish in Long Beach.
"This play has made the two generations speak to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Father Hisham Dabaen, pastor to the 650 predominantly Jordanian
families that make up Southern California's far-flung Arab Catholic
community, said he knew instinctively that the project Cornerstone
outlined would be worthwhile. "I just felt a click--this is a good
thing."</TE>
<TE>   For actor-playwright Bernard White, working with the Arab Catholic
congregation meant having to walk the minefield of issues raised by
the Arab-Israeli conflict. One of the thorniest, he said, has been
how to handle stories parishioners told of Arab Christians being
disparaged by some Muslims. It's a powerful subject for drama. But
community members were leery of such portrayals, saying they are
exceptions, not the rule. This, they told White, is not a time for
Arabs to air their differences, but to show solidarity in support of
the Palestinians. White kept the story of Muslim-Catholic friction,
but toned down language he thought could be offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to represent the community and be true to them, but
ultimately these are my thoughts and I am responsible for what's
there," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardo Solano, who wrote "The Upper Room," says he came up with
a good laugh line, then scratched it because the joke might be seen
as mocking the core Catholic concept of bread and wine being
sacramentally transformed into the body and blood of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   But Solano left several other potential hot buttons in his script.
The best defense against offending religiously committed playgoers,
he thinks, is to tell the stories well and make the characters
believable. "By following the characters' stories," he says, "they're
more willing to listen and not have a knee-jerk reaction."</TE>
<TE>   White, who considers himself a devout Catholic, says he knew going
in that art which addresses questions of religious doctrine and
belief is always risky.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest concern was that we show the faith in a complex light.
To show the warts and pitfalls, but also capture the complexity of
spiritual arguments and not go for just the headlines."</TE>
<TE>   Throw in genocide, the Middle East powder keg, the hardships of
undocumented Mexican workers in America and depictions of the West
abandoning impoverished, strife-ridden Africa, and "Crossings" has,
if not the whole world in its sand, at least a good chunk of it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what made me want to be a part of it," White says. "That
kind of feeling that the whole world is watching. We're at the old
cathedral, down the street from the new cathedral, in this year after
the twin towers fell. There are no bigger issues right now than the
things we're talking about. I hope we do it justice. I hope God is
with us."</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK--High-culture maven Marjorie Taub is plotzed on the couch
in her Upper West Side co-op. All around the room are shelves filled
with books--the library of someone who spends a lot of time reading
and going to lectures at the 92nd Street Y and the New School for
Social Research. But Marjorie is depressed. Oy, is she depressed.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Marjorie recently had an episode. Not a suicide attempt,
you should know, but she did smash a few--OK, a number of--figurines
in the Disney store. Not to worry, they're not pressing charges.</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie is the title character in Charles Busch's comedy "The
Tale of the Allergist's Wife," which opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson
Theatre, directed by Lynne Meadow and starring Valerie Harper, Tony
Roberts and Michele Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Harper, who plays Marjorie, is not sitting on the couch. In fact,
she's not sitting anywhere just yet, because she hasn't shown up at
the publicists' office where she's scheduled for an interview. She's
reportedly stuck in midtown traffic, or dealing with problems at her
apartment, as it's later learned.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has already arrived, looking hale in a black knit shirt
and a brown tweed sport coat. The veteran stage and film actor plays
Harper's husband of 32 years, the highly successful and recently
retired allergist Dr. V. Ira Taub. As a lifelong New Yorker, Roberts
has a thing or two to say about this show--and how the long-running
Broadway hit may play in L.A. "All the references are very New York
savvy, and for that reason, we were very worried when we first
started whether or not audiences across the Hudson would dig it," he
says. "Even the pundits of New York are hard put to explain how this
has gone on."</TE>
<TE>   For a guy who says "dig it," he seems to know what he's talking
about. "The themes of this play are universal," he says. "They don't
only apply to any one ethnic or cultural group. It doesn't matter
that nobody west of the Hudson ever heard of the 92nd Street Y. She
could say it was the 186th Street Z. It wouldn't matter. They're
picking up on things that have nothing to do with being Jewish or
being in New York."</TE>
<TE>   The human whoopee cushion in this Gotham "Tale" is Lee Green
(played by Lee), Marjorie's old childhood friend who suddenly appears
and stirs things up. "You don't have to be Jewish to like rye bread,"
says the L.A.-based actress, speaking by phone a few weeks later.
"This average couple is just on their journey in life and things
happen to them. And of course there's all kinds of sexual titillation
that people wouldn't expect."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed: Mrs. Taub, describe to me your vision once more.</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie: It should be a feverish dream out of Baudelaire. Exotic,
mesmerizing. This doesn't say "extravagant decadence." This says
"lighting fixture."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed: No it says "romantic opulence."</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie (losing her patience): It says "Repro bought at cost."</TE>
<TE>   In Scene 1, Marjorie appears in a schmata of muumuu-like
proportions, a sartorial horror. Later on, once Lee is on the scene,
she's in Vera Wang.</TE>
<TE>   Busch is a man who knows that clothes make the woman--as well he
ought. He wore enough of them. In his earlier escapades, that is.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Busch reigned as one of the premiere thespian
drag queens of the East Village. He was known for writing and
starring in a clutch of campy cinema send-ups, including "Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom" and "Psycho Beach Party," which was released as a
low-budget film in 2000. Yes, honey, it's that Charles Busch.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he's shed the false eyelashes and gotten serious
about his writing. In fact, the Pasadena Playhouse recently announced
that next spring it will stage an adaptation of the Truman
Capote-Harold Arlen musical "House of Flowers" by the erstwhile
downtown diva and his longtime director, Kenneth Elliott. Set in a
West Indies bordello, the retooled 1954 work could prove Broadway
bound. No casting announcements yet, but wags on the Rialto say Busch
and Patti LaBelle are in a dead heat for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the opus du jour, the one that put the stardust in his
stilettos in the first place. It's a midlife crisis comedy about a
woman who has achieved a certain level of comfort and now finds
herself at a loss. Into her malaise trots her old girlhood pal,
looking sensational, to present poor Marjorie with the unbearable
contrast of everything her life is not.</TE>
<TE>   So who is this intruding enigma? "I would rather not say who I
think my character is, it's really nobody's business," chirps Lee,
best known from her Emmy-nominated stint on the 1979-93 CBS series
"Knots Landing" and still ever so hostess-with-the-mostes' bubbly.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost nobody understands her," Lee continues. "They understand
the outcome of what she does, the ramifications. And the wonderful
complications of who she might be are what one can have some fun
with. And of course she's so delicious because she's done everything
and everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Lee serves as a catalyst to getting Marjorie off her angst-ridden
tuchis. "Even though she's coming into a situation where it's a
married couple, there is something awry," Lee says. "She's coming
into their lives at a time when things are a little disjointed.</TE>
<TE>   "Marjorie is searching for herself," Lee continues. "She's
unhappy, that's how I read it. My character helps nudge the Marjorie
character. And by the way, the reason I'm always talking about
Marjorie is that this is Marjorie's plight, no question about it."</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie's story began to take shape in the late '90s, when Busch
was working on a number of projects, including the book for the 1997
Rusty Magee musical "The Green Heart," which was produced at the
Manhattan Theatre Club, where Meadow is artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   After "The Green Heart," Meadow and Busch decided to work together
again, and Busch began developing a piece based on a character from
his solo show, "Flipping My Wig." That character eventually became
Marjorie. The role was originally written for Linda Lavin, who
starred in the show's premiere run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in
1999 and went with it to Broadway the following year.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Busch, it would seem, has swum straight into the mainstream,"
the New York Times' Ben Brantley wrote. "And with the graceful,
unobtrusive assistance of the director ... he stays comfortably
afloat there. 'Tale' has moments cut from the synthetic cloth of
television comedy, and it doesn't quite know how to resolve itself.
But it earns its wall-to-wall laughs."</TE>
<TE>   (The doorbell rings. Ira runs on holding a bottle of
tranquilizers. He answers the door. It's Lee, holding two suitcases.)</TE>
<TE>   Lee: I am so sorry I'm late. I had this forcockta Indian cabdriver
who took me all the way across the river.</TE>
<TE>   To millions in TV land, Harper will always be Rhoda Morgenstern,
from "Rhoda" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." "This is only the
second New York Jewish character I've played since Rhoda," she says.
"She's very different from Rhoda. They come from the same background,
but she did what Rhoda wanted to do, nail a fabulous Jewish doctor
and have wealth."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Harper has been in the news with the Screen Actors
Guild presidential elections, first in November, and then, after that
vote was voided because of alleged irregularities, again in March. It
was a particular nasty bout of old guard-new guard mud wrestling. To
be sure, Harper held her own with the hair pulling but ultimately
lost to that little parvenu on the prairie, Melissa Gilbert. Now,
she'd rather not talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   "You went through lots that I didn't know about," Roberts says.
Harper smiles and shrugs off the whole tsurris.</TE>
<TE>   Harper joined the cast of "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" in
July 2001. She and Roberts had never acted together before, but they
had some common history to help lay the groundwork for their stage
marriage. It's no mean feat to create the illusion, night after
night, of 32 years of sharing the sheets--and Harper, a second wife
at that after the much-loved Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known each other for a long time," Harper says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," adds Roberts, "We had a mutual decorator."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it goes back further than that.</TE>
<TE>   Harper: I went to a professional children's school called the
School for Young Professionals on 56th Street. I graduated from
Luchow's, if you can imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: Luchow's restaurant?</TE>
<TE>   Harper: It was a tiny little private school. We had dinner in the
back room, and Mr. Quintano handed out the diplomas. So I graduated
from Luchow's.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: My family went to dinner there every Sunday night when we
were growing up. They had those violinists and Viennese music. It was
the place for families to go on birthdays and occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Harper: And graduations of small schools. I'm so sorry it closed.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: My graduation was at Carnegie Hall. I went to the High
School of Music and Art. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice.</TE>
<TE>   Harper: The old joke, right. My first job was at Radio City Music
Hall as one of the corps de ballet. In those days, the Rockettes were
the headliners, but there were 32 of us called the ballet girls.
There was a dog act sometimes and a magician. It was a complete show,
and we did it sometimes five times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: You were the third from the left. You winked at me.</TE>
<TE>   Harper: I probably did.</TE>
<TE>   All three stars agree that they disagree about whether there's a
message in "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," and if so, what it is.
Like a number of critics, they're also at odds over the play's
cockamamie ending.</TE>
<TE>   For the two-time Tony nominee Roberts, who has appeared in 20
Broadway productions and many films, the key lies in the episode that
gets everything going in the first place. "I would say that it's
about the condition of modern life for an intelligent and sensitive
woman who is having a life crisis," he says. "The event that starts
the play is the breaking of the statues in the Disney store. It's a
very important statement."</TE>
<TE>   Lee sees it as a matter of Marjorie taking responsibility. "One of
the important things that is said is that we can only change
ourselves, not the people around us," she says. "So when Marjorie
goes through her plight, initially complaining and fighting and
trying to change the people around her, by the time my character does
whatever she does, Marjorie walks out understanding that Ira is a
benevolent husband. And when the mother, Frieda, leaves, Marjorie
allows her mother to be her mother. She's not trying to change her
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Harper's take is Rhoda-like in its clarity. "For me, Charles' good
message is: Get off the couch," she says. "You're fine like you are.
Embrace your family with warts and all. Just be who you are. Cook
something with your doorman."</TE>
<TE>   "I disagree with you, but it's a very healthy disagreement,"
Roberts says. "I think Charles is tapping into a kind of frustration
that exists among all people at this age in life who have had
children, whose parents are still alive in some form, and who've
achieved the security of not having to worry about money. That's why
I think that the last message of it is 'a forget your troubles and be
happy' ending."</TE>
<TE>   Harper: No, it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: Whatever it is, it's only, forgive me, a sitcom
denouement out of a serious issue that's been raised. The way you get
out of it is not to wrap it up as quickly as you can with a few
jokes, and that's what the last part of the play is about, I'm sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Harper: I don't see it as a sitcom windup. I think it's deeper
than that. Yes, he's saying, forget the obsession. For God's sake,
seize the day.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts: There is a reconciliation and Marjorie is probably going
to not be so crazy and go in and break statues anymore. But she
hasn't really solved the existential dilemma that Charles has raised
in the earlier part of the play. This play is not about a woman who
says, 'Why haven't the caterers gotten here?' It's about a woman who
says, 'Why doesn't my life mean anything?' And everyone in the
audience is saying, 'Yes, that's what we want to know!"</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all their differences of opinion about the particulars of
"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," Roberts, Harper and Lee agree
that the experience of performing in Busch's play has given them
renewed insight into the universality of comedy.</TE>
<TE>   "What the audience perceives is that none of the particular
references matter," Roberts says. "What they pick up are the
generational conflicts between the mother and the daughter, the
problem between this woman and the culture in general, between this
woman and time going by, of this woman's feeling insignificant in
terms of her life's contribution. And that's what they'll see in Salt
Lake City and Philadelphia, and whether they're gentiles or Asians or
whatever. These are universal truths."</TE>

<DH>New albums bring attention to undeservedly obscure
compositions for piano or harpsichord</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The standard repertory for piano is large. But it is just the tip of
an ivory iceberg of interesting music that has been written for
keyboard during the past 400 years.</LD>
<LD>   There are almost limitless discoveries to be made, and it turns
out that we miss a lot.</LD>
<LD>   Below is a look at little-known, and in some cases downright
obscure, work by composers (some of whom are also downright obscure)
that has fallen below the standard repertory radar.</LD>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   ANTOINE FORQUERAY</TE>
<TE>   Suites for Harpsichord</TE>
<TE>   Christophe Rousset,</TE>
<TE>   harpsichord</TE>
<TE>   Decca</TE>
<TE>   Forqueray's life and music are enigmas. The Baroque composer, who
was born in 1672 and died in 1745, wrote but five suites. Together,
they make up about 2 1/2 hours of music and were published
posthumously by his son in two versions, one for viola da gamba and
harpsichord, and the other transcribed for harpsichord alone.</TE>
<TE>   Who did the transcribing, and even who did the composing are not
entirely clear (his son and second wife have both been proposed as
candidates).</TE>
<TE>   Here's what we do know: Forqueray was an unpleasant character, a
wife-beater who had his son imprisoned for gambling and theft. And we
know this: The suites in their harpsichord version are flights of
marvelous fancy worthy of standing next to those by Rameau.</TE>
<TE>   All the movements to the five suites are named after
contemporaries (such as Couperin and Rameau), places, instruments or
mythological figures. There is progression through the works from
simplicity to extravagant bravura. "Jupiter," the last movement of
Suite No. 5, is harpsichord music at its most dazzling. Forqueray had
gifts for melody, harmony and sound effects.</TE>
<TE>   The harpsichord is not always a colorful instrument, but here it
is an auditory rainbow, especially when played with Rousset's joie de
vivre.</TE>

<TE>   ANATOLY ALEXANDROV: Piano Music</TE>
<TE>   Hamish Milne, piano</TE>

<TE>   The obscurity of composer Anatoly Alexandrov is a penalty of his
living most of his life in the Soviet Union without being either a
persecuted musical innovator or an honored political hack.</TE>
<TE>   His work embodies no overtly tortured persona, but neither is it
devoid of a strong personal voice. Imagine Rachmaninoff purged of his
romanticism, pursuing formal designs. The results are interesting and
substantial, if not ultimately compelling and top-drawer. The disc
spans the Opus One preludes, published in 1916, and two (of seven
planned) Visions of 1979. (He died in 1982.) Hamish Milne is a strong
advocate for this music, which helps fill out the history of music in
our time. Chris Pasles</TE>

<TE>   Sonata in E Minor; Passacaglia</TE>
<TE>   Marc-Andre Hamelin, piano</TE>
<TE>   Hyperion</TE>
<TE>   Godowsky was celebrated in his lifetime as a hyper-virtuoso
pianist. As a composer, he is famed mostly for 53 transformations of
Chopin's Etudes, but his massive, five-movement sonata, occupying 47
minutes in Hamelin's exciting performance, is worth a listen. It's a
tasteful, highly attractive work in an eclectic style owing something
to Brahms, Granados, Richard Strauss, Franck and Rachmaninoff.
Despite its length, it is not so much monumental as lighthearted,
transparent in texture if demanding technically. It owes more to the
salon than to the temple. The Passacaglia--described as "44
variations, cadenza and fugue on the opening of Schubert's
'Unfinished' Symphony"--is relentlessly clever, occasionally witty,
often beautiful. For the pianist, like Hamelin, with technique to
burn, it is an 18-minute showpiece. Daniel Cariaga</TE>

<TE>   "Stephen Hough's English Piano Album"</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Hough, piano</TE>
<TE>   Hyperion</TE>
<TE>   Following up his "New Piano Album" with a more specific focus,
Hough turns in a collection of mostly pleasant, occasionally
challenging 20th century English music, assembled from 1997-vintage
leftovers from the aforementioned album and additional recordings
from 2001. The disc is bookended by Alan Rawsthorne's now-rampaging,
now-coy or whimsical Bagatelles and Kenneth Leighton's rugged,
brilliantly percussive Six Studies, which surround a sequence of
often gentle, at times sentimental musings of fluctuating interest.
Only one major composer--Elgar, with "In Smyrna"--is represented. The
most immediately appealing music is Hough's own pair of "Valse
Enigmatiques," the first of which has a memorable motif that would
have been at home in Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music."</TE>

<TE>   Seeger would undoubtedly have become a major American composer had
she written more. She died relatively young at 52 (in 1953) and was
busy as wife, mother (Pete was a stepson) and folk-music collector.
Still, she left us some gems, like the Nine Preludes, mystically
bewitching pieces in the modern dissonant style of the 1920s. Jenny
Lin's disc provides perspective, featuring all of Seeger's piano
music, much of it juvenilia. Among the works is a fascinating piano
score she wrote in 1925 to accompany a recitation of "The Adventures
of Tom Thumb," which foreshadows her growing interest in folk music.
The performances are solid and satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill, a more characterful and probing pianist, sticks just with
the preludes and "Piano Study in Mixed Accents," a galloping
one-minute mini-masterpiece. But she also provides a survey of
Beyer's piano music. A German American composer and musicologist in
Henry Cowell's circle, Beyer seems to have played a few of these
piano works in concerts in New York. But none of her music was
published during her lifetime, and she remains a little-known figure.
More biting than Seeger's Preludes, her "Dissonant Counterpoint" is a
set of angular and powerful pieces with a strong voice and the solid
urban feel of Depression-era New York. M.S.</TE>

<HD>It Was All Risque Innocence</HD>
<DH>The Vargas girl images were familiar to soldiers and
magazine readers. Now paintings and drawings of the pinups are up for
auction.</DH>

<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her legs are invariably long, and she seems to like looking coyly
over her shoulder. She's taut and saucy, self-possessed and
available--blond, brunet or redhead; clothed, barely, or absolutely
naked. For three decades, in the pages of Esquire and later in
Playboy, she was the luminous icon of male American fantasy.</LD>
<LD>   She is one of thousands of pinups created by Joaquin Alberto
Vargas y Chavez, lovely creatures known as Vargas girls. Vargas' use
of airbrush lent his paintings a sleek, vibrant quality, and his
innocent but daring poses gained immense popularity with young
soldiers during World War II. With time, she was elevated from
cheesecake to Americana. In a monograph on the artist, novelist Kurt
Vonnegut is quoted on Vargas girls. They "bear little resemblance to
real women," he wrote, "as they have no underarm hair or minor skin
blemishes, have legs a third again as long as any women save for
Africa's Watusis, and so could not possibly remind us of the mothers
and sisters and sweethearts and wives we were supposedly fighting
for."</LD>
<TE>   Today and later this week, at two auctions in Los Angeles, a cache
of original Vargas girls is going on the block. Ten paintings owned
by the Playboy Corp. will be sold as part of a larger sale of the
magazine's archives at Butterfields starting at noon, and 36 original
paintings and drawings from the artist's estate will be part of a
sale at Santa Monica Auctions next Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Berman, proprietor of Santa Monica Auctions, says his lot
is "the largest collection of Vargas' originals ever offered at
auction." The 36 works survey the illustrator's career from his
demure fashion poses of the 1920s through the risque 1960s. Berman
says, "As far as American illustrators, no one comes close to his
style and technique in capturing the elegance, beauty and sensuality
of the 20th century woman."</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields' director of 20th century decorative arts, Peter
Loughrey, agrees. "I think that the Vargas pictures from the Playboy
era are the standard by which the market judges other pinup and
illustration art. It became the epitome of the style."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas was inspired by what he saw as the beauty of American women
to make a career of painting them. When he first arrived in New York
City, he recalled walking up Broadway when "boom! The doors opened
and out they poured, more and more. I'd never seen so many beautiful
girls in one spot in my life."</TE>
<TE>   The Peruvian-born son of a professional photographer, Vargas as a
youth used an airbrush to touch up his father's prints. His wealthy
family sent him to Switzerland for an education, but Vargas found
that his passion was painting. The outbreak of World War I led him to
move to New York in 1916. Despite speaking little English, he
supported himself throughout the 1920s by painting Ziegfeld Follies
stars for their promotional magazine.</TE>
<TE>   After marrying chorus girl Anna May Clift in 1930, he said, "I
drew those girls but I didn't love them," adding that his wife "was
the one I loved." She modeled for him but also invited other
attractive young women to pose because Vargas did not use
professionals. "When they come to the studio," he once explained,
"Mrs. Vargas is always there to put them at their ease."</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, Vargas and his wife moved to Hollywood, where he designed
movie posters for 20th Century Fox. In 1936, they bought a house in
Westwood, where they lived, for the most part, for the rest of their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas did not fully capitalize on his talent for accentuating the
voluptuous beauty of women until 1940, when he was discovered by
Esquire's founder and publisher, David Smart, who was looking for a
pinup artist to appeal to the magazine's largely male audience.</TE>
<TE>   In the October 1940 issue, Vargas' full-length buxom blond in
black lingerie was featured as a gatefold, a fold-out color
reproduction set into the magazine. Two months later, according to
Esquire, the magazine's circulation had increased by 100,000; the
editors' assumed the pinups helped. Smart convinced the artist to
drop the "s" from his name to make it more "euphonious," and "Varga
girls" appeared monthly in the magazine and on Esquire promotional
material. In 1946, the artist had a falling-out with Smart over
ownership of the name "Varga." The artist lost the subsequent lawsuit
and all rights to the name. He then reverted to his legal name,
Vargas, when signing his artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The incident derailed Vargas' career and over the next decade,
with fewer commissions, he channeled his energy into painting
then-uncommercial nudes. In 1956, he took his paintings to the
publisher of a new magazine in Chicago called Playboy. Hugh Hefner
published five pages of them in the March 1957 issue, and the artist
appeared regularly in the magazine from 1960 until after his wife
died in 1974, when he retired. In 1982, he died at age 87 at his
Westwood home.</TE>
<TE>   Berman obtained the original paintings and drawings for the Santa
Monic Auctions' sale directly from the Vargas estate. Because Vargas
and his wife had no children, some 1,000 original works and thousands
of prints were left to his nephew, Max Vargas, and his niece, Astrid
Conte. They worked together in selling and licensing work until the
early 1990s, when they began to disagree. Max Vargas sued Conte in
1994 for his half of the estate but died shortly thereafter. His
widow, Marsha Vargas, pursued the lawsuit, which was resolved in her
favor in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Marsha Vargas consigned the 36 originals to Santa Monica Auctions.
One of the highlights is a large, full-length nude titled "Big
Blonde" from 1949, with an estimated value of $100,000 to $150,000.
Part of a series called "Legacy Nudes," Berman considers it one of
the most collectible pieces, because of its size and condition.</TE>
<TE>   A striking 1919 image of a redhead reclining on a tiger skin rug
and holding a black kitten up in her arms is estimated at $60,000 to
$80,000. Some of the mid-size works are estimated at between $25,000
and $50,000, but there are works with estimates as low as $6,000,
including a draft of a 1965 drawing, "Love Child," done for Playboy.</TE>
<TE>   Berman offers the Vargas pieces in the context of a sale he calls
"The Art of Commerce," which mixes the commercial art created for
advertising and magazines with the fine art usually displayed in
galleries and museums. He calls it "the ultimate high/low auction."
Apart from Vargas, the sale features more than 500 lots, including
works by well-known illustrators such as the late Antonio Lopez, who
made a portrait of his friend Andy Warhol. On the fine art side,
Berman is offering limited edition works by Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein,
James Rosenquist and David Hockney.</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields' auction of original art from the Playboy Magazine
Archives includes 10 original Vargas illustrations, with estimates
ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. The Playboy paintings are more
revealing than the Esquire works--they "have an air of worldly
sophistication," according to the Vargas monograph. For one thing,
they include the magazine's double-entendre captions. A bare-breasted
woman dressed as Batgirl is mischievously titled "Dynamic Duo," and a
brunet in a pink negligee, wearing high heels (naturally) is
captioned "My Husband Is on the Way Up, Darling. Do You Know How to
Sell Fuller Brushes or Something?"</TE>
<TE>   Vargas was not the original focus of the Butterfields sale.
Loughrey says that the Playboy Corp. originally approached
Butterfields to sell illustrations it had commissioned from Warhol
because the cost of restoring them seemed excessive for material they
intended to keep in storage. "It was a case of a nonperforming asset
that the company could use to raise money," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After discussions with the auction house, Playboy decided to sell
a larger portion of its archive, including photographs, club keys,
memorabilia and a rare Bunny costume. The Vargas originals, however,
are among the rarest items in the auction.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with the Playboy material made me a fan even though I
never bought one of the magazines," Loughrey says. "It helped me
understand how influential the magazine was over the last 50 years in
shaping people's lifestyles."</TE>
<TE>   Louis Meisel, proprietor of Meisel Gallery in New York City and
author of the 1996 Taschen book "The Great American Pin-Up," says the
L.A. auctions estimates are high.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' auction record, Meisel says, "at Sotheby's, is under
$20,000. And the market is small, so people in L.A. will get some
good buys."</TE>

<LD>Paulina Rubio's act ("She's Ready (She Says)," by Agustin Gurza,
June 9) plays right into the hands of the satyriastic macho mind-set.
Will she realize at some point that by using sexual suggestiveness to
promote herself, she's teetering dangerously close to standard male
corporate exploitation of women?</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Madonna, whose career has been filled with carefully
crafted subversions, Rubio's cliched music and image contradict her
feminist ideals, and how does this empower women? Patti Smith can do
it with poetry and intelligence. Sheryl Crow can do it without
exposing more than bare feet. Lydia Lunch can be sexy just by walking
on stage and speaking her mind, Julieta Venegas by having more
creative depth. Even so, I have no doubt Rubio will be a hit. The
public wants what the public gets.</LD>

<LD>Lynn Smith and Kevin Crust should be ashamed that they discussed film
festivals in Los Angeles ("A Banner Event?," June 16) and the aspect
of diversity, and did not mention the Pan African Film Festival. It
occurs every February, usually at the Baldwin Hills Magic Johnson
Theatre. It's been around for about 10 years. Since you mentioned the
Outfest several times even though it is not a mainstream audience
event, you should have acknowledged the Pan African event.</LD>

<LD>Having served as the public relations/public information director for
both the L.A. County Museum of Art and the Los Angeles Public
Library, I read Christopher Knight's long overdue proposal to do away
with the museum's admission fee with great interest ("Why Pay to See
Our Own Art?," June 9). His idea is bold, appropriate, and probably
very unwelcome to museum and government officials.</LD>
<LD>   Public libraries have a long tradition of considering themselves
the people's university. Their history of serving those without
money, status or even education is one of the great American stories.
On the other hand, art museums, especially LACMA, have a strong
elitist tradition that has undergone some change in recent years but
hardly enough. By the time I came to LACMA in 1970, the leadership
understood the need to adopt the rhetoric of serving a broader public
in the face of major social changes, but couldn't quite muster the
will to make the appropriate policy changes.</LD>
<TE>   Museum admission fees are clearly most hurtful to those least able
to afford them. Think of how the public and the politicians would
explode if just the downtown public library were to establish an

<HD>Big Bands' Fate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is about time someone of Don Heckman's stature wrote of our sad
musical state of affairs ("The Big-Band Survival Kit," June 16).
Heckman lists four reasons for the demise of big bands. I would like
to add two:</LD>
<LD>   American Federation of Musicians President James Caesar Petrillo
called for a musicians' strike that lasted more than a year right at
the height of big bands' popularity (August 1942 to November 1943).
No big band records were made except those recorded and sent to U.S.
servicemen overseas (V Discs). There was another strike in 1948.
After that, the music changed slowly at first, with Stan Kenton
playing bebop. The style stopped people from dancing, and dancing was
part of the reason for the existence of big bands. All the bands were
dance bands (except Ellington)--Isham Jones, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher
Henderson, Glen Gray. Each had its own sound and, hot or sweet, the
kids danced.</LD>
<LD>   Almost all of the big band musicians started out playing in their
colleges, and maybe if the musicians union could back off, the kids
would be allowed to form a band and play in a local hotel for a
modest salary and some big bands may start to swing.</LD>
<TE>   Let's face it. We have thrown away the best form of popular music
this country has ever known, all for the likes of a bunch of
"cretins" (Sinatra's term) who have polluted popular music with rock
'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   MARTY CAPUNE</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although perhaps well meaning, Heckman's article about the state
of big bands as well as his subsequent reviews of a number of large
ensemble discs fail to even mention the stellar work of valve
trombonist-composer-arranger Bob Brookmeyer and his New Art
Orchestra. "Celebration," the Brookmeyer ensemble's first CD,
received the U.K. equivalent of a Grammy several years ago. The
group's new CD, "Waltzing With Zoe," received four stars recently in
these very pages by critic Howard Reich.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of such a glaring omission by Heckman, Brookmeyer's
influence as one of the giants of large-ensemble jazz continues to be
far-reaching. Sure, you can't name everyone, but at least include
those who have helped to keep large-ensemble jazz alive despite all
odds, including corporate ignorance and critical biases.</TE>

<LD>As someone who would pay to see anything that Neil Simon wrote (or
might still write), I must comment on the female version of "The Odd
Couple" ("Looking Up Old Friends," by Barbara Isenberg, June 16). I
was fortunate to go to the first paid performance of that edition,
starring Rita Moreno and Sally Struthers, and Neil Simon was sitting
about 10 rows in front of us, still "fine-tuning" the play with two
associates. To most of us, the presentation was funny and interesting
but failed to work due to one very definite reason: Sally Struthers'
performance. Had a stronger actress been working against Rita
Moreno's stellar performance, we might have been rewarded with a
female version of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's hilarious warfare.
Alas, Moreno's wonderful energy was never returned. Simon's words
remain as strong as ever, but, clearly, casting is as much of the
game as the writing in legitimate theater.</LD>

<LD>While the article on "The Women" ("The Claws Are Out," by John Clark,
June 9) gives full credit to playwright Clare Boothe Luce, it
compares the play with "George Cukor's film adaptation." Cukor did
indeed direct the film, but it was adapted for the screen--and rather
substantially tweaked, as there were censors to consider in 1939--by
Anita Loos and Jane Murfin. In fact, Cukor insisted Loos be on the
set throughout the filming.</LD>
<LD>   I had to laugh the next day when a Calendar piece on the Writers
Guild Foundation's Words to Picture Conference implied that writers
were complaining unjustly about people being "indifferent to their
talent." It's doubly difficult when it is writers who dismiss--or
just plain forget--other writers.</LD>

<HD>Groomed to Be All That</HD>
<DH>At Disney and Nick, youngsters are carefully scouted and
prepped for stardom. They even take classes on how to deal with fans.</DH>

<LD>For Lisa Foiles, a dance recital isn't just a dance recital anymore.</LD>
<LD>   While waiting for her cue in the wings of a hall near her
Riverside home one recent evening, the freckled 15-year-old was taken
by surprise: The youngsters she was following skipped offstage--and
did a double-take. "You're the girl on 'All That'!" one shrieked.</LD>
<LD>   "They waited for me to finish, and then there were 30 or 40 little
girls around me [with] pieces of paper for me to autograph," Lisa
said. "They asked me all kinds of things--they wanted to know if I
have a limousine."</LD>
<TE>   This is Lisa's life since she debuted last January as a cast
member on "All That," the Nickelodeon cable network's prime-time
sketch comedy series. Thanks to television's efficient and pervasive
child-star system, she's already a bona fide superstar--at least in
the eyes of the show's target demographic, 6- to 12-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Every Saturday night, about 3.3 million viewers tune in to "All
That" to watch Lisa's characters--the coffee-wired talk-show host
Kaffy and the funereally gothic Claudia--cavort in an ensemble of
child comics along with guest stars such as Britney Spears and
Frankie Muniz. Lisa is a product of one of television's two big
child-star factories. Nickelodeon and Disney Channel, which supply a
major share of programming for the up-to-12 demographic, also
nurture, package and deliver young stars to your home in a process
that hums with efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   And so Lisa has not only taken countless hours of singing, dancing
and acting lessons, she's even taken a course on how to be a child
star--a series of workshops and classes on how to act professionally,
deal with production crews, talk to the press and handle crowds of
her eager young fans when she's spotted in public.</TE>
<TE>   Nick and Disney Channel executives say they have only a few dozen
full-fledged child stars each, sifted from about 35,000 child members
of the Screen Actors Guild. So when young performers are plucked from
crowded casting rooms for plum jobs, little is left to chance.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa's big break came a year ago from writer-producer Dan
Schneider. Round-faced and multitalented--he broke in as a teenage
actor on the 1986 ABC series "Head of the Class"--Schneider was
picking a new cast for season seven of "All That." The show, which he
co-created, has become something of a talent incubator at
Nickelodeon, making stars out of Amanda Bynes, Kenan Thompson and Kel
Mitchell, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said he believed that "All That," which debuted in 1994,
had grown tired in recent seasons, so he and network executives
agreed to start fresh with an all-new cast and new sketches for the
season, which was launched in January. Nick executives were pleased
by the result and ordered an eighth season, which went into
production Monday, thanks to a double-digit rebound in ratings for
the new format.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great cast, but Lisa's one that a lot of people are
talking about," says Schneider, who also works on features films
("Big Fat Liar"). Lisa stood out among several hundred youngsters who
auditioned for the new cast. Stuffing her cheeks with marshmallows,
she did an impression of diminutive comic Buddy Hackett.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many kids her age even know who Buddy Hackett is," Schneider
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new cast started with a two-week comedy boot camp that
Schneider held with help of a team that included the show's dialogue
coach, Brian Peck.</TE>
<TE>   "Lisa has tremendous enthusiasm. She's a natural," said Peck, who
is also an actor and voice-over artist. And, true to the aphorism
that no detail is too small for a successful production, Nick brought
in veteran Hollywood wardrobe stylist Janet Planet to costume the
cast for some "Kids Choice" promotional segments. She immediately
picked up on Lisa's on-camera appeal, dressing her in an elegant pink
crocheted sweater.</TE>
<TE>   The way that producers and executives lavish attention on Lisa is
typical of the way Nick and Disney treat their top-drawer talent,
said longtime Hollywood child-talent manager T.J. Stein. But more
important, he says, the young performers on the two major kids'
networks also get better roles.</TE>
<TE>   Stein, who has clients on network and cable shows, and in feature
films, said he finds that prime-time network shows commonly use young
actors as "furniture"--that is, story lines don't go through them
very often. "I tell kids, 'Do you want to be part of the furniture?
You're not going to Disney Channel or Nickelodeon for the money,' "
Stein said. "You add it up, the experience you're going to get and
the exposure" on the cable channels is superior.</TE>
<TE>   Nick trains its young performers with an orientation course titled
Nick Talent 101, said Paula Kaplan, Nick's senior vice president of
talent. The course is made up of workshops, meetings and class-like
sessions supplemented with a workbook that the freshly minted stars
carry around for the first couple of weeks after they start work.</TE>
<TE>   "When we pick up a show, the first couple of weeks we sit down
with each kid and their parents," said Kaplan. "We go through the
definition of terms, the language of production, like, 'What's a
grip?'--and also we say here's what's going to happen to you being a
star, out in public."</TE>
<TE>   Child stars and their older counterparts in show business live in
two different worlds. "If adults see a celebrity they know," Kaplan
said, "they'll look, they'll stare, they'll comment on how they look
or who they're with, but only about one in five will go up and say
something, like, 'I love your work.' But being a star is different
for kids; that filter is gone. They see celebrities, other kid stars,
they feel that they know them or think they're their friend. So
they'll all go right up to them, touch them and ask for things,"
Kaplan said. "It's hard to prepare a kid for that."</TE>
<TE>   Nick 101, which Kaplan designed, gets the young stars thinking
about answers to the questions they'll be asked by fans and
reporters. The book poses a list of such questions they can expect to
hear. There's always the limousine question (Lisa, as an example,
doesn't have one). Also, "what's your favorite movie?" (Lisa's is
"Big Fat Liar.") "Do you have a boyfriend?" (Lisa doesn't.) "Where do
you go to school?" (Lisa is home-schooled.)</TE>
<TE>   The book offers advice. "You may not want to give your exact home
address," it suggests sagely. As for the girl or boyfriend question,
the book suggests, "Some people like to keep that information
private." And Nick 101 urges the young stars not to let their guard
down. "It's very important to remember that you represent both
Nickelodeon and your project to the public at all times," the
workbook advises. "Please do not say negative things about your
fellow cast members, the crew, the producers or other shows." Most
kid performers say contact with the public is usually enjoyable, only
rarely wearying--and occasionally comes in handy.</TE>
<TE>   In the upper floors of the Disney Channel's high-rise in Burbank,
Gary Marsh, executive vice president of original programming and
production, is eager to find the next big kid star. But newcomers
find that the bar has been raised. Marsh said that 14-year-old Hilary
Duff, for one, is accessible, mature and terrifically talented. She
has already parlayed her success on the Disney series "Lizzie
McGuire" into two starring roles in feature film projects. She is due
to begin production later in the summer on the MGM film "Agent Cody
Bank," and she has signed for a role in a New Line Cinema movie in
development titled "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen." In
addition, Disney is developing a "Lizzie McGuire" feature.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids who make it through to here are the Navy SEALs of the
kid talent," Marsh said. "They are thoroughly trained, ferociously
talented and tenacious. It's not by accident they rise to the top."
Another Disney executive, Adam Bonnett, vice president of original
programming, said he's continually on the lookout for new talent.</TE>
<TE>   "We do quarterly showcases, internal showcases, we work with
casting directors ... we're always looking," Bonnett said. "I'll see
kids in guest star roles, we'll tell our in-house talent exec to
track that kid down, let's meet with them, bring them in and cast
them."</TE>
<TE>   Once kids are stars, they'll venture out in the normal world like
Lisa at the dance recital--encountering an often too-eager public.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, for every Lisa or Hilary, there are thousands of kids
who can't break into a steady role in Hollywood. Take 14-year-old
Sara Paxton. She's had a number of good parts that have attracted
attention--a supporting role in a Disney made-for-TV movie titled
"Hounded" and another as a sexually exploited child in a recent
episode of CBS's "CSI." She's starred in two pilots that weren't
picked up--one in a role opposite Debbie Reynolds--and she stars
opposite Christopher Lloyd in a 3-D attraction movie that will be
shown starting next year at Sea World in San Diego and at other Busch
Entertainment Corp. theme parks. But she hasn't landed a big break
like the one that came to Lisa.</TE>
<TE>   "I've auditioned about 20 times for all these different Disney
Channel things ... but I don't get discouraged," Sara said
determinedly. "There's always going to be another chance. You've got
to keep trying for the next one." She gamely works on despite casting
directors who don't call her back, and another antagonistic force:
getting older.</TE>
<TE>   Take Jeremy Foley, who broke in as Linda Hamilton's son in the
1997 feature film "Dante's Peak" and later earned a leading role on
"Caitlin's Way," a dramatic series that ran for two years on Nick.
Now 19, he's struggling to forge a career as a young adult.
"Everybody was saying our show was getting good reviews, good
reviews, I thought it was awesome," Foley recalls. Now, though, it's
back to square one. He gets as many readings as he can, he takes
acting classes, occasionally lands a guest spot--he was recently on
"Boston Public"--but life now seems far from certain. No big break
has come his way, so he is planning to attend film school.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, 18-year-old Christy Carlson Romano, a star of the
series "Even Stevens," said she's gotten used to young girls chanting
"Ren! Ren!"--the name of her character. But she was in a video store
recently, she said, and had forgotten her membership card. When a
clerk seemed uncertain about her identity, Romano turned to a group
of young girls in line behind her.</TE>
<TE>   "Who am I, kids?" Romano asked them.</TE>
<TE>   She got her videos.</TE>

<HD>Been There, Felt That</HD>
<DH>Emily Mortimer knows what it's like to be an insecure
actress. To play one in 'Lovely &amp; Amazing,' she had to examine those
feelings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emily Mortimer is making a mental checklist of her anatomical
shortcomings. "Knock-kneed, one eye's smaller than the other," she
says. "My teeth are a bit yellow, nose is a bit big, flat hair,
thin." Not that the 30-year-old Oxford graduate suffers from a bad
self-image, it's just that for her latest role as a neurotic Angeleno
actress in Nicole Holofcener's "Lovely &amp; Amazing," she had to put any
normal, working actor's sense of vanity on the line.</LD>
<LD>   Mortimer plays Elizabeth Marks, whose acting career is finally
taking off now that her agent has pressured her into sexing up her
image for auditions and magazine shoots. Naturally, the role hit
home. "I've definitely been in some absurd outfit with a thousand
people staring at you, feeling totally miserable like you want
someone to come and collect you and take you home," she says. "And
the whole thing about auditioning and feeling like you've got the job
because somebody flirted outrageously with you and then you haven't.
There are many instances where you kind of feel like a whore. And
what was interesting about doing this job is that I examined all
that, and in the process, I did expose myself and make myself very
vulnerable."</LD>
<TE>   Elizabeth also has a lot of pressure from her family: a caustic
and unhappily married older sister (Catherine Keener), an adopted
10-year-old African American sister who wants blond hair (Raven
Goodwin), and a mother (Brenda Blethyn) undergoing liposuction. It's
enough to make Elizabeth question the skin she's in, especially in
the film's most revealing scene: After bedding a handsome A-list
actor (Dermot Mulroney)--whose latest project she didn't get,
ironically, because she wasn't deemed sexy enough--she boldly stands
naked before him and asks him to honestly critique her anatomy. It's
the most provocative but desexualized piece of female nudity in indie
film since Julianne Moore went bottomless in 1993's "Short Cuts." Yet
there's nothing casual and incidental about this scene. It's full
frontal and head-on uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that if I wanted to do the part, I would have to do the
scene. But I remember getting out of bed at that moment in the scene,
thinking, 'This better be a good film,' " Mortimer says, with a
laugh. "If this is a good film, it's all right. But if it isn't, I'm
destined for international humiliation." While the scene was in the
original script, Mortimer worked with Holofcener on rewriting it to
specifically tailor it to her own complaints about her body. "I had
to sit down and think about all the things that freak me out about my
body," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, aside from her willowy, skinny frame, which many
actresses would kill for, it's hard to see any flaws in Mortimer's
porcelain-featured beauty. "The script originally called for someone
with fat thighs and a round belly, someone with a more normal body
than Emily," Holofcener says. "But I wanted her so much for the part
that I rationalized that it doesn't really matter what she looks
like. There's plenty of hyper-thin actresses out there who think
they're fat and would make us all throw up if we heard them. So I
thought, 'Well, let her be one of those.' And she did it
beautifully."</TE>
<TE>   The scene was shot without rehearsals--true to the chaos of indie
film, the entire shoot was only three weeks--and with a minimal
amount of takes so that Mortimer wouldn't be naked for long. "There
were maybe five people there, all men besides me and Emily,"
Holofcener says, "all kind of courteously looking away, like the boom
operator's trying to boom them without looking. Everyone felt very
protective of her."</TE>
<TE>   Mortimer admits she has a lot in common with the insecure
Elizabeth. One of the character's biggest quirks is that she's always
taking in stray dogs, whether they want to be rescued. Mortimer
confides she has similar obsessions. "I worry constantly about being
a good person," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her "Lovely &amp; Amazing" co-star Brenda Blethyn, who also plays her
mother in the as-yet-unreleased "The Sleeping Dictionary," vouches
for her. "Oh yes!" she says. "She sent me quite a big check the other
day because I run the London Marathon for children with leukemia. But
I think it was because it made her laugh so much that I was running a
marathon."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Mortimer's preoccupation with civic duty led her to
volunteer at a London refuge for Russian asylum seekers. Fluent in
Russian from her days at Oxford, she went to help. "I thought, 'Oh
brilliant! I can exorcise my guilt,' " she says jokingly. "Of course,
in a desperate bid to be liked, I had given everybody my number. I
was hounded for six months and I had about five or six regulars,
sweet old men that I'd be driving to dental appointments in Lewisham.
In the end, I just had to drop them. I felt so desperate, like, 'My
God, I'm not good enough to do good work.' "</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Oxfordshire, Mortimer is the daughter of famed
writer and barrister John Mortimer ("Rumpole of the Bailey") and
Penelope, a homemaker mom. Despite play-acting detergent commercials
on the stairs for her parents as a little girl, she never seriously
considered the profession.</TE>
<TE>   At the age of 17, she went on a trip to Russia and fell in love
with the country. "Moscow has this strange effect on English
middle-class schoolgirls," she says. "It really was an extraordinary
thing for me because I led this very protected life up until then. It
was my coming of age, and it coincided with Russia's coming of age in
a weird way because the wall had just come down and everything was
changing." In 1990, she entered Lincoln College at Oxford University
to study English literature, and in her third year she became a
double major, adding Russian to her curriculum and spending two terms
at the Moscow Arts Theater Drama School.</TE>
<TE>   During her senior year in Oxford in 1994, a classmate's mother who
was a William Morris agent saw her in a school play and began sending
her on auditions. She made her debut the following year in a TV
miniseries, a period potboiler titled "Catherine Cookson's The Glass
Virgin"--"I was the Glass Virgin," she says, groaning. "Suddenly I
was running about on some moor in a bodice and being paid an awful
lot of money. And it was kind of like, 'Well, I'll just sort of do
this until....' It was like a holiday job or something to pass the
time and amuse my friends."</TE>
<TE>   But subsequent roles followed in BBC miniseries and TV movies,
including a starring role as an oversexed, emotionally troubled young
woman in a PBS Masterpiece Theater production of "Cider With Rosie"
(1998), written by her father. She did theater, and received glowing
notices for her work in "The Lights" at London's Royal Court Theatre
and as Portia in "The Merchant of Venice" at Edinburgh's Lyceum
Theatre. She also began appearing in a string of high-profile
Hollywood films, although those roles were largely blink and miss
starting with her 1996 stint as Val Kilmer's wife in "The Ghost and
the Darkness."</TE>
<TE>   "I was definitely the wife," she says. "It was my third job ever
and I was sent to South Africa to do like three scenes. I said, 'I'll
miss you.' And 'Write me.' And, 'Go on, you can do it, you build your
bridges.' It wasn't exactly an Oscar-winning performance.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mortimer found herself landing more small roles in more
prominent films. She played Cate Blanchett's devoted lady-in-waiting
in "Elizabeth," and a spoiled actress who is gutted in "Scream 3." "I
loved it. It was hilarious to audition for it, this preppy, geeky
girl from Oxfordshire. It was an extraordinary feeling to get
slashed. Because you don't realize how you haven't screamed since you
were a tiny thing. I'm sure people pay therapists in order to be able
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   And in "Notting Hill," she played Perfect Girl, a slight variation
on her lovely West London self, although Hugh Grant passed her over
for Julia Roberts. "I felt that was kind of justified," Mortimer
says. "She's a movie star."</TE>
<TE>   The bit-player work lead to meatier roles in undistinguished fare,
including Bruce Willis' love interest in "The Kid" and a job in
Kenneth Branagh's all-singing, all-dancing Busby Berkeley riff on
Shakespeare's "Love's Labour's Lost." "Luckily, all I had to do was
shuffle around a bit in the background," she says. Although the film
was a flop, it was also fortuitous for introducing her to actor
Alessandro Nivola, her boyfriend of three years; she commutes to his
Hollywood Hills home from her flat in Ladbroke Grove. "I'm still
resisting not calling London my home," she confesses. "I do really
like it here, it's just that I like to leave as well. It's just
important to me that I feel there are other things going on in the
world and not just a tiny scary environment."</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest roles are on their way. This fall, she plays a villain
in the big-budget sci-fi thriller "Formula 51," directed by Hong Kong
action auteur Ronny Yu. "I play a gun-toting motorbike-riding hit
woman all in leather," she says proudly. When asked if she was
daunted by her fighting scenes with roughnecks Samuel L. Jackson and
Robert Carlyle, she laughs. "They're just babies, really."</TE>
<TE>   Mortimer just finished shooting "Young Adam," a moody drama about
'50s-era beatniks in Glasgow with Ewan McGregor and Tilda Swinton.
"It is based on a novel, kind of a Glaswegian 'On the Road,' " she
says. "It's misanthropic and kind of worrying because it's totally
amoral. There are no real boundaries and you're really unsure where
it stands. The film doesn't make any judgments."</TE>
<TE>   She's also quietly following in her father's footsteps with a
career as a writer. She penned a fiction column for the London Daily
Telegraph in the voice of a struggling young actress who invariably
says or does the wrong thing, and she's tackling her first
screenplay, an adaptation of Lorna Sage's harrowing girlhood memoir,
"Bad Blood," to be directed by Hettie MacDonald ("Beautiful Thing").</TE>
<TE>   For someone who seems to have stumbled into acting, it sounds as
though Mortimer has learned how to hatch more of a master plan. "I
have recently started to get a strategy," she admits. "Because I
finally realized I did an awful lot of, 'Isn't it hilarious? I'm
wearing this wig and running through the moors.' It was kind of funny
but not funny if you're going to carry on doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Mortimer says she's been pleased with the sensitivity the press
has shown her during her publicity appearances for "Lovely &amp;
Amazing," but she concedes that her next film, "Formula 51," is
fodder for Stuff and Maxim magazines.</TE>
<TE>   "That's much more boys-magazine type stuff, so that's involved
quite a lot of saying no to those kinds of things," she says. "I
don't feel comfortable wearing bikinis in photo shoots, but it's so
nerve-racking to say never. It's so hard to have integrity. I don't
even know what it really means in this profession. But one thing it
is for me is being open to suggestion and not boring yourself or
other people. Being able to be more than one thing. And seeing where
that takes you."</TE>

<HD>A Grisly Subject, a Serious Filmmaker</HD>
<DH>'Dahmer's' writer-director went his own way in what could
be a case study for indie production today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you want to make a serious movie about one of the nation's most
infamous serial killers that charts the psychological terrain leading
to his rampage but avoids grisly exploitation? And release it in the
midst of a blockbuster summer?</LD>
<LD>   The making--and selling--of "Dahmer," which debuted in Los Angeles
on Friday, is virtually a how-to of independent filmmaking today, in
both the obstacles it presented and how they were overcome.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, writer-director David Jacobson read Lionel Dahmer's "A
Father's Story," which explored his relationship with his son,
Jeffrey, who was convicted of the torture and murder of 17 young men
in Milwaukee, most of them Asian or African American. Dahmer's trail
of murders extended through the 1980s until his capture in the early
'90s. He was convicted of 17 murders in 1991 and sentenced to 957
years. In 1994, he was murdered by another inmate. "I was familiar
with who Jeffrey Dahmer was," says the 40-year-old Jacobson, whose
only previous credit was the 1994 black-and-white film "Criminal,"
which was well-received at film festivals and subsequently released
on video. "I always figured his story wasn't that different from any
other serial killer. But I became fascinated by his father's
approach."</LD>
<TE>   Like "Criminal," which charts the exploits of a balding,
40-year-old man who acts out his midlife crisis through criminal
behavior, a serious dramatization of Dahmer's life had little appeal
to producers and financiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still hear their reactions," Jacobson says, laughing. " 'Oh
my God, why would you make a film about that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Had he taken the low (exploitation) road, he says, there might
have been some interest, because Dahmer's crimes included
dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism. (By comparison, Hannibal
Lecter seems like a Noel Coward character.) But Jacobson's script was
a character study. "In a peculiar way, if I'd made a gory film, that
would have been more distancing [from the audience]. I was after
something more emotional and more involving."</TE>
<TE>   Almost no one wanted to be involved with that approach. Jacobson
decided to finance the movie himself, shooting it in suburban L.A.,
including his childhood home, over four weeks, mostly with unknowns.
The only "name" in the cast is Oscar-nominated actor Bruce Davison,
who portrays Lionel Dahmer. Some exteriors were shot in Dahmer's
hometown of Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The original budget was well below $1 million (it wound up at
about $1 million)and with the help of independent producer Larry
Rattner, Jacobson was able to secure some cost-efficient equipment
and post-production deals. "At the time we were shooting the film
last summer," Rattner says, "the threat of a strike had slowed
production down so much that we were able to negotiate very favorable
terms."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson was adamant about shooting on film, rather than the less
expensive digital video, which has become the rage in independent
filmmaking in the past few years. "I like some of the films I've seen
on digital, but I didn't think it would work well cinematically for
this subject," he says. "The story itself is so gritty, I wanted to
give people some pleasure in watching the film."</TE>
<TE>   With the film's director of photography, American Film Institute
graduate Chris Manley, Jacobson alternated two distinct film stocks,
using a smoother, more lush grain for flashback sequences dealing
with Dahmer's adolescence and a more high-contrast stock for the
intense later years, using a combination of sets and industrial
locations. After principal photography was completed, Rattner shopped
a rough cut of the movie. The initial response was predictable, but
once distributors viewed the film, the reaction was largely
favorable. Still, there were few offers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the interested parties wanted Jacobson to push the more
exploitative aspects of the movie, says the director. Then came an
offer from DEJ Productions, or "my Medicis," as Jacobson calls them.</TE>
<TE>   "DEJ was looking for quality films of this nature," Rattner said.
The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Blockbuster Home Video,
which since 1999 has buoyed the independent film arena, releasing
about 270 titles on video and DVD, according to Dean Wilson,
executive vice president of content for Blockbuster. "Dahmer" was a
perfect fit for Blockbuster because it downplayed the gore elements
and was able to secure an R-rating. The chain doesn't carry NC-17
titles.</TE>
<TE>   The video deal also included further funding to enhance the film's
post-production budget. Along with foreign sales, that covered most
of the film's expenses, Rattner says.</TE>
<TE>   Given the title's high recognition values--the press notes assert
that the American public is more familiar with the name Jeffrey
Dahmer than most past presidents--the filmmakers decided to attempt a
limited theatrical release in major cities. That would give "Dahmer"
higher visibility and secure reviews from major newspapers, which
rarely critique direct-to-video titles. With the video release set
for late summer, however, the only window of opportunity was
mid-summer, the most competitive period for film bookings.</TE>
<TE>   Again, exhibitors were initially reticent, particularly theaters
that book art-house fare, just the kind of venue that would give
"Dahmer" cachet with the more sophisticated moviegoing patron.
"Again, our biggest challenge was overcoming people's perceptions,"
says Doug Freed, a distribution consultant on the film. "But the
exhibitors I showed it to have responded." The movie was booked at
the Showcase on La Brea in Los Angeles and Manhattan's Angelika, two
highly sought-after venues for specialized fare.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Swain, executive producer of the film, who is in charge of
theatrical release, hopes to eventually secure release dates in the
top 20 U.S. cities. Given the sensational nature of the title, he
emphasizes that word-of-mouth will be essential. "People who have
seen it like the movie because it has style and honesty, and even
those who go in with expectations that it's an exploitation film are
nicely surprised. They come out even more disturbed because the film
is so real and because you get a true sense of who Dahmer was."</TE>
<TE>   If the New York and Los Angeles engagements attract good reviews
and solid business, bookings in the rest of the country may
follow--even in Milwaukee, where there is an entrenched resistance.
"Theaters in Milwaukee have been averse to booking the film so far
because it happened there," Swain says. "But audiences have a
fascination with this subject. They just need a good reason to see
it. If people realize that [Jacobson] took a tough, challenging
subject and did something unique with it, that [resistance] could be
overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson is enthusiastic about the film's theatrical potential and
the opportunity "to prove that everyone else was wrong. It's exciting
to make a film that no one would want to watch and have them find it
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   But even if it doesn't work, he shrugs, "at least I made my money
back." And in the independent world, where most movies never see any
kind of release, that alone is an accomplishment.</TE>

<DH>Behind the Flaming Lips' art rock are serious questions
about life and death.</DH>

<LD>If you or someone you know recently lost a loved one, and you're
talking to Flaming Lips leader Wayne Coyne about his band's
forthcoming album, "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots," you may find
yourself sharing depressing facts with the Oklahoma-based artist. For
despite the collection's science-fiction title, its musings on the
mysterious joys of life and love were inspired by the unexpected
death of a young Japanese fan two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But don't worry about the conversation turning bleak. Coyne will
be genuinely interested in your tale. He may even gently quiz you on
details. After all, you won't be the only one who felt compelled to
share.</LD>
<LD>   "The more I talk about the album to people who have been fans for
a long time, everybody gets into these stories about family members'
demises," says Coyne, 41. "I hope our music ... helps all that stuff
along."</LD>
<TE>   For nearly 20 years, the singer-guitarist and his
cohorts--currently  drummer Steven Drozd and bassist Michael
Ivins--have incorporated cosmic observations, epic soundscapes,
synapse-rattling noises, catchy melodies and grandly weird concepts
into their vibrant and surprisingly human, if not terribly
commercially successful art-rock.</TE>
<TE>   Still signed to Warner Bros. Records, where they landed a decade
ago following the major labels' post-Nirvana alt-rock feeding frenzy,
the trio is among the few survivors of the industry's late-'90s
merger purgings that set adrift many underperforming artists, both
mighty and minor. (They're part of Cake's Unlimited Sunshine Tour,
which comes to the Greek Theatre on Aug. 11.) Why did Flaming Lips
make the cut? Well, according to Coyne, they've just been fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always at death's door," he says. "And not because Warner
Bros. doesn't love us. A lot of people there would love nothing more
than for us to sell 100 million records. But the fact is, sometimes
we sell a lot of records, and sometimes we don't."</TE>
<TE>   More often, at least in terms of big-record-company numbers, they
don't. But in 1994, the Lips scored a Top 40 hit with the college
fave "She Don't Use Jelly." "Race for the Prize," from 1999's
critically acclaimed "The Soft Bulletin," helped boost the group's
popularity in Europe. Each time, the attendant sales increases were
apparently enough to let the Lips slide by.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're on the downward slope and [the label is] at the same
time, it doesn't matter if you're Elvis Costello or whatever," Coyne
says. "They just flatly go, 'That's the bottom line.' We would sell
records right when the dip would go down to its worst, so it always
seemed like the Lips escaped the chopping block one more time."</TE>
<TE>   Timing is a big part of the Lips' survival, but the record company
hasn't overlooked Coyne's way with a hook, notes David Katznelson, a
former Warner Bros. vice president of A&amp;R who brought the band to the
label as an intern. "He writes great pop songs, and [listeners] are
slowly gravitating to the Lips' talent," says Katznelson, now
president of the indie label Birdman Recording Group, Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, despite the general perception that record companies
value bankability over creativity, Katznelson says, "labels generally
like to have some bands around, like Spiritualized on Arista, that
are truly artistically applauded. The Lips always figure out
something that is both artful and noteworthy, and they put the WB
logo on almost everything they do. They're very proud of the
association, and I think the label likes that."</TE>
<TE>   The Flaming Lips' reputation for sonic lunacy probably figures
just as largely as "She Don't Use Jelly" in the minds of casual
observers, thanks to such stunts as a 1996 parking-lot experiment
involving a few dozen cars playing specially orchestrated music
through their tape decks, and 1997's "Zaireeka," a four-CD album
designed to be played simultaneously on different machines.</TE>
<TE>   In the works now is the self-starring science-fiction movie
"Christmas on Mars," which they hope to release next year. There's
also the soundtrack for a documentary called "Okie Noodling," about a
group of oddball fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Working on various projects at once allows the band a better
perspective on the individual undertakings, Coyne says. "The problem
with intense artists is they become obsessed with their own ideas.
You build [a song] up in your mind to be the most important thing in
the world, when it's just a dumb ol' song. You can't get any
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "So what I like to do is fall in love with the new thing. That
lets me be objective. I can hear [the tunes] without feeling like,
'Oh, my babies! Don't touch them.' "</TE>
<TE>   Perspective also comes as time passes, and "Yoshimi," due out July
16, plays like the more peaceful aftermath of "Bulletin," which found
Coyne dealing with his father's death in 1997, among other trials.</TE>
<TE>   The vignettes on the new album are characteristically imaginative,
offbeat, and psychedelic. But behind the freaky facade of trippy
electronica- and noise-infused tunes about robots that mimic human
emotions, a man who meets his future self and the terrifying
realities of astrophysics lie Coyne's sincere sentiments on what we
learn from death, what it means to be loved, and how wonderfully
precarious existence is.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden death from a heart ailment of an Osaka fan the Lips had
befriended on tour in Japan had a profound impact on Coyne and his
writing. "I had gotten to where I felt I could handle this sort of
stuff," he says, "so I started to wonder, 'Am I just gonna become a
cynical, seen-it-all old guy?' These songs are me saying, 'Maybe I
haven't seen the darkest days, but I've seen an ordinary darkness
that everybody can expect.'</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of being like, 'Gosh we're all gonna die. What are we
gonna do?' I speak in this voice of excitement, like I am now, and
say, 'Yeah, we're gonna die, but we're alive right now.' We can
either wait to die, or we can just live until we die. And there's a
big difference."</TE>
<TE>   Coyne says that his more direct lyrics are not so much a
departure, as many critics noted with "Bulletin," but rather a
fulfillment of early ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We always wanted to be able to do songs that would be on the
level of these grand pop songs that you always think about, like
Roberta Flack's 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' " Coyne says.
"If this was back in the day of those type of pop records, no one
would ever listen to me because I can't sing."</TE>
<TE>   Coyne's vocal heroes tended more toward Henry Rollins, John Lydon
and the Butthole Surfers' Gibby Haynes--"people who can't sing.
People who get up there and wreck [stuff]," says the man who himself
has presided over more than a few onstage fires and other performance
mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   "But I always wanted to be able to express things like a Roberta
Flack or a Dusty Springfield or Carly Simon," he says. "That's what
I'm reaching for, but I'm stuck in the body of a Gibby Haynes."</TE>
<TE>   He credits his bandmates and co-producers Dave Fridmann and Scott
Booker with creating settings that put him, and the group, in the
best possible light.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found a way to appear musical and epic," he says, "even
though, sitting here in my house, you'd say, 'You guys can't really
do that.' And I'd say, 'No, we can't, really. We're creating a
moment.' That's what art does; it gives you a moment."</TE>

<DH>Michael Maltzan's route to success is as carefully thought
out as his high-profile commissions</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Stand right here," Michael Maltzan says, steering a reporter to the
back of a garbage-strewn subway car rattling along the elevated
tracks above Queens, "and lean closer to the window." Maltzan is
directing the writer's first view of his recently completed design
for the Museum of Modern Art's temporary home in a rundown
manufacturing district miles from Manhattan. Right on cue, a series
of block letters on the building's roof slide into focus, forming the
letters M-O-M-A before breaking apart into a series of disconnected
forms as the train pulls to a stop. Maltzan looks pleased.</LD>
<LD>   And why not? Few architectural careers have been as carefully
choreographed as Maltzan's. Since completing a seven-year stint at
the office of the Los Angeles-based Frank O. Gehry, the pensive,
soft-spoken architect has become the darling of the art world, a man
whose client list includes Hollywood heavyweights and major art
institutions. Among his most recent commissions are a design for the
new Kidspace Museum in Pasadena, a renovation of the Hammer Museum in
Westwood, a house in Beverly Hills for onetime Hollywood power broker
Michael Ovitz and a major expansion of the Sonoma County Museum in
Santa Rosa.</LD>
<TE>   None of these projects, however, carries the expectations of MoMA
QNS. The museum's stature as one of the world's most venerable art
institutions will mean that its opening, scheduled for Saturday, will
draw international attention, and, many predict, will launch Maltzan
to architectural stardom.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this surprising is Maltzan's relatively young age. In
America, even the most talented architects are unlikely to land such
a juicy cultural commission until they are deep into middle age. By
comparison, the 42-year-old Maltzan is still a pre-prepubescent--an
age when most of his peers are still designing restaurant interiors
or scraping together enough money to build their first house.</TE>
<TE>   Such a meteoric rise has brought with it a high degree of
scrutiny. To his critics, Maltzan's career is a model of how to
achieve success without risk. They wonder if he is a precocious
talent, one of the rising voices of his generation, or simply a
smooth operator whose people-pleasing skills outweigh his
architectural accomplishments so far.</TE>
<TE>   As his former mentor Gehry puts it: "Michael has the potential to
be a great architect. But I wonder if his bedside manner is
developing too fast and if his talent can keep up."</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan was born in suburban Long Island in 1959. It was a
landscape of identical tract houses, a place that seemed to sum up
the promise of the postwar American dream. But like others of his
generation, Maltzan was acutely aware of the psychological cracks
concealed by the veneer of progress.</TE>
<TE>   The family struggled to support five children, and eventually
began drifting from town to town as Maltzan's father, William, a
medical supply salesman, searched for better-paying jobs. The elder
Maltzan tried selling furniture, then real estate and eventually
ended up as a welfare fraud investigator for the state of
Connecticut, while his wife, Jacqueline, stayed home to raise the
children. Maltzan withdrew into a malaise of boredom.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael was really a loner," says his younger sister Patricia
Matthews. "He'd sit in his room and watch a lot of TV. He really
didn't want to be bothered with the fluff of teenage life."</TE>
<TE>   Architecture became a way of grappling with--and
understanding--the world on his own terms. A self-proclaimed
third-rate student, Maltzan enrolled in his first drafting course in
high school in Hebron, Conn. The class was more about vocational
training than high design, but it offered a unique sense of
empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an order to drafting," Maltzan says. "You had complete
control over that piece of paper. And that may have been when I got
my first sense that you could actually control your environment."</TE>
<TE>   The continual moving as a child also helped him hone another skill
that would serve him well in later life: "I developed this ability
for navigating the social side of things quite quickly. Either you
sat in the corner or you found something to offer."</TE>
<TE>   "Michael's parents were very social in a '50s sort of way," says
his wife, Amy Murphy, who is also an architect. "Lots of parties and
cookouts. And his dad had all of the angst and all of the charisma.
So Michael's people skills were incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Maltzan found his way to the Rhode Island School of
Design, which in the early 1980s was pulsating with young talents who
were struggling to come to terms with a profession that seemed in
disarray. The public backlash caused by the big, brutal urban
experiments of the 1960s and '70s made it a bad time to be a
card-carrying Modernist. Postmodernism--a mix of neoclassical
references and ironic posturing--seemed like a descent into cynicism.
Professors and students were looking for more hopeful, pragmatic
models.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the school of design that Maltzan was exposed to his
first architectural idols, such as the Portuguese Alvaro Siza, the
Spaniard Jose Rafael Moneo, and the Boston-based Argentine team of
Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti. What distinguished these
designers from their American contemporaries was their ability to
create modern forms without repudiating the past. Moneo, for example,
was at that time working on his National Museum of Roman Art in
Merida, Spain, in which he rested the museum's brooding brick form
directly on top of existing Roman ruins. Machado and Silvetti's works
were slightly more precious--historical abstractions cloaked in
luxurious surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Siza's approach that struck a nerve with Maltzan. In
Siza's hands, the clean white spaces of classical Modernism were
twisted and bent, as if reconfigured by the forces of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, we always talked about this [Ludwig] Wittgenstein
quote, 'What's torn is torn'--that you accept the reality, the world
is a fractured place," recalls Murphy, who met Maltzan at Rhode
Island School of Design. "Michael was always interested in the
connection between things more than in the individual parts--the glue
that holds things together. So Siza was a big influence."</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan also found inspiration in artists like Richard Serra,
whose "Tilted Arc," a massive, curved, steel-plate sculpture set in a
public plaza in downtown Manhattan, was then causing a public outcry.
" 'Tilted Arc' meant a lot to me," Maltzan says. "It seemed to be a
more critical position than what some of the architects were taking,
and with minimal means. It represented a way out of the morass of
Postmodernism."</TE>
<TE>   From Rhode Island, Maltzan went on to Harvard's Graduate School of
Design, and in 1988, he and Murphy married. The couple soon began
casting around for a way to escape the provincialism of Boston and,
more important, an East Coast recession that was in full swing. L.A.
seemed the ideal destination--a city with a reputation as a thriving
architectural laboratory, brimming with opportunities for ambitious
young talents.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived flat broke--to pay for a meal at McDonald's, Murphy
remembers counting out the change in the ashtray of their Ford
pickup--and crashed at the West Hollywood apartment of a friend who
was working as an architect by day and playing in a punk rock band by
night. Still, for Maltzan, it was a return of sorts, a chance to
explore the suburban landscape of his childhood.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Gehry had just entered the 1987 competition for the
Walt Disney Concert Hall, and his office was suddenly booming.
Maltzan was hired to work on the competition. When Gehry's plan was
selected, Maltzan stayed on to see the project through to the
completion of the design.</TE>
<TE>   "When we won the competition, it was a shock. The next day Frank
walked through the office and congratulated everyone. At the end, he
turned to me and said, 'If all the seats fit, you did an OK job.' It
put me in my place. I realized that it was his moment of ascension,
and it was going to be a one-person elevator."</TE>
<TE>   Weary of the pitfalls that can ensnare young architects who cling
too closely to their role models, Maltzan began quietly mapping out a
blueprint for his escape. He determined that to be successful, he
would have to establish his own practice by age 35; get his work
published in the kind of glossy magazines that would get him noticed;
and steer clear of residential commissions that could pigeonhole him.
Having studied Gehry's rise, he saw the art world as a point of entry
to big-scale, public commissions.</TE>
<TE>   But escaping the long shadow of Gehry meant more than setting up
shop on his own. It meant finding his own voice as an architect, a
much more daunting task. His first solo project, the small, nonprofit
Inner City Arts complex for children, completed in 1995 in downtown's
decrepit warehouse district, included a bulging, tower-like ceramics
studio that echoed Gehry's earlier sculptural compositions.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan's next project, the Feldman/Horn Center for the Arts at
the exclusive Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood, harked back
to earlier influences, in particular Siza and the Viennese Minimalist
Adolf Loos. A delicate composition of line and form, the various
studio and gallery buildings wrap around a central court that is
punctuated at one end by a sculpted stair tower.</TE>
<TE>   What both projects reveal is a young talent closely studying the
methods of earlier masters. It is an almost classical view of an
architectural education--the equivalent of a 19th century Beaux Arts
student traveling to Rome to study classical temples. The work also
signaled an architect with a remarkably developed eye, someone whose
ability to compose space and form was mature beyond his years.</TE>
<TE>   As Maltzan struggled to hone a more personal vision, meanwhile,
his career began to soar. His relationship with Gehry remained
intense but distant--they traveled in similar circles but now tended
to avoid each other.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Stuart Regen, a local art dealer with connections to a
number of wealthy collectors, introduced Maltzan to entertainment
lawyer Alan Hergott. Hergott was impressed by the young architect's
maturity, and he offered him his first major residential commission:
a $2-million house in Beverly Hills on a site overlooking Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan's design broke no new ground. Its sleek, abstract surfaces
cloaked an interior that was more elegant than earth-shattering. But
the project opened a door into the kind of cultural salons that could
earn him high-profile commissions. Maltzan became a regular at the
Hergott home. Hergott and his partner, Curt Shepard introduced the
architect to local magnates like Ovitz and David Geffen, as well as
cultural power brokers like Museum of Modern Art architecture curator
Terry Riley, its director, Glenn Lowry, and Hammer director Ann
Philbin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Philbin selected Maltzan to design a major renovation of
the UCLA Hammer Museum in Westwood. That same year, Riley included
Maltzan in the "Un-private House" show at MoMA. By then, Maltzan was
at work on the redesign of the Kidspace Children's Museum, which is
scheduled to break ground this fall. And on Thursday, the Sonoma
County Museum selected him to design its $30-million facility in
Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   To some, Maltzan's ascent would not have gone so smoothly if the
work had been more challenging--and less conservative. They compare
him to other emerging talents of his generation--Neil Denari, Wes
Jones and the team of Kevin Daly and Chris Genik, to name a
few--whose explorations of new computer technologies have produced a
more flamboyant and distinctive design aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Maltzan is a perfect fit for the art world," says Sylvia Lavin,
director of the UCLA school of architecture. "It is a world that
doesn't want to seem bourgeois and middle class, but really wants to
play it safe. Maltzan's work satisfies that desire. Whether it's
actually provocative or opening up any new territory, I'm not
actually convinced by that."</TE>
<TE>   To others, however, Maltzan was beginning to articulate a language
whose subtlety was sometimes lost in a culture of visual overload,
where the temptation is often to ratchet up the "wow" quotient to
attain a modicum of recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that has changed in the last 10 years is that
the terrain got so crowded," says Bruce Mau, a graphic designer who
has collaborated with many celebrated architects, including Maltzan.
"Michael's architecture is very broad. It's about collaboration,
context. The work is quite subtle; at times it almost disappears. And
I think this is his way to find a clear tone within this cacophony."</TE>
<TE>   For Maltzan, each new commission is an opportunity to stretch his
architectural muscles. On a recent day in his office, for example,
strewn across various tables are a number of crude, unfinished
models, among them his design for the Kidspace Museum. The model
depicts the long, sinuous form of a building, its walls peeling apart
or coming together at various points to adapt to the surrounding
context.</TE>
<TE>   The delicate layering of the forms gives the model a rich
psychological texture, and hints at a new direction in his work. It
is an architecture of subliminal messages, which is composed of an
almost cinematic sequence of images. One expects that Maltzan will
expand on these ideas, especially as he begins to explore issues of
material and surface more fully.</TE>
<TE>   But if Kidspace is proof that Maltzan's work is still evolving,
MoMA QNS resonates with deeper symbolic meanings. Nearly 20 years
ago, Gehry created a temporary museum building in Los Angeles--the
Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo.
That project was considered a breakthrough--a raw, informal warehouse
space that served as a battering ram against the wall that once
separated high art from the harsh realities of everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   Maltzan's version lacks Gehry's raw, aggressive edge. Instead, it
suggests a more elusive, fragmented architectural narrative. The
blocky rooftop letters of MoMA QNS are an ephemeral pop image--an
expression of the project's lack of permanence.  Inside, a compact
sequence of stairs and ramps weaves back and forth through the space
before depositing visitors inside the galleries, a gesture that seems
measured to draw visitors farther away from the gritty world outside
and into a vault-like sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between the two designs, along with the irony of
Maltzan, a Gehry protege, designing a similar space for MoMA, was not
lost on Riley. But the museum official also sensed another reason the
commission might tap into Maltzan's particular sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting about this place is that it is where the
dense, high-rise city runs right into suburban sprawl, the junction
between East Coast urban tradition and the kind of landscape
epitomized by L.A. It seemed a perfect notion for someone born into
one condition and who matured in the other."</TE>
<TE>   The design's elaborate entry sequence suggests other metaphors as
well--a bridge, for example, between the shaky suburban ground of his
youth and the world of high art culture in which Maltzan has since
immersed himself.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its meaning, MoMA QNS has placed Maltzan in the
spotlight. To survive it, he will have to find a way to navigate that
increased scrutiny while maintaining the psychological space that
would allow him to further articulate his personal vision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the same as with an artist," the Hammer's Philbin
says. "I think it is really perilous when they get so much attention
so young, because they can crash and burn. It happens a lot in the
art world. But I also think you can tell when someone has the
maturity to handle that pressure, and I think that Michael does."</TE>
<TE>   The question, however, may be what kind of architect Maltzan wants
to become. Although Gehry is the architect with whom Maltzan is most
often compared, other career paths would be far more attainable. No
American since Frank Lloyd Wright, after all, has revolutionized the
language of architecture as profoundly as Gehry, and few living
architects have tapped into the public imagination with such force.</TE>
<TE>   A more likely scenario, by comparison, would be the career of
Frank Israel, who was a major star of Los Angeles' architectural
scene until his death from AIDS in 1996. Israel's designs--mostly
houses, often for Hollywood clients--took the fragmented forms
invented by Gehry and gave them a hedonistic twist. They were less
revolutionary than evocative of a certain time and place--elegant
creations that captured L.A.'s ephemeral nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I think success can be dangerous," Gehry says. "You have to find
a language that is personal and has its own integrity. So far,
there's a politeness to Michael's work that seems to take the edge
off of it. But only he knows if he's pulling punches."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there are few things as mysterious as the birth of a great
talent. Under the circumstances, only a fool would write Maltzan off
so soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only 42," Maltzan points out with a slight testiness. "Give
me a chance."</TE>

<LD>Mariah Carey released her "Glitter" album last year on Sept. 11. How
much that day's terrorist attacks can be blamed for the album's
ultimate poor showing is up for debate, but it's a good bet Carey
won't be releasing a new album in the week of Sept. 11 this year.</LD>
<LD>   Nor will just about any major recording act.</LD>
<LD>   In deference to what is certain to be a national and international
focus on commemorating the anniversary of the tragedies, the pop
music world is largely steering clear of scheduling major-act
releases not only for that week, but the weeks before and after as
well.</LD>
<TE>   This is no small matter for the beleaguered music business. Labor
Day weekend traditionally marks the start of the pre-Christmas season
in which many superstar albums are released with great promotional
fanfare. Last year, not only was Carey's album in stores on Sept. 11,
but so were new albums by Jay-Z, Bob Dylan, Nickelback, P.O.D. and
the soundtrack to the movie "Training Day" (all of which had strong
sales).</TE>
<TE>   While release schedules are still fluid at this time, a new Kenny
G album is the only top-rank release tentatively planned for Sept.
10, a Tuesday, the day of the week U.S. albums generally arrive in
stores, while rapper Xzibit and country star LeAnn Rimes are the only
high-profile ones currently scheduled for Sept. 17. Even very few
lower-profile releases are set for those dates. Many records that had
been there have been moved, including ones from the Foo Fighters (now
set for Sept. 24), Toni Braxton (Oct. 8) and Third Eye Blind
(sometime in October)--although the changes are being attributed to
such factors as recording delays rather than proximity to the
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Although this means losing two key weeks of the season, Bob Bell,
new-release buyer for the Wherehouse stores chain, says it's right
for both emotional and business reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard to get people excited about a pop record on a
date that has that much significance," he says. "And the media is
going to be very much dominated by Sept. 11 at that point."</TE>
<TE>   That means that regardless of the appropriateness of promoting pop
product at that time, it would simply be hard to get the message
through to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to tastefully bow out of the spotlight around that
date," says Joy Freuer, Capitol Records vice president of sales. "We
were scheduling Coldplay and OK Go and Shivaree and said, 'OK, we
need to avoid the 9/10 street date.' ... It came up spontaneously in
a sales meeting, but we looked at each other and said, 'Wow.' And
[distributor] EMI was completely understanding."</TE>
<TE>   Sensitivity to the dates is also apparent on other pop fronts. The
MTV Video Music Awards, usually held in early September, have been
moved to Aug. 29 (at New York's Radio City Music Hall), with Sept. 11
concerns being the stated reason for the change. Concert promoters
are also taking the anniversary into account. Brian Murphy, chief
operating officer of Clear Channel Concerts, says that regional
promoters in his company as well as artists' managers have expressed
concern about booking dates, especially in major cities, in the week
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Five or six [promoters] have gotten on the phone and said, 'Does
anyone think it's a good idea to do anything on Sept. 11 other than
stay at home?' " Murphy says. "And at the [KROQ] Weenie Roast last
week, there were two managers who told me that their artists are
coming back in September, but said they'd not only like to avoid
Sept. 11, but avoid the days before and after. All of our focus will
be another place in the days around Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   HIDDEN SHADOW: For the first video in connection with his new
album, "The Private Press," DJ Shadow has turned to Asia. The clip
for the track "6 Days" was made in Hong Kong by Shanghai-born
filmmaker Wong Kar-wai (who made 2000's acclaimed "In the Mood for
Love") and features actor Chang Chen, co-star of "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon." Shadow, who does not appear in the video, gave
complete creative control to Wong, who turned in a piece said to
feature sex and violence as well as stunning cinematography by
Christopher Doyle, who also works with Gus Van Sant and Barry
Levinson. Shadow's manager, Richard Brown, says that getting the team
to do the video was a coup. Wong had never done a music video, but
Brown and Shadow made contact through a mutual associate.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out [Wong] already knew and liked Shadow's music and
was coincidentally in the middle of shooting his new film, '2046,' "
Brown says. "He sent us an outline of an idea and told us who he
wanted to cast, and three weeks later we were in Hong Kong shooting
with him and his whole team. He works in a unique way--no script, no
treatment. It's all in his head and he invents it as he goes along.
Nobody, including the actors, knows anything until they are about to
shoot the scene. But he is so charismatic and enigmatic that you have
complete confidence in him."</TE>
<TE>   The completed video is expected to be delivered this week.</TE>
<TE>   WHO KNEW? Only the most devoted Who fans may know that there has
never been a true stereo version of "My Generation" or any other song
on the band's first album. They were originally released in mono and
then later in a "mock" stereo mix. That will change on Aug. 20 with
the release of a deluxe edition of the collection, made from the
three-track master tapes, which had been in the possession of their
producer, Shel Talmy.</TE>
<TE>   "We owned the music, he had the tapes," says Andy McKaie, senior
vice president of A&amp;R for Universal Music Enterprises. "For years
there was discussion back and forth. We worked out a deal and I went
into the studio with him."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did they create a true stereo mix, but they also
discovered a previously unreleased song, "Instant Party Mixture," as
well as some overdub parts not used on the original album. Adding
B-sides, alternate takes, mono versions of "My Generation" and "Legal
Matter," an instrumental of "My Generation" and a version of "Anytime
You Want Me" featuring only Roger Daltrey's vocals, the pair created
a 24-song, two-CD edition.</TE>
<TE>   The original was released in the U.S. as "The Who Sings My
Generation," but this will use the U.K. title, "My Generation."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Fiona Apple, who hasn't released new music since her
1999 album with the 90-word title generally abbreviated as "When the
Pawn ... ," is working on new songs, with plans to begin recording an
album soon. Jon Brion, a musician and arranger on her 1996 debut
"Tidal" and producer of the last album, will again be producing. No
release date has been set.... Boston band American Hi-Fi is wrapping
up "Beautiful Disaster," the follow-up to last year's debut. The
album is tentatively due in late October, with the band set to appear
on the Warped Tour in the summer.... With singer Josey Scott fronting
the ad-hoc supergroup on "Hero" from the "Spider-Man" soundtrack, his
group Saliva is in the studio working on its third album with
producer Bob Marlette. Titled "Back Into Your System," it's due Sept.

<LD>   "Nellyville"</LD>
<TE>   Universal</TE>
<TE>   Here's another rap album (due in stores Tuesday) that mines the
familiar theme of surviving celebrity. But the follow-up to Nelly's
debut, "Country Grammar," which has sold more than 7 million, proves
that the urban class-leap story line doesn't have to be hackneyed.</TE>
<TE>   Channeling the R&amp;B spirit of his hometown, the St. Louis rapper
presents himself as "the Bill Clinton of tha Lou." Nelly sings more
than he did on "Country Grammar," and he uses blues to illuminate
boasts about his tightknit crew, malleable women and, of course,
jealous competitors. It could easily become tedious, but the beats
always love the rapper's trickling flow, and they are the album's
dominant force--the Shaq of team Nelly.</TE>
<TE>   That means his Kobe is the St. Lunatics, his MC compadres, each of
whom is a conventionally "better" rapper than the album's
wispy-voiced centerpiece. Their work allows Nelly to shift from Ja
Rule-like singing-rapping to Nate Doggy country-ness.</TE>
<TE>   Southern-inflected and bubbling fresh, the songs generate enough
goodwill that even Nelly's collaboration with 'N Sync's Justin
Timberlake works, even if it sounds calibrated in a boardroom rather
than conceived in the studio. "Hot in Here" and "Pimp Juice" ride
Nelly's Show-Me State humor to erase the line between risque and
hard-core.</TE>

<TE>   SONIC YOUTH</TE>
<TE>   "Murray Street"</TE>
<TE>   Geffen</TE>
<TE>   The members of Sonic Youth have always worked like poets, senses
flared to the emotional current of their New York City, and faith in
this process has now led them to one of their most human albums and
possibly their best. "Murray Street," their 16th full-length album in
21 years, is a mature statement that satisfies as completely as their
last three messy experiments--"Washing Machine," "Experimental Jet
Set" and "NYC Ghosts and Flowers"-- did not.</TE>
<TE>   Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore opens the lead track, "The
Empty Page," with startling confidence: Here is a myth-making
combination of signature sound and accessible melodies brought into
fine focus. Evoking the Byrds, the Velvets, even Quicksilver
Messenger Service, the still-experimental but unforced songs contain
not a wasted note, even when, as on "Rain on Tin," or "Karen
Revisited," songs slide into trademark shards of guitar decay and
shriek-back.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Murray Street, the location of Sonic Youth's recording
studio, is only two blocks from ground zero, and that the Sept. 11
attacks came in the middle of writing the album, it's easy to
attribute the emotional focus to disaster. But it probably has more
to do with the stabilizing kinetics of avant-rock guitarist and
post-classical composer Jim O'Rourke, who now joins Moore, guitarist
Lee Ranaldo, bassist Kim Gordon and drummer Steve Shelley as the
band's fifth member.</TE>
<TE>   Where the old Sonic Youth shows through in pure noise lust, as on
"Sympathy for the Strawberry," there is a new heartbeat holding it
all together, a sort of Eno touch, a grounding promise of resolution.
It's a return to the form that made "Daydream Nation" a landmark of
the post-punk era, but with a new respect for the fragility of not
only a music scene that has fallen into confusion, but, of New York
itself.</TE>
<TE>   As Moore sings on "Radical Adults Lick Godhead Style":</TE>
<TE>   I'm dead by the beauty of strangers</TE>
<TE>   and how my head transforms them into</TE>
<TE>   smiling beatific roommates</TE>
<TE>   from dust to dust, they create rock 'n' roll.</TE>

<TE>   RALPH STANLEY</TE>
<TE>   "Ralph Stanley"</TE>
<TE>   DMZ/Columbia</TE>
<TE>   You think Eminem is scary? Check out "Little Mathie Grove" on the
new album by mountain music pioneer Ralph Stanley. This traditional
folk tune about infidelity and revenge is as grisly as anything for
which the Detroit rapper has taken it on the chin from his critics.</TE>
<TE>   Coming from the 75-year-old patriarch of Appalachian folk music,
it won't get one one-hundredth the attention Eminem generates, but on
an emotional level it resonates even more powerfully because there's
no whiff of imaginative artistic invention behind it. Backed by a
Burnett-led string band, Stanley sings it in a voice as old as dirt
and every bit as primal, piercing straight to the darkest recesses of
the human soul.</TE>
<TE>   This collaboration between Stanley and T Bone Burnett, a
producer-arranger with an abiding respect for the eternal power of
that music, yields musical empathy and expression of the first order.
There are no fillers, no novelty numbers, nothing but music born of
the most fundamental human experiences: love, loss and heartache.
Fleeting moments of joy stem from the belief that happiness comes
only with spiritual salvation. Stanley will be on the Down from the
Mountain Tour at the Greek Theatre on Aug. 1.</TE>

<TE>   PAPA ROACH</TE>
<TE>   "Lovehatetragedy"</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether rap-rock will lose its luster, like
disco in the '70s and new wave in the '80s, but now that bands who
hit it big melding fierce word flows and noisy riffs are starting to
abandon the heavy hybrid, things don't look too promising.</TE>
<TE>   Papa Roach burst onto rock radio in 2000 with the groove-filled
"Last Resort," a near-perfect amalgam of aggressive textures and
punchy vocal bites made even stronger by a soaring, catchy chorus and
themes of frustration and misery. The second single, "Broken Home,"
was more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   On the Northern California band's second album, the singer has
changed not only his name--from Coby Dick back to his given Jacoby
Shaddix--but also his propensity for hip-hop. From the very beginning
of "Lovehatetragedy," it's evident that P-Roach, as fans call the
band, is more concerned with being punky than funky. The album
opener, "M-80," is an all-out thrasher that sets up what follows:
grinding guitars, blistering beats and sorrowful singing.</TE>
<TE>   In general, it's a more melodic record. Cuts including "Time and
Time Again" and "She Loves Me Not" are as sinuous as they are
emotional. The problem is that there really aren't any "Last
Resort"-level standouts here. With or without rap breaks, these new
tunes, however heartfelt, lack the contagious energy and undeniable
hooks of Roach's earlier material.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sheer power and passion might appeal to a pop-punk
contingent. Although the band has played on both tours,
"Lovehatetragedy" puts the band more in Warped territory than Ozzfest
land.  Lina Lecaro</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Avril Lavigne, "Let Go," Arista. Girl-rock meets boy-rock
in this polished debut from a 17-year-old Canadian waif with
attitude. Call her Alanis: the Next Generation. Lavigne and various
producers blend sensitive folk-pop, melodic punk-metal and aggressive
rap-rock to fuel glossy-gritty personal vignettes, which can be
appealing but are at times repetitive and bland. Still, her
declarations of individuality, tales of doomed romance and agony over
being ignored ring true, and will doubtless strike a chord with her
peers--and perhaps others. "I'd rather be anything but ordinary,
please," she avows. Oh, honey, wouldn't we all?</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ** New Found Glory, "Sticks and Stones," MCA. How many hopped-up
pop-punk records can the market bear? This quintet of Gen-Y brats
trudges through crunchy power chords as if they actually meant
something, and sing in high, perky harmonies that bring to mind,
well, any number of like-minded popcore bands. This is the musical
equivalent of kids' breakfast cereal--too much sugar and not enough
nutrition.</TE>

<HD>A Piano Piece's Nuts and Bolts</HD>
<DH>For James Tenney, learning to play a John Cage work as it
was intended was a long, strange trip that included one to the
hardware store</DH>

<LD>On a spring evening in 1951, a budding 16-year-old pianist with an
interest in engineering went to hear John Cage play one of his most
famous pieces, the "Sonatas and Interludes" for prepared piano, at
the Women's Club Auditorium in Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "The concert blew me away," James Tenney says, seated at a
prepared piano in his studio at CalArts, as he demonstrates the
exquisite clinks, plinks and thuds that Cage produced by wedging
bolts or bits of rubber or plastic between the strings of the piano.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, that concert helped propel Tenney, one of America's most
important experimental composers, into a career that has included
pioneering work in computer music and collaborations with Cage.
Tenney is also a formidable pianist. But for half a century, the one
work that started it all, although neither technically nor
technologically difficult, eluded him.</LD>
<TE>   In April, almost exactly 51 years from the date he attended Cage's
recital, Tenney finally played the "Sonatas and Interludes" at
CalArts, and Friday he will repeat it at the Schindler House in West
Hollywood. It's part of a two-evening exploration of Cage's early
work, marking the 90th anniversary of Cage's birth and the 10th of
his death, both of which are this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Sonatas and Interludes" consists of 16 sonatas in simple forms
reminiscent of the Baroque keyboard works of Domenico Scarlatti, with
four freer interludes, and it lasts around 70 minutes. The first
performance of the complete set was by Maro Ajemian at Carnegie
Recital Hall (now the Weill Recital Hall) in New York in 1949. It was
not controversial. In the New York Times review the next day, Ross
Parmenter described the evening as a grand occasion with noted
painters, writers and musicians in the audience, including actor
Burgess Meredith and ballerina Vera Zorina. The critic concluded, "It
left one with the feeling that Mr. Cage is one of the country's
finest composers and that his invention has now been vindicated
musically."</TE>
<TE>   The musical establishment and the New York Times would soon change
their tune about Cage, as he changed his. Just around the corner was
his enthusiastic decision to compose using chance operations, to
embrace the idea of indeterminacy in music (sometimes using graphic
notation that allows the players complete freedom in the choice of
pitches and rhythms) and to become besotted with silence. The piece,
"4'33," " during which no music is performed, had its premiere 3 1/2
years after "Sonatas and Interludes." Cage would continue to write an
enormous amount of music up to his death in 1992, some of it grander,
more ambitious, more impressive and more groundbreaking than "Sonatas
and Interludes," and all of it less conventional.</TE>
<TE>   But if "Sonatas and Interludes" stands as Cage's one conventional
masterpiece, it is nevertheless an underground masterpiece. There
have been about 25 recordings of it, yet most are by modern music
specialists on small independent or obscure labels. Hearing a
prepared piano live is still a rare and exotic adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Tenney says that despite having given notable performances of
Ives' monstrously difficult "Concord" Sonata and working with
advanced technology, the prepared piano long intimidated him. That is
what prevented him from playing "Sonatas and Interludes" all those
years. "You know, you've got to go through something very unfamiliar
before you can get down to hearing the piece," he says. "And it
commandeers the piano, you can't play anything else on it. So you've
got to have a piano that you can devote to this for as long as it
takes to learn it."</TE>
<TE>   As a musician and theorist with a busy career--composer, teacher,
founder of the Tone Roads ensemble in New York in the 1960s, member
of the original Philip Glass and Steve Reich ensembles--Tenney has
had other things to do. But last fall, when Tenney, who now teaches
composition at CalArts, decided to use the academic year to produce a
student Cage festival, he decided that it was also time for him to
face the prepared piano.</TE>
<TE>   With the score to "Sonatas and Interludes," Cage provides a table
of preparations. Forty-five of the piano's 88 notes are altered, and
Cage lists the types of hardware to be used and indicates in inches
where they are to be placed along the two or three strings that
create most piano notes. In a 1949 interview, Cage said that
preparing the piano accomplishes four things: It quiets the note,
changes its timbre, splits it into two or three sounds, and shortens
its duration. He then emphasized that the change must be complete.
Otherwise, "like a well-known person appearing in costume, there's
something clownish about it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet clownish dangers lurk in Cage's table of preparations. The
materials--small, medium and large screws, rubber, eraser,
plastic--are hardly precise. And the measurements will vary from
piano to piano. Cage does not specify the size or model of the
instrument. What to do?</TE>
<TE>   "I first studied the chart," Tenney explains. "I counted how many
screws, I counted how many medium bolts, how many large bolts, etc.
Then I went to the hardware store, bought some hardware, brought it
back and started trying to use it. I went back to the store several
times when I found that screws wouldn't stay in, because the diameter
wasn't large enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually I got the feeling that a certain bolt is OK, but the
sound would be more interesting if it were a heavier one."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Tenney decided that where, say, Cage indicated a
screw, a 1-inch or three-quarter-inch bolt worked best. Cage
distinguishes between furniture bolts and large bolts, but Tenney
believes that they were the same thing, that it was the larger weight
that was wanted. As for the eraser: "John specified American Pencil
Co. eraser No. 346, but of course I never could find that, so I went
to Staples and got what looked like the kind of eraser that I
remembered as a kid. And that's what gives you this wonderful sound
down in the bass. I did a lot of experimenting."</TE>
<TE>   Late in life, Cage said that he thought the original piano on
which he made his measurements was a Steinway "O," a 5-foot-10 grand
popular in the 1940s, but Cage's memory was not always reliable.
Tenney's ear tells him that the measurements work best based on the
dimensions of a 7-foot instrument. His ear and the demands of the
music have become the ultimate arbiter.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, he points to the seven-note chord that begins the
piece. It is repeated twice in the first measure. Six of the notes
are razor-sharp staccato attacks, but a D above middle C, according
to the score, must be sustained through two beats.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is," Tenney says, playing the chord over and over,
"the pitch is so dampened by a piece of plastic that you can barely
hear anything afterwards." His solution for the plastic strip was to
use the smallest piece he could cut from his Vons card. It proved
just the thing to keep that D ringing a little longer. After the
demonstration, I went home and listened to that opening chord on 18
recordings. None was as successful as Tenney in getting the effect
Cage asks for.</TE>
<TE>   Tenney had had any number of opportunities to talk to Cage about
how to go about the preparations. In the 1960s, he performed Cage's
music often and got to know the composer well. For a performance of
"Atlas Eclipticalis" that Leonard Bernstein presented with the New
York Philharmonic, Cage invited Tenney to help him with the live
electronic mixing of the amplified orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   But Tenney explains that his reason for never bringing up the
"Sonatas and Interludes" went back to his first meeting with
composer. Too shy to go up and introduce himself to Cage at the
Denver performance, Tenney finally met Cage a few years later in New
York. In 1954, Tenney enrolled as a piano student at the Juilliard
School, where his roommate was experimental filmmaker Stan Brackhage.
"It was Stan who got in touch with Cage," Tenney says, "because he
had made a film using a recording of some of the 'Sonatas and
Interludes' as music for it. He wanted Cage's permission, so he
called him up and arranged a meeting, and I tagged along.</TE>
<TE>   "It was at a bar, and Cage bought us a beer. The meeting was very
quick, maybe only 10 minutes. I got the sense that he was very busy.
And you know what he said about the permission? He said, 'I'm not
interested in that music anymore, you can do what you want with it.'
So I never brought it up with him."</TE>
<TE>   When Tenney first played "Sonatas and Interludes" on April 12 in
the intimate Roy O. Disney Concert Hall at CalArts, the performance
was a revelation. Partly that was due to Tenney's careful
preparations, which gave the sound a kind of three-dimensional aspect
that made it fresher and more alive than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The prepared piano has often been compared with a one-man gamelan,
an Indonesian orchestra of colorfully metallic gongs and bells. It is
still a piano, because nearly half of the pitches remain unchanged,
but others lose specific pitch as they are transformed into
percussion sounds. A quick scale up and down the keyboard is
peculiar--here a pitch, there a plink. For once, tinkling the
keyboard really means something.</TE>
<TE>   But the enchanted sound of Tenney's performance was also the
result of many other decisions that must go into performing "Sonatas
and Interludes." The pieces do not require a world-class technique,
but they are rhythmically subtle, and call for clarity, grace and
luminous transparency.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the work's premiere, Cage explained that the
individual pieces were meant to express the "permanent emotions" of
the Hindu tradition: "the heroic, the erotic, the wondrous, the
mirthful, sorrow, fear, anger and the odious, and their common
tendency towards tranquillity."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one-to-one correlations between the music and the emotions
are not obvious. A few years earlier, Cage had poured his heart out
in a short suite for prepared piano, "The Perilous Night," which was
intended to express "the loneliness and terror that comes to one when
love becomes unhappy." But when a critic described the last movement
as "a woodpecker in a church belfry," he concluded that something was
very wrong with the whole notion of trying to express feelings
through music.</TE>
<TE>   Tenney says he finds it ironic that in the later, essentially
abstract series of pieces, Cage would talk about specific emotions.
"My sense is that many of the pieces throughout the 'Sonatas and
Interludes' are very tranquil, and that maybe those nine emotions are
something distributed more or less broadly throughout the whole set."</TE>
<TE>   In Tenney's playing, the emotions are fleeting; they come of the
moment and disappear just as quickly. But this happens to be a
byproduct of a mathematical analysis of the score's intricate
rhythmic structure. Cage's curiously irregular phrase lengths led
Tenney to produce equally curious articulations, taking breaths, or
breaks, in untraditional places.</TE>
<TE>   Tenney also has a theory about why Cage would tie himself to
something so mundane as the simple Baroque sonata form. He sees the
influence of Schoenberg, with whom Cage studied for two years.
"Schoenberg's emphasis was on comprehensibility," Tenney says, "and I
think Cage was very concerned to put these new sounds in a formal
structure that would be very easy to grasp on first hearing."</TE>
<TE>   That comprehensibility in early works, Tenney found, was readily
apparent to his CalArts students. There are indeterminate works that
can still be a big challenge, and some of the late pieces are almost
impossibly virtuosic.</TE>
<TE>   "But with the earlier work, it was duck soup," he contends. "There
really is no problem, and I didn't even need to coach some of the
students."</TE>
<TE>   Older musicians, though, sometimes have to overcome their
instincts. Tenney found he had to remind faculty violinist Mark
Menzies (who will perform Cage's Satie-esque Nocturne with Tenney
this weekend) to play without vibrato to achieve the unmodulated
sound Cage was after.</TE>
<TE>   There could be a different sort of problem in bringing these
sounds, especially the magical ones of the prepared piano, to the
Schindler House.</TE>
<TE>   There are historical reasons for using the venue to perform Cage.
He stayed for nine days late in 1932 in one of the apartments that
German emigre architect Rudolf Schindler rented out to young artists.
Later, Cage and composer Henry Cowell produced a few concerts in the
garden. But that was before the kind of ambient noise that now is
pervasive in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Tenney's solution will be to perform "4'33" " before "Sonatas and
Interludes." "I really want to get into listening to the sounds that
otherwise might be thought of as interference and absorb them so that
we become part of that sound environment," he explains. (Playing it
will also commemorate a third Cage anniversary this summer: "4'33" "
had its premiere 50 year ago in Woodstock, N.Y.)</TE>
<TE>   But Tenney probably needn't worry too much. A well-prepared piano,
well played, has a way of getting through to a listener whatever the
acoustic restraints. In 1947, Maro Ajemian, for whom "Sonatas and
Interludes" was written, recorded the prepared piano solos from
Cage's "Amores." One evening that summer, folk legend Woody Guthrie
wrote a fan letter to the Disc Co. of America, as he listened to the
scratchy 78 rpm disc. "I need something like this oddstriking music,"
he began in the postscript, "to match the things I feel in my soul
tonight." (The singer also wrote that that morning, his wife,
Marjorie, had "given birth to a big 7-pound boy" --Arlo.)</TE>
<TE>   "So let me say my thanks one more time to you, Maro," he
concluded, "for recording up and down for me all of this virgin
unsettled and wild wide open sounding dancy music there on the keys
of your big piano."</TE>

<LD>"I have become Vishnu, destroyer of worlds."</LD>
<LD>   --J. Robert Oppenheimer in</LD>
<LD>   "The Day After Trinity"</LD>
<TE>   If, as Dr. Johnson said, the knowledge of one's imminent death
concentrates the mind wonderfully, a nuclear explosion in a film
ought to make everything else irrelevant, ought to clear away the
cobwebs of mere entertainment and force us to think the unthinkable,
to contemplate the possibility of our own demise and what we can do
about it.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's the theory. The reality, however, is rather
different. The moviegoing audience, like the public in general, has
apparently shown a remarkable resilience, an ability to shrug off
bigger and bigger shocks, and make believe they are messages intended
for some other species on some other planet. The threat of world
extinction isn't called "the unthinkable" for nothing, and not
thinking about it is understandably most people's posture of choice.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent, and in some ways, the most disturbing nuclear
blast ever put on film is the rogue bomb detonated under a Baltimore
football stadium by terrorists in "The Sum of All Fears," the Phil
Alden Robinson-directed version of Tom Clancy's 1991 novel that
opened a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   To better understand what's different about it, what this film
accomplished and what that may mean, a look at some cinematic nuclear
landmarks is a good place to start.</TE>
<TE>   The ground zero, so to speak, of all atomic films is "The Day
After Trinity," Jon Else's devastating 1980 documentary about
Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project and the creation of the world's
first nuclear device at Los Alamos. Using chilling bomb test footage
and extensive interviews with those who were there and did the deed,
Else's film captures both the euphoria of youthful scientists who
thought they were saving the world and the horror that replaced those
good feelings after the first test weapon was dropped at New Mexico's
Trinity site and the first hostile bomb all but vaporized Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   Here were thoughtful, sensitive, cultured men and women who
suddenly couldn't avoid the agonizing realization that without
thinking it through, they might have taken the first steps in the
world's ultimate destruction.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a more dramatic, more pivotal moment in 20th century
history, it's hard to think of it.</TE>
<TE>   The movie business was quick to exploit the dramatic potential of
this powerful new weapon, even if people perhaps didn't realize at
first quite how powerful it was. As early as 1945 and 1946, according
to the American Film Institute catalog, fast-moving B-picture makers
made now-forgotten films like "Danger Woman," "Shadow of Terror" and
"First Yank Into Tokyo" that used the A-bomb as a plot device.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the first film to capture, as much metaphorically as
actually, the bone-chilling horror of a nuclear explosion was 1955's
completely unlikely "Kiss Me Deadly," directed by Robert Aldrich and
very loosely adapted from the Mickey Spillane novel. Starring Ralph
Meeker as hard-boiled detective Mike Hammer, "Kiss Me Deadly"
involved the search for something he called "the Great Whatsit," a
small suitcase that, opened so much as a crack, emitted an eerie,
otherworldly glow.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's a nuclear device, and, in one of the great moments in
American film paranoia, it does detonate. Although the notion of an
atomic bomb that goes off when a suitcase opens all the way may not
have been the most accurate science, few films captured so well the
sense of strange, helpless terror about thermonuclear weapons the
nation was starting to feel.</TE>
<TE>   Just about a decade later, in 1964, one studio, Columbia Pictures,
brought out two very different films that focused on the bomb going
off, the lionized "Dr. Strangelove" and the rarely revived
"Fail-Safe."</TE>
<TE>   Archly subtitled "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb," "Dr. Strangelove's" brilliant black-humor approach to the
apocalypse, complete with Slim Pickens' Major T.J. "King" Kong riding
the bomb like a bucking bronco, turned annihilation and a closing
newsreel shot of the blast's mushroom cloud into a sophisticated
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "Fail-Safe," which was shown this year at Cannes as part of a
sidebar program on restored films, is quite a different animal. It's
a bleak, thoughtful, quietly terrifying film about the choices an
American president (the irreplaceable Henry Fonda) has to make when a
mechanical glitch mistakenly sends U.S. bombers on a mission to nuke
Moscow and can't be called back.</TE>
<TE>   With Walter Matthau especially mesmerizing as an unapologetic
hawk, it features the kind of examination of serious issues that has
become harder and harder to find from Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   What "Fail-Safe" doesn't have, for dramatic as well as
state-of-the-art reasons, is a realistic picture of what happens when
a nuclear device goes off. (The film indicates its atomic catastrophe
with a series of still photographs of Manhattan, ending on a chilling
freeze frame.) In interviews, "Sum of All Fears" director Robinson
says he initially didn't want to show the blast either. "My first
instinct when I first read it," he told In Focus magazine, "was 'Ooh,
do we have to have the bomb go off?' "</TE>
<TE>   But what Robinson came to realize was that special effects
technology has so improved from "Fail-Safe's" day that it is now
possible to show a nuclear blast with a degree of realism, including
"the shock wave hitting things miles away," that was never before
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Which is one of the reasons the explosion in "The Sum of All
Fears" is so unnerving. While earlier films simply used stock footage
of real tests, or came up with pale simulations, this film shows us a
blast--complete with an ugly mushroom cloud, bewildered casualties
and a concussive force that wreaks havoc--that feels shockingly
plausible, a nightmare come to all-too-believable life.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor at work here is the way current events have
overtaken the film's scenario. No, we haven't had an explosion quite
like this one, but after Sept. 11 that possibility can't be
confidently relegated to the world of speculative fiction. We watch
this too-close-for-comfort blast with a sinking sensation,
considering the possibility that what we are witnessing is not
entertainment but a Nostradamus-type prophecy of what our future
might bring.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ben Affleck, the film's star, "The Sum of All Fears"
is intended to agitate: "As a cautionary tale, the idea is to make it
disturbing, to raise awareness about nuclear proliferation."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, however, it's not clear that audiences are taking
it that way. For one thing, moviegoers made "Sum" the No. 1
attraction in America its first two weekends, something that doesn't
usually happen to cautionary tales.</TE>
<TE>   For another, no one worth quoting seems to be taking things all
that seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's favorite cinematic son, John Waters, told
Entertainment Weekly, "I have no problem blowing up Baltimore in a
movie if it's done with joy and style." The city's mayor was quoted
in the Baltimore Sun as saying, "I think Baltimoreans are always kind
of thrilled to see their city make the big screen, even if we are
getting nuked."</TE>
<TE>   But beyond this bravado, maybe something serious is going on.
Maybe people are flocking to "Sum" because they are fearful of a
devastated future, because they want to look at what might happen to
reassure themselves that they can handle it, to measure themselves
against the apocalypse and see if they feel strong enough to survive.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, just maybe, in a world where newspapers are running
front-page stories about the horrific possibilities of an
India-Pakistan nuclear war that could instantly kill as many as 12
million, people are going to see "The Sum of All Fears" because they
want to have a sense of what is at stake in a world where nuclear
arms show no sign of going away.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's because they realize that, as one expert in nuclear
crisis analysis told USA Today, the average person "doesn't have a
clue what this would mean" and they desperately want to get that
clue.</TE>
<TE>   They perhaps want to see something that would educate them in a
relatively painless way, that might encourage them to care about the
politics of nuclear proliferation and an arms race that never seems
to lack for convenient enemies.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, we can always hope that at least some of this is
true. It's not what today's audiences are used to taking from films,
nor what films are used to providing, but at this moment in time it's
not too much to say that the future of the world may depend on it
being so.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Exorcise a GOP Demon</HD>
<DH>Simon ad woos Latinos alienated by Republicans' past
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Frank del Olmo is the associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a state as big and diverse as California, one broadcast ad will
not make or break a political campaign. Still, the ad Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. began running last week is
both noteworthy and praiseworthy.</LD>
<LD>   It is noteworthy because it was the first ad that Simon's campaign
broadcast in an uphill effort to unseat Gov. Gray Davis. The
better-funded Davis campaign has been hammering away at Simon with
its own TV ads for weeks now.</LD>
<LD>   Even more intriguing, however, is the language that Simon's
campaign team opted to use in its first ad--Spanish.</LD>
<TE>   The new Simon ad will be used on both radio and TV stations to
"introduce" the GOP candidate to a group of voters he has made only a
minimal effort to woo thus far, California's more than 400,000 newly
enfranchised Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   It is also noteworthy that a California Republican would make such
a dramatic, and potentially controversial, gesture to seek Latino
voters' support.</TE>
<TE>   After all, most political analysts trace the GOP's current weak
position in California to 1994, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican, linked his reelection campaign to Proposition 187, the
ballot initiative to bar illegal immigrants from schools and other
publicly funded services.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 187 passed but was nullified by the courts as
unconstitutional. And Wilson got reelected, but his victory proved
pyrrhic.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Mexican tone of the campaign for Proposition 187 so
frightened immigrant Latinos that thousands of them rushed to become
citizens. And once those new citizens started voting, they took
vengeance on Republicans who tried to follow in Wilson's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   A key reason the GOP is now a weak minority in Sacramento is that
it got only 23% of the fast-growing Latino vote in the 1998 and 2000
elections, according to the Times Poll.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Simon's ad would be praiseworthy simply for the courage it
must have taken the candidate and his advisors to tread onto
political terrain that many California Republicans still believe is
unfriendly, if not downright dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even more important is the topic and tone of the Simon ad.</TE>
<TE>   It focuses on Latino children in the state's schools and accuses
Davis--who pledged to be an "education governor" in his 1998
campaign--of failing to improve public education. The criticism is
debatable, to be sure, but the importance of education as an issue
that matters to Latinos is not.</TE>
<TE>   The ad also portrays smiling Latino students in a hopeful light,
and ends with Simon intoning, in stiff but correct Spanish, that
California's future is "nuestros hijos, suyos y mios," ("our
children, yours and mine").</TE>
<TE>   What a refreshing contrast to a GOP ad I sadly remember from 1996,
when Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was so desperate to challenge
then-President Clinton in California that Dole took a page from
Wilson's book and approved an ad that tried to tap into the
anti-immigrant themes of Proposition 187. It featured the notably
unsmiling faces of Latino youngsters and literally referred to them,
in the dark words of its faceless narrator, as a danger to
California.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon's Spanish-language ad serves no other purpose than to put
hateful campaign commercials like Dole's on the shelf forever, the
Simon campaign will have done a great service to California.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Simon's ad may do more than that. It could finally begin to
heal the chasm Wilson and his ilk created between the GOP and the
many Latino voters--I estimate between 30% and 40%, based on the vote
for popular GOP candidates like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon--who
lean toward the Republican philosophy for personal or cultural
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   If these potential Latino Republicans get inspired, they just
might help bring some partisan balance back into California politics.</TE>

<HD>Letting Women Athletes Soar</HD>
<DH>Title IX doesn't hurt men's sports: It levels playing
fields and courts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE</AU>
<BD>Jackie Joyner-Kersee, in addition to having represented
the United States in four Olympic Games, holds the world record in
the long jump and the heptathlon.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you walk around a college campus today, you'll see many things
that weren't there 30 years ago, including many more women engaged in
competitive sports and enjoying the benefits of athletic
scholarships. Much of the credit for this dramatic change goes to
Title IX, the 1972 law that prohibits sex discrimination in all
aspects of federally funded education programs, including athletics.</LD>
<LD>   Title IX, passed 30 years ago today, created the opportunities
that led to key accomplishments of my life. My dream to attend
college was made a reality with a Title IX basketball scholarship to
UCLA. This provided the momentum and opportunity to represent the
United States in four Olympics, bringing home six Olympic medals.</LD>
<LD>   So much has changed for women and girls since I was a kid. At age
9, I remember being excluded from facilities and training rooms
because they were for boys only. My coach even had to make a
long-jump pit in his backyard because I couldn't use the boys' field.</LD>
<TE>   This pattern continued in junior high and high school, where, as a
female athlete, I was relegated to after-hours practices and
underfunded programs.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time I reached college, Title IX was being enforced to
give me--and millions of young women like me--the opportunity to
develop my fullest potential. With the guidance of my role models and
support of my family, I rose from those beginnings in East St. Louis,
Ill., to the Olympics in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   I am just one of many who have benefited from Title IX. Since
Title IX, the number of female college athletes has increased from
fewer than 32,000 to more than 150,000 today. Like me, many of these
women would not have made it to college without the scholarships that
Title IX provided.</TE>
<TE>   We have seen changes at the high school level too. These girls are
not only developing their athletic abilities; girls who play sports
enjoy greater self-esteem as well as better health, body image and
academic accomplishment. Participation in athletics also decreases
the likelihood of drug use, sexual activity and unplanned pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   But Title IX's role in athletics is far from complete. Too many
young women and girls are still in danger of never realizing their
true potential. Stereotypes about women and girls being uninterested
in sports persist.</TE>
<TE>   All those stereotypes I heard didn't stop me from going the
distance; growing up in a family of athletes, I knew girls could
practice with as much strength and dedication as the boys.
Unfortunately, many girls never receive such encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   At the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Boys &amp; Girls Club of East St. Louis,
we give girls this kind of encouragement--and it gives boys the
opportunity to see that girls' participation in sports takes nothing
away from them.</TE>
<TE>   Critics claim that Title IX produces reverse discrimination,
eliminating men's athletic teams for the sake of meeting "quotas."
This is simply untrue; nothing in the law says schools must set aside
a mandatory number of slots for women or show certain numbers to
prove equal opportunity. In fact, schools can comply with Title IX
simply by demonstrating expanded opportunities for female athletes or
by showing that the interests of female students are indeed being met
at the school.</TE>
<TE>   As I was growing up, my mother told me to be strong like a rose
that has grown through the cracks in the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   As this important civil rights law turns 30, it is my hope that
young women and girls across the country have the chance to follow
these words of encouragement and continue to break new ground for
themselves.</TE>

<HD>Administration Should Till Middle East's Middle Ground</HD>
<DH>Radicals' efforts to sabotage peace can be undercut by U.S.
resolve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAOUD KUTTAB</AU>
<BD>Daoud Kuttab is a Palestinian journalist and the
director of the Institute of Modern Media at Al Quds University in
Ramallah.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was no coincidence that the latest spate of attacks against
Israelis occurred as President Bush was about to make his policy
statement regarding the Middle East. Among other things, the
statement was expected to include a road map to solving this
century-old conflict on the basis of an independent Palestine
alongside a safe Israel within secure borders.</LD>
<LD>   It was also no coincidence that the attacks by militant Islamic
Palestinians occurred despite a plea by leading Palestinian
intellectuals for an end to attacks against Israeli civilians. I
signed the public statement drafted by the top Palestinian official
in Jerusalem, professor Sari Nusseibeh, in the hope that we can show
Israelis there is real opposition among Palestinians to these
senseless killings.</LD>
<LD>   The timing of the recent attacks against Israeli civilians seems
to be aimed at thwarting U.S. attempts at peacemaking and to weaken
Palestinian moderation.</LD>
<TE>   While Israelis and Palestinians are suffering, those behind these
attacks are benefiting from the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon also benefits from this
vicious cycle of violence. Israeli collective punishment,
apartheid-like travel restrictions, daily tank incursions and
assassinations of Palestinian leaders contribute to the sense of
desperation and hopelessness that has produced these attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The continuation of building illegal Jewish settlements in
Palestinian areas simply adds fuel to an already raging fire.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Palestinian and Israeli moderates, who reflect the
majority, should work together against the radicals. This has not
happened because the hard-line Sharon government uses the attacks
against Israelis as an excuse for making no effort on the political
front.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, however, is very active on the military front. The harsh
Israeli actions deepen the cycle of violence, killings and, most
important, hatred between our peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Terror and violence against civilians on both sides must stop. It
is inexcusable not to immediately negotiate an end to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The late Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin used to say, "We will fight
terror as if there is no negotiations, and negotiate as if there is
no terror."</TE>
<TE>   A genuine peace leader would adopt a simultaneous political and
security policy for the sake of his own people and that of regional
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has refused to talk politics, and Yasser Arafat has been
unable to stop the militants. With Palestinians and Israelis unable
to do what is needed, the role of the U.S. becomes that much more
important.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. can't simply declare the vision of peace; it must do all
it can to implement it, including publicly criticizing any party
obstructing the way to a fair agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross has told me that what he
regrets most is that he and the Clinton administration covered up too
many transgressions on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of an overall settlement, he told me, the
Americans overlooked the wrongs committed by Palestinians and
Israelis. In retrospect, he said, the U.S. should have publicly
exposed any side that failed to carry out commitments it made.</TE>
<TE>   Such active U.S. involvement is needed now more than ever.
Israelis and Palestinians are exhausted. We are unable to move out of
the boxes we have trapped ourselves in.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., with its historical support for people's freedom and
human rights, its strategic power and its special relations with
Israel, can accomplish what no other nation in the world can.</TE>
<TE>   What the Bush administration must do is lay out a fair deal, draw
up a reasonable road map and timetable and work tirelessly on the
ground until it is implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Washington must know that radicals on both sides--within and
outside the leadership of both peoples--will try to derail such a
process. This should not deflect the Americans from pursuing their
ultimate goal. If radicals see any hesitation, they will increase
their destructive efforts. American resolve must be based on
Washington saying what it means and meaning what it says.</TE>
<TE>   The insanity of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has to stop, even
if foreign forces must be flown in for this purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and Israelis yearn for peace. The Middle East wants
it, and the world demands it.</TE>

<AU>JOSEPH S. NYE JR.</AU>
<BD>Joseph S. Nye Jr. is dean of Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government and author of "The Paradox of American Power: Why the
World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone" (Oxford University Press,
2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Sept. 11, just hours after the terrorist attacks on the United
States, spontaneous expressions of solidarity with America broke out
all over Europe. Marches, church services and candlelight vigils from
London to Rome demonstrated an amazing unity between our two
continents. Yet nine months later, those feelings have starkly
changed. Old friends, longtime supporters of the United States, are
openly critical of us.</LD>
<LD>   According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, the
majority of people in France, Germany and Italy think their
partnership with the U.S. should not be as close as it has been.</LD>
<LD>   Even the British are divided on the issue, with younger people
leaning toward a more independent course. Their reaction is linked to
a general feeling that President Bush has ignored allied interests in
conducting the anti-terrorism war and in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, Europeans and Americans have sniped at and admired each
other for more than two centuries. But many of the policy differences
today are significant. The list includes the Kyoto Protocol on
climate change, the International Criminal Court, trade issues and
the Middle East--Iraq, Iran and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   At a deeper level, the alliance is challenged by a changed world.
Terrorism and the threat of instability in the Balkans do not provide
the same glue that the Soviet Union did. The United States now trades
more with Asia (though direct investment remains higher in Europe).
And culturally, younger generations across the Atlantic have
different views on issues such as capital punishment and genetically
modified foods. Perhaps most interesting, many Europeans project
their regional experience onto the global stage. They profess a
greater devotion to multilateral approaches, even when using their
numbers to vote as a bloc against the United States in international
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Some Americans are returning the rhetorical volley, referring to
Europe as an "axis of petulance" and professing disdain for
"Euro-wimps." As Europe falls behind the U.S. in its expenditures on
high-tech weaponry, some analysts see it becoming irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Such American overreactions are shortsighted. Europe is the
closest thing to an equal that the United States has. The economy of
the European Union is roughly equal to that of the U.S.; its
population is considerably larger, as is its share of world exports.
Europe spends about two-thirds of what the United States does on
defense, and includes two countries that possess nuclear arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   Disdain for Europe is typical of those who measure American power
primarily in military terms. But power in today's world is more like
a three-dimensional chess game.</TE>
<TE>   On the top military board, the world is indeed unipolar, with no
country able to challenge the U.S. But on the middle economic board,
the world is multipolar and the United States cannot achieve its
objectives in areas including trade and financial stability without
the cooperation of Europe, Japan and others. On the bottom board of
transnational relations that cross borders outside the control of
governments (including everything from bankers to terrorists), it
makes no sense to talk of American hegemony. The U.S. cannot cope
with these issues alone. We need help from Europe and others.</TE>
<TE>   Our military may have defeated the weak Taliban government in
Afghanistan, but it destroyed only a fraction of Al Qaeda, which has
cells in 50 countries. Wrapping them up will take close cooperation
in intelligence, policing and tracing financial flows.</TE>
<TE>   Even militarily, our allies bolstered the political legitimacy of
our position in Afghanistan and helped with special operations on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the United States could decide to take on Saddam
Hussein unilaterally, but the political and military costs will be
lower if we include others. While the Pew poll shows European
disapproval of a unilateral American attack on Iraq, majorities in
Britain, Germany and France say evidence that Hussein is developing
nuclear weapons would be a very important reason to take action
against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The frictions that accompany U.S. unilateralism are more likely to
lead to drifting apart than to a sharp divorce that would produce a
hostile challenger, but the loss would nevertheless be great. Not
only will Europeans conspire more often to frustrate American
political objectives, but the United States will lose its best
partner for promoting democracy and human rights.</TE>

<HD>The Gardener's Appendix</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the young seamstress with a high-risk pregnancy and no medical
benefits, the gardener from Guatemala with acute appendicitis and the
middle-aged woman whose heart condition puts insurance premiums out
of reach, county-run hospitals and clinics are a lifeline. For the
attorney whose Jaguar collided head-on with a sport utility vehicle,
a county-run trauma center is a lifesaver.</LD>
<LD>   Unless drastic change happens soon, however, many of Los Angeles
County's poor and uninsured residents will lose their doctor of last
resort. Fifty percent of the region's heart attack, stroke and trauma
victims--rich and poor alike--who would receive lifesaving treatment
in county trauma centers might find doors closed. Beginning next
year, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services faces a
deficit that by 2005 will reach $800 million, one-fifth of its
budget.</LD>
<LD>   The best hope for the chronically ailing department is a plan that
recently hired health chief Thomas Garthwaite will present to the
county Board of Supervisors this week.</LD>
<TE>   The first medical doctor to head the department, Garthwaite is
suggesting changes that would make sense even without a looming
deficit. Some have to do with internal politics and bureaucracies,
such as getting rid of the various fiefdoms that keep one arm of the
department from knowing what the other is doing. (Good luck.) Others
aim to deliver care more efficiently by using computers to track
patients and better manage chronic diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite's plan also calls for consolidations, closings and
layoffs, painful cuts that would cost some employees their jobs and
force poor people, many of them without cars, to travel farther for
care. The supervisors will hear understandable howls of pain. (They
may howl themselves about the cuts in their districts.) But unless
the county comes up with a bold plan to make the department more
efficient, the federal and state governments won't help out--as they
must if more severe cuts are to be avoided. What the county
desperately needs from them is not so much additional money, unlikely
in any case, but more flexibility on where and how to spend it.</TE>
<TE>   More people without medical insurance live in the Los Angeles area
than anywhere else in the country, most of them working at low-paying
jobs that don't provide benefits. A UCLA study released last week
found the number of uninsured statewide to be lower than previously
thought because more have enrolled in Medi-Cal and the Healthy
Families program. The bad news is that the state budget deficit will
result in fewer people in these government-paid programs.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite has taken a cogent, systemwide look at how to deliver
the best care allowed by limited resources. And in a county
government that shrouds its decision-making, he presented the plan in
public meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors, accustomed to competing for clinics and hospitals
in their districts, must give his plan a chance. They, like the
Guatemalan gardener, have no alternatives.</TE>

<LD>   Some seem downright silly. Why does California need an official
state tartan or fife and drum band? And some seem duplicative.
California has an official state rock (serpentine), mineral (native
gold) and gemstone (benitoite). There is an official state fossil
(saber-toothed cat) and a state prehistoric artifact (chipped stone
bear); an official state dance (West Coast swing) and folk dance
(square dance).</LD>
<LD>   The official state marine fish is the garibaldi, described as a
sort of ocean goldfish, rather than a salmon or golden trout.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe City) wants California to
have an official ghost town. AB 1757 would add Section 429.7 to the
Government Code, saying, "Bodie is the official state ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   Bodie, to be sure, is one of the splendid ghost towns of not just
California but the entire West. Bodie long has been a popular state
park off U.S. 395 north of Mono Lake and Yosemite National Park. The
idea came from students of Lee Vining Junior High School who thought
the designation would boost tourist travel to the area. A noble
sentiment, surely, but not a persuasive reason for perpetuating the
silliness of ever more official state things.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Bodie's claim is being challenged by another
candidate for official ghost town, Calico, near Barstow in San
Bernardino County. A proposed amendment would have designated each
town "an official ghost town," but neither would be the official
ghost town. Leslie argued that the selection of Bodie would
"demonstrate the state's rich Gold Rush history." But wait. That
means California should have an official Gold Rush history site. And
that would have to be Coloma, where John Marshall started it all by
finding gold in the American River in 1848.</TE>
<TE>   But Leslie and Bodie have prevailed. AB 1757 is expected to breeze
through the Senate this week and soon will be on its way to Gov. Gray
Davis for his signature. Davis could put a stop to this frivolity by
vetoing the bill. But it's an election year, and, every voter being
important--including the parents of those Lee Vining
youngsters--that's not likely.</TE>
<TE>   But now, come to think of it, California doesn't have an official
state fungus yet. Or an official state mountain, an official state
roadside rest stop or....</TE>

<LD>One day many years ago in a valley not far away, Geoff Marcy's
parents gave him a used 4-inch telescope. At night he would unlatch
his bedroom screen and climb onto the patio roof with his new toy.
There, for countless hours, the boy toured the solar system and Milky
Way. Marcy recalls feeling very small but strangely connected to
something much larger and grander as he studied Saturn's rings,
monitored the movements of Jupiter's moons and wondered whether
anyone or anything was out there looking back at Granada Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Marcy grew up and defected to Northern California, to a planet
called Berkeley. He's taller now but still feels small as he scans
the skies with UC Berkeley computers, $5-million spectrometers and
telescopes with 33-foot mirrors. Marcy leads one of several global
teams quietly collecting intriguing evidence of earthlike planets
orbiting stars. While we obsess about really important things such as
budgets, secession and soccer and a few things of somewhat less
galactic import like songs and thongs, these isolated bands of men
and women spend their nights atop mountains imagining what might be
in places far away.</LD>
<TE>   Because their work does not involve blowing anything up, these
astronomers get little attention. Until the other day, when they
announced the discovery of a solar system, 55 Cancri, with planets
possibly positioned like ours. This could create the conditions for
evolutionary life "just" 41 light-years away.</TE>
<TE>   It took years to find the first such planet. Now, seven years
later, Marcy and others have plotted more than 90 planets orbiting
stars like our sun; most are like Goldilocks' porridge--too hot, too
cold or too hot and then too cold. Because the host stars are so
bright, Marcy doesn't actually see these planets; that awaits a new
generation of telescopes. He can, however, infer a planet's presence
by the minute wobble of its star, as the unseen planet's gravity tugs
during orbits. Big tugs equal big planets. Star movements appear as
shifting colors in a spectrum as starlight passes through telescopes.</TE>
<TE>   If you think your house is big or your commute long, here on this
summer solstice weekend are some numbers the 47-year-old Marcy
confronts daily: In 15 years, they've examined 1,200 nearby stars. In
our Milky Way, there are about 200 billion stars like our sun.
Probably half of those stars harbor orbiting planets. And there are
an estimated hundreds of billions of other galaxies like ours.
Today's rockets travel 20,000 miles an hour. But light travels
186,000 miles a second. Which means the telltale wobbling starlight
recently transiting Marcy's huge telescope left 55 Cancri right about
the time the young boy with the little telescope was peering up from
that patio roof in Granada Hills.</TE>

<HD>Ralphs Grocery Clears the Air</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The accusations regarding Ralphs Grocery Co. trucks in "Cleanup Time
for Ralphs" (editorial, June 13) are the same ones made by the
Natural Resources Defense Council and, after a full trial, found to
be without merit. The court held that Ralphs had fully complied with
the terms of the settlement.</LD>
<LD>   It has been, and continues to be, the policy of Ralphs Grocery to
study, test and implement environmentally safe and cost-effective
technologies, including the use of alternative fuels. This includes
spearheading efforts to get clean trucks on the road. Ralphs operates
one of the cleanest, most modern truck fleets in the nation. The U.S.
Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and
university researchers have all praised Ralphs for its leadership in
clean-fuels research.</LD>
<LD>   Of all the facilities scrutinized by the state in its examination
of grocery distribution facilities, Ralphs was found to be the least
polluting.</LD>
<TE>   Ralphs and other grocers made a deal with the NRDC to end its
lawsuit. Included in this agreement was a provision to try
natural-gas trucks--if government funding was provided and if the
trucks were cost-effective and reliable. Neither condition occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly available reports show that natural-gas trucks are a
failure. They are costly to operate, are not dependable and pose a
number of safety and health concerns. Grocery trucks are not like
buses or garbage trucks. They require much more power to haul heavier
loads. Natural gas does not have nearly the amount of energy offered
by other fuels and thus isn't suited for use with heavy loads.</TE>
<TE>   The NRDC went to court in an effort to rewrite the deal it made
with Ralphs. After a full trial, the court completely rejected its
arguments and found Ralphs to be in full compliance with the
settlement.</TE>

<LD>Re "Higher Valley Breakup Fee Is Estimated," June 19: "Leech Angeles"
now says it will need $288 million in annual "valimony" payments if
the Valley secedes in November--$160 million more per year than the
official Local Agency Formation Commission estimate. Furthermore, the
chairman of the consulting group that came up with this mind-boggling
figure says there would be no reason to decrease such payments after
20 years.</LD>
<LD>   I hope England doesn't get wind of this, or the Brits may ask
Americans to send them "compensation" checks to make up for 226 years
of lost tax revenue.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Hahn Passes (a Big) Hat," June 17: Mayor James Hahn's use of
the mayor's office to solicit anti-secession donations from
businesses is one of the most insidious uses of an elected office
imaginable. As serious problems remain unaddressed (e.g., rising
homicide rates), Hahn and his associates seem more focused on
coercing than on solving. And he wonders why secession is so widely
supported?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Valley secessionist leaders' outreach efforts to South Los
Angeles are disingenuous ("Breakup Pitched to South L.A.," June 16).
As a Van Nuys homeowner said, "Many white people seem to want to
maintain their wealth and power." The response by the secessionists
to this racism charge is that the demographics of the San Fernando
Valley are much more diverse. But this response is comparing apples
with oranges and does not answer the question of motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there is greater diversity in the San Fernando Valley, but
then why doesn't the secessionist leadership reflect this diversity?
Could the motive be that, since the balance of power at City Hall is
beginning to shift in a direction that better reflects the changing
demographics of Los Angeles, and perhaps the perception among the
secessionists is the loss of access, then by seceding from the city
the secession leaders may better ensure their role as the
gatekeepers?</TE>
<TE>   If the secession leaders' motives are truly altruistic, they may
want to reach out to "ethnic minorities" within the valley and stop
playing ethnic politics by catering to present community
dissatisfaction.</TE>

<LD>Re "Need for Speed Has Workers Seething," June 19: As long as we
maintain a for-profit economy, employers will be faced with the
relentless demands of competition. When profits ebb--which they
invariably do--economic survival forces owners to cut costs. It is
not a universal given, but rather an integral component of our
particular economic system, that sees workers defined as
commodities--something to be sped up or replaced by technology.</LD>
<LD>   The irony is that in many job sectors we have the capacity to cut
our workweeks by half while maintaining robust production levels and
the same pay. It is only the irrational logic of capitalism, with its
insatiable hunger for profit, that stands in the way of a better life
for the vast majority of people in this world.</LD>

<LD>Re "District's Bathroom Brouhaha," June 18: I believe it comes down
to priorities: classroom books for the students or $100,000 for
private bathrooms; smaller classrooms or $100,000 bathrooms; raises
for the teachers or $100,000 bathrooms; supplies for the schools or
$100,000 bathrooms; fine arts and sports in the schools or $100,000
bathrooms. Is it that difficult to decide what's right for the
children in the public schools?</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. school board members need a place to escape the throng of
questions thrown at them in the hallways--I'm so sorry they are so
inconvenienced. Tell it to the children and teachers who don't have
enough books to go around the class or even to take home to do their
homework. I'm sure they'll understand and agree that the seven new
bathrooms for $100,000 should get priority. What an insult!</LD>

<TE>   The decision to build private restrooms for school district
executives and board members further illustrates the dichotomy
between the LAUSD's administrative actions and its educational
priorities. Last year, when my daughter was enrolled at Dodson Middle
School, we learned that the school's formula for keeping "clean"
restrooms was to lock them and block students from having access to
them.</TE>
<TE>   We were repeatedly assured by local school administrators,
district officials and the superintendent himself that the school was
"in compliance" with district policies concerning students' access to
restroom facilities. As if the daily demands of school were not
stressful enough, a growing number of LAUSD students must also put up
with overcrowded campuses and a scarcity of restrooms.</TE>

this kind of aging, neglected infrastructure on the mental state of
all the stakeholders at this school and other schools like it.</TE>

<HD>Message of Watergate Is Going Unheeded</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Dean's eulogy-redux to Richard Nixon is almost as tragic as
Nixon's ignominious Watergate-forced departure from office
(Commentary, June 17). Dean alternately coos and sobs over Nixon
without ever conceding that Nixon couldn't have done it without
Dean's initial compliance.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps most tragic, in current politics, is White House
political advisor Karl Rove's troubling comment: "Is there something
specific we've drawn from Nixon? I'm not aware." He has apparently
learned nothing from history and may have doomed the rest of us to
repeat it.</LD>

<TE>   Now that the Watergate scandal has reached its 30th anniversary,
the big question is: Has it had any significant impact to positively
influence our political culture? Unfortunately, the answer is a
resounding "no."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has emphasized secrecy like no other
presidency since that of Nixon, almost to the point of obsession.
Freedoms and civil liberties have been sacrificed wholesale in order
to combat terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential papers are going to be withheld from the American
people for long periods, and national security-related historical
information is going to be that much more difficult to obtain. This
further denies our access to important information, which is
tantamount to censorship.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence agencies are growing in number, size and scope of
activities, literally turning into super agencies, further intruding
upon our civil liberties. Obviously, America has learned nothing from
Watergate. It seems that it is blindly heading down the same path
again.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How ironic it was that The Times ran a vintage Paul Conrad cartoon
of the Watergate era with Dean's article, in which a beleaguered
Nixon was depicted as Shakespeare's King Richard II. I remember
thinking when I saw it in 1973 that Nixon also looked like a very
weary King Lear.</TE>
<TE>   The irony today is that Nixon's two daughters are now battling for
the control and the direction of the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in
Yorba Linda, which is chillingly reminiscent of Lear and his own
daughters. So the cartoon has added poignancy nearly 30 years later.
Give me the good old days of Nixon and Conrad!</TE>

<HD>A Nuclear Waste Disposal Plan Shouldn't Be Rushed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON MacFARLANE</AU>
<BD>The author is co-director of the Yucca Mountain Project
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The earthquake that shook the Nevada desert this month wasn't much by
seismic standards, but with luck it rattled some nerves in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude-4.4 temblor's epicenter was a mere 12.5 miles
southeast of Yucca Mountain, the site where the Bush administration
proposes constructing a national nuclear waste repository. The
proposal has already been approved by the House of Representatives,
and a Senate vote is pending. As a geologist who has spent the last
six years studying the proposal, I hope that the earthquake has made
some senators rethink their votes.</LD>
<LD>   The state of Nevada is strongly opposed, as one might expect, to a
nuclear waste repository in its backyard. The other 49 states are
pleased that they weren't chosen for the facility. But a decision
that could affect environmental health for the next 10,000 years
deserves to be treated as more than just another NIMBY case.</LD>
<TE>   The government has a problem --more than 70,000 metric tons of
high-level radioactive waste. No one would dispute the need to secure
that material. The question is whether burying it in the Nevada
desert 90 miles from Las Vegas would meet standards set by the
Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that hazardous radiation
would not leak from the site for 10,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   Though research on Yucca Mountain has been going on for years, few
scientists outside government agencies have had a chance to review
this work, much of it in groundbreaking areas of earth science. The
Yucca Mountain Project was created by geologists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan in an effort
to ensure independent and unbiased scientific review of the planning
for the repository, but that has not been easy.</TE>
<TE>   The science itself is both fascinating and challenging. For
starters, it's difficult to project what the Earth will be like in
10,000 years--a short period in geological time, but a long one when
you are trying to predict relatively small changes in the Earth
system. Currently, the climate seems to be warming, which could mean
that in 100 years today's dry location might not be so dry.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the issue of whether it is better to store nuclear
waste above or below the water table. The U.S. is planning to bury
its waste above; every other industrialized nation is planning to
bury it below or in a salt formation. Sweden and Finland have made
their choices because spent nuclear fuel "rusts" when exposed to air
but not to water. In a dry location like Nevada, waste will
deteriorate more rapidly if the canisters in which it is buried
corrode, and the radioactivity would then have nothing to contain it.
The United States is betting on a new corrosion-resistant composite
out of which its canisters will be constructed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Energy's plan is to bury the waste in
tunnels constructed 1,000 feet below ground and 1,000 feet above the
water table. The waste will be placed in the canisters, and the
tunnels, after 100 to 300 years, will be permanently sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain was picked, in part, because it is an arid,
unpopulated area already owned by the federal government, which used
it as a nuclear test site from the 1950s to the early 1990s. The
original theory was that, if canisters deteriorated, there would be
little water in the dry ground to carry the radioactive waste to
other areas. But that theory has already been thrown into doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Chlorine-36, a radioactive isotope created during nuclear weapons
tests over the Pacific Ocean in the 1950s, has recently been found
1,000 feet below ground at Yucca Mountain. In just 50 years, that
material traveled in the atmosphere to Nevada, was delivered as rain
at Yucca Mountain and traveled at least 1,000 feet below the
surface--the level where the nuclear waste would be stored. Such
rapid movement was completely unexpected and required a revision of
models of water flow in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are only beginning to understand how water moves at
Yucca Mountain, but it is already clear that buried radioactive
material may travel more quickly than the Department of Energy (DOE)
expected. Earthquakes, like the one this month and another with a
magnitude of 5.6 in 1992, further complicate the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's reaction to the complex geology is to
focus more heavily on the canisters in which waste will be buried,
reasoning that the longer the canisters last, the longer it will take
for waste to be exposed to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plans to bury its waste in canisters made of Alloy 22--a
new composite metal containing nickel, chromium and molybdenum--and
then lined on the inside with stainless steel. Alloy 22 is resistant
to corrosion from water, but it is a man-made substance that has
existed for only about 20 years. The DOE has only about two years of
data on the effects of corrosion on it. Using such limited data, the
government is predicting the life expectancy of the canisters 10,000
years into the future.</TE>
<TE>   No other nation is planning to use Alloy 22 to bury its nuclear
waste, and the material does not exist in nature, so there is no way
of naturally predicting how strong it will prove to be. Clearly,
further study is needed before reliable predictions can be made.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report from the U.S. General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, urges the federal government to
postpone a decision on Yucca Mountain, saying that the studies
conducted to date are not adequate to assess site suitability.
Delaying until we have more answers is the best approach. Perhaps the
site will prove to be the best place to store waste for the next
10,000 years--or perhaps not. Ten years of further research will
provide the answers to some of the unresolved scientific questions
that will affect the safety of the repository. In the meantime, waste
can continue to be stored at the power reactors and weapons
manufacturing sites where it was generated. Even if transportation of
the waste began today, it would take many decades to consolidate all
of it at Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Research is steaming ahead on issues relating to nuclear waste.
Unfortunately, the scientific facts may arrive too late to influence
a political decision.</TE>

<HD>Gulf War Redux</HD>
<DH>The president seems determined to attack Iraq again. But
have we fully grasped the lessons of the last time around?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It is now crystal clear that the Bush administration intends to go to
war with Iraq. The armed forces have gone so far as to create a
top-secret code name for the planning. They call it "Polo Step," and
access is highly restricted and compartmentalized.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the determination to fight has not been matched by
a clear, creative, carefully thought-out approach to developing
strategy and tactics--an approach that would take into account the
full capabilities of the armed forces today and the real lessons of
Operation Desert Storm.</LD>
<LD>   Many members of the Bush national security team are veterans of
the first war with Iraq, among them Vice President Dick Cheney and
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Yet Pentagon planners have
received little guidance beyond hazy injunctions to bring about
"regime change" and eliminate Saddam Hussein's capacity to build
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a planning vacuum, filled by a cacophony of
competing proposals and "concepts" that reflect the biases of
individual services or the pipedreams of political factions: Launch
250,000 U.S. ground troops from Kuwait, some suggest; pound hundreds
of Iraqi targets with unrestricted air power, others urge; send in
the Special Forces to work their Afghanistan-style magic among the
Kurds; or, the favorite of right-wing hawks, unleash that phantom
resistance force known as the Iraqi National Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The compartmentalized secrecy classification only makes it harder
to get the planning process back onto solid ground. Wars cannot be
planned on the floors of Congress, or in other public places. But
locking out most of the Defense Department's own professionals
doesn't work well either. American military power is in the midst of
such a radical transition, and the challenge posed by Hussein is so
difficult, that President Bush needs the best minds available--all of
them--thinking as boldly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to start would be with "Engagement Area Thomas."
Probably no one in the Bush White House would recognize the name, and
few if any among the Defense Department's current civilian leadership
would either. But "EA Thomas," as the Army called it back in 1991,
offers today's war planners a lesson they sorely need right now.</TE>
<TE>   Every armchair general knows about the famous ''left hook'' of
Desert Storm, the nighttime sweep across the desert to the west of
Kuwait that carried U.S. tanks and other armored forces around the
unguarded left flank of Hussein's vaunted defensive line and routed
his legions.</TE>
<TE>   Less well known is the role of the 101st Airborne Division. The
Screaming Eagles were on the leading edge of the left hook with a
specialized assault force of more than 200 Apache and Cobra attack
helicopters. The then-new Apaches, in particular, carried the
Hellfire antitank missile, which would become famous in Afghanistan a
decade later when CIA drones launched them against elusive Al Qaeda
targets.</TE>
<TE>   The 101st was to use the firepower and mobility of its attack
helicopters and light infantry to slow any Iraqi onslaught until the
heavy armor of other divisions could reach the scene. As it happened,
after 39 days of bombing by U.S. and allied warplanes, Hussein's
forces were no longer in the onslaught business. Instead of fighting
a delaying action, the 101st leapfrogged 155 miles farther into
southern Iraq. There, it established massive refueling and rearming
points in the desert; they were supposed to support further attacks
into the ancient heart of Iraq--the Euphrates River valley, which lay
at the far northwestern edge of the American battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the first day of the ground war, Feb. 24, 1991, the
101st had flown more than 1,000 helicopter sorties. Before U.S. tanks
were anywhere near catching up to them, Screaming Eagle helicopters
were hovering over Iraq's Highway 8, the strategic southern route
between the Kuwaiti theater and Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the evening of day two, a desert shamal came howling
through the region, a blinding, choking dust storm that shut down
almost every element in the American advance. It didn't matter. Iraqi
forces in the Kuwait theater were beaten. Their only remaining option
was retreat.</TE>
<TE>   The only other possible routes to Baghdad were Highway 6 from
Basra far to the east along the Iranian border, or smaller roads
along a series of causeways and embankments through the vast
marshlands where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet. Lt. Gen. Gary
Luck, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, dispatched an additional
aviation brigade to the 101st Division force to close off that
option.</TE>
<TE>   Enter EA Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Apache helicopters from the 101st launched attacks into the
marshes. And commanders had decided to set up a "kill box" 120 miles
farther to the east on a stretch of Highway 6 they designated
"Engagement Area Thomas." Thomas was just 10 kilometers north of
Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. The division's plan was to airlift
its 1st Brigade of light infantry into Thomas, in a move its official
history says "would have firmly closed the door on the escaping Iraqi
army by blocking the north-south Basra road."</TE>
<TE>   The plan was extraordinarily bold. It meant airlifting hundreds of
American troops far beyond the existing battlefront and landing them
behind a retreating but still heavily armored enemy. But out of the
blue--or so it seemed to the Screaming Eagles--an overall cease-fire
was declared and the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   The rest, as they say, is history.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf famously declared the gate closed on
escaping Iraqi military units. In fact, the gate was not closed, and
much of the Republican Guards, Hussein's best-trained and
best-equipped units, escaped into the megalopolis of Basra as the war
ended.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the mistake that was made in leaving Hussein an escape route
then pales in comparison with the mistakes that have since been made
in interpreting what happened in the Gulf War, especially the little
corner of it named Engagement Area Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. troops landed there, but Apache helicopters flew daylight
missions into the area, along the critical escape route, for four
hours before the war ended, and they never encountered a single Iraqi
tank.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's was a slow moving and truly defeated army, and the
United States had the mobility and the audacity to perform complete
surprises, if creative thinkers who actually understood the geography
and the battle conditions had been allowed to use their creativity.
But Schwarzkopf, and by extension, Washington, did not see what air
power had already achieved in defeating Hussein's army.</TE>
<TE>   They were myopically wed to the doctrine that the only effective
way to wage a war is to overwhelm a theater of operations with ground
troops, effectively matching Iraqi tanks one for one. American
military leaders and their civilian superiors could not conceive that
southern Iraq could be split off from Baghdad through Army air
power--or that an audacious move by airborne troops could isolate an
entire Iraqi army, with all the negotiating leverage that would have
given the United States against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely the lesson of EA Thomas, however. New weapons
and equipment are opening the way to new strategies and new tactics,
but the technology is changing faster than the understanding and
vision of those who command it.</TE>
<TE>   If the Bush administration is to fight a second war with Hussein,
what it needs to do above all else is to break free of its obsession
with secrecy and bring its best military minds to bear on the problem
of devising strategies and tactics that take full advantage of the
revolutionary capabilities our armed forces now possess.</TE>
<TE>   The current Central Command proposal to launch 250,000 troops from
Kuwait in a Normandy-style invasion does not represent the kind of
audacious thinking the problem requires and our present capabilities
will support. Neither does the notion of pounding hundreds of targets
in an all-out air war. And the right-wing love affair with the
CIA-created Iraqi National Congress or with Kurdish fighters in the
north is foolishness.</TE>
<TE>   But a combination of all those approaches, coupling air-mobile
Army assault forces with strategic air power and covert operators
linked to proxy forces like those in Afghanistan, offers the best
hope of a positive outcome--not just on the battlefield but in
whatever comes afterward.</TE>
<TE>   So far, that is not happening. Polo Step briefings are filled with
arrows and symbols for bridges and other targets, with no sense of
taking real advantage of Iraqi geography, the ability to isolate
Basra or the fact that the Kurds already control a huge portion of
the north--including usable airfields (remember what airfields in
Pakistan and Uzbekistan meant for Afghanistan?).</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the Bush administration decides to do militarily,
Americans need to approach from three fronts--north, south and west.
That means Special Forces and helicopters. It means desert boots and
aircraft on Iraqi territory.</TE>
<TE>   Putting U.S. forces inside Iraq will convey the deadly serious
message that the United States is not going to walk away this time.
It will say the United States is not hoping to match Hussein tank for
tank. And it is not going to keep on trying to hit Hussein through
the Iraqi civilian population--the one form of warfare he can
probably survive indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the best plan for the United States is to say
exactly what it is going to do right up to the end, so that the Iraqi
people and the rest of the world understand.</TE>

<LD>Some people like their whales dead, for the tons of meat and oil that
they yield. Others like them alive. Those two views crashed head-on
last month at the annual meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC), which entertained a Japanese proposal to pave the
way toward legalizing commercial whaling, suspended since 1986. The
commission has voted repeatedly against resuming whaling, and most of
its longtime members showed no inclination to change that position.
But Japan attempted to play a new card this year, inducing poor,
nonwhaling countries (like Guinea and Gabon) to join the IWC and to
vote for the proposal in return for Japanese foreign aid.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome was a political disaster for Japan, which not only
lost the vote but so outraged even its allies that some of them
withdrew their support. Still, no one expects this latest battle to
settle the long-running whale wars. The commission plans to meet
again in October to set out terms by which any future commercial
whaling would be carried out. In November, the Japanese will try to
convince the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
that minke whales are now so abundant as to deserve less protection.
While these passionate debates are in the first instance about
whales, they also involve broader questions of how best to manage
internationally valuable biological resources, and how Japan as a
densely populated island nation will feed itself. All sides in the
dispute have their own agendas.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments against whaling are of two types: ethical and
economic.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us take a middle ground on treatment of animals: We object
more to killing dogs and chimps, say, than to killing bacteria and
worms. We justify such distinctions because of the animals' different
capacities for social relationships, intelligence and feeling pain.
Whales (along with primates) are closest to humans in these respects,
and so arouse strong feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Those who support a ban also make an economic argument based on
whales' position at the top of the ocean food chain. Both on land and
in the sea, the functioning of ecosystems depends disproportionately
on their top species: Knock out those controlling players and you're
likely to mess up the whole ecosystem. Paradoxically, reducing whale
numbers may end up reducing numbers of those fish species that humans
eat, as some whales may especially eat predatory fish preying on fish
eaten by humans. For a long time, Japan denied that whaling would
reduce whale numbers. Recently, Japanese defenders of whaling have
done an about-face: They now accept that charge wholeheartedly, so
much so that they propose to resume whaling in order to reduce whale
numbers, because whales are (it is claimed) voracious fish-eaters
competing with humans and responsible for recent worldwide declines
in catches of most ocean fish.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to that argument is a no-brainer. Most whale species
don't compete for food with fish-loving humans, because they instead
eat tiny plankton, deep-ocean squid and small fish. The most common
remaining large whale species, the minke whale, consumes mainly krill
(tiny shrimp), plus minor amounts of two species of small fish
(sandeel and capelin) scorned for human consumption. It is
disingenuous to argue that minke whales are taking food off Japanese
tables.</TE>
<TE>   Whales and fish have coexisted for 50 million years, but many
whale populations have declined by more than 90% in the last 200
years because of whaling, so fish numbers should have soared by
Japanese reasoning. In fact, most ocean fisheries have been crashing
recently for an obvious reason: the huge and rising populations of
ocean-going fishing boats, not the vestigial populations of
ocean-going whales. Whales are now eating fewer fish, and humans are
eating more fish, than at any previous time in history.</TE>
<TE>   When the IWC banned commercial whaling, Japan announced that it
too would give up commercial whaling. Within a year, however, it
declared that it would instead carry out something different, called
"scientific whaling," in which whales are supposedly killed to gain
information about their diet and population structure. Of course the
whales thereby killed (this year's target is 700) are still sold for
food, just as were commercially hunted whales.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years of scientific whaling have resulted in only a
handful of papers published in scientific journals to report any
research results. That has led many scientists to conclude that
Japanese whalers are not killing whales to do research but are doing
research as an excuse to kill whales.</TE>
<TE>   Nonlethal methods yield much more information about the questions
addressed by this so-called scientific whaling. Examining whale feces
gives reliable samples of whale diets, while biopsies tell us a
whale's average diet over its lifetime. In contrast, a dead whale's
stomach contents represent only the last meal the whale ate before it
was killed.</TE>
<TE>   We already know plenty about what whales eat from the stomachs of
hundreds of thousands of whales killed in the course of commercial
whaling before the IWC ban. For instance, a 1977 report on the
stomach contents of 53,207 sei whales killed by Japanese whalers
yielded a clear picture: Only 2% of those whales had been eating
fish, while more than 82% had consumed small shrimp. That conclusion
could not possibly be overturned by new knowledge gained from Japan's
planned killing this year of 50 more of this species, which is at
high risk of extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, is Japan so desperate to resume commercial whaling?</TE>
<TE>   One claim the Japanese make is tradition, citing the few coastal
villages with a long history of whaling and the supposed strong
support of the Japanese public for that tradition. But many human
societies have had (or still have) traditions of enslaving or
mutilating other humans, and torturing or mutilating animals for
sport. Those practices don't deserve respect merely because they are
traditional.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there is no groundswell of pro-whaling sentiment in
Japan; most Japanese simply don't care. Instead, in Japan as in many
other countries, the groundswell of public sentiment related to
whales involves whale-watching, a tourist industry that attracted
more than 100,000 Japanese last year.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason cited for resuming whaling is its economic
importance in Japan. Actually, the entire Japanese whale-killing
industry has just a few hundred employees and negligible economic
clout.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese also insist that whales are an important food supply.
But whales make a negligible contribution to Japanese seafood
consumption. Eating most whale meat is unhealthful. Being at the top
of the food chain, whales accumulate mercury and other toxins that
disrupt reproduction of whales (and of humans). At best, some prized
whale species provide a luxury meat sold at $100 per
pound--unaffordable to most Japanese--and is consumed in small
quantities, while nonprized species are used for fertilizer and
animal food.</TE>
<TE>   If Japanese whaling makes no economic sense and is not supported
by public opinion, then why is Japan's government (or actually, its
Fisheries Agency) so passionate about it?</TE>
<TE>   Japan is a densely populated, rich nation that doesn't produce
enough food for its own needs and that depends on imports, especially
of fish. Although whale consumption itself is insignificant, Japan
tenaciously opposes any proposal for international management of
biological resources (even elephant ivory and turtle shell), for fear
of starting down a slippery slope that could lead to restrictions on
access to the world's fish.</TE>
<TE>   But that merely illustrates a tragic irony: Japanese opposition to
sensible international management of biological resources will
ultimately prove more disastrous to import-dependent Japan than to
any other country. Around the world, marine resources--whether
whales, cod, California sardines or anything else--have been hunted
to near-extinction in the same way. The most vocal opponents of
management are typically fishermen themselves, with the result that
the numbers of fish and subsequently the fishermen decline
catastrophically. Now that foolish error is being repeated by the
Japanese, who are endangering their own seafood supplies by
overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   A final irony is that official Japanese support for whaling is
dreadful for Japan's world image. The Japanese are sensitive about
how others view them, but Japan's holdout support for whaling (as
well as its rapacity in international fishing and logging) helps fuel
the worst possible image. For us non-Japanese who have Japanese
friends and relatives, and who see so much to admire in that
remarkable nation, it is sad to see Japan's image dragged into the
mud by hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   That bad image appears to be precipitating a whaling policy
reappraisal within Japan, marked by growing disagreement between the
pro-whaling Fisheries Agency (which is narrowly focused on this
year's seafood imports) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (which
has broader concerns about Japan's long-term interests).</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of the vast majority of Japanese people themselves,
as well as for the whales, the rest of us should do our best to block
Japan's self-destructive rush toward resumption of commercial
whaling.</TE>

<HD>Why We Have More Bad-Air Days</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC B. HAEFELE</AU>
<BD>Marc B. Haefele is a reporter for the LA Weekly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was grim reading for the breathing. Eleven California counties are
among the nation's 25 dirtiest for ozone pollution, according to the
latest survey of the American Lung Assn. Just a few years ago, bad
air was a local problem here--in Los Angeles, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.</LD>
<LD>   Now, says the association, California has got the worst five
counties in the nation: San Bernardino, Kern, Fresno, Riverside,
Tulare. Los Angeles is in eighth place, Merced County ninth and El
Dorado 14th. Sacramento County, where the capital and most of the
state's air resource bureaucracy are located, made it to No. 19 of
the "Dirty 25" for the first time. If our elected officials and their
public vassals can't keep their own air clean, what's the hope for
the rest of us?</LD>
<LD>   Big-city bad air is clearly spreading into small-town California.
Tulare County, with about 374,000 residents, has worse air quality
than L.A. County, with nearly 10 million. And if Los Angeles County,
according to the report, has only slightly worse air than sparsely
peopled Merced County (population of 205,000), what's going on?</LD>
<TE>   Some blame the state's sprawling commuter population, with its
increasingly hours-long drives to and from work spurred by an
expanding population and a serious housing shortage. Or the state's
huge, underregulated agribusiness.</TE>
<TE>   But there might be other causes. And one could be that the
Sacramento agency responsible for abating the state's pollution, the
California Air Resources Board (CARB), hasn't done its best to halt
the spread of bad air.</TE>
<TE>   CARB has a glorious history in the annals of environmental
improvement. As the gatekeeper of the nation's largest automobile
market, it has worked in advance of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency for nearly 35 years, compelling manufacturers to
dramatically reduce their products' pollution. CARB was the first to
demand catalytic converters and countless other refinements, often in
the teeth of industry opposition, and usually got what it wanted.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, CARB carpers complain that the agency has
committed itself to the unrealistic panacea of mandating thousands of
hard-to-sell battery-electric cars. As Consumers Union recently put
it, "Not many people want a car with what amounts to the equivalent
of a 3-gallon tank that takes eight hours to fill." Others have
questioned whether such highly touted CARB programs as its fuel-cell
partnership are advancing that pollution-free technology or simply
hosting junior high science-class trips.</TE>
<TE>   More important, some say, CARB has done less than it could have to
reduce a key source of ever-spreading air pollution--diesel
emissions. Now that a new passenger car gives off fewer emissions
when operating than an inoperative 1982 model does sitting in a
driveway, they say it's time to tackle the nitrous-oxide and
black-smoke-belching motors that power most commercial transportation
and agriculture. Diesels are blamed for some 70% of current
automotive pollution. And recent UCLA and USC studies, as well as
older CARB research, suggest that diesel emissions cause the most
health problems, primarily afflicting people who live within a few
hundred yards of freeways.</TE>
<TE>   But CARB studies also indicate that every cubic meter of the
state's air contains an average of 1.3 micrograms of the diesel
particulates that pass through the body's natural filtration systems
into human lungs and airways. In California's most polluted counties,
according to the lung association, at least 11% of the population has
diseases aggravated by such air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been so much progress in cleaning up cars,'' said Gail
Ruderman Feuer, director of the National Resource Defense Council's
Southern California air quality program. "But there just hasn't been
enough cleaning up of diesels."</TE>
<TE>   Feuer's organization recently worked with the local South Coast
Air Quality Management District on a program that funds the
replacement of thousands of the area's diesel school buses with clean
natural-gas-powered ones. She said CARB ought to be doing the same,
encouraging more natural-gas-powered transit buses, as well as
natural-gas-powered big-rig trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Feuer said, the agency is dragging its feet with a
two-path methodology that offers operators a choice between natural
gas and a "clean diesel" product that many claim cannot be produced
now or even by the time the EPA's new clean-diesel standards kick in.
She cited an April study by CARB that found a natural-gas engine gave
off more emissions than an "equivalent" conventional diesel. But the
diesel used special fuel and had emissions-reduction equipment the
gas engine didn't have, she said. CARB officials say they're redoing
the study. Feuer suggested that CARB may be favoring the diesel
industry because of political pressures.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Jerry Martin, senior CARB spokesman, said: "Well,
that's what they are there for--to say things like that." Martin said
it was just not that easy to get a diesel-free California. For one
thing, the legendary durability of diesel technology can keep these
engines in use for generations. "There are [dirty] diesels out there
up to 50 years old," he said. Some of them can be cleaned up, many
cannot. Most high-polluting big rigs from out of state are beyond
CARB's authority, as are railroad locomotives, aircraft, ships and
even some agricultural equipment.</TE>
<TE>   CARB has been able, through its Carl Moyer incentive program
(named after a late CARB official), to take many ultrahigh-polluting
stationary agricultural diesels out of circulation. But incentive
money comes and goes.</TE>
<TE>   While the Bush administration has, so far, supported its
predecessor's EPA road-diesel cleanup agenda, it has been stuck in
reverse on other air-pollution issues--for instance, the EPA's recent
"new source review" decision that will, its critics say, halt the
cleanup of America's oldest, dirtiest power plants. Even CARB's
toughest critics say they'd hate to see it replaced by Washington's
current EPA.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, CARB can't blame it all on Washington. Other states have done
better with similar problems. During the last five years, a parallel
state agency, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission,
famously helped reduce the pollution standing of the Greater Houston
area from No. 1 in the nation to No. 5 among metropolitan areas. In a
speech at a recent function of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District, Robert Huston, chairman of the Texas commission, attributed
his success to his agency's being able to negotiate. Not just with
local agencies but with entities, such as railroads and shipping
lines and even Mexican maquiladoras, over which it had no legal
authority. "And you always have to find incentives," he said last
week--even if that means persuading your own budget-strapped state to
provide them.</TE>

<AU>JOE LOYA</AU>
<BD>Joe Loya is an associate editor at Pacific News
Service. His memoir "The Parole of Buddha Lobo" will be out next
year.</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>I watched with interest the recent announcement of the arrest of
Abdullah al Muhajir--born Jose Padilla--a U.S. citizen and former
Chicago street gang member who converted to Islam and is now believed
to have been plotting with Al Qaeda to explode a "dirty bomb."</LD>
<LD>   He and I could have been good friends in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Seven years ago, from my federal prison cell, I watched on
television the destruction of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City. My first thought: "Good, the U.S. government needs
to suffer some casualties in this war on crime. They need to learn
that it ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun."</LD>
<TE>   It was easy for me as a federal prisoner to affiliate myself with
the enemy of my enemy. I justified Timothy McVeigh's murder of
innocent people, thinking of it as "collateral damage." People of
good conscience, I rationalized, used the same justification to blast
the innocent of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Prisons are full of political throwbacks who haven't seen freedom
in 20 or 30 years. You see older men in a time warp, wearing widely
flared bell-bottom pants that were fashionable when they were last
out on the streets. Some prisoners' politics are similarly dated.</TE>
<TE>   In federal custody, I was in a solitary confinement unit with a
bank robber named Queito who fasted during Ramadan as an expression
of solidarity with Palestinians. He wasn't Muslim, but in his mind
the Palestinians had their homeland stolen and were oppressed in much
the same way as Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Queito fancied himself a Marxist revolutionary of the Che Guevara
stripe. He was committed to a reconquest of the U.S. Southwest--the
mythical birthplace of the state of Aztlan. He passed out Chicano
scholar Rodolfo Acuna's book "Occupied America" to semiliterate
Mexican gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Acuna espoused the separatist gospel that "Anglo
control of Mexico's northwest territory [the U.S. Southwest] is an
occupation." In Queito's imagination, he and the Palestinians had a
similar "stolen lands" quarrel with all colonialist governments of
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Once, while locked in my cell during the Gulf War, I heard an
excited inmate named Toro yell out to Queito that he'd seen the war
footage and that "we" were blowing the Iraqis away. "Who is the 'we'
you are talking about?" Queito shot back. "You have solidarity with a
government that has you locked in handcuffs right now?"</TE>
<TE>   It would have been easy for Jose Padilla, doing time in Illinois,
to become politicized by a radical leftist like Queito. No doubt he
was preached to by some aging supporter of the Chicago-based Armed
Forces of National Liberation (FALN), a Puerto Rican group that
planted bombs to protest "the imperialist state" in the 1970s and
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Latino Muslims were common in prison. My friend "Panama" was one
of them. He spoke in broken English, wore a traditional Muslim cap
and prayed five times a day.</TE>
<TE>   There reside in the Latino consciousness at least three historical
grudges, three conflicting selves: the Muslim Moor, the Catholic
Spanish and the indigenous Indian. You see the internal conflict
manifested when the light-skinned, middle-class, Catholic Mexican
American girl from Reseda goes to Stanford and goes indigenous,
adopting a new Aztec princess name, Xochitl.</TE>
<TE>   The old Latin American revolutionaries converted to atheism, but
the new faux revolutionary Latino American prisoner can just as
easily convert to Islam. In the end, both choices are a sort of
adolescent rebellion against authority--in this case, the Catholic
Church.</TE>
<TE>   I understand that rebellion, the desire to highlight my indigenous
roots over the conquistador in me.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time in prison when I contemplated getting out and
raising funds for Mexico's revolutionary Zapatistas by robbing
American banks. I was a thief, but I wanted to be a criminal soldier
with a cause, like Zapata and Pancho Villa.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement is partially to blame for the phenomenon of
the street gang member dreaming of becoming such a warrior. Law
enforcement has employed the metaphors and language of warfare to
fight drug addicts and petty thieves. It was only a matter of time
before simple thugs like me and Queito began to see ourselves at war
with the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Although I am Mexican American, the FBI named me "The Beirut
Bandit" when they were chasing me, because tellers said I looked
Lebanese, or Iranian, or Pakistani. Like Jose Padilla, once upon a
time I could have entertained the thought of lending criminal support
to the Palestinians or other Arabs I resembled in appearance--and
with whom I shared a grudge against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Jose Padilla and I could no longer be friends. On TV, I saw
the World Trade Center bombing and I felt sorrow for the gaping hole
torn in the body politic. I was repulsed by the carnage because today
my heart doesn't celebrate hate or mayhem. I'm no longer at war with
the government--or with myself.</TE>

<KH>DRUG ABUSE</KH>
<HD>The President's Experience Should Shape His Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM C. MOYERS</AU>
<BD>William C. Moyers is vice president of external affairs
for the Hazelden Foundation. His personal experiences were the basis
for the 1998 public television series, "Moyers on Addiction: Close to
Home."</BD>
<DL>CENTER CITY, Minn.</DL>
<LD>If only America's so-called war on drugs could be recast in the
spirit of my chance meeting with President Bush last year in the
White House Rose Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. President, my name is William Moyers, I'm from Minnesota and
I am a person in recovery," I said.</LD>
<LD>   Without batting an eye, the president grasped my hand and replied,
"Sounds like we have something in common."</LD>
<TE>   I was all but a complete stranger to Bush. But in that moment we
connected. And because I told him nothing else about me, I assume it
was from the commonality of our experiences of having overcome the
desperate condition of drinking too much.</TE>
<TE>   I am a recovering alcoholic and addict. Whether the president
labels himself the same, I don't know. But on that day at least, Bush
knew exactly where I was coming from because, by his own account, he
once drank too much and now he doesn't drink at all.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, our handshake occurred just after the president had
used the Rose Garden ceremony to announce his nomination of John P.
Walters as the nation's drug czar. Critics within the drug policy
reform movement denounced the appointment, saying Walters' track
record showed he was no friend of addicted people. What's more,
Walters has said he sees addiction as a moral or criminal issue,
rather than an illness. In policy terms, that translates into funds
going to law enforcement and supply suppression rather than to the
kind of treatment programs that helped me and thousands of others.</TE>
<TE>   But flush with optimism that finally we had a president who
understood the power of addiction and the possibility of recovery, I
urged restraint in opposing the Walters nomination. Maybe now, I
argued to my fellow policy reform advocates, the president's own
experience would allow his administration to refocus the war on
drugs, promoting effective prevention and treatment programs over
previous policies that emphasized interdiction and tough law
enforcement. My position was met with criticism from my colleagues in
the addiction treatment field, solicited an angry call from a U.S.
senator and sparked disdain from some of my fellow recovering
alcoholics.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Senate approved Walters' nomination, after both he
and the president spoke repeatedly about narrowing the treatment gap
for the 3.5 million people that the federal government estimates need
treatment but are not seeking help. For a while at least, it appeared
that the administration's approach had been tempered by the reality
that America's war on drugs required a more balanced approach.</TE>
<TE>   And then Sept. 11 happened, which abruptly rewrote the national
agenda. Suddenly the war on drugs became an adjunct to the war on
terrorism. The Office of National Drug Control Policy has run
distasteful television ads equating teenage drug use with support for
terrorists, part of a $185-million-a-year media blitz that Walters
now admits has been ineffective. Proposed funding for prevention and
treatment of drug addiction did increase in the president's 2003
budget--as did federal dollars for interdiction and law enforcement.
But the fact remains that two-thirds of the $19 billion the Bush
administration wants to spend fighting drugs merely targets the
supply--rather than treating the demand.</TE>
<TE>   I had hope for a more balanced approach. The first family knows
all about underage drinking and the problems it causes. And earlier
this year the media reported that a relative of the president was
arrested and ended up in treatment after forging a prescription for a
tranquilizer in Florida. Surely these personal experiences would
resonate at the White House, leading to a saner drug policy for all
of us.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it was not to be. In April, the president spoke out in favor
of more equitable insurance coverage for people struggling with
debilitating mental illnesses like depression and bipolar disorder.
But he left out any mention of the illness that his family and mine
know well--alcoholism and drug dependence.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit foundation I work for extends about $5 million a
year in financial aid to addicted people and their families seeking
treatment. Ironically, most of this assistance goes to employed
people whose private health care insurance won't pay for the
professional and comprehensive help they need to overcome their
illness. In Congress, legislation to fix this disparity draws strong
opposition from some of Bush's biggest political supporters,
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the insurance industry.
When it comes to the politics of addiction, it seems the president
has more in common with his campaign contributors than he does with
people like me.</TE>
<TE>   Yet treatment for addiction does work. According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, treatment cuts drug use by
about 50%, reported alcohol and drug-related medical illnesses
decline by more than half and criminal activity drops by as much as
80%.</TE>
<TE>   And recovery benefits all of society. When people like me stop
using and abusing, we stop demanding Colombia's cocaine,
Afghanistan's heroin and Mexico's marijuana. We get back to work, pay
taxes, obey the law and vote. And once in a rare while, one of us who
changed our drug or alcohol habits gets a chance to be president of
the United States.</TE>

<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Phillips' most recent book is "Wealth and
Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The lurid 2002 portrait of the U.S. economy as a bunch of Enrons and
Tycos, overpaid CEOs running corporations like casinos, electronic
speculators, predatory hedge funds, fraudulent stock values,
deceptive investment firms and collusive accountants didn't develop
overnight. Unfortunately, while some of the excesses may shrink, they
are not likely to fade away.</LD>
<LD>   That's because much of the "financialization" that occurred in the
1980s and 1990s has been built into the system, save for the possible
purgative of a market crash. The most visible evidence of this--the
mushrooming of CEO compensation and the private sector's "imperial
corporate presidency"--ironically parallels the dangerous growth and
hubris of the governmental "imperial presidency" in the 1960s and
early 1970s. Unhappily, reform of business and finance may be harder
to achieve this decade than were the public-sector reforms following
Watergate. Washington's business and financial lobbies are
mobilizing.</LD>
<TE>   Over the past 20 years, the U.S. economy has been reoriented from
making, growing, building and transporting things to moving,
massaging and manipulating money and securities. So great has this
transformation been that by the mid-1990s, the finance, insurance and
real estate (FIRE) sector had raced ahead of manufacturing in
gross-domestic-product and national-income numbers. By 2001, the FIRE
sector had pulled ahead of manufacturing in profits; in the 1960s,
manufacturing led by 4 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   This staggering displacement isn't a blip, even though some
yardsticks, like CEO compensation and financial profits, may have
peaked for now. Examples of previous world economic powers suggest
that once a nation's financialization escalates to this extent, it
becomes systemic and isn't easily reversed.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1920s, under the spell of a soaring stock market, the
United States underwent some kindred changes. Market volume
ballooned; mutual funds sprang into being; consumer loans caught on
and debt surged. Americans were mesmerized by ticker tapes. However,
during the three years after the bubble burst in 1929, stocks fell so
low, so many banks failed and so much business and financial dirty
laundry came into view that Americans soured on corporations, banks
and stocks. President Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed through hundreds
of reform laws and regulations, and the harsh economics of the Great
Depression put finance through a wringer.</TE>
<TE>   The shenanigans played by Enron, Arthur Andersen and a number of
major banks and investment firms, with corporate names being added
each week, resemble the financial and corporate dirty laundry exposed
from 1930 to 1933. Toward the end of manic booms, frauds and swindles
run rampant, inevitably employing techniques that evade the
strictures of outdated legislation and regulation. In theory, new
legislation and regulation could restore order in 2002-2004. The
rebuttal, though, is that the financialization of the United States
is deep and pervasive enough to make the speculative beginners' games
of the 1920s look like a real-economy study group.</TE>
<TE>   Consider two barometers. Between 1919 and 1929, the volume of
stocks traded increased eightfold, and the amount of money in mutual
funds climbed from a few million to $8.5 billion. Between 1980 and
2000, by contrast, the volume of stocks traded on the major exchanges
increased by roughly 50 times, and mutual-fund assets soared from
$135 billion to $7.8 trillion. Many Americans closed savings and
checking accounts and put their cash or assets into money market or
stock funds.</TE>
<TE>   So bolstered, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped from 775 in
summer 1982 to 11,700 in early 2000. The Nasdaq skyrocketed from
around 120 in 1982 to just above 5,000 in early 2000. At the same
time, the rapid computerization of the financial sector made possible
a whole new spectrum of speculative instruments and vehicles for the
securitization of loans and income streams. This accounts for part of
the financial sector's growth.</TE>
<TE>   Government favoritism accounts for another chunk. Beginning in the
early 1980s, the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury and allies
like the International Monetary Fund embarked on a two-decade march
of bailing out failing or shaky portions of the U.S. and
international financial sectors. Among those rescued: Latin American
bond issuers; the stock market after the 1987 crash; S&amp;L creditors
and depositors; the Mexican peso and its U.S. bondholders; Asian
currencies; the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management; and banks
menaced by the Y2K scare.</TE>
<TE>   As the financial sector, in short, became too important to fail,
the Fed and the Treasury abandoned market economics to embrace
socialization of credit risk. No other sector of the U.S. economy,
save possibly defense, received such governmental assistance. In the
early 1980s, some in Washington had urged a government industrial
policy to rescue manufacturing. What we got instead--there was no
official announcement--was a "financial policy."</TE>
<TE>   All this had a frenetic effect on corporate executives determined
to share in the feast. In the 1980s and 1990s, top executives gave
many U.S. corporations a financial tuneup. Some, like American Can
and General Electric, became financial companies in whole or in part.
Others recalibrated corporate success in financial terms--quarterly
profits, stock options, creative accounting, currency arbitrage and
derivatives trading, employee and benefits reduction--to raise the
company's stock price and give senior management a seat at
capitalism's high table.</TE>
<TE>   This corporate reorientation fed the stock market's rise, which,
in turn, fed the buccaneering chief executives. Business Week
magazine, which annually charts top-executive compensation in the
U.S., found that between 1981-2000 the average package of the 10
highest-compensated U.S. executives had rocketed from $3.45 million
to $155 million.</TE>
<TE>   The last time such self-aggrandizing management practices occurred
was during what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the imperial
presidencies of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M.
Nixon. These administrations were associated with proliferating White
House staffs, special operating funds, espionage apparatchiks,
military retinues, aircraft and helicopters and an escalating sense
of global omnipotence and hubris.</TE>
<TE>   What we have seen over the last two decades is the swelling
arrogance, hubris and excess of the private sector, led by Wall
Street's "masters of the universe" and the executive-suite monarchs
of the imperial corporate presidency. But reform won't be easy, given
that the overall finance (FIRE) sector is Washington's biggest
spending lobby and No. 1 writer of checks to politicians.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that the Nasdaq crash, topped by Enron, Tyco and the
rest of the frauds and swindles, may become the private-sector
equivalent of Watergate, especially if more market declines are
ahead. Public demand for regulatory and legislative reform, although
considerable, still falls short of the crisis level needed to
overcome the Washington lobbies and big political donors.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a deeper market crisis could come if growing public
suspicion of financial and regulatory integrity makes it impossible
to sustain today's very high price-earnings ratios. Despite the
collapse of the Nasdaq, price-earning ratios, overall, remain at
boom-period highs. Should they merely decline to bear-market norms,
the various stock indexes could lose another 25% to 40%. John and
Jane Q. Public in the suburbs are already nervous at the prospect of
their 401(k) retirement plans becoming 201(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is a given, and it's hard to know what odds to
assign. Even so, the history of the leading world economic powers
before the United States does underscore the danger. In their later
stages, both Holland and Britain were rapidly financializing and
losing commitment to their old "real-economy" livelihoods. For
several decades, the financialization appeared to succeed, although
the polarization between the rich and everyone else rapidly widened
in the two countries. However, at a certain point, usually involving
wartime stress, each nation's debt structure and global network of
finance, communications and commercial services become vulnerable.
Starting a war with Iraq--on top of anti-terrorist
mobilization--could become a U.S. equivalent.</TE>
<TE>   But if these latter aspects are conjecture, the rapid onset of the
financialization of the U.S. economy in 1980s and 1990s is not. The
Sept. 11 terrorist struck at finance--the World Trade Center--not at
industry or agriculture. There is more new about the United States of
the 21st century than many Americans realize.</TE>

<AU>ALEX RICCIARDULLI</AU>
<BD>Alex Ricciardulli is a Los Angeles County deputy public
defender and adjunct professor at Loyola Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To satisfy the huge appetite for jurors under the one-day, one-trial
rule, Los Angeles County courts have embarked on a path that could
undermine the right to jury trial in both civil and criminal cases.
One of the first steps has been to try to accelerate trials by
curtailing attorneys' ability to question potential jurors for
fairness and impartiality during jury selection. With the courts
favoring such measures as eliminating jury trials for some cases, the
question is whether they are on a slippery slope to impaired
standards of justice.</LD>
<LD>   The one-day, one-trial system commendably reduces the burden on
individuals called for jury duty, a vast improvement over its
nightmarish predecessor. No more forced congregation in stuffy
jury-assembly rooms waiting for the call of public service; no more
second and third chances after rejection; no more shuffling from
courtroom to courtroom, day after day. Individuals could spend up to
10 days in this mill, never serving on a jury. For most, the
experience left a bitter aftertaste.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new regimen, anyone not chosen to serve on a jury the
first day is excused from serving again for at least a year. Anyone
selected for a jury must serve until the trial is completed, but this
is not as bad as it sounds because most trials usually end within a
week.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is, without the ability to recycle potential jurors
from one day to the next, many more people than ever will have to be
summoned. From Pomona to Santa Monica and Lancaster to Long Beach,
L.A. County provides courtrooms for more than 9.5 million people.
This is the largest court system in the U.S., if not the world. It is
estimated that 10,000 people will need to be called each week to keep
one-day, one-trial humming, an enormous requirement that makes
attempts to ease the demand for warm bodies entirely understandable.</TE>
<TE>   Minimizing attorney voir dire, however, is a move in the wrong
direction. Under the courts' new rule, the judge would conduct the
questioning, with attorneys getting 10 minutes per side to ask
questions in misdemeanor cases and 20 minutes for felonies. In civil
cases, attorney voir dire would be limited to 20 to 30 minutes for
each side. That works out to fewer than two minutes per juror in
felony trials, hardly enough time to ask meaningful questions, let
alone to receive answers.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-attorney voir dire protocol is largely a rerun of the
disastrous 10-year experiment inaugurated by Proposition 115 in 1990,
under which judges in criminal cases did all the questioning.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys complained that the system resulted
in incomplete questioning, leaving parties mostly in the dark about
the composition of juries. The outcome was legislation, effective
last year in L.A. County, that provides parties in all trials the
"right to examine, by oral and direct questioning, any or all of the
prospective jurors."</TE>
<TE>   One reason attorney voir dire was restored was the perception that
the number of hung juries had increased after judges did all the
questioning. Deprived of voir dire, parties were unable to ferret out
potentially aberrant jurors. It would be the height of irony if the
new attempt to shave off trial minutes resulted in days or weeks of
jury time being wasted because of hung juries. Such an outcome would
be financially devastating to clients of civil practitioners, who
would get stuck with the bills for additional time spent by their
lawyers in retrials.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts of a Blue Ribbon Commission on Jury System Improvement
in 1996 may be a harbinger of more changes in the name of efficiency.
The commission, which included practicing attorneys but was led by
judges, called upon the justice community "to make individual
sacrifices that will redound to the benefit of all" and acknowledged
that some of its recommendations "may create discomfort among one or
more groups." Included were proposals to eradicate jury trials for
misdemeanors not carrying jail time; reducing the size of juries from
12 to eight in some cases; and allowing nonunanimous--11 to 1--jury
verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, these and other changes to speed up trials would be
outweighed by the ensuing detriment to justice. Wiping out jury
trials for any cases is a dreadful idea. The right to a trial before
a jury is embedded in the nation's culture and confers legitimacy on
the criminal trial process. Reducing juries' size would profoundly
affect the diversity of jury panels, because fewer jurors means fewer
opportunities for minorities to serve. Allowing nonunanimous verdicts
would dangerously dilute the importance of jurors' individual
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Given the expected popularity of one-day, one-trial, the system is
probably here to stay, and ways should be found to keep pace up with
its demands. The focus, however, should be on increasing the supply
of jurors, rather than limiting their demand.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-area homeowners who believe their houses are covered with
Exterior Insulation and Finish System, a synthetic stucco product,
may be eligible to receive cash compensation, free property
inspections, extended warranties and other benefits of a class-action
suit, an attorney said last week.</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiffs in the case against Dryvit Systems Inc. allege that
Dryvit EIFS traps moisture between the house wall and the exterior
faux-stucco material, potentially causing damage to residences, said
Gary Mason, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles is one of the cities nationwide where the synthetic
stucco materials were widely distributed, Mason said. He added that
the impact of the alleged defects has been more widely reported in
damp climates, such as Texas and the northwestern United States.</LD>
<TE>   Houses do not have to be damaged for homeowners to participate in
the lawsuit, Mason said. One must simply have owned a one- or
two-story home or town house as of June 5, 2002, that is partially or
wholly covered with Dryvit EIFS, installed after Jan. 1, 1989.
Affected homeowners may be entitled to a free home inspection, a
three-year extended warranty and a cash settlement toward repair
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Parties who think they are eligible to join the lawsuit should
call (800) 320-9415 or visit www.stuccosettlement.com.</TE>

<HD>Vacationing Owners Lose Their Condo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We bought a condo in California because we did not want the
bother of having to hire gardeners and other responsibilities that
come with owning a home. We paid for it in full so we would not have
a mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   We bought the largest unit in a prime location and installed
state-of-the-art fixtures and appliances, wood floors and copper
plumbing. But we learned quickly the other homeowners didn't like us
because we did not partake in association activities.</LD>
<LD>   We decided to retire and take a vacation sailing for nearly two
years. We paid our homeowner association dues, utilities and property
taxes upfront. We notified the board and neighbors of the sailing
trip and how long we would be gone.</LD>
<TE>   Upon return, a stranger was living in our condo. Apparently in our
absence, homeowners rallied their friends on the board to fine us for
a collection of contrived violations. Then they made sure the
association raised the amount of regular monthly dues and voted to
specially assess for new garage doors, something the board assured us
they would not do.</TE>
<TE>   We were unaware that outstanding fees and fines existed, so we
obviously couldn't pay them.</TE>
<TE>   In our absence, the board wasted no time placing a lien on our
home, then nonjudicially foreclosed.</TE>
<TE>   The association put our personal belongings in storage, and when
we "failed to retrieve them in a timely manner," they sold them at a
garage sale and sent us the storage bill.</TE>
<TE>   They now threaten court action for storage fees.</TE>
<TE>   Our attorneys explained that because of the time lapse between
foreclosure and our objection to it, we have no recourse against the
association. Even the homestead on our home did not prevent the
foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Must we pay the storage fees and can we get back our personal
belongings? Can we sue the board and our neighbors for foreclosing?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: California legislators apparently did not anticipate that
people living in common interest developments sometimes take extended
vacations, and that merely following the law, as your board
presumptively did, would expose the homeowner to the devastating loss
of such a large asset.</TE>
<TE>   The law protects boards and their actions, and there are no
penalties for a board that uses the law against homeowners.
California Code section 703.010 lists property exempt from attachment
by a judgment creditor.</TE>
<TE>   However, in section (b) the law says that the exemptions do not
apply if the judgment is for the foreclosure involving a lien
encumbrance on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Your homeowner association placed a lien on your home, which began
the road to foreclosure. A homestead only protects a portion of the
equity you have in your home from judgment creditors. Whether the
actions of your board constituted some form of embezzlement or fraud,
those acts did not serve to make the board judgment creditors.</TE>
<TE>   This loophole allowing foreclosures in common interest
developments for failure to pay regular, or in your case, special
assessments without providing actual notice to the homeowner is an
issue the Legislature has not addressed.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the regular monthly fees you paid in
advance, and the new amount voted in by your board, can also become a
lien against your property.</TE>
<TE>   The board's legal duty is to repair, replace and maintain the
common property. The board's fiduciary duty is to treat all
homeowners fairly and assure that their homes will not be taken from
them as was yours.</TE>
<TE>   An honorable attorney knows the board owes this fiduciary duty to
all the homeowners and would not advise a board to foreclose under
circumstances like these without ensuring that the homeowner received
actual notice. Constructive notice, permitted by law, is insufficient
when your home and lifetime possessions are at risk.</TE>
<TE>   While legally it may be enough for a board to follow the minimum
requirements permitted by law regarding notice of assessments and
possible foreclosure, in a case like yours, where your board knew you
were going to be away, the duty owed to you, it seems to us, rose to
a higher level.</TE>
<TE>   A qualified lawyer can determine if you have a cause of action
against your board for their acts in foreclosing on your home. You
also need a second, even a third, legal opinion in hopes of
uncovering a misstep in the prior court proceedings to overturn the
results of the board's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering storage fees or the value of your possessions will
depend on the board's following all the required procedural steps
before the taking of your property.</TE>
<TE>   If the storage company's sale of your belongings also failed to
follow the required procedure, it could be liable to you for the
value of those possessions.</TE>

<HD>When in Doubt, DISCLOSE</HD>
<DH>Home sellers are required by law to tell buyers what's
wrong with a property. If you're not sure whether a defect is worth
noting, ask yourself: 'Would I want to know about this?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Bening thought she and her husband, Steve, had bought their
dream home: a $343,000, two-story Spanish-style house in Chino Hills
with views of the twinkling lights of the Inland Empire below to Mt.
Baldy above.</LD>
<LD>   But in October 1997, when the Benings moved in, they discovered
the house was slowly breaking apart. A crack running up a wall in the
master bedroom was their first clue. Tracking the fissure down the
wall, Terry lifted the bedroom's carpeting and discovered a  3/4
inch-wide gap in the foundation running almost the entire length of
the north side of the house.</LD>
<LD>   "The previous owner had put a large armoire in the corner [where
the crack was]," Terry said, "and a tall potted plant. They had
hidden the problem." As a result, she said, both the Benings and
their home inspector had missed it.</LD>
<TE>   What the previous owners had not done during escrow, according to
Terry, was disclose that about one-third of the house--built in
1989--had been constructed on unstable land and was slowly starting
to sink and break apart.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, California law requires home defects to be disclosed
by sellers during escrow on a Transfer Disclosure Statement. The
three-page form asks sellers to tell all about their home--everything
from whether the oven is in good working condition to whether the
home has had major damage from a fire, earthquake, flood or
landslide.</TE>
<TE>   After consulting numerous engineers, the Benings, both 49, now
know that their dream house is slowly sinking and shifting at a rate
of 1/12 of an inch a year. "I've lost the feeling of home as a safe
place," said Terry, a college professor.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-year legal battle that began in 1998, the Benings
have recovered some costs from the listing agent and the home
inspector. But the funds have barely covered their legal costs, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Benings are not able to receive compensation from the sellers,
who knew of the problem, because they filed for bankruptcy. And the
courts found the builder is free from obligation because the statute
of limitations--in this case, three years after the first homeowner
had discovered the problem--had run out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "My husband and I will have to pay for this problem," Terry said.
"It's a slow process, but eventually [the house] could collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the threat of lawsuits, sellers sometimes conceal issues
about their home they feel will break a deal. But often, sellers have
lived in a home so long they don't notice a leaking pipe or think to
mention that water collects at the doorway in a driving rain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, other sellers fear disclosing something like a death or
murder in the home will stigmatize their house right out of the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Effron, a Los Angeles-based attorney who specializes in real
estate law, said a good way to eliminate guesswork about disclosure
is to ask yourself: "If I were a buyer, is this something I would
want to know?"</TE>
<TE>   All sorts of issues and sticking points can arise during escrow as
a result of the gray areas on disclosure--everything from how much
water pressure there is in the shower to one San Fernando Valley
seller who wanted to disclose that her house was haunted by her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was bizarre," said real estate agent Jerry Berns,
59, who, along with all real estate agents, also have a
responsibility to do a visual inspection of all accessible areas of a
property and disclose anything they find. "But I did think about
disclosing it. The acid test for disclosure is anything that could
conceivably make a difference to a buyer." (Ultimately, the presence
of the purported ghost was not disclosed.)</TE>
<TE>   To get all the facts, real estate agents usually sit down with a
seller for at least an hour to go over the house's history. During
this meeting, sellers will check off items on the Transfer Disclosure
Statement, or TDS, as it is known. If sellers have a big problem to
disclose, they are encouraged to use additional pages for
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The only downside to this," said James Joseph, owner of Century
21 Grisham-Joseph in Whittier, "is now we have a paper blizzard.
Years ago we had far fewer forms to fill out."</TE>
<TE>   While the majority of problems arising from nondisclosure occur
accidentally, some homeowners--such as the Benings--believe they were
set up to buy flawed property.</TE>
<TE>   Russell and Donna Merriweather bought their first home for
$189,000 in September 1999 in the Leimert Park area of Los Angeles.
According to Russell, a counselor who works with substance abusers
and developmentally disabled adults, two days after moving in, he and
Donna discovered the walls of the back corner of the master bedroom
were eroded and rotted away due to water damage from a leaking roof.
The walls had been cosmetically patched and painted, according to
Russell, and furniture and boxes had prevented a complete visual
inspection of the area when the couple walked through the property.</TE>
<TE>   "When we opened up the wall," said Russell, 51, "we were
devastated."</TE>
<TE>   "I should have been more aggressive during escrow," Russell said.
"No one disclosed that there was water damage to the roof." Both the
agents representing the Merriweathers and the seller of the home said
they were not aware of the damage either.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, Russell waived his right to a home inspection, which
could have caught the problem and potentially put a brake on escrow
until the seller had either reduced the price of the home or had it
repaired. But even inspectors can miss problems--as in the Bening
case--or can't get access to areas of the house because of an
accumulation of furniture and junk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Mary Gafner discovered a crack in the foundation of the
garage of their Tustin home after escrow closed. An inspector missed
the problem because of a mountain of boxes and toys stacked in the
garage.</TE>
<TE>   Not having access to certain areas should be referenced in the
inspector's report, according to Coldwell Banker real estate agent
Janet Loveland. But, Loveland said, that shouldn't be the end of it.
"A buyer should ask that the stuff be removed so a second inspection
can happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Gafners--who were first-time home buyers--decided to live with
the crack.</TE>
<TE>   "We were naive," said Mary, 42. "You just have to cover every
square inch when you buy a house. You have to make the buyers move
things around to see things."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, a homeowner learns of a problem with a property by
happenstance. First-time home buyer Ken Sandberg paid $205,000 for a
1,400-square-foot ranch-style home in Simi Valley in February 1997.
Three months later, Sandberg, who works in computer support for Walt
Disney Feature Animation, found a note on his front door from the
Ventura County Assessor's office asking if the property's earthquake
damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake had been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Shocked, because no such damage had been disclosed during escrow,
Sandberg learned through extensive research that his home had
withstood so much damage during the 6.7 temblor that the county had
assessed the home's structural value at nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Sandberg has learned that during the earthquake, the
garage separated from the house and the swimming pool was no longer
level. Additionally, he discovered the house sustained a 6-foot-long
crack about  3/4-inch wide under the kitchen floor, a 1-inch-wide
crack running the width of the house in the home's slab and damage to
the home's foundation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sandberg, the previous homeowner's repair of the
damage was improperly done. "If the wind would blow, the house would
creak."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most nondisclosure lawsuits, which end up settling out of
court, Sandberg won a legal judgment against the sellers and the
sellers' real estate company to have his purchase of the property
rescinded plus full repayment of attorney's fees--about $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sandberg would eventually have the house seized by the sheriff
from the previous owners for nonpayment of his judgment. The house
would then be sold two more times: at a sheriff's auction and by
another owner who placed the home in a trust, which like homes in
probate and foreclosure, do not have to meet the same disclosure
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the couple who live in the house today knew nothing
of its previous problems until, Sandberg said, he knocked on their
door and told them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of the lucky ones," Sandberg said. "I got out of this
mess.... The people that own the house now are the victims."</TE>

<TE>   How to Question Disclosures</TE>
<TE>   Advice for not getting tripped up on disclosure:</TE>
<TE>   * Question any items of concern listed on the Transfer Disclosure
Statement.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask seller questions about the house or neighborhood not listed
on the Transfer Disclosure Statement.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure your agent provides you with a current Transfer
Disclosure Statement, which is updated frequently. (The most recent
form is dated October 2001.)</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure your inspector is a California Real Estate Inspection
Assn. member and be present at the inspection.</TE>
<TE>   * Request that necessary repairs be made by appropriately licensed
professionals.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Does a seller have to disclose a death that occurred on the property?
In 1983, the California Court of Appeals ruled that a homeowner had
the responsibility to disclose to a potential home buyer that a
multiple murder had occurred on a property 10 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "This established the law," said attorney Gary Effron, that a
known death on a property should be disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   But that ruling was scaled back by the Legislature, first in 1986
with the enactment of California Civil Code 1710.2, which said that a
seller did not have to disclose an AIDS-related death on the property
if it occurred more than three years prior, and then again in 1987
when that code was amended to include any type of death.</LD>
<TE>   So what about a death that occurred less than three years ago?</TE>
<TE>   While this is still a gray area in California law, Effron
interprets it to mean that because the code does not specifically
address more recent murders or deaths, those cases should be covered
by the 1983 Court of Appeals ruling and be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line? Disclosure about death--no matter the timeline or
cause--is always best.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are spooked by death," he said. "If you think a
buyer will be creeped out by something, then it's best to disclose."</TE>

<HD>Keep Mildew in Check by Reducing Moisture in Room</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have a mildew problem on the ceiling above my shower. I
do not have a window in the bathroom. I want to paint, but am worried
it might just be covering a problem instead of repairing it. I use
bleach about every two weeks to clean the ceiling and walls, and it
makes the mildew go away for a few days. What is the best thing to
do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Mildew in your home is easy to remove. Just mix 1/3 cup of
powdered laundry detergent (less if concentrated) and 1 quart of
liquid chlorine bleach with 3 quarts of warm water. Add the bleach to
the water first and then the detergent. Scrub with a bristle brush.
In minutes the mildew will disappear.</LD>
<LD>   Rinse the area thoroughly and towel-dry. Although this reasonably
mild solution can be used for most painted surfaces, rubber gloves,
eye protection and plenty of ventilation are necessary.</LD>
<TE>   In the future, don't spend time removing mildew when you can
prevent it. Mildew can't grow without a food source, and the food
source that mildew thrives on is moisture. Mildew spores are in the
air, and they look for moist places to settle, feed and grow.</TE>
<TE>   How do you prevent mildew from growing? Reduce or eliminate the
food source by cutting the amount of moisture, usually condensation,
that settles on walls, floors and ceilings. Eradication is possible
even in humid climates.</TE>
<TE>   Not having a window in your bathroom means ventilation might be
poor. Moreover, the lack of natural light provides optimal conditions
for mildew growth.</TE>
<TE>   A bathroom without a window should have an exhaust fan to remove
moisture and odors. Unfortunately, bath fans are often undersized,
broken or simply not used.</TE>
<TE>   If you have an exhaust fan, make sure that it is cleaned
periodically, that the duct is properly connected and in good shape,
and that it is always used during showering and allowed to run for 10
to 15 minutes after the shower.</TE>
<TE>   Also, check the CFM rating on your fan housing (that's the amount
of air the fan moves expressed as cubic feet per minute). Anything
less than 80 CFMs is usually too small for most American bathrooms.
Consider upgrading to a larger model.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Test Concrete Moisture Before Installing Carpet</TE>
<TE>   Q: When installing indoor-outdoor carpet, should I trim, then glue
to concrete or glue, then trim?</TE>
<TE>   A: First, be sure that the concrete slab is clean and dry. Check
for moisture problems by securely taping a 12-inch-square piece of
plastic sheeting to the slab, using duct tape. If moisture appears
between the plastic and the slab, it should be sealed with a
high-quality concrete sealer.</TE>
<TE>   Use a stair tool (a large chisel-like tool) to seat and crease the
edge of the carpet into the joint between the floor and the wall.
Finish the job by trimming the carpet with a utility knife.</TE>

<TE>   Tankless Heaters: Lower Bills--and Lower Volume</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a gas water heater. I was thinking of replacing it with
what I believe is called a set system, a set of heating coils that
attaches to the main water feed. The system gives hot water only when
it is needed, eliminating the need to heat water continuously. Where
can I find such a system? Is it more economical?</TE>
<TE>   A: You refer to a "tankless" water-heating system, which does not
store heated water.</TE>
<TE>   The tankless system is the most energy-efficient because hot water
is not being continuously reheated in a storage tank. The only time
the tankless type uses energy is when the hot-water faucet is open.</TE>
<TE>   These systems are in wide use around the world, but Americans have
shied away from them because they do not produce high volumes of
water. For example, with a tankless system you may find it difficult
to maintain warm water when the clothes washer is in operation at the
same time both bathrooms are in use.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remove Door Trim to Reglue Damaged Area</TE>
<TE>   Q: The door-latch side of my door frame is broken. Would you tell
me how to replace it?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you can, try to patch the jamb (door frame).</TE>
<TE>   First, remove the trim piece from the door frame that travels
vertically down its center. Use a razor knife to put a slit in the
paint between the trim and the frame, so that it can be removed
without damage. One or both casings (trim molding between the door
frame and the wall) also should be removed, depending on whether
either would restrict the repair. With the trim removed, you can
easily reglue the damaged section or cut it out and patch it. A
jigsaw is best for cutting out a damaged piece.</TE>
<TE>   Use lots of glue and plenty of screws or nails to connect the new
piece. Remember, with the stop and the casing removed, you are
dealing simply with a long, narrow, flat piece of wood that is held
to the framed door opening with nails and shim-shingles.</TE>

<HD>Malibu Is a Hit With TV Host</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Clark has purchased a 12-acre Malibu home known as Gull's Way
for close to $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   The multiple Emmy-winning producer-TV host, whose hit rock 'n'
roll show "American Bandstand" marked its 50th anniversary in May,
bought Gull's Way as an investment, Westside sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The oceanfront property has been described as "one of the best
building sites in Malibu." It is bordered on three sides by the
ocean.</LD>
<TE>   The property also has a 6,600-square-foot main house, built in the
early '70s, and an 1,800-square-foot guest house, built in 1956. The
main house is habitable but has been neglected. There is also a
caretaker's cottage, beach house and pet cemetery on the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Gull's Way belonged to Pepperdine University before Clark bought
it. The property was given to the school when Luella "Billie" Ulrich
died at age 99 in 1996. She had hoped that the university could build
a conference center on the site, but Pepperdine couldn't get city
approvals.</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich lived on the grounds for more than 50 years, much of it
with her husband, Rick, who died earlier. The couple, who owned
several mobile home parks, bought the site in the '40s and lived
there in a trailer until they built the guest house. When the guest
house was completed, they moved into it until the main house was
built.</TE>
<TE>   The main house, which has a fountain and several murals made with
Malibu tiles, has been used as a set for many movies and such TV
series as "Fantasy Island" (1978-1984). Few weddings have been held
there, but the late Herve Villechaize, who played Tattoo in "Fantasy
Island," was married in front of a fireplace in the house.</TE>
<TE>   The property had been on the market, at $15 million, since June
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the Gull's Way sale will go to the Graziadio School
of Business on the new Drescher campus at Pepperdine in Malibu,
according to public information.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was represented in the sale by Dennis Torres, and the
buyer was represented by Diane Carter of Coldwell Banker, Malibu,
area sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Los Feliz replica of a 17th century villa in Italy, which was a
home during the '20s to movie legend Norma Talmadge, has been sold to
L.A. developer-designer Xorin Balbes for about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Balbes, who recently restored the 1926 Lloyd Wright-designed
Sowden House in Los Feliz, plans to bring back the glamour of Old
Hollywood in the Talmadge villa.</TE>
<TE>   The six-bedroom, 10,000-square-foot house, built in the early
'20s, is a throwback to Hollywood's Golden Age with its 28-foot-high
foyer, Rococo dome fresco ceiling, gold-leaf decorated ballroom and
enormous fireplaces guarded by statues that resemble the MGM lion.</TE>
<TE>   The house also has been the home, at various times, of such
celebrities as Jimi Hendrix and Rod McKuen, and it has been used
extensively for filming. Since a UCLA professor bought the villa at
an auction in 1969, however, it has been used mainly as a book
repository.</TE>
<TE>   Balbes has purchased and renovated 20 homes in the L.A. and
Montecito areas during the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Anne Singer of Coldwell Banker, Hancock Park North,
represented him in buying the villa. Nevianna Christov of DBL Los
Feliz had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ray Cooney, the prolific British playwright-actor-director-produc-
er who wrote such London and international comedy hits as "Run for
Your Wife" and "Wife Begins at 40," and his artist wife, Linda, have
listed their Tarzana home at just under $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple plans to move to Long Island to be near their
screenwriter son, Michael, and his family. Their other son, Daniel,
lives in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The Cooneys built their six-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot Tarzana
house in 1999. The Spanish-style home, overlooking the San Fernando
Valley, has a saltwater pool and spa, two offices, a screening room
and a self-contained apartment. The garage accommodates five cars.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Cooney, one of the most productive and successful modern
British farce writers, also has starred in many plays in London, the
U.S. and Australia. He has directed more than 20 stage productions,
and he has produced 30 West End plays and musicals. Many of his works
have been filmed or televised with him playing the leading roles, as
in the BBC production of "Wife Begins at 40."</TE>
<TE>   His play "Caught in the Net," a sequel to "Run for Your Wife,"
premiered in London and Miami last year.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Duffy of Prudential John Aaroe, Sherman Oaks, and Isobel
Chanin of Sotheby's International Realty, Beverly Hills, have the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Levenson, co-executive producer of the TV series "The
Bachelor" and former producer of "General Hospital," and her husband,
Kenny Rosen, have purchased a Beverly Hills-area home for $720,000.
Rosen, a producer of "The Weakest Link," was a story editor for "Big
Brother 2."</TE>
<TE>   The couple, in their early 30s, became first-time home buyers with
their purchase. The house has three bedrooms and two bathrooms in
slightly more than 1,800 square feet. Built in 1950, the mid-century
modern also has views from most rooms of the grassy yard.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Forster Jones of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills East,
represented the buyers; Irene Tsu of the firm's Beverly Hills North
office had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schafer, who wrote the screenplay for the independent film
"Trick" (1999) and has written numerous episodes of Showtime's
controversial weekly series "Queer as Folk," has listed his
post-and-beam home, built in 1955 in the Hollywood Hills, at
$595,000.</TE>
<TE>   Schafer is moving back to New York, where he lived for six years
after graduating from UCLA. He was born in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by architect Joe Jordan, his house has two bedrooms in
about 1,100 square feet. Schafer restored the original paint colors
and replaced the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   The home still has its original built-ins and a pocket door that
converts a den into a guest room when needed. The fireplace surround
is hand-painted, and the home also has mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Walsh Linder, an architect and real estate broker, and Erik
Lerner--both of Mossler, Deasy &amp; Doe in Beverly Hills--have the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Peerce, a director of such TV series as "Touched by an
Angel" (2001) and the TV movie "Second Honeymoon" (2001), and his
companion, Beth Sommer, have purchased a Wilshire condo for $770,000.</TE>
<TE>   Peerce also directed the hit movie "Goodbye, Columbus" (1969).</TE>
<TE>   The seller was Jeffrey Wong, co-owner of Warning Model Management
in Beverly Hills, which has represented such models as Alessandra
Ambrosio, Eva Herzigova and Kylie Bax. Wong sold his condo because he
bought a Bel-Air home in December for about $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The two-bedroom, 1,900-square-foot condo has mahogany wood floors,
a granite kitchen and fabulous city and mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Moore of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, had the listing;
Beth Sommer of Prime Time Property represented herself and Peerce in
buying.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Bungalow Blues" by Allison B. Cohen, June 9: Another
option would be to remodel that garage, creating an office space
above it that could also include a second or guest bedroom and
bathroom. This would fulfill their goal for a second-story expansion
and entertain their notion of remodeling the garage while
accommodating the city's requirement for the drive-in garage space,
no?</LD>

<TE>   An option was missed for Paul Trautwein's space problem. There are
many low-cost co-op studios in the area [Venice] to which Trautwein
could move his Web business. This would be a more advantageous
situation for him tax-wise and would increase his client base,
offering a more professional location for client meetings.</TE>

<HD>Know Your Rights When Your Building Is Sold</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>H. MAY SPITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"For sale" signs are popping up on properties all over town. What
happens to your tenancy when a property is sold? It depends on what
you've signed and where you live, but one thing is for certain--you
have specific rights, no matter who owns the place you rent.</LD>
<LD>   Some cities have ordinances that regulate owner-occupancy and
payment to tenants who are asked to move out. If you are faced with
an eviction, you may need to consult an attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Start by pulling out your written lease. If you can't find a copy,
you are allowed to ask annually for a copy from your landlord.</LD>
<TE>   If the lease has not expired, the document remains in force. All
terms and conditions still apply.</TE>
<TE>   Your rights run with the property, not the owner or person who
signed the document.</TE>
<TE>   With rare exception, you have the right to remain planted in your
place until the lease period has ended. Negotiations can always take
place, such as buying your lease out so you will depart early, but
you should not feel forced out just because the property has sold.</TE>
<TE>   If the lease has expired, examine the fine print. Most leases have
a clause that creates a month-to-month tenancy when the lease
expires. If so, you may be out of luck--and a home.</TE>
<TE>   Your rights also vary depending on which city you live in, and any
applicable ordinances. Basic research may be required. Check the
front of your phone book under "government" for your specific city,
which lists phone numbers for rent control agencies.</TE>
<TE>   What if no local law applies? In that case, state law prevails.
Usually the owner must give written notice 30 days before the end of
your lease or monthly agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Santa Monica, 60 days' notice
is required. Longer notice periods apply in special circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   What if the new owner wants to move into your place?</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast. Some cities, such as Santa Monica, have highly
detailed regulations. Chapter 9 of its city charter details the
eviction process. The new owner must first specify the number of
bedrooms they need. Location and amenities are not considered unless
the owner documents a medical need.</TE>
<TE>   Once the unit size has been established, the owner must select the
tenant who moved onto the property most recently. Relocation benefits
start at $3,400 for single or bachelor apartments and reach up to
$7,200 for four bedroom units. Benefits are based on the number of
bedrooms in the unit, with additional funds required to be paid to
tenants who are 62 years and older, disabled or those having a minor
(younger than 18) child in residence. The Santa Monica rent-control
board can give further details at (310) 458-8751.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, rent control applies only to certain units
(usually built before 1978). Owners have specific rules to apply when
asking you to move, which are detailed in the ordinance. If asked to
move, tenant compensation is based on occupant age and family
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Couples or singles are given $2,000 to move for the entire unit
(not per person). Seniors and families can receive $5,000 as a
lump-sum parting gift. For Los Angeles, the Rent Registration
Department can be reached at (213) 367-9136.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you may live, what happens to your security deposit when
the place is sold? Do you have to get it back from the previous
owner? Luckily, no. Security deposits are usually transferred to the
new owner as a credit against the purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   How do the new owners know the correct amount? Buyers are always
given a copy of the lease, because they are bound by the agreement.
This includes the security deposit, which remains owed to the tenant.</TE>
<TE>   During escrow, you may be asked to fill out an estoppel
certificate, which has space for your rental amount, any outstanding
problems, costs or claims, and to certify the exact amount of your
security deposit. If your place of residence is sold and you didn't
fill out an estoppel, contact whoever sends the introduction letter
as new owner to review your file. You reap what you sow, so keep a
positive attitude.</TE>

<LD>Anewly renovated 29-unit apartment complex for formerly homeless
residents with mental disabilities opened its doors June 13 in the
Central City West area of downtown Los Angeles, just west of the 110
Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The complex, located close to bus lines and local health services,
was built by A Community of Friends, a nonprofit affordable-housing
development company.</LD>
<LD>   Each studio unit features a private kitchen and bathroom.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to providing permanent housing, the Maryland
Apartments complex offers residents outdoor and indoor recreational
space, a training and computer room, a community patio and garden
area, a case management office and on-site support services to
facilitate independent living skills.</TE>
<TE>   The housing development was funded in part by a loan from City of

<LD>   When painting an exterior door, be certain to seal all six of its
sides.</LD>
<LD>   Exterior doors have a tendency to warp and twist when the weather

<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer used to be the slow season for museum openings and new art
exhibits, but not this year. Some places worth the trip:</LD>
<LD>   * Tacoma, Wash.: On July 6 this city plans to debut an art museum,
a 500-foot-long pedestrian bridge co-designed by glass artist Dale
Chihuly and a public art installation.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece of these ambitious projects is the striking
$48-million Museum of Glass: International Center for Contemporary
Art, featuring a 90-foot-tall, stainless-steel-wrapped cone, along
the Thea Foss Waterway.</LD>
<TE>   Opening exhibits include works by Czechs Stanislav Libensky and
Jaroslava Brychtova; Mark Tobey, Morris Graves and John Cage; and
others. The museum has no permanent collection as yet, and it does
not have works by native son Chihuly. Admission $8 adults. Open daily
except Mondays; hours vary. (253) 296-1768, www.museumofglass.org.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the museum, in its plaza, will be "Water Forest" by Howard
Ben Tre, a large-scale work that uses industrial glass tubing.</TE>
<TE>   The new Bridge of Glass will stretch from the museum's rooftop
across an interstate and train tracks and end in downtown. The
steel-and-glass span, designed by Chihuly and Austin, Texas-based
architect Arthur Andersson, will display several of the artist's
colorful creations.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington, D.C.: "The Quest for Immortality: Treasures of
Ancient Egypt" includes more than 100 objects, plus a full-sized
reconstruction of Pharaoh Thutmose III's burial chamber. Officials
say it is the largest group of antiquities that Egypt has ever loaned
for exhibition in North America. June 30 to Oct. 14. National Gallery
of Art. Free. For information, call (202) 737-4215, www.nga.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago: "Titanic: The New Exhibition" returns to the Museum of
Science and Industry, with artifacts and room re-creations such as
the grand staircase. The exhibit drew more than 850,000 in 2000. July
1 to Oct. 31. Admission $19 adults. (800) 468-6674,
www.msichicago.org.</TE>
<TE>   "Pearls" is about--what else?--the lustrous gems. With more than
600 objects ranging from jewelry to paintings, it is billed as the
largest exhibit ever on the topic. The Field Museum is its second and
final venue; it opened last year in New York. June 28 to Jan. 5.
Admission $14 adults (includes museum admission). (312) 922-9410,
www.fieldmuseum.org.</TE>
<TE>   * New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art puts its full
collection of more than 50 Gauguin artworks on display for the first
time in "Gauguin in New York Collections," running through Oct. 20.
The more than 100 pieces include paintings, sculptures, ceramics and
drawings by the French master. Admission $10 adults. (212) 535-7710,
www.metmuseum.org.</TE>

<TE>   Southwest Eliminating Plastic Boarding Passes</TE>
<TE>   After 30 years, it's the beginning of the end for Southwest
Airlines' distinctive plastic boarding passes.</TE>
<TE>   After a few test runs, the low-fare airline, which doesn't assign
seats, last week began eliminating the numbered passes that group
passengers in order of boarding. Getting to the gate 60 minutes
before flight time, when the passes are distributed, has been a
ritual for Southwest patrons eager to get the low numbers that let
them grab prime seats.</TE>
<TE>   Tightened security procedures since Sept. 11, which require
passengers to carry paper boarding passes with their names, have made
the numbered passes redundant, said Southwest spokeswoman Angela
Vargo.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, passengers no longer have to go to the gate
to get a boarding pass. They can obtain one at the ticket counter or
from a skycap up to 90 minutes before departure. Besides containing
personal identification, the boarding pass will assign them to one of
three boarding groups, so it still pays to get to the airport early.</TE>
<TE>   The airport in Dallas-Fort Worth, where Southwest has its
headquarters, was among the first to end the plastic passes last
week. By the end of this month, Southwest plans to have the new
system in place at all 59 airports it serves, including LAX, Vargo
said.</TE>

<TE>   Cancun Bar Owners Agree to Rein In Revelers</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government is enlisting hoteliers and bar owners in an
effort to crack down on rowdy spring break revelers in Cancun.</TE>
<TE>   Although the resort town last year publicized bans on underage
drinking, open liquor containers in public places and serving
intoxicated patrons, the rules have been widely ignored, Ana Mari
Irabien, spokeswoman for the Cancun Convention and Visitors Bureau,
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   This year more than 50 discos, bars and hotels have signed an
agreement to enforce the rules, including a ban on signs that promote
drinking contests. "If they break the rules, their establishment will
be closed," Irabien said. She said the announcement was made this
month to alert tour operators.</TE>
<TE>   Cancun has traditionally been among the top spring-break
destinations. After peaking at more than 100,000 revelers in 2000,
the numbers dropped to fewer than 50,000 this year, Irabien said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Car Renters Cruise the Internet for Deals</TE>
<TE>   Car renters are flooring it to the Internet to search for deals,
J.D. Power and Associates reports in its annual customer satisfaction
study.</TE>
<TE>   About 36% of vacationers surveyed by the company booked their car
on the Internet this year, compared with 27% last year. Web use by
business renters more than doubled, from 12% to 28%. A major reason
for the change: Rental rates are up 13% or more in some major cities,
driving bookers to the Internet to look for better prices, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tourist Kiosk Opens in Lower Manhattan</TE>
<TE>   A satellite information kiosk for tourists opened last week in
lower Manhattan. The kiosk, at the southern end of City Hall Park on
Broadway at Barclay Street, has staff dispensing maps, brochures,
event listings and directions. It is open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. The
main information center run by New York City's convention and
visitors bureau is in midtown Manhattan, at 810 7th Ave. between 52nd
and 53rd streets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's Notes ...</TE>
<TE>   US Airways is requiring passengers with baggage to check in at
least 30 minutes before flight time and to be at the gate at least 15
minutes before flight time. The previous cutoffs were 20 minutes and
10 minutes. It has also revived an earlier policy of closing aircraft
doors five minutes before the scheduled departure. The airline said
it was making the change to ensure timely flight arrivals. .
.Tourists visiting the Canadian province of Alberta this week may
encounter traffic restrictions in the area, tightened security and
also protests in Calgary because of the G8 Summit of world leaders,
including President Bush, taking place Wednesday and Thursday June
26-27 in Kananaskis, 70 miles from Calgary and 44 miles from Banff,
the State Department says. For updates, visit

<HD>Ensuring a Photo Finish to That Dream Trip</HD>
<DH>Stepped-up luggage inspections threaten to damage
undeveloped film. But there are ways to minimize the risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Freelance photographer Sergio Ortiz of Malibu was returning home from
Russia, carrying about 60 rolls of film he shot there, when the Sept.
11 attacks occurred.</LD>
<LD>   As he passed through newly tightened security checkpoints at
airports in Helsinki, Finland (where his plane was diverted), New
York and San Francisco, he panicked when inspectors refused to
examine his unprocessed film by hand. Instead they made him take it
out of the protective boxes and send it through X-ray machines that
were "cranked way up."</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, 'Good Lord, I'm going to lose 2 1/2 weeks of work,' "
he recalls. But his worry was for naught. "Not one frame was
damaged," Ortiz says.</LD>
<TE>   His experience illustrates the anxiety that stricter airport
security standards are causing even for professionals such as Ortiz,
who has 30 years' experience traveling as a photographer and writer.
No wonder vacationers are confused about how to get their film safely
through the airport.</TE>
<TE>   There's no universal solution because there are many variables:
the speed of the film (Ortiz's use of relatively low-speed ISO 200
film may have saved his work), whether it's in checked or carry-on
baggage and whether it's going through a U.S. or foreign airport.</TE>
<TE>   But the experts offer guidelines on what you can do to safeguard
your film. In general, putting it in checked baggage appears to be
riskiest, followed by sending it through X-ray machines for carry-on
luggage, then by having it hand-checked by inspectors. To be
absolutely safe you can buy and process the film at your destination;
X-rays won't damage developed film. Or you can use a digital camera,
which is not sensitive to X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some options:</TE>
<TE>   Least safe: Placing film in checked baggage. Airport scanners
introduced during the last few years emit high-intensity X-rays
designed to detect explosives in checked baggage. These X-rays may
damage all types of film, according to the International Imaging
Industry Assn., a trade group whose members include Eastman Kodak,
Fuji Photo Film, Konica and Hewlett-Packard.</TE>
<TE>   Although the so-called EDS, or explosives detection system, has
been around awhile, deployment in the U.S. was stepped up after Sept.
11. The federal government wants all airports to have the systems by
January.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 and 1998, two of the imaging association's predecessor
groups ran tests on several models of these scanners using film from
ISO 100 to 1600 and disposable cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The studies found the Examiner 3DX-6000, made by L-3
Communications in New York, fogged all types of film that passed
through it by overexposing it an average of one f-stop and also
caused graininess in the images. The more passes, the more damage.</TE>
<TE>   The CTX-5000SP, made by In- Vision Technologies in Newark, Calif.,
created fogged bands on film rather than fogging the entire film, as
the Examiner did, the study reported. Unlike the Examiner, not all
film was affected, depending on whether it passed only through the
CTX-5000's regular X-rays or was selected for a high-intensity
computer tomography, or CT, scan similar to those used in hospitals.
The CT scan did the only visible damage. It irradiates areas of the
bag that appear suspicious to the human operator or the computer, the
report said. In general, the faster the film, the worse the damage,
the tests found.</TE>
<TE>   The association's advice: "Do not put unprocessed film in your
checked baggage." That includes cameras with film in them, Kodak says
in a useful guide on its Internet site, www.kodak.com.</TE>
<TE>   Safer: Placing film in carry-on luggage. The scanners at airport
security checkpoints in the U.S. emit a lower dose of X-rays than
those used on checked baggage, experts agree. But even these can
damage film under certain circumstances. Foreign airports also may
use different machinery with higher X-ray levels.</TE>
<TE>   There is some debate over the safety level of fast film. "Film
speeds through 1000 are safe," says Mark Laustra, managing director
of aviation business development and strategic accounts for Germany's
Heimann Systems Corp., which makes a widely used scanner. (The
imaging association agrees, as do many airport inspectors.) That
covers most vacationers' film types.</TE>
<TE>   But to be still safer, the imaging association recommends that
even low-speed film be hand-inspected "if subjected to multiple
examinations." On its Web site, Kodak advises that you ask for hand
inspections if your film is ISO 400 or higher or will go through more
than five X-ray exams because damage may be cumulative.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had a problem," says veteran photographer Wolfgang
Kaehler of Bellevue, Wash., who has visited more than a dozen
countries this year. He says he has put film up to ISO 800 through
scanners 20 or 30 times without damage.</TE>
<TE>   Safest: Having film inspected by hand. To avoid X-rays entirely,
get security guards to hand-inspect your film. To speed the process,
use clear canisters or take film out of opaque canisters and put it
into clear plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   This tactic doesn't always work, however. Some foreign airports
don't allow hand inspections. "At Heathrow they always demand to
X-ray," says Santa Barbara photographer Nik Wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S. you are entitled to hand inspections, according to
Federal Aviation Administration rules posted on its Web site,
www.faa.gov/avr/AFS/FARS/far-8.txt. (Scroll down to Sec. 108.17,
under "e.") But even travelers who arrive with the rule in hand are
often being turned down, reports Kodak spokesman Jim Blamphin.</TE>
<TE>   Using protective pouches: Lead-lined bags are marketed to protect
film from X-ray damage. None of the experts I talked to claims the
bags protect all film under all circumstances. Their effectiveness
varies by the lead's thickness, film speed and X-ray strength, Kodak
says.</TE>
<TE>   The imaging association's 1998 test showed that a double thickness
of what it called a "standard lead-lined bag" blocked about
two-thirds of the X-rays emitted by the Examiner checked-baggage
scanner. It took at least four thicknesses to block "almost all"
radiation, it reported. Kodak's Blamphin does not advise using these
pouches in checked baggage.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Ilana Diamond, chief operating officer of Oakmont,
Pa.-based Sima Products Corp., which sells lead-lined bags, about
these results. She acknowledges the bags "do not provide 100%
protection." But she says her company's XPF line, developed after the
1998 test, can protect up to ISO 800 film "with no visible damage"
from checked baggage scanners.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler swears by lead-lined bags. "I've never had any film
damaged through X-rays," he says. Ortiz, on the other hand, says the
only time his film was ruined by X-rays was 10 years ago in
Peru--when he used a lead-lined bag.</TE>

<HD>Peak Season on Chesapeake Bay</HD>
<DH>In summer, MARYLAND'S EASTERN SHORE offers unique
pleasures: sailing on an old skipjack, savoring soft-shell crabs,
paddling the tidelands, relaxing at Colonial-era inns and biking
country byways</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OXFORD, Md.</DL>
<LD>You see them everywhere on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the weekend
sailors. They are unmistakable with their deep tans, their baggy
shorts, their frayed polo shirts, their Top-Siders worn without
socks. Some may not even own their own boats, much less win regattas,
but they are inexorably drawn to the Chesapeake Bay.</LD>
<LD>   It's all about the water here, beginning with the sprawling but
shallow bay, 200 miles long and up to 20 miles wide. Forty or so
rivers flow into it, yielding more places to mess around in boats and
a world of soggy marshes beloved by fishermen, kayakers and birds.
Then there's the convoluted shoreline, 8,000 miles of it meandering
along Maryland and Virginia, where people who don't want to get wet
can gaze hypnotically at the water.</LD>
<LD>   By coincidence, Handel's "Water Music" was playing on the radio
recently as I crossed the Bay Bridge on my way from Washington, D.C.,
to Rock Hall, Md. It's about an hour-and-a-half drive provided you're
not traveling east on a Friday afternoon or west on a Sunday
afternoon, when traffic can be gruesome. I planned to spend four
nights in the bayside hamlets of Rock Hall and Oxford, partly because
this part of the Chesapeake shore is close to Washington, partly
because these villages are Eastern Shore classics: historic, pastoral
and on the water.</LD>
<TE>   Even though the area is a popular getaway spot for weekenders and
my trip was spur of the moment, I was able to snag reservations at
two appealing inns--a Colonial reproduction in Rock Hall and the
genuine article, built in 1700, in Oxford. I planned to spend my days
boating, eating as many Chesapeake Bay blue crabs as possible and
making a little study of Eastern Shore locals.</TE>
<TE>   For city folk like me, they're interesting, even exotic--the
weather-beaten crabbers and oystermen called "watermen,"
gentlemen-farmers and sharecroppers, boat builders, antiques
dealers--all of whom sound like Southerners with mouthfuls of marbles
when they talk. (In some ways Maryland, a slave state that fought on
the Union side during the Civil War, is more southern than history
and geography would suggest.)</TE>
<TE>   Retirees and city people with summer homes have flocked to the
east side of the Chesapeake, making true Eastern Shore natives seem
like a dying breed. Still, locals--above all the watermen who ply the
bay for increasingly scarce crabs and oysters--give these flatlands
their color and prized backwater feeling.</TE>
<TE>   In summer, the Chesapeake Bay sailing set arrives, cousins of New
York yachties who favor Long Island Sound and Bostonians who have
boat slips on Cape Cod. Think of patrician Katharine Hepburn and Cary
Grant in the 1940 movie "The Philadelphia Story," reminiscing about
their old yacht. "My, she was yar," Hepburn says.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking boats of their own, tourists get out on the water however
they can or simply sample the pleasures of country life. They bike
with picnic baskets, crack open steamed crabs in dockside restaurants
and stay in graceful bed-and-breakfast inns that smell of boxwood and
furniture polish.</TE>
<TE>   One of the country pleasures I enjoyed on the way from Rock Hall
to the Inn at Osprey Point, where I had reserved a room for two
nights, was being stopped by a policewoman for going 39 mph in a
30-mph zone. "You better slow your butt down," she said, and then
gave me a warning, not a ticket. Later, a woman in a Rock Hall marina
shop commiserated with me about the incident. "We don't have much to
do around here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That's Rock Hall. The town sits near the mouth of the Chester
River, just north of the Eastern Neck Island National Wildlife
Refuge. It's sleepier and scruffier than other Eastern Shore havens,
such as chic St. Michaels, and it has but one traffic light, a tiny
business district, a grocery store, a rusty water tower, modest
working-class homes with a surprising array of lawn ornaments, a cafe
that opens at 4 a.m. (presumably for fishermen), half a dozen or so
marinas and water on three sides.</TE>
<TE>   I explored the marinas, such as Spring Cove, where there's a
sailing school, and Haven Harbour, where a sailing shop called the
Ditty Bag sells everything from Boat Zoap Plus to fast-dissolving
toilet paper. The shop also keeps the key to the minuscule Waterman's
Museum next door, where I learned that "peelers" are soft-shell crabs
(harvested during molting season, from May till early fall, after
they've shed their hard shells and can be eaten whole), and that
once-abundant Chesapeake Bay oysters succumbed to parasites around
the turn of the last century. Small as it is, the museum beguiles,
especially the re-creation of one of the portable shanties used for
shelter by watermen in winter. The exhibit had a mannequin waterman
sleeping in a bunk and a plate of biscuits on the table.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Inn at Osprey Point, just down the road from Haven Harbor, is
a beige three-story Colonial, a copy of the 18th century Coke-Garrett
House in Virginia's Colonial Williamsburg. My room on the second
floor had the elegant, spare look of the Revolutionary War era:
burnished wood floors covered with Oriental rugs, white walls with
green trim, pictures of sailing ships and three windows overlooking
the water. The owners are a group of Philadelphia businessmen, so the
place doesn't feel as homey as B&amp;Bs that have on-site owners, but
it's a popular spot for weddings. It has a handsome restaurant (with
undistinguished food, alas), a pool, bikes, whirlpool tubs and views
of Osprey Point Marina, where a family of swans cruises and sailboats
with names like Anywhere, Procrastinator and Hornpipe are moored.</TE>
<TE>   At breakfast I got to talking with Jerry Messina, one of the inn's
owners, who was there for a meeting. While the staff prepared for yet
another wedding weekend, I kiddingly asked him if he was the groom.
He almost jumped out of his Top-Siders, apparently gunshy when it
comes to matrimony. He's a lawyer in Philly who owns a good bit of
property in Rock Hall and, as a past winner of the bay's vaunted
Huntingfield Cup regatta, clearly knows his way around a boat.</TE>
<TE>   Besides sailing, there are plenty of ways to enjoy the Rock Hall
area, on and off the water. I took a kayaking tour with a company
that also sells rowing shells. The sky was stormy, but owner Tom
McGlinn said that "the man"--the TV weatherman, in Eastern Shore
vernacular--was predicting it would soon blow over. My guide, Dean
Ramon Gardels, and I pushed off from Skinners Neck boat ramp and
tootled around Grays Inn Creek watching for great blue herons and
ospreys while the ambivalent current changed with each new gust of
wind.</TE>
<TE>   Another day, I biked about eight miles from Rock Hall to Eastern
Neck Island National Wildlife Refuge, an easy trip because the
Eastern Shore is so flat. On the way, I passed through a verdant
countryside of farm fields, swamplands and stands of spindly loblolly
pine.</TE>
<TE>   A bend in the two-lane highway, Maryland 445, took me past
Trumpington Manor (part of a 1658 English land grant), then over a
wooden bridge where a man was fishing for white perch. The wildlife
refuge is a popular spot for bird-watchers, but at the visitors
center near land's end, instead I saw butterflies flitting above
allergy-inducing fields of ragweed and Queen Anne's lace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aimlessly driving country roads is another favorite Eastern Shore
pastime. From Rock Hall I followed Maryland 20 about 15 miles
northeast to Chestertown, one of the most historic villages in the
region and to my mind the prettiest. Distinguished old mansions line
the Chester River there, with lawns sloping gently to the banks. In
town, the roots of old trees buckle the brick sidewalks, attorneys'
offices still line 19th century Lawyer's Row and the knowledgeable
clerk in the Compleat Bookseller on High Street wears a bow tie, as
he should.</TE>
<TE>   Then I shunpiked north to Hopkins Game Farm near little
Kennedyville, where practice rounds for the Great American Sporting
Clay Championship were underway and I could hardly tear myself away
from a wire cage containing five black Labrador retriever puppies for
sale. Munching a soft-shell crab sandwich from the concession stand,
I watched contestants shoulder their guns and call "pull." At that,
bright orange disks were released into the sky, followed by a racket
of gunshot and a shower of clay pigeon shards.</TE>
<TE>   About a 15-minute drive northeast of there I found Dixon's
Furniture in the hamlet of Crumpton. The big green garage at the
corner of highways 544 and 290 is known for its Wednesday auctions,
attended by locals, tourists and serious antiques dealers. I started
with a hot dog in a delicious soft pretzel bun served by one of the
Amish folk who run the snack shops, then had a hand-dipped ice cream
cone while perusing the homemade canned goods for sale--peaches,
pickled watermelon rind, chowchow (pickled vegetables)--and a bizarre
collection of items up for auction. The auctioneer went from table to
table, selling mostly bric-a-brac. A stuffed fox went for $30 (as the
proud owner took it away, its tail fell off), and the bidding heated
up over a set of six blue oyster plates that eventually sold for
$375.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the day, the sky blackened and dangerous-looking
clouds pushed in from the bay. I was on a country road when it
started to rain and hail, so I pulled over to watch the show. On the
radio I heard that tornadoes had been sighted and, later, that high
winds had blown over the 460-year-old Wye Oak, an Eastern Shore
landmark about 20 miles east of the Bay Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The storm left behind a soft, pearly sunset, which I enjoyed from
the deck at Waterman's Crab House in Rock Hall. Like the Crab Claw in
St. Michaels and Pier Street Restaurant in Oxford, Waterman's is a
casual waterfront place with picnic tables. Steamed blue crabs are
served on brown paper, not plates, and wooden mallets are provided
for busting open the shells. Extracting the meat is a messy business
but more fun than a food fight. Nevertheless, that night I had the
easier-to-handle crab cakes, filled with huge, succulent lumps.</TE>
<TE>   To find out how the shellfish delicacy is harvested, I moved south
to Oxford, about a 45-minute drive east of Tilghman Island, where I'd
arranged to go crabbing on the Miss Kim, a motorboat out of Dogwood
Harbor. Capt. Wade H. Murphy Jr., who has worked on the bay for 45
years, told me to get there at 5:30 a.m. The four-hour trip costs
$30, or $60 with a bushel of crabs, if we caught them.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Wade is a spry, sunburned showman of about 60 who can steer
a boat, net crabs and eat a banana at the same time. From a family of
bona fide watermen going back three generations, he claimed to have
once taken 78 bushels of blue crabs out of the Chesapeake in a day.
Of late, though, he's found catering to tourists more lucrative. On
this trip there were four of us, me and three ministers from Ohio,
who would come east to attend sailing school in Annapolis.</TE>
<TE>   On our way out of the harbor, the captain explained how crabs
reproduce, told jokes and denounced the state of Maryland for its
conservation policies, which he believes have done little to increase
the dwindling number of oysters and crabs in the bay. Then he laid
out a fishing line half a mile long, called a trotline, baited with
chicken necks. As he began reeling it in, he used a long-handled net
to scoop up the crabs that had latched onto the chicken parts,
dumping them into a bushel basket. We all got a chance to try, while
Wade encouraged and harangued. If we missed one, he fumed like a
Little League dad, "You didn't go deep enough." In the end, we got
only one bushel, which the ministers planned to cook at a nearby
park.</TE>
<TE>   Later I went out on the bay again with the captain in the Rebecca
T. Ruark, the oldest oyster-dredging sailboat left on the Chesapeake.
Only about a dozen of these handsome, high-masted vessels, known as
skipjacks, still work the bay, which has earned them recognition from
the National Trust for Historic Preservation. At the Chesapeake Bay
Maritime Museum in nearby St. Michaels, a vintage skipjack called the
Lady Katie is being restored.</TE>
<TE>   Wade is justifiably proud of the Rebecca. Built in 1886, it is
truly yar, accommodating about 15 passengers who help raise the
sails. They squeak and groan as they're hoisted, hang limp for a
minute, then catch the breeze and billow. A majestic sight, though
mostly I loved the two-hour trip because I had forgotten how clean
and healthy sailing makes me feel.</TE>
<TE>   East of Tilghman Island, in St. Michaels, I had oysters on the
half-shell at the Crab Claw, apparently a required stop for all
tourists but lacking the down-home atmosphere of Waterman's in Rock
Hall. I also visited the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum (a complex of
boats and buildings at Navy Point) and spent a little time in the
town's touristy shops. Bellevue Road is the scenic route from there
to Oxford, crossing the wide Tred Avon River on the Oxford-Bellevue
ferry, established in 1683. It lets you off at the doorstep of the
venerable Robert Morris Inn, with a Colonial-style restaurant and tap
room.</TE>
<TE>   Oxford is leafy, quiet and lovely, the sort of place where couples
get engaged. It's full of marinas, boat stores and 18th and 19th
century buildings, of which the yellow Robert Morris Inn, founded
about 1700, is the crown jewel.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed in one of the inn's summer cottages, with waist-high
wainscoting, a step-up king bed, a screened porch overlooking the
water and a polished white clawfoot tub in which I took bubble baths
as often as I could. Or I occupied an Adirondack chair on the lawn,
watching sailboats come and go, wondering precisely why we're
magnetically drawn to the water.</TE>
<TE>   It was a deep riddle, I decided, that would no doubt require many
more visits to the Eastern Shore to solve.</TE>

<DH>After a dash from Paris to Provence, the pace slows on a
narrow-gauge jog into the hills</DH>

<BD>Karl Zimmermann, author of numerous books about trains,
is a freelance writer in Norwood, N.J.</BD>
<DL>MEAILLES, France</DL>
<LD>On a recent rail trek through France, I rode with Aesop figuratively
at my elbow--though in this case his hare and tortoise were not
competitive but complementary, with one taking me to the other.</LD>
<LD>   The hare was the much-admired TGV, or Train a Grande
Vitesse--"high-speed train," and the world's most prominent one at
that. The tortoise was a modest railcar of the narrow-gauge Chemins
de Fer de Provence, a homey little line that climbs from the southern
resort city of Nice on France's Riviera to Digne-les-Bains, in the
Provencal Alps.</LD>
<LD>   High in those mountains, Meailles, a remote, deserted and
windblown depot, was the ultima Thule of my journey--about as far in
style and spirit as you can get from the modern station at Paris'
Charles de Gaulle Airport, where our trip had begun last March.</LD>
<TE>   As an American used to exiting airports on traffic-choked
highways, I'm exhilarated every time I fly into a European city and
find I can trundle my luggage cart from baggage claim right to the
platform of a train heading my way. From Charles de Gaulle's bright,
airy station, my wife, Laurel, and I stepped aboard a sleek
blue-and-silver TGV, settled into our first-class seats and sped to
Marseille over the TGV Mediterranee line, which began service in June
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Since its first route opened two decades ago, the TGV has
epitomized high-speed railroading, a healthy contagion that has
spread throughout Western Europe as Germany fielded its ICE, Belgium
its Thalys, Italy and Switzerland their Cisalpino, Sweden its X2000
and Spain its AVE. But the TGV remains the fastest, reaching speeds
of 186 mph over long stretches of dedicated fast track. France's
932-mile network of high-speed lines is the world's most extensive.</TE>
<TE>   And it keeps expanding, most recently with the 156-mile "TGV Med"
from Valence to Marseille. The Med's completion has cut travel time
from Paris' Gare de Lyon to Marseille to three hours flat, trimming 1
1/4 hours off the previous best. To my mind, the TGV is the best way
to travel to southern France; by car, the 550-mile trip would take
about seven hours.</TE>
<TE>   The train was heavily booked, so we were glad we had reserved our
seats in the States through Rail Europe--though we had paid $11 each
for this convenience. (Reservations, always required on TGVs, cost
about $1.50 apiece when booked in France.) Seating in first class is
two and one across, lending a spacious feel. And legroom is generous.
But it's best not to travel at mealtimes because the cafe car offers
only rudimentary service for beverages, sandwiches and snacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Launched from Charles de Gaulle, we bypassed Paris, stopping only
at Marne la Vallee-Chessy (for Disneyland Paris) on the way to Lyon.
We sped through rolling countryside--cultivated fields and pastures
dotted with sheep and cows. When we met Paris-bound TGVs, they
snapped past in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   As we entered Lyon, the train switched to conventional track,
dropping down from a hill that offered expansive views of the city.
The platforms here were busy with TGVs and conventional trains--a
reminder of a central tenet of the TGV concept: Build dedicated
high-speed lines where practical, and use upgraded conventional
tracks where not, particularly in and out of cities.</TE>
<TE>   Racing south again, we spotted snowcapped mountains in the eastern
distance. Before long we were on the new TGV Med line, crossing the
graceful concrete trestles for which it's known. The Med required
nearly 500 new structures, seven of which have been noted by the
French government as "Monuments d'Art."</TE>
<TE>   Three new TGV-dedicated stations--called gares de soleil, or
"stations of sun," for their use of glass--were built at Valence,
Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. All this, along with the extraordinary
environmental sensitivity required in the line's construction, helps
explain why it took 12 years and $3.5 billion to construct.</TE>
<TE>   The Monuments d'Art blew by in a blur, I have to admit, which was
reinforced by jet-lag-induced naps. Laurel and I agreed that speeding
south on a TGV was the perfect way to recover from the rigors of a
transatlantic flight.</TE>
<TE>   We entered the once-gritty port city of Marseille through a new
3.4-mile-long tunnel, the longest in France. The 550-mile run from
Charles de Gaulle had taken the scheduled three hours and 35 minutes.
After a short taxi ride we were standing on our balcony at the
comfortable Hotel Residence du Vieux Port, watching the afternoon sun
die among the sailboat masts that bristled in the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marseille was a revelation. A decade ago it would have been on few
tourist itineraries. Although the city retains a bracingly
blue-collar feel, the steep, narrow, winding streets of "Le Panier,"
or Old Town, and the many fine seafood restaurants that cluster
around the old port are a tourist draw--yet it struck us that more of
our fellow visitors spoke French than English.</TE>
<TE>   From Marseille we headed east along the Mediterranean coast to
Nice, long a Cote d'Azur tourist mecca--but this time over
conventional tracks, with numerous stops, so the 140-mile run took
two hours and 25 minutes. For the first half of the trip the tracks
looped inland, but from St.-Raphael to Cannes and Antibes they clung
to the coast. We glided by broad beaches, towering cliffs and rocky
crags that fractured the surf into geysers. We saw acres of marinas.</TE>
<TE>   In Nice we settled into the wonderful Hotel Windsor, comfortable,
stylish, hip--yet affordable, even for the spacious room we chose,
with a balcony overlooking the garden. We had cocktails in the cozy
corner bar and were back there the next morning for an excellent
breakfast. The Windsor is only three blocks from the broad Promenade
des Anglais and the sea. It's also within walking distance of the
station for the 94-mile-long Chemins de Fer de Provence, or CP.</TE>
<TE>   While Laurel chose to stay behind to visit Nice's flower market
and stroll the promenade, I walked to the CP station for a day trip.</TE>
<TE>   The CP is known as the "Train des Pignes," or "Pine Cone Train,"
for reasons that are now obscure. One theory has some credibility
with those who have ridden on the line: The train is so slow that
passengers could get off and collect pine cones along the way without
delaying it. My 60-mile trip to Meailles would take two hours and
nine minutes, at an average speed of 28 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The cars of the Chemins de Fer de Provence are humble but
comfortable, with broad windows and high-backed plush seats. On my
outbound journey toward Digne-les-Bains, I could see out the
windshield from the front row of passenger seats, a great vantage for
watching the meter-gauge tracks find their way into the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Standard-gauge rails are 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches apart; meter-gauge
rails are narrower, about 3 feet, 3 1/2 inches, lending a fetching
air of diminution to the whole enterprise. Narrow-gauge railways were
typically built in remote locations where topography presented
operating challenges. The wilder the terrain, the greater the
economy--and economy was of the essence on these lightly traveled
lines, since tunnels, cuts and mountainside ledges can be smaller
with narrow-gauge track. Grades can be steeper and curves sharper.</TE>
<TE>   Grades, curves, ledges, cuts and tunnels all awaited me when I
boarded the 12:43 p.m. train from the CP station at Nice. The car
coughed to life a few moments before departure, then whined into
motion. After a few minutes of defying auto traffic on Nice's busy
streets, we burst into exurbia and began to roll. At St.-Sauveur we
joined up with the Var, the river that would provide a path for the
railway for much of its climb into the Alps of Haute Provence.</TE>
<TE>   Colmars-La Manda, eight miles from downtown, is the farthest reach
of the CP's local service. A pair of plexiglass sheds serves as the
station. After that, as the scenery began to improve so did the
architecture of the stations: charming stucco structures, with
patterned brick at the corners, that are typical of Provence.</TE>
<TE>   The number "1891" cast into a tunnel portal just beyond La Tinee
gave me a clue to the line's history. This first stretch, as far as
Mezel, opened in 1891; the additional miles to Puget-Theniers were
added the following year. But it took two more decades for the
railroad to be completed to Digne.</TE>
<TE>   At La Tinee I spotted a water tank and other decaying remnants of
steam railroading--which, happily, is not entirely a thing of the
past on the CP. On most Sundays May through July, and occasional ones
August through October, a 1907-built locomotive a vapeur operates
from Puget-Theniers to Annot, hauling coaches with varnished wood
interiors that date to 1892.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the little car reached Puget-Theniers, a magnet for
visitors, we had jogged and swayed for 36 miles from Nice, climbing
from near sea level to 1,335 feet. By Meailles, 19 miles farther, we
would climb another 1,772 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The final climb from Le Fugeret was the piece de resistance--358
feet in less than three miles. The journey required a pair of tight
loops, a tunnel and a 397-foot-long viaduct. From the upper levels I
looked down on a zigzagging line that seemed to belong on a Lionel
toy train layout. Here was the essence of narrow-gauge
railroading--difficult and remote, with man's frail contrivances
seemingly overmatched by soaring nature.</TE>
<TE>   At the deserted depot at Meailles, 90 years old and beginning to
show it, I sat on a bench in the sun. The wind whistled, but all else
was silent. It was lonely, bordering on spooky, so I was happy when,
after less than 20 minutes, and just as the timetable had promised,
the headlights of the return car appeared. I was ready to put back
the layers of civilization that had peeled away on the climb.</TE>

<HD>Digging the Scene at an Arizona Ranch</HD>

<AU>KARIN KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The sun baked our hats and seemed to burn through our sunscreen as we
knelt in the dirt scraping away at the compacted soil. I could sense
Sam's thought: "Mom took me on vacation for this?"</LD>
<LD>   Archeology has been my semi- secret passion since I was 11, Sam's
age, and swooned over "The Source," by James Michener. But aside from
occasional weekend stints at generally unrewarding local digs, this
would-be Indiana Jones had been stymied. Volunteering at most digs
requires a hefty time commitment and is often expensive. Digs that
allow kids are virtually nonexistent.</LD>
<LD>   One exception: the X Diamond &amp; MLY Ranch in the White Mountains of
Arizona. A working cattle and dude ranch, it also has a stone-walled
Native American house dating back more than 1,000 years. Guests are
welcome to join the dig for a day, or even just part of one, no
experience required--and kids are welcomed. As it turned out, this
little archeologist-for-a-day experiment, combined with horseback
riding in Apache National Forest and fly-fishing in a nearby river,
made the long trip to the ranch worth the effort.</LD>
<TE>   Early on the Friday before Memorial Day, Sam and I flew off for
our mother-son adventure to the 100-degree heat of Phoenix, leaving
my husband home with the girls for four days. (The preschooler would
have broken all the pottery shards into even tinier pieces, and the
teenager is mainly interested in what she can dig up at Banana
Republic.)</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is near the Apache and Navajo reservations, a few miles
from the New Mexico border. This meant a 230-mile drive from Phoenix,
much of it scenic and some of it breathtaking. Even Sam, not given to
cooing over scenery, was agape at the outcrops of rock and dramatic
drops of Salt River Canyon, about halfway through the drive. The
ranch sits at an elevation of more than 7,000 feet in a region
usually at least 15 degrees cooler than Phoenix; average highs are in
the mid-80s, even in summer.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped for kitchen provisions in Springerville, then drove
about 10 miles farther to the ranch, spotting occasional antelope
bounding through the meadows. Rubes that we are, we didn't realize
that you don't check in at the X Diamond ranch house. You just stop
along the road at your cabin. The doors are unlocked. The keys, which
few people seem to use, are on the table.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The ranch, along the Little Colorado River, is still owned by the
descendants of its 1879 founders, and it still raises cattle. It
turned dude ranch about 10 years ago, though that aspect is
understated. The X Diamond has only seven units, most of them
recently built log cabins secluded along the road. All have full
kitchens--practically a necessity because the nearest restaurant is
back in Springerville. Prices range from $48 to $175 a night,
depending on the season and accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   Sam and I were in the Phobe, a $95-a-night renovated 1890s log
cabin named after its first resident. The Phobe is a homey little
place, each room a slightly different age, it would seem. Board games
are stacked in a cabinet, and big windows overlook a meadow and
canyon wall. The river is down there, too, hidden by shrubbery. Sam
fell in love with the sleeping porch and immediately tried out the
climbing tree in the sideyard. The cabin is one of the few with a
phone and TV. It also has a master bedroom, a paneled living room, an
eat-in kitchen--and no other buildings in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Achy from sitting all day, we hiked until dinnertime. Sam
befriended the ranch dogs and horses, and we came across a couple of
beaver dams along the river. I wasn't up for cooking, so we drove to
another nearby town, Greer, and ate at the Rendezvous Diner, where it
took a long time to get a meal (no one seemed to mind) but the chili
was good.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was to be our big adventure. After breakfast overlooking
what I soon thought of as our personal meadow, we headed to the ranch
house to meet Charles Rand, the site archeologist. Rand is a
passionate amateur, a former youth counselor from San Francisco who
retired to this area to learn about and pursue Native American digs.
For no pay, he works the so-called Little Bear site at the ranch,
aiming to restore the 25-room house. He has a long way to go. Just a
few of the rooms have undergone significant excavation.</TE>
<TE>   The word "house" can be misleading when it comes to ancient ruins.
The main sign that people lived here are the rocks found scattered in
mounded lines, roughly delineating the rooms. Uncovering the walls
means digging several feet down.</TE>
<TE>   Rand handed us buckets, each containing a kneepad, a trowel, a
dustpan and brushes. Experience had taught me to bring shade hats,
gardening or work gloves, cold water and sunscreen. Neckerchiefs are
a good idea, too--one soaked with cold water and kept around the neck
or on top of the head.</TE>
<TE>   We got a short lesson first: The site, Rand said, dates from AD
600 to 900 and was inhabited for a time by people he identified as
ancestors of the Hopi and Zuni.</TE>
<TE>   Then we were put to work, each assigned a section of earth about a
yard square for digging in the house's "Room 10." We used the trowels
to scrape hardened soil into dustpans, and from there into our
buckets. Once the bucket was about a third full, we dumped the
contents into framed screens, which sifted out the earth. The
remaining lumps were examined to sort stones from bits of clay
pottery, or perhaps tools or beads. Finds went into a plastic bag
labeled with the grid number and the depth we worked.</TE>
<TE>   The dirt was laden with finds, mostly pottery shards, all of which
must stay at the ranch. Many were painted with striking patterns of
black on white or reddish backgrounds; a few pieces showed fine black
lines just millimeters apart, tiny bits of artistic wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Rand loves to be asked about the site and about the time he spent
living with the Hopi and learning their language. He talked about the
abundance of pottery filling these rooms and shared theories about
the many ancient sites in Arizona and New Mexico that were suddenly
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Romance aside, this is hot, dirty, repetitious work. Despite our
initial thrill at touching the handiwork of people who worked and
worshiped right here more than 1,000 years ago, Sam and I eventually
tired of scraping, filling and screening. So after a few hours, as
the sun climbed overhead, we went back to the ranch house, where we
were given a bag lunch. (The ranch charges $40 plus tax for an adult
dig, lunch included; kids under 12 are free.)</TE>
<TE>   We took our finds to a barn that doubles as Rand's lab, washed
them with toothbrushes, sorted and labeled them, and filed them away
in drying racks.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't have time to rest before our 4 p.m. trail ride. I picked
the "Tenderfoot," an hour ride that costs $25 per person. Choices
extend up to daylong rides with lunch for $125; some let you do
cowboy work for a half or full day.</TE>
<TE>   We followed a trail that went up into ponderosa pines, part of
Apache National Forest above the ranch. The air was so clean and
lightly scented by the woods, it was a pleasure just to inhale
deeply. An outgoing guide used the word "cowboy" as a verb ("My dad
cowboyed all up and down this canyon"), called little girls "Sis,"
regaled us with the land's history (Geronimo and the Clanton gang hid
out in this forest) and told us of current concerns about a
developer's plans to build on nearby state land.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the ride, my "Tenderfoot" knees were killing me. We
staggered off to the Phobe and cooked dinner. Sam was so filthy he
actually offered to take a bath, and we fell asleep to the sound of
the river rushing through "our" meadow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's fly-fishing along the river, and the ranch offers lessons
and equipment rentals. But that was too sophisticated for Sam, who on
Sunday morning wanted to drop a line in the water. The ranch owner,
who didn't know I was writing a travel article, loaned him an old rod
and wouldn't accept a rental fee. All we needed was bait and tackle,
which we picked up in Springerville.</TE>
<TE>   Sam got a nibble, but the fish got away with the worm, and after a
couple of troutless hours, we were ready for something different.</TE>
<TE>   We found it at Casa Malpais, an 800-year-old stone ruin in
Springerville. With its astronomical observatory, underground burials
and spectacular cave petroglyphs, it's an extraordinary site, one
considered sacred to its former residents as well as to modern Hopi
and Zuni. Its best spots are mostly off-limits on the 1 1/2-mile
tour. But the trip is worth it just for the observatory, a low,
circular wall with doorways, petroglyphs and other markers that align
with the rising and setting sun of the solstices and equinoxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Phobe wasn't available for our last night; I knew that when I
made the reservations. But the ranch gave us its most expensive
cabin, the $175-a-night Fisherman, at a reduced price. It was
spectacular, with a vast great room overlooking the beaver dams, and
two large bedrooms, each with an elegant adjoining bath.</TE>
<TE>   Sam was dying to ride a horse again, though we had to leave early
Monday. Kym Johnson, the stable manager and a lifelong ranch
resident, offered to take him out first thing in the morning. So at 7
a.m., the pair took off along a different trail that rose to nearby
petroglyphs. I threw our bags in the car and settled in our cabin
with coffee to watch the river. In its own nook among the hills, the
ranch felt like a self-contained world; though we had only been here
a few days, Southern California seemed like a place where I had lived
long ago. Then Kym delivered Sam, still on horseback, to the cabin
door.</TE>

<HD>Getting a New View of Native Lands</HD>
<DH>A Ute guide anchors a raft trip on the Green filled with
wildlife and wonders</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER AIKEN</AU>
<BD>Peter Aiken is a freelance writer living in Nantucket,
Mass.</BD>
<DL>FORT DUCHESNE, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was my fourth night on Utah's Green River, and I was in a deep,
exhausted sleep. One clearly spoken sentence jolted me awake: "Peter,
there's a bear behind your tent."</LD>
<LD>   I jumped out in my boxers with flashlight in hand. The bear was
just across a shallow stream leading to the main river, and it rose
up on a rock overlooking camp. In the dim moonlight, the beast's
phosphorescent eyes stood out like beacons in the glow of my
flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   At the beginning of the trip I had asked Rick Chapoose, my Ute
Indian rafting guide, what he did when bears came into his camp. "I
just tell them to go away," he had said in his soft Western accent. I
wondered at the time whether this was some dream catcher-Father
Earth-gentle steward gibberish.</LD>
<TE>   But there was Rick, cigarette in one hand and flashlight in the
other, looking at the bear and saying, "Go 'way!"</TE>
<TE>   The bear stayed put. I calculated it could cross the stream, climb
the bank and be all over me in 2 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While Rick talked to the bear, I picked up the biggest pot I could
find and banged on it with a large spoon. I didn't stop until the
glowing eyes slipped back into the dark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Green River enters Utah south of the Wyoming border at Flaming
Gorge and flows along the eastern side of the state until it joins
the Colorado River in Canyonlands National Park, 100 miles north of
the Navajo reservation. In this wild country, the river cuts through
massive amphitheaters of stone that can take a man's loud cry and
wrap its echoes around a canyon bend. In the heat of midday nothing
moves but the river and fat catfish rising to its surface.</TE>
<TE>   A last-minute family cancellation for this August trip two summers
ago limited our group to Rick, his partner Debbie Ducey, two mixed
Labs named Lucky and Little Bear, and me. Rick supplied the rafting
expertise, Debbie the organization, and the dogs the early warning
system.</TE>
<TE>   I love adventure travel and reading about Native Americans, and my
teaching experience in the Peace Corps in Samoa and Thailand
heightened my enjoyment of and desire for cross-cultural experiences.</TE>
<TE>   So when I saw the small ad in the back of a Men's Journal magazine
for a rafting trip on the Green River with a Native American guide, I
was intrigued. I could study the river system as well as the people
who had lived around it for centuries with the help of Rick, a
full-blood Northern Ute, the people for whom the state was named.</TE>
<TE>   There are other rafting outfitters on the Green, of course, but I
chose Rick's company because of the intimacy of the group and his
depth of knowledge and experience. Rick specializes in small
groups--10 or fewer--including families with kids as young as 5. He
teaches the history of and gives information on the flora and fauna
of the section of river that explorer John Wesley Powell named
Desolation Canyon in 1869.</TE>
<TE>   Rick's roots run deep here; he has been rafting people down the
Green for years, as did his father before him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We put in at the ranger station called Sand Wash, a former ferry
crossing for cowboys that's down 25 miles of bad road from Fort
Duchesne. Near the end of the road was a narrow canyon with a flat
mesa looking down on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect place here for an Indian ambush," I said to Rick.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," he said. "I wanted to put a line of Utes on horses up
there all colored up in war paint for the tourists."</TE>
<TE>   From Sand Wash we would float 90 miles south on this meandering
river to the town of Green River. You won't see a single active
settlement on either bank along this stretch. In fact, three-quarters
of the length of the river's east bank is Northern Ute reservation,
off-limits to non-Indians. Ten miles from Sand Wash, the river enters
Desolation Canyon, where surrounding peaks start at 5,000 feet and
rise to more than 8,000 in the heart of the canyon. Cell phones don't
work, and speedboats and motorized personal watercraft aren't
allowed. There are no shops for food or drink.</TE>
<TE>   But there are terrific stops along the way. Indian petroglyphs,
1,000 years old, are only a few minutes' walk from the river at Flat
Canyon Rapid, two miles south of Cedar Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   An abandoned moonshiner's shack is squeezed into a cave along one
slope of Firewater Canyon. We saw two abandoned ranch sites, complete
with sheds, ranch house remains, fenced-in corrals, irrigation
ditches and fruit trees picked clean by wildlife. There are bubbling
cold springs in tree-covered glades for cooling off in, and riverbank
beaches wide and clean except for whitened animal bones.</TE>
<TE>   Wild horses graze on the hillsides, and wild cattle, possibly
survivors from the failed ranches, gather at the river in the morning
to drink. Wildlife abounds. We saw black bear (twice), beaver,
white-tailed prairie dogs, jack rabbit, huge catfish, pronghorn
antelope, marmot, eagle and Rocky Mountain goat. We spotted cougar
tracks and beaver sand slides, formed when the rodents slip down into
the river from clumps of foliage and leave a neat groove. We got a
whiff of skunk, which stayed out of view.</TE>
<TE>   The Green River has Class 1 to 3 rapids, mild to moderate, with
waves high enough for a dousing but not high enough to be
life-threatening. Anyone can make this trip, really. For some, it's
not so much the ferocity of the white water as the isolation from
modern civilization that may be the deciding factor.</TE>
<TE>   Green River rapids aren't as powerful as those of the Colorado as
it sluices through the Grand Canyon, but the sparse population in the
Utah hinterlands means the land through which the Green flows,
overseen by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land
Management, is well preserved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you've read about the mountain men of the Old West, you've read
about the Green; it was prime beaver habitat and the source for pelts
bartered at yearly rendezvous in the 1830s along its northern branch
in Wyoming. Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch also knew the Green.
It's part of the Outlaw Trail that ran from New Mexico through Utah
to Hole-in-the-Wall, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   For a party of 10, Chapoose Canyon Adventures prepares two 18-foot
Rikens, oar-rigged rafts that hold lots of food and equipment, and
enough two-man rubber kayaks, called duckies, to accommodate those
who prefer self-propulsion. There's also at least one "swamper" to
help with camp setup and cooking. Besides making and breaking
camp--the hard work of unloading, setting up the kitchen, cooking,
dishwashing, reloading and securing--outfitters set up the "groover,"
or portable toilet, mandatory on the Green. Rangers check for these
and other items such as life vests and first-aid kits at the Sand
Wash put-in.</TE>
<TE>   Our small party tackled the river in one Riken, in which Rick
navigated with gear and dogs, and in a ducky, which I shared with
Debbie for most of the river and all of the rapids.</TE>
<TE>   The rapids on the Green change with the season. In spring the
force of the water is greatest and the ride the fastest. But later in
the season, as water levels recede, rapids may switch from one bank
of the river to the middle or the opposite bank. Some of the better
white water is at Rock Creek Rapid, where the ghost ranch of the same
name spreads out; Joe Hutch Rapid, which shoots raft bows toward the
sky; and Wire Fence Rapid, which curves and forces boats into a
central washing machine-like current that peters out at a magnificent
white sand beach.</TE>
<TE>   The campsites were as memorable to me as the rapids. The rapids
could be navigated in five minutes, but the nights seemed to go on
forever. The crickets were so loud the first night at Sand Wash that
I tossed and turned. It was only over coffee the next morning that
Rick said he heard me snoring. I must have slept--but I didn't feel
as though I had.</TE>
<TE>   The second night was relatively quiet, and the fourth night was
the bear.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Night 3.</TE>
<TE>   Around Mile 50, the skies clouded over and the wind picked up. We
set up camp early just below the abandoned Rock Creek Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   After helping unload, I set up my tent while supper was prepared,
choosing a flat spot between sagebrush bushes. It was fairly open
country with paths leading to a canyon and north to the ranch. But
the wind made cooking impractical, so we had a snack and retired just
as the rain began to patter.</TE>
<TE>   It was just getting dark when the storm hit with fury. Thunder
boomed, and lightning illuminated the valley. With a fierce crack,
lightning struck the peak right across the river. An eerie light
filled the canyon, and a humming sound reverberated from the peak.
The wind howled against the tent, which felt like a sail about to
lift off.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly I felt something warm and furry leaning against my feet
from outside the tent. I had seen enough bear tracks and scat along
the riverbed to conclude I was toast--or dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Cautiously, I peeked out. It was Little Bear, the Lab, trying to
get out of the wind and rain. Little Bear, it turned out, was a good
bluff but a bit of a coward at heart. I saw parts of myself in her,
and we had bonded.</TE>
<TE>   There she was, shaking, just like me. (Rick and Debbie didn't use
a tent; they slept in bags under a tarpaulin with little room for
dogs.) Little Bear figured an Eastern greenhorn might be of help, and
I welcomed the company. She relaxed, leaning against my feet as the
storm spent its fury. Then she trotted away to find Lucky.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, like most mornings on the Green, was clear and
fresh, and all of us acted as though nothing had happened. After
three hours of drifting quietly, then calmly bobbing up and down the
last soft rapids at Three Fords, we entered Gray Canyon. The rugged
mountains with tree and sagebrush slopes changed to the rock
formations of Navajo country. Flat-topped mesas, the hallmarks of
John Ford movies, appeared. Red rock walls abutted the river, and
desert vistas stretched across a far horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Rick had told me that when he takes businessmen down this river,
they talk about office matters for the first two days and finally
begin to relax on the third. Just when they start to see, they have
to pack up and leave.</TE>
<TE>   It hadn't been quite that way for me because I knew I had found
what I wanted on the first day. Still, I too had changed on this old
river. I could tell by sparkles on the water's surface whether rapids
were coming, and I could see by its eddies how big a rock the waters
hid. I could follow a submerged beaver by the stream of bubbles it
released as it explored the depths. And I could dig my toes deep in
the white sand of the riverbank, where bones and driftwood gather,
and count myself lucky for having this river come into my life at
least once.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're leaving on vacation and haven't shopped for sunscreen
lately, allow some extra time.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the familiar lotions, you can buy sunscreen as spray, gel
or stick. Some sprays and lotions change colors when rubbed in, a
feature most often found in products aimed at kids. Lotion may have
built-in glitter or insect repellent. Self-tanners sometimes include
sunscreen. And the old sun-block standbys, zinc oxide and titanium
oxide--the stuff lifeguards sport on their noses--have been improved
so they look better.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing the pros and cons of each product can help you minimize
the risk of sunburn and, in the long term, skin cancer. But if you're
like most sunscreen users, you may still need a little help to use
the product effectively.</LD>
<TE>   Any traveler who will spend time outdoors should pay heed to sun
protection, but those headed for the tropics or mountains--where
ultraviolet exposure is stronger--should be especially vigilant, says
Dr. Richard Wagner, a professor of dermatology at the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and an expert on sun protection.</TE>
<TE>   Those with type 1 skin, which, Wagner says, "never tans, always
burns," should pay particular attention. People with type 1 skin are
fair, have some red in their hair and may have lots of freckles, he
says. Certain medications--including some antibiotics,
antidepressants and antihistamines--also increase sun sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Although fair-skinned people are at higher risk of skin cancer,
anyone can get it. This year, more than 1 million cases of basal cell
and squamous cell cancers, both highly curable, are expected to be
diagnosed, according to American Cancer Society projections.
Melanoma, the most deadly form, will be diagnosed in about 54,000
people in the U.S. this year.</TE>
<TE>   With all the sunscreen product options, which is best?</TE>
<TE>   The newer sprays and sticks are promoted as less messy and more
convenient. But David Steinberg, a Princeton, N.J.-based sunscreen
consultant and chemist, thinks lotions are better because they
provide a uniform film with no missed spots if applied thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner likes the sprays and novelty offerings meant for children
because they may inspire more regular use.</TE>
<TE>   And the lifeguards' zinc oxide and titanium oxide, which scatter
or reflect UV rays, are still very effective, Wagner says. The newer
formulas use micronized oxide particles that are not noticeable once
applied, making them "more cosmetically elegant," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Sunscreens should protect against both ultraviolet A (UVA) and
ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure, experts concur. Sunburn is associated
with the shorter-wavelength UVB. The longer-wavelength UVA, which is
associated with aging, damages the skin at deeper levels. But
"there's an overlap," Wagner says. "B is the shorter, more energetic
wavelength. It's associated with sunburn and skin cancer. But in the
laboratory, big enough doses of A also result in skin cancer. And A
also causes immunosuppression at the cellular level, which can set
you up for skin cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Be sure the sunscreen has an SPF--sun protection factor--of at
least 15, Wagner says. SPF is a measure of how long a product lets
you stay in the sun without burning. If you usually begin to burn
after 10 minutes, an SPF of 4 multiplies your safe exposure time by
four, to 40 minutes; SPF 15 multiplies it by 15, conferring 150
minutes of protection. "Theoretically, you can stop a sunburn if you
reapply sunscreen enough," Wagner says.</TE>
<TE>   If you are at greater than average risk of sunburn or if you are
on a medication regimen that increases your sun sensitivity, choose a
sunscreen with an SPF higher than 15. Is a product with an SPF of 50
worth it? "You do get a few more percentage points of protection than
with an SPF of, say, 30," Wagner says. "But it's not double."</TE>
<TE>   Sunless tanning products--which use dihydroxyacetone, or DHA, to
color the skin--don't always include a sunscreen. But under new
federal regulations, the absence of sunscreen must be noted on the
label. If you use a sunless tanner, the Skin Cancer Foundation
recommends choosing one with an SPF 15 sunscreen.</TE>
<TE>   Tanning pills are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration
and do not protect the skin from UV. They have been linked to side
effects such as the deposition of tiny crystals in the retina. The
crystals are made of canthaxanthin, the coloring agent in the pills
that causes the "tan."</TE>
<TE>   Once you've stowed the ideal sunscreen in your luggage, be sure
you know how to use it correctly.</TE>
<TE>   How long an application lasts depends on how much you sweat,
whether you get wet and other factors. "Waterproof" products are
designed to protect for up to 80 minutes in the water,
"water-resistant" for up to 40 minutes. "Sweatproof" sunscreens are
meant to bond to the skin on contact so the product won't run off.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to reapply is the downfall of many sunscreen users. Wagner
interviewed 67 adult beachgoers who used sunscreen; nearly
three-quarters still burned, typically because they did not reapply
the product after swimming.</TE>
<TE>   When he questioned the beachgoers who did not go home with a
sunburn, he found they reapplied their sunscreen every one to two
hours and after swimming. Swimmers who used sunscreen were more
likely to burn than nonswimming sunscreen users.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner cites a recent study by the American Academy of Dermatology
that found that people who waited more than 2 1/2 hours before
reapplying sunscreen had five times the risk of sunburn compared with
those who reapplied it every two hours.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds frequent, Wagner notes that "a British researcher
thinks sunscreen should be reapplied every 20 minutes. That obviously
hasn't caught on here."</TE>
<TE>   It's also important to use enough. The American Academy of
Dermatology recommends using an ounce of sunscreen--enough to fill a
shot glass--to cover the exposed areas of the body.</TE>
<TE>   Incomplete coverage is another common mistake, according to the
Skin Cancer Foundation. The areas most often overlooked are the ears,
temples and neck.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Having visited the Black Hills of South Dakota, I appreciated Susan
Spano's article ("In Patriotic Times, Rushmore Calls," June 2) and
the importance this place played in American history. I would like to
emphasize an important point about the monuments that coexist there.
Though Rushmore is a fantastic memorial, we must remember it was
built on land that is sacred to Indians. As we view Mt. Rushmore we
need to acknowledge the arrogance of beginning a monument to the
American presidents in the sacred Black Hills 50 years after Crazy
Horse's death.</LD>
<LD>   Standing Bear, a Sioux Indian, wrote to Korczak Ziolkowski in 1939
requesting that he initiate a monument to Crazy Horse because he
wanted the world to understand that Indians have their heroes too.
History is always written by the victors, but in this time of
conflict it is vital to take into account the voice of the defeated.</LD>
<LD>   The Crazy Horse Monument is as culturally significant as Mt.
Rushmore. It is a tribute to our cultural diversity, our inherent
desire to right old wrongs and the strength of an independent spirit.</LD>

<TE>   When we went to Mt. Rushmore last summer, we discovered that
Deadwood is a real town. Nestled in a narrow canyon just north of
Rushmore, it was the home of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok.
They've rebuilt the town for tourists in the flavor of the Old West,
with casinos and all. We spent a day walking the town, including the
cemetery where Calamity and Wild Bill are buried.</TE>

<LD>There is an odor more offensive than Peter Hong's ethnic lunch
("Before Silicon Valley, There Was San Jose," Weekend Escape, May
19), and that's the faintly pungent stench of racism in June Cotter's
letter ("No Odorous Takeout Aboard, Please," June 2).</LD>
<LD>   Is it really that bad, and is it really that difficult to
tolerate? Airlines serve beer, and that smells. Same for the hot
dinners, some of which include fish and teriyaki, not to mention
beef, which, to vegetarians, has a strong odor.</LD>

<LD>In "Vacation Deprivation by the Numbers" (June 2), you used the
phrase "getting gypped." The Random House dictionary defines "gyp" as
"to defraud or rob by some sharp practice; swindle; cheat." The
etymology of the word is probably from "Gypsy," and I think Gypsies
(also known as Romanies) would consider this an ethnic slur.</LD>
<LD>   I have excised the phrase from my vocabulary. The Times should
follow suit.</LD>

<LD>In response to Susan Spano's column ("Ah, Those Travel-Writer
Perks--Let's Start With Paranoia and Secretiveness," Her World, May
26): Just the opposite can work wonders. Several years ago my friend
and I were having major problems with a local tour operator in
Nairobi, Kenya. When I casually asked if I would be receiving the
same shabby treatment if I were a travel consultant, the doors opened
to a whole new experience. Arrangements were made to keep my hotel
room for a late-night checkout, a limo delivered us to the airport,
and we received a wonderful basket to tote home our African
souvenirs, plus an invitation to tea in the tour operator's lavish
home. We enjoyed every minute.</LD>

<HD>An Alternative Universe of Student Vacations</HD>

<AU>LUCY IZON</AU>
<BD>Lucy Izon, author of "Izon's Backpacker Journal," is
based in Toronto; www.izon.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>London; Paris; Sydney, Australia; Bangkok; Hong Kong. Each summer
thousands of young travelers head to those popular cities. But where
do you find similar great destinations off the beaten path? Student
Universe, seller of discounted student and faculty air travel on the
Internet (www.studentuniverse.com), and staff from "Let's Go," the
popular student-researched budget travel guidebook series
(www.letsgo.com), have come up with a list of 10 top alternate
destinations for student travelers this summer.</LD>
<LD>   * Krakow, Poland: It's inexpensive, hip and home to scores of
museums and pubs, and it has a student population of 100,000. The
city has beautiful historic buildings and wide, uncrowded squares
where you can relax.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, its youth hostel is large and noisy, so check the
local tourist information office (in the railway station) for
dormitory accommodations or families who have rooms for rent. Student
Universe/"Let's Go" suggests a daily budget of $37 to visit Krakow.</LD>
<TE>   For a day trip out of the city, it recommends a visit to the
1,000-year-old Wieliczka salt mine, a UNESCO World Heritage site with
chapels and chambers carved out of salt, just eight miles outside
town. You might also consider the 90-minute trip by public bus to the
Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps. The round-trip fare is about
$5. Go in the morning because the English-language information film
is shown at 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   A new way to reach Krakow cheaply and easily from any of five
Eastern European countries is with the second-class Eastern Europe
Rail Pass, which was introduced by Rail Europe (www.raileurope.com)
this summer. It offers five days of unlimited travel within one month
throughout Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia
for $154.</TE>
<TE>   To Krakow, I would add another attractive lesser-known Eastern
European city: Bratislava, Slovakia. It's only one hour by rail from
Vienna, and prices plunge as you cross the border. A half-liter of
beer is 50 cents, Internet cafes charge about 2 cents per minute and
a dorm bed in a student residence in the summer is about $8. About
60,000 of its 450,000 residents are students. The streets are
charming, quiet and uncrowded. Mozart and Liszt lived in Bratislava,
and "Amadeus" was filmed here.</TE>
<TE>   The social scene is literally underground. Archways open into
courtyard cafes, and steps lead to basement jazz clubs and
restaurants. This is the city the Viennese slip off to for opera
performances for only $20. When you want to get out of town, ride the
rails to the Tatras, a compact (40-by-15-mile) mountain region
between Slovakia and Poland, for hiking and biking.</TE>
<TE>   Other alternate destinations recommended by Student Universe and
"Let's Go":</TE>
<TE>   * Cappadocia, Turkey: It boasts some of the world's most bizarre
scenery and sites. For about $30 a day, you can visit ancient
underground cities and stay in hostel rooms carved out of the earth.
For transportation, try the backpacker bus service Fez Travel,
www.feztravel.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Taupo, New Zealand: On the North Island, Taupo is the place for
bungee jumping, mountain biking, windsurfing, kayaking, white-water
rafting and skydiving. The recommended budget: $35 per day. For
backpacker bus services, contact Stray Travel Network New Zealand,
www.straytravel.co.nz; Kiwi Experience, www.kiwiexperience.com; or
Magic Bus, www.magicbus.co.nz.</TE>
<TE>   * Torquay, Australia: Surfers can follow the Great Ocean Road to
this low-key Australian beach town. Budget $46 per day. To get there,
try these backpacker bus services: Wayward Bus,
www.waywardbus.com.au, or Oz Experience, www.ozexperience.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: Shop, go clubbing or head for the
amazingly clear waters of nearby Pulau Tioman. Budget $33 per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Banos, Ecuador: Hikers will find that this Andes town, named for
its popular hot springs, is also a good jumping-off point for jungle
excursions. Budget $25 per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Stellenbosch, South Africa: A wine region just an hour from Cape
Town, with a local university population to rev up the night life.
Budget $40 per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Brighton, England: "Fatboy Slim's" hometown rocks with techno
and house music, and a blind eye is turned as bathers peel it
off--all off--at England's premier beach. Budget $65 per day.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S.:</TE>
<TE>   * Coney Island, N.Y.: This is Brooklyn the way it was during its
golden era, in the 1940s and '50s. Rides such as the Parachute Jump,
the Wonder Wheel and the Cyclone are legendary in these parts. Budget
$150 per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Austin, Texas: Austin's history of musical innovation (the city
is known as the "Live Music Capital of the World") and the 50,000
students at the University of Texas make it one of the country's most
vibrant cities. Budget $70 per day.</TE>

<HD>Starting Over</HD>
<DH>The story behind 'Street Time' comes from the series
creator's own struggle to reinvent his life after prison</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Showtime has deliberately shied away from producing original series
focusing on cops, lawyers and doctors because shows dealing with
those professions dominate the network schedule. But the pay-cable
outlet has reversed its policy with the gritty "Street Time,"
premiering Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Morrow, in his first series since "Northern Exposure," plays a
parolee who spent five years in a federal penitentiary for marijuana
smuggling and is trying to reconnect with his wife and young son
while steering clear of the lifestyle that led to his downfall. Scott
Cohen ("NYPD Blue") and Erika Alexander are parole officers.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Offsay, president of programming at Showtime, says the
series isn't so much a cop show as one exploring "good and bad and
grays. I think that's what got us to develop this show in the first
place. If it were only told from the point of view of the parole
officers, we would have passed."</LD>
<TE>   The series was created and is executive produced by Richard
Stratton, who wrote the underground cult novel "Smack Goddess" and
was himself convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana and hashish
in 1982. "I was in prison for eight years," says Stratton. "There was
an illegality in my sentence I discovered after I had been locked up
for six or seven years. By the time I got the sentence vacated and
got resentenced to 10 years, I had done about eight years and they
had to let me go."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow's character, Kevin Hunter, is based largely on his
experiences--"though I didn't have the wife and young child,"
Stratton notes. "But I saw all of those other people in prison who
did. I was always moved by that business--how do you connect and keep
a relationship alive when you are locked up?"</TE>
<TE>   He also struggled with returning to his former life. "I was owed a
lot of money and part of me felt like I deserved the money, but it
became apparent to me that even trying to collect that money and
seeing these people were enough to get me back into prison," Stratton
says. "I needed to leave this life totally behind me. I became really
interested in the question of whether or not people can reinvent
themselves in the middle of their lives. I was in my 40s when I got
out of prison. Fortunately, I had published a novel when I was locked
up and I had a whole other career that was beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander and Cohen's parole officers are based on Stratton's
parole officers. "My first parole officer was a black woman who was
very understanding and a reasonable person," he says. But his second
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "He read me the riot act," says Stratton, and "then he started to
show up at my house at 7 in the morning and 11 at night. Ultimately,
I feel like maybe that close supervision he kept me under during that
very vulnerable time was one of the contributing factors to my going
straight."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was intrigued by the complexity of his character. The
officer is battling his own demons in the form of a gambling
addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very attracted to characters that have lots of flaws because
I think we all do," he says. "I think it's interesting to watch and
play. His life is slowly spinning out of control. It gets really
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, Showtime will unveil its third-season premieres
of its African American drama, "Soul Food," and its Latino-themed
series, "Resurrection Blvd." Last Friday, the network also launched
its new sci-fi series, "Odyssey 5."</TE>
<TE>   "Some day the networks will wake up and realize that people watch
TV 52 weeks a year," says Offsay. "Until they do, we are going to
take advantage of the fact that we have this gaping hole when there
is nothing new or fresh on."</TE>
<TE>   Offsay admits, though, that Showtime waited too late last year
when it premiered the short-lived series "Going to California" and
"Leap Years" in mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   "We got three weeks to ourselves and then the networks were back,"
he says. "The series just fell off the map once we got into the
second week in September."</TE>
<TE>   "Street Time" can be seen Sundays at 10 p.m. on Showtime. The
network has rated the premiere TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children
under 17). "Soul Food" and "Resurrection Blvd." can be seen
Wednesdays at 10 and 10:45 p.m., respectively, on Showtime. Both
series are rated TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under 14).</TE>

<HD>Old-Growth Forest Sparks Dispute After Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Forest Service says salvage logging will reduce
fire risks. But environmentalists contend that some trees are still
alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SONNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>EMIGRANT GAP, Calif.</DL>
<LD>EMIGRANT GAP, Calif. -- Part of the Tahoe National Forest that burned
in a 2,400-acre wildfire last summer looks just the way one might
imagine.</LD>
<LD>   Charred limbs and twigs rise from the scorched, black earth among
pockets of standing skeletons of trees with brown needles.</LD>
<LD>   Downed, dead logs of charcoal are scattered across the top of the
Sierra a mile south of Interstate 80.</LD>
<TE>   The scene matches the description of the devastation in a Forest
Service analysis done for a pending salvage logging project.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gap fire was an unusually complete burn," the Forest
Service's environmental assessment says. "Very little of the
aboveground vegetation in this area appears to have survived."</TE>
<TE>   But walk a few hundred yards down the Old Stage Road in the
900-acre logging area along the North Fork of the American River,
past the woodpeckers and a bear's 8-inch-long footprints, and you'll
find something you wouldn't expect:</TE>
<TE>   Big, green trees. Lots of them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service is claiming the forest is completely dead,"
said Chad Hanson, head of the John Muir Project that is fighting the
logging with the Earth Island Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "But clearly that's not the case for at least half of the project
area. In most areas the big trees have only been mildly scorched and
most of those are going to live," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He points to dozens of large green stands of incense cedars, red
firs, white firs, sugar pines and ponderosa pines, some hundreds of
years old and more than 100 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire did come through here but it did not destroy the forest.
This forest is very clearly alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service scientists say many trees that look alive are
actually dead, soon will turn brown and eventually fall to the forest
floor to serve as fuel for another, hotter fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe Chad has the background he needs in natural
resources to tell the difference," said Bob Cary, Forest Service team
leader for the Gap fire salvage project. "I'm not sure he knows
exactly what he is looking at."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is the latest between Forest Service officials and
environmental groups challenging government plans to log forests in
the name of reducing fire risks.</TE>
<TE>   The agency and its backers say thinning and salvage operations are
essential to reduce dead and dying timber in national forests
throughout the West.</TE>
<TE>   "There just aren't too many places in the timbered areas of
California that won't burn any more," said Tim Feller of Sierra
Pacific Industries, one of the largest landowners in the state. "With
the combination of 100 years of fire suppression and forest fuel
buildup, it's a no-brainer any more."</TE>
<TE>   The Gap fire burned for nearly two weeks last August, closing the
interstate between Sacramento and Reno, Nev. The Forest Service
estimates the fire killed more than 350,000 trees larger than 2
inches thick, about 90% of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Eubanks, Forest Service supervisor of the Tahoe National
Forest, said some dead wood is good for soil nutrients and wildlife
habitat, but "the massive amount represented by all the dead trees
presents a problem because, as grasses and brush sprout and grow amid
the dead logs, severe fire hazard develops."</TE>
<TE>   Cary calculates there are enough standing dead trees for one to
fall every seven hours for the next 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salvage logging has been hotly debated since President Clinton
drew the ire of environmentalists by signing a pro-logging measure
pushed by Northwest Congress members in 1994--a move Vice President
Al Gore later called the biggest mistake of Clinton's first term.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, President Bush said in a statement to a Wildland Fire
Conference in Idaho that he wants to promote "sound forest management
to restore forest health....</TE>
<TE>   "In many areas, this will require active forest management efforts
to thin our forests of excessive natural fuels and restore native
vegetation to our forests and rangelands."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many industry leaders criticize the Forest Service for not
moving quickly enough.</TE>
<TE>   In an article headlined "Federal Fiddling While California Burns,"
California Forest Products Commission Chairman Donn Zea complained
that federal forests grow billions of unharvested board feet each
year, creating concentrated fuel for wildfires. Average acres burned
in the Sierra jumped from about 300,000 in the mid-1980s to more than
750,000 by the end of the 1990s, Zea said.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't happening because people are throwing more matches out
their car windows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much of the dispute hinges on guidelines used to predict whether a
tree is dead or will die.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service makes a decision primarily by estimating "crown
scorch"--the percentage of the tree's foliage that has been burned.
Agency workers also sometimes hack into the bark to see if the tree's
inner skin, the cambium, has been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the Forest Service considers a ponderosa pine to be
dead if it has at least 55% crown scorch.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, who has been active in forest protection for 12 years, and
Fazio subscribe to new research that suggests many ponderosa pines
survive with as much as 95% crown scorch.</TE>
<TE>   Cary said that defies common sense.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a tree that is in your front yard and you cut 95% of
the foliage off it, is it going to live? It might, but probably not,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are finding over and over again, particularly with
ponderosa pine, is the buds will burst with new foliage the following
spring, and some of those will live and continue to grow. But many of
them I've seen, the new foliage bursts out and it wilts and dies,"
Cary said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Forest Service said only dead trees in the Gap
fire will be removed--meaning those with no visible green foliage.</TE>
<TE>   The original environmental assessment issued in April estimated
95% of the Gap project area was dead. A flyover May 12 revised the
estimate to about 87%, Cary said.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson estimates about half of the forest is dead or dying but the
rest will recover. He doesn't trust the agency to take only dead
trees, especially because the area has been closed to the public and
no one may observe the logging operation expected to begin this fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back on the site, the Old Stage Road wanders through a classic
cathedral grove of old-growth trees, with ponderosa pines towering
100 feet in the air. One estimated to be more than 300 years old is
more than 4 feet in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson estimates its crown scorch at 5%. Black scorch marks reach
about 5 feet up the bark.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the project area, bordering clear-cut private
lands, is a large collection of old-growth, which overlaps into an
area he says is suitable habitat for the California spotted owl.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping from the hot midday sun on the dusty road into the damp
shade of the forest, the temperature drops noticeably.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel the difference immediately," Hanson said as
mosquitoes began to swarm.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a blind person can tell," Fazio said. "It doesn't take a ...
forester to tell you you're in an old-growth forest."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A tiny songbird that lives in coastal sage scrub has proved to be one
of Orange County's most influential residents since the early 1990s.
After the slow-growth debate of the late 1980s, the California
gnatcatcher soon became an emblem of tensions between environmental
protection and the rights of developers to build on their land. As
the suburbs spread southward, the bird became the focus of debate
over what it meant to lose land forever to development.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes a decision by a federal judge that ensures that federal
wildlife officials retain their power to modify or in rare cases ban
development in designated areas, raising the bar on what land is
buildable. This tougher standard will be in place until U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service officials can address the economic concerns
developers have raised about having restrictions on their building.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration had sought to leave the land open to
development while the agency conducted its new study of the economic
impact of protection on property owners. But the judge's ruling is
the only sensible course of action while the data are sorted out,
precisely because land subjected to the bulldozer is forever altered.</LD>
<TE>   The judge has acknowledged the concerns of developers by ordering
Fish and Wildlife to accelerate its review process and complete its
study in 10 months, which was less than half the time the agency had
sought. So there is a little something for everyone. The land and its
emblematic gnatcatcher are saved from the bulldozer and the builders'
concerns will be addressed quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The prevention of widespread habitat destruction is especially
crucial in Orange County, where several major projects are on the
drawing boards. The Rancho Mission Viejo development has 14,000 homes
slated for South County in a region widely praised for its remarkable
biodiversity. The gnatcatcher has been a key resident of this
wonderfully diverse acreage. The planned Foothill South toll road
also is potentially damaging to gnatcatcher habitat. Indeed, the same
judge previously ordered the federal agency to identify critical
gnatcatcher habitat in the area where the road would be built.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the concept of habitat preservation has been a
potential meeting ground for developers and environmentalists. Now
everybody on both sides speaks the language of habitat preservation.
The Transportation Corridor Agencies, for example, long criticized
for cutting a swath through pristine hills for the San Joaquin Hills
corridor, point proudly to their restoration and creation of
thousands of acres of habitat.</TE>
<TE>   But while habit preservation has been a way for all sides to
affirm their commitment to balance, the reality is that things change
once the graders start rolling. That is why the judicial branch is an
important component of environmental protection.</TE>
<TE>   While there may be some delay for builders pending new rules, they
ought to get their answer from an agency that previously did not
satisfy their concerns. In the meantime, the land--and the tiny
songbirds--get a welcome reprieve.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors faces tough questions in the
wake of its decision to pay $650,000 to survivors of an inmate who
died from head injuries shortly after being booked into the Orange
County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors and the Sheriff's Department have declined to comment
on the settlement to be paid to two children of Gilbert Garcia, a
32-year-old inmate who died June 1, 1998, two days after being
carried out of the County Jail on a stretcher after a struggle with
deputies.</LD>
<LD>   A coroner's report indicated that Garcia died of internal bleeding
caused by a skull fracture, and Garcia's survivors maintain that a
grainy jail surveillance tape proves that the inmate was mistreated</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney's office, which investigated the death,
concluded that Garcia exhibited symptoms of a head injury when he was
booked into Orange County Jail on May 30.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney cleared the Sheriff's Department of
wrongdoing but has said it would review any new evidence in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's family continues to allege that his civil rights were
violated, and the FBI is still investigating what happened inside the
jail--one of five similar probes into claims of brutality inside the
jail. The settlement, approved by a 4-1 vote, adds to existing
concerns about jail brutality and civil-rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1991 and 2000, the county paid $445,000 in taxpayer funds
for injury claims filed on behalf of inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The previous highest settlement was $100,000 for a case involving
a 43-year-old inmate who died in 1995 after fighting with deputies.</TE>
<TE>   We welcome the FBI's continued involvement because a federal
investigation seems more likely to produce an independent review of
Garcia's death and other cases in which county investigations into
inmate charges of abuse have arisen.</TE>
<TE>   County residents deserve an investigation of charges made by
inmates and explanations offered by deputies.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an easy task given the charged environment inside a jail,
where the potential for violence is omnipresent.</TE>
<TE>   The tense atmosphere demands, however, that those charged with
running the facilities ensure that inmates are not mistreated.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, a grand jury underlined the potential for
serious problems when it cited an "oppressive and threatening
atmosphere" inside the main county jail that jurors blamed on a
"vicious cycle of mutual antagonism and harassment between inmates
and deputies."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI needs to determine whether excessive force was used in the
Garcia case and other incidents in which inmates have alleged abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The public must have confidence that sheriff's deputies are in
control of the jail, and that staffing levels and training are
sufficient to produce a humane and safe environment for inmates and
deputies alike.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is the potential for more allegations of violation
of prisoners' rights, and more settlements and court judgments borne
by taxpayers.</TE>

<LD>Costly commuter train lines and expensive freeway-widening projects
necessarily must be a part of Orange County's effort to keep commuter
traffic from grinding to a halt. But the Orange County Transportation
Authority also owes it to commuters to focus on smaller pieces of the
transportation puzzle.</LD>
<LD>   A case in point is the proposed Bus Rapid Transit system that
promises to trim up to 18 minutes per ride for bus riders on Harbor
Boulevard and Westminster Avenue, two of OCTA's busiest corridors.
OCTA will review a project proposal in July for the two lines that
would cost $11 million to create and about $4.8 million annually to
operate.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed express lines would allow bus drivers to toggle
switches that trigger green lights as buses approach intersections.
Electronic devices in bus shelters would give commuters real-time
schedule updates, and passengers would purchase tickets through
vending machines.</LD>
<TE>   The Bus Rapid Transit plan is based upon the express buses that
have been crisscrossing cities nationwide for decades. The closest
example is Los Angeles' wildly popular new Metro Rapid buses. Some
cities have been adding dedicated bus lanes to make service even
swifter; OCTA's routes will make do with existing concrete along
Westminster and Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA clearly has to continue working on big projects, including
the widening of a two-mile stretch of the Santa Ana Freeway leading
into Los Angeles County and the long-awaited reconstruction of the
Garden Grove Freeway. OCTA also should continue to research the
expensive and controversial CenterLine light rail proposal that would
run through Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   But OCTA shouldn't expect county residents to keep supporting the
big projects if the authority isn't perceived as paying attention to
local transportation knots as well. Bus Rapid Transit proponents
believe 10,000 to 16,000 additional riders would use OCTA buses on
Harbor and Westminster. That's welcome news for anyone traveling
those busy roads.</TE>
<TE>   The Bus Rapid Transit routes also are part of OCTA's recognition
that transportation doesn't just mean more freeway lanes. Bus
ridership slipped during the late 1990s, in part because of
ill-advised route changes and fare increases. The buses that soon
could be rolling would only boost ridership by a small fraction. But
the proposal shows that OCTA recognizes that incremental improvements
are necessary to keep public transit use growing.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Editorial Incurs Pro-Airport Wrath</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Coad Threat to Base's Future," editorial, June 16:</LD>
<LD>   Your editorial misses the point. Three months ago The Times
complimented Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad for her vote to cede El Toro
to Irvine. Coad's vote was predicated on one simple issue--she wanted
an ironclad commitment from Irvine that $800,000 per year from El
Toro's development would be earmarked for North County parks. The
deal, brokered by Supervisor Todd Spitzer, was viewed as a turning
point in the El Toro airport debate. Irvine agreed to it and Coad,
Spitzer and Irvine's representatives shook hands.</LD>
<LD>   She held up her end of the bargain. An era of peace, love and
flower power was ushered in. It should come as no surprise to anyone
who has dealt with the city of Irvine on the El Toro issue that the
"ironclad" deal was not forthcoming.</LD>
<TE>   The park money from Irvine is as illusive as the Great Park.
Coad's intentions are noble. She thought a deal was a deal.
Unfortunately, she's not dealing with noble people.</TE>
<TE>   David Ellis</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>

<TE>   Only a dyed-in-the-wool anti-El Toro International Airport writer
could have written your editorial. I thought you were worried about
the airport, but no, your priorities were with housing developments
and diploma mills that keep popping up as proposals in and around the
former El Toro military base.</TE>
<TE>   We need the planned El Toro International Airport. It is a natural
airport site and the Southern California Assn. of Governments has not
backed down on its assessment of 30 million annual Orange County
airline passengers by 2005. Also, there was no mention in your
editorial of pending litigation against Measure W, which may well
deflate the balloon of local control, as it did with its predecessor,
Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we must consider the roles of Sacramento and Washington
in the battle for El Toro. The state Assembly has passed AB 2333, an
airport bill, and Congress is taking up national zoning legislation
in the House and Senate. So much for local control when it becomes
irresponsible control.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Nyre</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coad, a visionary with the highest integrity who is looking out
for the interests of citizens in north Orange County, should be
applauded. Officials in Irvine promised funding for parks in northern
Orange County in exchange for her support. Now, the city might not
make good on its promise. This shouldn't be surprising because the
city might not make good on its promise of a Great Park either. We
now see new El Toro plans from Irvine that are in the "spirit" or
"likeness" of Measure W. The Great Park and Measure W were a bait and
switch to kill the airport, plain and simple.</TE>
<TE>   It appears now that there is no viably sound financial plan for
the Great Park. Measure W is being legally challenged. All parties
should pause and let our legal system work. Remember that Measure F
was rendered invalid by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial also implies that if El Toro is not annexed by
Irvine and remains in the county's jurisdiction, the county somehow
will be responsible for developing the Great Park. Not true.
Annexation provides only zoning control. Land ownership is a separate
matter. The ultimate landowners will develop the property, under the
zoning restrictions placed upon the land by the governing
authority--whichever government body that is.</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial reminds us that the airport was rejected by the
voters. It is important to mention that due to the very low voter
turnout in March, only about 10% of the county's population voted to
reject the airport plan. That small percentage made a land-use
decision for the entire county. Be prudent and let the court system
decide the legality of all of this.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Simon</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial stating that Coad is threatening the future of the
El Toro Marine air base is pure poppycock. Coad is trying to salvage
a legacy from her years as an ardent supporter for a commercial
airport at the El Toro Marine air base and is grasping at straws to
reward her constituents with more North County park areas after she
is replaced by an unknown college history teacher who was financed by
Irvine and other south Orange County political institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The decision regarding the use of El Toro is not yet at an end.
There is a lawsuit underway challenging the passage of Measure W on
the grounds that it was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W will be overturned just as Measure F was declared
unconstitutional, despite the utterances of The Times' editorial
staff. Even with the stampede of articles and editorials and actions
by South County politicians, the U.S. Navy requires a formal plan
before it will transfer the base.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has already tried to annex the base as a method of gaining
complete control. The Irvine Co., which owns all the land surrounding
El Toro, is exerting pressure by building on land outside the airport
noise buffer zone. There is little doubt that the power of this
combination will have significant influence on county supervisors
after Coad is out of office.</TE>
<TE>   The Times editorial again ignores the air passenger demand
predicted for Southern California that, within a few years, will
swamp Los Angeles International Airport, Ontario International
Airport and John Wayne Airport. Those predictions assigned 30 million
passengers per year to the El Toro commercial airport.</TE>
<TE>   What is left to handle Orange County's growing air passenger
demand is John Wayne Airport with one 5,700-foot runway and a
nighttime curfew that is subject to the whimsical nature of the FAA.
The future of Newport Beach, Costa Mesa and Tustin, with no noise
buffer zone, is little better than the Los Angeles neighborhoods of
Inglewood, El Segundo and Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   I urge Coad to rescind her vote to join Irvine Mayor Larry Agran
and his south Orange County cohorts and await outcome of the Measure
W lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph P. Morgan</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In this editorial were some clear truths. Unfortunately, your
premises and, therefore, your conclusions were fatally flawed.</TE>
<TE>   You said Coad "wrongly" tied her support to Irvine's providing
$800,000 a year for 100 years to help fund park improvements in the
north. The only "wrongly" in her requirement was that she asked for
far too little.</TE>
<TE>   That $800,000 is about the price of one acre of land at today's
market price. If Irvine were to pony it up every year for 100 years
it would represent only 100 measly acres of equivalent parkland.</TE>

<LD>   If administrators at Irvine Valley College do for the hotel and
theater business what they've done for public education, count on
poor service and bad reviews. Having nearly destroyed what once was
the finest community college in the state, they plan to sell off
what's left.</LD>
<LD>   Taxpayers have a right to be confused about the latest shenanigans
at IVC. What's more alarming, a loose cannon dean who thinks he's
Conrad Hilton or a board of trustees that doesn't seem to know a

<LD>Re "Internet Cafes Face Crackdown," June 11:</LD>
<LD>   Senseless killings can never be excused, but cyber cafes should
not be held responsible. Parents should be responsible for their
children. Too often, parents abdicate that responsibility, expecting
schools and businesses to raise their children.</LD>
<LD>   If kids are violating the curfew, fine the parents instead of
putting more controls on businesspeople who are just trying to make a
living. Perhaps that would send a message that bearing a child isn't
enough--it's a parent's job to teach that child how to live in our
society, too.</LD>

<TE>   Placing the blame for violent acts on Internet cafes is
irresponsible. It is obvious that Garden Grove has a gang problem.
The Garden Grove City Council would do well to admit this and target
the gang members, instead of business owners who are trying to make
an honest dollar.</TE>
<TE>   I live in the Santa Clarita Valley, where there are five Internet
cafes. These businesses do not have any problems because Santa
Clarita doesn't have a gang problem. Your article and Garden Grove
Mayor Bruce Broadwater's comments give Internet cafes an undeserved
black eye. If anything, Internet cafes are beneficial. When youths
are sitting at computers playing games for hours on end, they are too
busy to be out carousing and causing problems.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cleanup Time for Ralphs," editorial, June 13:</LD>
<LD>   I agree that Ralphs should do what it agreed to do as far as
switching some of its trucks from diesel fuel to cleaner-burning
natural gas. However, when the economic equation radically changes,
business should be allowed flexibility.</LD>
<LD>   "Yard goats," the smaller trucks used inside distribution centers,
do not pollute to the same extent that road units do, and converting
them is really a joke.</LD>
<TE>   In regard to converting "older trucks with 100,000 miles": A truck
is built to run 500,000 miles before touching the engine. A truck
with 100,000 miles on it is new. I'm a sales representative for a
fleet composed of 1998 and 1999 models; each truck has 650,000 to
750,000 miles on it. The vehicles are now due what is called an
"in-frame," a procedure that is barely more than a tuneup. Your
comparison of buses to trucks is like comparing trucks to trains.
Buses carry a maximum payload of say 40,000 pounds while trucks carry
a maximum of 80,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   If you need information on trucking, I could set you up with
extremely qualified local experts to use as references.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pupils Develop 'Habits of Heart' During Skits," June 9:</LD>
<LD>   The after-school program mentioned in the article seemed like a
great idea. This program will probably improve the character of the
children and help them to develop necessary problem-solving
techniques. This program would be even more beneficial if it were
incorporated in the curriculum for all schools in the country.</LD>
<LD>   This program would be more helpful for teens. Conflicts the young
children were trying to solve seemed much too "adult" for children at
that age. Small kids should not have to think about equal pay and job
opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   It seems like this program is going to make adults out of children
too fast. I think this program should be introduced to children above
the age of 12 and continued through high school.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bill Urges O.C. to Fly Its Share," May 30:</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Bill 2333 is an attempt to punish Orange County voters
for rejecting an airport at El Toro. This bill has passed the
Assembly and is before the Senate in Sacramento. It sets the
dangerous precedent of ignoring the voice of those closest to the
local issues.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles World Airways, which operates LAX and the
underutilized Ontario and Palmdale airports, has concentrated the
vast majority of passenger and cargo flights at LAX, rather than
distributing flights to its other airports. LAX can solve its
problems by making use of existing capacity, not by forcing Orange
County to build an unneeded and environmentally disastrous second
airport.</LD>
<TE>   AB 2333 would try to limit growth at LAX by forcing Orange County
to absorb much of the aviation need generated by population growth in
Los Angeles County. But LAX's problems are being exacerbated by
growth in Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, not growth in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has flown out of LAX would have to agree that it has
grown too large. But Sacramento lawmakers should insist that a
regional airport be close to projected population centers in L.A. and
the Inland Empire to minimize the cost, congestion, and pollution
generated by vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has debated a second airport for nearly 10 years.
Meanwhile, John Wayne Airport is capable of handling up to twice its
current passenger capacity without expansion and without adding
nighttime operations.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2333 addresses just four counties--Los Angeles, Orange, San
Bernardino and Riverside. It ignores the fact that Sacramento and San
Francisco send airline passengers to airports in other counties. If
California legislators believe that this bill is appropriate, they
should extend the bill to include every county in the state.</TE>
<TE>   This bill is an attempt to strip Orange County of its independence
in transit matters and make our county a colony of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The bill introduced by State Assemblyman George Nakano
(D-Torrance) attempts to force Orange County to build an unneeded and
unwanted airport at El Toro. County voters have twice rejected this
plan and to withhold funds from us if we don't build an airport would
be laughable if it weren't so insidious. Officials in Los Angeles
County have spent decades cornering the lion's share of the air
travel and air cargo business at LAX, hoarding domestic and
international routes and catering to the airlines' every whim.</TE>
<TE>   This has occurred at the expense of property values and quality of
life for what used to be very nice communities near LAX. Los Angeles
County has supported the airlines' flawed hub-and-spoke system and
allowed airports in Burbank, Palmdale, and Ontario to go
underutilized. Well, they got what they wanted, but now they've
decided that living next to a large airport is unpleasant and they've
decided to try to export their problem.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of planning on Los Angeles' part does not constitute an
emergency for Orange County. We have an airport that can serve Orange
County's needs for decades without any expansion and we have no
desire to import passengers from LAX. I suggest Nakano try listening
to the will of Orange County voters and develop another plan to fix
Los Angeles' problem.</TE>

<LD>Re "Parents Should Choose Their Kid's School," letters, June 16:</LD>
<LD>   Anything coming from Ken Williams is amusing. Here is a member of
the Orange County Board of Education, whose children have always
attended private schools. Here is a person who ran the anti-recall
campaign for the Orange Unified School District out of his doctor's
office while supporting candidates who were in charge as more than
1,000 teachers left the district.</LD>
<LD>   I am wary of anything coming from Williams, and I wish he would
keep his private school agenda away from our public schools.</LD>

<LD>Re "County Has Options After El Toro Vote," letters, June 9:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you pilot and aircraft owner Patrick Barry for your letter
that states what the Airline Pilots Assn. said from the beginning.
The El Toro runways will not work, and neither will an international
airport in southern Orange County. The "never say die" pro-airport
politicians and uninformed people of Orange County will never
acknowledge this.</LD>
<LD>   The residents of Leisure World look down on the runways, which are
so close one can almost spit on them.</LD>
<TE>   An airport would mark the demise of Leisure World, which is home
to 18,000 people, and other nearby communities. No one could tolerate
the noise from the low-flying jumbo jets 24 hours a day. People
complain about the millions of dollars already spent for the possible
airport; just think what the real thing would cost. Staggering!</TE>
<TE>   There is no law that says Orange County must have two airports.
There is no place or room for an airport in southern Orange County.
The voters have made that clear.</TE>

<TE>   Robert M. Beard is of the opinion that "the entire region should

regional vote should decide whether to extend the artificial
passenger caps at John Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The entire region knows that our airport is limited to 50% of its
design capacity by the self-serving operating limits imposed by
neighboring Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   If Beard is so adamant in his desire to allow the entire region to
determine airport capacity, then we must not allow Newport Beach
alone to dictate John Wayne's operation.</TE>

capacity. He continues that "the entire region should be empowered to

on whether we build El Toro to serve LAX's overflow. Be careful what
you wish for, Mr. Beard. Bill Konther</TE>

<LD>Re "Hotel Wave Hits Coastal Southland," June 15:</LD>
<LD>   It makes me weary to think that few people are questioning the
possible social implications of these large luxury hotels on our
communities. Increasing numbers of nonwhite immigrant workers will be
recruited for service and maintenance jobs at these hotels. The
question is if we are willing to "deal" with the greater presence of
those who must work below the minimum wage in order to survive.</LD>
<LD>   The race to improve and expand luxury hotels is little more than
an desire to breathe life into the scarcely scenic Southland beaches.
This situation serves to underscore the influence and power of an
elite few and further reinforces the gap between the rich and poor.</LD>

<LD>Re: "Newport Library Eligible for Funds," June 8:</LD>
<LD>   As a tax-paying citizen for more than 25 years and a parent in the
Newport-Mesa Unified School District for more than six years, I'm
confused about Newport Beach's bid for school funds to build a
library that will mostly benefit their city and one school, Mariner's
Elementary.</LD>
<LD>   Why can't these school district funds be equally apportioned among
the rest of the district's libraries? I know our library could use
some of the funding pie. Our librarian each year conducts
time-consuming fund-raisers and relies on donations to accumulate
funds.</LD>
<TE>   Keeping children safe is a significant concern, but the general
public will be prohibited from using this "public" library's
children's section for about 30 hours per week. As a district
taxpayer, I am going to be short-changed. Even with the safety
accommodations being made for the joint-use library, nothing comes
close to being as safe or comforting as walking down the hall to an
on-campus library.</TE>

<LD>Re "Watergate Revisited With More Than the Expletives Deleted,"
Parsons column, June 16, 2002:</LD>
<LD>   It must have been while wearing a red clown nose and big floppy
shoes that Nixon apologist, I mean the executive director of the
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, put the Watergate scandal "in
context."</LD>
<LD>   John Taylor hilariously asserts that the break-in, cover-up and
the firing of a special prosecutor were the result of President Nixon
trying to end the Vietnam War. Then, as if firing a verbal seltzer at
us, Taylor says something about the president not being able to fight
a war "if his government can't keep secrets."</LD>
<TE>   I'm dying to hear Taylor put Nixon's self-recorded anti-Semitism
"in perspective." There's a cancer on American history, and it
resides at the Nixon library.</TE>

<LD>Re "Funding Public Education," editorial, May 19:</LD>
<LD>   As a parent of three students in the Irvine Unified School
District, I applaud the California State Joint Budget Conference
Committee for maintaining crucial funding levels for education in the
proposed 2002-2003 state budget.</LD>
<LD>   I urge California's lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis to fully fund
education at least at the levels recommended by the Joint Budget
Conference Committee and to make the commitment to California's
children for fair and equitable funding to public schools through
equalization funding as provided for in this year's budget proposal.</LD>
<TE>   It is critical that the 2002-2003 budget be passed by the
constitutional deadline of June 30 to ensure the Proposition 98
guarantee of funding to public schools. I urge lawmakers and Gov.
Davis to make a commitment to pass this budget on time, with the
proposed education funding intact.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I'd like to express my gratitude and pride in our elected
representatives, Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) and Sen. Dick
Ackerman (R-Irvine), for standing up for public education in general
and Irvine in particular.</TE>

<HD>EBay Merchants to Gain Access to Health Coverage</HD>
<DH>Insurance: The plan for those making their living on the
site is considered a first in e-commerce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc. said Saturday that it plans to offer health insurance to
its community of small entrepreneurs who make their living auctioning
goods on the Internet and have helped turn the San Jose-based company
into one of the few profitable dot-coms.</LD>
<LD>   The insurance program, to begin in October, is considered a first
in the world of e-commerce--no other major online site provides
subscribers access to group health coverage. On EBay, subscribers pay
to use the Web site as a virtual storefront to display and sell their
wares. "We are getting more and more people--husband and wife teams,
extended families, groups of women--who have left their jobs to sell
full time and don't have access to insurance," said company President
Meg Whitman on Saturday. She announced the program to rapturous
applause during EBay Live--the company's first convention for sellers
and buyers--at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   The plan could also help EBay ease brewing dissent from its core
merchant base of individuals and mom-and-pop operations that have to
compete with corporations such as Walt Disney Co. and IBM that also
auction products on the site.</LD>
<TE>   The plan will be available to EBay merchants who gross at least
$1,000 a month in sales. This level has been reached by at least
80,000, according to the company. The subscribers sell everything
from used cars and Persian carpets to comic books and fine--even not
so fine--antiques.</TE>
<TE>   The plan could help EBay retain and build its subscriber base.</TE>
<TE>   "You have someone working in an antique shop without insurance,
and now they can get health coverage, which is not cheap, at a good
rate if they sell on EBay," said e-commerce consultant Lauren
Freedman, president of the Etailing Group in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps people selling on EBay, which of course makes money for
the company," she added. Offering such a program "builds incredible
loyalty. It's very smart."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping their merchants happy was indeed an impetus for EBay to
offer coverage, said company spokesman Kevin Pursglove, who estimated
that small merchants generate 95% of the site's transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to send a message to individual sellers that we
listen to them. We want them to stay on EBay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "[EBay] seems to be paying more attention to the big businesses
these days," said Brian Anderson, 34, who traveled to the Anaheim
convention from Olathe, Kan. He uses EBay to auction items from his
family's pawnshop.</TE>
<TE>   The company will not be contributing to the insurance plan,
however, which will be structured similarly to those offered by
alumni organizations and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Pursglove said the number of subscribers who will be eligible has
not yet been determined, but about 150,000 subscribers consider
selling on EBay to be their full-time jobs, according to a survey the
company conducted earlier this year. At least 80,000 gross $2,000 or
more a month and are in good standing.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to pool together our numbers and get some pretty
good rates," said Whitman. The rates, under the program negotiated
with Physicians Mutual Insurance Co., will not be formally announced
for another month, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Mention of the plan drew the loudest applause of Whitman's keynote
speech. The weekend convention drew about 4,000 EBay buyers and
sellers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dream come true," said Larry Bennett, who left his
full-time job at a ball-bearing factory in Grand Rapids, Mich., 16
months ago to sell camping equipment on EBay. "I'm a stay-at-home dad
now, and my wife kept her factory job for the insurance. Now maybe
she can quit." He and his wife chose to celebrate their fifth
anniversary by attending the convention.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time merchants such as Bennett were clearly the stars of the
gathering in the eyes of EBay and were feted with dinners and other
events, in some cases even having their travel expenses covered.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Young has completed 10,000 transactions and has had
consistently positive feedback from buyers of her goods, which puts
her in an elite tier of EBay merchants. The company flew her from
Crawfordsville, Ind., to attend the convention, which continues
today.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the prospect of group insurance as "awesome," she said
it would be particularly good for her and her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Young started on the site in 1997, selling "obsolete, used
software that was just junk" and eventually began an EBay-only
packing supply business. She figured that people who used the site
would have a great need for boxes, tape, bubble wrap and packing
peanuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a warehouse that we just expanded and an office,"
said Young, 43. Her husband quit his job to become her partner in the
business. "Then we had to get insurance ourselves, and that means
high rates."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the full-time sellers said they were in it for the long
run, even given the uncertainties of the online world. EBay has
remained healthy--Whitman said the company will host $12 billion in
transactions this year and make a profit of $1 billion from fees and
commissions. But other auction sites by major online players such as
Amazon.com and Yahoo have almost faded from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   This did not faze Ronald Hoffman, 43, of Anaheim, who began on
EBay selling Beanie Babies and moved on to general collectibles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a fad," said Hoffman, who left his restaurant
business to devote 14 hours a day to EBay. "People are always going
to buy. It's what America is based on."</TE>
<TE>   He did admit to some auction gaffes. "I bought 5,000 collectibles
about those boy bands," he said. "I sold 4,000 of them and got stuck
with the rest."</TE>
<TE>   And what about those leftovers?</TE>
<TE>   "They make great gifts," he said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yissel Barajas grew up in a farm-worker haven, but it wasn't until
she started pursuing her master's degree at UCLA that she learned
that the lemon pickers of Cabrillo Village practically invented the
term self-help housing.</LD>
<LD>   In her coursework on urban planning was a chapter on the birth of
the east Ventura community, a testament to the period nearly three
decades ago when laborers--their grower-owned shanties condemned by
health officials--stood arm in arm to block an army of bulldozers
intent on knocking their houses flat.</LD>
<LD>   What happened next was a textbook case of affordable-housing
activism.</LD>
<TE>   Together, the villagers raised $80,000--$1,000 from each of the
original families, including Barajas' parents--to purchase their land
and formed a cooperative that today owns the entire community at the
edge of the Santa Clara farming valley.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed to have been the first time in the nation's history
that Mexican American farm workers rallied to collectively buy their
homes from a grower. And it helped inspire Barajas to continue in
that tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old newlywed is the newest project manager for the
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., the association formed in 1975
to pluck the old labor camp from the brink of demolition and
transform it into a pioneering housing cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   She will oversee two projects to provide the first large-scale
farm-worker housing built in Ventura County in nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I know better than most exactly what these kinds of housing
opportunities mean to farm workers," said Barajas, whose parents
still live in the Latino community, now made up of stucco homes and
peach-colored apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how hard these laborers work, and I know they deserve
decent housing," she said. "It's exciting to be able to give somebody
the same opportunities I had."</TE>
<TE>   Her timing couldn't be better.</TE>
<TE>   With skyrocketing housing prices and soaring rents making it
tougher than ever for agricultural workers to find affordable places
to live, growers, labor advocates and elected leaders are in the
midst of an unprecedented campaign to shelter those who supply the
muscle for the county's $1-billion farm industry.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts could receive a boost this fall, when California
voters weigh in on a $2.1-billion housing bond that would funnel $200
million into the state's primary farm-worker housing grant program.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the money would become available at a time of
increased local attention to rural housing conditions, spurred in
part by a growing belief that in order to keep farmers in business,
steps must be taken to house those who work the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anyone [other than Barajas] in a better position
to help farm workers find housing," said Rodney Fernandez, executive
director of Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., the
county's largest private developer of low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a person who could have gone anywhere and done anything
she wanted," Fernandez said. "Yet she decides to come back and give
back to her community."</TE>
<TE>   Barajas wasn't sure at first she had found her calling.</TE>
<TE>   Although born in Ventura about the time her parents were staring
down bulldozers, she was raised in Mexico from about age 5. By the
time the family returned to Cabrillo Village for good, she was 12 and
settling into a community that had been utterly transformed.</TE>
<TE>   From a 1930s-era farm labor camp had sprung a bustling community
complete with a church, market, laundry room, community center,
library and playground. State grants helped families refurbish
existing homes and build adjacent apartment complexes.</TE>
<TE>   The farm-worker struggle and subsequent successes captured
national attention and were the subject of a TV documentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to have had the luxury of having a house, when so many
families are struggling to put a roof over their heads, I think
helped me in getting an education," said Barajas, the oldest of four
children. "It meant I didn't have to stop school and go to work to
help support my family."</TE>
<TE>   She earned her bachelor's degree in political science from UCLA in
1995 and, after a year off from school, returned to pursue a master's
degree in urban planning. She took a particular interest in community
development work.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Estrada, a UCLA demographer and professor of urban planning,
said he believes the turning point came when Barajas enrolled in a
class on nonprofit housing development.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when her intellectual, social and personal passions
all came together around the topic of affordable housing," Estrada
said. "Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. is a place that is
allowing her to develop into a young professional, to practice her
craft and to channel her passions for housing and justice."</TE>
<TE>   Barajas went to work in 1998 for a nonprofit housing developer in
Los Angeles and landed the Cabrillo job late last year after she and
her husband of one month, Ventura engineer Jaime Fernandez, found a
home in Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Barajas' projects cover familiar territory.</TE>
<TE>   She will oversee construction of 54 rental units, specifically
targeted to farm workers, near the River Ridge Golf Course in north
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   And she has inherited a project in south Oxnard, where Cabrillo is
preparing to raze a 1930s-era collection of shacks and replace them
with single-family homes and apartments exclusively for farm workers
and dedicated to the late labor leader Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   As with the fight at Cabrillo Village, the south Oxnard project
was made possible after former tenants won a three-year legal battle
over the slum conditions that had existed at the property.</TE>
<TE>   Those similarities have not gone unnoticed, especially by her
pioneering parents, Olga and Ramiro Barajas.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very proud of her," her mother said, "because she is
helping families who are in the same situation we were in."</TE>

<HD>Silas Trim Bissell, 60; Spent Years as a Fugitive After
Bombing Attempt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Silas Trim Bissell, the scion of a carpet sweeper fortune who became
a bomb-toting 1960s radical and lived as a fugitive for 17 years,
died June 15 of brain cancer at his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Bissell's great-grandfather founded the Grand Rapids, Mich.,
company whose name is synonymous with carpet-cleaning machines. But
he turned his back on the family business, as his father had before
him. He was a college professor and lauded poet when the social and
political convulsions of the 1960s swept him into the revolutionary
group known as the Weathermen and a place on the FBI's most-wanted
list.</LD>
<LD>   He had a comfortable childhood as the son of socially conscious
parents. His father, Wadsworth, was an artist who was disinherited
for refusing to join the family enterprise. His mother, Hillary, was
a lifelong civil rights activist who helped start a chapter of the
Congress of Racial Equality. She and her husband were honored with a
special award from the NAACP in 1960.</LD>
<TE>   Bissell attended the University of Michigan, where he won three
prestigious Hopwood Awards for his poetry. He fell in love with
Judith Emily Siff, a New Yorker whom he would later marry. But he was
the least politically inclined member of his family. When he finally
was jailed during his senior year for taking part in a civil rights
sit-in, his mother exclaimed, "Thank God! I thought you never were
going to get arrested."</TE>
<TE>   The scholarly life appealed to him more. He graduated in 1964 with
a bachelor's degree in English literature and went on to Syracuse
University for a master's in creative writing in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the next three years teaching at Wayne State University
in Detroit, but the temper of the times made it impossible to avoid
politics. Issues of race, authority and the legitimacy of America's
involvement in southeast Asia were turning campuses across the
country into smelters of unrest.</TE>
<TE>   During the Detroit riots in 1967, Bissell and his wife decided it
was "time to stop being spectators" and take their concern to the
streets. Ending the Vietnam war became their mission.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, he gave up his tenure-track teaching job and the couple
moved to Seattle, the center of a vigorous anti-war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving the summer that Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King
Jr. were assassinated and protesters stormed Chicago during the 1968
Democratic National Convention, they joined a Seattle draft
resistance group.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually they were drawn to an organization that borrowed its
name from a line by Bob Dylan: "You don't need a weatherman to know
which way the wind blows."</TE>
<TE>   As a married couple in a fringe culture that scorned monogamy as
too bourgeois, the Bissells were constantly challenged by comrades in
the Weathermen collective to prove their dedication to the cause.
Their chance came in the early hours of Jan. 17, 1970, after a
Weathermen leader asked them to "do a bombing" in conjunction with an
appearance by Yippies co-founder Jerry Rubin at the University of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   They placed a paper bag containing a home-made incendiary device
under the steps of the campus ROTC building. It did not go off,
apparently because of a defective wire. The Bissells were caught by
campus police almost immediately, leading them to suspect they had
been set up by compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   They posted $50,000 in bonds and planned to face trial in Seattle
until, according to Bissell, leading Weatherman Mark Rudd urged them
to go underground. Traveling by bus and train, they made their way to
San Francisco, but were rebuffed by fellow Weathermen. They wound up
in Boston, where the mounting pressures finally destroyed the
Bissells' marriage. They parted at the end of 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Bissell was apprehended first and given a three-year
sentence. She was released in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Alone and on the run, Bissell was desperately unhappy. Surviving
on a monthly allowance an intermediary brought from his parents, he
moved anonymously from city to city, walking for miles every day
because "I didn't know what do with myself."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he realized that there was "no point in evading arrest
if that's all you do with your life."</TE>
<TE>   He adopted the most boring name he could think of, Terrence Peter
Jackson, and made a new life in Eugene, Ore., a college town where
the inside joke is that old hippies never die--they just move to
Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   He gradually developed a strategy for his life in hiding, which he
once summed up as "wear a red hat if you don't want to be noticed."</TE>
<TE>   He worked in food co-ops, painted and learned to play the fiddle.
A job as a nurse's aide sent him back to school: He earned a
bachelor's in biology from North Carolina Central University in 1979
and a master's in physical therapy from Duke University.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he returned to Eugene and went to work as a physical
therapist.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 29, 1987, a knock at the door ended his charade. FBI
agents arrested him, saying they acted on an anonymous tip from
someone who saw his picture on a wanted poster. Bissell believed he
had been betrayed by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 letters were written on his behalf, and four friends
put up their homes to cover a $95,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to two years in prison by a federal judge who
said he did not believe "that a person deserves extra special
treatment because he had been a model fugitive." He served 17 months
in the federal penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif., and was released in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   While behind bars, he married schoolteacher Ruth Evan, who had
known him in high school in Grand Rapids and corresponded with him in
prison. She survives him, along with three stepchildren and two
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition of his release, Bissell performed community service
in Cleveland. Then he moved with Evan back to Eugene, where he
devoted himself to sculpture and painting in a fauvist style. He
achieved some commercial success, showing in several West Coast
galleries.</TE>
<TE>   He used most of the proceeds from the sale of his art to fund
human rights work. In 1993, he founded the Campaign for Labor Rights,
a national organization opposed to sweatshop conditions in factories
around the world, and served for several years as national director.</TE>
<TE>   Although partially paralyzed as a result of special chemotherapy
for the cancer that was diagnosed in late 2000, he continued to work
as an artist until shortly before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Asked some years ago about his previous life as a dangerous
radical, he said that he no longer believed in violence. But he was
miffed by suggestions that becoming a physical therapist and artist
had made him "reformed ... some kind of spiritual person." He
remained unapologetic about the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the best I knew how to do to stop a horrible atrocity in
southeast Asia," he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1992. "I
no longer have strong feelings about whether it was right to use the
means I did; I simply don't know anymore. But I gave it my best shot
and I have no apologies for that. I do believe that what I did
contributed in a small way to ending the war."</TE>

<HD>Chumash Sites Exposed to New Risks</HD>
<DH>Heritage: Archeologists and law enforcement officers team
up after wildfire to protect artifacts from looting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep in the Sespe Wilderness north of Ojai, archeologist Steve
Galbraith knelt on the scorched earth and wiped clean a cutting stone
he'd plucked from the bush.</LD>
<LD>   As he examined the Chumash Indian artifact, several questions came
to mind. Who fashioned this prehistoric cooking tool? Was it 2,000 or
3,000 years old? What other treasures lay hidden in the clay soil?</LD>
<LD>   And perhaps most important: How could he keep such valuables out
of the hands of thieves who prey on Native American archeological
sites?</LD>
<TE>   With predictions that Southern California's wildfire season could
be among its worst ever, archeologists, park rangers and law
enforcement officers are bracing for the expected return of looters
who see opportunity and riches amid the ash.</TE>
<TE>   "They are stealing from everyone," Galbraith said, as he stepped
gingerly through waist-high chaparral searching for tools,
arrowheads, bowls and other Chumash remnants that may have surfaced
in the wake of the Wolf fire in Los Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of our American heritage and part of our American
culture," he said of the ancient burial grounds. "It's who we are."</TE>
<TE>   Galbraith and fellow archeologist Janine McFarland will spend a
few weeks combing through the forest to assess damage to the sites,
rock paintings and artifacts that may have been in the path of the
23,000-acre wildfire, which was contained June 14. Across Southern
California, nearly 74,000 acres of wilderness have burned this year,
exposing canyons and hillsides that had been covered by trees and
thick brush, some for hundreds of years. More than 22,000 federally
protected sites within the region contain the remnants of Native
American life going back 10,000 years or more, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Park rangers and law enforcement authorities are stepping up
patrols and education programs directed at hikers and campers to warn
them about the fines and penalties associated with pilfering. Theft
of Native American relics and desecration of federally protected
sites are both punishable by a maximum fine of $250,000 and up to two
years in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Looters do take a forest fire as an opportunity to discover
archeological areas because the brush that would hide them is gone,"
said Joseph Johns, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who
specializes in investigating environmental crimes. "We want people to
know we're going to be out looking for them."</TE>
<TE>   Johns said a task force of federal, state and local law
enforcement officials recently began holding strategy meetings to
devise new ways to catch looters. One plan calls for installing
sensors at sites that would alert law enforcement officers if someone
enters the area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rare arrowheads, skulls, bones, baskets and other relics can bring
tens of thousands of dollars from collectors, officials said. Some
looters carve out rock art. Others use special equipment for probing
beneath the earth's surface for buried pots and utensils.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue that we take seriously because they are not just
stealing from the [national forest], they are destroying a page out
of a history book that can never be replaced," said Todd Swain, a
special agent for the National Park Service whose patrol area
includes Channel Islands National Park, Mojave Desert, Arizona and
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are very sophisticated and they know where to go to look for
stuff and they know its value. These people aren't Osama bin Laden,
but these things need to be protected."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Lopez, a member of the elders council of the Barbareno
Chumash Council in Santa Barbara, said greed and disrespect drive
most thieves. He said looting has become a major problem in
California and the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to articulate the grief and anger," Lopez
said. "People don't understand to leave [artifacts] alone. It's not
your property. If I find something in your house, I leave it."</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Barbara woman was convicted last year of paying a
contractor to dig up an ancient Chumash village along the Santa Ynez
River in Los Padres National Forest so she could move her cabin
there. She is scheduled to be sentenced July 8.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai resident Jaret Owens was detained in a federal grave-robbing
investigation on Santa Cruz Island in 1997, although he was never
charged. Federal agents raided his home and confiscated Chumash
artifacts that he and his father had collected.</TE>
<TE>   The items were returned to Owens, 52, who said that he never sold
artifacts for profit and that the pieces were collected before the
Archeological Resources Protection Act was passed in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "Protect yourself from the claws of the park service and don't
pick anything up," he said.Meanwhile, archeologists continue to scour
the charred wilderness in Ventura County, looking to recover
artifacts and checking for damage. Ancient rock art--which includes
depictions of day-to-day life among the Chumash--sustained soot and
smoke damage, said Joan Brandoff-Kerr, chief archeologist for Los
Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Brandoff-Kerr said surveys completed in the next few weeks should
provide information on artifact damage, previously unknown rock
drawings and other relics uncovered by the recent fire. The survey
also will determine the sites most vulnerable to looters, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some pretty spectacular rock art out there," she said.
"I'm very concerned because we know the people that do this and they
know what they are doing. The people that would buy this stuff in the
black market are just as bad as the people who take it. It's a dirty
business."</TE>

<HD>Animal-Rights Measure Gains in Surf City</HD>
<DH>Cruelty: Circuses oppose growing nationwide move to ban
certain wild-animal acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though a circus hasn't rolled through town in years, Huntington Beach
is poised to join a growing list of cities that have outlawed the use
of wild animals in circus acts and even pony rides.</LD>
<LD>   A grass-roots campaign by animal-rights activists has spurred more
than 20 cities nationwide, including Pasadena and San Diego County's
Encinitas, to pass similar ordinances in recent months, angering
circus officials who believe the laws unfairly single them out.</LD>
<LD>   "We refer to the ordinances as a solution in search of a problem,"
said Heidi Herriott of the Outdoor Amusement Business Assn. in
Florida, which represents traveling circuses and carnivals.</LD>
<TE>   Animal-rights activists say that by limiting the places where
animals can be displayed, they can reduce what they see as the
inhumane exploitation of the creatures.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinances generally exclude zoos and other facilities
sanctioned by the American Zoological Assn., animal shelters and
sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   They ban circus animals, pony rides and other events.</TE>
<TE>   "It would apply to any display of animals used for entertainment
purposes," said Karen Chepeka, an animal-rights activist pushing the
measure in Huntington Beach. "There's a huge difference between
education and entertainment displays, like having an elephant or lion
do tricks--that's not normal behavior for a wild animal."</TE>
<TE>   Citing what they believe is lax enforcement of federal and state
standards for treatment of circus animals, activists hope to shift
that job to city police officers. Armed with local laws, police would
be empowered to protect people from wild animals and wild animals
from mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulation "just doesn't protect them enough," said Nicole
Paquette, general counsel for the Sacramento-based Animal Protection
Institute, which drew up the model ordinance that most local
activists are pushing through city councils. "The one [federal]
requirement for a cage is that [animals] have to be able to stand up
and turn around. It's sad that these animals spend the majority of
their time traveling in boxcars."</TE>
<TE>   Circus backers see the ordinances as part of a larger
animal-rights campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Their true agenda is being uncovered," Herriott said. "Their true
agenda is no medical research utilizing animals, no fur, no leather."</TE>
<TE>   Ordinance backers acknowledge that they are waging a grass-roots
campaign to create zones where animals cannot be used for
entertainment, much like the nuclear-free-zone ordinances that were
in vogue in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Circus officials see it as a stealth campaign in which
animal-rights activists quietly approach cities and try to get
ordinances passed before opposition can mobilize.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear they're trying to gain momentum, and we think it's
important to stop it now," said Catherine Ort-Mabry, spokeswoman for
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, based in Vienna, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unnecessary legislation," she said. "It's ideologically
driven. The folks pushing this believe animals should be removed from
circuses. They're trying to tell people what to eat, what to wear and
how to spend their free time."</TE>
<TE>   The potential effect of the ordinances is unclear. Huntington
Beach, for example, hasn't hosted a circus in years. Yet circus
operators are concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of heartbreaking that these animal-rights people are
making decisions for families who want to be entertained by circuses
with animals," said Alexis Kaiser, booking manager agent for Circus
Vargas, the Lucerne Valley, Calif.-based circus that tours Southern
and Central California, and has performed in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "City officials are listening to these types of people and
allowing them to make decisions for their community as a whole,"
Kaiser said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook said she was impressed with a
presentation by local animal-rights activists and agreed to back the
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is watch their videotape and see how some of
these circus animals are treated, and you can't help but support it,"
said Cook, who voted Monday to have the city attorney review a
proposed ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Green, a council colleague, opposed considering the measure,
in part because he said it would add duties to an already
overburdened staff that could shrink by 5% in coming months because
of budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was frivolous and quite unnecessary," he said. "We
should concentrate on the major reasons for a city council to be
here: public safety."</TE>

<HD>Sandy Cohen, 61; Key Supporter of Cancer Institute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandy Cohen, a co-founder and active participant in the John Wayne
Cancer Institute Auxiliary at St. John's Health Center, died Friday
of ovarian cancer at the Santa Monica hospital. She was 61.</LD>
<LD>   A long-term survivor of breast cancer, Cohen was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer last year.</LD>
<LD>   "Sandy was a woman of great strength and courage who did so much
for cancer patients at the John Wayne Cancer Institute," said Dr.
Armando Giuliano, chief of surgical oncology at the institute and
director of its Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center. "She had such a
great, uplifting spirit."</LD>
<TE>   Cohen was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 1982, and underwent
a mastectomy and reconstruction at the institute when it was based at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Her cancer in remission, she wanted to give something back to
women facing the same health crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Noreen Nelson, another breast cancer survivor, Cohen
gathered a number of friends and formed the auxiliary, which became
the institute's fund-raising and volunteer arm. It has nearly 1,000
members and has generated more than $10 million for the institute.</TE>
<TE>   The auxiliary raises money in a variety of ways, most notably its
annual Odyssey Ball, a gala black tie dinner-dance and auction that
this year netted more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen had served as president of the auxiliary and remained an
active member of the board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   But her activism went beyond fund-raising and committee work. She
volunteered regularly at the Keefer Center, counseling women facing
breast surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Born in St. Louis, Cohen later moved to Los Angeles, where she met
her husband, Irving A. Cohen, an insurance executive. They were
married in 1963. He survives her, as do her daughters, Teddi
Gilderman and Amy Minda Cohen; and two grandchildren, Ryan and Hope
Gilderman.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made in
Cohen's honor to the John Wayne Cancer Institute Auxiliary, 2200
Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 131, Santa Monica, CA 90404.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 3 p.m. Monday at Hillside Memorial Park
in Culver City.</TE>

<HD>Their Graduation Comes With Fear</HD>
<DH>Education: Disabled adults leave special programs for a
world of uncertainty.</DH>

<LD>His brain locked in infancy, Andrew Thomas tore off his graduation
gown and crawled to his mother's knees--a shaky start to his first
day of adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas, 22, who is autistic and retarded, was one of eight
students to graduate last week from the Speech and Language
Development Center in Buena Park, a private school for students from
infancy to 22 with multiple disabilities and behavior problems.</LD>
<LD>   He spent most of the ceremony lying by his mother, who stroked his
dark hair as she worried about his future, since his erratic behavior
prevents him from working or joining most programs for disabled
adults.</LD>
<TE>   Graduation isn't always a time to celebrate. For people with
disabilities, graduation often marks a frightening time, an emergence
from sheltered programs that provided as much specialized help as
they needed to a future with limited possibilities and even fewer
places to go.</TE>
<TE>   When they turn 22, the legal right to a free, appropriate
education expires under the federal Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, passed in 1975 to bring the nation's disabled children
out of institutions and into schools.</TE>
<TE>   "All the systems tell them that they're adults, but they're not,"
said Sandra Sternig-Babcock, executive director of the Dubnoff
Center, a North Hollywood school for the disabled. "There's this
gaping hole out there in services for these people who are youngsters
in every way but actual age."</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't money, since the state's Department of
Developmental Services arranges funding for adults with substantial
developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and autism, to
join appropriate groups or programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the lack of programs for the range of
disabilities," said Dawn O'Connell, program director at the Speech
and Language Development Center. "There are people who would pay out
of their own pockets for good programs, if only they could find
them."</TE>
<TE>   Many programs offer little more than the equivalent of
baby-sitting, perhaps taking students on field trips to the library
or mall, said Christa Baysa of Cerritos, whose daughter, Christy,
graduated from Speech and Language last year.</TE>
<TE>   Now 23, her physically and verbally disabled daughter is in a
Cypress College independent-living program that teaches academic
subjects as well as cooking and grocery-shopping skills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous to sit nonreaders down in a library to do
nothing, just to have a place to put them for a few hours," Baysa
said. "I see better things for my daughter than sitting around
killing time."</TE>
<TE>   Baysa hopes her daughter will find a job that uses her abilities
but isn't beyond her grasp. While in school she had such jobs, for
example, stocking clothes at Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Social Skills</TE>
<TE>   More challenging than finding a job is making employers understand
when their disabled employees lack social skills, said O'Connell.
"Employers feel they can teach our students to do the work, but that
it's our duty to teach them how to be employees," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And some employers will reject them anyway because they appear so
physically disabled, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A string of dismissals from department and grocery stores sent
John Anchando, now 31, back to the Speech and Language Development
Center a year after he graduated in 1989. For the last 12 years, he
has worked there as a teaching assistant. At the center, others
understand his attention deficit disorder and diabetes complications,
and the work is more productive than going to a recreational program
each day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still really scared of what's out there," the Whittier man
said. "Being disabled and all that, the transition has been a lot
more challenging than I expected."</TE>
<TE>   For those who aren't hired or are incapable of holding a job,
group homes, day programs and institutions are the usual options.
However, those programs and places can be a shock to people used to
the sheltering environment of a school like the development center,
where turnover is low and one-to-one aides are commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   The school's warmth and accepting attitudes were evident at the
recent graduation.</TE>
<TE>   A video that showed a student's attempt--albeit a failed one--at a
basketball shot drew loud applause, and one graduate triggered gentle
laughter when he haltingly thanked a teacher for "help with my
swearing and my science project."</TE>
<TE>   For parents like Lydia Castro, whose daughter, Brianne, will
graduate next year, the school's success had given them false hope
for future placements.</TE>
<TE>   "I was living in an imaginary world when I thought we could find
another environment like that," said Castro, of Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   In many adult programs, whose budgets ebb and flow with the
economy, low pay and unstable funding often mean a revolving door of
poorly trained personnel, O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time they start setting up relationships with each other,
the employees are off to something else that pays better," she said.
"It's not their fault, but they get burned out."</TE>
<TE>   A 'Double Whammy'</TE>
<TE>   That instability in caretakers scares Castro, whose 21-year-old
daughter has the mental capacity of a toddler and requires constant
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a double whammy because my daughter has no way of defending
herself against anything," she said. "We're pretty limited as to what
kind of environment we can choose."</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been made since the mid-1980s, when a nationwide
survey found a "severe discrepancy" between existing programs and the
needs of disabled adults.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, programs for the disabled have made a greater effort
to create job opportunities, said Nancy Reder, deputy executive
director of the Assn. of State Directors of Special Education.</TE>
<TE>   "People understand better now that sheltered workshops aren't good
futures," she said. "They're looking to help people actually be
productive members of society."</TE>
<TE>   Although most parents said they want to involve their children in
deciding their futures, their lack of communication skills sometimes
makes it difficult. Most of the students who recently graduated from
the development center cannot speak.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Salazar Jr., who stuffed his fingers in his ears when he
heard the crowd's applause, will join a program that teaches computer
skills.</TE>
<TE>   His parents' struggles with the bureaucracy of arranging their
autistic son's care are aggravated because they speak only Spanish
and he doesn't speak at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heartbreaking when you don't know if your decisions are
making your baby happy," said Margarita Salazar, of Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Thomas' mother, Janet, explored dozens of programs before
finding one she hopes will make her son happy.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows things are changing, but he can't understand why," said
Thomas, of Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's anxious, and it's hard on the family to see him so fretful.
We can only hope the new place even remotely approaches what this
place does for him."</TE>

<HD>Chain Reaction of Thirst in California Desert Dry Spell</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Scores of plant and animal species are suffering
in the longest drought on record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Antelope Valley Poppy Preserve closed a month early, with a
funereal-looking black-bordered announcement on its Web site. With no
poppies in bloom, the season was dead.</LD>
<LD>   The worst ever recorded 12-month dry spell across California's 25
million acres of desert, from Death Valley to the Mexican border, has
set off an ecological chain reaction of hunger, thirst and
deprivation for scores of plant and animal species.</LD>
<LD>   "Drought shrivels the supply of food for local wildlife," said
Dennis Schramm, assistant manager of the East Mojave National
Preserve. "This is the driest year in 100 years."</LD>
<TE>   Forget the wildflowers of spring that never arrived. Creosote and
other hardy native plants are now in a state of indefinite wilt,
their leaves curled up tight to conserve every drop of moisture.
Burro bushes stand sere and brown. They never bothered to grow new
leaves. Robbed of their nutritious spring greens, imperiled tortoises
and lizards are not breeding, instead hunkering underground in a
state of suspended animation, trying to stay cool and conserve body
fluids.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no movement out there," said Jason Sexton, assistant
director of the Granite Mountains Desert Research Center in the
Mojave preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Although people tend to think of the area as an arid wasteland--it
is the desert, after all--scores of species get by on the 3 to 9
inches of rain that usually fall from July through November. Since
July of last year, however, some places have seen as little as a
quarter of an inch.</TE>
<TE>   Rare fringe-toed lizards at the Coachella Valley Preserve are
burrowing deep in sand dunes, taking a break from their annual mating
in favor of trying to survive. Half the population can die off in a
dry year, according to Cameron Barrows, a biologist who runs the
preserve. That wouldn't wipe out the species, but because they avoid
reproduction during a drought, more dry years could cripple comeback
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Barrows and other scientists said lack of food, which is normally
coaxed into bloom by the rains, is as serious an issue as a dearth of
drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   The lizards "have to get nice and fat to produce the nutrients
needed for egg clutches," said Barrows.</TE>
<TE>   This year, much of their annual diet of spring wildflowers and the
insects that go with them never bloomed or hatched out. Consequently,
the lizards' fare is limited to less nutritious beetles and other
bugs that feed on decaying plants. That is not the stuff of romance
for fringe-toed lizards.</TE>
<TE>   "They really depend on that flush of nutrients to stimulate them,"
Barrows said.</TE>
<TE>   With so many animals underground, researchers who flock to desert
study centers were disappointed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to four different springs, and they were all dry," said
Ken Nagy, a UCLA biology professor who made his annual pilgrimage
with 13 students in late May to the Granite Mountains research center
in the Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   One form of life that is more visible is the raptor, which
normally feeds off carrion on area roads and the desert floor. With
their prey hiding underground, the birds are forced to work harder to
find food.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely seeing a decrease in road kill," said Sexton.
"We're seeing predators such as ravens and scrub jays basically
scouring the desert looking very desperate. Our ravens are now
hanging out around our dumpsters."</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers from as far away as Pasadena are trucking water out to
more than 40 underground tanks spread across the Mojave. Informally
known as "guzzlers," they release small amounts of drinking water
through drip pipes that wildlife--from bighorn sheep to kangaroo
rats--have come to depend on.</TE>
<TE>   Mojave preserve officials have been considering abandoning the
guzzlers in future years, to try to wean desert creatures of man-made
water sources.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough sell in a drought year, though," said chief ranger
Sean McGuinness.</TE>
<TE>   The guzzlers can be problematic if they are not filled. In past
years, said Sexton, bighorn rams have "gone into a kind of panic" and
busted through the empty tank walls, frantic to find water. One lamb
was found dead after it fell in and got trapped.</TE>
<TE>   Preserve staff members are already removing old bathtubs,
windmills, miles of plastic pipe and other jury-rigged irrigation
systems laid out over several decades by cattle ranchers who are now
selling their lands to the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   There are still 4.8 million acres of desert being grazed,
according to Stephen Razo, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land
Management California Desert district office in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle, like wildlife, do not breed well without the vitamin-rich
fresh alfalfa and other desert grasses they normally graze on each
spring, said Schramm.</TE>
<TE>   Many ranchers are paying to ship in vitamins, protein supplements
and hay for their cattle this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For people who must confront its effects every day, the drought is
downright depressing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mentally hard," said Sexton, whose view outside the Mojave
research center is of blasted, dull brown vegetation. "Normally,
right now it would look like a nice mosaic of greens over the soil,
and there would be all kinds of flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Even the Marines are glum.</TE>
<TE>   "I really miss the flowers," said Capt. Robert Crum, stationed at
the Twentynine Palms base.</TE>
<TE>   Old-timers in the southernmost California deserts have begun to
cast their eyes skyward. With the Sonoran monsoon season set to begin
in Arizona, they are hopeful rain will stray west across the border.
Up to a third of southern desert rains can fall in summer months in a
good monsoon year.</TE>
<TE>   Others are pinning their hopes on winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope El Nino comes along and just drowns us," said Ruth Ann
Thomas of the Antelope Valley Chambers of Commerce.</TE>

<HD>Timothy Findley, 71; Prolific Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timothy Findley, a prolific novelist whose stylistically diverse
writing won him numerous honors in his native Canada, has died. He
was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Findley, who had battled congestive heart failure in recent years,
died Thursday at a hospital in southern France of complications from
a pelvic fracture sustained in a fall at his home.</LD>
<LD>   A diverse writer comfortable in a variety of mediums, Findley was
best known as a novelist. Although he received good critical marks in
the United States, he failed to find the audience here that he did in
his homeland and in Europe. He also was a playwright, memoirist and
short-story author.</LD>
<TE>   His work evaded easy classification but revealed common themes
based on human fears.</TE>
<TE>   "I must admit that I cannot imagine why I have written what I
have," he said some years ago. "It does occur to me, however, that a
thread runs through all my work that has to do with unlikely people
being confronted with uncommon events."</TE>
<TE>   In a biographical portrait, the reference work "Contemporary
Novelists" offered a broader assessment of his literary concerns:</TE>
<TE>   "Although reevaluating history is a preoccupation in his writing,
and although some of his writing has been labeled 'historical
megafiction,' Findley's style changes with each novel. He is a
literary experimenter--with form, with setting, and with
voice--experimenting in the service of social, historical and
political exposition."</TE>
<TE>   Findley was uncomfortable with labels attached to his work, once
telling an interviewer: "I don't think any of my work is within any
given genre.... I just write whatever I write."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Toronto, the son of a well-to-do stockbroker, Findley's
childhood was less than idyllic, growing up with an alcoholic father.
Self-described as "a solitary and dream child," Findley spent much of
his time playing with pets, reading and listening to music. He began
writing as a child, he said, because he was often confined to bed
with a number of illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   But writing wasn't his first choice of vocation--acting was.
Findley abandoned traditional schooling after 10th grade to study
drama in Toronto and London. He made his professional stage debut in
the late 1940s, joined a Shakespeare festival in Stratford, Ontario,
in the early 1950s and worked steadily in productions throughout
Canada and the U.S. for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   As he neared 30, his life took a sharp turn while working in a
touring production of "The Matchmaker" with actress Ruth Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Findley and Gordon went out to view an exhibition of paintings, he
recalled later in an interview with the journal Books, and Gordon
viewed the work--all done by artists in their 20s--as a very bleak
commentary on life.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon's criticism led Findley, who was still in that age group,
to write a short story that had a more optimistic view of life.</TE>
<TE>   He gave the work to Gordon to read, and although she saw the
subject matter as being just as negative as the work in the
exhibition, she loved the writing.</TE>
<TE>   She, in turn, showed the piece to the author of "The Matchmaker,"
Thornton Wilder, and the two of them convinced Findley that his
future was in writing, not the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several decades, Findley became a prolific and
honored writer. He turned out 12 novels, two short-story collections,
two volumes of memoirs and several plays. He also worked in radio and
television, including a stint in Hollywood in the 1960s at CBS
television.</TE>
<TE>   Each of his novels was stylistically diverse. For example, "Not
Wanted on the Voyage" is the retelling of the Noah's Ark story from
Genesis with a view of Noah as a sinister individual. "Famous Last
Words" deals with the life of the poet and fascist Ezra Pound;
"Pilgrim" looks at the insane through a central character who is
determined to commit suicide but isn't quite able to complete the
process.</TE>
<TE>   His novel "The Wars," which won Canada's top literary prize--the
Governor General's Award for fiction--in 1977, contrasts social
struggles in Toronto with the brutality of trench warfare in World
War I. He received a second Governor General's award in 2000 for his
play "Elizabeth Rex."</TE>
<TE>   Findley viewed acting as perhaps the finest training a writer can
have.</TE>
<TE>   "Scene structure, dialogue, rhythm, cadence, language, the
interplay between action and words are notions which I think a lot of
writers lack," Findley told the Toronto Star.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his longtime companion William Whitehead.</TE>

<HD>How Should Garden Grove Grow?</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Should the city raze affordable housing to
make way for revenue-producing hotels and stores? No, say residents
at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Garden Grove corner just south of Disneyland, mammoth hotels are
springing up amid the palm trees. Embassy Suites. Hyatt Regency
Alicante. Crowne Plaza Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   It is hard to distinguish where tourist-haven Anaheim ends and the
city once ridiculed as "Garbage Grove" begins.</LD>
<LD>   The construction is just the start of Garden Grove Mayor Bruce
Broadwater's vision for a remade Harbor Boulevard,--miles of hotels,
restaurants and shops. A Harbor Boulevard that banks on Anaheim's
cash cows--Disneyland and one of the country's largest convention
centers.</LD>
<TE>   But to do that, the city might have to raze as many as 500
single-family homes, 300 mobile homes and 120 apartment units,
pushing close to 1,000 families from their affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have mobilized, hiring consultants and lawyers, holding
community meetings and organizing block captains for door-to-door
campaigns. Lawn signs in front of the endangered homes proclaim:
"United We Stand to Save Our Homes." Dozens of residents are expected
to line up in opposition Tuesday, when the City Council holds a
public hearing to consider the redevelopment plan. The vote will come
at the following council meeting."We're not taking this stuff laying
down," said resident Manny Ballesteros. "We're angry. We're afraid of
losing our homes....To take our homes so that a developer can make
money--that is totally unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to convert 195 acres into a redevelopment zone
illustrates a national issue often raised but never resolved: Is it
right for a cash-strapped city to use redevelopment to stimulate
economic growth, and, if so, at what cost to some of its residents?
The city Planning Commission, which has already approved adding the
redevelopment zone, has suggested that its size be reduced to about
150 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, called "Bulldozer Broadwater" by foes of the project,
feels hard-pressed to come up with alternatives. He calls his city
"the hole in the doughnut."</TE>
<TE>   Of 34 cities in Orange County, Garden Grove is the second poorest,
when measured by revenue per capita, Broadwater said. It is a
working-class, largely residential city of about 165,000.</TE>
<TE>   The city "doesn't have anything," he said. "It doesn't have a
Disneyland or a Westminster Mall or a South Coast Plaza. Everyone
else around us has something.... We have to look at reality. This
city has to look at what it's been given."</TE>
<TE>   And what it's been given is a neighboring city with a major
tourist draw.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Garden Grove officials have cut deals with
developers to make way for 2,000 hotel rooms--in six new hotels and a
major renovation to the Hilton. Three more hotels are planned, said
Matt Fertal, assistant city manager.</TE>
<TE>   City officials gave away the land, valued at $32 million, and are
giving developers about $8,000 per hotel room in tax revenue. In
exchange, they expect to gain about $6 million annually from the new
hotels, money that will go straight to the general fund, Fertal said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say it could be years before residents lose their
homes, if they do at all. And if it happens, the city promises to use
compassion in relocating residents, a pledge that rings hollow with
residents, especially those who don't want to move.</TE>
<TE>   They wonder how the city plans to measure the fair market value of
their home. Some said they will stop planned upgrades and additions.
Others said they would rather move now than live under a threat.</TE>
<TE>   Bob and Mary Ann Walker plan to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Bob stands in his sprawling backyard--a backyard so big he can set
up a volleyball net on summer nights when his extended family gathers
for barbecues.</TE>
<TE>   He proudly gives a tour of the home office he built himself, his
corn patch, his garden overflowing with ripe zucchini, bell peppers,
tomatoes and blackberries. He even has a pen where his chickens yield
about four eggs a day.</TE>
<TE>   When he bought this house 25 years ago, it was an
1,100-square-foot fixer-upper. Now, it's 3,000 square feet and full
of priceless family memories. It is the only home he has ever owned.</TE>
<TE>   "The city doesn't have enough money," Walker said. "You cannot buy
the memories and the sweat my wife and I put in this house. We did
not buy this house to invest, sell it and make a profit. We bought it
to raise a family and retire."</TE>
<TE>   Walker is not opposed to redevelopment. If the city were going to
build a freeway, for example, he might understand. But this plan, he
said, is merely for profit.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent community meeting attended by more than 100 residents,
redevelopment watchdog and Supervisor-elect Chris Norby fired up the
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "All you want is the one thing all Americans have a right to, and
that is to be left alone," said Norby, president of Municipal
Officials for Redevelopment Reform. "Fight for your right and you
will win."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Leyes, who has yet to reveal how he will vote,
said this decision will determine whether the city is willing to
shift directions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a choice. It's a proposal to change our strategy in
redevelopment--to go to economic development rather than
redevelopment," Leyes said. "It's almost like if we could go back in
time and wipe the slate clean, we could reserve these areas for
tourist/commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the city has planned in bits and chunks. It has moved a
few businesses here, a mobile home park there to make way for
commercial development, but the current proposal eclipses those
previous ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose that's where my heartburn comes from," Leyes said. "I'm
not sure it's a good fit for Garden Grove for us to be that
ambitious."</TE>
<TE>   Residents in the proposed redevelopment zone believe their city's
doing just fine as it is. They would like a Borders or a Nordstrom or
a few more restaurants, but say they resent the idea that they're
nothing more than a doughnut hole in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I go to work," said resident Peggy Bergin. "I'm not a celebrity.
I'm a mother of four kids. I've been making house payments for 25
years.... How do we make a life decision with something like this
hanging over our heads?"</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove's Painful Choice: Raze Homes to Boost Tax
Base?</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Mayor's vision is of miles of hotels,
businesses, shops. Residents say no.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Garden Grove corner just south of Disneyland, mammoth hotels are
springing up amid the palm trees. Embassy Suites. Hyatt Regency
Alicante. Crowne Plaza Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   It is hard to distinguish where tourist-haven Anaheim ends and the
city once ridiculed as "Garbage Grove" begins.</LD>
<LD>   The construction is just the start of Garden Grove Mayor Bruce
Broadwater's vision for a remade Harbor Boulevard--miles of hotels,
restaurants and shops. A Harbor Boulevard that banks on Anaheim's
cash cows--Disneyland and one of the country's largest convention
centers.But to do that, the city might have to raze as many as 500
single-family homes, 300 mobile homes and 120 apartment units,
pushing close to 1,000 families from their affordable housing.</LD>
<TE>   Residents have mobilized, hiring consultants and lawyers, holding
community meetings and organizing block captains for door-to-door
campaigns. Signs in front of the endangered homes proclaim: "United
We Stand to Save Our Homes." Dozens of residents are expected to line
up in opposition Tuesday, when the City Council holds a public
hearing to consider the redevelopment plan. The vote will come at the
following council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not taking this stuff laying down," said resident Manny
Ballesteros. "We're angry. We're afraid of losing our homes....To
take our homes so that a developer can make money--that is totally
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to convert 195 acres into a redevelopment zone
illustrates a national issue often raised but never resolved: Is it
right for a cash-strapped city to use redevelopment to stimulate
economic growth, and, if so, at what cost to some of its residents?
The city Planning Commission, which has approved adding the
redevelopment zone, has suggested it be reduced to about 150 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, called "Bulldozer Broadwater" by foes of the project,
feels hard-pressed to come up with alternatives. He calls his city
"the hole in the doughnut."</TE>
<TE>   Of 34 cities in Orange County, Garden Grove is the second poorest,
when measured by revenue per capita, Broadwater said. It is a
working-class, largely residential city of about 165,000.</TE>
<TE>   The city "doesn't have anything," he said. "It doesn't have a
Disneyland or a Westminster Mall or a South Coast Plaza. Everyone
else around us has something.... We have to look at reality. This
city has to look at what it's been given."</TE>
<TE>   And what it's been given is a neighboring city with a major
tourist draw.</TE>

<TE>   In exchange, they expect to gain about $6 million annually from
the new hotels, money that will go straight to the general fund,
Fertal said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it could be hotels all the way from the Fullerton city
line to the 22 Freeway," Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say it could be years before residents lose their
homes. And if it happens, the city promises to use compassion in
relocating residents, a pledge that rings hollow with residents,
especially those who don't want to move.</TE>
<TE>   They wonder how the city plans to measure the fair market value of

<HD>Director Helps Food Bank, as It Helped Her</HD>
<DH>Gina Mirabella, once a client of MEND agency, now oversees
its serving of 30,000 hungry people in Pacoima every month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gina Mirabella was broke, hungry and living in a garage nearly 15
years ago when she first stood in line for a box of donated groceries
at a Pacoima food bank. Today, she runs the same food bank where she
once sought help.</LD>
<LD>   Mirabella, who oversees three paid staff members and 70 volunteers
who give away about 170,000 pounds of food to 30,000 hungry people
each month, said her efforts are her way of giving thanks to the
agency that helped her "get back on her feet."</LD>
<LD>   "Gina's story is a wonderful example of how individuals come to
MEND with close to nothing, and slowly make life-changing moves to
become an asset to not only an organization, but to the community it
serves," said Marianne Haver Hill, the agency's executive director.</LD>
<TE>   MEND, the nonprofit agency that runs the food bank, acknowledged
Mirabella's work recently by naming a remodeled training kitchen
after her and her husband, Joe Mirabella, also a longtime agency
volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   An energetic woman in her 50s, Mirabella doesn't pass judgment on
those who seek help, knowing first-hand that hard times can fall on
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lithuania, the former Gina Leita and her parents fled to
Germany during World War II. The elder Leitas were killed in a
bombing raid, leaving their 5-year-old daughter to be raised in a
series of Roman Catholic orphanages until she was 17.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything changed all the time," Mirabella said. "I was
constantly moving from town to town. I never developed a relationship
with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "People remember their kindergarten teachers or the kids they grew
up with. I don't have any of those memories."</TE>
<TE>   Despite intense loneliness and frequent nightmares, Mirabella
managed to do well in school, especially in math and science. She won
a scholarship from the German government to study pre-medicine at
Temple University in Philadelphia in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   After a few courses, however, Mirabella realized she wasn't cut
out to be a doctor and transferred to Ohio State University intending
to study nursing. It was there that she met her first husband, and
they moved to California in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   The couple established a lucrative real estate business, which
provided them with a home in Palos Verdes Estates, sports cars and a
boat. After their two sons grew up, the couple decided to invest in a
farm in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But they knew nothing of farming and their adventure fell apart.
They lost everything. Soon the marriage broke up.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced and struggling emotionally, Mirabella lived out of her
car and begged for food and money. "I lost all of my self-esteem,"
she said. "My sons didn't know my whereabouts. I just disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Mirabella drove to Los Angeles in 1988 to look up a friend in the
San Fernando Valley. The friend invited her to a storefront church in
North Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "After the service, I met with the minister and told him my
problems," she said. "He let me stay in his garage. He even built a
loft up above so I could sleep there."</TE>
<TE>   The minister told Mirabella about a place called MEND where she
could get food and clothes. At the time, MEND was a storefront
operation on Van Nuys Boulevard. Hungry people lined up outside,
filled out applications, were interviewed and, if approved, returned
later for a box of food.</TE>
<TE>   Mirabella was ashamed of her circumstances, she said, having
fallen so far from prosperity into poverty. Yet, MEND workers were
sympathetic and understanding. In many ways, they lived up to the
group's name, which stands for Meet Each Need with Dignity.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very concerned about me," she recalled. "They almost
immediately sent a home visitor to see my living conditions. They
wanted to see if I needed help with clothing and shoes. MEND looked
at my total needs."</TE>
<TE>   To show her appreciation, Mirabella volunteered at the food bank
during the day while she worked the graveyard shift as a waitress.
She was later hired as volunteer coordinator and eventually named
director of the food bank, the ninth largest in the state.</TE>
<TE>   She shares her personal history when soliciting donations from
community groups. "I grew up in an orphanage and my job was to go
door to door, begging for food," she will say. "And I'm still doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   People sometimes ask her skeptically if MEND recipients are truly
in need. Aren't they just trying to get free food?</TE>
<TE>   Mirabella tells them that when people stand in the hot sun for
three, four or five hours to get a box of food, she knows they are
needy. Anyone who is not needy, she said, would not do that.</TE>
<TE>   "She treats people with respect and dignity because she knows how
hard it is to stand in line and ask for food," said Michael Flood,
executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. "In this
day and age we ask, 'Can only one or two people make a difference?'
[Gina is] a testament to that. You can't calculate the magnitude of
what she is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Mirabella is slowly piecing her own fragmented life back together.
She reunited with her sons. And she met and fell in love with Joe
Mirabella, a retired contractor. "He was a widower and I was the lost
one," she said. The couple, who now live in Woodland Hills, have been
married 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Mirabella said her lows--as well as her highs--have
enriched her life. "All the bad things that happened to me were
actually answered prayers."</TE>

<HD>Mom Gets a Diploma From Her Daughter, the Principal</HD>
<DH>Education: At charter school in Anaheim, a woman rejoined
pupil ranks after 30 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graduation is a proud day for any educator, but for Gladys Martinez,
principal of an Anaheim charter high school, Saturday was extra
special. Among her graduating students was her mother, Yolanda, the
class valedictorian.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so wonderful, like I was in a dream. I feel as if I were
floating in the air," Yolanda Martinez, 48, said after the graduation
ceremony at Santa Ana Community College.</LD>
<LD>   During her valedictory address, she thanked her parents and
daughter for motivating her to continue studying, and she encouraged
the other 14 graduates to continue studying. "It is possible to
achieve what we aspire [to]," she told her classmates, adding, "I
hope to see you in college."</LD>
<TE>   Like many of her fellow graduates, Yolanda Martinez put schooling
on hold when she immigrated to America. The Mexican native got a job,
married and raised a family. Thirty years went by before she decided
to hit the books again.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez's daughter, Gladys, the oldest of four children,
is a self-assured woman, the first in her family to go to college.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two years ago, Gladys Martinez co-founded EDUCATE, a
charter school that helps immigrant adults learn English and get high
school diplomas. The school has 280 students and campuses in Anaheim
and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez was among the first to enroll. She said she
joined the program at first as a favor to her daughter, who needed
students.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother is why I am here today," said Gladys Martinez, 26,
director of the Anaheim campus. She "encouraged and pushed me to take
school seriously....It was my turn to push her into her dream."</TE>
<TE>   Not that her mother needs much pushing.</TE>
<TE>   The Ontario resident is enrolled in courses at Chaffey Community
College in Rancho Cucamonga, hoping one day to get a bachelor's
degree in sociology and become a teacher, just like her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected to learn again," the beaming high school
graduate said. "It's hard to believe that it's true, but I did it.
This is my first step, my first step to the future....I don't know if
it is too late ..."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not too late," her daughter assured her.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez dropped out of vocational school in Mexicali,
Mexico, when she was 17. She and her mother moved to the San Fernando
Valley to join her father and to care for him.</TE>
<TE>   She had never met her father, a Chicago native and World War II
veteran, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly before Yolanda
was born. Her mother had moved to Mexico to shield Yolanda from her
dad's illness. As a young woman, Yolanda Martinez was expected to
work and help her mother. She eventually married and had a family,
while holding jobs and caring for her aging parents. They live nearby
in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years," Yolanda mused during class recently. "It went by
really fast."</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda inspired in her children an interest in education.

<HD>Mom Gets Diploma From Daughter, the Principal</HD>
<DH>Education: At charter school in Anaheim, a woman rejoined
pupil ranks after 30 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graduation is a proud day for any educator, but for Gladys Martinez,
principal of an Anaheim charter high school, Saturday was extra
special. Among her graduating students was her mother, Yolanda, the
class valedictorian.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so wonderful, like I was in a dream. I feel as if I were
floating in the air," Yolanda Martinez, 48, said after the graduation
ceremony at Santa Ana Community College.</LD>
<LD>   During her valedictory address, she thanked her parents and
daughter for motivating her to continue studying, and she encouraged
the other 14 graduates to continue studying. "It is possible to
achieve what we aspire [to]," she told her classmates, adding, "I
hope to see you in college."</LD>
<TE>   Like many of her fellow graduates, Yolanda Martinez put schooling
on hold when she immigrated to America. The Mexican native got a job,
married and raised a family. Thirty years went by before she decided
to hit the books again.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez's daughter, Gladys, the oldest of four children,
is a self-assured woman, the first in her family to go to college.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two years ago, Gladys Martinez co-founded EDUCATE, a
charter school that helps immigrant adults learn English and get high
school diplomas. The school has 280 students and campuses in Anaheim
and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez was among the first to enroll. She said she
joined the program at first as a favor to her daughter, who needed
students.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother is why I am here today," said Gladys Martinez, 26,
director of the Anaheim campus. She "encouraged and pushed me to take
school seriously.... It was my turn to push her into her dream."</TE>
<TE>   Not that her mother needs much pushing.</TE>
<TE>   The Ontario resident is enrolled in courses at Chaffey Community
College in Rancho Cucamonga, hoping one day to get a bachelor's
degree in sociology and become a teacher, just like her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected to learn again," the beaming high school
graduate said. "It's hard to believe that it's true, but I did it.
This is my first step, my first step to the future.... I don't know
if it is too late ..."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not too late," her daughter assured her.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Martinez dropped out of vocational school in Mexicali,
Mexico, when she was 17. She and her mother moved to the San Fernando
Valley to join her father and to care for him.</TE>
<TE>   She had never met her father, a Chicago native and World War II
veteran, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia shortly before Yolanda
was born.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother had moved to Mexico to shield Yolanda from her dad's
illness. As a young woman, Yolanda Martinez was expected to work and
help her mother. She eventually married and had a family, while
holding jobs and caring for her aging parents. They live nearby in
Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty years," Yolanda mused during class recently. "It went by
really fast."</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda instilled in her children an interest in education.
Daughter Janett, 23, is a senior at Cal State Fullerton, studying to
become a Spanish teacher. Yesenia, 17, will be a senior at Katella
High School in Anaheim in the fall. And 14-year-old Armando just
graduated from junior high in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Gladys said that when she was growing up, "My dad made sure we did
our homework, but my mom was the one who helped us with the
homework."</TE>
<TE>   When it was the daughter's turn to help her mother, the principal
admitted, she did not always have the patience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd tell her to look in the book and [find] the answers," said
Gladys. "No," her mother would insist, wanting her daughter to help.
"I have to know this."</TE>
<TE>   The insistence paid off. Yolanda Martinez graduated with a 3.9
grade-point average.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Ludy Ureno, 30, of Anaheim hopes to follow in Martinez's
footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in here is an inspiration," Ureno, who just began her
studies, said during class last week. "It is not just about getting a
high school diploma. It is about learning."</TE>

<HD>Ecstatic Fans in Koreatown Celebrate Soccer Win</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the South Korean soccer team beat Spain on Saturday morning,
5,000 ecstatic fans in red, who had gathered in a parking lot in
Koreatown to watch the game, danced in circles, waved flags and
sparklers, screamed, kissed and hugged.</LD>
<LD>   "Go Korea! Go Korea! Go Korea!" screamed Patty Nam, 54, who was
jumping up and down. "I feel great. It's marvelous. Oooohhh."</LD>
<LD>   "I am so happy and proud," said Seok Kyun, a traffic volunteer who
stood in the middle of 6th Street after 2 a.m. "Nobody thought Korea
could do it."</LD>
<TE>   South Korea, the co-host of the World Cup in Asia, upset Spain 5-3
in a penalty-kick shootout after a 0-0 tie. South Korea, which has
not won a game in five previous World Cup competitions, is the first
Asian team to ever reach the semifinals. The team will play Germany
on Tuesday in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Early Saturday morning, more than 5,000 people sat in orderly rows
watching the game on big screens at 6th and Kenmore Avenue in Los
Angeles. Local businesses served free coffee, and children slept on
their parents' shoulders. When Korean players tumbled, the crowd let
out a collective moan. When they got back up, everyone cheered and
clapped as if they had scored. Area bars were also filled with fans
wearing red, while 3,000 people had gathered inside the Koreatown
Galleria, at Olympic and Western.</TE>
<TE>   "We're painting the town red," said Veronica Lee, 32, a marketing
representative for the Galleria, referring to the Red Devils, as the
Korean team is known. She watched the game at the Galleria. "I'm
rooting for the Korean team. I want them to hear my roaring voice all
the way in Korea."</TE>
<TE>   The game began about 11:40 p.m. Friday night and ended about 2:15
a.m. After it ended, thousands of fans celebrated and soon left the
area, after picking up their trash.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't believe it," said Scott Koegel, a Los Angeles Police
Department traffic officer. "The street is going to be cleaner than
when they got here."</TE>
<TE>   An LAPD spokesman said Saturday that no arrests were made during
the morning celebration.</TE>
<TE>   For blocks around Koreatown, traffic was stopped and people sat in
their cars honking their horns.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, the Koreatown Galleria was still a sea of
red. South Korean soccer fans spent the day eating lunch and shopping
while wearing red T-shirts, hats, tank tops and bandannas.</TE>
<TE>   Others read the Saturday editions of the Korea Times, the Korea
Daily and the Daily Sports Seoul USA, all of which had stories about
the South Korean soccer team's win on their front pages.</TE>
<TE>   By noon, Tee-ffany, a sports memorabilia stand in the Galleria,
had sold out of Red Devil T-shirts, with the words: "Be the Reds." A
saleswoman at the store said customers had snatched up more than
2,000 shirts and 500 flags since Friday. Meanwhile, the Galleria had
distributed 3,000 free T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   After a night of celebration that lasted until 5 a.m., Peter Won,
23, of Los Angeles and Ryan Lee, 23, a student at UC Berkeley, were
back at the Galleria buying flags to mount on their cars. They
planned to cruise around town all day continuing the jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to represent our country and show our pride in Korea,"
said Won, who has been in the United States for 10 years. "They're
going to win the semifinals, no doubt. They're going to take it all
the way."</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who moved to the U.S. seven years ago from South Korea, said
the World Cup has given natives a chance to express their love for
their country.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Lee said she is moved by South Korea's win because it has
united Koreans from all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so happy, I was jumping up and down uncontrollably," she
said. "But this morning, as I drove around, I still saw the flags and
people honking. Tears came to my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said it is an exciting time for Koreans, and even if the team
loses, "it's party time for all of us."</TE>

<HD>E-Mail Suggests DWP Role in Trading Scheme</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Evidence uncovered by a state Senate investigation of California's
electricity crisis includes a warning from an energy trader in which
he suggests that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
engaged in "ricochet," a trading scheme to raise power prices that
the DWP has denied using.</LD>
<LD>   Among the documents turned over to Senate investigators recently
and obtained by The Times is a November 2000 e-mail from an employee
of the energy-trading arm of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. that
specifically advised other power traders to "beware of ricochets with
LDWP." The term "ricochet" is commonly used in the energy-trading
business to refer to a scheme in which power is traded back and forth
across the California border in order to inflate its price. The
practice is also known as "megawatt laundering."</LD>
<LD>   DWP officials declared under oath to state and federal
investigators last month that the city utility did not engage in
ricochet transactions in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the select
committee to investigate possible price manipulation of California's
now-defunct energy market, said Thursday that the PG&amp;E National
Energy Group e-mail will prompt him to hold hearings, perhaps as soon
as this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an area that we will be exploring in great detail, and I
hope for their sake it doesn't turn out to be what it initially
appears to be, and that is that LADWP committed perjury," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the senator's comment is a two-sentence e-mail
sent Nov. 12, 2000, by David Pierce, an employee of the unregulated
trading division of San Francisco-based PG&amp;E Corp. "If L.A. agrees to
wheel power to Malin [the California-Oregon border] on your behalf,
you must make sure that the power is delivered on the other side of
the California border," states the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce goes on to say the California Independent System Operator,
which manages most of the state's transmission grid, "is savvy to
L.A.'s attempts to circumvent ricochets by showing an export and
import of equal megawatts on the California side of the tie in order
to hide the ricochet nature of the transaction."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, strategies such as the ricochet could have
allowed a company to circumvent a federal price cap in California. At
times, it also could have enabled a firm to take advantage of
Cal-ISO's willingness to pay hundreds of dollars for a single
megawatt on short notice to avoid triggering blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Ricochet is one of the strategies described by Enron Corp. in a
December 2000 memo that was made public last month by federal energy
regulators. The memo describes schemes that the now-bankrupt company
was using in California's electricity market, including those dubbed
Death Star, Fat Boy and Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   In the ricochet scheme, according to the Enron memo, traders would
buy electricity in the California market and arrange to sell it out
of state to another company. Then Enron would buy back a similar
amount of power, bring it to California and sell it at a higher price
to state grid operators, who need power on short notice to balance
the flow of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Martinez, the DWP's assistant general manager for power,
said Friday that he would study records to get a better understanding
of the sort of transactions his agency might have been making in
November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But, Martinez said, he believes that the PG&amp;E e-mail refers to a
different kind of transaction from the ricochet trades described by
Enron. He said the e-mail probably uses ricochet to mean a
transaction in which electricity flows to the state border, but is
then redirected back into California.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about it as though you're throwing a ball against a wall
and the ball bounces back," Martinez said. "The wall is your
connection between California and Oregon."</TE>
<TE>   The DWP generally avoids such transactions, he said, because they
are a headache to track.</TE>
<TE>   "It's undesirable," Martinez said, "but I cannot say fully that
we've never done it. I can't get a lot of details into what happened
here until I get more facts."</TE>
<TE>   S. David Freeman, who was general manager of the DWP in the fall
of 2000 but now serves as chairman of the state's new public power
authority, said he was not aware of the DWP ever engaging in
Enron-style ricochet trades.</TE>
<TE>   It may be that other companies used the DWP's extensive
transmission grid to make such trades, Freeman said. The publicly
owned utility holds rights to the main transmission line that crosses
the California-Oregon border and connects Southern California to the
Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "It is entirely theoretically possible that somebody did a
ricochet transaction and used our lines and we wouldn't know about
it," said Freeman. "We weren't traders; we didn't buy and sell power
on a daily basis like Enron and those other guys."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman is scheduled to face the Senate on Monday for a vote on
whether he should be confirmed as chairman of the Consumer Power and
Conservation Financing Authority, which was created by the
Legislature less than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman won a 3-2 vote of approval from the Senate Rules Committee
in March, but faced questions about the degree to which the DWP
profited from the meltdown of California's power market in 2000 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The utility opted not to follow California's deregulation plan and
enjoyed abundant power supplies during the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said that as general manager, he insisted that the DWP
charge other utilities no more than 15% profit on power sales. But a
study conducted by the DWP after Freeman left in the spring of 2001
concluded that the utility earned an average of 56% more than its
costs on power sold through the state market.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), vice chairman of the
committee investigating the electricity crisis, called the DWP the
least cooperative municipal utility district in terms of providing
documents and testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd give them a D in citizenship," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The PG&amp;E e-mail referring to the DWP "raises serious questions as
to the accuracy of their denial," Morrow said, adding that the
committee intends to interview Freeman about the issue.</TE>
<TE>   After the release of the Enron trading scheme memo in May, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Dunn's committee asked
dozens of energy companies to declare whether they had used similar
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   In a May 21 statement to FERC, Martinez declared that the DWP had
engaged in none of the schemes described in the Enron memo. In a May
30 declaration to Dunn, DWP wholesale marketing manager Mark S. Ward
made a similar assertion.</TE>
<TE>   DWP spokeswoman Darlene Battle said the e-mail released by Dunn
does not contradict those statements.</TE>

<HD>Details Sketchy in Hahn's LAX Modernization Plan</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Proposal, which favors security over expansion,
includes off-site check-in, new terminals and a revised runway
configuration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight years, $103 million in expenditures and 33 alternatives later,
city officials are still without a definitive plan to modernize aging
Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   What began in the mid-1990s as an ambitious vision--increase the
airport's capacity to 98 million passengers a year by adding new
runways and terminals--is now a significantly scaled-back proposal
that would allow little growth, yet still cost billions.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly how much Mayor James K. Hahn's modernization plan would
cost is one of many outstanding questions about his fledgling
proposal, which favors security and safety over expansion.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the $103 million spent overall has gone in contracts
awarded during Mayor Richard Riordan's administration for plans that
have since been abandoned, according to records obtained by The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Since Hahn took office last year, the city agency that operates
LAX has spent about $10 million studying how to improve the world's
third busiest airport. That is $830,000 a month, almost the same pace
as the Riordan administration's spending. Experts say the planning
costs will increase as the mayor pursues his vision, conceived on the
back of an envelope and first outlined several weeks after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some details have come into focus. Hahn hasn't yet formally
released his proposal. But in briefings with airport-area residents
and business leaders, his staff has described a dramatically
different look at the 42-year-old facility.</TE>
<TE>   Most vehicular traffic would disappear from the airport's
horseshoe-shaped roadway, rerouted to a remote check-in facility near
the San Diego Freeway. A people mover would take passengers to the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Terminals 1, 2 and 3 would be demolished for a new runway
configuration and new terminals would be built where the central
parking structures are now.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the plan to expand LAX has shifted from
construction of two runways into Santa Monica Bay to use of the
Hawthorne Municipal Airport for commuter airline traffic and then to
Riordan's vision--addition of a large terminal on the airport's
western end, but no new runways.</TE>
<TE>   Community and business leaders are anxiously awaiting a detailed
version of the most recent proposal, known by Hahn's staff as the
"fifth alternative." The mayor's office has said repeatedly that the
document would be ready soon, but has not elaborated.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a mayor announces a definitive plan, it typically takes
at least three years for environmental reports to be completed and
approved by federal officials, according to a Federal Aviation
Administration study of modernization timelines at major U.S.
airports.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's office says it can reduce this delay by adding the
fifth alternative to Riordan's master plan and using parts of a
12,000-page environmental report issued with that plan in January
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Because the LAX modernization plan has changed so many times,
pre-planning costs here are significantly higher than amounts spent
to study expansion at other major airports. Officials spent $26.6
million before beginning construction on the $3-billion Denver
International Airport in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to improve Seattle-Tacoma International Airport ran about
$43.8 million in the planning phase on a $3-billion
project--including $30 million in legal fees stemming from a fight
over a third runway. Norfolk International Airport in Virginia plans
to spend $100 million on both planning and construction costs for a
new runway.</TE>
<TE>   But it's difficult to compare plans to modernize LAX with those
for other facilities, experts say, because no other airport
improvement project approaches the scope that city officials have
proposed for LAX. Complex environmental studies required under
California law also add significant costs, said Richard Marchi,
senior vice president of technical and environmental affairs for
Airports Council International, an airports trade group.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles undertaking was at a scale that's much larger
than most airports when they do a master plan," Marchi said. "Most
airports talk about adding a terminal or a runway, not about
reconfiguring airport boundaries and changing the layout of the
facility."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's proposal has graduated from the back of an envelope to a
piece of paper stuffed in the pocket of the Airport Commission
president, Ted Stein.</TE>
<TE>   Stein has used the rumpled document at meetings recently to brief
business and community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they decided to hold the briefings using just
an outline so they could incorporate the response in the final
document.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need here is a consensus to move forward with a
multibillion-dollar project," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   But therein lies a dilemma for the mayor's office: Many said their
first impressions of Hahn's plan had been clouded by its lack of
detail.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of Hahn's alternative tops the list of unanswered
questions raised by business leaders and airport tenants. Figures
floated at the briefings range from $6 billion to $8 billion, which
would make LAX modernization among the most expensive public works
projects in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost and financing of the Fifth Alternative is a huge
concern," American Airlines said in a letter to Deputy Mayor Troy
Edwards and Stein, who briefed the company. "We are unaware of any
other airport in the country that is considering embarking upon a $6-
to $7-billion improvement program in these economically troubled
times, much less one that does not add to overall airport capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Capacity is also a key issue for both business and community
leaders. Hahn, following through on a pledge he signed during the
mayoral campaign to limit LAX to its existing facilities, has
proposed capping the airport at 78 million annual passengers. LAX was
used by 61 million passengers last year--about 65% more than it was
built to serve.</TE>
<TE>   How Hahn will limit growth at the airport remains an open
question. The airlines control flight schedules at the nation's 429
commercial airports, and they have repeatedly said they favor LAX
over regional airports.</TE>
<TE>   Costs and capacity aside, Hahn's proposal, as outlined at the
dozen or so briefings held so far, would dramatically alter the
airport's geography. Some key elements:</TE>
<TE>   * A new terminal at Manchester Square, a 143-acre area just north
and east of the airport--bordered by Arbor Vitae Street on the north,
La Cienega Boulevard on the east, Aviation Boulevard on the west and
just shy of Century Boulevard on the south--that would house
passenger drop-off and arrival areas. The facility would include at
least 9,000 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   * A people mover that would take passengers on a four-minute ride
from Manchester Square to LAX. This system would also connect the
Green Line, which ends about a mile from LAX, with Manchester Square.</TE>
<TE>   * A centerline taxiway between the two parallel runways on the
north side of the airfield. Space for the taxiway would be opened up
by moving the runways closer to the terminals--a change that would
necessitate demolishing Terminals 1, 2 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   * A terminal complex in the middle of the airport's
horseshoe-shaped roadway. The plan calls for knocking down the
existing parking structures and replacing them with facilities where
passengers would go through security screening.</TE>
<TE>   * A concourse on the western side of the airfield behind the Tom
Bradley International Terminal with gates that would help make up for
those lost with the demolition of the three terminals on the
airport's north side.</TE>
<TE>   * A taxiway on the eastern side of the airfield near Sepulveda
Boulevard that would connect the north and south sides of the
airfield and require the demolition of Terminal 8 and the airport
agency's administrative building.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has received mixed reactions. Residents are pleased that
Hahn has stood by a promise to eliminate several controversial
elements from Riordan's plan, such as a large terminal on the western
edge of the airport and a road that would have encircled the
3,500-acre facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at the plan I felt like, 'My gosh, they really did
listen,' " said Gwen Vuchsas, a Playa del Rey resident who attended a
briefing earlier this month. "I felt encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Some business leaders expressed concern that the plan might carry
vehicles away from retail centers in communities around LAX that rely
on airport traffic to make money.</TE>
<TE>   A Westchester businessman, Howard Drollinger, said transferring
traffic from major arteries like Sepulveda and Lincoln boulevards to
Manchester Square might harm local stores. Drollinger plans to poll
400 tenants that his property management company represents in the
area to see how a reduction in traffic might affect their books.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues left to be resolved before Hahn completes his
plan are how much security activity would be at Manchester Square,
where passengers would be dropped off or park their cars. Would
passengers go through screening there? Would they have to take their
bags from this facility to the airport, via the people mover? Several
who attended briefings said such a requirement would greatly
inconvenience travelers.</TE>
<TE>   "That alternative seems to me to be absolutely unacceptable," said
Bruce Karatz, chief executive of the Los Angeles-based builder KB
Home. "I can't imagine an elderly couple being dropped off and having
to be in charge of their bags on a moving sidewalk."</TE>
<TE>   At several briefings, Stein and Edwards discussed the possibility
of an underground tunnel to transport baggage to and from Manchester
Square. But such systems--like one at Denver International
Airport--are expensive and glitch-prone, leading American Airlines
and Karatz to question whether the city can afford to include one in
the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed doubts about the wisdom of moving passengers from
the nine terminals in LAX's central terminal area to a remote
facility that would concentrate travelers in one place.</TE>
<TE>   "Any such plan must first ensure that we do not further
concentrate passengers as a terrorist target," wrote Lee Harrington,
chief executive of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.,
in an op-ed article in late May.</TE>
<TE>   Also uncertain is what would be done to address near misses
between aircraft on the south side of the airfield--where about 80%
of the near-collisions documented at LAX occur.</TE>
<TE>   To address this issue, officials have discussed moving the two
parallel runways on the south side farther apart to give planes more
room to maneuver. But to do so, the city agency would need to move
the far left runway 50 feet closer to El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders don't like this idea, saying that, to improve
safety on the airfield's south side, air traffic controllers should
have planes taxi to the end of the outboard runway and then cross
over the inboard runway on their way to the terminals.</TE>
<TE>   But squabbles over details aside, many who firmly opposed airport
expansion over the years are pleased with Hahn's approach to
modernization--so far.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they're showing the plan to stakeholders is a
positive attempt to try to reach out to the communities," said Mike
Gordon, the mayor of El Segundo, who led a drive to kill Riordan's
master plan. "But in the end, it will still come down to what the
plan is and are they going to limit the airport's growth."</TE>

<LD>Summer came to Silver Lake at precisely the same time this year as
last. It happened one month ago, when I awakened to new sounds and
smells and a different feel in the air. It was as if an entirely
separate climate had been imported overnight, and a bird sanctuary
had been established outside my bedroom window.</LD>
<LD>   I got up and did what a man does. I went out and inspected the
barbecue, and I checked on the gin and tonic supply, because I could
see myself on the back deck for the next 150 nights, watching the sky
catch fire as the sun sets over Griffith Park.</LD>
<LD>   To be honest, I never saw myself living in Silver Lake. Last time
I lived in Los Angeles, I rented a place seven blocks from the beach
on the Venice-Santa Monica border, and I couldn't imagine moving
inland.</LD>
<TE>   Especially not to Silver Lake, which is so often described as hip
and trendy. I have spent my entire adult life avoiding any indulgence
that might be considered hip or trendy.</TE>
<TE>   But you know the L.A. story. Head east from the Westside, and for
every mile you travel, you get 10% more house for 10% less money.
When I moved back here from the East Coast, I thought of buying in
San Bernardino and just retiring, but got only as far as Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   So now, having lived in Santa Monica and not far from Dodger
Stadium, two places with vibes as different as their climates, I sit
up there on my deck and play the East-West rivalry game in my head.</TE>
<TE>   What's the better deal all around?</TE>
<TE>   The Westside is full of people who proudly tell you they never go
east of Robertson. The Eastside is full of people who proudly tell
you they never go west of Western. It's a class war, and the
mid-Wilshire district is like Switzerland. You can eat at El Cholo
one night and Canter's the next, and not have to apologize to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Just last weekend my wife and I drove back to our old neighborhood
and rode bikes up the beach trail, like we used to do, and the truth
is that I miss summer on the Westside. I used to take the Big Blue
Bus home from my office on Wilshire near Barrington, ride my bike to
the beach, and swim out far enough to see a dolphin up close.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the season, there's a foot-long fish--I don't know what
kind--that comes feeding in ankle-deep water and sometimes washes
over your feet. And over by the Santa Monica Pier, where immigrants
swim in their pants and someone is always shooting a movie, the city
has an edge-of-the-continent feel all its own, the scene bathed in
light that exists nowhere else.</TE>
<TE>   I miss the mystery and romance of the open sea, just as I miss
morning fog, coffee at the Rose Cafe, and the salted, twilight breeze
that blows through the open door and across the bar at Chez Jay.</TE>
<TE>   But summer is never sure it's interested in damp Santa Monica. In
Silver Lake, it comes fast and settles languorously, scented with a
balm of pine and eucalyptus and smoke from the neighbor's grill.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it feels as though we've left a tourist destination and
found a neighborhood. We made few acquaintances on the Westside, but
a neighbor left a bottle of champagne on our door when we moved
inland, and we knew almost everyone on our block in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In a Silver Lake summer, a guy known only as the Walking Man sheds
his shirt and turns mahogany by mid-June, cutting along side streets
and switchbacks while reading a newspaper or magazine every step of
the way. At dusk, there's a parade quality to the procession of
ramblers who circle the lake.</TE>
<TE>   I traded beer for gin, dolphins for coyotes, Ocean Park for
Griffith Park. It was a fair exchange, even if at times I feel a bit
like Woody Allen on a camping trip.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I have a problem with the birds of Silver Lake. It's
certainly nice that a few minutes from downtown, in the land of
asphalt and monoxide, winged creatures are still breathing. But just
as summer arrives in the middle of the night, so does the cacophony.
Maybe it's just that my neighbor has lots of trees, but they're at it
24 hours a day, and sometimes it's loud enough that the LAPD
helicopters are a relief.</TE>
<TE>   After several sleepless nights in the Tiki Room, I put a jar of
pennies by my balcony, figuring I'd toss them at the birds if they
woke me again, which they did. My wife awoke to find me throwing
loose change into the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't care," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who doesn't care?" she asked, half asleep.</TE>
<TE>   "The birds. I'm throwing pennies at them and they still won't shut
up."</TE>
<TE>   She suggested quarters, which reminded me why I don't go shopping
with her.</TE>
<TE>   If it's not chirping birds, it's the howling coyotes who live in
the brush around the reservoir and prowl for pets at night. But
there's something soothing about all these sounds; something that
evokes a time when the frontier was closer, the desert more obvious,
our histories unwritten.</TE>
<TE>   I can't look out on the ocean now, but I can sit on the deck at
dusk and watch the Los Angeles sky do amazing things in pink and
blue, each night bringing the promise of the unknown. The sun drops
behind the observatory in June and then inches north toward the
Hollywood sign as summer marches on, re-landscaping the sky with
every fade-out.</TE>
<TE>   The picture does not require a soundtrack, but sometimes I'll
listen to Vin Scully, whose voice is such a comfort, you almost
forget about the game. The other night I switched to KLON, and as
Etta James sang "I Want to be Loved," the sky blushed.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great glories of Southern California is that within a
few miles, you can find such physical extremes and social
distinctions. For all the hassle of moving as much as I have, I think
you take more notice of a place when you're new to it. You pick up
every nuance and angle, you have faith in your own discoveries, and
you welcome all offers of champagne.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, you make a home. And summer waltzes in.</TE>

<HD>Davis Reverses Board, Won't Parole Abused Woman Convicted
of Murder</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has denied parole to an abused woman convicted of
killing a man in 1981, despite a determination by the state Board of
Prison Terms that she was violently raped and continuously abused by
him and that she should be released from prison.</LD>
<LD>   The governor acknowledged that Maria Suarez, 42, suffered from
battered woman syndrome at the time, but said there were conflicting
accounts about her role in soliciting the murder of Anselmo
Covarrubias.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a serious dispute as to what role Ms. Suarez played in
instigating and planning the crime," Davis wrote in his review of the
case. He also cited police reports suggesting that Suarez "acted not
just because she was battered, but that she was motivated by
jealousy, fear and greed."</LD>
<TE>   Covarrubias had placed Suarez's name on the title to his house
because he was involved in divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, but
had demanded that she return that title.</TE>
<TE>   Davis directed the board to continue investigating Suarez's case
and wrote that he may consider the issue again at her next hearing.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the Sheriff's
Department oppose paroling Suarez, according to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez's niece, Patricia Valencia, said she questioned the
governor's motive in reversing the parole board.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's more of a political decision," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has only paroled two murderers out of the more than 80 cases
he has reviewed. Both parolees were women who killed after years of
abuse and both were convicted before the state allowed testimony on
battered woman syndrome to be presented in court.</TE>
<TE>   He has, however, denied parole requests to other women in similar
situations.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say battered woman syndrome is a behavioral condition that
afflicts those who are systematically abused. Feeling powerless or
fearing reprisals, victims tend to stay in abusive relationships and
may ultimately see suicide or homicide as the only way out.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez was convicted of first-degree murder in 1981, after living
for five years with a man 50 years older than her who threatened to
use witchcraft to kill her family if she told anyone about the rape,
according to the governor's review.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez was 16 when she left Mexico and moved to the United States
in 1976 to live with her sister. She went to Covarrubias' home soon
on a promise of work. She may have been purchased by Covarrubias for
$200, the review says.</TE>
<TE>   For the next five years, documents say, Covarrubias abused Suarez
sexually, physically and psychologically.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, 1981, Rene Soto, a man who lived across the street
from the couple, killed Covarrubias by hitting him repeatedly with a
wooden table leg. Soto and another woman were also convicted in the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Suarez helped plan the murder and then cleaned
and hid the weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez's supporters started an organization called Women in Prison
to advocate for her release.</TE>
<TE>   Max Blumenthal, the group's assistant director, said the
governor's decision shows that he is not taking battered woman
syndrome seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a message to battered women and all women that Davis
doesn't trust them and won't take their words over those of their
abusers," Blumenthal said.</TE>

<LD>One of the first places I visited in Orange County was a home in
Garden Grove. It must have been sometime in the 1970s, and I could
swear we played lawn darts and barbecued. All these years later,
that's still how I see Garden Grove: a backyard with people playing
lawn darts and something cooking on the grill.</LD>
<LD>   That scene might play well in the family photo albums, but it
doesn't pay the bills. And that, to one degree or another, is the
argument City Hall likely will make Tuesday night when planners argue
for claiming some homes (and backyards) as part of a redevelopment
proposal to boost the city's bank account.</LD>
<LD>   "The issue for Garden Grove is that we're one of the poorest
communities in Orange County," says City Manager George Tindall. "If
you count property tax and sales tax and vehicle licensing tax, all
those revenues, and divide by the population, only Stanton is less
than we are."</LD>
<TE>   He says the city has one of the lowest city employee-to-resident
ratios in the county. For example, he says, the Police Department has
the same number of employees it had 12 years ago, when census figures
show the city had 22,000 fewer residents.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday night's public hearing, the council will hear
recommendations on targeting 150 to 200 acres of property, for the
sole purpose of making it part of a long-range redevelopment project
along Harbor Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of that, unfortunately," Tindall says, "is single-family
homes."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunate, Tindall says, because "no public agency wants to
include single-family homes in these [redevelopment] areas."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt the council also will hear from residents who condemn the
city for even thinking about displacing families--even with
compensation--just to make money. It is a philosophical
argument--private homes versus public revenue--that city planners
generally are loath to decide.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is front and center because, among other things, the
council might have to invoke eminent domain to get some residential
properties. Garden Grove need only look to Cypress, which is invoking
eminent domain on church-held property in order to build a commercial
center. But Cypress isn't talking about forcing residents from their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Eminent domain, Tindall says, "is a bad, bad word. The City
Council does not ever want to use that tool unless absolutely
necessary."</TE>
<TE>   But if a city hopes to lure new business investment, it has to be
able to deliver land, Tindall says.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a crossing-of-the-Rubicon element to using
eminent domain on owner-occupied homes. That isn't lost on Tindall,
who says it would set a precedent in Garden Grove, even while quickly
noting that he doesn't subscribe to the idea that it would redefine
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll always be a bedroom community," he says. "Seventy percent
of our land use is single-family. We're always going to be
single-family. This is a small piece of the city--150 acres--and is
something that is not going to happen tomorrow [but over 20 years]."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tindall isn't trying to have it both ways. He knows that
City Hall would be making a statement just by voting to invoke
eminent domain. The five-member council hasn't indicated which way it
is leaning, although Mayor Bruce Broadwater has all but said the
redevelopment is essential.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the public benefit outweighed by the private-party interest?"
Tindall asks. "That's what makes this issue tough."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for him, he doesn't have to vote on it and put a council
seat on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he'll no doubt feel the chill Tuesday night from some
residents who will ask why the city should be empowered to take their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to be liked," Tindall says. "This is the hard part of the
job."</TE>

<LD>John Berberich, 64, a police psychologist who was the first to draw
up a profile of serial killer Ted Bundy, died at a hospital in
Bellevue, Wash., on Wednesday after apparently suffering a heart
attack while playing golf.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Keppel, an investigative consultant who once worked for the
state attorney general's office in Washington, credited Berberich
with doing the first profile on Bundy in 1974.</LD>
<LD>   An associate professor of psychology at the University of
Washington, Berberich worked extensively as a consultant to police
agencies and courts, developing and administering psychological tests
for new police officers. He also taught at the FBI Academy.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, Berberich served in the Marine Corps. He
attended UCLA, where he played basketball under coach John Wooden and
was a co-captain on the 1960-61 team, and later earned his PhD at
UCLA.</TE>

<LD>Ron Kline, 70, a star relief pitcher who won 114 games during a
19-year major league career with several teams, died Saturday at his
home in Callery, Pa. He was hospitalized last week for heart and
kidney problems, but the cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   A starting pitcher early in his career who later became an
accomplished relief pitcher, Kline played for nine teams and had
three tours of duty with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who originally
brought him to the majors in 1952.</LD>
<LD>   Kline also played for the Tigers, Twins, Angels and Senators,
never making a start after the 1961 season. He made the conversion to
late-inning reliever with the Senators, saving an American
League-leading 29 games in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 218 home runs he gave up during his career were the
first by Giants Hall of Famer Willie McCovey and the 200th by career
home-run king Hank Aaron.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving baseball, Kline returned to Callery, his hometown,
and served a term as mayor.</TE>

<HD>Union Members Rally to Denounce Secession</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Hundreds of blue-collar workers who see breakup
of L.A. as a threat to their economic survival are cheered on by
city's political elite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energized by the rousing beat of a gospel choir, hundreds of union
members jammed into a stuffy auditorium Saturday at Los Angeles
Valley College to denounce secession as a threat to their economic
survival.</LD>
<LD>   It was the largest turnout by far for any secession-themed event
and a reminder of the broad spectrum of interests fighting a city
breakup in the Nov. 5 election. A parade of some of the city's
best-paid public servants--politicians--took to the stage to cheer on
about 700 blue-collar workers who earn modest wages collecting trash
and mopping floors.</LD>
<LD>   Their message was clear: If voters approve cityhood for the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood, workers will suffer. City jobs could
be lost, salaries and pensions slashed. Laws meant to protect working
families in Los Angeles--including rent control, anti-discrimination
and living-wage ordinances--could be undone by the new cities. Labor
unions plan to unleash thousands of volunteers and spend more than $1
million on the anti-secession campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Secession leaders argue that union fears are overblown and that
labor will have a say in the new cities just as it does in Los
Angeles. But if any separatists were among the audience Saturday,
they kept a low profile as speaker after speaker denounced a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the people in this room come from corners all over the
earth," said former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, whose 2001
campaign to become Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in modern times
made him a hero among many workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Make no mistake about it, Los Angeles is the preeminent city in
the world.... The reason this city is so special is because of the
people in it. You don't break up the family just because there's a
problem," Villaraigosa said, calling on the man who defeated him at
the polls, Mayor James K. Hahn, to join him at the podium.</TE>
<TE>   Pumping their fists skyward like champion boxers, the former
rivals led the crowd in the perennial chant made famous by the United
Farm Workers of America: "Si, se puede!" Yes, it can be done.</TE>
<TE>   The state commission that sent the secession proposals to the
ballot studied their financial impact for more than two years. It
concluded that a breakup would not harm the new cities or the
remainder of Los Angeles, but left many questions unanswered about
job availability, salaries and benefits for employees transferring to
a Valley or Hollywood city.</TE>
<TE>   If secession wins, the newborn cities would adopt all Los Angeles
ordinances for four months. But then it would be up to the new
governments to decide which laws to keep. Some secession leaders have
predicted that the Valley and Hollywood would, for example, enact
rent control--but they don't speak for officials yet to be elected.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can lose all of that progressive legislation and all
those protections for seniors and workers if the city breaks up,"
Hahn said. "The people who are selling secession are selling snake
oil."</TE>
<TE>   For two hours, workers sat patiently as the city's political elite
made its case. Former Mayor Richard Riordan, City Council President
Alex Padilla and labor boss Miguel Contreras, head of the Los Angeles
County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, all took the mike to criticize
secession, as did an assortment of religious leaders and legislative
aides.</TE>
<TE>   Applause coursed through the audience, a sea of union colors, each
time someone praised their hard work and hard-won benefits. The
restaurant workers wore blue T-shirts. The city librarians chose
hunter green. Janitors were decked out in purple, shoulder to broad
shoulder with the electricians, whose gray jerseys featured wild
bolts of electricity zigzagging down the back.</TE>
<TE>   "If Cesar Chavez was alive today, he's be working against
secession," said Irv Hershenbaum, a leader of the United Farm
Workers, who sported a straw hat for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   After the speeches, everyone poured into the noonday sun to gobble
down free hot dogs and chips. Some secessionists had suggested that
union members were paid to attend the rally, a charge that organizers
and many members denied.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had to pay us," said Manuel Morales, a janitor who left
his three children behind in Guatemala to seek work in the United
States. Now he scrubs bathrooms on the night shift at the CBS
television studios.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession will cut our benefits and our health insurance and
salaries," he said in Spanish. "We will not have as much strength
when we negotiate our contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Marc Reynolds, a cameraman who belongs to the International
Cinematographers Guild, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It would affect the economy in every way," he said. "If the
dockworkers can't make enough money to go see a movie, then the
producers aren't going to pay me to make a movie. It'll just be
another way for big corporations to divide and weaken us."</TE>

<HD>S.F. Airport Study Is Facing Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Runway expansion at San Francisco International Airport has hit
another snag with a proposed cut in funds to study the project.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin said a majority of board
members will vote Monday for his proposal to cut study funding from
$11.2 million to $6.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The money would pay for studies of different runway configurations
that include the possibility of filling in a portion of San Francisco
Bay.</LD>
<TE>   Airport officials said the cuts would hinder the environmental
review process, but Peskin said the money will be enough to complete
an environmental impact report, which must be finished before voters
consider any construction.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts also would nearly eliminate money for lawyers, and no
funds would be left to hire lobbyists or pay for public education,
said airport Director John Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion study is scheduled to be finished next year. It has
already cost almost $70 million.</TE>

<HD>Land Swap Could Lead to Reopening of Campground</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closed since 1995, Blue Point Campground near Piru could reopen by
2004 under a proposed land swap between the U.S. Forest Service and
the United Water Conservation District.</LD>
<LD>   If Congress approves the proposal by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi
Valley), the forest service would give the water district 420 acres,
including a parcel on the north side of Lake Piru that the water
district operates as a recreation area, and the 80-acre campground
six miles northwest of the lake.</LD>
<LD>   In return, the water district, which manages the Santa Clara River
and its tributaries, would give the federal agency 340 acres,
including western portions of Lisk Ranch, around the nine-mile Pot
Holes Trail. Both agencies say the land swap will help them
consolidate their holdings and better protect the endangered arroyo
toad that lives in the area.</LD>
<TE>   Doug West, recreation manager at Lake Piru, said he's excited
about the prospect of reopening the campground.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been all over the West, and for Southern California this is
probably one of the most pristine, beautiful spots I've been to," he
said. "You feel like you're in the Sierra when you're up there."</TE>
<TE>   Cloaked in chaparral, cottonwood and oaks, with a year-round,
trout-stocked creek, the 43-site campground was closed in 1995
because of concerns over the toad, West said.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 storm damaged much of Blue Point Road. Ultimately, the
forest service decided it lacked the resources to reopen and maintain
the campsite while protecting the frog.</TE>
<TE>   The water district believes it can do both, most likely by running
a shuttle to the campground to cut down on traffic. Rather than
paying a campsite fee, West said, campers probably would pay for
shuttle rides, up to $15 a person.</TE>
<TE>   Another option is for the water district to build a parking lot a
mile south of the campsite at the forest service's trail head, giving
hikers and campers a place to park but asking campers to walk to
their sites. That plan may encounter concerns over adequate
protection for the toad, West said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Emmens, forest lands officer for Los Padres National Forest,
said his agency and the water district plan to seek public input on
the trail, campsite and environmental concerns if Congress agrees to
the land exchange.</TE>

<HD>Dam Scam Sent L.A. County Supervisor Up the River</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crooked politicians in Depression-era Los Angeles found "easy
pickins" when they meshed their hunger for money with the arid
state's thirst for water.</LD>
<LD>   In what became known as the Great Forks Dam fiasco, and what
county Supervisor John Anson Ford called "the darkest episode" in the
history of Los Angeles County government, a county
supervisor--evidently the only one in modern times to go to prison
for corruption--was handed an envelope full of $1,000 bills on a
street corner the day after he persuaded his board colleagues to vote
for a huge cash payout to the contractor who paid him the bribe.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the early decades of the 20th century, the city of Los
Angeles was nationally notorious for its corrupt mayors, bagman cops
and dishonest politicians. But the county government had escaped this
bad PR--until 1933, when Supervisor Sidney T. Graves was clapped into
handcuffs, hauled into court and sent to San Quentin for bribery.</LD>
<TE>   Graves was a state assemblyman when he decided to run for county
supervisor in the late 1920s. Then as now there were only five
supervisors, and Graves won the 3rd District seat.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his supervisor's title and perks came committee
work--including the job as head of the rich and influential county
flood control district.</TE>
<TE>   Before Graves took office, voters had approved $25 million in
bonds to build a dam above Azusa and to lay $300,000 in railroad
tracks to reach the 12 miles from the Santa Fe Railway line to the
dam site. Boosters said the dam would be the world's largest concrete
structure, creating a reservoir with a water surface of eight square
miles.</TE>
<TE>   It was called the Forks Dam project, and somewhere along the line
Graves saw an opportunity for himself. Once the board gave the dam
building contract to a San Francisco construction firm and signed
off, Graves, as the man in charge of county flood control, was also
in charge of how the money was spent.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the beginning, the contractors used shoddy materials,
grossly overbilled the county and covered up engineering faults--and
Graves, according to the paper trail, began approving all that,
knowing it was substandard.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California was appalled to wake on the morning of March
13, 1928, and learn that the huge St. Francis Dam, north of Saugus,
had burst the night before, sending 12 billion gallons
of water down San Francisquito Canyon and killing 450 people. The disaster
was originally attributed to engineering errors, but later to an
undetected underground landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Out at the Forks Dam site, groundwork continued, and the first
shovelful of dirt was turned about a year after the St. Francis Dam
disaster. Although dam safety concerns were working their way through
the state Legislature, no laws would be passed until after the Forks
Dam construction was underway.</TE>
<TE>   County Chief Engineer E.C. Eaton reassured Graves and the other
supervisors that the Forks Dam site was safe, and so more than 600
workers, along with equipment and construction material, were taken
by rail to the site.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 16, 1929, up in Azusa Canyon, the earth roared, lurched
and shifted as tons of dirt and rock that had been excavated suddenly
shifted. Water and power lines and the new rail lines were destroyed.
The new west wall of the dam was crushed.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured in the landslide, because no one was working in
that area. The day before, Eaton had noticed earth movement there,
and had ordered the workers out. No one wanted another St. Francis
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   State engineers almost immediately revoked the county's permit to
build Forks Dam. Even though it was the state that had ordered the
project stopped, the contractors turned around and sued the county
for big money.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the contractors wanted to be reimbursed for
their equipment ruined in the landslide. But the problem was, the
equipment--with the blessing of Graves--had been appraised on paper
at much more than its actual value.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1930, the Board of Supervisors, urged on by Graves,
agreed to settle the suit and pay $830,000 to the contracting
firm--about eight times the worth of the lost equipment. And it
wasn't long before rumors of bribery and corruption began surfacing.</TE>
<TE>   The rumors reached the county's grand jury, which launched what
became a three-year closed-door probe by three special teams of
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   One team, curiously, was a private group called the Pomona
Taxpayers Protective Assn., which was enlisted by the grand jury to
sniff around the Azusa disaster. They joined forces with the grand
jury's own investigators and with a county-appointed team called the
"Minute Men": two attorneys, a geologist, a former U.S. Army engineer
and a businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Working together, the three groups ultimately uncovered an $80,000
cash "transfer" from the contracting company to Graves. On the day
after the Board of Supervisors voted to pay off the contractors to
the aforementioned tune of $830,000, Graves went to San Francisco,
where, on a street corner, he was handed his reward for getting the
vote: an envelope stuffed with 80 $1,000 bills.</TE>
<TE>   The three teams also found evidence of an attempted land swindle
orchestrated by Supervisor Hugh A. Thatcher. A friend of Thatcher's,
a wealthy orange-grower named Murray Vosburg, owned 800 acres in
Azusa below the dam site. It wasn't worth much until Thatcher tried
to persuade his fellow board members to buy the land as a "spreading
ground" for flood control--at eight times its real value. Thatcher
was never taken to trial, but lost his bid for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Graves went into court in 1933 with all his flags flying. He hired
celebrated attorney Jerry Giesler, who knew all about being a defense
attorney and said of his job: "My clients don't want justice: They
want off."</TE>
<TE>   Graves' good buddy, tongue-tied fellow supervisor and future Los
Angeles mayor Frank Shaw, helped his pal Graves by refusing to admit
anything on the stand. (There was speculation that Shaw had been on
the receiving end of some of those $1,000 bills.) Shaw was elected
L.A.'s mayor not long after Graves went to San Quentin, and four
years after that, he became the first American mayor to be recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of Giesler, prosecutor Eugene Williams' case swayed the
jury, and Graves was convicted of bribery for influencing the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Although the San Francisco contracting firm was also indicted for
allegedly offering the bribe, it was never brought to trial, for
which Dist. Atty. Buron Fitts was severely scourged by the city's
newspapers for "failure to perform his public duty."</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County Board of Supervisors and Chief Engineer Eaton got
off with press scoldings for the gross engineering mistakes and
mismanagement of funds.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred through all of this, the flood control agency found
another site to build a dam in the forest above Azusa. In 1935, the
new dam was christened the Prescott F. Cogswell Dam, in honor of the
county supervisor who was celebrated as the "father of flood
control." It was the first in a series of reservoirs that capture 210
square miles of mountain watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Graves was released from San Quentin in 1937, after serving three
years of a six-year sentence, and he had barely changed back into
civilian clothes when the federal government came down on him for tax
evasion: failing to report the $80,000 bribe as income.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted and sentenced to serve two years in federal
prison at Terminal Island. Graves died in 1958, at age 76.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---
This story has been edited to clarify a portion of the original
published text.  While flooding occurred early on the morning of March 13,
1928 the dam actually broke at 11:57 p.m. on March 12.

<DH>N. Hollywood: Families help plant 78 trees in memory of
those killed in the terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Holding a small American flag, Derrill Bodley gazed up at the
sunshine dappling the leaves of a young tree he had just planted in
crumbly, brown earth.</LD>
<LD>   "I can see my daughter's spirit taking root here already," he
said, nodding with approval.</LD>
<LD>   Bodley, a Stockton music professor whose 20-year-old daughter
Deora died when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania,
was one of about 200 relatives, friends and onlookers who paid
tribute Saturday in North Hollywood Park to the 78 Californians known
to have perished in the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Deora Bodley, a Santa Clara University psychology student, was
always searching for inner peace, and the graceful, silent tree
echoed that goal, her father said. "Now she has found that peace."</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, 78 saplings, each with a victim's name on a
fluttering tag, had been planted in a large grassy area where friends
and relatives gathered to reminisce about their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's not a body, you feel lost," said Martin Yamnicky,
37, of Torrance, whose father, John Yamnicky Sr., died on the plane
that slammed into the Pentagon. "This tree will give me a place to
come to."</TE>
<TE>   Sharyn Romano of the nonprofit Hollywood Beautification Team,
which spent seven months organizing the event and tracking down the
surviving families, said the site is "the only memorial we know of"
that honors the California victims individually and that attempted to
include all the families in a ceremony. Her group held a smaller
tree-planting event in April in Chico, and soil from there was
brought to North Hollywood Park to link the two sites.</TE>
<TE>   Trees were chosen to remember the victims because their sturdy
trunks and limbs reaching skyward represent life, longevity and
beauty, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   During a brief ceremony, Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge
said, "When you plant a tree, it lives and grows and it lasts beyond
our time."</TE>
<TE>   Tears welled up in the eyes of Gilberto Neira of Westchester as he
spoke about his 48-year-old wife, Laurie, who was killed on the first
plane to hit the World Trade Center. "It makes me feel better to know
that someone is carrying on the memory of the people who died," he
said. "I appreciate anything that's related to all the victims. They
deserve that much and more."</TE>
<TE>   For Brad Burlingame, the trees are a living reminder of "the many
acts of heroism that day." His brother, Charles F. Burlingame III,
piloted the jetliner that hit the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "These trees are part of that effort to communicate that
[heroism]--the stories of people who perished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The newly planted trees include jacarandas, camphor, gold
medallions, Canary Island pines and cedars. Flower beds and a plaque
bearing the names of all the California victims will be added to the
memorial, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those attending planted trees for people whose relatives
and friends could not attend.</TE>
<TE>   While planting one such tree, Diane Kalmonson, 56, of Laguna
Niguel reminisced about her niece Lauren Catuzzi Grandcola, 38, who
was "independent, appreciative of all she had, and very brave."
Grandcola died in the Pennsylvania crash.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the tag bearing the name of David Brandhorst Gamboa,
Kalmonson said she felt honored to be planting a tree for a victim
who was a complete stranger to her. "It's what Lauren would have
done."</TE>

<HD>County to Toss Wharf a Lifeline</HD>
<DH>Retail: A deal to buy back leases would be the beginning of
a five-year effort to revitalize a struggling section of Channel
Islands Harbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a tough six years for Joanna Steele, owner of a gift shop
and art gallery at Fisherman's Wharf in Channel Islands Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Steele watched the wharf's outdoor fish market, dining areas,
walkways and landscaping slowly slide into disrepair.</LD>
<LD>   She watched dispirited tenants close up shops, one by one. And she
watched nearly all the tourists disappear.</LD>
<TE>   The most frequent question she hears is, "Where did everybody go?"</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how hard it is to keep a smile on your face when
that's all we hear," said Steele, who has operated her tidy shop at
the same location for 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, Ventura County officials say, the retail
center's death spiral will soon be halted.</TE>
<TE>   In a rescue plan approved by supervisors last week, the county
will buy back leases for Fisherman's Wharf and the nearby 271-room
Casa Sirena hotel from owner Channel Islands Harbor Investment Co.
The Harbor Department plans to offer the leases to a new operator
willing to spend millions to rehabilitate the properties and keep
them maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Gross revenue at Fisherman's Wharf has dropped dramatically since
1995, from more than $4 million to $1 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say the area's slide began in 1996, when Channel
Islands Harbor Investment Co. took over long-term leases held by
former Oxnard developer Martin V. "Bud" Smith. The Texas-based
investors also took control of three harbor apartment complexes.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the hotel and wharf areas have fallen into disrepair
and tenant vacancies have increased, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "When Smith's leases were taken over by this other firm, they
simply--for whatever reason--were unable to do the things that they
should have done," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district
includes the harbor. "They lost a lot of subtenants. The harbor began
to sink because of lack of vitality."</TE>
<TE>   Channels Islands Harbor Investment officials were not available
for comment, but evidence of the area's decline was clearly visible
at lunchtime Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The five-acre wharf's huge parking lots were nearly empty. A
handful of visitors wandered the rows of colorful Cape Cod-style
shops and restaurants. Two homeless men slept on the ground, beside
cracked sidewalks and neglected planters.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new deal, Fisherman's Wharf will revert back to county
control as early as September. Channels Island Harbor Investment
agreed to pay the county $150,000, which will be plowed back into the
wharf area for cosmetic repairs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In a second phase, the Casa Sirena hotel and the adjoining Lobster
Trap restaurant will be put up for sale. County officials hope to
attract an owner willing to invest at least $9 million to renovate
the 30-year-old property.</TE>
<TE>   In return for assigning the leases back to the county, Channel
Islands Harbor Investment will extend 20-year leases on the
profitable apartment complexes to 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting a reputable developer to take on the aging properties
could prove challenging, experts say. Rick Caruso, developer of the
successful Promenade shopping center in Westlake, said applicants
will look closely at the density of surrounding neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It all comes down to the number of bodies that live in the area
that the harbor draws from," he said. "And we also look closely at
education and income levels. The higher the education level, the more
successful we know the project will be."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said potential developers would probably ask for tax breaks
and other concessions, if the project is not profitable on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these fisherman's wharves don't do that well because they
never have the anchor retail that draws the traffic in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County officials estimate it will take about five years to
complete both phases of the deal. But the public should start
noticing changes within a year, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have the opportunity to make the harbor what it should be
and what is has been--the jewel of Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   Diane Peisson agrees that the jewel needs polishing. On the way
home from San Diego, the Bay Area resident and her family stopped at
the Casa Sirena.</TE>
<TE>   But they were disappointed with the condition of their $99
waterfront room, Peisson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The deck was dilapidated. You could tell there was dry rot," she
said. "I hope they fix it up because it's a beautiful setting and a
good stopping point before L.A."</TE>

<HD>A Morally Repugnant Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE CRAWFORD</AU>
<BD>Bruce Crawford writes from Fountain Valley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In December 1953, Thurgood Marshall represented the NAACP in Brown
vs. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court. His purpose was
to expand the educational choices of black families by opening school
doors that the government had locked.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall said, "Distinctions by race are so evil, so arbitrary and
invidious that a state bound to defend the equal protection of the
laws must not involve them in any public sphere." Five years earlier
in Sipuel vs. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, he
argued, "Classification and distinction based on race or color have
no moral or legal validity in our society. They are contrary to our
Constitution and laws."</LD>
<LD>   Marshall's drive to open school doors to blacks was important to a
free society for two reasons. One, the essence of liberty is the
ability to exercise one's free will to make one's own choices. When
government expands our choices, it enhances our liberty. Two, a just
government is one that treats its citizens impartially. Therefore a
colorblind government moves us closer to a just government.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, the citizens of California voted to adopt a
constitutional initiative, Proposition 209, to make our government
more just by prohibiting it from making decisions based on race, sex,
color, ethnicity or national origin. It passed with 54% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Proposition 209 formally became part of the California
Constitution. With that, it superseded all prior state constitutional
and statutory laws, regulations and codes to the contrary, including
the state's education code.</TE>
<TE>   This, however, was irrelevant to the trustees and senior
administrators of the Huntington Beach Union High School District.
Despite the clear language of Proposition 209, which was patterned
after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it implemented in 1999 a
race-based transfer policy, which meant you could not transfer from
one school to another unless the school you were in was considered to
be properly balanced in racial makeup.</TE>
<TE>   The state education code rewards districts for having an open
transfer policy but refers to racial and ethnic balancing elsewhere.
The code therefore suggests that there should be no racial criteria
in moving from one school to another. Balancing has two problems.
One, Proposition 209 abolished the practice. Two, balancing is to be
done based on districtwide, not local school area, demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Two district schools, Ocean View and Westminster, have
demographics that differ from the district as a whole. These two
schools have a much higher proportion of minority residents,
primarily Asians and Latinos. Overall, the district has more whites.</TE>
<TE>   Students attending four high schools could transfer freely among
those schools that were considered "balanced," when their student
populations are more reflective of districtwide demographics. But the
doors were locked at "unbalanced" Ocean View and Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance doors at those two schools were locked to minorities;
the exit doors were locked to whites. In other words, the district's
policy turned Brown on its head. While Brown opened doors, expanded
choices, and advanced us toward a colorblind society under a more
just government, the district's transfer policy locked doors,
eliminated choices, established race as a criterion and made
government more arbitrary and unjust.</TE>
<TE>   The condition that the district abhors is not the segregation
Marshall fought. When the school system of Topeka, Kan., locked its
doors to Linda Brown in 1951, it was committing an act of
segregation.</TE>
<TE>   In the demographics of the two Huntington Beach school
populations, there is no intentional act. The conditions are not the
result of action by any party to separate specific groups from the
body of society. The demographics are the natural aggregation of
people having freely exercised their 1st Amendment right of
association and their economic right to buy or rent where they can
best afford.</TE>
<TE>   The district was not happy with the "unbalanced" natural results
of people having been free to choose. It used a tortured
interpretation of doctrine of equal protection to impose its
race-based transfer policy as a social remedy.</TE>
<TE>   The district was wrong in both law and principle. It ignored the
state Constitution, as amended by Proposition 209, to arrogantly
"protect" the people from the consequences of their own decisions. In
principle, this race-based transfer policy was morally repugnant,
just as Marshall argued in Sipuel.</TE>
<TE>   So I sued the district in 1999, with representation by the Pacific
Legal Foundation. On May 31, the 4th District Court of Appeal
unanimously voided a lower court's decision. The appellate court
decision read, 'We agree with [Crawford's] contention on appeal--that
the policy violates Proposition 209. Accordingly, we reverse the
judgment."</TE>
<TE>   The policy now is voided as it should have been.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling, by upholding Proposition 209, not only
reaffirmed the founding principles of rule of law and consent of the
governed but also enhanced our liberty, advanced us toward a more
colorblind society, and moved us closer to a more just, impartial
government.</TE>

<HD>Dorm Rules Spark Battle in Boston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAISY YU</AU>
<BD> Daisy Yu of Huntington Beach recently completed her
second year at Boston University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is common for college students to spend an entire weekend without
leaving their dorm buildings. Everything they need is conveniently
located down a flight of stairs: the laundry room, cafeteria, workout
room, computer lab, study lounge, even a smoking area.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, their best friends and classmates are just across the
hall or in the next room. College dorms are microcosms within the
school community. Each building often has its own administrative
staff and student councils that run the residence hall associations.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the year, these associations host barbecues and
coordinate community service activities to urge the residents to
become involved in their dorm and school life. Many universities
strongly encourage first-year students to live in the dorms. Some
even make this mandatory for incoming freshmen.</LD>
<TE>   With the alarming rate of student suicides at colleges around the
nation, parents and schools are eager to smooth the transition for
freshmen who choose to live away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the easy access to dorm amenities, new students are able
to better concentrate on their studies, instead of struggling to
decide what to make for dinner or to find a Laundromat.</TE>
<TE>   Dorm life, however, can become restrictive for students after
their first and second years. Most juniors and seniors cringe at the
thought of having to live in the controlled facility that their
parents and even they once craved as incoming college students.</TE>
<TE>   The constant hamburgers and hot dogs at lunchtime become
monotonous. The washers and dryers are always jammed. The elevators
are broken for weeks at a time. Nobody ever uses the workout room.
But the biggest complaint of many college students is a university's
dorm guest policy.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Boston University made the pages of the Boston Globe
when a student group titled BU Free presented a 78-page report to
university leaders. The proposal consisted of suggestions regarding
the policy of guest visitors written by both parents and students.</TE>
<TE>   Current policy at the university mandates that students who do not
live in a particular dorm cannot stay past midnight. Students are
also allowed only five overnight guests per semester. Furthermore,
the students must submit forms for overnight guests at least one day
in advance and by Thursday for weekend guests.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal calls for 24-hour access for Boston University
students to all dorms and an increase in the number of overnight
guest passes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the spring 2002 term has ended, talks between the Student
Union and Boston University President Jon Westling continue with no
word on whether the school will change its policy.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy heightened when Chancellor John Silber wrote a
letter to the student-run newspaper attempting to justify the current
policy. He wrote, "We imposed this [guest] policy to put an end to
the interruption of students' study time and sleep by roommates
thoughtless enough to bring their sexual partners to the room for
sessions of fun and games.</TE>
<TE>   "I had many complaints from students that they were unable to
sleep in their own dormitory rooms because of interference by
lovemaking roommates. Some of them found it offensive to be put in
the position of being voyeurs. Some, I suppose, were sufficiently
old-fashioned to suppose that intimate relationships should not be
engaged in as public performances."</TE>
<TE>   The bureaucracy of living in a dorm can be stifling, and the
argument relies on where the line between the university as a
learning institution and as a baby-sitter is drawn. However, Silber's
remark puts him in the position of parent and the students as
children.</TE>
<TE>   While students argued that an extended guest policy would allow
them to be able to conduct longer study sessions and project
meetings, Silber chose to focus on the logistics of a student's love
life.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to keep in mind that college students are adults.
Their personal lives are indeed personal.</TE>
<TE>   Living in a dorm is like living in a fantasy land. In the real
world, you do not need permission to study with your friend in her
room or have your roommate and another person from the opposite sex
approve that your boyfriend visit from New York.</TE>
<TE>   More and more students are searching for apartments where they can
control their diets and invite friends over without permission. Even
though apartments tend to be more expensive and subletting the rooms
in the summer can be complicated, it's worth it for the freedom the
university cannot offer in a dorm setting.</TE>
<TE>   While most first-year students enjoy the protection that the dorms
afford, older students realize that although they are living away
from home, they are not truly on their own. The battle over the guest
policy at one East Coast university makes that much clear.</TE>

<HD>Lackey Will Help in Doubleheader</HD>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Faced with a doubleheader on Monday against the Texas Rangers in
Arlington, and in the middle of a schedule that calls for 14 games in
13 days, the Angels will call up right-hander John Lackey from
triple-A Salt Lake to pitch Monday's second game.</LD>
<LD>   Lackey is 8-2 with a 2.57 earned-run average for Salt Lake.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of things I like about him," Manager Mike
Scioscia said of Lackey. "He has such an upside potential and he's
starting to realize it."</LD>
<TE>   The arrival of Lackey will necessitate a roster move. That's why
he's pitching in the second game. The Angels can make the move
between games, keeping whomever he replaces available for the first
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orel Hershiser, named pitching coach of the Rangers on Saturday,
received a hearty endorsement from Scioscia, his teammate on the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Orel is going to do a great job," Scioscia predicted. "He's a
great communicator. He can do everything from the front office down
to the field. He has always been a guy to use his influence to try to
make a young pitcher better. He would go out of his way to do so."</TE>

<TE>   Update--After winning five consecutive decisions over a span of
seven starts with a 2.95 ERA, Appier has lost his last five starts.
It isn't as if the Angel right-hander can blame the slide on bad
breaks or poor support. His ERA over that period is 8.31. Scioscia
blames the problem on mechanics. "He fights for consistency,"
Scioscia said. "He fights to be where he needs to be and that's
because of the delivery. It's in him, but he's not too far from where
he needs to be."</TE>

<LD>   Site: The Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Matchup: The Angels are the only AL team to use only five starters
this season, but they won't hold that distinction much longer.</TE>
<TE>   Playing 14 games in 13 days, they plan to recall right-hander John
Lackey from triple-A Salt Lake City to make his major league debut
during Monday's doubleheader, which was scheduled after the rainout
of the April 7 game. The Angels have dominated the Rangers this
season, winning six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Rodriguez, the Rangers' popular 30-year-old catcher, is
eligible for free agency after this season. He would like to spend
the rest of his career in Texas, but he's also is expected to seek at
least $15 million a season in his new contract. He's not likely to
get that from Ranger owner Tom Hicks, who is planning to slash the
team's $105-million payroll after this season. Rodriguez is in the
final year of a $42-million, five-year contract.</TE>

<TE>   Series: Friday, 7 p.m.; Saturday, 7 p.m.; Sunday, 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Site: Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Matchup: After beating the Dodgers in the series opener, 8-4, at
Dodger Stadium on June 14, the Angels dropped the next two games,
10-5 and 5-4. Their losing streak reached four games--the club's
longest since dropping six in a row in the second week of the
season--before they beat the Cardinals in St. Louis on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Angel right-hander Ramon Ortiz gave up four solo home runs to the
Dodgers, but those were the only hits he surrendered in the series
opener, pushing his complete-game total to three heading into this
weekend. The Angels scored six runs on seven hits in three innings
against Dodger starter Kazuhisa Ishii, handing the left-hander only
his second defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 14-15 against the Dodgers since the start of
interleague play, having won the series four games to two each of the
past two seasons. To equal that this season, it will take a sweep of
these three games at Edison Field, where the Angels hold a 7-6 edge.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chad Dukes and Greg Hopkins, free agents the Avengers had to convince
to play Arena League football in Los Angeles, played huge roles,
offensively and defensively, Saturday when they led the Avengers to a
62-32 victory over the Carolina Cobras before 11,706 at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   It was the largest margin of victory the Avengers (6-4) have
enjoyed in their brief history.</LD>
<LD>   Hopkins caught seven passes for 75 yards as a receiver. As a
linebacker, he had two interceptions against Aaron Sparrow of
Carolina (4-6). He returned the second one 37 yards for a touchdown
in the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Dukes, a fullback, ran for two touchdowns Saturday, including a
23-yarder in the second quarter. Playing linebacker, it was Dukes'
pressure on Sparrow that caused the quarterback to throw the pass
that Hopkins intercepted and returned for the score.</TE>
<TE>   Dukes and Hopkins aren't the only ones behind the Avengers'
success. Chris Jackson's remarkable season rolled on as he had eight
receptions for 135 yards and four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Graziani completed 16 of 21 passes for 206 yards and four
touchdowns before getting relieved by Matthew Sauk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other Arena League winners Saturday: the Chicago Rush, a 52-38
victor over the Detroit Fury, the Arizona Rattlers, a 54-21 winner
over the Indiana Firebirds, the Dallas Desperados, who defeated the
Tampa Bay Storm, 62-56, in overtime, and San Jose, which beat New
York, 65-41.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Jordan Feeling Right at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With school out for the summer in Atlanta, Pam Jordan has packed up
Briana, 10, Bryson, 8, and the two babies, Kenley, 18 months, and
Kaleb, 4 months, and they have joined Brian Jordan, husband and
father, at his Pasadena apartment, helping the Dodger left fielder
feel whole again.</LD>
<LD>   The new digs lack the spaciousness of their Atlanta house, but
family is important to Jordan, be it with relatives in the living
room or with teammates in the chemistry of the clubhouse, and he has
wrestled with his emotions for much of the first half--missing his
clan and pressing to do well with his new team.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Briana and Bryson romp in the dugout with other Dodger
offspring as their father prepares for the game and their mother gets
Kenley and Kaleb ready to join them at Dodger Stadium, with help from
Jordan's parents, who are visiting from Baltimore on the current
homestand and who have built a family foundation through almost 40
years of marriage.</LD>
<TE>   "They've been the glue," Brian Jordan said of Betty, a teacher,
and Alvin, a former steel worker who was determined that his two sons
not be exposed to the heat of the foundry.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Jordans stressed education, and it took.</TE>
<TE>   Brian graduated from the University of Richmond, where he met Pam,
who was in the process of becoming an All-American basketball player.
She now coaches Briana's AAU basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's brother and sister, the twins Deric and Felicia, both
graduated college. He is a drug rehabilitation counselor and she
works for the IRS, which prompts Jordan to laugh and say he shouldn't
be mentioning that or people will think he gets tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The education ledger was established early, and now, Brian said,
he and Pam are preaching it at home, just as he has helped educate
the Dodgers on the benefit of cohesiveness and competitive zeal. Or,
as Shawn Green said of the former Atlanta Falcon defensive back:</TE>
<TE>   "Brian brought more of a football mentality, a sense of going out
for battle. He's upbeat, full of life, and more vocal than anyone on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   "The chemistry has improved each of the three years I've been
here. It's like all of the changes each year have been designed to
fit a piece of the puzzle. Now the puzzle is pretty complete, and we
have to take the next step."</TE>
<TE>   Leadership was both the real and intangible element in the trade
that brought Jordan and Odalis Perez from the Atlanta Braves for Gary
Sheffield, and it was in the first week of the new season that the
Dodgers got an early dose of it.</TE>
<TE>   Disturbed by San Francisco's sweep of the opening series, Jordan
called a players-only meeting to explore where his new teammates'
heads were and make sure what he had seen from the Dodgers when he
was still with the Braves wasn't going to be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd look in their dugout and there was no emotion," Jordan said.
"There was no chemistry, no sense of guys pulling for each other. It
was like they were all separatists. Then I got here and guys told me
how everything was in turmoil last year, that they didn't even enjoy
coming to the park."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it wasn't turmoil, and maybe it's a stretch to suggest that
Sheffield was a constantly ticking time bomb.</TE>
<TE>   But there was at least one dugout face-down between Green and
Sheffield, and always the sense that the lid was about to come off
Sheffield's festering unhappiness at being dropped behind Green in
the batting order and the Dodgers' refusal to extend his contract.
There was always the sense that Sheffield was working the clubhouse,
looking for a key ally, one minute trying to unite with Eric Karros
against Green or with Green against Karros.</TE>
<TE>   If that hornet's nest is several miles closer to blue heaven now,
Jordan and his belief in family deserve considerable credit.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that we're having fun, nobody is looking over their
shoulder, everyone is on the top step pulling for each other and
showing emotion, which they haven't always done here, and even the
guys who don't play regularly and could on other teams have been
awesome," Jordan said. "That's chemistry. That's why I'm so happy
with our performance so far. Maybe we're headed for a parade, too."</TE>
<TE>   And what is the key element Jordan thinks he has contributed to
that?</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing is that I feel like I brought a winning attitude,"
he said. "I've been there, done that. I've played for winners, and
I've also seen what can happen to a team when there's jealousy. I
told [Manager Jim Tracy] when I got here and he asked me where I
wanted to hit in the lineup that it didn't matter. If I'm hitting
fourth and hot, leave me there. If I'm not, pull me back and put the
hot man there.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever it takes to win. That's the attitude I bring. I lead by
example, but I'm not afraid to speak up."</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, Jordan has averaged 23 homers and 95 runs
batted in while batting .290. He entered the weekend batting .283
with production projections of 25 homers and 87 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is confident his numbers will improve with warmer weather.
Then again, playing all out at age 35, he occasionally requires rest.</TE>
<TE>   As Sheffield battles injuries and helps power the Braves into
their customary lead in the NL East, the Dodgers are one game back of
Arizona in the West, prospering from the pitching of Perez (8-3) and
the varied contributions of Jordan, who still regards the trade as a
shock that came without warning.</TE>
<TE>   One day he is taking batting practice at Turner Field, the next he
is getting a call telling him he has been traded.</TE>
<TE>   One day he is home for Kabel's delivery, the next in Vero Beach
for the start of spring training with a new team. One day he is
moving into the Pasadena apartment, the next his truck is broken into
and he is thinking, "Man, this is not for me."</TE>
<TE>   "That first month was a tough go," he said. "Missing family.
Trying too hard with a new team. Put myself in a hole from the start.
But as time went on, I got a lot of support from my teammates, guys
like Marquis [Grissom], who also lives in Atlanta and knows what it
is to be separated, and I feel like I've started to come back, to be
myself again.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's great to have the family here. My son is out there for
batting practice [in his custom Dodger uniform] and I even let my
daughter hit in the cage today. It's memorable. Historic Dodger
Stadium. It's an experience none of us will ever forget."</TE>
<TE>   How long it continues is a question Jordan won't confront until
the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   As a player traded with a multi-year contract (he makes $6 million
this year, $9 million next and has a $10.5 million option or $2.5
million buyout in 2004), he can demand a trade at the end of the
season. For now, Jordan said, he doesn't want to put added pressure
on himself or General Manager Dan Evans, although if Evans broached
the idea of an extension "I'm quite sure my wife would say, 'Fine,
let's get a place out here instead of an apartment.' "</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Jordan said, laughing, "It's a zoo. I mean, we have a
big house in Atlanta and I can get away from the kids and get all the
sleep I want. Now, there's nowhere to go when the babies start crying
and Briana and Bryson start pulling the blankets off. I keep teasing
Pam that I'm going to send them home because I need to sleep so I can
play."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan would never send them home. Even the once divisive Dodgers
seem to grasp his message regarding family values.</TE>

<HD>Hershiser Is Hired as Coach by Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orel Hershiser, a former Cy Young Award winner with no prior coaching
experience, was hired Saturday to replace the fired Oscar Acosta as
the Texas Rangers' pitching coach.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge to the former Dodger ace is obvious: Make something
out of a pitching staff that traditionally is one of the worst in the
majors.</LD>
<LD>   Acosta was fired Thursday, less than a year after he was fired
from the same job by the Chicago Cubs, because of apparent
communications problems with Manager Jerry Narron and Ranger
pitchers.</LD>
<TE>   Hershiser, 42, plans to go slowly in making changes. But he will
try to develop relationships with the pitchers that the outspoken
Acosta apparently couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident in my ability to communicate the game to a lot of
different people who have a lot of different makeups," Hershiser
said. "I'm confident I can be a quick study and get up to speed
quickly with the staff and with this job."</TE>
<TE>   Hershiser was 204-150 with a 3.48 earned-run average in 18 seasons
and won the National League Cy Young award with the 1988 World Series
champion Dodgers. He set a major league record with 59 consecutive
scoreless innings that season.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't like to blow your own horn about who you are and what
your makeup is, but I think you'll see a pretty positive guy and
somebody who's really going to try to encourage guys," Hershiser
said. "Even though I haven't coached a day, I've got a chance that
they're going to believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Hershiser discussed the job before joining the Rangers as a
special assistant to General Manager John Hart in the fall. At the
time, Hershiser did not want to make a full-time commitment, but
changed his mind Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati left-hander Gabe White was released from a Cincinnati
hospital, one day after his infected pitching hand swelled so badly
that he couldn't move his fingers.</TE>
<TE>   White will have to continue getting intravenous antibiotics for
several more days, leaving the Reds without a left-hander in the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   White had the type of infection that could result in amputation if
not caught in time, Dr. Timothy Kremchek said. It apparently started
with an insect bite on the side of the hand.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bob Boone drove White home from the hospital after the
pitcher was released sooner than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "He was standing up out of bed and needed a ride home," Boone
said. "He looked real good. He was in real good spirits and walked
out of there fine."</TE>

<HD>Street Closes Deal as Texas Wins Title</HD>

<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Texas closer Huston Street has his own national championship story to
share with his dad.</LD>
<LD>   The son of former Texas quarterback James Street, who helped lead
the Longhorns to a Cotton Bowl victory in 1970, carried the baseball
team Saturday to its fifth College World Series title.</LD>
<LD>   But he wasn't about to flaunt it after the Longhorns beat South
Carolina, 12-6, even with a CWS-record four saves.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'll ever have bragging rights with my dad,"
Street said. "Everything I am is because my dad taught it to me."</TE>
<TE>   The victory made Texas Coach Augie Garrido the first to win the
CWS with two schools and gave Texas its first title since 1983. It
also tied Texas (57-15) with Louisiana State and Arizona State for
second on the list of CWS titles, behind USC's 12.</TE>
<TE>   "These players are the very best at what they are doing in the
sport right now," Garrido said. "This national championship went to a
group that really deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   Street, a 6-foot freshman from Austin, Texas, pitched 6 1/3
innings in his four appearances, allowing one run on two hits with
five strikeouts and three walks.</TE>
<TE>   Street was voted outstanding player for the series and became the
first freshman to get the honor since Pat Burrell of Miami in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Texas' hero was outfielder Chris Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael, who was making his first start in nearly a month, hit
a three-run homer in the fifth inning that broke the game open for
the Longhorns. It was just the second homer of the season for
Carmichael, who didn't know he was going to start until just before
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good and I felt like I was having fun, during batting
practice especially," Carmichael said. "I don't know what it was. I
thought I'd take this good feeling into the game."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth title for Garrido, who won three at Cal State
Fullerton before going to Texas.</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers used the long ball and some little ball to defeat the Red
Sox, 5-4, on Saturday, erasing a 3-0 fourth-inning deficit to move a
season-high 17 games over .500 and clinch their eighth consecutive
series victory.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Green blasted his 22nd home run in the fourth inning, a
two-run shot off Boston starter Derek Lowe that traveled an estimated
446 feet to right field and extended his monthlong hot streak.</LD>
<LD>   Since May 21, Green leads major leaguers with 19 home runs, and in
his last 29 games, the right fielder is batting .376 (41 for 109)
with 19 homers and 37 runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   Second baseman Alex Cora doubled to lead off the fifth and tested
Boston left fielder Rickey Henderson's arm on Cesar Izturis' ensuing
single. Though Henderson got to the ball before Cora rounded third,
his throw was wide of home plate and Cora scored the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis alertly took second on the throw and, after Omar Daal's
sacrifice bunt, he scored the go-ahead run on Dave Roberts' infield
single. The Dodgers made it 5-3 in the sixth when Green walked, took
third on Eric Karros' hit-and-run single and scored on Marquis
Grissom's fielder's choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our base-running today was as good as it's been all year," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said. "We were looking to take the extra base, we
went from first to third. I'm very pleased with the way our team is
playing baseball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek was ejected in the third inning
after arguing umpire Kerwin Danley's ruling that he ran too far
inside the first-base line on a slow roller toward the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Cora, who lost his starting shortstop job to Izturis in spring
training but is batting .324 with two homers, three triples, five
doubles and 12 runs in a reserve role, replaced Grudzielanek and
played a significant part in the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He could have put his head in the sand, been disappointed and
handled the situation differently [when he lost his job]," Tracy said
of Cora. "Instead, he did the correct thing--he handled it like a
consummate professional. I respect that, and his teammates respect
that, and he's come up huge whenever he's called upon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Darren Dreifort, who is rehabilitating from
his second elbow reconstruction surgery, is scheduled to throw live
batting practice Tuesday. Dreifort has been throwing in the bullpen
for about a month, and he extended himself to 67 pitches during
Friday's session.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have signed second-round pick Zachary Hammes, a
6-foot-2, 220-pound high school pitcher from Iowa, to a $750,000
bonus. Hammes, a right-hander whose fastball has been clocked in the
94-mph range, will report to the Dodgers' rookie-league team in Vero
Beach, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Barrera Gets Some Payback</HD>
<DH>Boxing: He wins a close but unanimous decision over Morales
in Las Vegas, handing Mexican rival his first setback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In the months and days leading up to his featherweight championship
fight with Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera engaged his countryman
and rival in a slew of mind games.</LD>
<LD>   He'd alternate insults and praise, ethnic slurs and back-handed
compliments, all of which served to further anger the Tijuana-born
Morales.</LD>
<LD>   Barrera, Mexico City's favorite son, even said he had trained for
a 12-round fight, though he also intimated that he needed to knock
out the Top Rank-promoted Morales to get a win in Las Vegas, Top
Rank's home base.</LD>
<TE>   Turns out Barrera didn't need Morales counted out Saturday night.
He won a unanimous, though disputed, decision, at the MGM Grand
Garden Arena with judge Chuck Giampa scoring it 116-112, and judges
Mike Glienna and Duane Ford having it 115-113. The Times scored the
fight 116-112 in favor of Barrera, as did the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Many ringside observers had it much closer. At the center of the
controversy was a non-knockdown call made by referee Jay Nady after
Barrera went down to a knee on a Morales body shot toward the end of
the seventh round, a round all three judges gave to Barrera, 10-9.</TE>
<TE>   Nady said Morales had stepped on Barrera's foot, sending him down.
Indeed, had Nady allowed for a knockdown, the round would have been
scored 10-8 in favor of Morales and Morales would have won a split
decision with Glienna's and Ford's scorecards in favor of him,
114-113.</TE>
<TE>   "The referee was awful," said Morales, who suffered a nasty cut on
the bridge of his nose in the second round and had his right eye
nearly swollen shut by an overhand right in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "[Nady] allowed him to do a lot of low blows and a lot of elbows,
as always, and he never took a point away."</TE>
<TE>   With his first career loss, Morales (41-1) lost his World Boxing
Council 126-pound title (it is now vacant), as well as a big payday
in the fall against Paulie Ayala.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera, whose face was pristine, save for a scratch under his
right eye, did not pay sanctioning fees to the WBC for the fight and
was instead awarded a world championship belt by Ring Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a close fight," said Barrera, who avenged his
split-decision loss to Morales from Feb. 19, 2000, to improve to
55-3. "I did my job. I came in to outbox him."</TE>
<TE>   How close was the fight? Barrera threw 607 punches and landed 207
of them, 34%. Morales threw 599 punches and landed 205, 34%.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera landed more jabs and at a higher percentage (90 of 278,
32%) than Morales (70 of 265, 26%) while Morales was more adept at
power punches (135 of 334, 40% to 117 of 329, 36%).</TE>
<TE>   And while the rematch of the 2000 fight of the year did not live
up to the original's frenetic pace, it was a hotly contested affair
... at times.</TE>
<TE>   With a World Cup atmosphere--Mexican flags, Spanish-language
chants, derisive whistles--Barrera's strategy early on was to stay
away and not trade punches with the heavy-hitting Morales.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same stall-and-frustrate strategy Barrera used to
perfection against Prince Naseem Hamed last year.</TE>
<TE>   Morales was aggravated and angered by the tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "Like in the first fight, I controlled the fight," Morales said.
"He didn't do anything the first six or seven rounds. He thought I
was going to run out of gas."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Montiel (24-0-1, 18 knockouts) won the World Boxing
Organization super-flyweight title by dealing Pedro Alcazar (25-1-1)
his first professional loss with a sixth-round technical knockout.
Montiel, the WBO's 112-pound champion, will vacate that title and
instead keep the 115-pound championship.</TE>
<TE>   Lightweight prospect Miguel Cotto (10-0, eight KO's) continued his
rapid and impressive ascent with a fifth-round TKO of one-time
contender Justin Juuko.</TE>

<LD>There is one 2002 Breeders' Cup winner you can put a circle around
right now.</LD>
<LD>   Provided Azeri stays healthy, she will be close to impossible to
beat in the Breeders' Cup Distaff on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-10 favorite in the $250,000 Vanity Handicap on Saturday at
Hollywood Park, Azeri had no trouble handling 125 pounds, the highest
impost of her eight-race career, and her four rivals.</LD>
<TE>   After making the lead without encouragement from jockey Mike
Smith, the 4-year-old Jade Hunter filly cruised to her fourth
consecutive Grade I victory and her seventh win overall.</TE>
<TE>   At the wire, she had three lengths on 7-2 second choice Affluent,
who has been second to her in three consecutive races. Azeri
completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   The filly is expected to have two more starts before the Breeders'
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye was not seriously hurt, but he took off
his final two mounts after being involved in a spill in the sixth
race.</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye was riding Jorrocks when the 8-year-old gelding
apparently suffered a fatal heart attack in the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   A necropsy will be performed on Jorrocks, who had won 11 of 56 and
earned $221,741, to determine the exact cause of death.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Lilly sure knows how to take advantage of his time in the New
York Yankee rotation.</LD>
<LD>   When Andy Pettitte was on the disabled list because of elbow
tendinitis, Lilly took his place and threw a one-hitter. With Orlando
Hernandez still sidelined Saturday because of a strained back, Lilly
pitched for the first time in two weeks and was brilliant again.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly (3-5) pitched a three-hitter and struck out a career-high 11
for his first major league shutout, and the Yankees defeated the San
Diego Padres, 1-0, at San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Lilly knows he doesn't need to prove anything to Manager Joe
Torre.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gives me the ball, I'm happy to take it," Lilly said.</TE>
<TE>   While Lilly gave the Yankee bullpen a badly needed rest, New York
spoiled the big league debut of right-hander Jake Peavy (0-1) in
front of 60,021, the biggest in baseball this year.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano doubled on Peavy's first pitch and scored on Jason
Giambi's double. Peavy, 21, gave up three hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best moment of my life when I walked off the field to
a standing ovation," Peavy said. "It was awesome. I knew that my job
wasn't to be awestruck by it, but to come out and pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Arizona 3--Vernon Wells hit a two-run homer and Raul
Mondesi hit a tiebreaking double at Phoenix, and the Blue Jays
dropped the Diamondbacks into a tie with the Dodgers for first place
in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, Seattle 2--Jeff Bagwell, out of the starting lineup
after the death of St. Louis Cardinal pitcher and former Astro
teammate Darryl Kile, hit a game-winning, pinch-hit single in the
12th inning at Houston. Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Brad Ausmus, among
Kile's best friends when he pitched for Houston from 1991-97, did not
take batting practice and did not start. Kile's Astro jersey--No.
57--hung in the Houston dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, San Francisco 2--Marty Cordova hit his third homer in
less than 24 hours to support 30-year-old rookie Travis Driskill
(5-0), who gave up two runs and six hits in five innings. All of his
victories have come on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 10, Cincinnati 3--Barry Zito (10-2) got his ninth
consecutive victory, and Olmedo Saenz hit a two-run double and a solo
homer at Cincinnati, sending the Reds to a season-high loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Montreal 4--Bartolo Colon (10-4) gave up nine hits
and two runs in eight innings at Montreal, and ended the Expos'
eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 15, Chicago White Sox 2--Rafael Furcal's three-run homer
capped a seven-run fourth inning at Atlanta, where Paul Konerko
provided Chicago's runs with two home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 3, Pittsburgh 2--Ivan Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run
with a double in the seventh inning and the Rangers overcame a
two-run deficit at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Philadelphia 1--Pinch-hitter Matthew LeCroy looped a
go-ahead double to spark a three-run outburst with two out in the
11th inning at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, New York Mets 1--Raul Ibanez homered and drove in
four runs at New York to help the Royals end an eight-game skid.
Pedro Astacio (7-3) gave up four runs and four hits, and left after
Ibanez's double put the Royals ahead, 4-1, in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, Tampa Bay 5--Todd Hollandsworth's single to left field
in the 11th inning drove in Todd Helton with one out at Denver. Tampa
Bay's Randy Winn had four hits and was a homer short of hitting for
the cycle.</TE>

<HD>As a Career Ends, the Memories Begin</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: McCarron reflects on his favorite horses
during a 29-year career, which ends today at Hollywood Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris McCarron and his longtime agent, Scotty McClellan, obviously
couldn't ride all the horses. For 22 years--the last 22 of McCarron's
29-year career--they picked their spots as best they could, and
sometimes the spots picked them. When that happened, when McCarron
got his foot in the door with an important horse, he didn't have to
ride the animal twice to know what to do.</LD>
<LD>   There's a long list of instant McCarron successes with horses that
he got to ride for the first time after they were well along in their
careers. As McCarron, 47, puts a period--or more appropriately an
exclamation point--on his career today at Hollywood Park, he can look
back on Sunday Silence, Go For Gin, Danzig Connection, Pine Bluff,
Forty Niner, Life's Magic, Flawlessly, Bayakoa, Estrapade, Winning
Colors, Miss Alleged and Mom's Command as horses who fell into that
category.</LD>
<LD>   There are McCarron-ridden Kentucky Derby, Preakness, Belmont
Stakes and Breeders' Cup winners among that collection, but before
any of them there was John Henry. By 1983, the unwanted gelding had
already won one horse-of-the-year title and earned $3.6 million. He
had been ridden by 17 jockeys, none of them McCarron.</LD>
<TE>   Going into 1983, the 8-year-old John Henry belonged to jockey Bill
Shoemaker, another old-timer. Shoemaker, past 50, had gotten to John
Henry late, but, like McCarron would eventually do, he seized the
opportunity. In 1981, the year of John Henry's first national title,
Shoemaker took over and rode him to wins in the first Arlington
Million, on grass, and on dirt in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont
Park in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of 1982, John Henry's career appeared to be in
free-fall. He had finished first in only one race all year, and in
November there was the ill-advised Japan Cup trip to Tokyo, where he
became seriously ill and lost lots of weight while in quarantine.</TE>
<TE>   Come mid-1983, however, trainer Ron McAnally told Shoemaker that
John Henry was whole again, but Shoemaker was making other plans. He
had linked himself with the wealthy Allen Paulson, an aerospace
magnate who was forming what would become a powerful stable. For John
Henry's seasonal debut, McAnally picked the American Handicap on the
Fourth of July at Hollywood Park, but Shoemaker chose to ride The
Wonder for Paulson; the mount on John Henry went to McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   The Wonder, favored in the race, finished next to last while
McCarron rode John Henry to a 1 1/4-length victory, the horse's first
win in eighth months. McCarron's run with John Henry went on until
the horse's retirement at the end of 1984: 14 races, eight wins,
almost $4 million in purses and a second horse-of-the-year title.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not as though there weren't some hiccups along the way.
The second time McCarron rode John Henry was in the '83 Arlington
Million, and the other day, as he recounted the mountains he had
climbed, the 47-year-old jockey mentioned that race as "one I'd like
to have back."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to win thoroughbred racing's first million-dollar race for
the second time, John Henry was the 7-5 favorite. The only other
early speed in the race was Nijinsky's Secret, and McCarron had John
Henry just behind that horse from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting on a ton of horse," McCarron said, "but knowing
what I know now, I should have moved sooner. I was too patient."</TE>
<TE>   Running along the fence, Nijinsky's Secret lugged out in the last
sixteenth of a mile, forcing John Henry out as well. A European
longshot, Tolomeo, found room inside as the leaders drifted. If John
Henry could eyeball a rival, he could usually outrun him, but while
he saw Nijinsky's Secret and thought he had him measured, he didn't
see Tolomeo with his late move along the rail. At 38-1, Tolomeo beat
McCarron's horse by a neck.</TE>
<TE>   Many jockeys might have cursed their luck and moved on. Not
McCarron. He was 28 and already in the firmament, having won Eclipse
Awards as an apprentice and a journeyman, but he sagely turned this
defeat into a learning experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered that day that getting to know the horse you're
riding can be crucial in a spot like that," McCarron said. "John
Henry wasn't a horse like Precisionist, he didn't have that abrupt
turn of foot. He was more of what I like to call a momentum builder.
Losing that Million taught me a great deal. The experience stuck with
me. I was able to put it to use in the same race the next year."</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Nijinsky's Secret again ran in the Arlington
Million, but this time McCarron was careful not to let him get in the
way. An unimpeded John Henry won by 1 3/4 lengths, giving McCarron
his first of 21 victories in races worth $1 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "If ever there was a race that went like the blueprint, that was
one," McCarron said.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, after McCarron stunned the racing community with his
retirement announcement, he named John Henry, along with Sunday
Silence, Alysheba, Tiznow, Precisionist, Free House, Paseana,
Flawlessly and Flying Paster as the best he has ridden. By Friday, he
seemed to have whittled that list down to John Henry, Alysheba and
Tiznow.</TE>
<TE>   "John Henry had such a following," McCarron said. "Whenever he
ran, more people by the thousands would come out just because he was
in the race."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron had ridden in six Kentucky Derbys without a victory
before Alysheba came along in 1987. Pat Day, who had ridden Alysheba
early in the year, had Demons Begone to ride in the Derby. Trainer
Jack Van Berg took a chance with McCarron, who had broken a leg in
four places in a five-horse pileup at Santa Anita the previous fall
and hadn't ridden for six months until he returned in mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Alysheba might have been another of those classic McCarron
first-timers--but the stewards at Keeneland took the Van Berg horse's
number down after an apparent victory in the Blue Grass. Nine days
later, Alysheba, clipping Bet Twice's heels, survived a stumble in
the stretch to win the Derby by three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't sink in till later about how bad a spill that
potentially could have been," McCarron said. "There were 16 horses
behind us. That could have really been a mess. But Alysheba stayed up
and he got me that first [of two Derbys]. As we jocks like to say, he
got the monkey off my back."</TE>
<TE>   Before 2000, McCarron had won the Breeders' Cup Classic three
times--with Alysheba, Alphabet Soup and Sunday Silence, the only time
he rode him--but a California-bred had never won a Breeders' Cup
race. At Churchill Downs, Tiznow and the red-haired rider changed all
that, holding off Giant's Causeway by a neck. Then last year, at
Belmont Park, Tiznow and McCarron beat Sakhee by a nose in another
thriller, giving McCarron a record fifth Classic victory and making
Tiznow the first horse to win the race twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiznow helped prove that a 46- or 47-year-old rider could still
win in a pressure situation, in a very competitive race," McCarron
said. "I began riding him the middle of his 3-year-old year. It's
very rewarding to see horses in your hands progress the way they
sometimes do."</TE>
<TE>   After 34,229 races, today McCarron will use Came Home, a
3-year-old colt, as the outside bookend to a remarkable career. The
bookends begin with Most Active, who ran last on Jan. 24, 1974, in
Bowie, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, has known only one
rider. But after the Affirmed Handicap, he's on his own.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Passes on Learning Curve</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SONOMA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>One of the rules of having a successful business career is to never
beat your boss at cards or golf.</LD>
<LD>   If that is true, it should be worse if you beat a potential boss
just when he was considering hiring you.</LD>
<LD>   That's what Jimmie Johnson, the hottest rookie in NASCAR's
prestigious Winston Cup, did after nervously approaching four-time
champion Jeff Gordon for some guidance while driving in the Busch
Grand National series two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just amazing how it all fell together so fast, hiring Jimmie
and building a new team with Rick Hendrick," Gordon said while here
for today's Dodge/Save Mart 350 Winston Cup race, one of two road
course events on the 36-race schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "We were building a new race shop and Rick and I had been
discussing the idea of having a two-car team, the way Joe Gibbs had
with Tony [Stewart] and Bobby [Labonte]. It was only in the
discussion stage when I went to Michigan to drive my Busch car in
August.</TE>
<TE>   "In the driver's meeting, Johnson was in front of me and he turned
around and asked if we could talk for a few minutes. He said several
teams had been talking to him and he wanted some advice. I told him I
thought he needed another year in Busch before making the jump.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, in the race, he was behind me with five or six laps to go
when we had a restart and he passed me. At first, I was really mad.
Then I started thinking about how smart he was driving, smooth yet
very aggressive, and I told Rick about it. Rick said he had had an
eye on him after seeing Johnson in races with Rick's son Ricky.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to go after him and start a two-car team. We didn't
have a crew, and we didn't have a sponsor, but we had a driver.
Looking back, it was much like it was when Hendrick hired me in
1992."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that pass of Gordon at Michigan was one of the
highlights of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "To pass a champion like Jeff so early in my career meant a lot to
me, and coming the way it did the day after our conversation, made it
all the sweeter," Johnson said after posting a qualifying lap of
92.404 mph on Friday. "I hoped it would impress him, I guess it did."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was driving for William Herzog and Herzog Motorsports at
the time, with another year on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, he signed with Gordon and Hendrick for 2002
but fulfilled his 2001 contract with Herzog by driving another year
in the Busch series.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson will start 15th in today's 112-lap race of 350 kilometers
(224 miles) around the 10-turn, two-mile road course at the renamed
Infineon Raceway, the former Sears Point. Gordon qualified fourth at
93.141, behind defending champion Stewart, Kurt Busch and Jeff
Burton.</TE>
<TE>   The two-car team of California products is the most successful in
NASCAR at the moment. Gordon, 30, the veteran from Vallejo, and
Johnson, 26, the rookie from El Cajon, are tied for second after 15
races, only 110 points back of Sterling Marlin.</TE>
<TE>   Both drive Chevrolet Monte Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   The precocious Johnson surprised himself and his backers with how
quickly his remarkable career started. In the season's opening race,
he won the pole for the Daytona 500 and since then has won races at
California Speedway and Dover, Del., and poles at Talladega, Ala.,
and the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Speedway in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning the pole at Daytona was easier than I thought it would
be," Johnson said. "I can't take credit for it, though. With all the
resources we have at Hendrick Motorsports, all I had to do was mash
the gas."</TE>
<TE>   His performance might have been more gratifying to Gordon than to
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were searching for a sponsor for the [No.] 48 car, we had
to work overtime. We had five or six meetings with the people at
Lowe's and I was making so many promises about how Jimmie would do
that Rick looked over at me and laughed when he said, 'You know,
you're the one responsible for him now.'</TE>
<TE>   "I felt there was something about Jimmie that reminded me of
myself at that stage and I was confident he would be a big success,
although not this soon."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick and Gordon are co-owners of both the 24 car that Gordon
drives and the 48 of Johnson's.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to answer any questions Jimmie has about driving,"
Gordon said, "but I feel my main role is helping him out with all the
stuff off the race track, things like scheduling and PR and answering
to sponsors, fans and the media. All that stuff can really cut into
your focus and after going through it myself I think I can make it
easier for Jimmie."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrick, who plucked Gordon from the Busch ranks when he was only
20, said he became sold on Johnson "because he reminded me so much of
Jeff at that stage."</TE>
<TE>   Both drivers came from non-stock car backgrounds. Gordon drove
sprint cars and midgets in hopes of moving up to Indy cars, but when
no opportunities arose he turned to stock cars. Johnson is a product
of off-road racing, having won three Mickey Thompson Stadium
championships and the 1994 SCORE desert championship.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson says he is comfortable when he beats his boss or when they
are fighting for the same space on the race track.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not been difficult for the reason that Jeff is very secure
with who he is and what he has accomplished," said Johnson. "I've
heard him say a couple times if he is going to lose to somebody--not
that he wants to, by any means--he would like it to be one of his
teammates."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Johnson and Gordon, Hendrick Motorsports fields
cars for Terry Labonte and Joe Nemechek.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the key part is that he is as willing and giving as he is
in this situation," Johnson said of Gordon, "because if he wasn't it
could very easily be a bad situation."</TE>
<TE>   Today will be Johnson's first Winston Cup road race. When he
tested here in April, he was the fastest among a group of drivers
that included Ryan Newman, his chief rival for rookie of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent some time in the driving school here when I was about 15,
but this was the first time I'd been here in a Cup car," Johnson
said. "I like getting back to turning right as well as left, and
downshifting and using the brakes. It reminds me of racing off-road
trucks in the desert. That's where I learned to race and there is
something about the challenge of trying to control a race car at high
speeds while going over extremely rough terrain.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's extra nice to know that Jeff won three times here and we
have all the settings from his car. That's a nice security blanket."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon won six consecutive road races at Sonoma and Watkins Glen,
N.Y., before finishing third here last year behind Stewart and Robby
Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   "We drove the same car in all those races and even though we won
last August at Watkins Glen, it was mainly because Robby dropped out,
so we decided we needed a new car for here," Gordon said. "It's nice
to know that we have the old one as a backup. I'm sure there are
probably 40 teams in the paddock that would love to have it as their

<TE>   Road racing specialist Jim Inglebright won his third consecutive
NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series race Saturday at Infineon Raceway
when he brought his Chevrolet from 19th place to edge Kenny Shepherd
and Eric Holmes in the Snap-On Tools/Jelly Belly 200.</TE>
<TE>   Inglebright dominated the first 11 laps, pulling off to a big lead
before pitting with a missing engine. Before he resumed the race, 18
cars had passed him. He regained the lead again when he passed
Shepherd on lap 62 of the 64-lap race.</TE>
<TE>   None of the three Winston Cup regulars, Robby Gordon, Jeff Green
and Kevin Harvick, were running at the finish.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Draft Will Provide Few Solutions for Most Teams</HD>

<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, as Shaquille O'Neal points his Jet Ski for the middle of the lake
adjoining his palatial Orlando summer home in an attempt to become
the largest man to hit 100 mph on water, we turn our attention to the
rest of the league, which has all it can do to catch up with him.</LD>
<LD>   Not that Wednesday's draft figures to change the hierarchy (1.
Lakers, 2. Sacramento, 3. San Antonio, 4. Dallas, 5. Minnesota, 6.
tie among Utah, Seattle and East champion). However, it kicks off
what promises to be 15 months of frenetic player movement, not to
mention possible team movement, with the Timberwolves petitioning to
switch conferences with the New Orleans (ne Charlotte) Hornets.</LD>
<LD>   This, of course, would be a dangerous precedent. If granted, 12
more West teams might file similar petitions in an attempt to leave
the Lakers out here by themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the movement probably will come later--next summer when
the big '03 free-agent class reaches the market--rather than sooner,
with teams worrying about the luxury tax, but stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   At present, only the top four picks look as if they've been nailed
down. Most of the other teams have way bigger decisions to make than
this one.</TE>
<TE>   What (We Think) We Know</TE>
<TE>   1. Houston--Yao Ming. The Houston Chronicle's Jon Feigen reports
the Rockets have been totally secretive, except for "their trip to
Shanghai, the mayor's trip to Shanghai, their trip to Beijing,
[their] doctor's trip to Beijing where he gave Yao Ming a six-hour
examination, [their] lawyer's second trip to Shanghai, the video (in
Mandarin) about Houston and the Chinese community here [which the
team made for him], or the Rockets' Web site which includes a large
picture of Yao Ming and daily updates of the progress of negotiations
[with the Chinese government.]"</TE>
<TE>   2. Chicago--Jay (ne Jason) Williams. Done deal. He's so
enthusiastic, he even says he likes GM Jerry Krause, a sentiment
rarely heard outside Krause's immediate family.</TE>
<TE>   3. Golden State--Mike Dunleavy Jr. Presumed-outgoing GM Garry St.
Jean is so spooked by past mistakes (you take Vince Carter, we want
Antawn Jamison), he'll make the safe pick. Lots of GMs love this kid
but a few skeptics see only a nice, complementary player.</TE>
<TE>   If St. Jean takes him, bet on the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Miffed at bad reviews, St. Jean holed up, declining even to
release the names of players the Warriors worked out. In last week's
get-it-out-of-the-way news conference, he announced, "We haven't
talked in quite some time and I'll begin this by sharing with you
that it will not be too informative for you. We're not going to talk
about the coaching situation [Brian Winters is still hanging on by
his interim title], specifics about the draft or any trades we might
make."</TE>
<TE>   We're going to miss you, big guy. If you hook on as an assistant
coach again and someone offers a better job, tell them, "I'm better
off here."</TE>
<TE>   4. Memphis--Drew Gooden. Kansas Coach Roy Williams says he's been
told Gooden won't go lower than four. Coincidentally or not, Williams
is close to Jerry West.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the Situation Is a Little Fluid</TE>
<TE>   5. Denver--First, the Nuggets had a Larry Brown strategy. Now they
have a Jason Kidd strategy (fill coaching vacancy with New Jersey
assistant Eddie Jordan, who's friendly with Jason and Antonio
McDyess). However, McDyess, an '03 free agent, has made it clear he
won't stay for what would be his third rebuilding project, and
they're running out of time to turn him around.</TE>
<TE>   6. Cleveland--With the team up for sale, the Cavaliers won't max
out '03 free agent Andre Miller. Coach John Lucas actually
pooh-poohed Miller's numbers, noting he had the ball all the time. Of
course, by the time Andre hits the market, Lucas may have hit the
street. People suspect they may unload everyone and go low in the
hope of getting next spring's No. 1 pick and ... drumroll please ...
LeBron James.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as one coach said, alluding to the fine the Cavaliers paid for
working out James, the prep junior from nearby Akron: "They've
already got $150,000 invested in him."</TE>
<TE>   7. New York--No worries about whom to get rid of. When you've got
nothing, you've got nothing to lose. Good news is a big-time
prospect--Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Chris Wilcox, Nene Hilario or Caron
Butler--will fall to them. Bad news comes in the fall when they,
their fans and press corps learn rookies don't arrive fully
developed.</TE>
<TE>   8. Clippers--Upcoming negotiations with Michael Olowokandi and
Elton Brand make this the biggest summer in their history. They're so
loaded, even players they'd take with their two lottery picks
wouldn't play. They've decided to let Jeff McInnis go and would love
to trade the picks plus whatever it takes for Miller or Baron Davis.
The Hornets said no way. The Cavaliers are still going through their
options.</TE>
<TE>   9. Phoenix--The Suns' Job 1 is getting Penny Hardaway and Tom
Gugliotta's $21 million a year off their salary cap. That should keep
them busy the next two or three years.</TE>
<TE>   10. Miami--Owner Mickey Arison, faced with the reality his no-tax
edict meant melting down what remained of his franchise, told Pat
Riley he could go over the tax threshold, so Riley could stop
shopping Eddie Jones. The Heat won't move '03 free agent Alonzo
Mourning but won't max him out, either, this summer or next, so
Mourning's future there remains in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   11. Washington--The Wizards hope Michael Jordan will return (he
still hasn't said) for one more season. After that, it's back under
their rock.</TE>
<TE>   12. Clippers--Whatever they do with their first pick, they're
likely to move this one.</TE>
<TE>   13. Milwaukee--Unfortunately for the Bucks, nothing's going on.
George Karl and his beloved Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen
and Anthony Mason will be together for one more season. Unless it's
better than the last one, then it'll be ... blooie!</TE>
<TE>   14. Indiana--The Pacers already have everything they need, with
the possible exception of a coach. Anyone who'll take Austin
Croshere's $6.5-million salary off their hands can have this pick.</TE>
<TE>   15. Houston--The Rockets need another forward because Glen Rice
looks like he's now a reserve, at best, and Mo Taylor, who sat out
the season because of an Achilles' injury, weighs 290.</TE>
<TE>   16. Philadelphia--When Brown doesn't move himself, he moves
someone else. Right now, he's looking for a place for Dikembe
Mutombo, who's 36 and makes $17 million a year through age 39.</TE>
<TE>   17. Charlotte/New Orleans--The Hornets better hope Davis, their
new franchise player, loves that French Quarter. He's another '03
free agent and his new agent, Jerome Stanley, reportedly told the
Hornets he won't re-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to Bob [Bass, Hornet GM]," Stanley told the New
Orleans Times-Picayune. " ... but I'm not going to say what we talked
about. At this time Baron ... has nothing to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   18. Orlando--The good news is the Magic has a $10-million slot
next summer. The bad news is, Tim Duncan no longer seems in play and
Coach Doc Rivers wants to know what GM John Gabriel can do for him
this summer. They'd move Mike Miller and/or Darrell Armstrong for one
of the big prospects.</TE>
<TE>   19. Utah--Aside from Karl Malone ('03 free agent) and owner Larry
Miller going back and forth in the local papers, and seven free
agents, most of whom they don't want back, all is peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   20. Toronto--The big decision for the Raptors is re-signing their
6-11 energizer, Keon Clark, which would take them into tax territory,
where they say they don't wish to go.</TE>
<TE>   21. Portland--Trader Bob Whitsitt is at it again, offering
everyone but Rasheed Wallace to move into the top 10 for one of the
big prospects Hilario or 6-9 prep Amare Stoudemire. Other targets of
opportunity: Mourning and Mutombo.</TE>
<TE>   22. Phoenix--And then the Suns have to see if they can introduce
Stephon Marbury to the other guys.</TE>
<TE>   23. Detroit--Everything's cool, as long as they can go on
monumentally overachieving, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   24. New Jersey--Kidd's '03 free agency overhangs everything. This
could be like that of Chris Webber, who found there was no place like
home, however small or industrial-park-laden. The Nets will hold
their breath until Kidd commits himself, which he refuses to do. He
wants a new arena, a new post-up threat (McDyess?) and a new
attitude, or home, for Keith Van Horn.</TE>
<TE>   25. Denver--Oh, and Juwan Howard is an '03 free agent too, and the
Nuggets started George McCloud, Calbert Cheaney and Mengke Bateer at
the end of last season. In other words, another early favorite in the
race for next spring's No. 1 pick.</TE>
<TE>   26. San Antonio--This is David Robinson's swan song, after which
the Spurs will have a big slot to use to replace him (McDyess?)</TE>
<TE>   27. Lakers--What, them worry?</TE>
<TE>   28. Sacramento--The Maloofs are back on Earth after living out
their dream (getting on "The Tonight Show," not the epic battle with
the Lakers.) Now they have to give Mike Bibby $120 million, which
means a big luxury-tax payout and a new austerity program. On the
other hand, with young players such as Bibby, Peja Stojakovic and
Hedo Turkoglu on the rise, they can still get better.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting out the first round--Dallas (although Mark Cuban, who
wants one of the big guys, is working on it); Minnesota (again
shopping Wally Szczerbiak, whose Little Prince act gets old); Seattle
(Gary Payton, '03 free agent, hasn't complained about not getting an
extension ... yet); Boston (trying to get Rodney Rogers to re-up so
the Celtics have something to show for the No. 1 pick they gave the
Suns); and Atlanta (are the Hawks still in this league?)</TE>

<LD>Jonathan Kaye avoided the late trouble that derailed Phil Mickelson,
shooting a five-under-par 65 Saturday to take the third-round lead in
the Greater Hartford Open at Cromwell, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Kaye, suspended for two months and put on probation for the season
after a confrontation with a tournament security guard last year, had
a 13-under 197 to take a one-stroke lead over Scott Verplank into the
final round.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just another round of golf," said Kaye, winless in six full
seasons on the PGA Tour. "I just need to keep doing what I've been
doing."</LD>
<TE>   Verplank, who matched the course record with a 61 in the final
round last year, birdied six consecutive holes on the back nine for a
63.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson played the last three holes in three over for a 66,
leaving the defending champion five strokes back.</TE>

<HD>Ronning Is Traded to Wild</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE and CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when NHL teams attempted to see into the future, otherwise
known as the first day of the league's two-day entry draft, the Kings
exorcised a bit of their most recent past Saturday, trading forward
Cliff Ronning to the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<LD>   Ronning, acquired in a March trade that sent defenseman Jere
Karalahti and a fourth-round draft pick to the Nashville Predators,
was unable to fill the Kings' need for a productive top-six forward.
After contributing one goal and four assists in 14 regular-season
games and no goals and one assist in four playoff games, he was
benched for the Kings' Game 7 loss to the Colorado Avalanche in the
first round.</LD>
<LD>   Unwilling to pick up the $1.85-million option on Ronning's
contract for next season, General Manager Dave Taylor sent the
diminutive winger to the Wild for a fourth-round pick, the No. 104
choice overall, in this year's draft.</LD>
<TE>   "Really, we were looking at a short window with his time in Los
Angeles," Taylor said of Ronning, who was the Predators' leading
scorer. "When we acquired him, we realized that it might be on a
rental basis."</TE>
<TE>   The teams are hoping the players drafted Saturday, by contrast,
stick around longer.</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks, picking seventh, sought size, toughness and
scoring when they selected 6-foot-1, 194-pound center Joffrey Lupul
of Medicine Hat in the Western Hockey League. The Ducks hope that
Lupul, who turns 19 on Sept. 23, will make an impact quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, with the 18th pick, took Russian defenseman Denis
Grebeshkov, who, like all but a handful of the players selected this
weekend, probably won't be ready to make the jump to the NHL for
several years.</TE>
<TE>   In the second round, the Ducks picked center Tim Brent, rated as a
solid two-way player with St. Michael's in the Ontario Hockey League,
and the Kings took Russian left wing Sergei Anshakov.</TE>
<TE>   In the third round, the Ducks drafted Brain Lee, a defenseman from
Erie in the Ontario Hockey League, and the Kings took Petr Kanko, a
right wing from the Czech Republic who plays for Kitchener in the
Ontario Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   The final six rounds of what has been called a thin draft will be
conducted today.</TE>
<TE>   The teams with the first three picks--the Florida Panthers,
Atlanta Thrashers and Columbus Blue Jackets--shuffled the order.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets, their eyes on forward Rick Nash, swapped their
No. 3 pick for the Panthers' No. 1. The Panthers also acquired the
right to swap first-round picks with the Blue Jackets in the 2004
draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers, in an effort to ensure that defenseman Jay
Bouwmeester would be available, gave the Thrashers their third- and
fourth-round picks. So Bouwmeester, long tabbed to be the No. 1 pick,
slipped to third, after the Blue Jackets took Nash and the Thrashers
drafted Kari Lehtonen, a goaltender from Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Lupul led the WHL with 56 goals and was second with 107 points.
The Ducks were so intent on drafting him that they sent one of their
two third-round picks to the Predators, who drafted sixth, to ensure
that Lupul would be available.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought he would go fourth and when he kept going by people we
were pleasantly surprised," General Manager Bryan Murray said. "He's
as close as anybody in the draft to being able to play in the
league."</TE>
<TE>   Lupul is expected to be at training camp in September but probably
will return to Medicine Hat next season.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal right now is definitely to make the Ducks next year," he
said. "Whether that is realistic or not, we'll see at training camp.
I am definitely going to make it hard on the Mighty Ducks to send me
back to juniors."</TE>
<TE>   Grebeshkov has no illusions about playing for the Kings right
away.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do the Kings, though they like his potential. Likening him to
current Kings Mathieu Schneider and Lubomir Visnovsky, Taylor said of
the 6-0, 190-pound Russian: "What we like about him [is], he's got
excellent mobility, good offensive skills and he's the type of
defenseman that could quarterback the power play."</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Murray said he had begun talks to sign center
Stanislav Chistov, the Ducks' No. 1 pick in 2001. The Ducks also
announced the hiring of Chuck Fletcher as director of hockey
operations. Fletcher was the Panthers' assistant general manager.</TE>

<HD>He Wonders If Jordan Has Any Ring Regret</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times on Michael Jordan: "His biggest
mistake was not accepting the $1-million offer from Phil Jackson last
summer and winning another ring.</LD>
<LD>   "That way, he wouldn't have played 40 hard minutes a game during
the first half of the season, which wore him down, and turned his
experience bittersweet....</LD>
<LD>   "And while he would have done some unprecedented standing and
watching while Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant dominated, I suspect
his soul would have been soothed by winning."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most minutes played in an
NBA Finals game without a turnover?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No historian: Florida's Luis Castillo was asked about the
significance of tying Rogers Hornsby's 80-year-old record for the
longest hitting streak (33 games) by a second baseman.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" said Castillo, whose streak ended at 35 games Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Killer instinct: Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe: "Who is the
greatest athlete of our time? Is it Tiger Woods? The master of mental
warfare in a grueling individual sport? Or is it his good friend
Michael Jordan, the wonder boy of team competition, who, in his
prime, was known to slay rivals with alternate use of physical and
psychological daggers?</TE>
<TE>   "I find myself tempted to concede the edge to the regal golfer
over the regal basketball icon. I test my theory with the man who has
developed close friendships with both Woods and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles Barkley, a future NBA Hall of Famer, plays golf with
Tiger twice a month. And remains one of Jordan's confidants.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It is impossible to say which one of them is more competitive,'
Barkley explains. 'The thing that separates them both is they just
don't like winning, they enjoy stomping people.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensively offended: Not everybody is a fan of baseball at Coors
Field in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "The games here are too long--too up and down," Yankee shortstop
Derek Jeter said after a 14-11 loss to the Rockies in a three-game
series that had more than 70 runs. "I'm happy to be out of here. This
has been ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soccer stuff: Ron Rapoport of the Chicago Sun-Times: "Soccer cheap
shot from James Bone of the London Times: 'At last a World Cup that
George Bush can understand....</TE>
<TE>   " '[He] admits that he is as befuddled by the strange sport of
soccer as he seems to be by, say, global warming or the Middle East
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It does not necessarily help that the Washington Post calls
football Osama bin Laden's favorite game.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBA's appeal: Laker Coach Phil Jackson on the attraction of the
game: "The one thing about basketball is that the drama changes every
night.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope they can run like a play on Broadway, but they don't.
There are different lines for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Dan Majerle of Phoenix, 59 minutes against Chicago
on June 13, 1993, three overtimes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: When he broadcast the famous Ice Bowl game in Green
Bay in 1967, Jack Buck turned to his radio partner Frank Gifford and
said: "Excuse me while I have a bite of my coffee."</TE>

<HD>Castillo Rides Streak to All-Star Status</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views ...</LD>
<LD>   News: Luis Castillo passes Rogers Hornsby in setting a record for
longest hitting streak by a second baseman.</LD>
<LD>   Views: Castillo's streak comes too late to impress voters, but it
should get him selected to the National League All-Star team by
Arizona Manager Bob Brenly. Based on first-half performance, it would
be hard to choose between Montreal's Jose Vidro, who began the
weekend with a .327 average, seven homers and 50 runs batted in, and
Florida's Castillo, who was hitting .400 during the streak and .338
overall with two home runs, 17 RBI and 24 stolen bases. However,
Vidro is second and Castillo only seventh in the NL second base
voting. The electorate, clearly voting on reputation and popularity,
has Roberto Alomar, who is batting .267, leading in the latest
tabulations. Might just as well be Hornsby.</LD>
<TE>   News: In-stadium All-Star voting ends, but Internet balloting
continues until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Views: There's no reason to get upset anymore. Baseball likes to
pump it as the Fan's Game, so let the fans choose who they want, even
if voting often seems to have nothing to do with first-half
performance. Alomar aside, the fans aren't doing a bad job as
balloting winds down.</TE>
<TE>   In the American League, it's hard to argue with Jason Giambi at
first base, Alfonso Soriano at second, Shea Hillenbrand at third,
Alex Rodriguez at short and Jorge Posada at catcher. Ichiro Suzuki,
Manny Ramirez and Torii Hunter lead the outfield voting, and the fans
basically have it right there as well except they seem not to have
noticed that Ramirez last played on May 11. Johnny Damon should be
teamed with Suzuki and Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   The voters aren't doing as well in the National League. They have
it right with Todd Helton at first base and Mike Piazza at catcher
(although Paul Lo Duca and Damian Miller might argue), and they have
two-thirds of the outfield correct with Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa,
but Vidro should be the pick over Alomar at second, Mike Lowell over
Scott Rolen at third, Jose Hernandez over Jimmy Rollins at short and,
for the sake of quibbling, Lance Berkman over Vladimir Guerrero in
the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   News: Chan Ho Park starts for the Texas Rangers in Pittsburgh
today.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Park has turned into a $70-million bust, raising the
possibility that he represented a risk away from Dodger Stadium,
where he had a 42-24 career record with a 2.98 earned-run average. In
eight starts with the Rangers, the first two separated by a stint on
the disabled list for a hamstring strain, Park has pitched into the
seventh inning only once and is 2-3 with a 9.40 ERA. He has allowed
44 hits in 37 1/3 innings, walking 19 with 30 strikeouts, and
incurred assorted wounds to a psyche that was fragile down the
stretch last year. Or, as Park told Texas reporters: "Sometimes, I
think too much. If you think too much, you try to do too much, and
that's what has happened to me." Said owner Tom Hicks, insisting Park
is the last of his over-the-top signings and suggesting it's time he
responds: "This is the first time he's been challenged in his career.
I'm sure he doesn't want to disappoint [general manager] John Hart or
me or the fans. He just has to relax and pitch."</TE>
<TE>   News: The San Francisco Giants display some internal rifts.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Well, there was Barry Bonds, tired of serving as target
practice for opposing pitchers without his own pitchers providing
protection in the form of retaliatory dustings, saying, "If our
pitchers ain't going to do it I'll defend myself," (to which none of
the San Francisco pitchers have yet replied either verbally or on the
mound). And there was Manager Dusty Baker, in a poorly disguised shot
at Jeff Kent, who bats behind Bonds, saying he was not surprised at
how often Bonds is being walked intentionally but that he was
surprised "how often" the strategy seems to work. Said Kent: "I'm not
Barry Bonds and I can't compete with Barry Bonds ... [but] I think
we've done all right dealing with the amount of times Barry's been
walked. I [also] think it's pretty chicken ... of clubs across the
league walking him so many times."</TE>
<TE>   News: The San Diego Padres sign Ryan Klesko to a two-year,
$16.5-million extension.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It's hard to say where the Padres' Master Plan is in
relation to having a contending team when they open their new park in
2004, but with $135 million of final financing put in place on May
24, General Manager Kevin Towers was able to finalize a contract with
Klesko that had been basically agreed to in March. He is now working
on a three-year extension with Mark Kotsay. Said Towers: "It didn't
really make a lot of sense to be committing large dollars without any
assurances that there was a definite go-ahead for the new park.
That's kind of what we were waiting on."</TE>
<TE>   News: Mark Grace becomes the 38th player to reach 500 doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Asked if there was a secret to having collected so many,
such as turning singles into doubles, the Arizona first baseman said:
"It's been more a case of turning triples into doubles. I hit them,
and a parachute goes out."</TE>

<LD>Kristen Caverly didn't let distractions from high school graduation
get in the way of another strong performance Saturday at the TYR Swim
Meet of Champions.</LD>
<LD>   Caverly defended her titles in the 200-meter breaststroke and 400
individual medley at the Marguerite Recreation Center in Mission
Viejo, two days after graduating from San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   The celebrations after the ceremony kept Caverly up all night, but
she was determined to maintain her competitive schedule. She won the
breaststroke in 2 minutes 32.73 seconds, slightly more than two
seconds slower than her time at last year's meet.</LD>
<TE>   She came back about 30 minutes later to win the medley in 4:51.10,
just under two seconds slower than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The 400 [individual medley] hurt so bad," said Caverly, who set
the national high school record in the 200-yard individual medley
last year. "I couldn't wait to get to the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Cashion, who will be a junior at Irvine High in the fall,
won a close race in the 50 freestyle. Cashion won in 26.32, edging
Laura Pomeroy of the Toronto All-Stars (26.34) and Lacey Nymeyer of
Arizona Ford (26.35).</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Benko of the Trojan swim club won her second event of the
meet, the 200 freestyle, in 2:01.87.</TE>

<HD>Wimbledon Has a Hole in Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Tradition has taken a nasty hit. No one's fault, really, but the
gents around this club have been put in something of a spot.</LD>
<LD>   What in the world should be done about Centre Court on Monday?</LD>
<LD>   Tradition, beloved tradition, holds that the defending men's
champion at Wimbledon be placed first on Centre Court on opening day,
which used to be practically known as Pete Sampras Day. But the
holder, Goran Ivanisevic, is unavailable for duty because of shoulder
surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Even last year's runner-up, Pat Rafter, would have been suitable.
But he's otherwise engaged, soon to be a father and uncertain about
returning to the game. Naturally, Britain's Tim Henman would be a
wonderful choice--worth a few toasts of sherry from the chaps in the
All England Club--but there's one small problem. He hasn't won here
yet, or even reached the final.</TE>
<TE>   And so, the odds-on favorite is Sampras. The world's No. 1 player,
Lleyton Hewitt, endorsed the idea, pointing out that Sampras is the
most recent winner in the field: "He's probably going to go down as
the greatest player to ever play there."</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, a seven-time champion, a class act, should count
for something. Then again, Sampras' 2002 grass-court record, one win
and losses to Alex Corretja and Nicolas Kiefer, is an obvious minus.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea: leaving Centre Court vacant for an hour Monday.</TE>
<TE>   It would certainly be a metaphor for the men at Wimbledon,
especially in the context about the logical successor to struggling
Sampras. If not Pete, who?</TE>
<TE>   "There are not a whole lot of guys who believe that they can win
Wimbledon. If this isn't a year for the nonbelievers to believe,
there won't ever be," said former player and Turner Sports television
commentator Jim Courier. "We don't have a clear-cut favorite like
we've had for the past decade. Before Sampras, we had [Boris] Becker
and [Stefan] Edberg."</TE>
<TE>   British hope-in-waiting Greg Rusedski believes there are 10 good
grass-court players in the field, counting himself. He does note that
this is the year of the journeyman-turned-Slam-winner: Thomas
Johansson at the Australian Open and Albert Costa at the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to start the year and say those two guys are going to
win the Slams, you would have gotten 100-1, so it's wide open," said
Rusedski, whose best Wimbledon finish was the quarterfinals in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The women's side is much more definitive, starting and ending with
someone named Williams. Sisters Venus and Serena Williams met in the
French Open final earlier this month, with Serena prevailing in
another sloppy, error-riddled affair, and it seems only an injury,
illness or strange occurrence could prevent another all-Williams
final, this time on grass.</TE>
<TE>   Venus, the No. 1 seeded player, is two-time defending champion and
has not lost a match at Wimbledon since going out in the
quarterfinals against Steffi Graf in 1999. Serena's best finish at
Wimbledon was the semifinals in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Venus says she does not have the sense of invincibility at
Wimbledon. Her victories at Wimbledon came shortly after particularly
bad losses at the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes if I go into tournaments overconfident, those are the
ones that I lose," she said. "Tournaments where I go in really not
exactly sure it will be mine, those are the ones I seem to do better
in."</TE>
<TE>   Former champions Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport are missing
the tournament, no surprise because they both skipped Paris,
continuing to recover from surgeries. Jennifer Capriati, a
semifinalist last year, and 2001 finalist Justine Henin of Belgium
have not been able to sustain consistent form against the Williamses.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters made history this month by becoming the first siblings
to be ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like Tiger Woods' kid brother being the No. 2 golfer
in the world," television commentator Mary Carillo said. "It's almost
science fiction that this thing can happen and they're both so young.
As long as they want to dominate they can."</TE>
<TE>   Said Venus: "Obviously, right now it's as great as we've ever
been, being in the finals of a Grand Slam again and No. 1 and No. 2.
It doesn't get much better than this. These are great moments that we
have to enjoy and are going to enjoy whether I want to or not.
Obviously it's not always going to be 1 and 2 the whole time and it's
not always going to be Grand Slam finals every single time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the view from the top on the women's side is exclusive.
Three women have won the last eight Grand Slam titles--Venus Williams
(four), Capriati (three) and Serena Williams (one).</TE>
<TE>   It's the opposite for the men, almost seeming like a bingo game.
Eight men have won the last eight majors--Costa, Johansson, Hewitt
(2001 U.S. Open), Ivanisevic (2001 Wimbledon), Gustavo Kuerten (2001
French Open), Andre Agassi (2001 Australian Open), Marat Safin (2000
U.S. Open) and Sampras (2000 Wimbledon).</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that it hurts the game. When there are no rivalries,
then people begin to lose some interest," Courier said. "There is no
other way to put it. When you have rivalries, you are always keeping
tabs on who is beating whom."</TE>
<TE>   Of those eight Slam winners, Hewitt, Agassi, Johansson and Sampras
have won titles on grass and are playing at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, a three-time winner at Queen's Club, withdrew from a
tune-up event in the Netherlands on Friday because of a stomach
virus, but he practiced at Wimbledon on Saturday and seemed fine.
However, he has never gone past the fourth round at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Roger Federer and Sampras are linked because of their
match last year in the fourth round at Wimbledon, denting the Sampras
aura of invincibility. Federer won in five sets, and since then, the
two have headed in separate directions with Federer winning two
titles this year, in Sydney and Hamburg, and reaching the final at
Milan and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras has switched coaches twice since the grass-court loss to
Federer, and is still searching for his first title since Wimbledon
2000. His best result since the Federer match was reaching the U.S.
Open final in September--losing in straight sets to Hewitt. This
year, he lost in the fourth round at the Australian Open and first at
the French Open. He pulled out of an exhibition Saturday because he
felt a "tweak" in his back.</TE>
<TE>   "He has shaken his tree down to its foundation, and he is
definitely searching. He is looking for that magical answer and
unfortunately that answer does not come instantaneously," said
Courier, who watched Sampras lose to Corretja on grass in the Davis
Cup quarterfinals in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been a pleasant thing for any of us to watch, and for
him it hasn't been a pleasant year. He is looking to Wimbledon to
save his year. He has done this time and time again, but this year it
has never been more pertinent."</TE>

<HD>Angels Make It Through Night</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Washburn is at home in 8-2 victory over the
Brewers, and Kennedy plays despite mourning Kile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>For Jarrod Washburn, there was the pressure of making a dream come
true.</LD>
<LD>   For Adam Kennedy, there was the agony of making a nightmare go
away.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, when the umpire yelled, "Play ball" Saturday night at Miller
Park, both Angels performed as if they didn't have a care in the
world, teaming with Darin Erstad to lead their team to an 8-2 victory
over the Milwaukee Brewers in front of a disappointed crowd of
28,765.</LD>
<TE>   Washburn, a native son who wanted to return a conquering hero, won
his seventh consecutive decision. Erstad, with four hits, and
Kennedy, with three despite mourning the death of friend Darryl Kile,
led a 16-hit Angel attack.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (7-2), who was born in La Crosse, Wis., grew up dreaming
of being a big league star in Milwaukee. He never dreamed it would
happen with the word "Anaheim" lettered across his chest. But when he
saw the 2002 schedule featured an interleague series in Milwaukee, he
counted off the games and was delighted to find his turn in the
rotation would come up this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It was tougher than he could have dreamed. He spent his pregame
time in the clubhouse, normally the time when a pitcher zones in on
the task at hand, crowded around a television with his teammates
learning about the sudden death of Kile, the St. Louis Cardinal
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, Washburn was surrounded by more than 100 family and
friends in the seats.</TE>
<TE>   And once the game started, he was surrounded by Brewer baserunners
every place he looked. Washburn gave up eight hits, stranded eight
runners and threw 122 pitches in six innings. But he was toughest
when he had to be, striking out a career-high 10.</TE>
<TE>   "My dreams came true," Washburn said. "We won."</TE>
<TE>   His manager, Mike Scioscia was most impressed by Washburn's
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "He really worked hard," Scioscia said of the man he calls
"Cheesehead." "I don't think he had his best stuff. They had runners
everywhere. He left it all out there, but that's what he does."</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers had a chance to ruin Washburn's night in the first
inning. They collected three hits, but ran themselves out of a big
inning.</TE>
<TE>   After Eric Young opened with a walk, Ronnie Belliard and Jeffrey
Hammonds had back-to-back singles, scoring one run. But on a pitch
that got Richie Sexson swinging, Belliard was caught going to third.
Angel third baseman Troy Glaus ran Belliard back to second before
applying the tag. Belliard was already in a foul mood after
exchanging angry words with teammate Tyler Houston in the clubhouse
before the game, the cause of their dispute not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ochoa kept the inning going for the Brewers with a single to
right but, when Hammonds tried to score, Tim Salmon fired a strike
that nailed him with several feet to spare.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who had scored a run in the first on Salmon's RBI
single, added two in the second inning, one in the third, fourth and
sixth and two in the seventh. In their well-balanced attack, in which
nine players including Washburn got at least one hit, the Angels
raised their team average to .282.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer hit his ninth home run of the season, and second in
as many nights.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Jose Cabrera (3-5) threw 55 pitches in the first two
innings and left after throwing 90 in four innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who cut Seattle's AL West lead to two games, are doing
so well, they had a potential home run taken away and were able to
shrug it off.</TE>
<TE>   At least, everybody but Bengie Molina was able to shrug it off.
Molina, who is homerless this season in 229 at-bats, hit a towering
fly ball to center in the third inning. Hammonds leaped at the wall
and came down with the ball, enabling the frustrated crowd to finally
let out a cheer.</TE>
<TE>   But replays from several angles clearly showed umpire Bill Hohn
had blown the call. The ball bounced on top of the wall before
Hammonds smothered it with his glove.</TE>
<TE>   "It broke my heart," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, word of Kile's death spread through the
clubhouse. It hit Kennedy as hard as anyone because he got to know
Kile when he was still in the Cardinal organization.</TE>
<TE>   When the crowd was asked for a moment of silence for Kile before
the game, Kennedy told himself, "Let's have this moment for him and
then you've got to play. You've got three hours to stay focused."</TE>

<HD>Gagne Earns Another Save and Some Rest</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He closes fourth game in four days, a 5-4 victory
over Red Sox, but Tracy might sit him today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Eric Gagne vs. the Boston Red Sox was high drama Saturday
afternoon, when the Dodger closer escaped a first-and-third, one-out
jam in the ninth inning to save an emotional 5-4 interleague victory
before 43,833 in Dodger Stadium, a potential Gagne vs. Dodger Manager
Jim Tracy matchup today could be epic.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne's major league-leading 27th save was his fourth in four
days, marking the first time this season the first-year closer has
pitched on four consecutive days, and though his pitch counts were
low--14, 10, 18, 17--Tracy made it clear he would like the dominating
right-hander to rest today.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a pretty good chance he'll get [today] off," Tracy said,
mindful of the danger of over-extending a pitcher who has become an
overnight closing sensation. "He more than likely won't want it.
Sometimes you have to overrule."</LD>
<TE>   But if the Dodgers have a one- or two-run lead in the top of the
ninth and are on the verge of a three-game sweep of one of baseball's
best teams, Gagne, a Montreal native with the blue-collar mentality
of the hockey players he admired as a kid, fully expects to be in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he needed a day off, Gagne said, "Probably not. If we
have a one-run lead ... hopefully we'll score a lot of runs and I'll
have to take the day off ... but I haven't thrown a lot of pitches.
If the game is close, I'll be in there, I'll be good to go."</TE>
<TE>   He'll have to wrestle his manager for the ball, though, and that's
a battle Gagne probably won't win. Tracy, in fact, was hesitant about
using Gagne on Saturday, saying before the game that Gagne was "more
than likely" available. "We'll monitor the situation closely," Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation couldn't have called any more clearly for Gagne on a
day when the Dodgers moved into a first-place tie with Arizona in the
National League West. They erased a 3-0 lead against one of
baseball's hottest pitchers, right-hander Derek Lowe, on Shawn
Green's two-run homer in the fourth, run-scoring singles by Cesar
Izturis and Dave Roberts in the fifth and Marquis Grissom's RBI
fielder's choice in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, who got a solo home run from Rickey Henderson and a
two-run homer from Nomar Garciaparra off Dodger starter Omar Daal in
the fourth, pulled within 5-4 in the eighth. Trot Nixon scored on
Henderson's double-play grounder, which was induced by reliever Paul
Quantrill.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill struck out Johnny Damon to end the eighth inning, and
when Gagne headed through the bullpen gate in left field before the
ninth, Dodger fans rose to their feet to cheer, showing their
appreciation of Gagne's excellence.</TE>
<TE>   But after Garciaparra flied to the wall in left, Shea Hillenbrand
blooped a single to left, and Jason Varitek, who struck out on three
Gagne pitches to end Friday night's game, grounded a single to right,
advancing Hillenbrand to third.</TE>
<TE>   A fine mess you've gotten us into, Mr. Gagne?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly. Gagne is the primary reason the Dodgers are 40-0 when
leading after eight innings and 14-6 in one-run games.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it almost seems he likes it more when there's a guy on
third base and less than two outs," Green said. "He hasn't been
challenged much this year."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who has a 1.14 earned-run average and only one blown save
this season, escaped a first-and-third, one-out jam in San Francisco
on April 9. He saved a June 9 game at Baltimore after allowing the
tying run to reach third with no outs in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy went to the mound to remind Gagne he'd been in his situation
before.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him to just relax and take care of business," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne did, with a little help.</TE>
<TE>   After wiping the sweat away from his goggles, Gagne struck out
Brian Daubach on a full-count changeup.</TE>
<TE>   When he jumped ahead of Carlos Baerga with two strikes, Dodger
fans again rose to their feet, drowning out the large Red Sox fan
contingent with a deafening roar.</TE>
<TE>   Baerga chopped a grounder into the second-base hole, but Alex
Cora, who replaced the ejected Mark Grudzielanek in the fourth inning
and doubled and scored in the fifth, ranged into right field to make
a superb grab, and threw across his body to first to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the crowd today, and hopefully it will be like that every
time I go out there," said Gagne, who punctuated the victory with a
double pump of his right fist. "The adrenaline rush was even higher,
which was good.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't easy, but I got a big strikeout when I needed it, and
Alex Cora made a great play. Sometimes you can't do it by yourself.
You've got to have teammates behind you. Alex Cora saved the game
right there. He should get the save."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid figured it was time for a change.</LD>
<LD>   Make that a lot of changes.</LD>
<LD>   With his team coming off a shutout loss--not only struggling to
score but struggling to stop the other side from scoring--Schmid
shook up his lineup Saturday, benching two key regulars and sending
out five players who didn't start the previous game.</LD>
<TE>   There was no arguing with the result--a 3-0 victory over the
Dallas Burn in front of 14,588 Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy went from the wrong side of a shutout to the right side
after its 5-0 loss last week to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   There will be more changes soon, when Cobi Jones returns to the
lineup after his stint with the U.S. World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Jones made it to the Rose Bowl on Saturday after landing in Los
Angeles at 10 a.m. Unlike U.S. teammate Landon Donovan--who entered
the San Jose Earthquake game as a substitute Saturday--he didn't
attempt to play.</TE>
<TE>   "He's young. He's 20. He can do that," laughed Jones, still
conferring with team officials about whether to return for the next
game or wait until July 4. "The last thing I want is burnout."</TE>
<TE>   For the Galaxy, Saturday was a welcome change after playing six of
the last seven on the road and winning only one of the last five.</TE>
<TE>   On a team that had gotten precious little goal-scoring from anyone
but Carlos Ruiz, Sasha Victorine broke through for the first goal of
the match when he headed in Alejandro Moreno's cross in the 58th
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Victorine's goal was the first by a starting Galaxy midfielder
this season, and the assist was the first of the season for Moreno,
one of the new players in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy made it 2-0 when defender Alexi Lalas scored in the
69th minute after Gavin Glinton's cross for Ruiz came to him instead.
Lalas knocked the ball down and put it in the far corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Mullan, who entered the game in the 72nd minute, scored the
final goal nine minutes later after Glinton drew goalkeeper Matt
Jordan out of position to make a save and Mullan scored into an open
net.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first three-goal game of the season by the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "You know I think everybody's been frustrated with the last game
and the last results in some of the road games," Victorine said. "It
was good to put a little pressure on the players."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid shifted from a 4-4-2 formation to a 4-3-3, and in the
process took two regulars out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Danny Califf was benched for the first time this season a
week after he had the primary responsibility for marking the
MetroStars' Mamadou Diallo, who scored four goals.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid also benched midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, a player who
has been with the team since its inception but has only two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman had to make only four saves for the
shutout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games, Donovan entered in the 85th minute despite a
12-hour journey from South Korea to Los Angeles, then an hour-long
flight to San Jose. He didn't score, but San Jose still beat
Colorado, 4-0, before 10,431.... Igor Simutenkov scored twice and
Kansas City beat New England, 3-2, before 8,288 at Kansas City,
Mo.... Rodrigo Faria scored in the 81st minute before 12,721 at
Naperville, Ill., to lift New York/New Jersey to a 1-0 victory over
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In WUSA games, Venus James, who hadn't scored in 20 WUSA games in
her career, had two goals in her first start of the season before
5,761 fans at Washington, and Carolina beat Washington, 3-1....
Charmaine Hooper and Cindy Parlow scored first-half goals before
6,670, and host Atlanta beat San Jose, 2-1.... Dagny Mellgren and
Maren Meinert scored two goals to lead Boston to a 5-2 victory over
New York before 6,548.</TE>

<KH>BOYS' TENNIS PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>From Start to the Finish, It Was Stewart's Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Stewart is intrigued by mathematics and science and takes the
same clinical approach to excelling at tennis as he does to studying
those subjects.</LD>
<LD>   Hence, the recent incorporation of yoga into his weekly regimen of
physical fitness and mental discipline.</LD>
<LD>   "I've heard from a lot of people that it would really help me with
my tennis," Stewart said, "and I figured it can't hurt."</LD>
<TE>   He hopes yoga class, which he alternates each day with
weightlifting, will increase his flexibility and balance. But the
strength, speed and stamina that Stewart already possesses and the
power and pace of his shots make the Malibu High senior a formidable
player.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was the hottest player on the high school scene all year.</TE>
<TE>   He won the singles and doubles titles at the Easter Bowl/U.S.
Tennis Assn. Super National Spring Championships in April. He won the
CIF Boys' Interscholastic singles title at the 102nd Ojai Valley
tournament two weeks later and rolled through the high school season
undefeated until he lost in three sets to Chris Surapol of Cerritos
Whitney in the Southern Section individual tournament championship
match.</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of his stellar season, Stewart has been selected
The Times' boys' tennis player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great feeling [to win]," Stewart said. "When you're
playing that well, you just go with it and see how long you can make
it last."</TE>
<TE>   The 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1 loss to Surapol was the only blemish on
Stewart's 63-1 record and one of the few times he struggled during a
season in which he dominated almost everyone. Stewart went unbeaten
and won the Southern Section title as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   "What Doug accomplished was just amazing," Malibu Coach John
McCampbell said. "I hadn't seen him lose in almost three years."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who had a match point in the second set against Surapol,
was trying to become the first player to win consecutive section
singles titles since Redlands' Richard Bohrnstedt in 1967 and '68.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no excuse [for the loss]," Stewart said. "He just played
too well."</TE>
<TE>   That's what opposing players usually said about Stewart, who will
attend Virginia on a tennis scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is to have an answer for whatever your opponent is
doing," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   He almost always did.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really the consummate professional athlete at a very young
age," McCampbell said. "His conditioning, diet, he takes it very
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "And he handles himself the same way. He could be losing 3-1 or
winning 5-0, and I really couldn't tell."</TE>
<TE>   Except that usually, he was winning.</TE>

<LD>Before his final ride today aboard Came Home in the Affirmed
Handicap, jockey Chris McCarron has a chance to pad his win total.</LD>
<LD>   The world's sixth-winningest rider, McCarron will ride races two
through seven at Hollywood Park and all of his mounts are contenders.</LD>
<LD>   In the second, a $51,000 optional claimer for older fillies and
mares at 1 1/16 miles, McCarron will be on Trackofthecat, who is the
co-third choice at 4-1 on Russ Hudak's morning line.</LD>
<TE>   McCarron will ride Miss Hennessy in the third, a six-furlong race
for $62,500 maiden fillies and mares. The Hennessy filly hasn't been
out since Aug. 12, but has trained well for Mike Machowsky. In the
fourth, a $51,000 optional claimer at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf,
Always Game is McCarron's mount. The veteran gray has won six of 16,
with his last victory coming on April 27 on the Hollywood Park grass
with McCarron aboard.Blind Ambition, a debuting Political Ambition
filly, is McCarron's mount in the fifth, a 6 1/2-furlong maiden race
for fillies and mares.</TE>
<TE>   Come Back Ronnie, who won for McCarron on April 26, is a contender
in a wide-open sixth, a one mile turf affair for $62,500 claimers.</TE>
<TE>   It concludes with Came Home, the 6-5 favorite on the morning line
who will almost certainly be a shorter price in the Affirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Besides Always Game, the fifth brings out win
machine Fit For A King and Endless Summer, who was a top 2-year-old
in England in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: McCarron. For parts of four decades, he has been at the
top of his profession and is arguably the best position rider and one
of the best on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's first at Hollywood Park. The eight
$8,000 claimers are three of 47 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using all in the sixth, singling
Came Home in the seventh, Virginia Miss and Atlantic Ocean in the
eighth and singling Yolanda's Pride in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/118. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17/$687.40. Total money bet: $756.</TE>

<HD>Kile's Death Stuns Baseball</HD>
<DH>Cardinals: St. Louis pitcher, 33, is found in his Chicago
hotel room and appears to have died of natural causes. Game against
Cubs is canceled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darryl Kile, one of the St. Louis Cardinals' top pitchers and one of
the best in baseball, was found dead in his Chicago hotel room
Saturday. Police said there were no signs of criminal involvement and
that Kile, 33, appeared to have died of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears he died in his bed, in his sleep," said Michael
Chasen, commanding officer of Chicago's Area Three Homicide unit,
adding that medical examiners will conduct an autopsy today.</LD>
<LD>   The shocking development prompted cancellation of Saturday's game
between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, where Joe
Girardi, the Cubs' catcher and player representative, addressed the
crowd of about 40,000--unaware at that point of Kile's death--from
behind a microphone at home plate and said the game would not be
played because of a "tragedy in the Cardinals family" and asked fans
to say a prayer for the Cardinal organization and its players.</LD>
<TE>   "Our club is just totally staggered, I mean, devastated," St.
Louis Manager Tony La Russa told reporters, wiping away tears. "You
guys know what a pro [Darryl] is."</TE>
<TE>   A product of Norco High and Chaffey College who was only a
30th-round draft choice of the Houston Astros in 1987, Kile blossomed
into a top-of-the-rotation starter with a devastating curveball. He
had a 133-119 record in 12 seasons with the Astros, Colorado Rockies
and Cardinals, pitching a no-hitter against the New York Mets in 1993
and winning 20 games for the Cardinals in 2000 before going 16-11
last year.</TE>
<TE>   He had pitched the Cardinals into first place in the National
League Central with a victory over the Angels on Tuesday night, won
three of his last four starts in improving to 5-4 with a 3.72
earned-run average in 14 games and was scheduled to pitch tonight
against the Cubs. That game is still scheduled to be played.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this is a very tragic event for the Cardinals,
Darryl's family and all of baseball," St. Louis General Manager Walt
Jocketty said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great competitor and leader on the club who I had grown
close to in the last two years because he was the type leader that I
could go to and ask questions about other players and situations in
the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that stood out most about him was his competitiveness.
He loved to compete and he loved to win, and he was very instrumental
in the development of [Cardinal ace] Matt Morris and very close to
our young pitchers. It's going to be very tough to play for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Kile's death followed by only a few days the loss of longtime St.
Louis broadcaster Jack Buck, and Jocketty said "it will obviously be
a difficult mourning period for the team and city, but we'll have to
find a way to battle through it, go on, and win the division. I'm
sure that's what Darryl would want."</TE>
<TE>   Jocketty said the Cardinals became concerned Saturday when Kile,
usually one of the first players to report, was not on the team bus
to Wrigley Field and had not arrived at the required time. Calls to
his room at the team hotel went unanswered, and hotel security
ultimately had to use force to enter the room, where Kile was found
in his bed.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Loomis, the Cardinals' assistant team physician, said the
6-foot-5, 215-pound Kile had no health problems and was not on
medication. He said Kile had undergone shoulder surgery in the
off-season but "other than muscular and skeletal" conditions at
different times in his career there was no evidence of a serious
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's father, David, died at 44 of a reported heart attack and
stroke in 1993, but Loomis and Cardinal officials refused to
speculate on the cause of Kile's death.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's wife, Flynn, was "obviously distraught" when notified in
San Diego, Cardinal officials said. She is left with 5-year-old
twins, a boy and girl, and a son born last August.</TE>
<TE>   The development stunned baseball.</TE>
<TE>   At Dodger Stadium, Boston Red Sox pitcher John Burkett expressed
the view of many when he said, "An auto accident you can understand,
but dying in your sleep? That's a strange deal."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown called Kile's death "a real wake-up
call. We live and breathe baseball this time of year, but something
like this jolts you to reality."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Jesse Orosco, a teammate of Kile's in St. Louis two
years ago, described him as "a great guy, great family man, an
unbelievable teammate" who was always talking baseball and you could
"always hear yelling and screaming."</TE>
<TE>   At Miller Stadium in Milwaukee, Angel outfielder Tim Salmon said,
"We all think we are invulnerable. When I travel, I think about my
wife and kids back home. But you never think anything could happen to
you."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee pitcher Mike DeJean, a teammate of Kile's in Colorado,
said, "When a guy like Darryl, who had everything going for him, is
blindsided, it turns your life upside down."</TE>
<TE>   Jamey Wright, another Milwaukee pitcher was a teammate of Kile's
in Colorado, had tears in his eyes as he sat at his locker stall and
talked about the man he regarded not only as a friend, but as a
mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "He always told me," said Wright, speaking softly, "that no matter
what's going on, whether you just threw a shutout or whether you got
your teeth kicked in, you walk off that mound with your head held
high.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the ultimate father, son, husband, teammate and friend. As
sad as I am, as hard as it is for me to fight back these tears, I
can't imagine what his team is going through.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to have a tough time playing not just today, but for
the rest of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement: "My deepest sympathies
go out to Darryl's family, his friends and the St. Louis ballclub.
All of baseball mourns his passing."</TE>

<HD>They Never Forgot Kile at Chaffey College</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Pitcher became a 'prized trophy' after Division I
schools thought him too thin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wes Brickey's most treasured baseball memento is a game ball from a
Houston Astros' 6-4 regular-season victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies.</LD>
<LD>   It was the ball Darryl Kile pitched while claiming his first major
league victory on June 23, 1991.</LD>
<LD>   Kile gave the ball to former Chaffey College baseball coach Howard
Lowder, the man credited with teaching Kile the curveball that he
developed into the signature pitch of his repertoire.</LD>
<TE>   Before Lowder died in 1992, he passed along the ball to Brickey,
Chaffey's former director of maintenance who supervised all athletic
fields at the school and once built a pitching mound for Kile under
the football stadium's stands to allow for practice when it was
raining.</TE>
<TE>   Brickey, now retired and 73, spent Saturday mourning the death of
Kile, 33.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of time together when he was here," Brickey said.
"I can't believe he's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Chaffey College, in Rancho Cucamonga, was a pivotal stop for Kile.
He was born in Garden Grove and attended Norco High, where he was a
first baseman/pitcher who was deemed too thin to gain a Division I
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "He really just wanted to go to Riverside Community College, but
they wouldn't take him," Brickey said. "They thought he was too
skinny too."</TE>
<TE>   Lowder thought differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying Howard knew that Darryl would turn into the
pitcher he became, but I clearly remember him telling me one day when
Darryl and another kid from the Riverside area came to the campus
that I had to see this kid [Kile]," veteran Chaffey Athletic Director
Bob Olivera said.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard said, 'I think I can turn him into a pitcher.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Astros, acting on a tip from a regional scout named Ross Sape,
selected Kile in the 30th round of the 1987 draft.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we could keep his rights for another year because of the
draft-and-follow rules, so Ross went to work with Darryl on nutrition
and strength programs after we picked him," said Doug Deutsch, an
Astros' Southern California scout.</TE>
<TE>   Olivera said he remembers a startling summer body transformation
in Kile. "It was like he became Lou Ferrigno turning into the
Incredible Hulk," Olivera said. "He started growing like a weed. He
just took off, like 30-to-40 pounds and two or three inches."</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch said Kile's fastball speed reflected the changes, rising
from 83 mph to 92 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff was there when we drafted him--he had a blessed
arm--but Ross and [then-Astro West Coast scouting supervisor] Reggie
Waller knew how to get it there," Deutsch said. "He became a prized
trophy."</TE>
<TE>   Kile dominated at Chaffey as a sophomore, striking out 125 in 110
innings and finishing 10-2.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was ready to add him to its staff. And other major
league scouts judged Kile to be a top-15 pick in the first round. The
Astros chose to sign him, delivering a stunning $100,000 bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way we could let him get away," Deutsch said.</TE>
<TE>   Kile moved up the Astros' chain, pitching a no-hitter and making
the All-Star team in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an ace, at Houston, at Colorado, at St. Louis," Olivera
said. "I am just absolutely crushed by this. Darryl was a good human,
a caring individual who you wanted good things to happen to.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to know what happened. I'm devastated by this."</TE>

<LD>A night after the stakes-filled California Champions quarterhorse
program, thoroughbreds will be featured in three of the nine races.</LD>
<LD>   In the first, older fillies and mares racing for a $2,500 tag will
run 4 1/2 furlongs, the only distance thoroughbreds run at Los
Alamitos. Vagabondia, who broke her maiden two back for trainer Jesus
Nunez, looks like the one to catch.</LD>
<LD>   Two races later, Riggin Lady, who has won seven of 32, will try to
go wire to wire against five other $2,500 fillies and mares. Owned
and trained by Adan Farias, the 5-year-old has the advantage of the
rail and will be handled by Victor Diaz. In the sixth, 10 older males
running for the $2,500 tag will get together and Proyen, who won at
31-1 June 9, will try to win another on the front end as he leaves
from the inside post. Modesto Linares will ride for trainer Juan
Cervantes.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Vagabondia. 2. Heza Quick Dash. 3. Riggin Lady. 4.
EG Belle Star. 5. Favoritt. 6. Proyen. 7. Apollo Dash. 8. Hallelujah
Train. 9. Oh Beda.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Vagabondia, Star Savona and Lyla's Hart in the first,
single Heza Quick Dash in the second, use Riggin Lady and Flores Wild
Cat in the third and Party Train, EG Belle Star and Brisco County
Bell in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: El Gran Caesar adds Lasix in the sixth for
Nunez. Cowboytakemeaway is a first-time starter for trainer John
Cooper in the seventh and Alex Bautista takes the call.</TE>

<LD>Making his first start as a 6-year-old, A Ransom did what he was
supposed to on California Champions Night Saturday at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   The 1-2 favorite and defending champion in the $159,250 Spencer L.
Childers Handicap, the world champion quarter horse of 2000 broke
well and proved clearly best over 11-1 shot Whosleavingwho and four
others. The final time for the 400 yards in the Grade I was 19.66
seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by John and Kathie Bobenrieth and trained by Connie Hall, A
Ransom, a gelded son of First Down Dash, won for the 18th time in 29
starts and pushed his career earnings past $900,000.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third stakes win of the night for jockey Carlos
Bautista and the second for Hall. They had teamed to win the $28,150
California Breeders Sophomore Stakes two races earlier with longshot
Debuts Dasher. Bautista's other victory had come with Classic Sassy
Chic in the $27,450 California Breeders' Freshman Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   In the first of the two other Grade I races on the program, Flys R
Streakin, the 5-2 second choice, blew away his eight foes in the
$349,000 Governor's Cup Futurity. He won for the third time in four
starts for trainer Jaime Gomez and owner Dutch Masters III,
completing the 350 yards in 17.54 seconds under jockey Joe Badilla,
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Badilla returned a race later to win the other Grade I, the
$136,000 Governor's Cup Derby with favored Last Shall Be First for
owner Spencer L. Childers and trainer Dan Francisco.</TE>

<HD>On Deck, Castillo Has Streak End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>With a blank stare on his face, Luis Castillo stood in the on-deck
circle and watched his teammates celebrate a fifth consecutive
victory Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo was obviously disappointed with the end of his 35-game
hitting streak, the 10th-longest in baseball history. But it was the
winning streak that mattered most to the Florida Marlins--and
Castillo eventually agreed.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo went 0 for 4 and was left on deck when the Marlins
finished off a four-run rally in the ninth inning to defeat the
Detroit Tigers, 5-4.</LD>
<TE>   "I tried everything I could and I didn't do it," Castillo said. "A
lot of people wanted me to have one more chance."</TE>
<TE>   After Tim Raines' one-out, game-ending sacrifice fly, Castillo
slowly pulled off his batting helmet as his teammates swarmed Raines
and Andy Fox, who scored the winning run. Manager Jeff Torborg went
straight to Castillo, put his arms around the switch-hitting
Dominican and whispered into his ear.</TE>
<TE>   "That's between him and me," Torborg said. "He's just a great kid
that accomplished something special."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo's streak was the longest since Paul Molitor hit safely in
39 in a row in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Raines could have guaranteed Castillo a fifth plate appearance by
not swinging the bat. He even asked Torborg what he should do and the
manager told him to win the game.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo flied out in the first inning, struck out swinging in the
third, grounded into a fielder's choice in the fifth and grounded out
in the eighth. His first three at-bats were against left-hander Mark
Redman. His last was against right-hander Jose Paniagua.</TE>
<TE>   Hustling down the first-base line, Castillo made his final out a
close play. He received a standing ovation before each at-bat, then a
much longer one after his eighth-inning out.</TE>
<TE>   Chants of "Louie, Louie" spread across the stadium, and he popped
out of the dugout for a curtain call. He pumped his right hand high
above his head as the cheering continued.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to keep going....I don't feel very good right now,"
Castillo said. "I tried to do what I could for the fans. It's over."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo's streak is the longest by a Latin player and the longest
by a second baseman.</TE>
<TE>   It tied Ty Cobb (1917) and Fred Clarke (1895) for the 10th longest
of all-time. George Sisler also had a 35-game hitting streak, but it
spanned two seasons (1924-25).</TE>
<TE>   Only nine players have had a longer streak, including only two
since 1950--Pete Rose (44) in 1978 and Molitor. Joe DiMaggio set the
record of 56 games in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-1, with one out in the ninth, Charles Johnson hit a
two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-runner Homer Bush scored on an error to tie the score. With
Fox on second, the Marlins sent Raines to pinch-hit.</TE>
<TE>   Fox moved to third on Juan Acevedo's wild pitch. Raines then
lifted a 2-and-2 pitch into center field. Fox tagged and easily beat
Wendell Magee's throw.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was initially disheartened, but later agreed that winning
was more important than extending the streak.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has to be like that, I feel fine," he said. "If it's over,
it's over."</TE>

<HD>In the Long Battle for Respect, It's Still U.S. Against the
World</HD>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>One by one, 32 nations and cultures head to the World Cup departure
gate asking themselves the same question.</LD>
<LD>   What next?</LD>
<LD>   In England, it is what's next for David Seaman, the veteran
goalkeeper whose international career may have ended with the soft,
high Brazilian cross he let sail over his head into his net?</LD>
<TE>   In France, it is what's next for Roger Lemerre, the coach who
inherited the world champions from Aime Jacquet and oversaw it right
out the tournament in three games with no wins and no goals?</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, it is what's next for Rafael Marquez, the 23-year-old
defender who impressed clubs across Europe with his poised play and
may soon have several of them lined up for his services?</TE>
<TE>   Only in America does the question carry the hint of doubt and
skepticism--not about the U.S. team, a World Cup quarterfinalist
suddenly coming to grips with its young potential, but about the very
sport at which it is learning to excel.</TE>
<TE>   What next for soccer in the United States?</TE>
<TE>   As in: Is this the event that finally enables soccer to "make it"
in the United States?</TE>
<TE>   (Whatever that means. The not-so-subliminal suggestion every time
that question is posed: This is basketball country, boot boys. When
you come back home, remember to know your place.)</TE>
<TE>   We have been outsiders in Asia, truly one of a kind. At this World
Cup in Japan and South Korea, there have been 31 countries with an
unrelenting, unbridled passion for what the rest of the world calls
football--and there has been us, the Clueless Yanks, who don't
appreciate saw-ker, who don't understand it or even know what to call
it, who clearly don't deserve a team capable of beating Portugal and
sending a 90-minute jolt of fear through Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The United States had just finished perhaps the best World Cup
match it has ever played, pushing Germany to the limit in an eventual
1-0 American defeat, and a foreign journalist hit U.S. Coach Bruce
Arena with this:</TE>
<TE>   "Have you considered that when all this razzamatazz is over with
that America goes back to following its three or four major sports?"</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Rudi Voeller never gets those kind of questions.</TE>
<TE>   Arena just rolled his eyes, took a deep breath and advised, "Well,
let's wait and see what happens. Let's talk in 2006 and see if this
World Cup has had any impact on soccer in our country."</TE>
<TE>   Arena was simply being diplomatic. The foreign journalist can be
excused for painting with a broad brush, because he's not familiar
with the turf. But U.S. writers taking their potshots in their
quickie soccer-will-never- make-it-with-Americans takes need to take
a longer look at what constitutes being "American" in June of the
year 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Because when they do, they will see that soccer has already "made
it" in the melting pot of Mexican-Americans, Euro-Americans,
Asian-Americans and all the other ethnic Americans whose interest in
the sport cannot be measured in Major League Soccer television
ratings and Women's United Soccer Assn. attendance figures.</TE>
<TE>   Americans I know avidly follow their favorite club and national
teams on Univision and Telemundo and Fox Sports World and the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Americans I know wake-up at 6 on Saturday morning to head to the
local soccer pub to watch live European matches kicking off at 7 a.m.
or shell out for satellite English Premier League game of the week
telecasts, or link on to the Web for live radio commentary from
Manchester or London.</TE>
<TE>   Americans I know, some of them 35-year-old soccer moms, some of
them 50-year-old business owners, some of them 40-year-old
sportswriters, suit up every weekend to play in adult soccer leagues
across the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   These Americans buy athletic shoes and televisions and cars, which
is why Nike and Philips and Chevrolet have signed to sponsor U.S.
soccer during this World Cup. The success of the U.S. team only gives
these companies and others incentive to strengthen and expand those
corporate ties.</TE>
<TE>   These Americans are the reasons Philip Anschutz continues to build
$50-million soccer-specific stadiums across the country, trying to
tap into that huge wellspring of soccer interest many in the
mainstream media have conveniently and lazily chosen to ignore.
Anschutz rarely invests $50 million in losing propositions.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Rothenberg, the former president of U.S. Soccer who organized
the successful American World Cup of 1994, is smart enough to know
there is no "big-bang" event that is going to catapult soccer into
the football-basketball-baseball universe.</TE>
<TE>   But soccer has carved its niche, and that niche grows a larger
with every U.S. success on the playing field--the women winning the
1996 Olympics and 1999 World Cup, the men reaching the 2000 Olympic
semifinals and 2002 World Cup quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no magic wand," Rothenberg says, "You just keep working
hard ... We need to keep re-investing in player development, building
the right stadiums and getting the TV money to help move us further
along."</TE>
<TE>   It's a classic American conceit: If soccer stadiums around the
world sell out and soccer media around the world treat the sport as
religion, soccer must be doomed for failure in America because those
things aren't happening in California, Texas and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the world had a century's head start when it comes to
growing a soccer culture. Playing catch-up takes some time.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought we'd see us reach the stage where we'd see the
U.S. in the quarterfinals against Germany and have Germany on the
run," Rothenberg says. "The last 30 minutes they were just whacking
the ball out of there, trying to take the heat off."</TE>
<TE>   Give Americans a good team, with at least a chance to win, and
they will follow it anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The fans who followed Team USA to South Korea also stepped up
their game. Round by round, their chanting not only grew louder but
more creative as well.</TE>
<TE>   "L-A RE-JECT!" they chanted when Mexico brought on substitute Luis
Hernandez, a bust with the Galaxy, during the second-round match in
Jeonju.</TE>
<TE>   "A-DI-OS AM-I-GOS!" they sang, serenading Hernandez and his
teammates off the field and out of the tournament as time wound down
on the United States' 2-0 triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most important victories in the history of U.S. soccer
occurred between midnight and 6:30 in the morning. Quite literally,
they happened overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Developing a soccer culture worthy of a World Cup quarterfinalist
takes a little longer.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Swimming world-record holder Aaron Peirsol of Newport Harbor High and
three-sport standout Julie Pitts of North Torrance have been chosen
the boys' and girls' athletes of the year in the state by CalHi
Sports.</LD>
<LD>   Peirsol, who swam in the 2000 Olympic Games, set a short-course
world record in the 200 backstroke this spring, helped set a world
record in the 400-meter medley relay and led Newport Harbor to the
Southern Section Division I title with two individual titles and two
relay victories.</LD>
<LD>   Pitts was all-league in volleyball, all-section in basketball when
she averaged 21 points and 12 rebounds a game and placed among the
top five finishers in three events at the state track meet--second in
the 300 hurdles, third in the high jump and fifth in the 400.</LD>

<HD>Bloomington's Football Job Is Given to Roper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stewart Roper was approved as Bloomington's new football coach
Thursday at a board meeting of the Colton Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   Roper, who was the coach at Blythe Palo Verde High, replaces
Robert Kistner, who resigned in April to spend more time with his
family. The Bruins were 0-9 last year.</LD>
<LD>   Some believed the job would go to Don Markham, who was fired as
Rialto's coach in May because he told school officials he could not
commit to staying through the upcoming season.</LD>
<TE>   Markham, with a 274-78-1 record in 30 years, won four of his five
Southern Section titles with Colton in 1978 and with Bloomington in
1994, '96 and '97.</TE>
<TE>   Markham, 62, has been known to move frequently from school to
school and publicly criticized some of his Rialto players last
season, calling them "a bunch of jerks" in an interview with The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   In other personnel moves:</TE>
<TE>   * Krissy Duperron has resigned as girls' varsity basketball coach
at North Torrance to take a job as a varsity assistant at
Westchester. Duperron guided the Saxons to a 24-7 record and the
Southern Section Division II-A championship game in her only season.</TE>
<TE>   * Matt Dann, a varsity assistant football coach last season at
Fillmore High, has been promoted to head coach.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Title IX in 2002, as it's being interpreted, as it's being used, is
an anachronism.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years ago, Title IX was a great and necessary legal
solution to a genuine problem. Women weren't being offered fair
chances to participate in sports in our high schools and
universities.</LD>
<LD>   The law has worked. Better than women athletes could have hoped.
Not only are there thousands of scholarships for basketball,
softball, volleyball and tennis players, there are free rides offered
to women in sports such as rowing and equestrian.</LD>
<TE>   Title IX, as it is currently being implemented, is too often used
as a mathematical cudgel, a blind and blunt instrument that ignores
common sense and beats out a one-note tune ... proportionality.</TE>
<TE>   If 200 men play sports, 200 women must play sports. And that's if
the school has 50 percent male and 50 percent female students.</TE>
<TE>   More and more that's not the case. If 300 men want to play sports
and 250 women want to play sports, 50 men can't play sports in that
same scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Title IX, as it is being implemented, is making women's college
sports into a welfare state. The assumption is that women's sports
can't stand on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Title IX in 2002 assumes that women are too weak to fight for
themselves, too weak-minded to continue creating opportunities for
themselves, too gutless to demand with their numbers and voices and
financial power to push forward what was started by Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   While the numbers of women in professional schools, such as
medicine and law, have risen dramatically without the kind of strict
interpretation of Title IX upon which sports has relied, Title IX
backers seem to think women in sports would give up meekly without
that interpretation or without the law.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   If Title IX went away tomorrow, why would athletic directors and
their bosses, university presidents, start slashing women's sports
programs? They wouldn't dare. Fathers are as involved in their
daughters' athletic opportunities as in their sons'.</TE>
<TE>   Maryalyce Jeremiah, assistant athletic director at Cal State
Fullerton, said Bobby Knight once told her, "The best friend of women
in sports are men with daughters." He's right.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Guerrero, the new UCLA athletic director, has two
sports-loving daughters. One is a scholarship volleyball player. If
Title IX went away tomorrow, Guerrero would never consider dumping
women's sports or cutting their budgets or marginalizing female
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   If Title IX went away tomorrow, would women quit wanting to play
sports, would this whole generation of young women who consider it
"olden times" if someone talks about how it used to be that girls
didn't get to play team sports, sit quietly if schools cut back on
athletic scholarships or made the women's teams travel by
coach-driven vans while the men flew?</TE>
<TE>   That's an insult to the women.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the year Title IX was voted into law, I was a high school
senior. In my last semester, Waukegan High in Illinois began offering
team sports for girls. My picture was in the local paper, proudly
teeing off, as a member of the first girls' golf team. I remember
wishing more than anything that I was a freshman and not a senior on
that day we played our first varsity match.</TE>
<TE>   But Title IX had nothing to do with that team. Progress had begun,
senses had been arrived at already, without the help of law or
bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gobrecht, the well-grounded, sensible, talented coach of
USC's women's basketball team, says she's afraid that if Title IX
were rescinded, "it would be a scary thing. You would be at the whim
of the policy-making people at each institution and all this progress
could be stifled.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived a life of quiet desperation for so long, wanting to play
baseball and basketball when I was a young girl," Gobrecht says. "I
very much wanted to be an athlete and in the society I grew up
within, that was not allowed. My biggest argument about Title IX is
that I don't think any race, religion, any sexual orientation in our
world has experienced the depth and consistency of discrimination
women have suffered relative to men."</TE>
<TE>   That is a strong feeling and a sad one.</TE>
<TE>   And it is a feeling male athletes are beginning to share. While
Title IX supporters say that it is not Title IX at fault but
short-sighted administrators who cower in the face of big football,
unwilling, for example, to cut the numbers of scholarship gridiron
players or unwilling to reduce the big football coaching staffs or
travel squads, Marquette University cuts its men's wrestling program.
Marquette doesn't have football.</TE>
<TE>   Men, numbers tell us, are more willing and eager to be walk-on
athletes, to participate on a team as nothing more than a benchwarmer
or tackling dummy or practice fodder. Women, numbers tell us, want to
be significant and contributing members of a team or they will do
something else.</TE>
<TE>   According to NCAA numbers, it takes 18 scholarships to produce a
21-woman track and field team but only 12.6 scholarships to field a
32-man track and field team. There are 600 more women's NCAA teams
than men's yet there are 50,000 more male NCAA athletes.</TE>
<TE>   So now schools tell men they can't walk on. Can't ruin the
numbers. And coaches of teams like women's crew desperately seek out
tall, athletic-appearing women at freshman orientation and beg them
to come out for the sport. A scholarship is waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The men are starting to fight back. An intercollegiate wrestling
organization has filed suit claiming that Title IX ramifications are
discriminatory to the nonrevenue men's sports.</TE>
<TE>   If the only way to treat one group fairly is to treat another
unfairly, what has been accomplished?</TE>
<TE>   Is it not possible that maybe women will never want to participate
in sports in the same way or in the same numbers as men? What is
being improved for women or men when men are told there is no place
for them and their sport on a college campus?</TE>
<TE>   What would be the reaction if there were a Title IX for, say,
professional basketball? What sense would it make to say that the
Lakers could sell no more tickets than the Sparks sell because it's
just not right that the Lakers have 20,000 people cheering for them
while the Sparks have only 8,000? Would that make fans more eager to
buy Sparks' tickets or angry that the Sparks exist at all?</TE>
<TE>   The world is not always perfectly proportionate. It was long
overdue that women got to play team sports and learn the lessons of
competition, leadership and sportsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   But women have arrived in that place. More arrive every day. Force
isn't necessary and a law that was once helpful is now more often
hurtful.</TE>

<HD>Senegal's 1-0 Loss Is a Real Turkey</HD>
<DH>Quarterfinal: Popular African team is shut down by a squad
few thought could make the semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The World Cup has a name for a team that won't take a hint, hasn't
gone away, didn't allow Japan's nationwide party to last past the
second round and came up with a way to prevent Senegal from bringing
its buoyant brand of soccer into what could have been a rousing
semifinal with Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   Official killjoy of the tournament, Turkey took out another
popular contender Saturday in Osaka, Japan, when it ground Senegal to
a halt for 90 minutes, then scored a golden goal in the fourth minute
of overtime for a 1-0 quarterfinal victory.</LD>
<TE>   The improbable triumph, delivered by a 94th-minute half-volley
from substitute Ilhan Mansiz, completes a final four field that, it
seems safe to say, never saw the light of day in a single World Cup
office pool: Brazil, Turkey, Germany, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, playing in only its second World Cup, 48 years removed
from its first, will face Brazil in one semifinal Wednesday in
Saitama--a rematch of Brazil's controversial 2-1 Group C victory
three weeks ago. The Turks had two players red-carded and Brazil
received a disputed penalty kick in the first meeting, which left
Turkey talking revenge after having dispatched Senegal.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have beaten [Brazil] in the first match," Turkey Coach
Senol Gunes said, "but we could not. We will do it now.... We have
new plans. We want to play in the final."</TE>
<TE>   Mansiz said the Turks were "unlucky to lose 2-1 to Brazil in the
group stage. Now we have to concentrate on the rematch. I think it
will be a great match."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's unyielding defense, led by goalkeeper Rustu Recber,
recorded its third consecutive shutout by frustrating Senegal's
attackers and sucking much of the life from the match. Turkey had
chances to win in regulation, notably three failed attempts by its
best-known player, Hakan Suker, whose disappointing World Cup has
sunk from bad to worse.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of 12 minutes in the first half, Suker failed to handle
a pass that freed him in front of the Senegal goal, headed weakly
into the arms of Senegal goalkeeper Tony Sylva and was unable to get
his foot on a threatening cross with the net wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Gunes had seen enough and removed Suker from the match in
the 69th minute, replacing him with Mansiz.</TE>
<TE>   Mansiz, who led the Turkish League in scoring last season with 20
goals for Besiktas, almost scored immediately, nearly lobbing over
Sylva. He broke the stalemate in the 94th minute by meeting Umit
Davala's slicing cross and flicking past Sylva just inside the left
post.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't finish in the first 90 minutes," Davala acknowledged,
"but we never gave up."</TE>
<TE>   Senegal was seldom able to launch its fast-breaking offense
against the swarming Turkish defense. The Teranga Lions had their
best chance in the first half but were unlucky in the 19th minute
when Khalilou Fadiga appeared certain to score, only to have his shot
hit teammate Henri Camara two yards from the goal. Camara quickly
knocked the ball into the goal, but the score was nullified when
Camara was ruled offside.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, trying to become the first African team to reach a World
Cup semifinal, had become one of the tournament's feel-good stories
as the Lions upset 1998 champion France in the opener, held on for a
3-3 tie in a wild group game with Uruguay and rallied to eliminate
Sweden in the second round on a golden goal by Camara.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruno Metsu and his players were philosophical after Turkey
had cut the story at least one chapter short.</TE>
<TE>   "I take my hat off to the players," Metsu said. "Not just as
players but as men. They are marvelous men and it is no wonder
everyone has fallen in love with them.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extraordinary what we [have] done and we have learned a
great deal. Yes, we lost to Turkey, but if we made mistakes, they
were down to the errors of youth and enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud of the players. It is a great honor to coach such
a nice, flexible team. They are heroic and to lose in extra time
proves our players are heroes."</TE>
<TE>   El Hadji Diouf, Senegal's star striker, said the defeat was "hard,
hard, hard. But that's how the game goes. It is so hard, but one day
or another the run had to stop--in the quarters, semis or the final.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave it everything, but luck was with Turkey. It's a shame,
but we have no regrets. We could not have done any more."</TE>

<HD>It's a Korean Cinderella Story</HD>
<DH>Quarterfinal: Co-host defeats Spain on penalty kicks after
scoreless game, becoming first Asian nation to go so far.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The 2002 World Cup, which from the beginning has walked the
borderland between fact and fiction, moved ever closer to fantasy
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Co-host South Korea advanced to the semifinals by defeating Spain
on penalty kicks after the teams had battled to a scoreless tie after
two dramatic hours.</LD>
<LD>   A fantasy?</LD>
<TE>   It seemed so for the more than 4 million red-clad fans who took to
the streets of South Korea's major cities Saturday afternoon and then
celebrated late into the night. In Seoul alone, police estimated
crowds at more than 2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed so for the 42,114, including President Kim Dae-Jung, who
packed the World Cup stadium in Gwangju, South Korea, then roared
themselves hoarse urging the home team to greater effort.</TE>
<TE>   And it certainly seemed so for South Korean goalkeeper Lee
Woon-Jae, who made a crucial penalty kick save against Spanish
midfielder Joaquin and then saw Hong Myung-Bo fire the ball past
Spanish keeper Iker Casillas to give the Koreans a 5-3 edge on
penalties and ignite a nationwide party.</TE>
<TE>   A fantasy?</TE>
<TE>   How else to explain that South Korea, which came into this
tournament without a World Cup victory in 14 games over 48 years, is
now unbeaten after five matches?</TE>
<TE>   How else to explain that South Korea has become the first Asian
team in history to reach the final four and only the second
ever--after the United States in 1930--from outside Europe and South
America?</TE>
<TE>   "More dreams have come true," said an elated Guus Hiddink, South
Korea's Dutch coach who has achieved almost saintly status here. "We
will have a little glass of champagne now and what comes tomorrow,
comes tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   What comes tomorrow--or at least Tuesday--is a semifinal game
against Germany, which, based on the difficulty it had in beating the
U.S., is not an insurmountable obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's Go to Yokohama" read the massive banner featuring Hiddink's
portrait that was unfurled from a tall building in central Seoul
after Saturday's success.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese port city is where the World Cup final will be staged
a week from today, and considering the strange way this tournament
has unfolded, who is to say the Koreans won't be there?</TE>
<TE>   A fantasy?</TE>
<TE>   Not when South Korea's achievement was greeted by cheers from
North Korean soldiers on the other side of the Demilitarized Zone, as
Agence France-Presse reported.</TE>
<TE>   Not when Kim, the nation's president, proclaimed Saturday's
triumph as the best thing to happen to Korea in 5,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the happiest day since Dangung and now a new path to
national prosperity has been opened," said Kim, referring to the
monarch, Dangung, who founded Korea 50 centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   It might all have gone wrong for Hiddink's team, however, if Spain
had taken better advantage of the scoring chances it created or had
better luck with the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   There was, for instance, striker Fernando Morientes' shot in
overtime that struck the left post and rebounded clear, and the
header by Morientes that found the back of the net only to be
disallowed because the linesmen--incorrectly, TV replays
showed--ruled that the ball had gone out of bounds before Joaquin
crossed it to Morientes.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, Coach Jose Antonio Camacho and his players were furious
at the way Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour and his assistants (Ali
Tomusange of Uganda and Michael Ragoonath of Trinidad) handled the
game, negating two apparent goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the referee would be fairer in a quarterfinal match
like this," Camacho fumed.</TE>
<TE>   Morientes, filling in for injured striker Raul, was equally
incensed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about the quarterfinals of a World Cup, not a
friendly match played just anywhere," he said. "Two goals disallowed,
that has never been seen."</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, however, refuted any suggestions of bias by the
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not fair," he said of Spain's claims. "Errors are
made--by players, by coaches and by referees and linesmen."</TE>
<TE>   Spain still had a chance when it went to penalties, but South
Korea was flawless. Hwang Sun-Hong, Park Ji-Sung, Seol Ki-Hyeon and
Ahn Jung-Hwan all connected for the home team before Hong netted the
clinching kick.</TE>
<TE>   For Spain, Fernando Hierro, Ruben Baranja and Xavi scored, but Lee
saved Joaquin's shot to ruin Spanish hopes.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea rode the red tide of support generated by its fans.
The "Red Devils" have turned out in massive numbers to watch games on
huge outdoor screens. Almost 10% of the country's population of 48
million was out in force on Saturday, all wearing red.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of the "Be the Reds" T-shirts have exceeded 8 million across
the country, making it almost the national costume.</TE>
<TE>   Spain had no way to counter that type of support on Saturday, just
as Germany will have no answer Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If it is all a dream, it's a fantasy in red.</TE>

<HD>Minority Women Get Left Behind by Title IX</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alisa Carrillo has the resume, the grades, and perhaps most of all,
the potential to play sports for a four-year college. There's just
one thing the best all-around female athlete from Santa Ana
Saddleback High doesn't have: a scholarship.</LD>
<LD>   Few would argue that women athletes are treated better than ever
by colleges and universities. Thanks to Title IX, which became law 30
years ago today, budgets for women's sports have skyrocketed into the
millions and participation seems to spike annually.</LD>
<LD>   But critics say it fails young minority women such as Carrillo.
While Title IX protects women from sex discrimination, statistics
show it has done little to curb racial inequities.</LD>
<TE>   "Title IX has really helped white women," said Tina Sloan Green, a
former national champion lacrosse coach who is executive director of
the Black Women in Sport Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   For example, only 3% of female college athletes are Hispanic and
1.8% are Asian. Outside of basketball and track, 2.7% are black--up
only .7% in the last 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Minority leaders and critics of the statute bristle at those
numbers. They say college administrators trying to comply with Title
IX have selected poorly when adding sports such as crew, equestrian,
golf, ice hockey, lacrosse and water polo.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all sports in which minorities have not traditionally
participated," said Charles Whitcomb, former chairman of the NCAA
Minority Opportunities Committee. "They're traditionally very white,
middle-class sports. They're exclusive to people of color."</TE>
<TE>   James Shulman, a New York-based scholar and coauthor of a book on
college sports, was even more blunt. "There aren't too many
equestrian fields in inner-city L.A., or a lot of 100-meter pools in
the South Bronx," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But even critics note there is no simple solution. Title IX is a
law based on percentages and colleges have struggled making the
numbers add up. Most schools opt to conform to the statute by meeting
a proportionality test; the ratio of male and female athletes must
roughly match the ratio of male and female students in the college
population at large.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of scholarships and athletes on the men's side is
bolstered at many schools by football, a problem for administrators
because no women's sport single-handedly compares. To comply, many
colleges have added women's sports, cut smaller men's sports, or
both.</TE>
<TE>   In just the last three years, women's equestrian teams have been
created at 40 colleges. For equestrian, a school can offer a maximum
of 15 scholarships--as many as a women's basketball team is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   USC offers the NCAA maximum of 20 women's rowing
scholarships--more than any men's sport except football.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo has never tried rowing, having seen it only on television
during the Olympics. But she has been a top performer in just about
every other sport she's tried.</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, she set nearly all of Saddleback's scoring,
rebounding and shot-blocking records and last season was Golden West
League Player of the Year.</TE>
<TE>   She also won four letters in volleyball, and one season "just for
the fun of it," she participated in swimming and softball.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo might be a top golfer, too, but that's anyone's guess
based on reports from her father and brother about the way she
launches shots deep into the local driving range. Saddleback didn't
have a golf team.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo, who is 6 feet tall, didn't play basketball until high
school but worked hard and quickly became a star player. She said she
would have been willing to try rowing or another sport had she known
it offered her a better chance than basketball at a college
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, a woman who loved sports but didn't have the
opportunity to play them in high school spotted a man carrying a row
boat's racing shell on the campus of Connecticut College.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't know what it was, so she asked him about it. The man
was Connecticut's rowing coach, Bart Gulong, and he encouraged Anita
DeFrantz to come out and try the sport because, with an athletic 5-11
build, she'd "be perfect for it."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, DeFrantz won a bronze medal in rowing at the
Montreal Olympics. In 1986, she became the first African American and
first American woman named to the International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   All because of that chance meeting with Gulong.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, DeFrantz has spent countless hours trying to ensure
other women would need to rely only on their ability rather than
luck.</TE>
<TE>   "More work needs to be done in recruiting [minorities] and the
institutions have failed if the sports are not representative of
their student body," DeFrantz said from her office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But many experts believe the breakdown comes long before college.
They say resources should be invested in programs designed
specifically to give urban and lower income youths exposure to more
sports and better training.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like Title IX brought gender diversity, we need to focus now
on bringing opportunity to people of color," Whitcomb said.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the NCAA's Minority Opportunities and Interests
Committee, Dan Guerrero, incoming athletic director at UCLA, helped
create the NCAA Neighborhood Youth Sports Program. University
athletic programs worked with Guerrero's group to help diversify the
pool of athletes in designated sports.</TE>
<TE>   Such programs offer girls exposure to more sports, but they fail
to provide the kind of sophisticated training that develops athletic
skills to a college level.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't solve the problem long term," Guerrero said. "Once the
summer is over those kids don't have an avenue to continue to grow
and learn."</TE>
<TE>   The cost of training is another hurdle. Rowers in the juniors
program at the Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey pay about
$1,300 in annual dues. Sloan Green of the Black Women in Sport
Foundation, whose daughter played tennis for Florida, estimated that
families of top-ranked junior tennis players annually spend around
$30,000 for training and travel to tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the financial reality," Sloan Green said. "Right now
there's an elitist system and those who are penalized are from a
lower socio-economic level."</TE>
<TE>   College coaches are paid to win and are not judged by the
diversity of their teams, so recruiters go to the top club and high
school competitions and generally look for players who are already
highly trained at their sport.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Fuller, UCLA's rowing coach, said she recruits only
competitive rowers, but added, "I tell the coaches in other sports,
'Hey, if you know a good athlete let me know about her' even if she
has never tried rowing.</TE>
<TE>   "They just need to know there are opportunities and hopefully they
have proactive people in their lives to tell them," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan Green is an example of that.</TE>
<TE>   Her early academic success earned her the opportunity to attend
Philadelphia's Girls' High School, for gifted students, where she was
exposed to field hockey, lacrosse and other sports.</TE>
<TE>   She was an athlete at West Chester (Pa.) University, and
eventually ended up coaching field hockey and lacrosse at Temple
University in her hometown. There, her lacrosse teams won three
national titles before she left coaching in 1992 to focus on
foundation work and teaching.</TE>
<TE>   She was the only black women's lacrosse coach in the NCAA Division
I, and one of her proteges, Alison Williams, went on to coach at
Georgetown, becoming only the second black woman to coach at a major
college.</TE>
<TE>   "It all comes down to access," Sloan Green said. "I was blessed to
have been exposed to those sports and turn it into a successful
career. Others then saw they might be successful too. If you don't
have role models there is nothing to suggest to a young girl she
might be successful in that sport too."</TE>
<TE>   Sloan Green is a Title IX proponent, having benefited from it
early in her coaching career, when she was given lacrosse
scholarships to award for the first time. But she believes the system
could be better.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are seriously interested in increasing the number of women
involved in sports, do it across the board," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the urban areas, did they get better facilities behind
Title IX? Has it changed for inner-city girls? I think we need to
investigate why these girls aren't playing these sports."</TE>
<TE>   Donna A. Lopiano, a Title IX watchdog as president of the Women's
Sports Foundation, said she considers gender equity and racial
equality different issues.</TE>
<TE>   "What sports can we add?" she said. "Unless we look at the
pipeline and see where the problem is, we won't be able to solve
participation problem no matter what sport we add."</TE>
<TE>   Lopiano, who is a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee's Diversity
Committee, is challenging national sports governing bodies to gather
baseline data on gender and race participation and report it
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't have data on how many young kids are
participating in these sports," she said. "We don't know their ages
or where they come from. How can you solve the [diversity] problem
without knowing these numbers?"</TE>
<TE>   When or if the current problems are solved, it will probably be
too late for Carrillo, much to the disappoint of her high school
basketball coach, Rob Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad, because Alisa is the type of athlete who can play
whatever she wants to," he said. "You could put her in any sport and
she'd succeed."</TE>

<HD>Greene, Jones Win Titles in 100</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Maurice Greene silenced his top challenger in the men's 100
meters--just barely. Marion Jones still has no American rival in the
women's 100.</LD>
<LD>   Greene edged Tim Montgomery at the U.S. Championships on Saturday
night to win his third national title in the 100. Twenty minutes
earlier, Jones raced to her fourth U.S. title at that distance.</LD>
<LD>   Greene's time of 9.88 seconds would have been the best in the
world this year, but the wind was just over the allowable limit.
Montgomery crossed in 9.89 and Jon Drummond was third in 10.04.</LD>
<TE>   Greene got an excellent start and barely held off Montgomery, who
was the fastest man in the world this season while Greene recovered
from a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   "That probably was the best start I've ever had. Actually it
startled me. I didn't believe I got out that well," said Greene, the
world record-holder at 9.79 and the defending Olympic and world
champion. "I felt him come up on me. I just tried to stay calm, stay
sharp, and that carried me through.</TE>
<TE>   "I rise to every occasion. Tim challenged me, and I welcome every
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   It was another close loss for Montgomery, who had irritated Greene
with his bravado and by questioning Greene's supremacy. After
Saturday's final, Montgomery promised, "I'm going to stop talking."</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's semifinals, Greene beat Montgomery by a comfortable
margin and turned over his left shoulder to stare at his rival as he
crossed the finish line. Montgomery said Saturday he had no problems
with that gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "Dang, I was close again. I can't take all these close ones," he
said. "I'd probably have taken my clothes off if I had won today."</TE>
<TE>   Jones won the women's 100 in 11.01 seconds. Chryste Gaines, a
Stanford graduate and the defending national champion, was second in
11.05 and Kelli White was third in 11.22.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't my best race. I thought I'd run faster," Jones said.
"Overall, I'm happy with the fact that I won."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the defending Olympic champion in the 100, has not lost to
an American at that distance in nearly five years.</TE>
<TE>   That loss, on July 2, 1997, to Gail Devers in Lausanne,
Switzerland, is the only time Jones has lost to an American in a 100
final since she turned pro earlier in '97.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' only loss to anyone in the 100 since the end of 1997 came
last summer at the world championships, where she was edged by Zhanna
Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine. That broke a winning streak of 42 in
100 finals for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been the dominant sprinter the last five or six years. We
can't take anything away from that," Gaines said. "But she can't run
fast by herself. Someone's got to push her. Without us, she couldn't
run fast."</TE>
<TE>   The 100 was not the end of Jones' evening.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours after winning, she easily won her semifinal heat in the

7, 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is the four-time defending national champion in the 200. The
final in that event is today.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's events were run on a warm, breezy night at the
three-day U.S. Championships, a stark contrast to the chill on
Friday's opening night.</TE>
<TE>   Breaux Greer won his third straight U.S. title in the men's
javelin, Adam Nelson won his second national title in the men's shot
put and Yuliana Perez won the women's triple jump.</TE>

<HD>They Must Reload, Not Rebuild</HD>
<DH>Analysis: With an abundance of youth, the U.S. will have a
strong nucleus to build on as it prepares for 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>They came, they saw, they didn't quite conquer but they left
satisfied with what they had accomplished.</LD>
<LD>   That, in a sentence, sums up the sentiment surrounding the United
States World Cup team, which flew home Saturday lifted by the
knowledge that it had restored the credibility of American soccer.</LD>
<LD>   Advancing to the quarterfinals and then not giving an inch in
foot-to-foot combat with Germany was more than could have been hoped
for when Coach Bruce Arena and his players set out on this journey
almost a month ago.</LD>
<TE>   Now the journey is over and Cobi Jones and company can rest easy
in the knowledge that a new generation has to pick up the U.S. banner
and, hopefully, carry it to Germany in 2006 to renew the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Arena will be leading the charge is to be determined. To
judge by his comments Saturday, however, he is hungry for more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of respect," Arena said. "We've earned a little bit
more, but not enough. That's fine. We have to keep moving forward and
try to get better.</TE>
<TE>   "The one way you shut everyone up is you win. You've got to step
on the field and just beat them. Period. Bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line on the 2002 World Cup team was that it went 2-2-1,
scored seven goals and gave up seven goals. It was a .500 achievement
in a tournament in which the majority of the teams did far worse.</TE>
<TE>   Throw out the loss to Poland as an aberration, and the Americans
did just fine.</TE>
<TE>   Among the impressive accomplishments were victories over Portugal
and Mexico and a tie with co-host and semifinalist South Korea. The
U.S. lost, 1-0, to another semifinalist, Germany, but possibly
achieved more in defeat by its never-say-die attitude than it would
have had it won.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Arena wants to hear praise for a valiant effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we should have won," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Germany will play host to the 2006 World Cup, and if the U.S. can
again negotiate the treacherous shoals and rapids of CONCACAF
qualifying play, perhaps the teams will meet again.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the players will be the same.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Friday night's struggle against the U.S., Franz
Beckenbauer, himself a World Cup-winning player and coach and now
head of the Germany 2006 World Cup Organizing Committee, lambasted
the German team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very inadequate performance," he wrote in a column that
appeared in the Saturday edition of the German newspaper Bild.</TE>
<TE>   "Except for 10 minutes before halftime, the Americans were given
free rein on the pitch. There was a lack of movement, a lack of
confidence. The team looked to be frightened.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the favorites, and every player knew that if we had lost
to the Americans the whole football world would have laughed at
us.... We had to use everything we had to stop the Americans."</TE>
<TE>   There is no stopping them now.</TE>
<TE>   In four years' time, Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, both
only 20, will have matured into experienced players hardened, in all
likelihood, by several seasons in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Pablo Mastroeni will have solidified his position in central
midfield.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia duo of Clint Mathis and Josh Wolff will have had time
to refine their skills as goal-hungry forwards.</TE>
<TE>   John O'Brien should be at the height of his power as the man
pulling the strings in midfield.</TE>
<TE>   That's half a starting team right there. The other half awaits
discovery. The players could be appearing in Major League Soccer
right now, awaiting their chance. Players such as Pete Vagenas and
Sasha Victorine; players such as Nick Rimando and Tim Howard, players
such as Carlos Bocanegra and Danny Califf.</TE>
<TE>   It's up to them to stake their claim.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the veterans will be put out to pasture, as it were.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade or more of playing for the national team, they can
get on with their lives, turn their attention to their families,
hopefully become the television commentators and analysts who will
give that soccer wasteland some true perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, along with Jeff Agoos, Carlos Llamosa, Brian McBride, Tony
Meola, Joe-Max Moore, Eddie Pope, David Regis, Earnie Stewart, Tony
Sanneh, Frankie Hejduk, Eddie Lewis and Gregg Berhalter likely have
played their last World Cup game.</TE>
<TE>   "The next team, whoever coaches it, whether it's me or somebody
else, it's a new team for the most part," Arena said. "Start from
scratch. You can just look at the roster and look at the ages of the
players.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a young man's tournament. This isn't for wise, old
veterans."</TE>
<TE>   It is up to others to decide whether they stick around. Claudio
Reyna, for example, will be 32 by the time the 2006 World Cup arrives
and hasn't decided if he wants to sign up for another four-year
hitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably something I'll decide in the next couple of
months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Reyna indicated that he wanted to take two years off from
the national team, perhaps returning when qualifying for 2006 begins
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Steve Cherundolo is only 23 and already plays in Germany.
He could crack the 2006 lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller, meanwhile, are unsure
of their U.S. future.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel, 31, the unquestioned American star of 2002, said he will
"have to look how the next couple of years play out" before deciding
if he wants to make a run at 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Keller will be 36 then and the disappointment of not seeing any
playing time in 2002 after being the starter in 1998 will likely
cause him to focus on his club career.</TE>
<TE>   Arena, on the other hand, can name his price after producing the
best American World Cup performance in 72 years. Chances are he will
be back.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a bright future for the game in the United States," he
said after Friday night's game. "We have shown the world that we can
play."</TE>

<HD>Irate Italians' E-Mails Lead to Crash of FIFA System Server</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIFA has received about 400,000 hateful e-mails from fans of Italy
irate over refereeing they say was to blame for their team's
elimination from the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said some of the e-mail was "virulent,
some quite abusive, some of them very threatening, some of them quite
disturbing."</LD>
<LD>   The Internet traffic was so great that it crashed FIFA's e-mail
system server, he said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The Italians complained about the officiating after they lost,
2-1, to Croatia in group play, then after they were knocked out of
the tournament in a 2-1 overtime loss to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA President Sepp Blatter has denied any conspiracy, but
acknowledged that some bad calls had been made.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Spain to the growing list of critics condemning World Cup
referees. Coach Jose Antonio Camacho was furious at the referee and
linesmen for disallowing three goals Saturday before South Korea
knocked Spain out of the tournament in a penalty-kick shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter said some linesmen were "a disaster," and Pele, perhaps
soccer's best player ever and now an ambassador for the sport, said
"the level of referees is very poor, very low."</TE>
<TE>   Camacho said Italy, Mexico, Portugal and the United States all
were on the end of bad calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected the officiating to be better. This was a quarterfinal
match after all," Camacho said. "I'm sad because we lost unfairly."</TE>
<TE>   Prominent referee Edgardo Codesal Mendez said there will always be
mistakes. He said out of some 4,000 decisions in the first 56 games
of the World Cup, only a handful were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The start of the second day of the European Union summit in
Seville, Spain, was delayed for an hour Saturday so the 15 leaders
and many hundreds of diplomats and journalists could watch summit
host Spain play South Korea in a World Cup quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   "The Spanish told all delegations on Friday night the summit would
not resume on Saturday until 10 a.m.," EU spokeswoman Cristina
Gallach said. "They gave no reason, but I think you can figure this
out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany has appealed to FIFA to annul the yellow card given to
striker Oliver Neuville in Friday's 1-0 quarterfinal victory over the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The foul was committed by midfielder Jens Jeremies but was wrongly
attributed to Neuville by Scottish referee Hugh Dallas, the team
said.</TE>

<HD>Canada Arrests Suspect in Bomb Plot</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>MONTREAL -- Canadian anti-terrorism police have arrested a man
suspected of helping militants who were planning to bomb the U.S.
Embassy in Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Adel Tobbichi, 34, was arrested Friday in Montreal as the result
of an extradition request from the Netherlands, Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Constable Richard Huard said. Police also searched his
Montreal home.</LD>
<LD>   Dutch police allege that Tobbichi, of Algerian origin, altered
passports and other documents and provided them to militants planning
to bomb the embassy. Huard said officials were unsure whether
Tobbichi was a Canadian citizen.</LD>
<TE>   Dutch authorities already are holding two French citizens they
believe were involved in the bombing plot.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in Rotterdam, Netherlands, have said they have tapes
of wiretaps linking the pair, Jerome Courtailler and Mohammed
Berkous, both 27, to the designated suicide bomber, Nizar Trabelsi,
who is under arrest in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   The tapes prove that Courtailler and Berkous had spoken to
Trabelsi about arranging passports and a safe house for him in the
Netherlands, Dutch prosecutor Theo D'Anjou said this month.</TE>
<TE>   Tobbichi's arrest was made by Canada's Integrated National
Security Enforcement Team, which was set up in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tobbichi was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday for an
arraignment that will start the extradition process, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Huard said there was no information yet connecting Tobbichi with
the Montreal-based terrorist cell that helped Algerian terrorist
Ahmed Ressam in a plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on
New Year's Eve 1999. Ressam was arrested when he tried to enter the
United States from Canada and was later convicted.</TE>

<LD>Tanzania suspended all mining in the north of the country after 42
tanzanite miners died because of a failed oxygen pump.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of miners were trying to recover the bodies of their
colleagues. Fourteen bodies had been brought up. The bodies are about
410 feet deep in the ground and 985 feet along the shaft
horizontally.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Ole Njoolay, the regional commissioner for Arusha,
announced the mining halt after visiting the site of Thursday's
accident in Mererani, 25 miles southeast of Arusha. Mererani is the

<HD>EU Plans to Beef Up Borders</HD>
<DH>Summit: Proposal to crack down on nations associated with
illegal immigration is tempered. Leaders agree to coordinate
policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEVILLE, Spain</DL>
<LD>European leaders meeting here adopted a regional strategy Saturday to
fight illegal immigration, responding to increasingly desperate
border crossings and a backlash against the arrival of half a million
clandestine migrants a year.</LD>
<LD>   The leaders of the 15-nation European Union agreed to beef up
border enforcement and coordinate policies on visas and political
asylum. But they watered down a tough proposal by Spain, Italy and
Britain to impose economic sanctions on nations whose authorities
tolerate or participate in organized smuggling of immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to act without demagoguery and with realism," said
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who holds the rotating EU
presidency. "We are all in agreement that immigration is positive, if
the migratory flows are orderly and compatible with the law."</LD>
<TE>   Urged on by Aznar, a pragmatic reformer who has gotten tough with
terrorism and illegal immigration in this country, the leaders were
confronting a problem that tops their domestic agendas. Especially
since Sept. 11, politics across the continent have been reshaped by
immigration, an issue that intertwines with fears of rising crime and
Islamic extremism and with the difficulty of integrating Muslims into
European societies. Recent elections have brought notable gains by
candidates demanding border crackdowns, whether far rightists in
France, populists in the Netherlands or regional partisans in
northern Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The dramas on the coasts of Spain and Italy--ragged refugees
hurdling fences, dilapidated smuggling ships intercepted at sea,
corpses washing up on beaches--resemble those on the U.S.-Mexico
border and in southern Florida. And because Europe has done away with
most of its internal borders, the EU states must work together with
an urgency that runs counter to the union's typically slow and
contentious nature.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to tensions in Seville was an onset of violence by Basque
separatists. As expected by Spanish police, the ETA terrorist
organization used the presence of the European heads of
government--and of 3,000 journalists--to launch its yearly summer
campaign of mayhem aimed at tourist regions.</TE>
<TE>   There were five bombings Friday and Saturday: three in beach
resorts on the southern coast and one each in Zaragoza and Santander
in the north. Police reported 10 casualties, all minor except for a
British tourist who was in serious condition after a car bombing near
a hotel in Fuengirola, about 95 miles south of Seville.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Aznar, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Italian Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi found consensus on the need to harmonize
policies on visas and political refugees. Asylum laws now are wildly
divergent: Alleged Al Qaeda terror bosses have lived in London as
high-profile political refugees, while French officials grumble that
these individuals would be arrested if they crossed the Channel.</TE>
<TE>   The plan adopted in Seville will provide more resources for border
enforcement in front-line nations and will lay the foundation for a
common border police agency and Europe-wide anti-smuggling task
forces. It spells out a policy for working with countries from which
migrant flows originate--Albania, Morocco, Turkey, the former
Yugoslav republics--to repatriate captured illegal immigrants and
otherwise improve cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The most ambitious proposal on the table called for denying
generous EU economic aid to countries that egregiously fail to
cooperate. Albania and Morocco are classic examples of "sending"
countries where corruption and lawlessness enable smuggling
industries to transport migrants from Africa, the Middle East and
Asia, according to Spanish and Italian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish officials are especially exasperated with Morocco, whose
northern coast is the base for ramshackle flotillas of smuggling
craft bound for the Canary Islands and the Gibraltar coast.</TE>
<TE>   Moroccan leaders respond that they are doing their best, and warn
that economic sanctions would worsen the poverty and unemployment
that cause immigration. European critics of the anti-immigrant wave,
especially in France and Sweden, say it is part of a misguided
"Fortress Europe" mentality.</TE>
<TE>   At the summit, France was a stubborn dissenting voice. Inspired by
the country's close ties to Morocco, Algeria and other former
colonies in North Africa, French opposition forced Spain, Italy and
Britain to back away from the original carrot-and-stick approach.</TE>
<TE>   The document approved Saturday will nonetheless set up a mechanism
to conduct "a systematic evaluation of relations with third countries
that do not collaborate with the fight against illegal immigration."
In exceptional cases, Aznar said, the EU could predicate future
economic aid on improved border enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "This debate about 'Fortress Europe' is absurd," he said. "The law
is made to be obeyed."</TE>

<HD>2 Chinese Villages Battle Over Hometown Hero--and Tourist
Cash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JIANGWAN, China</DL>
<LD>Jiang Zhenzhong stopped the clock at 11:05 a.m. and fixed the
calendar at May 30, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   That was the moment the most powerful man in the world's most
populous nation had graced this peasant's living room.</LD>
<LD>   "He sat for 18 minutes and ate three peanuts," Jiang recalled. "I
saved the shells."</LD>
<TE>   President Jiang Zemin dropped by last year during a tour of
Jiangxi province. The region had made headlines with scandalous
reports of schoolchildren, forced to make fireworks, dying in a
horrific explosion.</TE>
<TE>   But the Communist Party chief's entourage put the region on the
map for a different reason--a visit to his ancestral home.</TE>
<TE>   It's nothing short of divine intervention for this economically
strapped inland province.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents in this little-known village proudly share their
president's last name, which means Big River. They're betting on the
Jiang connection to bring them fortune and fame, through lots and
lots of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is, exactly where the president's ancestors
actually lived remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Another village, Jiangcun, in neighboring Anhui province, insists
that it's the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are his ancestral home, I'm 200% sure," said Huang Jun, a
Jiangcun official.</TE>
<TE>   Jiangwan begs to differ. "Chairman Jiang is a descendant of
Jiangwan, that's undeniable," said Wu Yuangen, a tourism manager in
the village.</TE>
<TE>   Blame the confusion on history.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese traditionally kept detailed records of their roots.
But during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, precious genealogy books
were destroyed, as well as the family temples that give clues to
one's past.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that the president was born in coastal Jiangsu
province. His grandfather had moved there from somewhere along this
picturesque mountain valley, in the border region between Jiangxi and
Anhui provinces.</TE>
<TE>   The area is blessed with lush green forests and graceful rural
architecture. Its chalk-white walls and charcoal-colored roofs were
featured in the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</TE>
<TE>   During his visit here, the president downplayed his family
connection. Since the death of Communist founding father Mao
Tse-tung, Beijing has considered the cult of personality taboo.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, locals are prohibited from selling any trinket
with a portrait of the president or flaunt his kinship, even though
the government supports tourism as a new cash cow for poor farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials carefully scrutinize all publicity materials,
keeping them deliberately vague. A large mural of the president
visiting a local school greets tourists at the entrance to the
village. Its slogan reads simply: "Together with Grandfather Jiang."
A guidebook describes Jiangwan as "Home of a Great Man." But it
doesn't name names.</TE>
<TE>   What prompted Chairman Jiang's search for his roots? Ordinary
people will probably never know. But they have their guesses.</TE>
<TE>   According to one version, the president had planned to look for
his ancestral home after he steps down next year as China's top boss.
But a few years ago, devastating floods around the country apparently
sent him scrambling for help from unusual sources. A Buddhist priest
reportedly told him that he was a dragon (Chinese symbol for emperor)
and a river (his name). Both water signs. The only way to stop the
flooding, he was told, was to pay respects to his ancestors. Thus the
journey back to his roots.</TE>
<TE>   This of course can't be the official story, because the Communists
are atheists and opposed to any kind of superstition.</TE>
<TE>   But the tour did fuel the competition between Jiangcun and
Jiangwan, which mean, respectively, River Village and River Bay. The
president visited both villages.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Jiang read the Jiang family registry and visited the
Jiang family temple," said Huang, the Jiangcun official. "We have
solid proof. Jiangwan has nothing."</TE>
<TE>   He's partly right.</TE>
<TE>   Most physical connections to Jiangwan's No. 1 son no longer exist.
But villagers claim to have enough historic evidence, based on oral
history of village elders and the president's relatives, to know that
they are the authentic branch of the Jiang clan.</TE>
<TE>   "They can say whatever they want," said Jiangwan's Wu. "If you
don't believe me, ask Chairman Jiang."</TE>
<TE>   That, apparently, isn't necessary (or, for that matter, possible).
Thousands of tourists have already flocked to Jiangwan to peek at
farmer Jiang Zhenzhong's house, sit in the hard wooden chair where
the president sat and imagine for a moment what it's like to be a
modern emperor.</TE>
<TE>   The mansion in Jiangwan that Jiang's ancestors supposedly built
collapsed more than 20 years ago. Only overgrown bush and broken
stones remain. The original occupants of the Jiang family mansion
were condemned as "landlords" and kicked out after the Communist
revolution in 1949. Eight peasant families moved in.</TE>
<TE>   "After some of the walls started to crumble, we tore down the rest
of the house, sold the good timber and burned the rest," said Jiang
Changrui, who was born in the house 49 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another vanished landmark is the ancestral temple for this branch
of the Jiang clan.</TE>
<TE>   The Communists turned the grand house of worship into the village
headquarters. Then the people's commune leader bulldozed it and
replaced it with something more suitable for the proletariat.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the presidential visit, Jiangwan's leaders are trying to
undo the past. A new multimillion-dollar family temple and mansion
are on their way up.</TE>
<TE>   For poor peasants who suddenly found the path to new wealth, it's
the faith that matters.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows for sure where he's from," confessed Jiang Changrui,
who hawks antique pottery. "Even Chairman Jiang has asked us to stop
guessing."</TE>

<LD>   Many of the Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners held here are Muslim
extremists reluctant to make eye contact with a woman, let alone sell
out their cause to one. Yet Marie, an Army interrogator, has loosened
the tongues of dozens of detainees, including a senior Al Qaeda
operative. Her approach, like Marie herself, is both disarming and
icily direct.</LD>
<TE>   "The hardest thing I've had to do is be nice to these people," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You go in there, bring them coffee, trying to make them think
you're their friend. They're not my friend. Most of the people we
talk to are really the enemy. To convince them that the best possible
thing they can do is tell us the truth--it's a little piece of
revenge."</TE>
<TE>   The machinery of war clamors continuously here at America's
forward base in Afghanistan, as armored vehicles and Chinook
helicopters rumble and explosions echo off the surrounding hills. But
Marie is part of another operation at Bagram that goes about its
business in virtual silence.</TE>
<TE>   In a boarded-up warehouse ringed with barbed wire, she and other
U.S. interrogators seek to pry information from captured Al Qaeda and
Taliban operatives.</TE>
<TE>   In air-conditioned tents stocked with scanners, laptops and
digital cameras, crews of linguists and analysts comb through
materials taken from Al Qaeda caves and safe houses. Among the more
than 20,000 documents recovered are lists of Al Qaeda leaders killed
in battle, detailed diaries from terrorist training camps and
long-winded letters to Arab leaders from Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   As military operations go, interrogating prisoners and poring over
documents are generally not the stuff of which heroes are made. But
the war on terrorism is unlike any other war in its dependence on
intelligence, and the interrogators and "document exploitation" teams
in Afghanistan occupy a crucial front. Sometimes derided by their
combat peers as "intel weenies," the interrogation unit at Bagram
recently commissioned T-shirts with a message of uncharacteristic
bravado.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest battle," the shirts read, "is the battle of wits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operations That Are Cloaked in Secrecy</TE>
<TE>   The battle of wits is among the most carefully cloaked aspects of
the war. Those involved generally aren't allowed to tell even their
families what they do. Most of those interviewed for this story--in
Afghanistan, Kuwait and the United States--asked that their full
names not be disclosed. No access was granted to prisoners, and
officials discussed only in general terms the information gleaned
from interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   The significance of their painstaking work has been demonstrated
several times since Sept. 11, as kernels of information collected in
Afghanistan have enabled authorities around the world to shut down
terrorist cells and disrupt plots.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most striking examples, authorities in Singapore
said that in December they broke up an Al Qaeda cell planning to bomb
a shuttle bus carrying U.S. military personnel. Officials said
details of the plot came from interrogations of a prisoner in
Afghanistan and from handwritten notes picked out of the rubble of an
Al Qaeda leader's house.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, U.S. officials have detained an American citizen
accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive bomb on U.S. soil. The
tip was said to have come from Abu Zubeida, a top Al Qaeda operative
captured in Pakistan. But defense officials said some of the details
about the "dirty bomb" scheme also came from documents found in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence job in Afghanistan has come under some criticism.
When U.S. helicopters were ambushed at the outset of Operation
Anaconda in March and eight soldiers died, Pentagon officials
whispered that intelligence had let them down.</TE>
<TE>   The job is also incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't found Osama bin Laden yet, and I'd be lying if I said
that wasn't a low," said Maj. David Carstens, 35, the operational
leader of the Army's interrogation and document teams in Afghanistan.
"Sometimes you can go through all sorts of interrogations, all sorts
of documents, and the information just isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Similarities Between Military, Civilian Roles</TE>
<TE>   Though the CIA and FBI have captured most of the intelligence
headlines, good and bad, in the war on terrorism, much of the heavy
lifting in Afghanistan is being done by an unlikely collection of
troops and civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Marie, who asked to be identified only by her middle name,
attended college briefly before joining the Army and hopes to become
a schoolteacher.</TE>
<TE>   Many of her colleagues are reservists. The head of the army
interrogation team at Bagram, Chris, is a 30-year-old reserve
sergeant plucked last winter from his civilian job as a corporate tax
specialist in the London office of the accounting firm KPMG. Another
interrogator, Ed, was until recently a public relations consultant at
Fleischman-Hillard in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Both noted that their civilian and military jobs are not entirely
dissimilar. In interrogation work, Ed said, "everything that you say
matters. How the room is set up matters. That's the same in public
relations. Everything is a rehearsed event."</TE>
<TE>   Many military intelligence soldiers were gifted students who
entered the armed services to pay for college. Others went to college
briefly but didn't finish.</TE>
<TE>   After enlisting, they were singled out for special training
because they posted top scores on military entrance exams or had
already mastered multiple languages.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogators begin learning the art of unlocking an enemy's
secrets at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz. Recruits are taught dozens of
techniques, ranging from displays of violent temper designed to
heighten a detainee's anxiety to gentle approaches--questions about
personal life and other comfortable subjects--meant to soothe a
prisoner on the verge of panic.</TE>
<TE>   They also become experts at reading body language and facial
expression--tics hard-wired into human nature that tend to transcend
culture. Looking up and to the left while answering a question, for
instance, is a sign of "visual construction," Chris said, an evasive
gesture that usually means the speaker is about to fabricate a scene.</TE>
<TE>   Torture is neither taught nor tolerated, U.S. officials insist.
Interrogators at Bagram said they never engage in physical coercion.</TE>
<TE>   Some take great pride in the mental gamesmanship of their craft.</TE>
<TE>   Chris keeps his desk stocked with copies of a book, "The
Interrogator," that is practically required reading for his team. It
is the story of Hans Scharff, the master German interrogator who
during World War II coaxed secrets from countless American pilots
while barely raising his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogators don't deny using tactics designed to unnerve or
disorient. They summon prisoners for questioning in the middle of the
night and play on their anxieties about where they might be sent
next. Most detainees would rather take their chances with Americans
than be turned over to the wobbly Afghan government or repatriated to
countries with few qualms about physical punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The interrogation sequence itself can be unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners are shorn of their hair, outfitted in prison jumpsuits
and kept isolated. They are led to the interview "booths" with hoods
over their heads and with military police clutching their arms.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing leg irons and with hands cuffed behind their backs, they
sit down at the edge of a table, waiting for the interrogator and, in
most cases, translator to enter the booth. Armed MPs guard the
entrance to the room.</TE>
<TE>   The opening moments of the interview are carefully scripted,
usually unproductive, and yet unfailingly intense for both sides. One
interrogator likened the adrenaline surge that accompanies entering
the booth to the rush football players feel at kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   The psychological profiling of prisoners begins the moment they
are captured. Soldiers at the scene scribble down everything they
observe onto sticky "capture tags" that are slapped onto prisoners'
backs.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll know who in the group [captured] was assuming the
leadership role, who was the most scared," Chris said. "Was a certain
prisoner eager to surrender, or was he captured after spending every
round of ammunition in a last-ditch fight?"</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers take note of which detainee was closest to a radio or
phone, because radio operators tend to have access to high-level
information.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogators also pore over a prisoner's belongings for any
glimpse into what he holds dear. Did he have a picture of family in
his pocket? Was he carrying cigarettes, prayer beads or a worn page
from the Koran? Such items can be withheld or bestowed depending on a
detainee's willingness to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Interrogators spend hours rehearsing their approach, weaving in
questions drawn from a list of "priority intelligence requirements"
that tend to center on the obvious: the whereabouts of Bin Laden and
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, immediate threats to U.S.
forces, and Al Qaeda's plans and capabilities around the world.</TE>
<TE>   One subject that interrogators broach very carefully with
detainees is Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I've shown pictures of the World Trade Center," Ed said. "I don't
use it to argue. I just introduce it as a prop. Sometimes that image
can convey why we're here and how personal and serious this is to us.
But it's not always wise to remind these men of wider ideological
disputes. Some of them were glad about those towers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Small-Scale Mission Expanded Rapidly</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until mid-December, more than two months after the
launch of U.S. airstrikes, that a military intelligence outpost began
to take shape in Afghanistan on a cold airstrip in Kandahar, the
birthplace of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the troops arrived Christmas Day, just in time for
midnight Mass in a frigid terminal whose windows had been blown out
by the vibrations of U.S. bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The Army's 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion--whose motto is
"Collect and exploit"--had packed light when it left Ft. Gordon, Ga.,
for what was supposed to be a small-scale mission. Its job quickly
mushroomed as the Taliban collapsed and U.S.-led Afghan forces rolled
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   As Al Qaeda and Taliban forces fled, they left behind stashes of
documents and other pieces of evidence that U.S. troops--then mainly
directing the efforts of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance--weren't
in position to collect.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials were aghast as Al Qaeda safe houses and
caves were picked over by journalists and by Afghan scavengers
recognizing an opportunity to gather materials for which U.S.
intelligence operatives might pay top dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "People were saying, 'What the heck is Geraldo doing holding up
documents?' " recalled Col. Daniel Baker, a senior Army intelligence
commander who oversees aspects of the operation from a command post
in Kuwait. "We had to wade through civilians holding papers saying,
'Five dollar! Five dollar! Five dollar!' "</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledge that they may never recover many important
documents but believe that they amassed a considerable archive on Al
Qaeda after the U.S. troop presence grew.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces were also hampered by a severe shortage of linguists
who could make sense of the mountains of documents and help
interrogate the growing number of prisoners. The Army, which tracks
the language abilities of its 1 million soldiers and reservists,
could find only one fluent in Pashto.</TE>
<TE>   Even companies hired to help find translators struggled to locate
people fluent in Dari, Pashto and Urdu. Titan Systems Corp., a San
Diego defense contractor, spent fruitless weeks poring over resumes
on Internet job sites until a 29-year-old manager at the company
posted a message on several Yahoo message boards frequented by
expatriate Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is Scott," the message began. "Our company is looking for
linguists who are willing to go to Afghanistan to support U.S.
military operations."</TE>
<TE>   Soon Titan was fielding as many as 75 applications a day, many
from native Afghans whose families had fled the country when the
Soviets invaded in 1979 and were eager to revisit their homeland
under escort of the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   Among those hired are a partner in a San Diego pharmaceuticals
company, a software engineer from Texas and an accountant who was
once a commander in the anti-Soviet moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   All those chosen are U.S. citizens screened by the Pentagon to
handle classified material. They are paid $6,000 to $8,000 a month,
triple the amount made by the soldiers they work alongside. At
Bagram, documents continue to arrive by the bushel, often simply
stuffed in trash bags after getting a quick once-over by the soldiers
who found them. Defense Intelligence Agency teams sort through the
incoming piles, tagging them according to where and when they were
found, and scanning them into a classified computer system called
Harmony that is accessible to every branch of the U.S. intelligence
community.</TE>
<TE>   Transmitted electronically across the Atlantic, the digitized
documents are scrutinized at a center in northern Virginia, where the
DIA and CIA have 50 translators and analysts working two shifts a
day.</TE>
<TE>   The materials--which include not only documents but also
videotapes, discs and computer hard drives--are ultimately boxed and
shipped to a secret Washington facility.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of it is low-grade junk," said Capt. Mike Kuhn,
who oversees the document exploitation operation at the DIA in
Washington. "But we have also had some very significant finds."</TE>
<TE>   Several officials said the most valuable discovery was a small
library found at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan called
Tarnak Farms showing Al Qaeda's interest in chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Other discoveries included a training camp diary, described by one
official as "the graduate notes of a terrorist," that spans hundreds
of pages and describes in detail Al Qaeda lessons in such skills as
digging mortar positions, attaching car bombs and arranging
minefields.</TE>
<TE>   During Operation Anaconda, U.S. forces found what Carstens called
a "book of dead," listing senior Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters killed
in action since the beginning of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like they were running mortuary affairs," keeping
logs so families could be notified and burial arrangements made,
Carstens said. "It gave us good insight into how their command
structure was faring."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has also collected dozens of letters written by
Al Qaeda leaders to officials and religious leaders around the world.
Many were requests for favors, arms and money, helping the United
States determine where Al Qaeda found international support.
Officials wouldn't elaborate except to say that some material has
implicated Iran, which CIA Director George J. Tenet this year accused
of interference in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although none of the recovered material has pointed authorities to
the hiding places of Bin Laden or Omar, Carstens said, numerous
documents bear their signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is a vitriolic, 44-page letter that Bin Laden wrote to
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd in 1995. The missive provides a glimpse into
Bin Laden's mind a year after he'd been stripped of his Saudi
citizenship and a year before the CIA set up a special unit to track
him.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden expresses disgust with Fahd's links to the West. "There
is nothing more symbolic of your foreign policy," he writes, "than
your ties to the interests of the Western crusaders and infidel
systems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Processing People as Well as Papers</TE>
<TE>   Bagram is the initial stop for prisoners as well as documents. Its
detention center, and another at a U.S. base at Kandahar, is designed
to hold prisoners for a few months at most.</TE>
<TE>   About 170 people are in custody at the two facilities. Thousands
of others have been released or turned over to the Afghan government.
And 460 have been sent to the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
for in-depth questioning by the CIA and FBI.</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram, the only visible evidence that prisoners are present is
a steady plume of smoke from metal drums in which detainees' waste is
incinerated.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the low-slung detention building, there are six
interrogation booths, cells for holding prisoners, a lounge for
interrogators and military police, and a large open room lined with
maps, marker boards and laptop computers that is the nerve center for
the operation.</TE>
<TE>   At a workstation in the middle of the room, Chris manages a team
of dozens of interrogators and analysts. Like a baseball manager, a
big part of his job is filling out the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   He ranks incoming prisoners by how much they are presumed to know
and assigns interrogators based partly on their effectiveness in the
booth, but also on how their personalities match up with that of the
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Marie, who has sandy blond hair and stands about 5 feet tall,
"couldn't scare somebody," Chris said. "She wouldn't be called upon
to increase someone's anxiety, and she can't talk to fanatics who
won't talk to women."</TE>
<TE>   But Marie "thinks with a logic that is unstoppable and has an
instinct for what is important," Chris said. And she is frequently
assigned to handle high-level prisoners partly because she is the
last person they expect to confront.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely unsettling [for detainees] to find themselves
sitting across from what looks like a 19-year-old," Chris said.
"They're expecting someone my age, and they're probably expecting to
get roughed up."</TE>
<TE>   In March, Marie gained the notice of top Pentagon officials in
Washington, including Army Secretary Thomas E. White, for her work
with one of the top Al Qaeda officials in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to identify the prisoner except to say that he
is a high-ranking operative who has been singled out by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft as a wanted terrorist but whose capture has not been
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Over a period of weeks, the prisoner became very attached to
Marie, enamored of their frequent conversations, and agitated when
sessions were skipped. Military officials said he is gay and saw
Marie as a nonthreatening presence, telling her that he had known few
people in his life whom he could trust but that he felt he could
trust her and wouldn't disappoint her.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, authorities didn't recognize the prisoner as a
significant operative. He blended in with the group he was captured
with. Their stories raised little suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Marie said, "it started to seem like he was overly
excited to help us." Desperate to prove that he was cooperative, he
talked of his admiration for what the U.S. was accomplishing in
Afghanistan, and even tattled on the insignificant offenses of other
detainees.</TE>
<TE>   His eagerness made Marie so nervous that she began rereading his
file and transcripts of their conversations, looking for holes in his
story. She didn't find any.</TE>
<TE>   Then, new information from other sources made it clear that this
prisoner had another identity, and a much larger Al Qaeda role, that
he hadn't disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Marie was crestfallen.</TE>
<TE>   "He had fooled me," she said. "I was pretty upset I'd overlooked
something as large as this was. I felt like I'd just lost my whole
life savings."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of confronting him, Marie laid a psychological trap.
During their next session, she tossed out the detainee's secret
identity casually, as if she had simply overheard a new name. "How do
you pronounce this?" she asked. "Am I saying it right?"</TE>
<TE>   The detainee began sweating. "You're saying it right," he replied.
"But that's not me." Until that moment, the prisoner had not
explicitly lied. Seizing on this, Marie began to prey on his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   She brought him letters from other interrogators lamenting his
duplicity. She staged a shouting match with him and had two burly MPs
poke into the interrogation booth and shake their heads in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   A prisoner who had spent much of his energy trying to impress his
American captors suddenly saw his standing with them--and,
implicitly, his fate--sliding into uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, he confessed, admitting not only his identity, but
also plots he and others had been training and planning for.
Officials declined to elaborate, except to say that he was an Al
Qaeda operative who had made direct threats against the United
States, and ultimately provided information concerning other members
of the terrorist network in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Not every interrogation ends in success. Al Qaeda taught members
to resist interrogation and confuse captors. But most prisoners,
interrogators say, are confused, scared and motivated mainly by
self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Marie said most of the 70 or so prisoners she has
interrogated have been cooperative and even exhibited signs of
gaining new respect for her gender.</TE>
<TE>   "True, some have had their choice of words for me," she said. "But
when they realize that where they travel next depends on the opinion
of a woman, not only does that put them in their place, it scares the
bejesus out of them."</TE>

<HD>500 Killed, Thousands Injured in Iran Quake</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Rescue teams searched for survivors early today after a powerful
earthquake killed hundreds of people, injured thousands more and
crumbled an estimated 5,000 homes Saturday across a mountainous
farming region of Iran west of Tehran.</LD>
<LD>   Iran's official news agency put the death toll at 500, injuries at
2,000 and those made homeless at 25,000--but crews were just
beginning to assess the damage, bodies were still being located, and
hospitals in the region were swamped far beyond capacity with
victims.</LD>
<LD>   It will take time before anyone knows for certain the number of
dead.</LD>
<TE>   The quake struck in a region where most people live in houses made
of mud, timber and plaster, materials that disintegrate in an
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "Inhabitants in the affected areas are horrified," said the
Iranian news agency.</TE>
<TE>   The earthquake struck about 7:30 a.m., had a preliminary magnitude
of 6.3 and was centered in Qazvin province, 140 miles west of Tehran.
It caused the greatest damage across an area known primarily for its
seedless grapes, but also as a getaway for wealthy residents of the
capital. Many local men already were tending to their vineyards when
the earth shook. Many women, children and elderly were home--and made
up most of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could see was trees and dirt. There was 100% destruction of
the houses," said Kamyar Entezami, a 22-year-old photography student
in the village of Changoureh. "I saw 40 bodies, a lot of them
children."</TE>
<TE>   Based on eyewitness accounts, the situation in Changoureh appears
to have been all too typical. In the small village of Esmailabad, 38
bodies had been recovered by late Saturday, indicating that one in
nine members of the community was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost everyone," wailed one survivor in Esmailabad as he
poured dirt over his head in grief.</TE>
<TE>   In Aliabad, another small village in the vicinity, two shepherds
who had left their houses early in the morning appeared to be the
only survivors, state television reported. Everyone else was presumed
dead.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 people were killed in Kisse-Jin village, Majid Shalviri,
head of the Red Crescent Society in Qazvin, told the state news
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of injured people is very high. Exact figures are
still not available, but there will be many casualties," Shalviri
said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran sits atop one of the most earthquake-prone areas of the
Earth, a seismically active region where three tectonic plates meet,
rub against one another and collide. Tremors occur almost daily,
although major quakes are infrequent. In 1990, a quake in northern
Iran killed more than 40,000 people, injured 60,000 and left more
than half a million homeless. One thousand villages were damaged or
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The quake that struck Saturday shattered tranquil villages that
lie along a road linking two large cities, Hamadan and Qazvin.
Officials said the epicenter was in the Bouynzahra district in
Qazvin. A senior Qazvin government official said on state-run
television that 177 bodies had been recovered there. But the quake
could be felt across eight provinces, including Gilan, Kurdestan,
Zanjan and Hamadan.</TE>
<TE>   "The quake was felt as far away as the capital, where buildings
swayed and glasses broke," said Borzou Daragahi, a Tehran-based
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian Red Crescent Society said that nearly 100 villages
were badly damaged or destroyed and that an estimated 5,000 houses
were demolished. State television showed images of vast destruction,
homes reduced to dust, survivors wailing over corpses.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very sad to see the sights of ruined homes of the people of
these villages," said Behrouzef Tashakor, a journalist from the
village of Abdareh, one of the worst-hit areas. The quake toppled
Abdareh's mosque, destroyed 40 homes and left at least 20 people
dead. The only thing not damaged was the hilltop cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Some villages reported frustration with delays in the arrival of
rescue workers. By nightfall Saturday, helicopters were ferrying
teams of rescuers to the stricken region. Soldiers, civilians and
other volunteers, often armed with no more than shovels and spades,
were digging in search of survivors or bodies. Officials said that
food and 2,500 tents had been delivered to the affected region.</TE>
<TE>   There were several obstacles to the rescue effort. Although warm
during the day, the villages grow frigid at night, making rescue work
more difficult while threatening the health of the homeless as well
as anyone alive but trapped. Another problem was the fear of
aftershocks, which the Iranian news agency said could continue for up
to two weeks. The news service said there had been many in the hours
after the quake.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Oshea of International Rescue participated in the rescue
effort after quakes hit Iran in 1990 and 1997. In an interview with
the BBC on Saturday, he said that Iran does not have high-tech
equipment, or even sniffer dogs, to help in the effort. He also said
that the religious leadership is often reluctant to bring in help.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it is going to be the ideal opportunity over the
next hours to pull survivors out alive," Oshea told the BBC. "Bearing
in mind from my experience 10 years ago, the traditional build of the
buildings are a key cause of death. However, in 1990, they did pull
some people out after 21 days--so it's a bit hit-and-miss at the
moment."</TE>
<TE>   The shudder felt in Tehran also renewed concerns about a city of
an estimated 20 million that rests over a series of seismic faults.
This quake struck in a relatively sparsely populated area. But some
Iranian experts have warned that Tehran could be hit too.</TE>
<TE>   The Tehran skyline boasts many tall new condominiums, and with
demand for swanky Western-style housing on the rise, developers are
looking to build more skyscrapers. This has led to warnings from
seismologists who fear that a disaster could be in the offing if
shaking occurs beneath the capital.</TE>
<TE>   President Mohammad Khatami issued a condolence message to the
nation, and three days of mourning have been declared in the
provinces, state television said.</TE>

<HD>Way With Words Is Karzai's Main Asset in Afghan Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The future of Afghanistan's new transitional president, Hamid Karzai,
and of the country itself hangs on a thin reed: words.</LD>
<LD>   As a leader who won power without commanding an army, Karzai is
betting on his not inconsiderable powers of moral suasion to make
Afghanistan into "a country of laws, of institution," he says.</LD>
<LD>   His first effort to rely on such invisible force appears to have
worked. A two-day protest by soldiers and police employees at the
Interior Ministry over Karzai's appointment of a new minister from
the Pushtun ethnic group rather than the Tajiks ended peacefully
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The strike stopped after Karzai said publicly that it was both
unpatriotic and a firing offense to refuse to accept the appointee.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in the presidential palace the day before, as he
was putting the final touches on his Cabinet, Karzai talked
passionately about the difficult task ahead to end what is known in
this region as warlordism, and about his desire to create a working
central government. Wearing his trademark sheepskin cap and a gray
shalwar kameez--the traditional Afghan pants and shirt--he seemed
completely engaged in his effort to forge the nation's future.</TE>
<TE>   "I am planning to deliver to the Afghan people what they asked of
me. And they have asked of me, clearly, security all over the
country; clearly, an end to gunrunning and force against them;
clearly, an end to separate stretches of power in Afghanistan,"
Karzai said as he leaned back comfortably in an armchair set under a
mantelpiece made of white Afghan marble.</TE>
<TE>   "They want one authority, and that authority has to serve them,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   That will be no mean feat. Western diplomats say that Karzai had
to make difficult choices in the formation of his Cabinet and that he
has more difficult choices ahead if he is to bring the warlords to
heel.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, his only means of achieving his democratic goals are
force of personality and some limited political maneuvering. For
instance, if a warlord in a distant region refused to send customs
duties to Kabul, Karzai could threaten to take away his governorship,
but such threats have credibility only if they can be enforced.
Afghanistan has no army under central government control and only a
limited police force.</TE>
<TE>   "To do the job of controlling the warlords may eventually require
force, and at present that doesn't exist in the central government.
These are the limitations he has to work with," a Western diplomat
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Karzai seemed aware of these limitations but
sketched out ways of coping with the hand he has been dealt.</TE>
<TE>   His original plan--to bring all the powerful warlords into his
Cabinet in order to loosen their hold on the provinces--was
undermined when two of them declined his offer. Karzai ended up with
two of the leading warlords in and three out. In completing the
Cabinet on Saturday, he attempted to tie in most of the missing
warlords by including a son of Ismail Khan, the governor of Herat
province, as well as several close allies of Uzbek warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostum.</TE>
<TE>   Khan and Dostum turned down offers to join the Cabinet because
that would have meant giving up their regional roles, according to
sources close to Karzai. Khan, for his part, controls tariffs paid by
those who bring goods from Iran--which, according to some reports,
amount to more than $100,000 a day. Karzai said Khan has agreed to
send the revenues to Kabul, but it was unclear what his incentive
might be.</TE>
<TE>   The role of warlords in Afghanistan is a complex one. In a country
that in modern times has never had a strong central government, they
control men and resources alike in remote regions. Within their
fiefdoms, they enjoy an odd combination of opprobrium and admiration.
They are feared and hated because they resort to violence, but many
are also admired for their role as fighters against the Soviets when
the USSR occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   For Karzai, the warlords' separate armies foster an atmosphere of
instability and the constant specter of renewed fighting among
commanders from different regions and ethnic groups, which makes it
difficult for him to build a power base in Kabul. He seemed concerned
to repeatedly make clear that, although he is attempting to bring the
warlords to Kabul, he is not adopting their methods.</TE>
<TE>   "There cannot be separate armed groups--that's very, very
certain--and I will convey that in very certain terms: No private
armies around here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the warlords refuse to disband their militias, Karzai said, he
is prepared to "ask the international community" to intervene. But he
is hoping it will not come to that.</TE>
<TE>   "The sentiment in Afghanistan for nation building, for state
building, is strong. All of us see the demand of the Afghan
people.... People are sick and tired of chaos and warlordism," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As he knows, if he were forced to turn to the international
community, it is not entirely clear what kind of help it would give
him, because there would be a deep reluctance to fight with the
warlords.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, for one, has turned to many of these regional
commanders to help American soldiers carry out the war on terrorism,
paying them for their services.</TE>
<TE>   Over the long term, Western diplomats say, the solution for Karzai
is to build a national army. But that too is proving difficult. The
U.S. has undertaken to train the first battalions but has received
little help from Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim, a former top
commander in the Northern Alliance, the militia that toppled the
Taliban with U.S. support.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai appears to be trying to bring Fahim along in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Marshal Fahim yesterday," he said. "And I said, 'We have
two ways: We either build this country and this nation and go into
history as good people, or we don't do the right thing and the Afghan
nation will curse us as evil. Which one do you want to choose?' "</TE>
<TE>   Karzai does have one thing squarely on his side in the realm of
public perception: He has no army, so he is a clear break from the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "If I brought 5,000 people here, it would not help this country.
It would hurt it. I would rather be killed here by somebody than
bring my own army," he said.</TE>

<HD>Malaysian Premier Briefly Resigns</HD>

<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday offered, then
rapidly withdrew, his resignation from party and ruling coalition
posts in what the opposition called a political charade.</LD>
<LD>   Mahathir, 76, has led Malaysia for 21 years and has regained
popularity since losing ground to fundamentalists in 1999 elections.</LD>
<LD>   Mahathir was led weeping from the rostrum after announcing that he
was quitting all his posts in the National Front coalition and in his
party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, in a live
address on national television.</LD>
<TE>   Within an hour, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
returned to tell an audience of party faithful that the prime
minister had been persuaded to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Mahathir Mohamad is still our prime minister, is still UMNO
president, is still Barisan Nasional chairman and is still holding
other posts," Abdullah said, using the coalition's Malaysian name.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a desperate attempt to fish sympathy and votes,
and he may call for an election soon," said Hatta Ramli, an
opposition fundamentalist party official.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, Fadzil Nor, the leader of the fundamentalist
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, died today after failing to regain
consciousness following heart bypass surgery two weeks ago, hospital
officials said. He was 65.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said that Mahathir felt "all right" and would be going on
leave for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Mahathir never said specifically that he was quitting the
premiership, but officials said later that that was his intention.</TE>

<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>WELLINGTON, New Zealand --The Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand
said Saturday that it knew of 38 cases of sexual abuse by church
officers in the last 50 years and offered victims an "unreserved"
apology.</LD>
<LD>   In the Catholic Church's first admission of widespread sexual
abuse by church officers in New Zealand, officials said the cases
included complaints against priests and lay members in positions of
authority. The abused were children, teens and adults receiving care
from the church.</LD>
<LD>   In an open apology, Father Tim Duckworth of the Society of Mary,
New Zealand's largest order of priests, said the church's former
policy of moving known offenders to other parishes or schools, rather
than removing them from their duties, was a mistake.</LD>
<TE>   "I unreservedly apologize on behalf of brother priests and
religious [members of the church community] for the hurt that has
been done by some few of our number," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic communications director Lyndsay Freer said the repeat
nature of offenders was not understood in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The church ... has come to understand the need for openness and
transparency," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under new church policies, known pedophiles will be removed from
their duties and victims will be strongly recommended to take
criminal complaints to the police.</TE>

<HD>Australia Gets Tougher on Asylum Seekers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>In a case that has drawn international interest, an Afghan refugee
who has lived freely in Australia while his wife and five children
have been locked up for 18 months may soon join them in detention.</LD>
<LD>   The government is seeking to revoke the asylum status of Ali Asqar
Bakhtiari on the grounds that several unidentified witnesses and a
government-paid language analyst maintain he is from Pakistan, not
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The case of the Bakhtiari family, which is under review by a
United Nations human rights panel, has highlighted the arbitrary
nature of Australia's mandatory detention system. It is now before
the high court as a test of the government's authority to lock up all
asylum seekers who arrive without prior approval.</LD>
<TE>   It has also focused attention on the harsh conditions many
detainees endure at Australia's six detention centers, where
authorities send illegal immigrants until their cases are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "They have power, and they can do whatever they want," Bakhtiari
said in an interview. "But until the end of everything, I am from
Afghanistan and I am Afghan."</TE>
<TE>   Bakhtiari, who arrived in Australia in late 1999, was initially
detained but then freed in August 2000 and granted a three-year
protection visa after authorities accepted his account that he was an
Afghan farmer fleeing persecution by the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Roqia, and their five children landed in Australia later
and were denied asylum after officials concluded that she was not
telling the truth and that she was most likely from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   She and the children, now ages 5 through 14, have been
incarcerated at the Woomera detention center in the Australian
outback since their arrival Jan. 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ali and Roqia found out only last August that they were both in
Australia when a refugee who had been released from detention
encountered Ali in Sydney. Attorneys took up the Bakhtiaris' case and
appealed to Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to release Roqia and
the children on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruddock, who opposes reuniting family members who arrive
separately and without authorization, rejected the appeal. He also
declined to release the children to their father.</TE>
<TE>   Staff members at the detention center have expressed concern about
the deteriorating condition of the family, particularly the two boys.
The elder, 14-year-old Alamdar, carved the word "Freedom" into his
forearm with a razor blade.</TE>
<TE>   Australia has taken a tough stand against asylum seekers who began
arriving, mostly by boat, from Islamic countries such as Iraq and
Afghanistan in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Although Australia is bound by international treaty to grant
asylum to refugees who have a justified fear of persecution in their
homelands, the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard
has done all it can to keep them out.</TE>
<TE>   All asylum seekers who reach Australia without proper
documentation, including children, are locked up while their claims
are processed. Some have remained in custody for years.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian navy, aided by sophisticated surveillance aircraft,
has been deployed to intercept refugee boats in international waters
and take asylum seekers to detention centers on remote Pacific
islands.</TE>
<TE>   This approach has been condemned internationally but appears to be
working. No refugee boat has reached Australia since last August. The
last time one tried to make the crossing from Indonesia was in
December, when it was stopped by the navy and escorted back.</TE>
<TE>   The number of detainees in Australian detention centers has
declined to about 600 as some have been granted temporary asylum and
others have been deported. Most of those remaining either have been
refused asylum and are appealing the decisions or cannot be shipped
home because Australia has no deportation agreement with their
countries of origin, such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, United Nations officials who toured
Australia's detention centers said the asylum seekers are treated
worse than criminals because they are not told how long they will be
detained.</TE>
<TE>   "Collective depression" and the "agonizing uncertainty" of their
detention are prompting some to deliberately harm themselves and even
attempt suicide, said Louis Joinet, head of the U.N. Working Group on
Arbitrary Detention.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 1,400 asylum seekers remain in Australian-funded
detention centers in the Pacific island countries of Papua New Guinea
and Nauru, where they were taken by the navy last year. Activists say
the conditions there are as bad or worse than in the Australian
detention centers.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of the Taliban, nearly all of the Afghans' asylum
applications have been rejected. Australia has offered to pay the
Afghan detainees the equivalent of $1,000 per person or $5,000 per
family to return home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very generous offer," said Steve Ingram, Ruddock's
spokesman, noting that the minimum is more than the average Afghan
would earn in a year.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most of the eligible Afghans have turned down the money,
especially members of the ethnic Hazara minority, who say they still
fear persecution from Afghanistan's Pushtun majority.</TE>
<TE>   Officials rejected Roqia Bakhtiari's request for asylum last year
because they said she did not know enough about Afghanistan's
geography and currency to prove that the nation was her homeland.</TE>
<TE>   She continues to maintain that she is Afghan. In an interview this
year, she said she had trouble answering an official's questions
about her country because, as a woman, she had seldom left her home
and had little contact with anyone outside her family.</TE>
<TE>   After Ruddock refused to release Roqia and the children, her
attorneys appealed to the high court. A hearing is set for September.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the government began reexamining Ali Bakhtiari's
background.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the government notified him that it had located "several
sources" who said that they knew him in Pakistan and that he was a
plumber, not a farmer. The government has refused to identify the
witnesses or release their statements to Bakhtiari's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The government also sent a tape recording of his speech to an
agency in Europe that specializes in providing linguistic analysis to
governments in refugee cases. The agency concluded that his dialect
probably originated in Quetta, Pakistan. The government has declined
to identify the linguist or to release the report to Bakhtiari's
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no opportunity to question the linguist or see their
credentials," said Nicholas Poynder, a Sydney lawyer who is helping
the family.</TE>
<TE>   Poynder and his associates went to federal court to block the
revocation of Bakhtiari's protection visa.</TE>
<TE>   They obtained statements from two named witnesses who say they
knew Bakhtiari in Afghanistan. Bakhtiari says he can come up with 10
more witnesses if he needs to.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys also obtained an opinion from linguistic expert Jan
Mohammed, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, who
concluded that Bakhtiari's speech is consistent with that of someone
from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Psychological reports made public through the family's legal
appeals reveal that Roqia and the children are suffering from serious
depression at Woomera and that the two sons have deliberately cut
themselves on the arms and legs. Montazar, 12, threatened to kill
himself if the family was not released.</TE>
<TE>   Roqia has gone on a hunger strike and sewn her lips together to
protest their imprisonment. The boys' lips were also stitched shut,
and staff members charged that Roqia did it.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bakhtiaris stand out among other families I have worked with
at [Woomera] as they, and particularly Alamdar, display a definite
and visible steady downward decline in normal childhood behavior,"
youth worker Sharon Torbet wrote in a report this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since he left in 1999, Bakhtiari has seen his wife and children
only during two one-week visits to Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   He is fatalistic about their chances of staying in Australia and
is relying on an authority he believes is higher than the immigration
minister.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in God, and he is going to rescue me and solve my
problems," he said. "If God wants me to stay here, I will stay and
Phil Ruddock and the immigration department can't do anything about
it."</TE>

<DL>ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia</DL>
<LD>Flood waters swept away homes, washed out bridges and left at least
28 people dead and 20,000 homeless across southern Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Rescuers in helicopters plucked residents to safety, some from
trees to which they had clung. Other helicopters flew in food and
water for drivers stranded on the region's main highway.</LD>
<LD>   The victims included two rescue workers, one of whom drowned while
helping to evacuate a village in the Stavropol region, 750 miles
south of Moscow, news agencies reported.</LD>
<TE>   Buildings battered by flood waters collapsed, killing other people
from exposure to cold water or from heart attacks, said Lt. Col. Yuri
Kolodkin, duty officer at a special army flood relief headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin met with top ministers in the Kremlin
to discuss relief efforts for those left homeless by the raging
rivers, swollen after days of heavy rain. Damage has been estimated
at $106 million.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters carried out more than 50 evacuation flights in the
Stavropol region, in one case rescuing 50 children from a flooded
health center, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency Situations Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, who flew to the
region, said 6,000 people had been evacuated in the previous 24
hours, presidential press secretary Alexei Gromov told the Interfax
news agency.</TE>
<TE>   In the republic of North Ossetia, the regional emergency
situations minister, Boris Dzgoyev, said thousands of villagers were
trapped and were being evacuated by helicopters. He said 13 bridges
had been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The separatist republic of Chechnya also was badly hit, with
nearly all bridges over the Argun River swept away and many districts
cut off from aid.</TE>

<HD>Dramatic Change Needed to Halt AIDS, U.N. Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- A year after the 189-nation General Assembly
adopted a plan to halt the AIDS epidemic, a U.N. report issued today
said "dramatic changes" in sexual awareness and behavior are still
needed in many poor countries to stop the advance of the killer
disease.</LD>
<LD>   The report examined data from 39 countries in Africa, Asia and
Latin America and concluded that although campaigns have raised
awareness of HIV and AIDS in many developing countries, they have not
had a major impact on people's behavior--and their perception of
risk.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. Population Fund said about 5,000 households were surveyed
in each country, from the mid-to-late 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Even in countries where HIV rates are high, the report found that
a large majority of men and women considered themselves at little or
no risk of contracting AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "Also striking is the fact that in none of the countries surveyed
did the level of education make a significant difference in the
responses. This suggests that education has not been effective in
making people aware of their own susceptibility to AIDS," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that in some countries -- including Benin, Burkina
Faso, Chad, Mali, Madagascar and Niger -- about half the women
surveyed didn't know they could contract a disease through sexual
contact.</TE>
<TE>   Although AIDS campaigns have raised awareness in urban areas, the
report said, "existing programs have done little, so far, to
adequately inform the vast majority of couples who live in the rural
areas of many African and Asian countries."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Is Accused of Shredding Documents</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: A pension fund, which says it lost $116 million
in the Chapter 11 filing, is seeking an injunction to prevent the
loss of any more records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stacks of documents were destroyed at Global Crossing Ltd. in the
days before as well as after the telecommunications company filed for
bankruptcy protection and became a subject of federal investigations,
lawyers in a securities fraud case charge.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the Ohio State Retirement System, which says it lost
$116 million in stock when Global Crossing filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 28, are seeking
orders to halt further shredding and to copy information from all of
Global Crossing's computers.</LD>
<LD>   But company executives denied that any significant amounts of
documents were destroyed. The pension fund claims papers were
shredded in violation of Global's own Feb. 7 mandate to employees to
retain documents in light of the bankruptcy filing and investigations
into the company's accounting practices.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations are part of a series of declarations, depositions
and arguments filed under seal since June 10 and released Friday by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert E. Gerber in New York.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, both the company and the Ohio fund interviewed
current and former employees to try to determine if any documents
involving the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "While we have found isolated incidents of document disposal in
the ordinary course of business, none of the documents involved
appear to have any relevance to pending litigation or governmental
investigations," Global Crossing said in a statement. Executives said
that "there is no merit to the allegations and that they remain
largely unsubstantiated."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations came to light a week after a federal jury in
Houston convicted accounting firm Arthur Andersen of obstruction of
justice in a case that involved illegal disposal of documents related
to collapsed energy trader Enron Corp., which itself is under a court
order to halt document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio pension fund contends that on Jan. 22, six days before
the bankruptcy filing, employees shredded documents that filled three
garbage bags. On Feb. 7, Global Crossing sent a companywide e-mail
telling employees to halt any further shredding, as the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors began
investigating the company.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the pension fund contends, two employees--one the
son-in-law of top executive Joseph Perrone--went behind closed doors
in a storage room "where shredding appears to have taken place"
shortly after the company e-mail was distributed.</TE>
<TE>   The pension fund does not offer any evidence of the nature of the
shredded documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the court papers, Cathleen Kicak, a Global Crossing
receptionist, said she saw secretary Beth Hunt Drong and Perrone
relative Steve Scro leave a large storage room containing a shredder
at the company's Madison, N.J., offices. Kicak said she and her
co-workers "were curious as to why they were in there behind a closed
door with a shredder."</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old receptionist "heard the sound of a shredding
machine operating just before" the employees left the room,
shareholders' lawyers said in court papers. In her statement, Kicak
said they left the door open and she saw a small shredder sitting on
top of a garbage pail.</TE>
<TE>   Kicak said she later told her sister-in-law and then co-worker,
Danuta McLennan, about the shredding. McLennan, who left the company
in March, said she went to the room and, though the door was closed,
"heard what sounded like shredding machines in use."</TE>
<TE>   McLennan later informed lawyers for Global Crossing shareholders
about the alleged shredding. Drong and Scro denied shredding any
documents. Drong said in the court papers that she and Scro sometimes
ate lunch in the storage room to discuss company matters. She also
said that she never saw a shredder in that storage room and that all
shredders were removed from copy rooms within a week or so after the
Feb. 7 e-mail was sent.</TE>
<TE>   Pension fund lawyers claim that, according to McLennan's
statement, the shredding took place over 2 1/2 weeks and that a
"significant volume of documents" was destroyed. However, neither
Kicak nor McLennan claimed to have seen any shredding take place.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, an e-mail dated Feb. 15 indicated that Scro and Drong
told other employees they saw an aide to a former executive shred
documents that filled three garbage bags. The company said the
documents consisted of research materials of a former executive.
Global Crossing lawyers told Gerber that, besides sending the Feb. 7
e-mail, they moved quickly to safeguard more than 1 million documents
government regulators and investors' lawyers may be interested in.</TE>
<TE>   The Bermuda company listed $22.4 billion in assets--largely
fiber-optic cable networks linking about 200 cities in 27
countries--and $12.4 billion in debts. With a glut of cable worldwide
and slack demand, the company could not generate enough revenue amid
massive amounts of red ink to pay down its debts.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective buyers for all or parts of the company's assets are
expected to file bids by July 11, and an auction will be held two
weeks later. The court will decide July 30 if anything will be sold.
Executives and creditors believe current managers can salvage Global
and keep it as an independent telecommunications company.</TE>

<KH>ANN LANDERS: 1918-2002</KH>
<HD>Advice Columnist Known for Her Wit and Wisdom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ann Landers, whose newspaper column dispensed advice to millions of
Americans on everything from adultery to adult bedwetting, from
parental difficulties to pet adoption, died Saturday in Chicago. She
was 83.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone
marrow, her family said.</LD>
<LD>   Landers, whose real name was Eppie Lederer, was one of the world's
most widely read columnists. For 46 years, she offered compassionate
and blunt counsel to lonely wives, philandering husbands and
frustrated teenagers, among others. Her columns chronicled the
nation's attitudes, preoccupations and worries for more than 90
million readers.</LD>
<TE>   She expressed support for a woman's right to abortion and
acceptance of homosexuality but also preached the importance of the
traditional family. In shaping her advice, she consulted outside
experts including U.S. Supreme Court justices and a Mayo Clinic
physician, and she often referred readers to counselors and
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer, who also wrote six books, regularly appeared in rankings
of the nation's most influential women.</TE>
<TE>   She often read her letters--some of them stained with coffee and
bourbon--in a bathtub in her 11-room apartment on Chicago's Lake
Shore Drive with dramatic views of Lake Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "I look for letters that teach something. Or that people can
relate to. Or that are very offbeat," she once said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was like America's mother," her daughter, Margo Howard of
Cambridge, Mass., told the Chicago Tribune, "and I'm not alone in my
sadness.</TE>
<TE>   "She was about fixing the world," said Howard, who writes an
advice column of her own, "Dear Prudence," for the online magazine
Slate. "She really wanted to make things better. She really cared
about people."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer was born to Russian immigrant parents in Sioux City, Iowa,
on July 4, 1918. Her identical twin, Pauline Esther Friedman
Phillips, also became an advice columnst--known as Abigail Van Buren,
or "Dear Abby."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer enrolled in Morningside College in Sioux City and dropped
out during her senior year. At age 21, the twin sisters were married
in matching gowns on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   For the first 16 years of her marriage to Jules William Lederer, a
founder of Budget Rent-A-Car, she was a homemaker, a volunteer with
the Democratic Party and active in civic affairs.</TE>
<TE>   When the couple lived in Wisconsin, her volunteer work got her
elected head of the Eau Claire County Democratic Party. The couple
and their teenage daughter, Margo, moved to Chicago in 1955. On a
train from Wisconsin, she met and talked at length with an executive
at the Chicago Sun-Times.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, she was one of 30 people invited to apply to take over
the Sun-Times' Ann Landers column after its creator died.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer, the only candidate who was not a professional writer, was
given five sample letters and asked to write responses. One of the
letters was from a homeowner who wondered what legal rights he had to
walnuts falling into his yard from a tree on a neighbor's property.</TE>
<TE>   She called Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, whom she knew
from her civic activities. Douglas told her the neighbor could do
anything with the walnuts except sell them. Lederer quoted the
justice in her tryout column, along with a Mayo Clinic doctor she had
consulted about a medical question.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer later recalled that when she submitted her work to
Sun-Times Managing Editor Larry Fanning, "He told me, 'You can't just
make up these quotes.' I said, 'I didn't.' And he said, 'OK, then,
you're hired.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her first column was published Oct. 16, 1955, in 26 papers. By
1993, Ann Landers appeared in 1,200 newspapers worldwide, including
the Los Angeles Times. She worked at the Sun-Times until 1987, when
she switched syndication companies and moved to the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   In offering advice to "Anxious in Akron" or "Wrong Side of the
Tracks in New York," Lederer was both brash and compassionate as she
advised sexless singles, harried husbands, nosy neighbors and
teenagers with drinking problems, among others.</TE>
<TE>   She received 2,000 letters a day. A staff of seven culled 500 of
those for examination by Landers. She wrote her columns on an IBM
electric typewriter because she hated computers. She hoarded
typewriter ribbons against the day when they were no longer sold.</TE>
<TE>   Her advice was snappy and to-the-point:</TE>
<TE>   "An unwilling groom makes a poor husband."</TE>
<TE>   "A father who diapers his daughter until the age of 12 has a
geranium in his cranium."</TE>
<TE>   Masturbation, she once wrote, "is a normal part of growing up."</TE>
<TE>   Replying to a teacher in Mississippi, she used cows to explain
communism. "You have two cows. Give both cows to the government, and
they may give you some of the milk."</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, she advised the lonely, sick and bereaved to "get a
pet."</TE>
<TE>   Readers' letters and Lederer's advice changed with the times.
David Grossvogel, a Cornell University professor, did a computer
analysis of 10,000 Ann Landers columns for his 1986 book, "Dear Ann
Landers: Our Intimate and Changing Dialogue with America's Best-Loved
Confidante."</TE>
<TE>   Using word searches, Grossvogel tracked changes in topics,
starting with "sex," which was virtually nonexistent in the early
columns. Later, it came to dominate the column, along with frank
advice about masturbation, penile implants and homosexuality, topics
editors would have deleted if she'd mentioned them 30 years before.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Grossvogel reported, Landers readers became much
less concerned with matters of appearance and acceptance and more
often sought advice about smoking, drinking, drugs and sexual
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Her work was not free of controversy. In 1982, it was revealed
that she had recycled material in her columns. In 1995, in an
interview with the New Yorker magazine, she referred to Pope John
Paul II as a "polack." She later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   She did not shy from revealing details of her personal life to her
readers. News that the popular columnist and her husband were
planning to divorce after 36 years of marriage created a stir in
1975. Landers announced the decision in what she said was "the most
difficult column I have ever tried to put together.</TE>
<TE>   "How did it happen that something so good didn't last forever? The
lady with all the answers does not know the answer to this one."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer never remarried, but spoke of a relationship with a
prominent Washington lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer's relations with her twin sister, who lives in Beverly
Hills, were strained for a time. Soon after Lederer began her column,
her sister began writing "Dear Abby" for the San Francisco Chronicle.
It, too, became a huge success.</TE>
<TE>   This led to a rivalry and an estrangement between the sisters
that, by some accounts, lasted seven years. Lederer then sought a
reconciliation, and the two renewed their close friendship.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview marking her column's 30th anniversary, Lederer
said: "I learned early in this work to take the problems seriously
but not to take them too personally. I have to separate myself from
the readers and realize what's happening to them is not happening to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer owned rights to the name Ann Landers and said that the
column would die when she did.</TE>
<TE>   "That name is worth at least a million dollars. I've been offered
that, but it's important to me that the name be connected to me--and
nobody else," she said in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   As of Saturday, it was not known whether the columns Lederer had
already written would be published.</TE>
<TE>   Lederer served as a board member, trustee or committee member for
many of the nation's most prestigious educational and medical
institutions, including the Harvard Medical School, the Yale
Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   She received honorary degrees from dozens of colleges and
universities. In 1985, she was the first journalist to receive the
Albert Lasker Public Service Award for lobbying Congress to approve
millions of dollars for cancer research and referring her readers to
a wide variety of health-care agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, she is survived by three
grandchildren, four great-grandhcildren and her sister.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune news services contributed to this report. The Ann Landers
column that appears on Page E4 in today's Southern California Living
section went to press before her death.</TE>

<HD>Crowded ERs Put Patients on Hold</HD>
<DH>L.A. County: Paramedics say long waits, which can stretch
up to five hours, endanger lives. Officials contend the critically
ill are seen immediately.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overcrowding in Los Angeles County emergency rooms is forcing
patients brought by ambulance to wait up to five hours in hospital
hallways and lobbies, cared for by paramedics rather than doctors or
nurses.</LD>
<LD>   Paramedics and ambulance workers with six months or less of formal
training often are the only ones watching over patients who are
seriously ill or even dying--a task many say is far beyond their
ability.</LD>
<LD>   "People call 911 and they think if we bring them in, they'll get
seen by the doctor faster," said Los Angeles Fire Department
paramedic Orville Wright, who waited more than two hours last week
with a respiratory patient at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical
Center. "That's not the case."</LD>
<TE>   Hospital officials say the most critically ill patients are
treated immediately. But paramedics and some emergency physicians say
the congestion is endangering patients' lives.</TE>
<TE>   The danger extends beyond the ER. While paramedics are waiting for
a bed to open up in the emergency room, ambulance responses are often
delayed in the communities they cover. If an ambulance is taken out
of commission, response times in its service area increase by four to
five minutes on average, fire officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulance backups are worsening because more patients are seeking
emergency-room care, even as hospitals are closing ERs. In the last
decade, more than 20 ERs have shut down in Los Angeles County,
narrowing treatment options in a sprawling region of 9.6 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   The waits are longest in downtown Los Angeles, South Los Angeles
and the Antelope Valley. Among recent examples:</TE>
<TE>   * Two patients have died since December while waiting with
paramedics at Good Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles. In
response, Dr. Marc Eckstein, medical director of the Los Angeles Fire
Department, sent a letter expressing "grave concern" to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains the legal and moral responsibility of the hospital to
provide care for the patient once he is on the hospital premises," he
wrote. "Patients in need of urgent interventions must receive them,
regardless of whose gurney they are located on."</TE>
<TE>   A county investigation did not find that the deaths were caused by
the waits, which Eckstein estimated at 30 minutes in both cases.</TE>
<TE>   * On the night of Feb. 15, between eight and 12 ambulances were
parked outside Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster. Inside,
paramedics and patients waited for hours because the 28-bed emergency
room was full. The delays left the valley of 318,000 people virtually
uncovered by ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   * Several times lately in the Antelope Valley, paramedics waiting
at hospitals have sought permission via radio from supervisors 70
miles away to administer intravenous medications to patients. That
was because they could not get the attention of a doctor or nurse
just yards away.</TE>
<TE>   * Last Monday, five ambulance crews were stuck simultaneously at
King/Drew in Willowbrook.</TE>
<TE>   Wright's ambulance, transporting a 42-year-old woman with
difficulty breathing, was sidelined for 2 hours and 19 minutes in the
early evening, when ambulances tend to be busiest. Hooked to a
portable oxygen tank, the woman also showed signs of liver problems
and anemia. A week earlier, Wright said, he had waited three hours
with a homeless man injured in a fall. The man finally gave up, got
off the gurney and left.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles city ambulance squads reported themselves out of
service about 22,000 times last year because they had to wait for an
open bed longer than the 15 minutes allotted by the Fire Department,
Eckstein said. In those cases, squads waited an average of 30 to 35
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The delays affected one in every seven patients transported by
city ambulance. It's as if two ambulances were out of service each
day, Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "The paramedics by default become ER nurses or part of the
hospitals' staff," said Eckstein, who is also an ER doctor at
County-USC Medical Center in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Some medics are so sure they will face delays that they bring
crossword puzzles, books and folding chairs. They have dubbed the
collections "NAV kits," which stands for "not available."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we need a little gallows humor," said fire Capt. Marc
Segal, one of the city's emergency medical services supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the county's most overcrowded hospitals say that
patients in critical condition--bleeding uncontrollably or not
breathing--are seen immediately by a doctor or nurse. And most
patients receive at least a quick once-over by a triage nurse within
the first half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any hospital in Los Angeles County will have a
problem defending what it is doing," said Jim Lott, executive vice
president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern California, a hospital
trade group. "It is treating patients as fast as it can."</TE>
<TE>   Health experts attribute the problem largely to a critical nursing
shortage, which leaves ERs and intensive-care units understaffed; too
few inpatient beds, which delays transfers out of the ER; and low
payments for emergency and trauma care, which has forced some ERs to
close. One ER shut in Pasadena this year and another will close in
Marina del Rey by August.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, Los Angeles County officials will consider
shutting ERs at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar and
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance to close a massive
health-care budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   All county residents are at risk, officials say. "When you have
these long waits, it delays the response to the next incoming call,
which could be from the mayor of Los Angeles, for all we know, or a
street person," said Virginia Hastings, head of the county emergency
medical services agency. "This EMS system serves all 10 million
people, not just those without insurance."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Los Angeles County and other regions have allowed
hospitals, when full, to temporarily close their ERs to ambulances.
Ambulances then are diverted to other hospitals close by. But when
every hospital in an area is full, even temporarily closed ERs must
accept patients. That's when ambulances stack up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you need a medical degree to know that this is not
the way it should be," said Dr. Brian Johnston, an ER physician at
White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles. "Throughout the area,
waiting times have gone from frustrating to dangerous.... If this
continues, people will die."</TE>
<TE>   Battalion Chief Michael Metro, EMS director for the county Fire
Department, said he can pinpoint the exact date--March 19, 2001--when
he became alarmed about such ambulance backups. On that day, one of
his squads waited 3 hours and 55 minutes with a patient at Lancaster
Community Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "That is just an absolutely extraordinary amount of time," Metro
said. "When that occurred, we said, 'My God, we've got to get the
players together.' "</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County appears to have one of the worst
ambulance-gridlock problems in the nation. Although ambulances
elsewhere must often travel long distances to find open hospitals,
only a few other cities--including Las Vegas and Albuquerque--also
have long waits for paramedics once they arrive at the ER.</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, some hospitals have stationed extra paramedics to
wait with ambulance patients in emergency rooms so that transporting
squads can return to the streets. Paramedics at the Las Vegas Fire
Department also offer to take patients to a second hospital if they
are told to wait at the first one. That does not happen in Los
Angeles County because officials here believe it would put hospitals
at risk of violating federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires hospitals to examine and stabilize, if necessary,
any patient who arrives on their grounds. Technically, paramedics
could drop off patients and leave. But, in Los Angeles County, their
superiors tell them not to, both for ethical reasons and because they
would risk being sued by patients who suffer harm.</TE>
<TE>   The county sets rules for the 31 fire departments, more than 15
private ambulance companies and more than 80 ERs that make up its
emergency response system.</TE>
<TE>   One of those rules limits the flexibility of ambulance squads by
requiring them to deliver patients from certain areas to specific
hospitals. At times, this keeps paramedics from considering
less-crowded alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   As waits worsen, government officials and hospitals are looking
hard for solutions.</TE>
<TE>   The city Fire Department is considering software upgrades so that
paramedics can see on their laptops how many rescue ambulances are
waiting at each hospital.</TE>
<TE>   If two or more ambulances are waiting--or one ambulance has waited
longer than an hour--paramedics would be advised to go somewhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is to allow one medic crew to watch over
several ambulance patients, allowing others to return to service. Or,
the city could continue to add ambulances: In the coming year, the
Fire Department will increase the number on hand to 117, from 83 in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the Antelope Valley, the county Fire Department has equipped
two more of its engines to handle paramedic calls. The two hospitals
with ERs have added staff and pledged to triage patients more
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley Hospital officials say the wait times there have
decreased since the winter. But the underlying problem remains: The
region had fewer inpatient beds in 2000 than in 1990, even though the
population grew by 27%.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, Hastings said, "I'm not sure that there's one easy
answer to all this."</TE>
<TE>   Segal, the Los Angeles EMS supervisor, is trying to solve one
crisis at a time. This past week, fire dispatchers asked him to visit
King/Drew and ease the backup there.</TE>
<TE>   As Segal walked through the emergency room, he found that every
bed was taken, and overflow patients with IVs and oxygen tubes were
sitting in wheelchairs and desk chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Segal managed to free one ambulance before leaving. It was called
into action one minute later.</TE>
<TE>   Four other squads were left in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty to the citizens here," Segal said of the waiting
times. "They should have candy stripers or volunteers or techs
scouring that hospital for gurneys."</TE>
<TE>   King/Drew officials say they are packed beyond their limit. Their
emergency room has an official capacity of 33 beds, but they
routinely handle 40 to 50 patients at any given time, borrowing beds
from other parts of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital expects to relieve some of the overcrowding by buying
additional computerized monitors that will allow some ER patients to
be moved more quickly to regular beds upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   But what King/Drew really needs is nurses, said Dr. Eugene Hardin,
chairman of the emergency medicine department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to keep nurses in the county, because we overwork
them," he said. "And once we do that, they ... just leave. It's hard
to blame them."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor is that patients believe they will be seen more
quickly if they summon an ambulance, whether or not their conditions
are urgent.</TE>
<TE>   For liability and other reasons, paramedics and emergency medical
technicians do not turn away non-urgent patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospitals are trying to curb unwarranted ambulance calls by
asking patients with minor illnesses to get off ambulance gurneys and
sit in the waiting room with walk-in patients.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials say patients who come to the ER on their own
can be as sick, or sicker, than patients brought in by paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say to somebody with chest pain who's lying in my
stretcher, 'I'm sorry, you have to get up because I have a paramedic
here who's bringing somebody in by ambulance,' " said Dr. Philip
Fagan Jr., emergency room medical director at Good Samaritan.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics sometimes feel, though, that overwhelmed hospital staff
members aren't taking heed when they should.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein wrote Good Samaritan in February to express his concerns
about the two patients who died after waiting for emergency beds. The
first, a young man complaining of chest pain, died Dec. 15; the
second, an elderly woman suffering signs of shock from internal blood
loss, died Feb. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the first patient, Eckstein wrote: "Our paramedics
reportedly told the [department] staff that this patient's vital
signs were worsening, but were allegedly met with some indifference."</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, both paramedics were extremely concerned that this
young patient, who was talking with them in the field, died after
waiting for 30 minutes on their stretcher in your [department]
without receiving care until he went into cardiac arrest."</TE>
<TE>   The second patient also went into cardiac arrest after 30 minutes,
and resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful, Eckstein wrote in the
letter, which was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The county Department of Health Services found no link between the
delays and the deaths, citing incomplete records and conflicting
accounts from paramedics and hospital staff members.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan's emergency room medical director, Fagan, said the
hospital handled the cases appropriately. "Everything was done that
could have been done within the capacities that we have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that someone dies does not necessarily mean that it's
the fault of the people involved."</TE>

<LD>A sinkhole gobbled up part of the driveway of a firehouse in
Zellwood, cracking the walls and causing a five-member firefighting
crew to relocate.</LD>
<LD>   The sinkhole, confined to a 30- by 60-foot area that included an
area where firetrucks parked, had only begun to collapse a few
inches. But walls of the 50-year-old fire station, about 15 miles
northeast of Orlando, started cracking Friday. It was the third
sinkhole in a month to form in central Florida.</LD>

<HD>Bush Trots Out His Healthier Government</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He didn't finish first, second or even in the top 20, but President
Bush tried to lead by example Saturday in a three-mile run with
hundreds of White House workers.</LD>
<LD>   His goal was to convince Americans to take to heart his message
that regular exercise is essential to the good health of the person
and the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, 55, came in near the top of the 400-runner field, finishing
26th under a hot morning sun.</LD>
<TE>   The president, running in blue shorts and a white T-shirt with
"Healthier U.S. government" on his back and a No. 1 tag on his chest,
posted an official time of 20 minutes, 29 seconds, as recorded by a
chip in his running shoe.</TE>
<TE>   A conventional race clock caught him at 20:27--with mile splits of
6:30, 6:49 and 7:08. Either way, he was just under his typical time
of 20:30 for three miles.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great. It was less than 20:30," a sweat-soaked Bush said
after finishing the course, which was two laps-plus around the parade
ground at the Army's Ft. McNair in southwest Washington. Philip
Mattson, 26, of the White House correspondence office, finished first
at 17:12.</TE>
<TE>   First Lady Laura Bush led a large group of walkers over a one-mile
course, finishing in 22:58.</TE>
<TE>   The entry fee for the executive mansion employees to run the race
was a pledge to devote several hours of time to volunteer work. Bush
told the staff he was serious about collecting it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for those of us in the White House to live how we
talk," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to say we're going to live a healthy life, let's
do it. If we say we care about a neighbor in need, if we want to love
a neighbor like we'd like to be loved ourselves, let's show it
through our actions. I hope you understand that at least that's how
the boss thinks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To Americans generally, he said: "I know you're a better worker if
you exercise on a daily basis. I know you'll help keep the
health-care costs down in America if you exercise on a daily basis. I
know your life will be more complete if you exercise and serve a
neighbor in need."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's own routine includes a run on Sundays when he clocks his
three miles. On Thursdays, he routinely runs about four miles,
averaging about seven minutes per mile.</TE>
<TE>   Bush underscored the fitness theme in his weekly radio address
Saturday, saying every participant in the Ft. McNair race "took
important steps on the road to better health."</TE>
<TE>   "And the good news is this: When it comes to your health, even
little steps can make a big difference," Bush said. "If just 10% of
adults began walking regularly, Americans could save $5.6 billion in
costs related to heart disease. And research suggests we can reduce
cancer deaths by one-third simply by changing our diets and getting
more exercise."</TE>
<TE>   Just before he left Ft. McNair, the president watched as Sgt. 1st
Class Mark Fortinberry, 32, based at Ft. Knox, Ky., stormed a 35-foot
climbing wall and reached the top in seconds.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter asked Fortinberry if he had been tempted to stop to
catch his breath.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's the commander in chief watching," he said, "you can't
stop."</TE>

<HD>Drought Drives Ranchers on Trail to Last Roundup</HD>
<DH>Livestock: They're selling off their cattle. A
generations-old way of life is ending for some.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JUNTA, Colo.</DL>
<LD>With no snow last winter, and no rain last spring, there is no grass
this summer. With no grass there is no choice. They must bring their
herds here, to this stop on the old Santa Fe Trail, this crossroads
of the ancient trading routes, and sell.</LD>
<LD>   They arrive almost every morning, their sad caravans pulling up to
the two sale barns on the edge of town. They sort their cattle into
pens, then arrange themselves in bleachers around the dirt ring,
trying to maintain their composure while they watch the hard work of
a lifetime go to the highest bidder.</LD>
<LD>   It's more than just another dry season for the 16,000 cattle
ranchers of Colorado, proud men who have been running cattle on this
vast grassland since their grandfathers first taught them the
difference between a calf and a yearling. As the West swelters
through a once-in-a-lifetime drought, as the soil turns the driest
it's been since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, ranchers are forced to
cut back or fold up spreads that have been in their families for
generations.</LD>
<TE>   Some weep. Others hold the frozen smiles of men losing at poker.
No matter what face they show the world, however, every herd being
broken up means a cattleman's heart is being broken, and everyone in
the sale barns knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know a single buyer," says John Campbell, manager of one
sale barn, "who hasn't expressed concern and compassion for these
sellers."</TE>
<TE>   Outside one barn last week, a Kansas woman whose husband had come
to buy cattle met a Colorado man who had come to sell. They stood,
visiting, and the man told the woman about his troubles--dry weather,
hungry livestock. She shoved her fists into the pockets of her long
skirt.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a shame," she said. "A real shame."</TE>
<TE>   He looked at her, his face wracked with worry, and they walked
together like old partners into the barn.</TE>
<TE>   Herd liquidations are happening elsewhere in the drought-stricken
West, but the ranchers of Colorado consider La Junta the epicenter.
Even under normal circumstances, they say, La Junta is the nation's
second-busiest cattle market, after Oklahoma City. But suddenly the
steady flow of summer sales has turned into a stampede.</TE>
<TE>   La Junta and cattle have always gone together, like hamburger and
ketchup, since the days when driving a herd through downtown didn't
involve a trailer. And the two sale barns in La Junta have always
been sanctuaries for ranchers, places for talking shop and
socializing after weeks of speaking with no one but their cows. The
air is warm and moist with the smell of dung. The walls and floors
are specked with flies and spit and cigarette butts and sunflower
seeds. The auctioneers and ring men exchange sly winks with the
buyers and silly jokes with the sellers, and it's all a bit of
fraternity and fun for loners who rarely go a day without breaking a
sweat.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, however, the barns have become somber playhouses,
their rings the stages for one-act tragedies about the ravages of
drought.</TE>
<TE>   "A rancher and his cattle--it's like a romance," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   And when the romance ends, the lowing of the cows can sound like
weeping violins.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical June day last year, a sale barn in La Junta would
auction about 1,700 head of cattle. This summer the barns are working
three times that fast, and one day last week the number of cattle
sold hit 6,000. The sell-off has become so frenzied, both barns are
adding extra days to their schedules, with some auctions going around
the clock.</TE>
<TE>   One buyer from Missouri, who didn't want to give his name, came to
La Junta last month with the intention of staying two days. When he
saw the quality and abundance of cattle coming into the barns, he
stayed six weeks, filling $4.5 million worth of orders from various
clients. By Wednesday the man had shipped 142 semis full of cattle
back East, and he wasn't done.</TE>
<TE>   Before the summer is over, two-thirds of Colorado's 3.3 million
head of cattle will be sold or shipped elsewhere to graze, said Chuck
Hanagan, executive director of the local Farm Service Agency. The
immediate loss to ranchers will be $420 million, he estimated. But
the long-term effect on the region, and on a way of life as old as
the West, is impossible to gauge.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are selling their livelihood," Hanagan said. "It would
be like a carpenter selling his tools."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Rains was just one of the ranchers selling off last week. He
came to town early from his spread just south, parked his pickup in
the lot and walked slowly past the pens, where his herd was being
sorted. Bulls this way, cows and calves that way.</TE>
<TE>   He entered the barn, which was already packed with buyers from
Missouri, Kentucky, Minnesota and other rain-soaked states where the
ground has been blessed with a velvety layer of grass. A few men
stared in sympathy. Rains acknowledged their stares from deep under
the brim of his white cowboy hat.</TE>
<TE>   He looked tired.</TE>
<TE>   "Only slept a little last night," he said, spitting the words out
like sunflower seeds.</TE>
<TE>   He took a seat in the second row, beside Paul and Gayle
Taramarcaz, who also hadn't gotten much sleep. They drove 160 head
from Gunnison the night before and slept in a downtown motel. They
weren't selling off completely, like Rains, but they were drastically
cutting the size of their herd, and they too were holding themselves
tight.</TE>
<TE>   "Makes you want to cry," Gayle said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather let them go," Paul said, "than let them go hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Riding around the ranch these days, Paul sees things he hasn't
seen in his 70 years. Creek beds that have always sparkled with
mountain runoff--dry. Irrigation ditches that have never been without
moisture--dry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty sad when you see them out there with nothing to drink
or eat," he said of his cows. "It hurts you."</TE>
<TE>   The pain will come in waves. Nearly a third of the cows being sold
are carrying calves, Hanagan said, "so those calves won't be hauled
to the feedlots this fall." The feedlots will feel the pinch first,
along with their suppliers. Then the trucking companies that would
have hauled the calves to the feedlots will feel it, followed by the
service stations that would have pumped gas for those trucks, and the
restaurants that would have fed the drivers, and the farms that
supply the restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of pride. A rancher spends a lifetime
cultivating his herd. Some ranchers trace an animal's lineage on a
line parallel with their own.</TE>
<TE>   "They can tell you if a cow is a sixth-, seventh-,
eighth-generation heifer," Hanagan said. "Forty years ago that
rancher branded that cow's great-great-great-great-grandmother. He
can remember when his grandfather went back to Missouri to pick up
the bulls who sired that bloodline."</TE>
<TE>   Now, forced to sell that cow before it's calved, the rancher loses
not just his inheritance but also part of his heritage.</TE>
<TE>   For some, it's like losing a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a cow here today," Paul Taramarcaz said. "An old milking
cow, name of Old Ellie, I've had her for years."</TE>
<TE>   Gayle gasped.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no!" she said. "Not Old Ellie!"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said, looking guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know you brought Old Ellie."</TE>
<TE>   He nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooh," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They turned away from each other and faced the ring, where Old
Ellie would eventually come through a gate, and the bidding would
start at around $400.</TE>
<TE>   Paul is a quiet man, Gayle said, so it's hard to tell when he's
being quiet for a special reason. But this morning she could tell he
was different. No jokes. No smart remarks. He just stared, hard.</TE>
<TE>   Across the barn, staring back, was 72-year-old Hans Hansen. He
came to La Junta neither to buy nor sell, just to watch, and to hope
he wasn't seeing a preview of his own fate. "I'm just trying to
decide if I can hold on," Hansen said, "or if I'll have to pull the
plug."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his fate, everything about Hansen seemed determined by the
arid country. His eyes were blue as a cloudless sky. His wrinkles
looked like dry riverbeds. Even his voice rumbled like far-off
thunder as he acknowledged his debt to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how much we live with the weather," he said. "It
calls all the shots."</TE>
<TE>   Though the land seems to fight him and resist his love, Hansen
clings to it with a vise grip. He seldom strays far from home. He
sleeps in the room where he was born and hasn't spent a night in a
different bed for five years.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance he might seem like the rancher emeritus around
here, the white-haired elder, but soon it becomes clear that Hansen's
no different from the others, just a more sharply drawn version of
the archetype. All the ranchers in the barn are branded by their
sameness. They all wear white hats. They all drive trucks. They all
say as much as a novel with just a nod.</TE>
<TE>   And they all take a fierce pride in their connection to the past,
to the first ranchers who ran cattle across the grassland. They
derive confidence from their link to those pioneers, who came through
disease and dust and every other disaster, and never said die.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the skies don't open up soon, Hansen said, you have to
wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot have already pulled the plug," he said. "They had to get
jobs in town."</TE>
<TE>   He pronounced this fate as though it were far worse than death.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief pause for a change of auctioneers, it was time at
last for Rains' cattle to be sold.</TE>
<TE>   "These are 4-year-old Angus bulls," the new auctioneer bellowed,
as the first animals came into the ring with Rains' brand on their
backsides--a lazy TH over a bar. "These are from Floyd Rains' place
out south, and I imagine they're only being sold because it's dried
up out there."</TE>
<TE>   Rains' bulls ran around the ring, staring, their eyes nearly as
sad as Rains'. There was a flurry of bids, then the auctioneer
murmured, "Sold." The bulls were shooed through a gate on the right,
after fetching nearly $670 a head.</TE>
<TE>   "Less than I paid for them," Rains grumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Next came his cows, "all with calves in them," the auctioneer
promised.</TE>
<TE>   When the last Rains cattle were sold, ranchers came ambling over,
one by one, to pat Rains on the shoulder or simply tip their hats.
One man put his boot on the bleacher and leaned forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," the man said, smiling, "you won't have to feed them now."</TE>
<TE>   "No," Rains said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Then they both stopped smiling, and Rains dropped his voice an
octave.</TE>
<TE>   "I just couldn't hack it anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To which his friend could only nod.</TE>

<LD>   A dozen or more cars lined up at a roadblock here Saturday morning
for a chance to briefly visit their past lives--before the
137,000-acre wildfire drove them from their homes more than a week
ago, before home became a cot in a shelter, a tent in a neighbor's
yard, an air mattress on a friend's living room floor.</LD>
<TE>   Residents of the wooded creek subdivisions north of here were
given 10 minutes, and no more, to drive up the closed road to their
homes, see if they were still there, and gather what they needed
before leaving again.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten minutes goes by real fast," said Cindy Swager, who waited
nearly an hour in line before driving in with her husband. "We had a
list made out of the things we wanted to get so we wouldn't forget
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Hayman fire, the biggest in Colorado history, entered a
nerve-rattling period of uncertainty over the weekend, as the calm,
moist conditions of the last few days once again gave way to warm,
dry winds--the most dangerous kind of fire weather, with the
potential to whip flames over miles of fire lines laid by
firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be totally surprised if we don't lose it someplace," fire
information officer Bobby Kitchens said early in the day. "As you can
tell, I'm pretty tense. The test is coming. It's practically here....
The predictions were for winds of 35 miles an hour. Well, the winds
outside are already 40 miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   For the 7,900 residents evacuated from communities on the fringes
of the blaze, the weather forecasts meant scant hope of returning
home any time soon. Most emergency officials said it would be at
least Monday before any substantial areas were reopened for residents
to return. About 800 have returned so far.</TE>
<TE>   At the high school in Woodland Park on Friday night, county
officials were reading lists of streets touched by fire and asking
residents who lived on those streets to accompany them to a small,
private room outside the gym. There, they shared photographs of
burned homes in a process strangely reminiscent of the rooms at
airports where relatives of dead passengers are ushered. Counselors
were present. Some left the room in tears, huddled on the shoulder of
a friend. Most left with long, quiet gazes straight ahead, not having
anything to say.</TE>
<TE>   For most of those lined up at the Florissant Grange Hall, there
was the reassurance of knowing the fire was still at least two miles
from their homes, possibly farther.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several expressed a similar sentiment: In a region already
reeling with loss and peril, they wanted to see for themselves, to
lay eyes on their own house, see it still standing there in the
trees--if only for 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "How much can you get out in 10 minutes?" asked Lance Roberson, a
National Park Service employee who still had $40,000 worth of classic
cars--Mustangs, Fairlanes, Cyclones and Cougars--in a garage near his
house, uninsured and vulnerable. Roberson was able to move out only
about half of his 18-car collection when the evacuation order came
down last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten minutes is a crock, quite frankly," he said. "I don't see how
they can keep you off your own land. The whole thing doesn't make
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Al Dreher, a retired trucker who has lived in the Indian Creek
area for 20 years, was determined to water his potted plants, and it
was going to take longer than 10 minutes. He said the deputy waiting
outside his door to escort him out again better not try to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get them watered, no matter how much time it takes,"
he declared. "I've got a lot of time and money invested in them, and
I'm not going to lose them just because of 10 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Swager and her husband had their list. The bentwood rocking chair
their children had painstakingly restored for them, some photographs,
the Vita-Mix blender. "It's like the Rolls-Royce of blenders," Jack
Swager explained.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the list: doing something with the turkey they had left
defrosting in the kitchen. "It went out the door," Swager said.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents of the Indian Creek neighborhood had no time to
plan their flight 11 days ago. Many said they went to work in the
morning only to receive urgent phone calls from friends and relatives
later in the day that the area was being evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, they were coming with loudspeakers down the
road, they were saying, 'Get out now!' " Cindy Swager said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken and Delores Bradford took the most important items the day
they left: family photos and their John Wayne videos. Now they wanted
to get a few more items, but mostly, Delores Bradford said, they
wanted to see the house, to make sure it still was there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so excited to go in," she said, laughing nervously as they
crept up in the line of cars.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes later, on the way out, she was crying. No, she said,
the house was fine. It wasn't that. "Even though we know it's safe,
it was hard to leave," she said. "I don't know why. It's a mess!
Because I've dumped everything all over the floor trying to find what
we need." She raised her hands in a gesture of helplessness.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care. I'll be happy to clean it up."</TE>

<HD>Fla. in Hot Water Over 6 Girls in State Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Six girls in state custody were unsupervised at night and partied
with adult men at the hotel where they lived while awaiting foster
care, according to a police report.</LD>
<LD>   The girls, ages 11 to 15, were removed from the Marriott Residence
Inn on June 3, when hotel workers called police. The girls had lived
at the hotel since May 13.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Children &amp; Families is investigating, district
administrator David May told the Palm Beach Post.</LD>
<TE>   May said the girls were supervised by Maxim Healthcare Services, a
Columbia, Md.-based company hired to find temporary shelter for
children in state custody. Maxim officials refused to comment for
this story.</TE>
<TE>   During the day, Maxim's staff closely watched the children, hotel
supervisor Melody Major told the Post. But, she said, it was a
different story after a 7 p.m. shift change.</TE>
<TE>   "It was crazy. At night, it was like the girls were on their own,"
Major said. "There didn't seem to be anyone around, no supervision."</TE>
<TE>   May did not say where the girls are currently housed, or if Maxim
is still providing supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Police said witnesses reported seeing the girls with men at pool
parties that appeared to involve alcohol and marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "The environment does not appear to be the safest place to house
children that are waiting to be placed in foster care," West Palm
Beach Police Officer Nicole Maale wrote in her report.</TE>
<TE>   May agreed but said the state has no choice, as the number of
children awaiting placement about doubled to 117, from December to
May, in Palm Beach County.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just nowhere to put them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The DCF is under scrutiny for its mishandling of cases statewide.
In April, the agency reported the disappearance of 5-year-old Rilya
Wilson, who was under state care and was missing for 15 months before
officials noticed.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J.</KH>
<HD>Scars From Anthrax Attacks Are Fading but Are Not Fully
Healed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J.</DL>
<LD>HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. --A skateboard park just opened. Little
League and the soccer season are in full bloom. And roads are crowded
on weekends with beach-goers heading for the Jersey shore.</LD>
<LD>   For many residents here, the rituals of summer have softened
memories of last fall's anthrax attacks, when this quiet community
gained national recognition as an epicenter of bacterial terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But just a glimpse of the Hamilton Mail Processing Center provides
an instant reminder. Sheets of thick black plastic still cover every
door, window and opening of the sprawling, low-rise brown brick
building where anthrax-laced letters felled three workers.</LD>
<TE>   "Sure you have to think about it when you ride by," said Jim
Stevens, 55, a maintenance man in the nearby township of East
Windsor, N.J. "See the windows, you see what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   At least four tainted letters passed through the Hamilton Township
building in September and October. More than eight months later, the
building remains closed; its more than 1,000 workers have been
reassigned to other area facilities. Many residents still pick up
their mail from a trailer parked out front.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Postal Service plans to decontaminate the building after
it attempts to remove anthrax spores from the Brentwood postal
facility in Washington. The date when work will start in New Jersey
is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder whether it will ever happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The post office is a biological monument," said Dr. Robert
Silverbrook, a local internist whose practice includes 150 postal
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many postal workers here who swallowed powerful
antibiotics for three months, anxieties linger. Some employees
question how safe the Hamilton building will be if it reopens. And
most are frustrated by an hourlong commute each way to temporary
assignments at other mail sorting facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The clerks are being told they are not sure if they are going to
do processing here," said Richard Zerrenner, a letter carrier and
secretary of Branch 380 of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers. He
and his wife worked in the building. "We don't know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   But for others in the Hamilton community of 87,000, the sense of
impending danger has receded.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Mellan, 78, who has lived in the same house for 50 years and
worked in advertising until he retired, said most residents have
moved on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk with people every morning over coffee," he said. "There
hasn't been any more discussion about the anthrax."</TE>
<TE>   Richard McClellan, chief of staff for Mayor Richard D. Gilmore,
agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "People are interested in their own lives," McClellan said. "We
learned that the world is a far smaller place than we thought and
things far away can affect us locally.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Hamilton is the eighth-biggest municipality in the
state, we really are a small town ... with small-town values and a
small-town way of life."</TE>
<TE>   City officials like to boast that motorists here can travel to New
York, about 50 miles away, without stopping at a traffic light. The
community is also within easy reach of Philadelphia and Trenton, New
Jersey's capital.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, a steady stream of families from New York and
northern New Jersey searching for less crowded schools, a less
stressful life and lower crime rates have moved here.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of anthrax shook that sense of security, especially
after two postal workers contracted inhalation anthrax and a third
came down with the cutaneous form of the disease. All survived.</TE>
<TE>   At Harry's Army &amp; Navy Store directly across a busy highway from
the contaminated building, panic was acute.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," said Mark Horwitz, the store's purchasing
agent, remembering the rush for gas masks. "We had back orders in the
hundreds."</TE>
<TE>   "We had people cry in the store," said Marcia Shoesmith, pausing
between ringing up sales at a cash register. "They wanted gas masks
for the dogs and everything.... Money was not an option. They were
going to protect the family."</TE>
<TE>   But the clamor for gas masks has ended.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Silverbrook's practice, too, has grown calmer since the days
when he was besieged by patients fearful that they were exposed.</TE>
<TE>   But he still is treating postal workers suffering from symptoms of
anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of biological warfare passed through their hands," the
physician said. "Handling every piece of mail could end your life. It
was like being a bomb specialist."</TE>
<TE>   "I am seeing people who are fearful of other biological weapons,"
Silverbrook added. "... I tell them, hopefully, there will not be
another biological attack. The best thing to do is, they should be
living their life."</TE>

<HD>17 Blazes Charring the West</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: With more than 2 million acres burned so far
this year, questions arise about the federal government's fire policy
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Two side-by-side fires raced out of control toward homes here
Saturday, forcing the evacuation of more than 15,000 residents and
dramatizing how a confluence of weather conditions and forestry
practices has made this fire season the most treacherous in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Already this year nearly 2.3 million acres have burned nationwide,
far eclipsing the 1.3 million acres burned by the same date during
the disastrous 2000 fire season and dwarfing the 10-year average of
about 920,000 acres.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday alone, 127,138 acres were added to the tally.</LD>
<TE>   "Conditions have never been worse," said Tina Boehle, a
spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of high temperatures and low humidity is the
immediate ingredient feeding the 17 major fires burning in eight
Western states. The extended drought has added a powerful punch to
the mix, leaving the nation's forests especially vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   But these fires also are so large and are burning so intensely
because of a decades-long government policy that hasn't allowed the
practice of setting forest fires under controlled circumstances to
reduce the brush and timber that stoke wildfires so hot that
firefighters can't get close enough to fight them.</TE>
<TE>   The federal policy, influenced heavily by public opinion, also
demanded that wildfires be extinguished as quickly as possible, even
though some experts say the fires, if allowed to run their course,
would ultimately have left the forests less prone to infernos.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire prevention that we saw throughout the 20th century is
now bearing fruit--by leading to catastrophic wildfires," said Allen
Mattison, spokesman for the Sierra Club. "The attitude of the Forest
Service for decades was, as soon as a forest fire was spotted, to
have it out by 10 the next morning. That defied the laws of nature."</TE>
<TE>   In Show Low, the call to evacuate came at 7 p.m. Saturday. In the
largest evacuation of this fire season, 7,700 residents were ordered
out of town after the Rodeo fire, which has burned more than 150,000
acres of forest since Tuesday, breached what authorities considered
the critical point, about eight miles west of town.</TE>
<TE>   For days, many residents here had been packing their cars in
anticipation of the call. Within minutes, streets were gridlocked
under skies that glowed with fireballs spit high into the air from
the approaching fire. U.S. 60, the only highway to the Phoenix area,
was closed, forcing vehicles to the northeast out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, neighboring Pinetop-Lakeside, with 3,500
residents, also was evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   By 11 p.m., the fire was a couple of miles from Show Low. "Nothing
is going to stop it [from reaching the city].... We will have a lot
of fire in town," fire official Jim Paxon said.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller fire had burned to within six miles of the Rodeo fire,
and officials said they assumed the two blazes would merge by today.
Fire information officer Rob Deyerberg said that then the blaze would
move faster and burn more fuel, making it harder to fight. "If it
merges it just gets worse."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, new philosophies emerged about the merits of
controlled burns to prevent disasters like this.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Americans listened to Smokey Bear, subscribing to the
strict theory that all forest fires were bad. In 1988, when
government officials let a wildfire sweep through nearly a million
acres of Yellowstone National Park, the public was outraged and the
incident opened the door to reconsidering the nation's fire policy.
In 2000, the Clinton administration put forth a national fire plan
that called for prescribed burns and forest thinning as effective
fire prevention tools. But the controlled burns have been
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, a controlled burn in New Mexico's Bandelier
National Monument backfired disastrously. It was poorly planned,
understaffed and blew out of control.</TE>
<TE>   The intentionally set fire burned 43,000 acres, destroyed
facilities at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, leveled about 200
homes and fueled renewed public opposition to the practice. The
government has paid more than $100 million in damages to businesses
and homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 1.3 million acres has been burned nationwide in
prescribed fires, according to government statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Forest planners say more timber could have been saved this year
had there been more controlled fires in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The 137,000-acre Hayman fire southwest of Denver exploded across
lands where little had been done to thin forests. As a result,
relatively benign ground fires have reached the crowns of mature
trees, causing the most intense blazes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've neglected the role of prescribed fires," said Jim Anderson,
a planner for the Apache Sitgreaves National Forest. But Anderson and
others say reducing combustible material in the nation's forests to
manageable levels through controlled burns now will be a daunting
exercise in catching up. Part of the problem, they say, is that much
of the public still is opposed to prescribed burns.</TE>
<TE>   When controlled burns were set recently in the Apache Sitgreaves
National Forest, where the Rodeo fire now rages, nearby residents
complained to state air quality officials about the smoke. The state
pressured Forest Service officials to extinguish the blazes
prematurely, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Other plans to start controlled burns have been blocked by
litigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, as fire closed in on Show Low, Paxon said,
"Mother Nature can't stand the congestion on the hill over there,"
referring to the heavy forest growth, "and she's starting over."</TE>
<TE>   Controlled burns are especially tricky affairs this summer, given
the drought. Intentionally setting a forest ablaze requires immense
planning and staffing, at a cost of millions of dollars. Some experts
wonder whether it's too late to set controlled fires, given the
decades-long buildup of combustible material in the forests.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got messed-up forests, you'll have messed-up fires,"
said Stephen Pyne, an Arizona State University fire expert who can
see the smoke of the Show Low fires from his home in Alpine.</TE>
<TE>   "Just putting fire back in [the forest] is not ecological pixie
dust. It's an immense problem. Those fires will behave differently."</TE>
<TE>   Pyne likened the challenge of clearing the forests to that of
cleaning up toxic waste sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some kind of superfund," he said. "It would be a huge,
messy project that nobody wants to deal with. We're decades past a
simple solution. Now we have to accept what's out there."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, Pyne and others say the forests need to be cleared of
small trees, not just through fire but through commercial harvesting.
But most timber companies have little use for the small trees, so
there's little profit incentive for them to help out.But even with
the renewed prescribed burns and some harvesting of small trees,
Anderson said the thinning efforts are not keeping up with the growth
of the forest. It's growing about 275 million board-feet a year, he
said, while thinning is reducing it by about 30 million board-feet.
"We can't keep up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Morrison, executive director of the Pacific Biodiversity
Institute in Winthrop, Wash., cautions that the Forest Service
shouldn't be the fall guy.</TE>
<TE>   From 1992 to 2001, national forest land accounted for only about
17% of the total wildfire burn area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People have this very mistaken perception that all these fires
are happening in national forest lands, and if we just changed forest
management we wouldn't have these fires," he said. "We've got to get
over this misconception that it's national forest management that is
the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Most fires, he said, burned across grass and shrub lands.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's largest fires, however, were marching mostly
through big timber.</TE>
<TE>   In Show Low, officials asked residents to hang a white rag or
T-shirt on doors to show homes had been evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were directed to Eagar, 40 miles to the east, or
Holbrook, about 45 miles north. Evacuation centers there put out
requests for blankets and sleeping bags as they awaited the deluge of
evacuees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the smaller Chediski fire crossed another fire line and
entered Heber-Overgaard, an already evacuated community of 2,700
about 25 miles to the west, Paxon said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest of the two fires was thought to be caused by humans,
although authorities didn't know whether it was an accident or arson.
The second, smaller fire was started by a lost hiker signaling for
help.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Denver, the Hayman fire was more than 60% contained and
had not grown for two days. It has destroyed at least 114 homes and
424 other structures.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Colorado, the Million fire near South Fork had burned
8,000 acres and was 20% contained; 11 homes had burned, but evacuated
residents were being allowed to return. Near Durango, the Missionary
Ridge fire had grown to more than 67,000 acres and was 25% contained.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Utah, a 72,000-acre fire 20 miles northeast of
Panguitch in the Dixie National Forest was 50% contained.</TE>
<TE>   In eastern Arizona, firefighters were assigned to the quieter
flanks, while the heads of the two fires were being targeted by
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Paxon said he wished for more airplanes. And the word from the
fire headquarters in Boise: Sorry, but the nation's other 37 air
tankers are committed to fighting other fires.</TE>

<HD>Death Penalty Curb Is Unlikely to Signal a Shift</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: Justices O'Connor and Kennedy were the keys
to a ban on executing the mentally retarded. But experts don't
foresee a trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For a moment last week, when the justices announced an end to
executing the mentally retarded, it was as though the boldly liberal
Warren Court had unseated the conservative Rehnquist Court of today.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Justice Earl Warren, who led the court in the 1950s and
'60s, was known for a progressive view of the Constitution and a
willingness to use the court's power to cast aside settled practices,
from segregation to school prayer. The 8th Amendment's ban on cruel
and unusual punishment "draws its meaning from the evolving standards
of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society," Warren
wrote in one famous passage.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of shifting standard grates on Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia, who believe the Constitution
should be interpreted as it was written in the 18th century, not by
today's standards.</LD>
<TE>   They sat glumly Thursday as Justice John Paul Stevens quoted
Warren's words to say the nation's standard of decency now calls for
a permanent ban on death sentences for mentally retarded offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But experts who closely monitor capital punishment--supporters as
well as opponents--do not see last week's ruling as a signal that the
high court is turning away from the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "One case isn't a trend," said USC law professor Erwin
Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, last week's ruling marked the first time in Rehnquist's
16-year reign as chief justice that the court had imposed a
significant limit on the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist has led the court's conservative majority in a series of
rulings that made it easier for states to carry out executions and
harder for inmates to appeal. The landmark capital punishment rulings
of the Rehnquist era have rejected moves to restrict the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, the court, on a 5-4 vote, rejected claims that the death
sentencing system in the South was infected with racial bias. In
1989, the justices said, again by a 5-4 vote, that states could
execute murderers who were as young as 16 when they committed their
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Rehnquist spoke for the court in saying that new evidence
showing a death row inmate might be innocent was not enough to reopen
his case. The dissenting justices called the ruling "astonishing" and
a violation of "any standard of decency."</TE>
<TE>   But all along, Rehnquist's narrow majority has required the vote
of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a former state legislator who is
attuned to shifting political winds. And unlike Scalia and Rehnquist,
O'Connor has said her judgment about what is cruel and unusual
punishment would turn on the climate of current legal opinion.</TE>
<TE>   For O'Connor, the fact that 18 states had passed laws exempting
mentally retarded people from the death penalty gave her all the
evidence she needed to rule that this form of punishment is now
considered cruel and unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "In the light of the dramatic shift in the state legislative
landscape that has occurred in the past 13 years," Justice Stevens
said, "it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed
against" executing mentally retarded people.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a true surprise in Thursday's ruling, it was that
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy sided with the majority to outlaw
executions of the mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, O'Connor and Kennedy joined Rehnquist in reinstating a
Tennessee man's death sentence, even though his lawyer had failed to
present an argument to his sentencing jury in favor of sparing his
client's life.</TE>
<TE>   And just two weeks ago, O'Connor and Kennedy joined the 5-4
majority that cleared the way for the execution of Virginia inmate
Walter Mickens, whose trial lawyer failed to disclose that he had
once represented the young victim of his client.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
pro-death penalty group in Sacramento, expects the Rehnquist Court
will continue to be an ally.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly don't see this as a prelude to a judicial move to
abolish the death penalty. I think that is long past," he said.
Unlike during the 1960s and 1970s, none of the current justices
believes capital punishment itself is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Still, death penalty opponents were heartened by last week's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it signals a new openness on their part to reflecting on
the death penalty," said Northwestern University law professor
Lawrence Marshall, a former court clerk who leads the Chicago-based
Center for Wrongful Convictions. "America is ahead of the court now
on the issue, and it's saying the death penalty is riddled with
unfairness."</TE>
<TE>   If the court has shifted on the death penalty, the first sign
might come as soon as this week.</TE>
<TE>   The justices are set to hand down a ruling in an Arizona case that
challenges state laws that permit judges, rather than juries, to
impose a death sentence. If they side with the inmate who is
appealing, it could upset more than 800 death sentences nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "If they reverse in Ring [vs. Arizona], that would be a major
indicator of real change," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   But the court rarely makes sudden, surprising shifts. Thursday's
ruling was foreshadowed by a similar case decided 13 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1989, the fate of Johnny Paul Penry, a Texas murderer with
the mental age of a 7-year-old, depended on O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   The four liberal justices who opposed the death penalty were
committed to overturning his death sentence and outlawing the
execution of mentally retarded people. The four conservatives,
including Rehnquist and Scalia, voted to send Penry to his execution.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor was squarely in the middle. She voted with the liberals
to overturn Penry's death sentence because the jurors had not been
told to weigh his retardation as a reason to spare him. But she sided
with the conservatives in refusing to outlaw all executions of
mentally retarded people.</TE>
<TE>   Polls showed that most Americans opposed executions of retarded
people, but only Georgia had then outlawed the practice. O'Connor
said she was looking for "objective evidence," such as laws passed by
state legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   "While a national consensus against execution of the mentally
retarded may someday emerge reflecting the 'evolving standards of
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,' " O'Connor
wrote, quoting Earl Warren's words, "there is insufficient evidence
of such a consensus today."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the American Assn. on Mental Retardation took
O'Connor's statement as a call to action, and they pressed
legislatures to exempt the mentally retarded from their capital
punishment laws.</TE>
<TE>   In one state after another, lawmakers acted. Last year, when the
Supreme Court took up the case of a North Carolina death row inmate
who was mentally retarded, North Carolina lawmakers quickly repealed
capital punishment for the retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Texas and Oklahoma, two states where support for the death
penalty is strongest, lawmakers approved exemptions for the retarded
in the last year. However, the governors of both states vetoed the
bills.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Connor was convinced. In February, when the court heard the
case decided last week, Daryl Atkins vs. Virginia, she made it clear
she would vote to abolish executions of the mentally retarded.
Justice Kennedy, who voted with Scalia and Rehnquist in the 1989
case, unexpectedly joined her.</TE>
<TE>   Like O'Connor, Kennedy is a moderate conservative who was
appointed by President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and former clerks say Kennedy and O'Connor do not want to
be portrayed as hard-line conservatives. In 1992, they broke with
Rehnquist and Scalia by refusing to overturn the Roe vs. Wade ruling
on abortion. And in 1996, they sided with gay rights activists to
strike down a Colorado law that allowed discrimination based on
sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf, a former clerk to
Kennedy, believes they are influenced by international revulsion
against the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "They're globe-trotters, and they like to give speeches in Europe
and meet with judges there," Dorf said. "You can't feel welcome in
that crowd if you're an extremist on the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   In July, for example, Kennedy went to Salzburg, Austria, to teach
and later made other government-sponsored trips to Moscow and
Beijing. O'Connor lectured in Innsbruck, Austria; Zagreb, Croatia;
and Cambridge, England.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't help but notice the world is looking with scorn at the
American death penalty system," Marshall said.</TE>

<HD>Heavy Flooding Reported in Michigan, Wisconsin</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WAUTOMA, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Heavy downpours Saturday flooded roads, damaged a bridge and forced
the evacuation of a trailer park in central Wisconsin, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Weather Service reported that as much as 9 inches of
rain fell in some areas from storms that began Friday and intensified
overnight.</LD>
<LD>   A chance of more storms was forecast for the central and northern
portions of the state through the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The same storm system also hit parts of Michigan on Saturday,
hampering cleanup efforts from earlier storms. About 9,000 Consumers
Energy Co. customers lost power Friday and about 1,150 remained
without service Saturday, spokeswoman Leslie Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of the storm damage cleaned up, but another storm
came through the Saginaw area this morning," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, 8 feet to 10 feet of water collected beneath overpasses
in areas south of Detroit, and one shopping center closed because its
parking lots flooded.</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, water standing as deep as 4 feet closed many roads
Saturday in Wautoma, said Waushara County sheriff's Det. Steve
Rodger. He said flooding also damaged a bridge in Plainfield. Road
closings were reported in Adams, Clark and Portage counties.</TE>
<TE>   Flooding forced the evacuation of a trailer park in Stratford,
Wis., said Marathon County sheriff's dispatcher Tony Nardi. Nardi did
not have any immediate details of how many people were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, lightning struck a natural gas storage facility in
Oak Creek, Wis., forcing residents to evacuate, said Margaret
Stanfield, a We Energies spokeswoman. She said lightning ignited some
venting gas, causing a fire but no explosions.</TE>

<HD>Transportation Secretary, Amtrak to Meet on Bailout Options</HD>
<DH>Trains: Rail service throughout the country could be
affected if bankruptcy is declared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said Saturday
that the Bush administration "is not interested in allowing Amtrak to
shut down," and he arranged to meet with the railroad's board Monday
afternoon to determine what the administration can do to prevent it.</LD>
<LD>   The administration also no longer insists on wholesale "reforms"
of Amtrak as part of a rescue, but it wants assurances that the
passenger train corporation will impose fiscal discipline and
increase the flow of information to the government, administration
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak President David Gunn has said the rail line is so low on
cash that it will have to begin an "orderly shutdown" and declare
bankruptcy when Congress goes into recess, probably Wednesday or
Thursday, unless the administration gives it a loan guarantee or
Congress grants it $200 million. A shutdown would end all the
country's intercity passenger train service and would stop or
seriously affect most of the country's commuter trains.</LD>
<TE>   Federal Railroad Administration workers are trying to determine
whether the government can legally guarantee a loan under a law
intended for long-term capital needs, the Railroad Rehabilitation and
Improvement Financing Program. Deliberations so far indicate that
there may be a way to do it, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration sources said Mineta's meeting with the Amtrak board
is partly intended to assure the nation that a shutdown almost
certainly would not occur, and particularly to reassure commuter
railroad operators wary about being caught up in a shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   The sources also said administration officials don't think they've
received adequate financial information from Amtrak and want to
determine if there are alternatives to loan guarantees or
appropriations, including the release of un- obligated funds or
transferring money in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people [in the administration] are focusing on the
problem," Gunn said in an interview, adding that Mineta's request for
a meeting "sounds positive to me."</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said that, even though the administration doesn't want
Amtrak to shut down, "Amtrak must face the reality that difficult
decisions need to be made and fundamental management changes need to
take place to keep the company alive."</TE>
<TE>   Mineta proposed last week that states pay more of passenger train
costs, that Amtrak's Boston-Washington Northeast Corridor be spun off
to an unspecified "public partnership" and that some Amtrak routes
and jobs be contracted out.</TE>
<TE>   Some congressional sources viewed Saturday's Transportation
Department news release as a dig at Gunn, who's known to have angered
some administration officials with his outspokenness in only five
weeks on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The news release noted that only the Amtrak board can shut down
operations and declare bankruptcy. The release also seemed to
criticize Gunn's testimony Thursday to the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on transportation, in which he said that the orderly
shutdown would have to start sooner than some had expected and that
Mineta's proposals were misguided and unworkable.</TE>
<TE>   "DOT officials and others found Gunn's testimony alarming since it
described a significant acceleration of deadlines reported to the
board of directors as recently as three weeks ago," the
Transportation Department statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn said, however, that he thought the department was stating the
obvious because legally only the board can declare bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal of Amtrak's board meeting on Monday should be to ensure
the continuation of rail service .... The goal should not be to
chastise a CEO for sharing his frank and experienced views," said
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).</TE>

<HD>Group Aims to Have Every Vote Counted</HD>
<DH>Politics: Monitoring of polls is planned. The action stems
from the 2000 presidential election, when the ballots of thousands of
blacks were rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Reggie Fullwood, the City Council's junior member, recalls the
immense frustration and sense of helplessness like it was yesterday.
It was the last presidential election, and thousands of ballots cast
by fellow African American voters were being tossed out.</LD>
<LD>   "I can remember sitting there watching TV and thinking, I'm an
elected official, but I can't do anything," said Fullwood, 27. "When
my grandmother called and said, 'I wonder if my vote counted,' I
couldn't do anything."</LD>
<LD>   Though much of the country may have moved on, memories of the 2000
presidential contest remain vivid and raw among Florida blacks. In
this north Florida city alone, more than 10,000 ballots cast by
African Americans were rejected as invalid--more than enough to put
Democratic candidate Al Gore, and not Republican George W. Bush, in
the White House.</LD>
<TE>   To guarantee that each vote this November counts, a motley
grass-roots coalition--embracing organizations as disparate as labor
unions, churches and Masonic lodges--is forming. Many of its leading
voices, like black voters as a whole, are avowedly pro-Democratic,
but the common goal is mobilizing African Americans so they remain a
potent political force in this increasingly diverse state.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time," said Isaiah Jesse Williams III, publisher of
the Jacksonville Advocate, a weekly newspaper that caters to the
black community. "Because if we don't organize this time, we're going
to be cut out of the loop altogether."</TE>
<TE>   One project, already begun, is the creation of so-called voter
protection squads that will go to the polls in predominantly African
American neighborhoods on election day. The volunteers, who will
include black fraternity and sorority members, will wear T-shirts
identifying them and promoting a toll-free hotline that voters can
call for assistance. The volunteers also will be issued cell phones
so they can contact panels of black lawyers that are being assembled.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be able to advise voters of their rights or file a
protest if there is a dispute," said Tony Hill, 44, a union organizer
active in the effort and a former Democratic member of the state
House of Representatives running for the state Senate. "This time,
we'll be watching."</TE>
<TE>   Experts cannot explain why more than 50% of the disqualified
Florida ballots were cast by black voters, but they cite confusing
ballot designs, unreliable voting machines and an effort to cut
felons from voter rolls that also winnowed out legitimate voters. But
among the African American communities here, the belief is widespread
their votes were intentionally sacrificed so a Republican candidate
would win.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to the grass-roots campaign's zeal and sense of
mission is this fall's governor's race in Florida. Up for reelection
is the president's brother, Republican Jeb Bush, who, many Florida
Democrats suspect, helped mastermind his older sibling's presidential
victory, which hinged on Florida's 25 electoral votes.</TE>
<TE>   Many black leaders already held Jeb Bush at arm's length after he
eliminated affirmative action in the state university system and
government purchasing. They say his One Florida policy--aimed at
offering equal opportunity for all to compete for state
contracts--has harmed minorities. "We don't have one Florida, but a
divided Florida," Andrew Gillum, then student body president at
Florida A&amp;M University, said at a rally in Tallahassee last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy voter turnout by blacks is considered vital if Janet Reno,
the former U.S. attorney general and the leading Democratic
gubernatorial candidate, is to have a fighting chance against Bush.
One poll this month showed the Republican incumbent beating Reno, 57%
to 35%. During a visit last week to Ponte Vedra Beach, Reno said she
needs a presidential election turnout in a nonpresidential year to
win.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're rich and you've got a lot of money, you're going to
vote for Bush," said Richard Danford, president of the Jacksonville
Urban League and a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   To help people of more modest means defend their interests, the
Urban League is enlisting the Head Start programs it administers
here. In August, when parents drop off the 2,000 children enrolled in
the programs, staff members will be on hand to demonstrate the new
voting machines to be used in November, Danford said. Twenty-four
Urban League workers also will be trained as computer-capable poll
watchers in African American precincts, so they can use laptops at
polling stations to access official records if someone's right to
vote is challenged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just one grass-roots effort to do something proactive
rather than complaining," Danford said. "In this country, the land of
the free and the home of the brave, why should some people have to
worry about whether their vote is counted?"</TE>
<TE>   In Duval County, Elections Supervisor John Stafford blames the
2000 mess on Jacksonville's old voting system, in which people
punched their ballot with a stylus. Many people didn't make their
holes in the right place, or punched too many for the ballots to be
valid, he said. From now on, in accordance with election reforms
enacted by the Florida Legislature, voters here will color in small
circles to indicate their candidate choice.</TE>
<TE>   Stafford, a Republican, is keenly conscious of the criticism he
and other GOP election officials have received from African Americans
and acknowledges that "we're going to be under scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   To make sure the public is familiar with the new voting system, he
has hired three employees to organize show-and-tell sessions across
Jacksonville. "We've been out to churches, nursing homes, fairs,"
Stafford said. "I figure we've touched 14,000 people by now."</TE>
<TE>   The local chapter of the National Council of Negro Women used the
machines, provided by Stafford's office, to hold a mock election at a
recent meeting. "Now we're prepared to help other people if they
should ask us," said Vera Cruse, president of the 300-member chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts, experience shows, are vital if Florida's 1 million
black voters are to exercise their due influence. Despite a record
African American turnout of about 893,000 voters in November 2000,
many who came to the polls for the first time did not know how to
cast their ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we have to do is make sure people are educated
on how to use the new equipment," said Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat
who represents the Jacksonville area. "When we have community
activities, whether it be football or basketball games, we need to
get those machines out there and let people practice with them."</TE>
<TE>   In part, the grass-roots drive is a response to the Bush
administration's decision not to pursue further legal action arising
from complaints in Florida about the presidential election. "We can't
wait for [the Department of] Justice to do anything for us," Earl
O'Neal, a political action specialist with the AFL-CIO, said at a
town hall meeting on voter rights this month in Jacksonville. "We
have to educate people on the election laws in this country. We have
to question local election officials about their procedures."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for some of the Florida mobilization is an avowedly
nonpartisan campaign for voter rights developed and underwritten by
the Washington-based People for the American Way Foundation. The
organization, which is also trying to improve voting conditions for
Latinos and people with disabilities, devised the voter protection
plan, which includes the T-shirted poll workers, hotline and lawyers
on standby.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme was tested in 2001 elections in Virginia and New Jersey
and will be used this year in Florida and nine other states,
foundation President Ralph G. Neas said. The foundation has allotted
$750,000 in seed money for Florida, out of a $3 million budget.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is a heck of a lot of people in Florida and about
3.5 million people nationwide were disenfranchised in 2000," Neas
said. With Florida's Sept. 10 primary elections less than three
months away, and the general election on Nov. 5, Fullwood said there
is apprehension but also resolve among the 55,000 residents of his
district.</TE>
<TE>   "People are anxious in a sense. Anxious over how the new voting
machines work, anxious over what the turnout will be," said the young
African American politician. "They want to prove to the world that
they know how to vote."</TE>
