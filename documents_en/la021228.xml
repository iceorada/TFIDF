<HD>The truth? Just try to catch it if you can</HD>
<DH>A teen con man's tale was impossible to verify even before
it got the Hollywood treatment.</DH>

<LD>A brazen escape through an airport, with a bevy of comely
stewardesses-in-training, right under the nose of the FBI. A
deliciously successful impersonation of an emergency room physician
-- complete with swinging parties and sexy entanglements on the side.
A harrowing stay in a French prison. And all before the protagonist
was old enough to drink.</LD>
<LD>   Some viewers of Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me if You Can," the
story of teenage con man Frank Abagnale, may walk out of the theater
wondering how much of the picture's audacious larceny is true.</LD>
<LD>   They'll never know.</LD>
<TE>   Directors and screenwriters routinely take liberties with real
life, usually in the belief that it suffers from a poorly timed
dramatic arc or insufficient conflict. But this film -- which claims
merely to be "inspired" by actual events -- has an even trickier
relationship with the truth because its source material is largely
unverifiable.</TE>
<TE>   What's known: In 1970, Abagnale was arrested by the FBI, which
suspected him of posing as a Pan Am pilot and cashing forged checks
in a number of cities. He served almost four years in prison. Once
released in 1974, he began working as a check-fraud consultant to the
government as a condition of his parole, then gradually expanded to a
private-sector consulting business. His appearances on several
"Tonight" shows in the late '70s led to a 1980 first-person book
whose title the movie borrows.</TE>
<TE>   What's unverified are most of the intriguing claims in both the
book and the movie, all of which Abagnale says are true: That,
beginning at age 16, he cashed $2.5 million in bad checks in every
U.S. state and two dozen foreign countries. That his impersonation of
a Pan Am pilot -- which helped him wangle free transportation to stay
one step ahead of the law -- went on for the better part of five
years. That he also posed for months at a time as a hospital
pediatric supervisor, a college sociology professor and an assistant
district attorney. That he spent six months in French prison when
authorities there caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale, now 54, with a highly successful business catering to
financial institutions, is a man of charm, polish and evident
intelligence whose nuts-and-bolts knowledge of fraud melds perfectly
with his teenage scenario. Over the years, those who have tried to
independently verify his escapades have been told by Abagnale that he
would never embarrass the people or institutions he conned by naming
them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at a San
Francisco anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter took
apart Abagnale's assertions at the seminar and on a subsequent
"Tonight" show appearance. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals
and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of
his cons under the aliases he used, the Chronicle said.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale's response then: "Due to the embarrassment involved, I
doubt if anyone would confirm the information." Asked recently about
the incident, he said he had intentionally used incorrect names.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Abagnale's account of his years of fraud, written
with a professional writer, the late Stan Redding, was published by a
Manhattan publishing house. Although it read like an autobiography,
it featured a strange prefacing sentence: "This book is based on the
true-life exploits of Frank Abagnale. To protect the right of those
whose paths have crossed the author's, all of the characters and some
of the events have been altered, and all names, dates and places have
been changed."</TE>
<TE>   Several efforts to turn the book into a film stagnated. Finally,
Spielberg's DreamWorks prevailed. As the film began to attract media
attention this fall, Abagnale added a page to his business Web site
to acknowledge the gaps between the book, the film and the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was interviewed by the [book's] co-writer only about four
times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also
over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style
and what the editor wanted," Abagnale wrote. "He always reminded me
that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography. This
is one of the reasons that from the very beginning, I insisted the
publisher put a disclaimer in the book and tapes."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers were not shy about changing Abagnale's story. To
heighten the pain of his parents' divorce, they made him an only
child, rather than one of four. To enrich the relationship with his
father, they turned his straight-arrow dad into a hustler. They
compressed the narrative from five years to three. They doubled the
amount of money Abagnale said he stole. They invented an FBI agent
who pursued Abagnale around the country early on in his scam and
eventually to France, when in fact the lack of a coordinated law
enforcement effort allowed Abagnale to avoid detection for years.
(The epilogue goes so far as to credit the fictitious FBI agent -- a
composite character -- with the career honors won by the real FBI
agent who arrested Abagnale but spent little time on the case.)</TE>
<TE>   Said screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, who worked on the script for
three years, "Nobody really cares about ... having to know exactly
what happened. But it does matter that we stayed true to sort of what
we know happened emotionally to him as a kid." Still, Nathanson said,
the "focus on what's true and what's not true" is "very hard for me
... after spending all these years on it, because it sort of deflates
the effort that we've all been making" to get to the emotional
validity.</TE>
<TE>   "Frank's an interesting guy and I consider him a friend, but ...
he doesn't really allow people to get to know him all that well,"
Nathanson said. "I don't know if anyone will ever know the actual
truth."</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale acknowledged that the movie audience will be watching a
cinematic approximation of his life based on an already stretched
literary approximation. "Basically, I felt the movie was more
accurate than the book, but in the final analysis only I really
know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now married, the father of three sons and living in Oklahoma,
Abagnale says he has taken pains throughout his adult life to condemn
his youthful behavior, and had no role or financial interest in the
making of the movie. He feels it is unfair for people to challenge
his veracity. "I hope some day people will judge me on how I've spent
the last 25 years of my life and not on a few years as a teenager,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Ending the year on a bleak note</HD>
<DH>Album sales continue a downward trend, but the top 10
sellers reflect a wide range of styles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, at least Eminem had a good year.</LD>
<LD>   The music industry, already in hand-wringing mode about its
future, had a grim 2002 with a 9% decline -- to $624.2 million -- in
album sales. It was the second consecutive year of decline in a
business that had been accustomed to annual growth.</LD>
<LD>   The best-selling album in 2002 was "The Eminem Show," which sold
7.4 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan sales reports
through Dec. 22.</LD>
<TE>   The Detroit rapper also made the leap to movie star this year with
the quasi-biographical "8 Mile." The film's soundtrack sold 3.2
million copies to land at No. 5 on the list of 2002's bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   The top 10 sellers for the year may not have been as hot as in
past years (in 2000, eight albums topped 4 million in sales; this
year, only two did) but they represented an eclectic bunch. St. Louis
rapper Nelly, benefiting from the ubiquitous hit "Hot in Herre,"
finished at No. 2 with his "Nellyville" album selling 4.8 million
copies.</TE>
<TE>   Avril Lavigne, the young singer-songwriter who some hail as a
welcome respite from frothy teen pop, finished at No. 3 with "Let
Go," a debut package that sold 3.9 million copies. Meanwhile, "Home,"
the latest album from the Dixie Chicks, not only sold 3.4 million
copies to finish at No. 4 for the year, but also pushed the country
trio to a new level in pop history. With 19 million albums sold, the
Chicks surpassed TLC as the best-selling female album group ever.</TE>
<TE>   After "8 Mile" at No. 5, the top 10 was rounded out by: Pink's
"Missundaztood," (3 million); Ashanti's "Ashanti" (3 million); Alan
Jackson's "Drive" (3 million); the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
soundtrack (2.7 million) and Shania Twain's "Up!" (2.6 million). The
"O Brother" soundtrack is the only 2001 release in the top 10,
continuing the unlikely success story of the collection of folk and
traditional music that won the Grammy for best album of 2001. Its
total sales now stand at 6.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among genres in pop music, the most noticeable difference in 2002
was country music's 11% jump, much of that due to Alan Jackson and
the return to the scene of hugely popular female stars Twain, the
Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill. While individual titles were success
stories, many in the music industry fear the larger trends dragging
in business.</TE>
<TE>   This year's music-sales declines follow a 3% dip last year. The
usual culprits cited are the vagaries of the economy and their effect
of leisure purchases, such as music and, more specifically, the
advent of the digital download culture, which sees many young people
plucking their music online without payment.</TE>

<HD>Less air time for police chases?</HD>
<DH>Some TV executives fret that the chief will call on them to
cut coverage as part of his effort to limit pursuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton may try to cut the chase
in the near future, and it has some local television news executives
worried.</LD>
<LD>   In the next few weeks, the LAPD is expected to finalize a report
to the Los Angeles Police Commission that recommends banning a
majority of police pursuits that begin as minor infractions. The
proposal comes in response to a series of high-profile chases and
collisions this year that resulted in a death and several injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Related to Bratton's broad initiative on police chases, the LAPD
is also considering asking television stations to eliminate or
significantly reduce their coverage of live police chases. The
broadcast of police pursuits is more entertainment than informative,
Bratton has said publicly and in informal discussions with local news
executives, and could be interpreted as encouraging criminal
activity.</LD>
<TE>   Such a change would mark a distinct shift for local TV stations.
At least since O.J. Simpson led police on a low-speed drive through
the streets and freeways of Los Angeles soon after his ex-wife and
her friend were killed, Los Angeles television stations have had a
fascination with police chases. It's not uncommon for local news to
devote large chunks of their broadcasts to helicopter shots of police
pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to be a largely local phenomenon, owing to the extensive
freeway system and wide surface streets that make chases possible,
and the willingness of local stations to televise the pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of Bratton formally calling on news stations to
cut down on their coverage of police chases already has prompted
defensiveness and nervousness among some news executives. Although
the live broadcast of such chases has been controversial for years,
news directors have traditionally maintained the coverage is
newsworthy, and useful for warning residents and commuters about
police activity in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcasters privately admit that police pursuits are often
audience grabbers that boost ratings, and that they must provide live
coverage to stay competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing some anxiety about a potential plea by Bratton, one Los
Angeles news executive said, "This is something I don't even want to
think about right now. I really have to think it through carefully. I
want to see what the chief wants."</TE>
<TE>   However, the executive added, "I really haven't seen the last time
that news coverage of a police chase caused an accident."</TE>
<TE>   At least for now, the local stations have some breathing room.
Deputy Chief Gary J. Brennan said this week that Bratton -- who has
already met casually with several news executives and voiced his
concerns -- has no immediate plans to formally approach the stations
about their coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief is still working through many issues, and our primary
focus [is] changes in the pursuit policy," Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the television coverage of pursuits is not currently a
high priority, "Chief Bratton is still very concerned about it,"
Brennan said. "He feels that the chases are shown less as news
stories and more as entertainment or like sporting events. The
coverage tends to make these things into a spectacle. It's like it's
great fun, showing suspects running from the police."</TE>
<TE>   Under consideration is a ban on the use of minor infractions --
such as broken taillights, missing license plates or minor traffic
violations -- to justify a pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Those sorts of offenses account for at least 60% of all pursuits
by the LAPD, according to a review by the police commission, which
under the city charter must approve department policy.</TE>
<TE>   Said Brennan: "It's a double-edged sword. We want to manage the
pursuits. But if we become too restrictive, then we create a
situation where the suspects can use our policies against us and then
get away."</TE>
<TE>   KNBC executives have already expressed some reluctance to change
their policy on covering chases.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we do not automatically cover or air car chases, the LAPD's
decision to reduce car chases will have little effect on our news,"
station officials said in a statement. "Our coverage or non-coverage
of a breaking news story, whether it is a fire, accident, car chase,
earthquake, etc., is determined by the merits of that particular
story. The depth, length and placement of coverage is determined by
how relevant we think the news is to our readers."</TE>
<TE>   News executives at KABC, KCBS, KCAL, KTTV, and KCOP all declined
to comment on the record.</TE>
<TE>   But local news stations will likely face a delicate situation if
they are approached by Bratton about stopping or eliminating coverage
of police pursuits. News executives would be under no obligation to
follow the chief's suggestions, but conceivably they could be drawn
into a public relations battle with Bratton, who is known for his
outspokenness.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Wald, news director of KTLA, said he shares the chief's
concerns about police chases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become really ridiculous," Wald said of the televised police
pursuits. He said his station (owned by the Tribune Co., which also
owns the Los Angeles Times) does not usually break into regular
programming to cover a police pursuit unless there is "a major
reason."</TE>
<TE>   But Wald added that news executives still have to make hard
decisions about the newsworthiness of pursuits, particularly if large
numbers of people are affected.</TE>
<TE>   Wald has experience with the perils of covering live police
pursuits. In 1999, KTLA was one of three Los Angeles stations to
cover a live three-hour chase through four counties that ended with
the killing of the suspect after he brandished a gun at officers. The
shooting was broadcast live by television news helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   That incident was reminiscent of a situation in 1998 when several
local stations aired close-up shots of a man committing suicide at a
freeway interchange.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism by viewers and others of the coverage of those shootings
prompted several news directors to say they would reevaluate their
live coverage of pursuits and consider using a seven-second delay
mechanism in case the events turned tragic.</TE>
<TE>   But those devices were never used, and car chases still pop up
often.</TE>
<TE>   "We take a different approach to covering these chases ever since
the suicide," Wald said.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are still criteria that justify covering them,
especially if it's a dangerous situation. We know the chief is
concerned. We'll have to see what happens."</TE>

<HD>Jamie Bell is ready to make his move</HD>
<DH>A lot of teen roles came his way after 'Billy Elliot,' but
he held out for something more mature. He found it in 'Nicholas
Nickleby.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugh Hart</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A lot of people might have expected me to move out to L.A. and start
making studio movies and that kind of thing," says Jamie Bell,
slouched in a chair at a Beverly Hills restaurant, "but that just
isn't me. I'm doing all right."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the working-class teenager from northern England who beat
Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe and Geoffrey Rush to win the British Academy
of Film and Television Arts best actor trophy for his performance two
years ago in "Billy Elliot," seems to be doing just fine.</LD>
<LD>   Now 16, he's in town to talk about "Nicholas Nickleby." Based on
Charles Dickens' novel, the movie that opened Friday stars Charlie
Hunnam in the title role, with Bell as the urchin Smike.</LD>
<TE>   Subjected to a lifetime of beatings, the stooped Smike walks with
a limp and is trapped in servitude at a school for orphaned boys run
by sadistic Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent).</TE>
<TE>   Salvation arrives in the form of kindly young teacher Nicholas
Nickleby, who helps Smike escape from Dotheboys Hall. Together they
hit the road and briefly hook up with a traveling troupe of actors
before joining Nickleby's family in London.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole physical side of the character was something that
really attracted me to the role," says Bell, dressed in a T-shirt,
baggy blue jeans and an Eminem-branded skull cap. "Just from looking
at Smike, you get so much information: He's been beaten, he has no
one to love, no one loves him, he's got no parents, he doesn't have
an education. His deformity has come about not only because of the
beatings, but lack of attention and lack of care and all that sort of
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare, Bell read as much of the novel as he could -- in
between final exams at high school -- and watched "The Elephant Man"
and "My Left Foot" for inspiration. He also worked with a
choreographer to perfect the character's posture and gait.</TE>
<TE>   "That could be difficult sometimes because the director wanted
continuous movement," Bell says. "He'd say, 'You look like the
Hunchback of Notre Dame!' Smike's really learned to deal with it,
he's managed to get on with his life, with this problem, so we had to
show that by making his movement as fluid and natural as possible."</TE>
<TE>   "Nicholas Nickleby" writer-director Douglas McGrath joins his
young charge at the table. "Jamie's part is the heart of the movie,
and that's why it gave me the most concern as I was casting," he
says. "If Smike isn't right, nothing works. He is why the story is
there in the first place, because Smike is the symbol of what neglect
from society can do, and what price you pay for that."</TE>
<TE>   A stellar, seasoned cast</TE>
<TE>   For "Nickleby," McGrath assembled a stellar cast of seasoned
character actors, including Broadbent, Christopher Plummer, Tom
Courtenay, Timothy Spall, Alan Cumming and Nathan Lane.</TE>
<TE>   As compelling as Bell was as the blue-collar ballet dancer in
"Billy Elliot," didn't McGrath worry that the young, untrained actor
might be in over his head?</TE>
<TE>   "My only concern was, in 'Billy Elliot,' Jamie was the picture of
physical perfection, which is what ballet is all about -- achieving
the most you can from your body.</TE>
<TE>   "So I thought it was a great twist, but I didn't know if it was
one you wanted to do. Would you be willing now to take that control
over all those muscles and bones and use it to achieve imperfection.
And I felt it right away when we talked, because I could see how
serious he was.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Jamie had given one brilliant performance in 'Billy
Elliot' and that's all I'd seen him in," McGrath continues. "But the
thing I loved about Jamie when we first started working together,
everything he did was completely true -- nothing phony or mannered or
added on. I'd done lots and lots of auditions, and everybody else was
kind of begging all the time, and Jamie wasn't. He understood that
Smike wasn't about getting pity. It was just about being a survivor."</TE>
<TE>   "The thing of it is," Bell adds, "they've had all of this
training, and I haven't had any -- I'm just relying on the whole
natural talent thing. It's still a big learning curve for me, so I'm
just taking all the best bits that they have and stealing from them
and working with it."</TE>
<TE>   In character, on camera</TE>
<TE>   Broadbent in particular provided a lesson in how to save the
performance for the cameras. And for that, Bell jokes that he was
grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "Some actors will walk around being their character about 10
minutes before and, thank God, Jim didn't, because I just would have
been getting beaten all the time! Jim is quite reserved, but then
suddenly he becomes this almost demonic schoolteacher in a way, and
it seems really scary. But it's an honor to be beaten by Broadbent,
it is."</TE>
<TE>   Bell continues, "Doug said to me when I came into the meeting,
'I've got a rescue dog, and whenever you go up to him, it cowers and
moves away.' So when Nicholas goes up to Smike while he's reading a
book and just leans toward him, Smike flinches, because he's so used
to people coming up and giving him a quick slap around his ears.
That's just something that's part of his everyday life."</TE>
<TE>   Those hard knocks give way to a sweet denouement in "Nicholas
Nickleby," when Smike feels the full force of his brotherly bond with
Nickleby.</TE>
<TE>   "Dickens was writing ahead of his time in terms of family," Bell
says. "You know, Nathan sums it up in the last scene where he says
people we have in our family don't necessarily have to be blood
related. If we love them enough, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Bell can relate. Deserted by his father as a small child, he was
raised in Bellingham, England, by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   While making "Billy Elliot" he informally adopted the film's
director, Stephen Daldry, as his father. "You see the same kind of
thing in 'About a Boy' as well," Bell says, "where this man and this
kid find each other at a really difficult time in their lives, and by
the end of it, they've created this whole little family.</TE>
<TE>   "And you know, that's what happened for me. Without having had
that kind of father figure in my life, Stephen came along and we did
the movie and we became great friends. It's not like I suddenly said,
'Right. I want you to be my dad, so you're my dad now.' It's just a
decision that we kind of made together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice because not many people get to choose who they want as
their father. Usually you have to get stuck with the first guy that
you see. Fortunately for me, I had the luxury of choosing."</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding being typecast</TE>
<TE>   He also had plenty of professional choices in the wake of "Billy
Elliot's" worldwide success, but most of the projects pigeonholed
Bell.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately afterward, recalls Bell, "the scripts did swarm in
... but they were kiddie roles, American teen movies, all these
things that would typecast me as a child and my career would probably
be over by the time I'm 19. If I'd wanted to hugely capitalize on
'Billy Elliot,' I would have just jumped on the first thing I was
offered and play a kid again, but that was something I didn't want to
do -- I wanted to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Bell, who cites Leonardo DiCaprio and Eminem as role
models, first played a soldier in "Deathwatch," a ensemble drama set
in the trenches of World War I and scheduled for release next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been picking things slowly, trying to take something that
would sort of shatter the image of 'Billy Elliot.' In 'Deathwatch,'
people who know me as this dancing kid, now I'm going to be dodging
shrapnel and they'll be saying, 'What's he doing?' And they'll see
'Nicholas Nickleby' and, you know, just let 'Billy Elliot' go."</TE>

<KH>JAZZ REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A gift of sax and quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slightly belated but much appreciated Christmas present to fans of
straight-ahead jazz turned up at Spazio in Sherman Oaks on Thursday
in the performance of saxophonist Gary Foster with the David Sills
quartet.</LD>
<LD>   Foster is a veteran whose extraordinary talents tend to be applied
more often to his work as a studio player than to his sterling skills
as an improvising jazz musician. It was good, under any
circumstances, to hear him in action, playing something more
provocative than feature film cues.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, the circumstances were first-rate, since Foster
was surrounded by a fine ensemble. Sills is a gifted young tenor
saxophonist, the inimitable Tom Rainer was at the piano, and two
lesser known players -- bassist John Crooks and drummer Dean Koba --
provided solid rhythm-section support.</LD>
<TE>   The most immediate reference points in the set recalled the
fast-paced two-saxophone team of Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh in the
'50s. Playing Marsh's "Background Music" (based on the chords of "All
of Me") and Sills' "Sharkey" (on the chords of "Cherokee"), Foster
and Sills dashed through the rapidly twisting and turning melody
lines, diving into solos balancing rhythmic swing with melodically
intriguing improvisational explorations.</TE>
<TE>   Rainer took the spotlight with a solo opening chorus of "My
Foolish Heart," framing the familiar melody in spare but emotionally
potent harmonies. And "Friends Again," yet another revision of a
standard tune ("Just Friends," in this case) climaxed the set with a
brightly exuberant example of propulsive bebop.</TE>
<TE>   Call the program a comfortably reassuring holiday gift: no probing
avant-garde sounds, no edgy envelope-stretching; just imaginative,
engaging, timeless jazz at its finest.</TE>

<HD>Healthy networks need Saturday night fever</HD>
<DH>The golden eras of comedy might indeed be dead, but people
are out there waiting for good shows to watch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Noel Holston</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's probably not a TV critic around who hasn't banged out a
column bemoaning the lousy state of Saturday night TV.</LD>
<LD>   It's an evergreen topic, an easy layup, ideal for the dog days of
summer or the lull after a "sweeps" month. You can harrumph and
harangue with impunity. No viewer will disagree. How dare those
networks neglect a perfectly good night of the week? Why can't they
program Saturday night like they did in the 1970s? Archie and Edith.
Mary and Rhoda. Those were the days!</LD>
<LD>   I have done this myself, but not to worry: I'm not going to do it
again. This is an inquiry into what happened to Saturday night TV and
what, if anything, might be done to rejuvenate it.</LD>
<TE>   First off, it bears pointing out that although Saturday night has
often been more enticing than it is today, with its grab bag of
low-impact dramas ("Touched by an Angel," "The District"), movies,
movies, more movies and "Cops," it's not historically TV's big night.
It has a low HUT (homes using television) level because it's the
night people are most likely to go out.</TE>
<TE>   "The viewing level has always been a little lower on Saturday
night because of competing activities," says David Poltrack, CBS
Television's executive vice president for research and planning. "But
there were always shows on that night that were extraordinarily
well-received."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night indeed has been home to some highly successful
series over the decades. But the glorious critical mass that
prime-time Saturday attained in the mid-1970s, when "All in the
Family" and "The Carol Burnett Show" book-ended three hours of
peerless comedy, was only a fortunate coincidence. As Poltrack points
out, CBS eventually moved Archie Bunker and company to Sunday night,
when there's a larger audience available.</TE>
<TE>   For viewers old enough to recall it, that stretch of years when
the Bunkers anchored CBS' Saturday lineup is the yardstick by which
great nights of TV are measured, a grail to be regained. The 1973-74
roster in particular -- "All in the Family" followed by "MASH,"
followed by the Moore, Bob Newhart and Burnett shows -- is arguably
as close to a perfect slate of series a network has ever offered.</TE>
<TE>   Networks use a slightly different scoring system. Popular success
counts more than critical effusion. By their measure, the mid-1980s
NBC lineup anchored by "The Golden Girls" and "Hunter" was a Saturday
triumph, as was the early-'90s CBS schedule that included "Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman" and "Walker, Texas Ranger."</TE>
<TE>   But even during these debatably "golden" eras, series programming
in general on Saturday night was going downhill. There were scattered
hits, yes, but also fewer options offered by the broadcast networks.
The most popular series currently on Saturday night is CBS' "The
District," 39th in Nielsen's season-to-date tally. At least CBS has a
full series lineup. Fox contents itself with "Cops" and "America's
Most Wanted," low-budget shows whose audiences are small but
intensely loyal. ABC and NBC are back to running movies on Saturdays
for lack of a better plan. UPN and the WB leave Saturday nights to
their affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The culprits, if that's the right term, are cable, home video and
the preference of advertisers, and thus networks, for younger and
wealthier viewers. We are not all equal in the eye of CBS or any
other network. The young and the acquisitive are more prized. They
are also the most likely to go out or watch videos on Saturday
nights.</TE>
<TE>   You can see where this is going or, rather, where it's gone. Fewer
young adults watching broadcast TV on Saturday night led to fewer
broadcast options, which in turn led to fewer young adults watching,
which in turn led to, well, our choosing between "Touched by an
Angel" and subscribing to HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect this vicious circle to be broken soon. Saturday night
doesn't have the same strategic importance to advertisers as midweek
nights, especially Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Thursday night is a night when everyone wants to advertise to the
young, upper-socioeconomic audience," CBS' Poltrack says. "They're
planning their weekends, not just whether they're going to go to the
movies but whether they're going to go to the mall and buy the
high-definition television they've been wanting. People who are in
the market for automobiles tend to go to the showroom and look around
for cars on Saturday, so Thursday and Friday are when you want to get
that audience as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if the shows on Saturday night were to get the same ratings
as the shows that are currently on Thursday night get, just the fact
that they're on Saturday night would make them be less valuable,"
Poltrack says.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night may never regain its 1970s luster, but that's not
to say it won't ever get interesting again. Laura Caraccioli, vice
president and director of Starcom Entertainment, a Chicago ad agency,
sees Saturday night as "valuable real estate" the networks can't
afford to neglect.</TE>
<TE>   Caraccioli believes the broadcast networks will get serious about
Saturday night as soon as they've used up current inventories of
theatrical films that are unlikely to be replenished. With few
exceptions, theatricals are poor bargains nowadays. Almost any movie
of note has been seen on video or cable by most people who would care
to see it by the time it gets to broadcast TV.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Saturday night possibilities Caraccioli foresees:</TE>
<TE>   Inexpensive reality-based shows like the Learning Channel's
"Trading Spaces," which has illuminated a niche audience that a
broadcast network might enlarge.</TE>
<TE>   All sorts of "re-purposing": ABC might mix and match six sitcoms
from its midweek lineups on Saturday, or NBC might have its newly
acquired Bravo to schedule its Saturday night, much as Nickelodeon
programs CBS' Saturday mornings.</TE>
<TE>   Advertiser-produced programs, a return of sorts to the era of
"Philco Playhouse" and "G.E. Theater."</TE>
<TE>   Resurrected "franchises," an example of which would be NBC's
recent "Hunter" movie, almost certainly the first of a string.</TE>
<TE>   The key for the networks, Caraccioli says, is to calculate how
much advertising revenue they can expect to attract on Saturday night
and then develop programs that fit the environment and can turn a
profit. She's not sure what they'll do, but she's sure they'll do
something. "Saturday night is too valuable to abdicate to Blockbuster
video," she says.</TE>

<LD>Though its enfeebled state in recent years may make it hard to
believe, Saturday night over the decades has been home to some of
TV's most celebrated weekly shows. Here are 10 that made staying home
a joy. The parenthetical dates reflect the show's Saturday night
years only.</LD>
<LD>   1. "Your Show of Shows" (1950-54, NBC). Sid Caesar and his prime
time-ready players -- Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris -- set
the standard for sketch comedy in this legendary, live, 90-minute
show. Nobody since their heyday has done sharper movie and TV
parodies.</LD>
<LD>   2. "All in the Family" (1971-75, CBS). Norman Lear's brash,
politically aware sitcom about the blue-collar Bunkers of Queens
launched a prime-time revolution.</LD>
<TE>   3. "Gunsmoke" (1955-67, CBS). Marshal Matt Dillon left a long
trail of challengers in the dust, not just foolhardy gunslingers, but
rival shows.</TE>
<TE>   4. "The Cavalcade of Stars" (1949-50, DuMont) and "The Jackie
Gleason Show" (1952-57, CBS). Birthplace and proving grounds of "The
Honeymooners." The "classic 39" episodes that aired during the
1955-56 season were a self-contained Saturday night show.</TE>
<TE>   5. "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (1970-77, CBS). Had spunk. Unlike
Mary Richards' boss, Lou Grant, we loved spunk.</TE>
<TE>   6. "The Carol Burnett Show" (1972-77, CBS). Heiress to Caesar and
Gleason.</TE>
<TE>   7. "The Defenders" (1961-64). Forerunner of "The Practice" and
"Law &amp; Order," a lawyer drama that didn't run from touchy social
issues.</TE>
<TE>   8. "Mission: Impossible" (1966-67, 1970-72, 1973, CBS). Ritualized
espionage-adventure, the fastest-moving series of its time.</TE>
<TE>   9. "Get Smart" (1965-69, NBC). A deliciously silly spoof of 007
movies?</TE>
<TE>   10. "Perry Mason" (1957-62, CBS). Patron saint of the wrongly
accused.</TE>

<LD>WITH reference to Al Martinez's wrenching column about the man who
died because of an interminable delay getting through to a 911
operator ("When Death Walks By," Dec. 23): The phone companies have
developed so many clever devices that enhance the use of their
instruments, why couldn't dialing 911 automatically trace and record
the origin of the call?</LD>
<LD>   If found to be a nonemergency, the perpetrator could then be more
easily located and subjected to a $1,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   Widely publicized, this stratagem would have an immediate downward
effect on the number of irrelevant calls and free this vital service
for genuine emergencies.</LD>

<HD>Weighing the punk legacy of the Clash's Joe Strummer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THANKS for Robert Hilburn's appreciation of Joe Strummer of the Clash
("A Force in the World of Punk," Dec. 24). I'm a 34-year-old
singer-songwriter from East L.A. (whose only audience these days is
my 4-month-old daughter) and, any sentimentality aside, Joe Strummer
is the reason I picked up a guitar. I was influenced by Andy
Partridge, the Cocteau Twins, Woody Guthrie and Los Lobos, but I
wanted to write songs like Joe Strummer. He made it OK to write songs
that were angry and purposeful.</LD>

<TE>   IF the form of entertainment that we continue to call popular
music ever hit rock bottom, it was certainly with the sounds of punk
bands. How someone privileged to have his view printed in a major
newspaper can praise any punk noisemaker, dead or alive, defies my
imagination. What really galls is the concept of the "buzz-saw sound"
of punk being described as "serious reflection on politics and social
protest." The only thing good about the punk sound is that it drowned
out the inane, puerile lyrics of the Clash.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Patrick Goldstein's column ("Rudeness Wins All the
Marbles," Dec. 24): I've often thought what a wonderful city Los
Angeles would be if all those horrible little moguls, directors,
actors and wannabes packed their bags and left. Am I the only person
in this town rooting for runaway productions?</LD>

<TE>   I have long thought that much of the culture of rudeness in
Hollywood can be explained by this dictum: The entertainment business
sustains and defines itself by the conflict of ego, money, opinion
and talent, all relentlessly vying for control in an atmosphere of
adversity.</TE>

<LD>HOW gracious of New York producer Rocco Landesman to concede some
"moments that are moving" in the Taper's "Big River" while
pronouncing it "below Broadway's standards" and needing a "bigger
sound" ("This 'River' Is Surging Forward," by Don Shirley, Dec. 25).
But he thinks he can fix it. Whew! What a relief.</LD>
<LD>   Some things -- possibly Big Apple chutzpah -- never change, but
Broadway standards are not among them. Perhaps if Broadway and
Landesman would fret less over achieving "bigger sound" -- an irony
if ever there was one, given the dazzling, breakthrough dramatic
technique boldly and beautifully introduced in this production -- and
spend more time taking notes on how real entertainment is
communicated to an audience, he and Broadway could improve their
standards.</LD>

<LD>"The Merry Widow" on public television Dec. 25 was a glorious
production. Gorgeous singers, gorgeous singing, costumes, sets,
orchestra, musical tension, everything! Reviewer Chris Pasles just
didn't get it ("Despite the Music, 'Merry Widow' Barely Survives Its
Update," Dec. 25).</LD>
<LD>   I think it is the best production since the Elizabeth Schwarzkopf
versions of 50 years ago, and in some ways better. The translation
realized every nuance in blessedly understandable English. The stage
business, which Pasles called "shtick," such as the waiter tossing a
full tray to another waiter, told us what we should understand: This
is musical theater of the highest fun, beauty and art.</LD>

<DH>Kids at upscale preschools haven't embraced gambling or
botox. But some parents have -- in the name of fund-raising.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Van Nuys, couples wander through a faux Italian villa, tasting
$500 bottles of Merlot and learning much about olive oil. In Silver
Lake, folks at a dinner dance bid for walk-on roles on "Friends" and
"ER," for trips to Jamaica and New York. In Los Feliz, women peruse
racks of designer clothes and handbags, writing checks amid the
clatter of hangers and the bleat of cell phones.</LD>
<LD>   For those who have not yet received a personal invite, there's a
new notation on the collective social calendar -- the preschool
fund-raiser.</LD>
<LD>   With spring fairs and winter galas, sample sales, wine tastings,
rock concerts and film screenings, more and more preschools are
moving away from the traditional series of smaller revenue-generators
-- your candy sales, your gift-wrap drives -- in favor of one or two
blowout events. What with the inevitable presence of celebrity
parents at many schools and the increasing business acumen of the
volunteer-mommy base, these fetes have become more and more glamorous
and profitable.</LD>
<TE>   Barbara Davis probably doesn't have to worry about it cutting in
on the Carousel of Hope, but a dinner dance at the L.A. Athletic Club
and a silent auction complete with four-color catalog are a far cry
from hauling cookie dough door to door.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do this kind of thing in this town," says Pamela Ezell, a
mother of two who has helped put together the celebrity-studded
dinner-dance and silent auction for All Children Great and Small in
Los Feliz. "My sister lives in New Jersey, and her school has a
silent auction, but they also have to sell gift wrap and stuff,
which, fortunately, I have not had to do."</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot get behind Tupperware," says Michele Keeler, who has
done fund-raising for two schools now. "It takes too much time and
means bugging my friends when they are bugged beyond bug."</TE>
<TE>   But she will, and has, spent hours, months of hours, on the phone
begging for items for a silent auction or a sample sale. Parents
unwilling to spend their time organizing a rummage sale that might
gross $500 will dedicate three months of their lives to a glitzier
event that will bring in anywhere from $8,000 to $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   At many schools, most fund-raising dollars come from direct-appeal
campaigns -- parents are expected, or required, to make donations of
a certain amount. But despite tuitions that range from $5,000 to
$12,000 a year, it is the rare preschool that doesn't have at least
one other fund-raiser a year. Schools use the money in different ways
-- on supplies or field trips, scholarships or teacher bonuses.
Likewise, the level of parental involvement varies. Some schools,
especially cooperatives, require a certain number of hours served;
others rely on volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   For six hours on a recent breezy Saturday, Joanna Harper, whose
children attend the cooperative L.A. Family School in Silver Lake,
transformed her Los Feliz home into a boutique. The frontyard bloomed
with jewelry, wooden toys and a tent of richly hued rugs; inside,
there was designer clothing upstairs, downstairs and in my lady's
chamber. The school received 15% of the designers' sales, which
translated to about $5,500.</TE>
<TE>   "JCC, Hilltop, the Oaks, Children's Community," says Harper,
listing many of the local preschools in the area, "they're all doing
sample sales. Everyone likes them. The designers need to sell stuff;
everyone needs to buy stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Other area schools have branched out into money-raising events
usually reserved for the likes of Farm Aid. One has held concerts at
the Silver Lake club Spaceland. Another had a gala premiere for a
movie starring Elvira, a school parent.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrity-parent factor has long affected the sort of
fund-raisers certain schools have held. In 1949, when the newly
opened Westland School in Brentwood came up short, the director
turned to Charlie Chaplin, whose daughter was one of the school's
first students. He organized a benefit screening of "City Lights" and
invited a bunch of his friends, including the Marx Brothers.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 years later, many schools still count on industry
types to raise the glitz factor of their events. "We have parents who
have great jobs and great connections," says Ezell, who has worked
for several years on the silent auction at All Children Great and
Small, which raises from $25,000 to $30,000 annually. "Anthony
Edwards, for example, is a very involved alum parent, and his wife,
who runs Stila [Cosmetics], has been very generous."</TE>
<TE>   This year, in addition to the silent auction, there was a raffle
with trips to the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and five-star hotels in
Hawaii as prizes (both with airfare included). "We have producers who
shoot movies there," says Ezell, "and house the entire cast and crew.
So when they call asking for a few free nights, the hotels are pretty
happy to say yes."</TE>
<TE>   For Ezell, this kind of event is the only thing that makes sense
for a preschool. "It's inappropriate for kids this age to go
door-to-door, and parents don't have any time," she says.</TE>
<TE>   For almost a decade, the Early Years Preschool in Santa Monica has
kept its main fund-raising confined to two events a year -- a garage
sale and a dinner-dance with silent auction. Last year's dance was
held at Shutters, and one of the fathers, a "well-known songwriter,"
got some of his music industry buddies to play. "It's gotten a little
fancy," says co-director Tama Taub. The tickets were $80 a pop,
which, she says, is a bit of a problem. "Not everyone can afford
that. We're struggling a little with the event."</TE>
<TE>   Other schools say their fund-raising techniques remain as they
ever were. The director of the Center for Early Education in West
Hollywood says the school's annual auction and dinner-dance haven't
changed much in the last 16 years. Of course, the auction has
included such items as a home-cooked meal for 16 from Wolfgang Puck
and a round of golf with Michael Jordan. So it may simply be a
question of smaller schools playing catch-up.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, when Keeler enrolled her first child at L.A.
Family School, she was drafted into helping with the silent auction,
which typically brought in about $7,000. She started calling every
company she could think of -- airlines, hotels, department stores,
boutiques, clothing designers -- and asking for donated items. "I saw
Richard Tyler one day and thought, 'We should have a Richard Tyler
dress.' So I called and they were so nice, they donated a $3,500
dress."</TE>
<TE>   Her first auction made $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   When her children began attending Children's Community School in
Van Nuys, Keeler helped organize the main fund-raiser, a wine tasting
that came to include seminars on olive oil and raw vegetables,
separate stations for different varieties of wine and a huge silent
auction. Keeler called a friend who worked in the props department of
Universal Studios and transformed the school parking lot into an
Italian villa. The event raised close to $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured if we were going to do it," Keeler says, "we should do
it right."</TE>
<TE>   Although that sentiment has been shared by zealous volunteering
moms throughout the ages, the definition of "right" has clearly
changed. Because the moms have changed. And, with a few exceptions,
it is still mostly the moms who are making the calls and forming the
committees. But now many are in the midst of high-powered careers,
and even those who have taken a sabbatical have work experience that
led them away from the bake-sale table.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of professional women who may not be working at
this moment but who are used to running things a certain way," Ezell
says. "They have time and talent, but they aren't interested in using
it to make $250 when they could make $25,000."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the proliferation of the high-end silent auction
has created an air of competition. Parents rattle off the school with
the slickest auction catalog or the highest bidding, and many find
themselves vying for donors. Taub at Early Years says they start
soliciting much earlier these days because so many restaurants and
businesses get requests from so many schools. "Oh, they just groan
now," Harper says. "So you have to keep finding new sources."</TE>
<TE>   Many larger private schools have hired staff dedicated solely to
fund-raising projects. St. James Episcopal School in Mid-Wilshire
recently hired Theresa Maday as its development director. Maday
immediately upgraded the venue and the merchandise for the school's
spring dinner and silent auction -- last year's event netted
$110,000, compared with $40,000 in past years.</TE>
<TE>   The auction catalog alone, which is circulated a week or so before
the event, is one of those mentioned by parents at other schools.
"Our catalog is a big deal," Maday says. "We have one mom who has
been writing it so it's very funny, and people look forward to
getting it."</TE>
<TE>   Maday doesn't think anything St. James does in the fund-raising
department differs from what most private schools do. "Most schools
have been forced to put a development director on board because if
you have a tuition like ours [$9,500 a year], that's bargain-basement
prices, so you need to make ends meet with fund-raising."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she says, things haven't changed completely. At St. James,
as at every other school with a silent auction, the most popular and
profitable items are those made by the children or involving the
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Staff members will take a group of kids to the movies or to lunch
at Subway," Maday says. "You see the kids out to lunch with their
teachers, and they are just in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   And making a child principal for the day can go for two grand, she
says, but quickly adds, "which is nothing -- at other schools, that
alone will go for $10,000, $15,000."</TE>

<HD>Building on a visionary educator's dream</HD>
<DH>A new museum in Baltimore honors a pioneer's pluralistic
aesthetic and his eye for important artwork.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenn McNatt</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>In 1962, a Philadelphia artist named Paul Keene completed a large
abstract painting that he called "The Barrier." On the surface, the
painting closely resembled other works of the then-fashionable New
York school of Abstract Expressionism: nonrepresentational imagery
painted in a muscular, "all-over" style that emphasized the physical
act of putting pigments on canvas.</LD>
<LD>   But Keene was an African American painter, and almost hidden
within his seemingly abstract design was another powerful image: that
of black protesters being pummeled by water cannons at the height of
the civil rights struggle in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   When James E. Lewis, then chairman of the art department at Morgan
State University, saw the work later that year, he immediately
recognized its significance as an example of both advanced American
painting and of politically engaged African American art. Despite
limited funds, Lewis decided to purchase the work as a teaching tool
for his students.</LD>
<TE>   "The Barrier" thus became part of a collection that eventually
would grow to more than 4,000 objects by artists from all over the
world. Now it is on display again in a new museum named after Lewis.
Located in the university's Carl J. Murphy Fine Arts Center, which
was completed last year, the James E. Lewis Museum's first show
presents more than 200 artworks from the 16th century to the present,
including European and American painting, African sculpture,
installation, prints, drawing and photography.</TE>
<TE>   The museum and the collection it houses are a tribute to Lewis'
vision as a pioneering arts educator among the nation's historically
black colleges and universities. The artworks Lewis collected for the
school, almost all of the purchases made possible by gifts from
individuals and institutions, have helped educate generations of
Morgan fine arts graduates.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the museum from the beginning has been to provide
for the cultural enrichment of our students," said Gabriel S. Tenabe,
director of the museum and head of the fine arts department. "This
was Lewis' dream, and over the years we have been very successful in
building on what he started."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's holdings range from 17th century Dutch genre scenes
to works by Romantic, Impressionist and Modern masters. They include
works by Thomas Cole, John Constable, Jean Corot, Mary Cassatt, John
Singer Sargent and Salvador Dali as well as examples of such Harlem
Renaissance artists as Hale Woodruff, Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden
and Elizabeth Catlett.</TE>
<TE>   "Lewis had embarked on a lifelong endeavor to put together a
collection from a multicultural perspective," curator A.M. Weaver
said. "So the show is really held together by his pluralist
aesthetic."</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural show, titled "Convergence," highlights the close
relationship between European Modernism and a politically engaged
group of African American artists during the first half of the 20th
century who set out to redefine the terms of black identity in
America. Many of these artists had studied in Europe and returned to
the U.S. determined to apply what they had learned to the depiction
of African American life.</TE>
<TE>   The influence of African sculpture on Modernism also prompted
efforts to collect African art for its unique aesthetic qualities.
The Lewis museum houses an extensive collection of African masks,
sculpture and ceremonial objects that occupy pride of place in the
show.</TE>

<LD>Herb Ritts seemed to take the easy road to fame and fortune in the
field of photography: If you perfect your art and shoot pictures of
glamorous people whose images are in great demand, you can become
almost as big a star as your subjects.</LD>
<LD>   But it isn't quite that simple. While making exquisitely crafted
images of beautiful people plucked from the top rosters of movie
stars, rock stars, sports figures and supermodels, he plied a trade
in which rewards tend to be fleeting. Even the few celebrity
photographers who rise to the pinnacle attained by Ritts, who died
Thursday in Los Angeles, can have a tough time getting respect in
high art circles.</LD>
<LD>   He made the cut because his personal style and aesthetic
sensibility fit the temper of the times, critics and curators say.
While developing a distinctive body of work that carries on the
tradition of celebrity photography, he also took the art form in a
new direction.</LD>
<TE>   "He tapped into a certain changeover in celebrity -- from an
unattainable glamour or theatrical veneer to sensuality -- which was
beginning to happen when he started taking photographs," says Tim B.
Wride, associate curator of photography at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. As his career evolved, Ritts "actually defined that
changeover, and that made his subjects more accessible. By doing
that, he spawned a whole new generation of celebrity and art
photography."</TE>
<TE>   Ritts also won the admiration of his peers. "Doing what we do,
photographing personalities, you have to get them to drop their
guard," says Los Angeles photographer Greg Gorman. "Sometimes they
don't even know who they are, and it takes a photographer to draw
that out. Herb was very good at that."</TE>
<TE>   The bodies and faces Ritts pictured may appear ravishingly
beautiful, but "he had an ease and a kind of naturalness that flew in
the face of other celebrity photographers, for whom art direction was
the be-all, end-all," Wride says. "He used the medium of photography
with a seeming lack of artifice, a more natural sensuality." Ritts
photographed Richard Gere in the 1970s during a trip to the desert.
The images became iconic, propelling them both to fame. "Even in
those photos, you could see where he was coming from," Gere said
Friday. "He saw beauty everywhere. His pictures have that kind of
gentility about them."</TE>
<TE>   Another subject, Elizabeth Taylor, called Ritts "one of the most
brilliant photographers I've ever worked with."</TE>
<TE>   The first major museum exhibition of Ritts' work was held in 1996
at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, at the invitation of museum
director Malcolm Rogers. More than 250,000 visitors attended the show
of 230 celebrity portraits, fashion shots, images of Africa and
studies of the human form. It was a breakthrough for Ritts that
expanded the venerable institution's audience. His work also reached
a broad sector of the public through such books as "Notorious" and
"Africa." And specialists say his achievement isn't likely to be
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "His work is part of our collection," Wride says. "I would be
surprised if it weren't part of every major photo collection in the
country. It's emblematic of an era."</TE>

<HD>'Seussical' tips its hat to the small fry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ample populist enjoyment accompanies "Seussical: The Musical" at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Lynn Ahrens,
Stephen Flaherty and Eric Idle's much-maligned 2000 celebration of
Theodor Seuss Geisel's oeuvre receives a smoothly executed touring
production, its ensemble spearheaded by Cathy Rigby's irresistible
Cat in the Hat.</LD>
<LD>   Rigby's feline "host and emcee" seizes Segerstrom Hall with the
infectious opener, "Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!": "Take a tip from
the Cat / And hold onto your hat! / 'Cause this ain't Mother Goose! /
Think right over the brink / When you think about Seuss!"</LD>
<LD>   This paean to unbridled imagination, delivered by a cast packed
into a white cube, dotting James Kronzer's initial black-box setting,
establishes audience surrogate JoJo (Richard Miron, alternating with
Drake English).</LD>
<TE>   At the song's swelling finish, Cat and kid close the box, and
"Seussical" begins its journey.</TE>
<TE>   It starts in the Jungle of Nool, well delineated by Kronzer's set
pieces. The inhabitants are more suggestive than imitative, with
David Woolard's costume designs a delicious blend of thrift-store
chic and abstract cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Their wearers include the gospel-wailing Sour Kangaroo (Natasha
Yvette Williams); contrasting fowl Gertrude McFuzz (Garrett Long) and
Mayzie LaBird (Gaelen Gilliland); and, crucially, Horton the Elephant
(Eric Leviton).</TE>
<TE>   His travails dominate Ahrens and Flaherty's libretto. This
combines "Horton Hears a Who" and "Horton Hatches the Egg" with the
tale of would-be girlfriend Gertrude, plus snippets ranging from
"McElligot's Pool" to "Solla Sollew."</TE>
<TE>   Horton finds a clover blossom that houses the infinitesimal Whos,
depicted in Christopher Ashley's staging as pastel-clad suburbanite
mites. Chief among them is the Mayor (Don Stitt), Mrs. Mayor (Amy
Griffin) and their thinkaholic son, JoJo, who bonds with Horton in
the lovely ballad "Alone in the Universe."</TE>
<TE>   When a passing scavenger bird absconds with the clover, Horton's
mission of recovery is hindered by the petulant Mayzie. Desiring a
Florida vacation, she entices Horton into egg-sitting, which is where
Act 1 ends.</TE>
<TE>   Act 2 finds tree-dwelling Horton trapped in the Circus McGurkus,
with JoJo adrift in the starry miasma created by Howell Binkley's
exceptional lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley's direction is solid, as is Patti Colombo and John
Charron's choreography. Their contributions, along with Paul Rubin's
flying direction and the design factions, reach memorable peaks in
the airborne, black-lighted McElligot's Pool extravaganza and the
tickling Act 2 circus parade.</TE>
<TE>   The agile Rigby is wonderful company, carrying the proceedings
with ease of voice and person. Whether supplying wry one-liners while
shooting Silly String, nailing the vaudeville-styled "How Lucky You
Are" or changing personas at the drop of a hat, she is a genuine star
performer.</TE>
<TE>   Leviton's appealing Horton has an unforced directness and a clear
pop baritone. Long's Gertrude is both piquant and poignant, and
Gilliland's loopy Mayzie recalls the young Christine Ebersole.
Williams is a fierce soul sister, Miron a refreshingly unaffected
youngster, and their colleagues are all having a ball.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from audience reaction at the reviewed performance, so
will Who-sized viewers, though grown-up Grinches might be less
enchanted. Ahrens and Flaherty are the best songwriting team
currently working on Broadway, but their eclectic song palette here,
while charming, doesn't touch their Tony-winning "Ragtime" score.</TE>
<TE>   Some stylistic disarray seems inevitable, given Seuss's
idiosyncrasies and the show's hybrid of revue and musical -- a
revusical, perhaps. The overstuffed architecture lacks emotional
point, its balance torn between too many protagonists and ideas.
While such Seussian lifts as "A person's a person / No matter how
small" are admirable notions, they don't stand in for cogent form.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Seussical" is sure to delight the small, the tall may find
it less an original theater confection than an expertly appointed
theme-park attraction.</TE>

<HD>Gehry eyeing new project in Lisbon</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry is mulling over another project on
the Iberian Peninsula, where his famous, ship-like design for the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, is one of contemporary
architecture's greatest hits. But, contrary to an Associated Press
report that he had agreed "in principle" to design the renovation of
an 80-year-old theater district in Lisbon that has gone to seed,
Gehry said Friday that "there is no commitment on either side,
although it's the kind of project I would love to do."</LD>
<LD>   Gehry says a Lisbon deputy mayor and a project manager met with
him several weeks ago in Los Angeles to discuss plans for rebuilding
the area known as Parque Mayer. He will visit the district for the
first time in mid-January, stopping over in Lisbon on the way to
Jerusalem, where Gehry says his design for a new, privately funded
counterpart to L.A.'s Museum of Tolerance has been approved and the
next stage, making working drawings, is about to commence.</LD>
<LD>   According to Associated Press, Lisbon officials want to build two
modern theaters, a film complex, a museum, stores and offices on the
65,000-square-foot site. "I'm just going to see what they're up to.
If it's real, it's a wonderful project," said Gehry, whose latest
performance space, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, is nearing
completion in downtown L.A..</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by strong ratings for the Sci Fi Channel's miniseries, "Taken,"
ad-supported cable networks are drawing more viewers this month than
their broadcast network rivals, Variety reports. Collectively, 2.5
million more homes tuned to the cable networks than the seven
broadcast networks during the week ended Dec. 22.</LD>
<LD>   But cable's gains come during a season when its broadcast rivals
are serving primarily a diet of leftovers. Broadcasters served their
most toothsome fare -- lots of specials and fresh series episodes --
during the November sweeps period, when ratings determine how much
they can charge for advertising over the subsequent four months. In
December come the reruns.</LD>

<LD>The video for Justin Timberlake's new song, "Cry Me a River,"
features the 'N Sync singer videotaping a bedroom escapade with a
sexy brunet and making sure another woman -- who looks an awful lot
like Britney Spears -- sees it.</LD>
<LD>   But he's coy about whether this is a case of art imitating life.
He and Spears, 21, broke up this spring after dating for three years.</LD>
<LD>   The chorus of "Cry Me a River," which the 22-year-old co-wrote,
goes: "Told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone/Now you
tell me you need me when you call me on the phone."</LD>

<HD>Merkerson set to star in new play</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>S. Epatha Merkerson, who plays the no-nonsense New York cop, Lt.
Anita Van Buren, on "Law &amp; Order," is poised to become a modern-day
Hester Prynne in Suzan-Lori Parks' new play based on Nathaniel
Hawthorne's 1850 novel, "The Scarlet Letter."</LD>
<LD>   Quoting sources at New York's Public Theater, where performances
are scheduled to begin Feb. 25, the New York Times and Broadway.com
report that Merkerson is close to signing on as the lead -- a role
for which rapper-turned-actress Queen Latifah previously had been
mentioned as a candidate. Representatives of Merkerson and the
theater could not be reached Friday. Mos Def, who starred in Parks'
Pulitzer Prize-winning "Topdog/Underdog," also is in the cast.</LD>
<LD>   Merkerson's stage credentials include a 1990 Tony nomination for
her performance as Berniece in August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson" and
a 1992 Obie for "I'm Not Stupid," a play written by David E.
Rodriguez, a 17-year-old high school student.</LD>
<TE>   While the Public's production is billed as the world premiere,
Parks directed a small-theater run of her play in February 2000 at
Houston's DiverseWorks, an alternative performance space. The
director of the New York production will be Michael Greif, the former
La Jolla Playhouse artistic director known for directing the original
Tony-award-winning production of "Rent."</TE>

<LD>MTV, known for "The Real World" series, is ready to turn its cameras
on small town, USA.</LD>
<LD>   Producers of a new reality series, tentatively titled "Sex in the
Itty Bitty City," will hold auditions in Columbus, Miss., on Jan. 7;
Hope, Ark., on Jan. 9; and Opelousas, La., on Jan. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The documentary-style show will feature women 18 to 30 years old
who are looking for a husband. It is scheduled to air in late April.
"We want young women who are outgoing, women with lots of personality
with nothing to hide," producer Craig D'Entrone said. "We want women
who don't mind telling their whole story, and don't mind having it
videotaped."</LD>
<TE>   D'Entrone said the show will have the feel of HBO's "Sex and the
City" but "with real life and in a small town."</TE>

<HD>In disaster, he found his voice</HD>
<DH>The 'singing cop' who performed at funerals of Sept. 11
victims is building a music career.</DH>

<LD>You might not remember his name, but last year Daniel Rodriguez put
his arms around America and dried its tears with his voice.</LD>
<LD>   He is the "singing cop," the New York City police officer who sang
at the funerals of those claimed by the attacks on the World Trade
Center. He sang at the World Series. He sang at the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade. He sang at the Rockefeller Center Christmas
tree-lighting ceremony. He sang, and sang again, "God Bless America"
and "The Star-Spangled Banner." Old Glory fluttered in the breeze
whenever and wherever he sang.</LD>
<LD>   Although his press biography says he is on leave from the New York
Police Department, Rodriguez says, "I'm not going back." Things have
taken off for him. He's done more than 45 concerts this year and is
booked for twice as many next year. He played the White House last
March.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, "Daniel Rodriguez, the Spirit of America," his
debut CD, came out. The album includes "God Bless America," "America
the Beautiful" and "We Will Go On," the single he released a year ago
this month. Rodriguez has an agent.</TE>
<TE>   He's being mentored by Placido Domingo and his associates at the
Washington Opera Company. They are teaching him how to produce,
enhance and protect his voice. Domingo and Rodriguez sang at a
memorial service at Yankee Stadium 12 days after the World Trade
Center towers were attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Domingo, Rodriguez says, thinks he has the talent to be "another
him." Rodriguez laughs at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, 38, punctuates his sentences with laughter. If he
weren't a singer, he says, he'd be a comedian. "I am exactly where I
always wanted to be," Rodriguez says.</TE>
<TE>   As the gospel song says, he's come this far by faith. "In my life,
it's been my faith that has gotten me through tough times," he says.</TE>
<TE>   At 19, he became a father. His first marriage failed. During the
bleakest years, there were times he didn't sing at all.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he failed miserably at an audition at the
Metropolitan Opera that former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a
friend, had helped arrange. A man Rodriguez would not name stopped
him just as he began to sing "La Donna E Mobile" from "Rigoletto."
Rodriguez remembers the man saying that a cop who sang was
incongruous to him. "So what makes you think a New York City police
officer can sing opera?" the man asked.</TE>
<TE>   The man didn't understand, Rodriguez says: "I wasn't a cop who
sang, I was a singer who became a policeman."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez had been singing all his life. As a teenager, he worked
with Elliot Dorfman, a Juilliard-trained teacher. Dorfman trained
Rodriguez as a baritone, thinking he'd face less competition than
would a tenor. It was like pointing a kid toward being a baseball
catcher to better his odds of making it to the major leagues,
Rodriguez says.</TE>
<TE>   At 17, he performed as a baritone at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital
Hall. But the tenor always needed a way to support himself.</TE>
<TE>   He worked just to put money in his pocket and food on the table,
including a stint at the post office.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Police Department looking for a steady paycheck but
found a career. He sang at his graduation from the police academy in
1996 and quickly became one of the department's official singers.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has appeared on the "Today" show. He's lost about 25
pounds since last year. He's married, to Ginamarie, and has a
daughter, Jai-Lisa, 12. He's living on New York's Staten Island. His
older child, Daniel, is in college. There are so many blessings,
Rodriguez says. Nevertheless, Rodriguez says he knows that some view
him as a novelty act whose fame exceeds his talent.</TE>
<TE>   While he is eager to see how far his talent takes him, Rodriguez
says he doesn't want to "be a rock star or a millionaire." He
believes his real success is finding something he loves and doing it.</TE>

<LD>The fact that "we have no tradition is our best hope."</LD>
<LD>   So wrote the great Pasadena designer, ceramicist and teacher
Ernest A. Batchelder in an essay first published in a 1907 issue of
Gustav Stickley's influential Craftsman magazine. The plural pronoun
in Batchelder's bold, even paradoxical boast was meant to describe
what was then occurring around him, as California's astonishing
natural beauty and absence of calcified social conventions combined
to stimulate a unique aesthetic moment.</LD>
<LD>   Up and down the state, artists, artisans and architects animated
by the spirit of the international Arts and Crafts movement and
responding to a natural setting that seemed, to them, exotic and
moving created a renaissance of domestic architecture and decorative
art.</LD>
<TE>   On an even earlier visit to California, Stickley himself had found
the landscape a "bewildering scene of color," one he thought
blessedly free from the "demoralizing influence of the classic
formula of the art successes of other nations."</TE>
<TE>   A year after Batchelder's essay was published, the internationally
prominent English architect and designer Charles R. Ashbee traveled
to Pasadena, where Charles Sumner Greene took him on a daylong tour
of the houses he and his brother were constructing. Later they took
tea on the family's terrace overlooking the arroyo, and Ashbee
watched the snowcapped San Gabriels turn "rose red." As he later
wrote, "California speaks. Here things were really alive."</TE>
<TE>   Batchelder notwithstanding, the expression of such sentiments is a
California tradition. In his wonderfully propulsive new biography --
"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire,"
published this month by Hill and Wang -- historian Tom Chaffin
describes how the herald of Manifest Destiny experienced this place
after his party's savage winter crossing of the Sierra Nevada:</TE>
<TE>   "By late March of 1844, spring lay robustly abloom down the length
of California's Central Valley ... a riot of orange California
poppies, deep blue lupines, bird's-eye gilia, and countless other
wild flowers." As Fremont himself wrote, "Our road was now one
continued enjoyment; and it was pleasant riding among this assemblage
of green pastures with varied flowers and scattered groves, and out
of the warm green spring, to look at the rocky and snowy peaks where
lately we had suffered so much."</TE>
<TE>   A little more than half a century later, in 1911, the Harvard
philosopher George Santayana told a Berkeley audience that he saw
emerging in California a new sort of American inspired by "your
forest and your sierras" whose "nonhuman beauty and peace ... stir
the subhuman depths and the superhuman possibilities of your own
spirit."</TE>
<TE>   California was a place, Santayana mused, where open-minded
Americans might follow the lead of his colleague William James and
give "a sincerely respectful hearing to sentimentalists, mystics,
spiritualists, wizards, cranks, quacks and impostors."</TE>
<TE>   And so they did.</TE>
<TE>   And that, coupled with the global trauma of World War I, changed
everything. High-mindedness and spirituality gave way to fantasy and
spiritualism; the progressive taste for reform in politics and daily
life was supplanted by an appetite for pleasure. This was the era in
which Californians imagined an idyllic Hispano-Mediterranean past and
"Spanish revival" architecture became the "regional style."</TE>
<TE>   Stockbroker-turned-architect George Washington Smith designed
Santa Barbara's great Casa del Herrero for St. Louis businessman
George F. Steadman. The young Wallace Neff built a sprawling "Spanish
Colonial" rancho in Calabasas for King C. Gillette, inventor of the
disposable razor blade.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing before or since trumped the collaboration among
publisher William Randolph Hearst -- a kind of multimedia Medici,
really -- the architect Julia Morgan and the young engineer and
builder George Loorz. Their work together on the so-called castle at
San Simeon, at Wintoon (the Hearst family compound in Northern
California), along the Grand Canyon and in Mexico is illuminated as
never before in a remarkable new book, "Building for Hearst and
Morgan: Voices from the George Loorz Papers" by the independent
scholar and archivist Taylor Coffman.</TE>
<TE>   As the incisive introduction by Kevin Starr points out, this
volume, available this week from Berkeley Hills Books, is really a
581-page work of social history in which the vast correspondence that
passed between and among this trio is meticulously edited into a
densely factual but engaging narrative. More important, the human
voices of the great patron, the fascinating architect and the
plain-spoken, likable young engineer who oversaw their sprawling
construction projects emerge as they never quite have before.</TE>
<TE>   Making that happen involved years of research through tens of
thousands of documents in four major archives, including one still in
private hands, and particularly through Loorz's previously
unpublished papers.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman assembled all the material into chronological order, and
"in doing that, all sorts of connections came out," he said.
"Somebody writes to somebody else, then here's the answer. A whole
story all to itself was there for the telling."</TE>
<TE>   Coffman describes himself as "frankly a Hearst partisan, though I
am well aware of his personal failings and eccentricities. But he had
a hugely expansive mind and the money to let it roam where it would.
But what pleases me most about this book is that its technique allows
Julia Morgan to emerge as a real person for the first time in print."</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true, Coffman said, in the letters she wrote
to Loorz's children and in the correspondence Hearst, Morgan and
their construction supervisor exchanged concerning the beauty of
their Central Coast and Northern California sites. Morgan, in
particular, wrote frequently to Hearst about San Simeon, saying,
"This is a gorgeous place and we have to do right by it."</TE>
<TE>   Opinions differ on whether or not they did. San Simeon -- or
Hearst's Castle, as it is more frequently known -- is part pastiche,
part historical collage, part act of recovery, part a work of
extravagant imagination. Among its prime movers, Morgan was certainly
the most enigmatic: She was, by turn, the only woman in her Berkeley
class of 1894 to graduate with a degree in engineering, protegee to
the great San Francisco architect Bernard Maybeck, the first woman
ever to study architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the
first woman licensed to practice architecture in California, and the
designer of more than 800 buildings, who gave years of her life to
the collaborations with Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike her contemporaries, she published nothing, maintaining a
deep reticence until her death in 1957. "My buildings will be my
legacy," she said in a rare public comment. "They will speak for me
long after I'm gone."</TE>
<TE>   They do. But so too in a very unexpected way does "Building for
Hearst and Morgan."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hi, my name is Jim, and I drive an SUV.</LD>
<LD>   Hi, Jim.</LD>
<LD>   Hi. Umm, this is my first meeting of SUV Owners Anonymous, and I'm
a little nervous.</LD>
<TE>   Don't be, Jim, we're all the same here, we've all experienced the
loathing, the obscene gestures, the other drivers making eye contact
and mouthing the word "die."</TE>
<TE>   Really? So people hate all of you as much as they hate me?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, I wouldn't go that far, Jim, but ... why don't you tell us
your story.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, sure.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, well, I bought my SUV three years ago, and I was hooked
right away. I loved the rugged styling, the big engine, the
four-wheel drive, the glass all around and the way you looked down on
everyone else. But you know what mattered the most to me? Size.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, I can see there might have been some kind of
repressed sexual thing going on.</TE>
<TE>   I say this because, at the time, I was having a recurring dream in
which this beautiful woman asks me what kind of SUV I drive, and I
tell her a Crown Viagra.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway.</TE>
<TE>   I thought I owned the road. I was always speeding and tailgating
and cutting people off. And I'd never signal because, hey, only the
little people signal.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I was once a psycho suburban road warrior, and getting
crazier all the time. It got to the point where I wouldn't even
associate with anyone who got more than 10 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a few weeks ago, I hit rock-bottom.</TE>
<TE>   It was snowing out, and I was sitting in traffic fuming because
some subcompact up ahead didn't have the traction to make it over a
speed bump.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, I found myself seriously thinking -- and I mean
seriously thinking -- about dropping it into four-wheel and
off-roading it over a half-dozen or so manicured lawns to get around
the backup.</TE>
<TE>   I see several of you nodding, so you know what it took to beat
back that impulse. Afterward, shivering in the chilled shadows of a
cold sweat, I had a major revelation: As an SUV owner, I belonged to
a club that would have me as a member.</TE>
<TE>   So, I guess that's my story. I'm just trying to take it slow now,
not looking too far down the road, and trying to stay out of the
passing lane one day at a time. Thanks for listening.</TE>
<TE>   (Applause.)</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Jim, I know that was difficult. Just one thing, we
usually like a speaker to tell everyone how long it has been since
they last drove an SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Geez, I'm not sure. How long have I been here?</TE>

<HD>'TV Tales' recounts how 'Angels' earned its wings</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a shooting-star phenomenon, a dolled-up piece of TV fluff that
flounced its way into ratings history before the wild surge
eventually crested and fell back.</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Charlie's Angels," based on a concept so flimsy that its
success astounded even its creators, still stalks the American
consciousness. A knockoff theatrical release spawned two decades
after the show's cancellation was box-office gold, a sequel is on the
way and, Sunday night at 8, the E! Network comes up with an
exhaustive, if also a bit exhausting, two-hour bone-picking of the
original series on the cable outfit's "TV Tales."</LD>
<LD>   It helps that the special is as much an examination of the
fickleness of pop culture as of the show itself. When executive
producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg hit upon the idea of
casting three women as action-series leads in 1975, it was a sex-role
innovation for the times but, without another piece of the puzzle, it
might have fallen flat.</LD>
<TE>   Although the 90-minute pilot that aired March 21, 1976, was a huge
hit, it was the release of the famous bathing-suit poster of one of
the three series principals, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, several weeks
later that kick-started the show's fall premiere and helped
"Charlie's Angels" finish as the season's No. 1 show.</TE>
<TE>   Fawcett-Majors left fellow Angels Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith
after that first season, setting in motion the revolving-door casting
that gradually eroded the show's glitz, and all involved weigh in
quite candidly here on what it was like to ride the rocket.</TE>
<TE>   Sniffs Smith to critics of the show: "Uh, it wasn't meant to be
Shakespeare."</TE>

<LD>If you've been looking for a 2003 calendar, perhaps you already
suspected this: There are more calendar themes than years on the AD
calendar.</LD>
<LD>   Publishers produced about 3,000 calendar varieties this year,
offering everything from an ode to outhouses to a celebration of
witchcraft featuring all the major Wiccan holidays.</LD>
<LD>   The proliferation of choices reflects the evolution of a
$550-million retail industry that didn't amount to much until a
whimsical family business called BrownTrout Publishers Inc. began
making specialty calendars on a lark in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   Since selling about 30,000 calendars that first year, BrownTrout
has grown into a big fish in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The San Mateo, Calif., company says it has sold 12 million
calendars this year, enabling it to stake a claim as the nation's
largest publisher of calendars sold by retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "They have really taken things to another level," said Hillel
Levin, general manager of Calendars.com, a major online merchant
partially owned by book store giant Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "They've become a powerhouse because they really excel at finding
niches that people have a passionate interest in," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   BrownTrout's 2003 calendars have accounted for more than $100
million in retail sales. As a wholesaler, BrownTrout makes much less
than that. The privately held company says its annual revenue is
about $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   There are other calendar heavyweights, including Andrews McMeel
and Workman Publishing Co., but none can match BrownTrout's depth of
selections.</TE>
<TE>   Including titles released under other labels, BrownTrout this year
produced more than 900 calendar themes, up from about 500 varieties
just five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   It took a 283-page catalog to list all the company's 2003
calendars. In 1986, the company put out a one-page flier to promote a
modest selection of three calendars devoted to Florida, Idaho and
Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a noun, there is a good chance that we have a calendar
devoted to it," said Wendover H. Brown, who runs BrownTrout with her
husband, Marc, and his twin brother, Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Most of BrownTrout's calendar themes are prosaic. Animal-themed
calendars account for about 40% of the company's sales, which
explains why there are 240 dog calendars in BrownTrout's 2003
catalog.</TE>
<TE>   With online sales making it easier to connect with niche
audiences, BrownTrout has been branching into ever more eclectic
themes, including its popular outhouse tribute that offers meditative
thoughts such as, "When nature has work to be done, she creates a
genius to do it."</TE>
<TE>   As quirky as it is, the outhouse calendar may not be the oddest
ever produced by BrownTrout.</TE>
<TE>   The company's other esoteric efforts include calendars devoted to
jackasses, lawn mowers and erotica in Renaissance art. BrownTrout
even found enough material to fill a 2003 calendar called "Wild and
Scenic New Jersey."</TE>
<TE>   Retailers have responded to the rising calendar demand by opening
more temporary stores devoted to the products.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-year-old Calendar Club this year operated more than 1,000
stores, mostly in malls, from October through December. About 40% of
calendars are sold between Thanksgiving and Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   The breadth of calendars in today's market even surprises the
Browns, self-described "children of the '60s" just looking for
something that would help pay the bills when they decided to try
making wilderness calendars in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Avian Virus Surfaces in Egg Industry</HD>
<DH>Officials destroy more than 100,000 chickens in Southern
California in an effort to prevent the spread of exotic Newcastle
disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An outbreak of a rare poultry disease -- harmless to humans but fatal
to birds -- has shown up in the state's commercial egg industry,
forcing state officials to destroy more than 100,000 hens at a
Riverside County ranch and heightening fears that it could spread to
major livestock operations in Central California.</LD>
<LD>   A team of state and local officials began destroying the hens last
weekend after tests revealed that some were infected with exotic
Newcastle disease, a highly contagious viral disorder that can kill
birds without warning, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Larry
Hawkins said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 100,000 birds destroyed in Riverside County constitute a small
fraction of the 280 million chickens and turkeys on commercial farms
in California. But the fact that the virus has crossed over into
commercial poultry production has the $3-billion industry scrambling
to adopt stricter safety standards.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't afford to let it move north of the Tehachapis, into the
largest poultry-growing area of the state," said Bill Mattos,
president of the California Poultry Federation, which represents 160
producers.</TE>
<TE>   He said Central Valley ranchers, who raise nearly all of the
state's meat birds and 40% of its eggs, are "concerned, with capital
letters. If it gets into a commercial area in Fresno, that could be
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   The spreading disease -- first spotted Sept. 27 in a flock of
backyard chickens in Compton -- also has cast a pall over U.S. trade
relations. Only 2% of the industry's revenue comes from overseas
sales. But Mexico, which buys 40% of the exports, already has barred
California poultry and eggs because of the outbreak, Mattos said, as
have some Far East countries such as Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "The big economic risk is of domestic trading partners and foreign
trading partners imposing sanctions against California, or against
the entire United States, as a result of having the disease here,"
said Hawkins, the USDA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic Newcastle, for which there is no vaccine, affects all kinds
of fowl, including ducks, geese and pigeons. It causes flu-like
symptoms in birds, including sneezing, coughing and diarrhea. The
last time the virus hit the state's poultry industry was in the early
1970s, when 12 million chickens had to be destroyed at a cost of more
than $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The disease took almost three years to eradicate.</TE>
<TE>   At Foster Farms in Livingston, there's been no incident of
Newcastle because of the strict safety measures Foster uses to raise
table-bound chickens, said Randy Boyce, a company vice president.
Todd Beal, director of quality assurance for Zacky Farms of South El
Monte, which now raises turkeys exclusively, said the company is
"worried, but we maintain a very strict bio-security program."</TE>
<TE>   After the outbreak began showing up in backyard birds in Southern
California, state and federal officials imposed quarantines on all of
Los Angeles County and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. Inspectors searched nearly 4,200 backyards and have
destroyed 40,000 birds at 1,043 homes, government records show.</TE>
<TE>   The quarantine also covered about 100 commercial ranches, part of
a Southern California poultry sector that produces 60% of the state's
eggs from an estimated 9 million hens.</TE>
<TE>   The situation escalated when the owner of an egg ranch in western
Riverside County contacted authorities about an "unusual mortality in
his flock." Tests last weekend confirmed exotic Newcastle.</TE>
<TE>   The crossover of the disease into the commercial sector prompted
conference calls between poultry producers and state and federal
agriculture officials this week, according to Mattos.</TE>
<TE>   He said the industry is urging all producers to enact stricter
health protocols for the chicken ranches. Those include forbidding
visitors to poultry farms and requiring all personnel to have their
clothes disinfected.</TE>
<TE>   The goal: Keep exotic Newcastle bottled up in Southern California,
then eradicate it.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry's very concerned about what's happening, and that's
why the bio-security is going to be stepped up even more, even if we
can have the government get involved in a legal sort of way," Mattos
said. "This is very serious."</TE>

<HD>3 Money-Transfer Firms Offer Plaintiffs Discounts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deborah Kong</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican immigrants who sued money-transfer companies for allegedly
charging them hidden transaction fees soon will be able to receive
modest discounts from the companies.</LD>
<LD>   Class-action suits against the companies -- First Data Corp.
subsidiaries Western Union Financial Services Inc. and Orlandi
Valuta, and MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Viad
Corp. -- alleged that they collected hidden charges for years from
customers sending money from the United States to Mexico. The
companies also were accused of failing to clearly disclose the
charges in their ads.</LD>
<LD>   The suits were settled two years ago. But as many as 5 million
plaintiffs who used the companies to send funds to Mexico from about
1987 to 1999 have not received benefits because of legal wrangling.
Claim forms now are being mailed out.</LD>
<TE>   Those who sign the forms will get a choice of two $4.25 coupons or
one $6 coupon for each transaction between 1993 and 1999. Customers,
who can use one coupon per future transaction, can get another coupon
for every 10 transactions before 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The total value of the coupons is about $375 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good settlement," said Luis Pelayo, a plaintiff who has
been sending money to his parents since he arrived in the United
States and began working as a dishwasher 21 years ago. "Very poor
people were being ripped off."</TE>
<TE>   Pelayo said he and others didn't know about the foreign exchange
charge -- the difference between the foreign exchange rate firms
charge customers and the more favorable, wholesale rate they pay for
pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Western Union has maintained that forms customers filled out to
send money had adequate disclosures. Spokesman David Banks said
Western Union also added a more explicit explanation of the exchange
rate fee after the suit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   "This afforded us the opportunity to make some additional
disclosures in the form, to be a good corporate citizen here and to
make things even more clear to our customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   MoneyGram never intended to misleadingly advertise, said
spokeswoman Angela Phoenix. It already has changed its ads to more
clearly explain the exchange rate fee, as required by the settlement,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also awards about $10 million in plaintiffs'
attorneys fees, to be split among a team of lawyers from eight firms.</TE>

<HD>CPK Duo Seek to Top Pizza</HD>
<DH>The two will put up most of the money to launch a
$2.1-million bar and grill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The men who brought you barbecue chicken pizza will launch a new
restaurant concept next spring, aiming to gobble up an even larger
slice of the "casual-dining" pie.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield -- former law partners who in 1985
launched California Pizza Kitchen in a Beverly Hills storefront so
small that the refrigerator wouldn't fit -- will break ground next
month on a grill and bar restaurant in a Manhattan Beach shopping
center.</LD>
<LD>   Called LA Food Show, the $2.1-million restaurant is set to open in
mid-May with a 50-item menu including burgers, steaks, pasta and
alcohol -- but no pizza. And it will be bankrolled primarily by the
two founders, an unusual strategy in the restaurant business. Los
Angeles-based California Pizza Kitchen Inc., with nearly 150 units
and its own aggressive growth plans, will own a minority share.</LD>
<TE>   Although California Pizza Kitchen has no contractual obligation to
eventually buy LA Food Show, it does have the right of first refusal,
a spokeswoman said. And it will be the only investor outside of the
two founders.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our vision that the companies would one day unite," said
Flax, 60.</TE>
<TE>   The two men, who in November each sold 340,000 shares of CPK stock
at about $24 each to help finance the new eatery, said the financing
scheme should help keep California Pizza Kitchen focused on its own
growth trajectory. The company, which reported record revenue of
nearly $250 million last year, has announced plans to add at least 22
stores in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to see CPK distracted from developing CPK," said
Rosenfield, 57. "At the same time, Larry and I want to let our
creative senses flow again."</TE>
<TE>   Added Flax: "There's no question that to become a multibillion- or
billion-dollar company we are going to need other concepts. Since
we're going to have to bring in new concepts eventually, we might as
well go out and start it instead of buying it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's an unusual tactic in the restaurant business, where
established chains nationwide are scrambling to cook up new brands in
the "casual-dining" segment -- a niche just south of fine dining but
still north of the local burger joint.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in most cases, acquisition is the route that companies
take as they branch out. Dallas-based Brinker International Inc., for
example, began life as Chili's Grill &amp; Bar and within half a dozen
years had purchased the On the Border and Corner Bakery Cafe chains.</TE>
<TE>   "Most chains are buyers," said John M. Hamburger, president of the
firm that publishes the Restaurant Finance Monitor. "It's easier to
see something work and buy it."</TE>
<TE>   A significant exception is Orlando, Fla.-based Darden Restaurants
Inc. -- the largest casual-dining restaurant company in the world,
with $4 billion in sales. Darden, which runs the Red Lobster and
Olive Garden chains, launches nearly all new concepts internally
after months of study, analysts said. Darden recently announced plans
to debut its own bar and grill, called Seasons 52.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shepardson, president of Orlando-based CNL Advisory
Services, an investment bank that specializes in the restaurant
sector, praised Flax and Rosenfield's plan for getting LA Food Show
up and running.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's environment, where you have one minor misstep and the
market slams you," Shepardson said, "this appears to be a prudent way
to approach the development of a new brand without putting
shareholders at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Flax and Rosenfield describe their new production as a dinner
house with a display kitchen, where the setting is more marble than
linoleum and where the bar is more waiting area than destination. The
average check is expected to be about $15 per person -- some $4 more
than at California Pizza Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The duo, no longer active in the daily management of the pizza
chain, insist there will be no head-on competition with their
firstborn. "We crafted the new concept to be complementary,"
Rosenfield said. "We're going to give you what you're not in the mood
for at CPK."</TE>
<TE>   The first of what is hoped will be a chain of Food Shows will cost
about 10 times the $200,000 the two borrowed in 1984 to launch Pizza
Kitchen. That store, with about 1,800 square feet, was so small that
the owners used refrigeration trucks parked in the back to keep food
cold until they found a way to shoehorn refrigeration units into the
back.</TE>
<TE>   LA Food Show will be about 7,000 square feet, 40% larger than the
typical California Pizza Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of the Pizza Kitchen launch, Rosenfield and Flax
scrambled to find outside investors as costs soared. The company went
public in August 2000, netting more than $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   Since its initial $15 bow on Wall Street, the share price has
nearly doubled. The stock lost $1.08 on Friday to $25.32 on Nasdaq,
down from its 52-week high of $28.03 on Oct. 28 but up 42% from its
52-week low of $17.85.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, the company posted net income of $13.2 million, or 71
cents a share. Net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 29 was $3
million, or 16 cents a share, down from $3.4 million, or 18 cents, in
the year-earlier period, partly because of the closure of two
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Craig T. Weichmann, who heads a Memphis, Tenn.-based financial
advisory firm, likened the Food Show rollout to a "test kitchen" and
said he expects others in the industry to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Large companies are now trying to figure out how they can be
involved in the launch stage to take a little bit of money and
earmark it toward development to gain a future benefit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenfield has his own analogy. "We're like producers," he said.
"We want to see if there's another hit in us."</TE>

<HD>Sales of New Homes Set a Record in November</HD>
<DH>Low mortgage rates help keep the housing sector strong in
an uncertain U.S. economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of new homes surged 5.7% to a record in November, the
government said Friday in a report that defied expectations that the
booming housing market would take a breather. Sales in the West,
however, fell 3.9%.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of newly built homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.07 million units from an upwardly revised 1.01 million in
October.</LD>
<LD>   The number trounced forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters, who
expected an even 1 million annual rate.</LD>
<TE>   Housing has remained strong in the uncertain U.S. economy as low
mortgage rates, coupled with moribund stock markets, have enticed
Americans to invest in bricks and beams.</TE>
<TE>   The popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 6% in November,
a level not seen since the mid-1960s, according to home financing
giant Freddie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four months, new-home sales have posted their four
highest rates ever.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the data reflected a mature market that probably
would ease in coming months as interest rates go up with a rebounding
U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing sector is one of the few shining points right now --
all the other news has been relentlessly bleak," said John Shin, an
economist at Lehman Bros. "Housing is holding up the economy, but you
wonder how long it can go on."</TE>
<TE>   Also, a decline in median sales prices suggests that builders are
giving discounts or trimming profit margins to help sustain sales,
economists said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons why they're keeping demand up is either
builders are building cheaper homes or builders are taking a bit of
their profit to keep activity going," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief
U.S. economist for ABN Amro.</TE>
<TE>   The median sales price for a new home fell to $167,300 from
$168,100 in November a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   There were wide regional swings in sales last month.</TE>
<TE>   While the Midwest was at a high with a rise of 41.2%, sales in the
Northeast plunged 26.7%, which followed a 36.8% drop in October.</TE>
<TE>   November sales in the Northeast were at the lowest level since

<HD>Enron's Ex-Treasurer Is Subject of Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben F. Glisan Jr. has been told by
prosecutors that he is a subject of investigation for possible
criminal charges in the energy company's collapse, court papers made
public Friday say.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department has been investigating several
Enron-related off-the-books partnerships used to hide $1 billion in
losses.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have been trying to seize Glisan's bank account
containing $916,137 that they say contains ill-gotten gains from a
partnership called Southampton. Enron's December 2001 bankruptcy
filing is the second-largest in U.S. history.</LD>
<TE>   Glisan wants court proceedings over the account halted because
otherwise his "right against self-incrimination in the related
criminal investigation will be burdened," his lawyers said in court
papers.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Glisan has been informed by the Enron task force that he is a
subject of that criminal investigation," wrote Glisan's lawyers in
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   And Henry F. Schuelke III, one of Glisan's lawyers, didn't return
a phone call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Southampton was a partnership through which former Enron Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former executive Michael Kopper
and four other Enron employees received payments from LJM1, a
partnership set up to buy and hold Enron assets, according to a
report by a special committee of Enron's board.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Glisan said he wanted to return almost $629,000 of the
$1.04 million he received from a $5,800 investment in the Southampton
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   In that court filing, he maintained his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I consent to this payment despite my honest belief that I was an
innocent owner of that money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Glisan said he decided to turn in the money after reviewing
documents related to criminal charges against Fastow and Kopper.</TE>

<HD>Liberate Fires Operating Chief, Will Restate Results</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberate Technologies Inc. fired Chief Operating Officer Donald M.
Fitzpatrick on Friday, saying the termination resulted from an
ongoing internal investigation into questionable accounting.</LD>
<LD>   The San Carlos, Calif.-based company, which makes software for
television set-top boxes, in November placed Fitzpatrick on leave
after launching an inquiry into the "appropriateness and timing" of
$10 million in revenue in the 15 months leading up to Aug 31.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the company fell 4 cents to $1.42 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   Liberate said Chief Executive Mitchell E. Kertzman, who planned to
scale back his responsibilities at the end of the month, would remain
in his current role until the company restates its results.</TE>
<TE>   Citing "the need to conduct a thorough investigation of the
facts," Liberate did not estimate when it would release the corrected
results.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Liberate said its internal audit committee began
investigating a $1.84-million software licensing deal in October. But
the probe turned up other questionable transactions that could cause
the company to restate up to 10% of its revenue since mid-2001. It
subsequently placed Fitzpatrick, who oversaw the company's sales
operations, on leave. Fitzpatrick could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick, 45, headed the interactive services business in
Europe for Oracle Corp. before he joined Liberate in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Tumble as Tensions Rise</HD>
<DH>Iraq war fears, bombing in Chechnya and standoff with North
Korea unsettle investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geopolitical jitters sent stocks reeling Friday as the market closed
out another losing week en route to its third straight down year.</LD>
<LD>   Investors shifted money into Treasury securities and gold as a
rebel bombing in Chechnya left more than 40 people dead, adding to
growing nervousness over the U.S. standoffs with both Iraq and North
Korea. At the same time, the dollar continued its recent swoon as war
worries soured investors on the greenback.</LD>
<LD>   "Just look at the headlines: Iraq, North Korea, now Chechnya --
it's the perfect international storm," said Reg Gipson, president of
Alpha Analytics Investment Group in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.83
points, or 1.5%, to 8,303.78; the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank
14.26 points, or 1.6%, to 875.40; and Nasdaq slipped 19.58 points, or
1.4%, to 1,348.31.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was light at the end of the holiday-shortened week, but
losers outnumbered winners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 5 to 4 on Nasdaq. It marked the third losing week in
the last four for the major U.S. indexes, with the Dow sliding 2.4%,
the S&amp;P 500 2.3% and Nasdaq 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   With two trading days left in 2002, the Dow is down 17.1% for
year, the S&amp;P 23.8% and Nasdaq 30.9%. For both the blue-chip Dow and
S&amp;P 500, this will be the first three-year losing streak since
1939-1941, and for the tech-heavy Nasdaq this will be the first in
its 30-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Although the key concerns for investors are the possibility of war
in Iraq and reports that North Korea could be developing nuclear
arms, other factors are weighing on stocks as well, said Chris
Orndorff, head of equities at L.A.-based Payden &amp; Rygel.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors are selling stocks to capture losses that can be
used to offset capital gains and income on their 2002 tax returns.
"People certainly have a lot of beaten-down stocks to choose from,"
Orndorff noted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, mixed signals on the U.S. economy are offering little
encouragement, he added.</TE>
<TE>   While the government reported Friday that new home sales rose 5.7%
in November, the surprisingly robust data were overshadowed by
worries that the holiday shopping season has been disappointing for
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon.com dropped $1.44 to $18.86 -- bringing its three-day loss
to 15% -- and Wal-Mart fell 60 cents to $49.16.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, which is considered by many a haven during troubling times,
rose 50 cents to a new 5 1/2-year high, settling at $349.20 an ounce.
Precious metals mutual funds have been one of the few winning
categories this year.</TE>
<TE>   Oil rose to a two-year high, climbing 23 cents to $32.72 a barrel,
as traders expressed concern that Venezuela would fail to make good
on its pledge to revive its crude output, which has been sharply
curtailed by the country's ongoing general strike.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because the government says they will get things up and
running doesn't mean it will happen," Fimat USA broker Michael
Fitzpatrick told Bloomberg News. Venezuela is seen as a crucial oil
source if war disrupts Mideast supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Chemical and plastics companies, which use oil as a raw material,
slumped. Dow Chemical lost $1.09 to $29.11, and Hercules slid 51
cents to $8.67.</TE>
<TE>   In the currency market, the dollar weakened against the euro and
the Japanese yen in response to the rising fears of war. It slipped
to 119.94 yen from 120.03 on Thursday, while the euro climbed to
$1.04.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Bond yields fell as investors in search of safety snapped up
government debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
slipped to 3.81% from Thursday's close of 3.9%.</TE>
<TE>   * European indexes fell, including a 5.4% plunge in Germany, a
2.9% loss in Britain and a 2.3% drop in France.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks declined amid concern that the bear market will
take a toll on earnings in the sector. Citigroup lost 85 cents to
$35.17, Goldman Sachs sank $1.63 to $67.92 and J.P. Morgan Chase fell
65 cents to $23.80.</TE>
<TE>   * El Segundo-based Unocal sank $1.53 to $30.12 after the oil
company lowered its fourth-quarter outlook.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Firms Post Biggest Quarterly Growth in 2 Years</HD>
<DH>The average corporate profit increase is 13% as consumers
continue to spend and companies reduce expenses through firings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. corporate profits grew at the fastest pace in more than two
years this quarter, as consumers spent more on cars and household
goods and companies reduced expenses by firing workers.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings for companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose an
average of 13% in the fourth quarter, according to a report Friday by
Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' earnings forecasts.
Profits had not risen that much since the third quarter of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Mortgage rates at the lowest levels in three decades helped
consumers refinance homes, giving them more to spend and lifting
earnings at General Motors Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Cost
cutting, much of it from firing workers, contributed to higher
profits at Cisco Systems Inc. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. The gains may
slow next year as businesses postpone replacing computer systems and
other equipment.</LD>
<TE>   "It's certainly not off to the races, but it's a marked
improvement," said Barbara Marcin, who helps manage $22 billion at
Gabelli Asset Management Inc. "The only thing we haven't had is
capital spending."</TE>
<TE>   Profit increases may be stymied should the United States go to war
with Iraq or North Korea, analysts have said.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil prices, which rose to about $28 a barrel this quarter
from $20.53 in the year-ago period, also threaten earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   This quarter's rise in profits stems in part from the comparison
with last year's fourth quarter, when the U.S. economy was just
starting to climb out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   The forecasts First Call gathers don't always compare net income,
and estimates may exclude certain costs.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of rising profits helped lift the Nasdaq composite
index 17% since Sept. 30, the Dow Jones industrial average 11% and
the S&amp;P 500 by 9.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial companies will be among those reporting profit gains or
shrinking losses, according to First Call's data.</TE>
<TE>   Alcoa Inc. will earn 26 cents a share, according to analysts
surveyed by First Call, contrasted with a loss of $142 million, or 17
cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies are wringing out higher profits by reducing
expenses at a time when sales are rising little or even falling.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco, the biggest maker of computer networking equipment, is
forecast to earn 13 cents a share, excluding certain expenses,
compared with a profit of $664 million, or 9 cents, on the same basis
in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch, the world's biggest securities firm by capital,
will have profit of 65 cents a share, contrasted with a year-ago net
loss of $1.26 billion, or $1.51 a share. The company has eliminated
18,600 jobs since the end of 2000.</TE>

<HD>StarLink Corn Said to Be Found in Japan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan has found trace amounts of unapproved StarLink corn in an
American shipment bound for Tokyo's food supply, renewing fears that
major trading partners once again may turn their backs on U.S. crops,
U.S. exporters said.</LD>
<LD>   The return of StarLink corn comes as the United States tries to
convince reluctant trading partners like the European Union and
southern Africa that genetically modified crops are safe for
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Made by Aventis CropScience, the biotech corn variety slipped into
the U.S. food supply in September 2000 sparking a nationwide recall.
Aventis CropScience was later sold to Bayer as part of the fallout
from the StarLink recalls.</LD>
<TE>   Fears of a fresh backlash against all U.S. corn weighed on U.S.
grain markets on Friday, traders said.</TE>

<LD>   That figure is more than the combined current value of Citigroup
Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</LD>

<LD>In the debate over online piracy and consumer rights, Sony Corp. has
a unique vantage point.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does it own a major Hollywood studio and record company,
but it also builds computers, CD burners, DVD recorders and portable
media players that millions of consumers use to make unauthorized
copies of movies and music.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the Tokyo company aims to strike a delicate balance:
to protect copyrights while building gear that lets consumers use
digital media more freely. To that end, Sony is forging ahead with a
new generation of devices designed to connect to the Internet and to
one another, allowing users to move digitized music, movies and
information around a personal network with great ease.</LD>
<TE>   Kunitake Ando, Sony's president and chief operating officer, is
optimistic that the differences between content creators and device
makers will be resolved in the marketplace. He is expected to reveal
more about his vision for this new digital era in a keynote speech at
next month's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In
the meantime, he spoke with The Times about networking, copy
protection and other hot topics via videoconference from Sony's
headquarters in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How do you strike a balance between the needs of the
content community and the needs of consumer electronics
manufacturers?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Some people think consumer electronics and content, like
[motion] pictures or music, go different ways. But I don't think so,
because hardware needs content in order to make a usable, attractive
product, and [vice versa].</TE>
<TE>   In the network age, without network-connected hardware, I don't
think the music industry will survive, and [motion] pictures are the
same. It may seem that they're looking in a different direction only
because they try to protect their own rights. They want to have
strong copy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How will consumers react to copy protection?</TE>
<TE>   A: We need a little bit more advancement from technology, but from
the users' viewpoint, I don't think it's a good thing to get
everything free on the Internet. Of course, there is a certain
balance between usability and price and the ease of use and so forth.
Right now, we are in the transition period. If you want to really
develop a good content industry, we need certain protection, and the
same thing for the consumer electronics industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sony is in an advantageous position because, since we have both
industries, we can really talk and discuss with each other within the
group. In fact, we have a committee we call Contents and Technology,
[where we] frequently discuss the benefit for both industries. So I
think when we introduce new types of products, we are trying to be
always ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think the Sony Music side of the company has done enough
to let consumers -- and particularly Sony Vaio owners -- do what they
say they want to do with digital music?</TE>
<TE>   A: Record label companies' whole model has been sort of collapsed
or broken. Package media sales are now decreasing instead of
increasing. So it's very clear that we have to change the way we do
business in the music industry because they're probably hard-hit from
the network age. In that sense, I think the music label has to move
faster.</TE>
<TE>   As Steve Jobs of Apple [Computer Inc.] said, nobody wants to steal
anything -- if there's a reasonable way [to buy it] and the price is
[fair]. The music in- dustry has not caught up fast enough with the
demands of the users. I think that once it settles, we'll be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you providing a way for your devices to communicate with
one another?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's our direction. We are now introducing many products
which will all be connected with each other. We introduced last
September the new device that we call RoomLink, which connects a Vaio
PC and Wega TV. And we introduced a new product called Cocoon, which
connects with a TV but is directly connected to broadband [a
high-speed Internet connection]. This Cocoon machine will actually
evolve depending on the user's habits and taste and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It sounds as if it's designed to be a storage network for the
whole home. Is that correct?</TE>
<TE>   A: Right, with a hard disk drive and Linux operating system. I
think we are going to continue to introduce many of these networkable
devices, all connected seamlessly. We are going to connect all our
consumer electronics products under one platform instead of just
introducing all those stand-alone type of products. That's basically
our strategy, so that our platform products connect easily to an
Internet service as well as the content the user feels like using.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you get the rest of the consumer electronics world to
connect their devices to the Sony platform?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are ready to discuss [the platform] with any consumer
electronics company to make it an open standard. We aren't going to
make it closed only to Sony, because unless users can easily connect
our products to all other electronic companies', it's not so
convenient. We don't want to really stick to a propriety type of
standard format or even media technology.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there a risk that lawmakers, particularly those in
Washington, might overreact and mandate certain technologies for
content protection? Could that hurt your ability to compete and
develop products?</TE>
<TE>   A: Truthfully, I'm rather optimistic because both industries need
each other. Right now, of course, there are sometimes heated
discussions. The Consumer Electronics Assn. is saying very extreme
things and the Motion Picture Assn. of America is saying [extreme
things in] the other direction. It's a really tough issue, but I
think both industries will find a comfortable manner, so I'm not so
worried.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Much of the content industry has adopted Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows Media audio and video formats and its digital rights
management software to protect their content. How do you feel about
those technologies?</TE>
<TE>   A: All of our consumer electronics products will not necessarily
adopt Windows Media audio and video. It's necessary for the PC but
not all the consumer electronics products.</TE>
<TE>   We are going to have our own media technology. We should have our
own DRM [digital rights management] and our own [digital media
formats] and also media players as well. People should have a choice.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, when we introduced [music players designed to resist
piracy], user ability was so bad, nobody wanted to use them. That's
why people [would] rather rip [CDs] or download [songs] from the Net.</TE>
<TE>   But I think technology has advanced quite a bit since then. It's
much easier. So I think consumers will also get used to paying a
certain price for the content they get. It may take some time, but it
will be OK.</TE>

<HD>Those Eligible for Coupons Must File Claims by March 17</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Mexican immigrants are eligible for modest refunds as a result
of settlements in a pair of class-action suits against three
money-transfer companies. Here's a look at the process for making
claims in those cases:</LD>
<LD>   Over the next month, claim forms will be mailed to people who
wired money from the United States to Mexico between about 1987 and
1999 using Viad Corp.'s MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. or First Data
Corp. subsidiaries Western Union Financial Services Inc. or Orlandi
Valuta.</LD>
<LD>   The forms are meant to verify people's transactions and allow them
to pick their choice of two $4.25 coupons or one $6 coupon for each
transaction between November 1993 and 1999. For transfers that
happened before that, they can receive one coupon for every 10
transactions.</LD>
<TE>   People are being asked to sign the claim form -- written in
English and Spanish -- and send it back to the settlement
administrator. Class members who have questions or want to report a
change of address can call (888) 285-3607.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement administrator has company records naming people who
conducted wire transfers during that period. But anyone who doesn't
receive a claim form can call the toll-free number.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline to return claim forms is March 17. The coupons will
be mailed out in May.</TE>

<HD>Tapping Into Money Wiring</HD>
<DH>Banks seek a share of the business but face myriad rivals
big and small</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard and Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bank of America Corp. announced a couple of weeks ago that it
was expanding more aggressively into the business of helping Mexican
immigrants send money back to their homeland, you might have thought
that a money-transfer company such as Sigue Corp. would become
alarmed.</LD>
<LD>   As Sigue Vice President Manuel Diaz sees it, though, it's the big
bank that should worry.</LD>
<LD>   Although Bank of America agreed to buy 25% of Mexican banking
giant Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin  -- whose 926 branches will
dramatically expand its money-transfer opportunities to Mexico -- San
Fernando-based Sigue believes that it holds a huge advantage: a
pervasive presence.</LD>
<TE>   Its thousands of agents are at groceries, flower shops, shoe
stores and electronics outlets on both sides of the border, ready to
handle the paperwork -- and take a commission -- on a crush of
cross-border transactions each day.</TE>
<TE>   "Santander can't cover every corner of Mexico," Diaz said. "We
deliver where others can't."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bank of America, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and
100 or so other banks are betting they can make inroads in the
lucrative remittance trade, they face a slew of established rivals --
from tiny storefront operations to mid-size companies such as Sigue,
to First Data Corp.'s Western Union Financial Services Inc. and Viad
Corp.'s MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very significant barriers for the banks," said Roberto
Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington research
group.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, though traditional money-wiring shops often charge more
than the $10 per transfer service promoted by the banks, many Latino
immigrants view them as convenient and nonthreatening. Money-transfer
customers also are put off by bank fees for such things as overuse of
automated teller machines and failure to maintain minimum balances,
according to a Pew study released last month.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to overcome the obstacles, executives at Charlotte,
N.C.-based Bank of America have been talking up their plans to serve
the 21 million U.S. residents of Mexican ancestry -- a vast,
fast-growing and largely untapped community.</TE>
<TE>   The largest retail bank in California and the nation, Bank of
America started a money-transfer service last spring that allows
Latinos to load cash into ATMs in this country so their family
members or friends can withdraw it from ATMs in Mexico. Now, its
decision to acquire a $1.6-billion stake in Santander Serfin,
Mexico's third-largest financial institution, has intensified the
battle for cross-border banking business.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo started a bank-to-bank transfer
program in 1995 and began publicizing it heavily in 2001. New
York-based Citigroup has its own ATM transfer service and last year
bought Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, parent of Mexico's largest
bank.</TE>
<TE>   The banks hope to provide a range of services to Latinos, but it's
easy to see why they want to start with fund transfers: Immigrants
send more than $23 billion annually to Latin America and the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Banco de Mexico says money transfers to Mexico hit $10 billion
this year, up from $6.5 billion in 2000. But UCLA political economist
Raul Hinojosa estimates an additional $3 billion in cash was sent but
went unrecorded by the central bank.</TE>
<TE>   All told, emigres have sent $80 billion back to Mexico in the last
20 years, virtually none of it through mainstream banks, said
Hinojosa, calling it an enormous lost opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the bank competition, along with class-action
lawsuits accusing the major wire operations of concealing large
foreign-exchange fees, has helped cut the cost of sending funds to
Latin America, which five years ago averaged 20% of the amount
transferred.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the total fees for handling and foreign exchange run about
7% and appear headed lower, said Manuel Orozco, a Nicaraguan-born
political scientist who studies money transfers for Washington-based
think tank Inter-American Dialog.</TE>
<TE>   But the banks have captured less than 2% of the market from the
traditional wire operations, Orozco noted. He says their share will
grow by about 1 percentage point a year to perhaps 8% in five years.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the small market penetration is that banks
generally have targeted "acculturated" Latinos -- those who are
established enough in the United States to need savings and checking
accounts, credit cards and home loans.</TE>
<TE>   Customers of Wells Fargo's Intercuenta Express, which charges $10
to transfer funds from U.S. accounts to those at Mexico's Grupo
Financiero Bancomer, on average use six Wells Fargo services. That's
slightly more than the typical Wells Fargo customer and cause for
celebration at a bank that prides itself on "cross-selling."</TE>
<TE>   As for Bank of America, it requires customers of its ATM-based
money-transfer service to have a credit card or bank account. It
costs $10 to send money to Mexico if the account is with the bank;
$15 if it is not.</TE>
<TE>   Eusebio Rivera, head of Bank of America's Latino initiatives, said
37% of the new customers attracted by fund transfers eventually open
accounts at his bank, which can then market them other services. He
also pointed out that Latinos are the fastest-growing group for
homeownership in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about a lot more than just remittances," Rivera said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the fierce competition in the money-transfer business, it
better be.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, market leader Western Union continues to expand,
with international transactions up 33% in the third quarter,
spokeswoman Wendy Carver-Herbert said. As for the U.S. banks, she
said their plans to convert immigrant wire-service clients into
mainstream consumers of financial services would not happen
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "It has yet to be seen whether banks have the patience for that
strategy to work," she said. "In the meantime, we're sticking to our
knitting."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to valuable locations, wire houses have another edge
in gaining the trust of an immigrant client base: the customers'
beliefs that they can't open a bank account because they are
undocumented or that such a paper trail will lead to deportation.
Although banks are trying to assuage those fears by accepting Mexican
consular IDs, old habits die hard.</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable "distrust to overcome," said John Kraft, an
analyst with Portland-based D.A. Davidson who tracks the stock of
Western Union's parent company, First Data. "This business has been
very slow to change. It doesn't look like new technologies or
competition from banks will make a big impact anytime soon."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the office of OrderExpress, one of more than a dozen
wire-transfer agents clustered within a few blocks of South Broadway
in downtown Los Angeles, a woman who would give only her first name,
Concepcion, explained why she steers clear of banks.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, she said, the banks she has checked out give lousy
exchange rates, meaning that fewer of the dollars she earns cleaning
houses around Los Angeles would make it to relatives in Mexico City
and Chiapas. Banks also don't keep the convenient hours that she
finds at the kiosks on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   But the principal reason for staying away from the banks, she
says, is that she is an illegal immigrant and leery of forking over
too much personal information to a big institution.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have papers," she said. Besides, she added, "I can get
what I need" at a money-transfer outlet.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines Seeks to Dissolve Labor Pacts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
on Friday seeking to scrap labor agreements as it aims to slash costs
but said leaders of four of its six unions had agreed to pay cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The airline, which has pursued cost cuts to satisfy its lenders
since filing for bankruptcy protection Dec. 9, said it had reached
tentative deals on wage cuts with the unions representing its pilots,
flight attendants, dispatchers and meteorologists.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the pilots and flight attendants stopped short
of calling the proposals tentative deals but said they were in
discussions with the airline.</LD>
<TE>   UAL is seeking to save more than $70 million a month through
interim pay cuts of 29% from its pilots, 9% from flight attendants
and 13% from machinists as of Jan. 1, according to court papers. It
also wants flight controllers and transport workers to take a 13%
cut.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, United, the world's No. 2 airline, said it was
willing to withdraw Friday's motion to void its labor contracts if
key unions ratified proposed pay cuts by early January.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would seek court authority to impose pay cuts
on the International Assn. of Machinists, which has not agreed to any
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn. said union leaders would
meet soon to consider the company's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   UAL shares closed up 9 cents at $1.38 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Unocal Shares Drop on Forecast</HD>
<DH>Stock falls nearly 5% after oil giant lowers earnings
projection based on futures prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Unocal Corp. fell nearly 5% on Friday, a day after the
second-largest independent oil company in the U.S. lowered its
fourth-quarter profit forecast because oil and natural gas prices
fell short of projections.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal shares slid $1.53 to $30.12 in New York Stock Exchange
trading, the biggest decline since Oct. 29. Unocal shares had risen
14% since Nov. 1 as U.S. crude oil and natural gas futures prices
soared to their highest levels in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo-based company said Thursday after the markets
closed that adjusted earnings would be 40 to 45 cents a share in the
quarter, less than an earlier forecast of 50 to 60 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting a profit of 52 cents a share, according to
the average estimate in a Thomson First Call poll.</TE>
<TE>   Lower-than-expected oil and gas prices account for about 11 cents
of the revision, the company said. Unocal expects $28.10 a barrel for
crude oil in the fourth quarter, 5.5% less than an earlier estimate,
and $3.90 per million British thermal units of gas, 4.9% lower than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal said fourth-quarter profit also would be crimped by
environmental cleanup costs and higher-than-expected acquisition
expenses. After-tax environmental cleanup costs of $22 million to $25
million will lower fourth-quarter net income by 9 to 10 cents a
share, to 30 to 35 cents, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the costs are for cleanup responsibilities at
service stations, refineries and other sites that Unocal has closed
or no longer owns, the company said in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The costs also involve oil and gas fields in California and
Michigan that Unocal previously operated.</TE>
<TE>   The conversion of Pure Resources Inc. stock options to Unocal
options will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by 4 cents a share, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal shares have risen since it bought the 35% of Pure it didn't
own; it will have to record $11 million in additional costs to
account for the higher value.</TE>

<LD>On a recent trip to the Gold Coast of Long Island, that area made
famous by the opulent rapacity of the Gilded Age robber barons, I was
startled by the degree of penetration that Latino immigrants have
made.</LD>
<LD>   A long stroll through the streets brought the sounds and smells
more common to my new home in Los Angeles than to the hard-nosed and
straight-laced Yankee town I knew so well as a boy. There were now
mercados, bodegas and botanicas, the smell of carnitas sizzling on a
grill and the sound of mariachi and ranchera in the air. I even saw a
Salvadoran flag hanging from the windowsill of a venerable red-brick
building opposite the police station.</LD>
<LD>   I wondered what brought them here, so far from home.</LD>
<TE>   I walked to the old church where I had been baptized and was later
schooled by no-nonsense nuns and priests. Slipping into the sanctuary
to catch the last 10 minutes of Mass, I noticed the brown faces
peppering the congregation: fathers holding wide-eyed children in
callused hands, mothers in shawls lost in prayer, perhaps dreaming of
their villages so far away.</TE>
<TE>   Later, while sitting on a bench in the church garden, meditating
on the nature of change, I struck up a conversation with the parish
priest, himself of Latino heritage. I inquired how these latest
arrivals sustained themselves in an area with one of the highest
costs of living in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The women clean houses and take care of children," he said. "The
men do construction and landscaping."</TE>
<TE>   "You mean mowing lawns," I said, nodding toward an expanse of lawn
next to the church. "I used to cut that as a kid," I added,
remembering afternoons awash in a blue haze of motor exhaust and
humidity. Unimpressed, the padre shrugged his shoulders and said,
"Americans don't mow lawns anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The priest's words reverberated in my head.</TE>
<TE>   Although I cannot pretend to have had a life as hard and rugged as
my father's, I do, with hindsight, cherish those memories of hard
work wherever hard work could be found for a teenager, be it mowing
lawns, painting houses, shoveling snow or, for one particularly
muscular summer, working at a lumber yard where, after quitting time,
I would meet my friends with newfound blue-collar gusto.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that we ever expected to grow into blue-collar jobs; our
parents' hard work and determination to see us on to college and
"comfortable" jobs precluded that choice, but we did gain an
appreciation for physical work and for those within the community who
did it for a living.</TE>
<TE>   To think that such basic chores are now the livelihood of
immigrant families makes me wonder how we, as Americans, got to this
point. To hear it from those who remained in my hometown, the price
of housing and depressed wages for tradesmen because of immigrant
competition have compelled many to continue living with their parents
or to move away, while the immigrants huddle together in converted
garages to save money to wire back home.</TE>
<TE>   However much I may sympathize with the plight of Salvadorans,
Mexicans, Peruvians and, oh yes, the Somalis (of Maine) looking to
improve their lot so far from home, I find myself more concerned with
those Americans who have become refugees in their own country. Our
"captains of industry" have embraced an economic model in which
workers' skills are exported, cheap labor is imported and communities
are "churned" like some Wall Street commodity.</TE>
<TE>   I am also concerned for the young people who have lost that
connection to hard work and money well earned. They now see an
emerging servant underclass living cheek by jowl with their masters
in some strange symbiosis of mutual exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the old robber barons of the Gold Coast would understand
what is happening, but for the rest of us, comfortable and complacent
for the moment, there may be some reckoning ahead.</TE>

<LD>We gather every Friday at 1 o'clock looking expectantly to see if all
14 of us are present. One week, Giacomo and Grace could not make it.
Giacomo has Parkinson's disease, and sometimes it's a little more
than he can handle. Grace ignores her arthritic knees for the most
part, but every now and then the spirit wearies.</LD>
<LD>   This week we've all managed to come, the Creative Writers Group at
the Colfax Senior Center. The weekly ritual begins. The assorted
papers surface from the manila folders and oversize notebooks. Many
are written on empty space salvaged from pieces previously used. Some
are neatly typed or processed on a computer by those persistent
enough to challenge the mysterious intricacies of the machine. Helen,
who is a talented painter, deprecates modestly in advance, a poem
inspired by a profusion of flowers seen from her window. She is
startled by the reaction because we are moved at the depth of color
and life her words have captured.</LD>
<LD>   Rose, perhaps the shyest of the lot, is still working at 72 to
supplement her Social Security. She carries on with her
characterization of an older woman rocking alone and reminiscing
aloud about her children, her joys and her disappointments.</LD>
<TE>   The poetry flows. Alligators, and other denizens, allegorically
roam the forests and the glades, imparting wisdom and sharing
experiences only the imagination conjures up.</TE>
<TE>   Mar has parked his walker. He has written about the "Legend of the
Mountain," a folk tale his father told him when Mar was a child in
the Philippines. The symbolism and emotion unfold as we each read a
portion. Mar cannot speak clearly since a stroke affected his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy pours this week's energy into a cause. However, Izzy always
has a cause. Last week a newly painted wall in his neighborhood was
smothered in graffiti. The frustration and anger spilled over, and
Izzy diverted them into a rhapsodic protest against ugliness.</TE>
<TE>   Sophie is somewhat apologetic. She is empty this week. A sick
grandchild demanded much of her attention. It is almost a certainty
sometime in the near future a metaphorical poem of troubling winds
and inner courage will echo her feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Louise deserves to be our first emissary to alien worlds. Her
fertile imagination has already resolved many of the conflicts that
may arise.</TE>
<TE>   For those of you who would decry the lack of romance and caring in
today's world, take heart, much of it is still vibrant and alive. The
repository is generously contributed to by 20-year-old minds confined
in 70-year-old bodies. We will pass them on to a younger generation.</TE>
<TE>   Passion does not stop at 65. Somewhere in Racine, Augusta,
Albuquerque, Yakima and in the inclusive et cetera, it happens on a
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or perhaps on a Thursday. For me, in the
Valley of San Fernando, the trip to the spiritual bank occurs on
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Loopholes as Big as an SUV</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States, home of the Hummer, the Navigator and the
Expedition, today imports 60% of its oil. Roughly a quarter of that
comes from the Persian Gulf, primarily from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
Yes, Iraq. Compare that with 1973, when only 33% of daily oil
consumption was imported, and still the Arab embargo sent the economy
into a tailspin.</LD>
<LD>   Reliance on Middle East oil is a front-and-center issue, so a bit
of the federal tax code that gives special deductions for the very
biggest SUVs deserves inspection.</LD>
<LD>   Businesspeople who buy the least efficient mass-market car, a
Hummer H2 (average miles per gallon: 11) can reap $13,476 in tax
breaks one year after purchase. By contrast, those who buy or lease
one of the most efficient cars, the Toyota Prius (average miles per
gallon: 48), get only $3,729.</LD>
<TE>   Congress did not set out to shower lavish tax rewards on gas
guzzlers. When it exempted passenger vehicles weighing more than
6,000 pounds loaded, lawmakers meant to help farmers and construction
workers buy large pickups and vans for hauling. At the time, in the
late 1970s, light trucks were mainly commercial vehicles. Today, they
account for nearly one-half of passenger vehicles sold.</TE>
<TE>   Intentional or not, the tax loopholes should be closed.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has the authority to take action now by more vigorously
scrutinizing the "100% business use" claims that are necessary to
qualify for the deductions. The IRS need not let real estate agents
carrying nothing bulkier than brochures in their Lincoln Navigators
claim tax benefits written to help farmers afford a heavy pickup.</TE>
<TE>   To rein in the wasteful symbolism of this law, Congress will have
to stop dodging the problem, as a House-Senate energy conference
committee did this year. In a piece on how to "reduce our growing
dependence on volatile Middle Eastern countries for oil" published in
the Beltway journal Roll Call this month, the chairman of that
committee, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) didn't once mention the
need to close these tax loopholes, much less improve overall vehicle
fuel economy. Instead, he said that when Congress reconvenes in
January, he will concentrate on opening the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Raising vehicle fuel economy across the board would reduce oil
dependence far more dramatically than drilling in the wildlife
refuge. Getting rid of one counterproductive tax break, however,
would at least signal that Congress is capable of standing up to the
auto industry.</TE>

<LD>Gray Davis threw a splashy, costly bash when he was inaugurated for
his first term in 1999. The state was flying high. Tax dollars were
pouring into the treasury at an unprecedented rate. And Democrats
were swooning over the greatest election victory by a governor-elect
in nearly half a century. There was some cluck-clucking over the
special-interest donations that financed all this, but no one
begrudged Davis the opportunity to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   That was then. Today, Davis nears his second term after winning a
narrow victory over a weak GOP challenger. His personal popularity is
in the pits after the electric power debacle of his first term. And
the state treasury is bleeding red ink, suffering the most massive
budget shortfall in state history.</LD>
<LD>   Davis at least recognizes the reality of the times and the need
for some austere symbolism. His second inaugural will be about as
minimalist as those of Gov. Jerry Brown in 1975 and 1979, whom Davis
served as chief of staff.</LD>
<TE>   Davis helped craft Brown's "small is beautiful" approach to the
governor's office. Brown drove a blue Plymouth from the state auto
pool and slept on a mattress on the floor in an apartment across the
street from the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   On inaugural day, he held simple swearing-in ceremonies in
Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles and then repaired to a
Chinese restaurant for a quiet supper with friends and staff.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Davis held multiple-day events that included a
$125-a-ticket entertainment extravaganza at Arco Arena and a
black-tie ball at Cal Expo. In all, 13 events cost donors nearly $4
million.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there will be no furs or tuxes. A "Celebrate
California" jeans-and-barbecue event will be held at the Sacramento
Convention Center the night of Jan. 6. Ticket price: $15. Davis will
be sworn in at noon that day.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural weekend will begin Jan. 4 with a "day of service."
Davis and supporters will conduct cleanup and beautification projects
at two sites in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   No one is talking "small is beautiful" these days. But terms such
as low-key and austere are quite acceptable and appropriate to these
difficult times. Let's hope the Legislature picks up the same theme.</TE>

<LD>Boyle Heights is known this time of year for its nacimientos, the
homemade Nativity scenes that festoon lawns and living rooms. Part
folk art, part family album, the elaborate dioramas are a tradition
transplanted from Mexico to this neighborhood just east of downtown
Los Angeles. They are a particularly fitting symbol for an area that
has long been a refuge for wanderers in search of welcome.</LD>
<LD>   "Boyle Heights: The Power of Place," a multimedia exhibit at the
Japanese American National Museum in downtown's Little Tokyo,
recounts that history. At the turn of the last century, the
neighborhood, one of the city's first, was home to blacks from the
South and Jews from the Midwest. Japanese Americans flocked there
after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Mexican immigrants came
fleeing civil strife and revolution. Molokans, a dissenting sect of
the Russian Orthodox Church, escaped persecution to settle east of
the Los Angeles River in an area still known as the Russian flats.</LD>
<LD>   They came to Boyle Heights because it didn't have the racially
discriminatory housing covenants increasingly common in newer
neighborhoods. Consequently, it became the most diverse area in Los
Angeles from the 1920s through the 1950s, home to Molokan
congregations, Buddhist temples, synagogues and that holiest of
places, Canter's Deli, until it moved to the Fairfax District.</LD>
<TE>   Home-grown music of the era, which visitors can hear through
headphones at the museum exhibit, includes mariachi, for which Boyle
Heights is still famous, but also taiko, or Japanese drumming, and
swooning klezmer clarinets. The mix yielded such hits as Little
Julian Herrera, East L.A.'s first rhythm and blues star, born Ron
Gregory of Hungarian and Jewish parents, adopted and raised by a
Latino family and discovered by R&amp;B giant Johnny Otis.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle Heights was not inviolate. In the 1930s, the U.S. government
deported Mexican immigrants viewed as taking scarce Depression-era
jobs. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, the government
ordered Japanese Americans held in camps; enrollment at Theodore
Roosevelt High School dropped by one-third as local families gave up
homes and businesses. In 1943, U.S. servicemen rampaged through Boyle
Heights, attacking Mexican Americans in what became known as the Zoot
Suit riots. After the war came the freeways, taking 10% of the
neighborhood's land and uprooting 10,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Boyle Heights of today survives as a refuge. Some of
its more recent residents fled war zones or hard economic times in
Central America and Mexico. In decorating their homes this season,
they tell a story as old as Bethlehem and as new as Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Boyle Heights: The Power of Place" runs through Feb. 23, 2003, at
the Japanese American National Museum, 369 E. 1st St. On Jan. 5 from
1 to 5 p.m., the Latino Urban Forum is sponsoring a self-guided tour
of nacimientos. Download a map at www.therare times.com or call (213)

<LD>"Air Travelers Urged to Unlock Bags, Opening Liability Issue" (Dec.
20) missed the most serious risk facing air passengers who either
voluntarily fly with unlocked checked bags or who have their locked
bags unlocked outside their presence: the risk that contraband or
stolen items may be placed in the bags.</LD>
<LD>   I annually fly to Europe or the Caribbean with checked luggage
whose value far exceeds the outdated international treaty limits for
lost bags. I can protect myself from the risk of theft from my
luggage by packing any items of significant value in my carry-on or
leaving them at home. But I am powerless to protect myself from the
drug dealer or jewel thief who decides to stash his loot in my
now-unlocked bag for his confederate's retrieval at my destination.</LD>
<LD>   What will the U.S. government or Transportation Security
Administration do to protect me when I am arrested by Interpol or the
Turkish police? I do not believe it is too much to ask that my
checked bags be opened only in my presence and relocked in my
presence. The first time my locked, checked bags are opened outside
my presence will be the last time I fly.</LD>

<TE>   If airlines are allowed to open bags and check them without any
regard for a passenger's privacy, then what's to stop them from
eventually doing strip searches to ensure airline safety? It seems
that airlines are continually embellishing on the measures they are
willing to take to combat the events of 9/11. When will this all end
so that we can get on with our lives?</TE>

<TE>   I read with some concern that new airport security measures will
require passengers to not lock their luggage. In October I flew home
from Italy on British Airways. Because of a missed connection, my
suitcase did not accompany me. When I filed a lost luggage claim at
LAX, I had to surrender my keys to the airline so U.S. Customs would
be able to search my bag. When it arrived at my home the next day,
most of the Christmas gifts I had purchased in Italy, as well as
several other personal items, had been stolen. I filed a claim with
the airline but received only one-third of the amount that was stolen
in compensation. My advice to travelers is to hand-carry anything you
value. I learned the hard way.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tribe Risks Rejection, Pushes Plan for Casino Near Capital," Dec.
20: Native American gaming on nonreservation land would set a
dangerous precedent and absolutely should not be allowed. Granting
permission to even one such tribe places us on a slippery slope that
could quickly turn into a landslide of applications for similar
treatment by the many tribes that are suddenly appearing from
seemingly out of nowhere. I am against any and all tribal gaming, as
I believe it is inherently unfair to allow them to profit in an
untaxed manner while other Californians, by virtue of their ethnic
roots, are not allowed the same privilege. This is a very clear
example of an "uneven playing field."</LD>
<LD>   In an extremely short period of time since approval of the 2000
ballot proposal that guaranteed tribes this unfair business
advantage, Native American tribes have parlayed huge gaming profits
into tremendous political clout. As political contributions and
lobbying from tribal windfalls continue to increase, Californians can
only expect to see more perks and political favors go inequitably to
these "impoverished" tribes and their wealthy financial backers. This
nonsense needs to stop now.</LD>

<LD>Did anyone else notice how gorgeous last Sunday was? As my electric
vehicle rounded the ramp from the 710 Freeway to the 105 Freeway, I
could see downtown -- clear as day! And our city was surrounded by
mountains. I'd forgotten how close they are. Textures, colors and
skyline were visible as never before, or so it seemed. I always love
Los Angeles -- born and raised here -- and I'm passionate about this
city, its diversity, opportunities, geography and everything else. I
was so touched to see L.A. in all of its beautiful splendor.</LD>
<LD>   Then reality struck. The blue Volvo diesel in front of me emitted
a continuous black stream of toxins. The ports and the airports are
undoubtedly still doing their thing. And, I realized, the rains
hadn't removed the pollution, just sent it into the hydrological
cycle. People, wake up! We have to do something to clean our air.
Complacency ain't gonna do it. We're so immersed in pollution, we
forget what it's supposed to be like and how beautiful it can be.
Don't just read this, get involved. Don't let them expand things
(airport, shipping, manufacturing) without being responsible to the
environment.</LD>
<LD>   Demand cleaner air. And for God's sake -- get out of those SUVs!</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush, Frist Share Vision to Reshape Their Party," news analysis,
Dec. 22: Ronald Brownstein says that Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) will
provide health care for Americans by using tax credits and providing
stipends to seniors so they can buy their own health plans, thus
eliminating the need for Medicare. Neither of these proposals will
work because those who need health insurance the most, workers in
minimum-pay jobs, do not pay enough in income taxes to cover the
costs of health care, which today for a family of four runs about
$500 a month. No income tax credit for these people will cover the
cost of health insurance. As for providing a stipend to buy private
health insurance, this will suffer from what the insurance companies
call "adverse selection," meaning those who don't have health
problems may not buy it and spend the stipend for rent or something
else. Only those who expect to be sick will buy it. Insurance doesn't
work unless you have a large number of people who never make a claim
in your insurance pool.</LD>
<LD>   Private health insurance is not as efficient as Medicare because
private insurers have a cost of sales, in the form of advertising and
agent commissions, which Medicare doesn't have. Medicare's overhead
is under 4%, compared with as much as 30% for private insurers.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Frist's Possible Conflicts Seen as No Problem Under Senate
Rules," Dec. 22: Medicare reform, prescription drug legislation and
the problem of the nation's more than 40 million people without
health insurance are high on the Senate's agenda. For the following
reasons, Frist has an obvious conflict of interest and should recuse
himself when dealing with these matters or, better yet, not become
majority leader. Frist's brother co-founded (with his father) and
helps lead HCA, a huge chain of for-profit hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, a doctor, became a multimillionaire by acquiring HCA stock.
HCA has paid or agreed to pay penalties of $1.7 billion for Medicare
fraud and other violations of regulations. Although the senator was
not officially in HCA management, it is hard to believe that he did
not discuss HCA affairs with his father and brother and was not aware
of HCA's illegal activities. Even if there is no conflict of interest
under Senate rules, when looking at the senator's background, common
sense indicates otherwise. He should not be involved in Senate
business related to health care and related matters.</TE>

<TE>   How great to see people of this quality and accomplishment in
public office. Particularly after the buffoonery, incompetence and
drowsiness of the Clinton team: Its poor performance let fester and
thrive this international network of madmen that is causing us such
grief.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, don't fault Frist for not voting until age 34. Most
likely, that's when, after he finally completed his marathon-like
training and education, he finally got out of the operating room
before the polls closed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Many Held at Guantanamo Not Likely Terrorists" (Dec. 22) misses
the appalling tragedy that the Bush administration is inflicting on
the American people. The tragedy is not that some innocent farmers
are mixed in with real terrorists but that they are all being held
without charge, without legal representation and without trial.</LD>
<LD>   I have faith that our criminal justice system could provide fair
trials and I have faith that military courts-martial could provide
fair trials. It is our politicians, both Republicans and Democrats,
who demonstrate their lack of faith in the American system that they
swore to uphold. Should we be proud that we are running a
concentration camp? The Germans have spent the last 50 years
apologizing for their atrocities and wars of aggression. Are we to
spend the next 50 years doing the same?</LD>

<LD>Hooray! Huzzah! Hallelujah!</LD>
<LD>   Joshua Zeitz's "The Fall (and Potential Rise) of Liberalism"
(Opinion, Dec. 22) says what so many true Democrats are thinking.
Zeitz's proposed Democratic strategy is in harmony with history: For
the last 50 years, every major public benefit -- such as Social
Security -- has been sponsored by Democrats and opposed by
Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   We must send reprints of the article, every month, to every House
and Senate Democrat who acts like a Republican (think Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut). After a while, maybe they will get the
message. If not, we must find true Democrats to take their places,
whose campaign message is clear: Liberal Democrats vote for us.
Conservative Republicans vote for Wall Street.</LD>
<TE>   Charles T. Newton</TE>
<TE>   Del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, I agree, let's have the Democrats redefine liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   On affirmative action, Democrats could say: We support a policy
where skin-color or heritage is the determining factor in hiring when
more-qualified people are available.</TE>
<TE>   On freedom of speech, Democrats could say: We support enforcing
speech codes so that feelings aren't hurt, even though free speech
and debate are limited.</TE>
<TE>   On the Supreme Court, the Democrats could say: We support creating
laws from the bench by unelected, and therefore unaccountable, judges
to create a nation the electorate has no real power to change.</TE>
<TE>   On welfare, the Democrats could say: We support giving free money
to people who make bad choices repeatedly and giving them no reason
to change their lives because we care and want to take care of
people.</TE>
<TE>   Go get 'em, Dems! But hang on, because your fall might start to
accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Dato</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Zeitz put it in his column, "common-sense liberals" have been
persistent in targeting tax cuts for the middle class and lower,
repairing and maintaining Social Security as a fundamental provision
for part of most people's retirement planning and protecting it from
the volatile stock market, balancing government budgets much in the
same way that we individual citizens have to balance our household
budgets and claiming certain aspects of the environment as public
domain so that private entities will not have the opportunity to
exploit them for profit while leaving them in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   As a liberal who has common sense, I would also hasten to add to
Zeitz's list our insistence that we fix our gravely ailing
health-care system so that it fairly serves all citizens. Then there
is the question of a Republican assault on civil rights through the
thoughts and actions of its politicos and the current
administration's court appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened to the all-encompassing "big tent" that George
W. Bush was touting in his 2000 election campaign and the civility
that he was going to bring to our nation's capital?</TE>
<TE>   On all these issues, and many, many more, the Republicans in power
now have failed miserably, and often with a mean spirit. These
Republicans may be conservative, but they are far from compassionate.
Zeitz does not have to coin a special phrase to try to help us renew
our image. We true liberals (and I do not mean extreme liberals) are
very comfortable in identifying ourselves as liberal and having
others call us liberal.</TE>
<TE>   No adjectives need to be added because, by our very nature, we
practice both common sense and compassion.</TE>
<TE>   We liberals are just waiting until the end of these four years.
With a full four years of Republican blunders, our star, which has
never burned out, will rise to greater heights than ever before. We
know our cause is just and fair because it is based on a caring
philosophy and effective, sensible programs to run a country in a
truly civilized manner.</TE>

<LD>Re "Doomed to Repeat Ourselves," by John Saito, Commentary, Dec. 22:
The difference between the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942
and surveillance of Muslims post-Sept. 11 is based on numbers,
resources and ideology. There were only a few hundred thousand
Japanese Americans, mostly on the West Coast, too small a number to
conceal terrorist cells. Also, they were not wealthy and had no
history of, nor an ideology that could be used to justify, terrorist
acts.</LD>
<LD>   Today there is a much larger population of Middle Easterners in
the U.S., which, without monitoring, could easily provide cover for
small, disciplined terrorist cells. Also, great wealth is available
to them, there is a history of terrorist activity, and certain
interpretations of Islam condone, and even demand, terrorism against
its perceived enemies.</LD>
<LD>   I expect our government to protect us from the threat of terrorism
in spite of the histrionics of people like Saito.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Caught Between Dueling Policies," Dec. 21: The real outrage
here is not dueling policies, but visitors with visas who come to the
United States to visit with the intent of never leaving. We were
brutally reminded on 9/11 that our lack of enforcement of our
immigration and visitor laws contributed to that horrible day as well
as to our ongoing problems. Visitors can scream that they have rights
all they want, but we have laws. People wanting to establish
residence in the United States should adhere to our laws and enter
our country legally.</TE>

<TE>   Before we rush to any conclusions that the people detained by the
INS when they showed up to register were just "waiting for the
paperwork to come through," let's wait until all the facts are in
("INS Detentions Are a Bust," editorial, Dec. 20). It's worth
remembering that Mohamed Atta was also waiting on his student-visa
paperwork when he crashed a jet into the World Trade Center. (His
paperwork finally did come through, six months later.)</TE>
<TE>   Having submitted an application for some kind of adjustment of
status does not mean that it will be granted or that the applicant is
not in violation of the law in the meantime. It is also a very common
delay tactic used by people who are trying to get around the law. One
can only imagine the editorials that would be written if the INS
looked the other way because someone was "waiting on his paperwork"
and that someone turned out to be a terrorist.</TE>

<LD>Re "Homeless May Be Sleepless if Law Passes," Dec. 26: During this
season of warmth and giving, the homeless citizens of Los Angeles are
facing the highest level of persecution in recent memory. The new
year, a time of promise and renewal for those of us with even a
little, is also a year that promises that the poorest among us will
find themselves criminalized for being without and for having the
basic needs of food and shelter.</LD>
<LD>   We are alarmed by the proposals affecting the homeless currently
being introduced into the City Council. Sleeping ("camping") outside
could be made illegal. Without an alternative -- without safe,
affordable housing or adequate shelter -- how can we place a penalty
on sleeping, on existing? An estimated 5,000 adults are homeless
downtown; a third of these are women. An estimated 1,000 children are
living with their parents downtown, either homeless or at risk of
being homeless. There are an estimated 2,000 shelter beds to fit this
need.</LD>
<LD>   Sleeping outside is clearly a last resort. Where is a woman to go
if her very existence is an offense? What are her alternatives?
Approximately 75% of homeless services for L.A. County are centered
downtown. Clearly, this makes our neighborhood (Central City
East/Skid Row) a place of last resort.</LD>
<TE>   Services are not a "magnet." People come downtown because there is
a pronounced lack of services elsewhere in the city and county. As
the economy worsens, as housing prices skyrocket, as welfare reform
measures take their toll, as federal/state/local funding to "safety
net" institutions decreases, there are fewer resources available for
those in need. This is why we are seeing an unprecedented influx of
women and children into downtown.</TE>
<TE>   We were heartened by the passage of the state affordable housing
bond measure (Proposition 46). However, alternatives that may be
developed someday as a result of these moneys are not currently
available to homeless people. Passage of this important bond does not
justify unjust ordinances now in the works.</TE>
<TE>   This is the time of year that we are given to seeing the best in
others and in ourselves, when we feel most openhearted and generous
and when we appreciate our bounty the most. Paradoxically, while good
works are being done throughout the city, our leaders are proposing
measures that will harm the most vulnerable in our midst -- homeless
women and children.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Havens for Homeless Facing More Than They Can Handle," Dec.
22: 'Tis the season to be jolly, or so the words go, but it is far
from what many Americans can sing about. Not having a home, sleeping
on the streets or in their cars, children going to bed hungry and
cold -- this is what their holiday will be. Your article should have
been found on the first page, not on A22.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is in decline, more and more people are losing their
jobs, businesses are closing, public schools are a shambles; these
are top priority issues that should be dealt with. President Bush,
why don't we win the war on poverty in this country before we try to
improve the Iraqis' lifestyle?</TE>

president that he was acknowledging the inadequacy of the current
public programs?</TE>

needy, I propose letting them pay higher taxes.</TE>

<TE>   I wonder if the homeless sweep on skid row has anything to do with
people showing up to sleep in the alley behind my house just west of
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Generations ago, the city decided to concentrate poverty and
homeless services downtown on skid row, to keep the destitute out of
the neighborhoods. We all know that policy has failed, as the
homeless and the poor sleep not only on skid row but also under
bridges, in doorways and in tents, backyards and garages all over the
city. The problem is the lack of affordable housing and the lack of
jobs, especially jobs for black and Latino men.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody needs a place to keep their stuff, sleep safely and take
a bath. With adequate housing and employment opportunities, there's
no more street camping.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In April 2000, three adult southern steelhead trout departed from the
Pacific Ocean during a storm and began fighting their way up Mission
Creek through downtown Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   The smallest of the trio was 22 inches, the largest 29 inches. No
one, not wildlife officials nor area anglers who watched, said they
had seen fish that large in the creek in years. The steelhead
probably had been living at sea for at least a year. They were fat
and ready to spawn.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of their short journey, they passed the Santa
Barbara Pier, several popular hotels and businesses on State Street,
the city's main business artery. After swimming 1.2 miles, they
stopped in a large pool, their upstream travel blocked by a concrete
barrier.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, as summer approached and the water warmed to intolerable
temperatures for the fish, two of the three disappeared, most likely
having returned to the Pacific. The third got sick. Biologists with
the National Marine Fisheries Service and the California Department
of Fish and Game tried relocating it to another creek farther north,
but the fish soon died.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sad ending to an inspiring odyssey, but it also spurred
the town to reconsider the potential for its largest stream. Could a
polluted urban creek cross-hatched with concrete flood-control
barriers one day host annual spawning runs of a salmon-like fish?</TE>
<TE>   "Those steelhead were a really big deal," said Jill Zachary, the
city's creek restoration manager. "It ... elevated all these issues
about Santa Barbara's creeks. It might take a couple more decades to
get steelhead back in Mission Creek on a regular basis, but we think,
long term, it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   The fall after the three fish appeared, voters in the city
overwhelmingly passed a local ballot measure to increase the hotel
tax, with the proceeds -- about $2 million a year -- earmarked for
restoring the city's creeks. Steelhead, much like salmon, are seen as
the ultimate indicators of stream health, because the fish, though
tough, need healthy waterways to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Steelhead are born in freshwater streams and rivers, migrate to
the sea as adults and then return to creeks to spawn when they are 3
or 4 years old. Tens of thousands of steelhead once migrated up
Southern California streams each year, often swimming high into the
mountains, where the best spawning grounds could be found.</TE>
<TE>   Today, only a few hundred steelhead appear in area streams each
year. The southern steelhead, which inhabits Southern California, was
put on the federal endangered-species list in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In many respects, Mission Creek is a classic steelhead stream. It
begins as a spring-fed creek 3,000 feet above Santa Barbara and then
drops steadily from the mountains to the coastal plain and, finally,
to the ocean. The creek usually has water in it year-round and boasts
many deep pools that hold water even during the driest of years.</TE>
<TE>   East of town, in the Los Padres National Forest, Mission Creek and
its largest tributary, Rattlesnake Creek, are comparatively free of
contamination and are lined with oaks and sycamores that shade the
water and keep it cool. The creeks there look much as they did when
the Spanish missionaries settled the area in the 1780s.</TE>
<TE>   But once in Santa Barbara proper, Mission Creek is beset by the
two big problems common to most urban streams: polluted runoff and
man-made obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   To solve those problems, the city has begun a street-sweeping
program to keep contaminants out of the stream. It is planting trees
and shrubs on the stream banks to filter runoff before it hits the
creek.</TE>
<TE>   The city is also looking at removing the biggest obstacle -- the
flood control barrier near the 101 Freeway that blocked the three
steelhead in 2000. Another project is aimed at cleaning up a lagoon
critical to the steelhead's life cycle because it is where they make
a gradual transition from freshwater to saltwater.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Trautwein, a 36-year-old analyst for the nonprofit
Environmental Defense Center, saw his first steelhead when he was 13
in nearby San Jose Creek. He has hiked nearly every mile of every
stream in Santa Barbara County, looking for steelhead and steelhead
habitat. Trautwein has been one of the most active proponents of the
Mission Creek restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cautiously optimistic for two reasons," he said recently.
"One is that people are finally starting to talk about removing these
barriers, which isn't rocket science. It just takes money." The other
reason, he said, is that it's clear to those who take the time to
look that there are plenty of trout still in Mission Creek.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, scientists learned that steelhead and rainbow
trout are genetically identical. For reasons not yet understood, some
rainbow trout in coastal streams migrate to sea and become
saltwater-tolerant steelhead, while other rainbows stay in freshwater
all their lives.</TE>
<TE>   There are hundreds of rainbows today in the upper part of Mission
Creek and its largest tributary, Rattlesnake Creek. Trautwein firmly
believes that all of them, now landlocked behind barriers, could one
day make the round-trip from the mountains to the ocean and back.</TE>
<TE>   To prove his point, Trautwein squatted beside Mission Creek and
pointed to a trout. "That could be the progeny of a steelhead that
went to the ocean five years ago or 50 years ago," he said.</TE>

remove man-made barriers will increase the number of steelhead.</CP>

<LD>   Cal State Northridge (6-3) at Washington (4-4), 2 p.m. -- The
Matadors try again to prove their worth on the road after losing at
Southern Illinois, 84-76. Washington started with losses to Montana
State, Gonzaga and Nevada Las Vegas but has won four of its last
five. The Huskies will be without their second-leading scorer,
freshman Nate Robinson, who also plays cornerback on the football
team and is in El Paso for the Sun Bowl on Tuesday against Purdue.
This is both teams' final tuneup before conference play.</LD>
<LD>   UC Riverside (1-4) at No. 11 Oregon (8-1), 2:30 p.m., KPRO (1570)
-- The Highlanders have had a week to prepare for their stiffest test
of the season against the Ducks. Riverside is 1-4 against Pacific 10
Conference schools. Freshman guard Nate Carter had an impressive
return to his native San Diego, scoring 21 points despite sitting the
first half because of a missed practice. Carter leads the Big West in
scoring at 19 points. Oregon will attempt to tie its school-record
home winning streak at 23. The Ducks rank among the nation's leaders
in scoring at 89.4 points per game.</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine (6-4) vs. Arkansas Littlerock (7-4), at Albuquerque, 5
p.m. PST, KPLS (830) -- The injury-riddled Waves continue to search
for an identity, with forward Glen McGowan out for the season.
Pepperdine has now lost two frontcourt players for the season but
will get a chance to work in younger players Robert Turner and David
Patten at the four-team Lobo Invitational. Sophomore guard Nick
Zachery is Arkansas Littlerock's leading scorer with 14.5 points a
game.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne (2-10) at UC Irvine (4-3), 7 p.m.,
KUCI-FM (88.9) -- The Anteaters are still trying to find themselves
as they near the end of their nonconference schedule. In an
ever-changing starting lineup, sophomore Greg Ethington has replaced
disappointing center Adam Parada. Parada, the team's leading scorer
at 11.1 points, has fouled out of the last two games and already has
four disqualifications this season. IPFW has been fairly competitive
in losses to Oregon State, Butler and Wyoming but only has victories
over Eastern Kentucky and Lipscomb. Center Jim Kessenich leads the
Mastodons in scoring (14.6) and rebounding (5.0).</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (2-6) at San Francisco (3-6), 7 p.m. -- Star
center Pape Sow, the team's second-leading scorer and top rebounder,
was suspended indefinitely for violating team rules, Fullerton
spokesman Mel Franks confirmed Friday. It is the latest bad news for
the injury-plagued Titans, who are down to eight healthy bodies. Some
help is on the way as sophomore guard Fedi Holm-Hadulla is eligible
after sitting out the first eight games because he played with
professional players on a German club team. USF guard Shamell
Stallworth is coming off a 37-point night, the highest of his career,
in the Dons' victory Monday over Brigham Young.</TE>

<LD>Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle ponders revisionist
history and how different the sporting world would be had the rest of
the country followed Mississippi's lead in 1948 and elected
segregationist Strom Thurmond president, as disgraced Senator Trent
Lott recently advocated.</LD>
<LD>   "Prez Strom would have reversed the damage done to the national
pastime a year earlier by Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey," Ostler
wrote, tongue in cheek. "And the NBA's ruinous flirtation with
integration would have been nipped in the bud.</LD>
<LD>   "The LUSA (Loosely United States of America) would have
separate-but-equal leagues in all sports, the champions of which
would meet on postseason barnstorming tours."</LD>
<TE>   More Ostler: "Some things would be the same. Tiger Woods? Still a
golf star, recognized as history's greatest caddie.</TE>
<TE>   "So this might be a good time for sports fans to thank ol' Strom
and his ilk for being so disgusting that they frightened the country
down the correct path when it was at the crossroads, and to thank
Trent Lott for reminding us that we're still a work in progress."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which was the first expansion team to win an NFL
championship?</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1958, Alan Ameche's one-yard
touchdown run at 8:15 of overtime gave the Baltimore Colts a 23-17
victory over the New York Giants, the first NFL championship game to
go to overtime. Many believe this game established the NFL as a
challenger to baseball as the national pastime.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this date in 2000, Robby Portalatin became
only the fourth bowler to roll a 900 series, according to the
American Bowling Congress. Portalatin, a 28-year-old worker for an
auto parts company, bowled his perfect series in Jackson, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Thug Mansion: The jailhouse ambience in the stands pales in
comparison to what goes on down on the field when the Oakland Raiders
are home, according to Sacramento Bee columnist Marcos Breton:</TE>
<TE>   "The Raiders pounded the Denver Broncos into submission in a game
of animal blood-lust and Darwinism distilled to its purest form. A
game of twisted knees, ravaged ankles -- of shrieks and hollers and
vicious blows that knocked the wind from brutal men sadly reduced to
writhing on the Oakland Coliseum turf while black-clad bands of
Raider fans drooled in ecstasy."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds lovely.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The expansion Minnesota Vikings, who began play in
1960, won the NFL title on Jan. 4, 1970, with a 27-7 victory over the
Cleveland Browns. The Vikings, though, went on to lose Super Bowl IV
to the Kansas City Chiefs, 23-7, in the last NFL-AFL Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Denver Post's Jim Armstrong hinted that former
pro athletes suspected of heinous crimes have more in common than the
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Armstrong: "Jayson Williams asked a judge the other day to
dismiss all those charges against him in the shooting death of his
limo driver. Williams reportedly also has hired O.J. to find the real
killer."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iona Coach Jeff Ruland had a chance to relive a great night from a
long time ago. North Carolina Coach Matt Doherty had the worst night
of a turnaround season.</LD>
<LD>   Courtney Fields scored 18 points and Iona beat No. 22 North
Carolina, 65-56, Friday night in the opening round of the Holiday
Festival at New York, the Gaels' first victory over a ranked team in
almost 23 years.</LD>
<LD>   The loss kept the Tar Heels from matching last season's win total
and Sean May, one of the freshmen who had helped the turnaround, will
be out eight to 10 weeks after breaking his foot early in the second
half.</LD>
<TE>   The last time Iona beat a ranked team was also at Madison Square
Garden, on Feb. 21, 1980, when center Ruland led the Gaels to a 77-60
victory over No. 2 Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to live in the past, but I showed them this ring,"
Ruland said of a memento then-Iona coach Jim Valvano gave the players
after that victory. "I told them eight guys from Long Island believed
that night and beat Louisville. That we did whatever it took and
that's what they did tonight. Except for the birth of my three
daughters, this is the proudest day of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Iona (5-3) ended a three-game losing streak by taking advantage of
the Tar Heels (7-3) being short-handed and handling their run at the
start of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaels will play Manhattan, which beat St. John's 72-65, for
the title today in a rematch of last year's championship game.
Manhattan won the 2001 Festival, 69-58.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina, which had to bus from Chapel Hill to New York
because of the winter storm that hit the East Coast on Christmas, was
without starter Jawad Williams, who was at the hotel with a stomach
virus, and sixth man Melvin Scott, suspended for the game for
violating a team rule.</TE>
<TE>   Then, less than 20 seconds into the second half, May injured his
left foot and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   Team physician Tim Taft said May, the son of former Indiana
All-American Scott May, would undergo foot surgery Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona St. 79, Bucknell 52 -- Ike Diogu scored 16 points and
Donnell Knight 15 as the Sun Devils (7-3) advanced to a championship
matchup against Nebraska in its holiday tournament at Tempe, Ariz.
Bucknell dropped to 4-5.</TE>
<TE>   In women's basketball:</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 92, Detroit 52 -- The Blue Devils' Alana Beard had 27
points and eight rebounds and Duke (11-0) forced 30 turnovers in the
first round of the South Padre Island Shootout at Los Fresnos, Texas.
Lindsey Pasquinzo's 19 points led Detroit (2-7).</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Stanford 80, Arizona St. 63 -- Azella Perryman scored six of
her career-high 23 points during the Cardinal's 9-0 run to start the
second half in a Pacific 10 opener at Palo Alto. Kelley Suminski
scored 18 of her career-high 25 points in the first half for Stanford
(7-1). Amy Denson scored 18 points for Arizona State (8-2). The loss
ended a three-game win streak for the Sun Devils, who are 2-15 in
conference openers.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 South Carolina 57, Temple 39 -- Jocelyn Penn scored 16
points and South Carolina (9-1) never trailed at Philadelphia in
handing Temple (4-6) its fifth consecutive defeat, the longest in
Dawn Staley's three years as coach.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Arizona 83, California 53 -- Dee-Dee Wheeler scored a
career-high 29 points and Arizona (7-2) shot a school-record 64.3% in
the Pac-10 opener at Berkeley. Leigh Gregory led Cal (3-5), which
shot 31%.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Joan Bonvincini missed her first game since taking over at
Arizona in 1991. She remained with her family in Connecticut, where
her brother died of cancer on Christmas Day. Bonvincini also will
miss Sunday's game against No. 6 Stanford. Associate head coach
Denise Dove Ianello is running the team until Bonvincini returns.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 65, No. 24 Georgia 61 -- Fallon Stokes scored 18
points and made a key play on defense at Atlanta to lead Georgia Tech
(9-1) to the school's first victory over Georgia (6-4).</TE>
<TE>   Stokes was falling down when she created a turnover by batting
away Kara Braxton's pass after Georgia Tech took a 62-61 lead on a
layup by Jessica Williams with 1:20 remaining. The teams were playing
each other for the 25th time.</TE>

<HD>Brand's Fouls Mean Trouble</HD>
<DH>Power forward gets 29 points in 32 minutes, but Clippers
miss him down the stretch and lose to Suns, 108-95.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Here's what the Clippers missed while power forward Elton Brand sat
out two games because of a strained right calf: 29 points, eight
rebounds, three blocked shots and three assists.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what the Clippers missed when Brand didn't have the ball in
his hands during a 108-95 loss Friday to the Phoenix Suns before
15,756 fans at America West Arena: shot after shot from the
perimeter.</LD>
<LD>   Had Brand avoided foul trouble that limited him to 32 minutes, the
Clippers might have walked away with a victory over one of the
league's hottest teams. Had the Clippers been able to move the ball
into and out of the low post with better precision, they might have
won in a blowout.</LD>
<TE>   But Brand got into foul trouble, picking up his third with 4:42
left in the half and his fourth with 9:54 remaining in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry gambled that Brand could avoid his fifth while
continuing to pick apart the Suns' interior defense. Brand instead
picked up his fifth with the Clippers down, 67-60, with 4:52 left in
the third, and it all went south in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   With Brand on the bench and out of harm's way, the Suns (18-11)
went on a 17-6 run to end the third quarter. They also got a driving
basket from Joe Johnson and a jump shot from Penny Hardaway to start
the fourth quarter to extend their run to 21-6 and their lead to
88-66.</TE>
<TE>   "I got into foul trouble," Brand said after matching his season
high in points. "I've got to keep myself out there. I kind of hurt
the team that way and wasn't able to be out there to stop [the Suns']
runs."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers (12-17) ruined their opportunities by missing 16 of
18 three-pointers, failing to capitalize on Phoenix's collapsing
defense against center Michael Olowokandi. Again and again, the Suns
double-teamed Olowokandi on the low block. Again and again, the
Clippers missed open shots.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski, the Clippers' best three-point shooter, is on the
injured list because of an abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   It also didn't help the Clippers that Olowokandi finished with as
many turnovers as points (six) and didn't play in the fourth quarter
because he simply couldn't get the ball into the hands of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was diplomatic after the game when asked why he benched
Olowokandi, who had a season-low two points in the Clippers' 87-76
loss to the Suns on Dec. 20 at Staples Center, although he
acknowledged his shortcomings without mentioning him by name.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do a better job of getting the ball out of the
post," Gentry said. "The big guy has got to be able to get the ball
out. We tried to go small and get our best athletes on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made a strong run in the fourth quarter, crawling
within 90-81 after Andre Miller's basket with 6:35 to go. The
Clippers then fizzled down the stretch, failing to stop the Suns'
pick-and-roll in the final moments.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury carved them up. He had 26 points on 11-for-21
shooting. Rookie Casey Jacobsen, a former standout at Glendora High
and Stanford, added a career-best 19, making five of seven
three-pointers. The Suns played most of the second half without Shawn
Marion, who sprained his left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a poor job on the screen-and-roll," Gentry said. "We
couldn't get Stephon under control and that was something we talked
about after the last game. We tried to play it every different way we
could."</TE>

<LD>Marko Jaric drove toward the basket, spotted Wang Zhizhi on the
perimeter and fed him the ball. Wang swished a jump shot from the
right corner midway through the second quarter Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the play, Jaric fell with a thud, suffering a high sprain
of his left ankle after stepping on the foot of an unidentified
member of the Phoenix Suns. It's the same type of injury that
sidelined Keyon Dooling for most of last season and kept Lamar Odom
out since Feb. 14.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt such big pain," Jaric said as he limped toward the team's
bus after a 108-95 loss to the Suns. "I was so worried. I hope and I
think I'm going to be OK."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry was less certain.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be out awhile," he said of Jaric.</TE>
<TE>   Odom is scheduled to return tonight after sitting out 11 months
because of a sprained right ankle and wrist. Corey Maggette returned
to the court for the first time since undergoing arthroscopic surgery
on his right knee Nov. 29.</TE>

suspension for his role in the rumble Dec. 20 with the Portland Trail
Blazers. Mills tangled with Bonzi Wells on the floor, attempted to
gain entrance to the Trail Blazer locker room for a rematch and later
parked his car in front of the Portland bus as it attempted to leave
the arena parking lot. Police had to be summoned to escort the Trail
Blazers to the airport.</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck officials have talked with the New York Rangers about
acquiring right wing Radek Dvorak.</LD>
<LD>   Dvorak, who played for Duck General Manager Bryan Murray in
Florida, has fallen out of favor in New York. He has three goals and
13 points this season. Dvorak, who will make $1.575 million this
season, scored 31 goals in 2000-01 and 17 in 2001-02.</LD>
<LD>   Ranger officials have become increasingly frustrated with Dvorak's
play. Coach Bryan Trottier said Dvorak played "scared to death" in
last Saturday's loss to Detroit. Trottier later apologized to Dvorak.</LD>

<TE>   Duck left wing Mike Brown said he would try to keep his emotions
in check tonight against Vancouver. The Ducks claimed Brown off
waivers from the Canucks in October.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I want to show them what I could have brought to their
team," Brown said. "At the same time, I want to show the Ducks what I
can bring.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a good balance of excitement and energy, as long as you
keep a level head, so you can play your game."</TE>

<HD>Donnan, Kruczek Say Kentucky Not for Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Georgia coach Jim Donnan and Central Florida Coach Mike
Kruczek withdrew from consideration for the Kentucky job Friday,
while the status of Mississippi Coach David Cutcliffe was more vague.</LD>
<LD>   Donnan, 57, who works for ESPN, met with Kentucky Athletic
Director Mitch Barnhart this week but pulled out of the running, the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.</LD>
<LD>   Central Florida issued a statement late Thursday saying Kruczek
was no longer a candidate for the job. Barnhart approached Kruczek,
49, about the position last week.</LD>
<TE>   Kentucky is seeking a successor to Guy Morriss, who resigned on
Dec. 9 to become the coach at Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   Barnhart said he also contacted Cutcliffe last week. Cutcliffe was
in Shreveport, La., for the Independence Bowl between Mississippi and
Nebraska. When asked for comment about reports that he continues to
be a candidate for the Kentucky opening, Cutcliffe said, "Don't
bother me with that stuff right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado tailback Chris Brown says he expects to be back in full
force tonight when the No. 14 Buffaloes (9-4) play Wisconsin in the
Alamo Bowl in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The return of Brown, who suffered a bruised sternum in a Nov. 16
victory against Iowa State, is reason for concern among the Badgers
(7-6).</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big, physical back," Wisconsin defensive coordinator Kevin
Cosgrove said. "He breaks a lot of tackles, he has tremendous balance
and vision."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin also features a punishing ground game, centered around
sophomore Anthony Davis, who ran for 1,456 yards and 12 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers did receive some good news. Standout receiver Lee
Evans, who missed the season because of a knee injury, has decided to
return to the team next season rather than declare himself eligible
for the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   The news wasn't as good for Colorado. Safety Clyde Surrell was
declared academically ineligible and will not play tonight. Surrell
had 71 tackles and three sacks. Brian Iwuh will start in his place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia was packing its bags for the Gator Bowl, then along
came Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish took the spot West Virginia had earned as the
second-place team in the Big East, dropping the Mountaineers to the
Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   After early complaints over being passed over by the Gator Bowl,
15th-ranked West Virginia (9-3) knows it must beat Virginia (8-5)
today validate the early gripes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not supposed to be here, we're supposed to be in Florida,"
West Virginia running back Avon Cobourne said. "I had gotten over it
until I watched Pitt play [in the Insight Bowl] and I was mad again.
We should have been there, too.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's fine, we'll make our statement on the field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Vince Wilfork practiced with No. 1 Miami for the
first time since the death of his mother on Dec. 16. Wilfork leads
the Hurricanes with 15 tackles for losses and 29 quarterback hurries.</TE>

<HD>Kansas State Takes Ell Train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The oddsmakers should know better than to set an 18-point line for
the Holiday Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, favored Kansas State won, but not as easily as expected.</LD>
<LD>   Ell Roberson rallied the sixth-ranked Wildcats with three
fourth-quarter touchdowns, including a 10-yard pass to Derrick Evans
with 1:15 to play, for a 34-27 victory over Arizona State on Friday
night.</LD>
<TE>   Roberson also scored on runs of two yards and one yard in the
fourth quarter to add to the Holiday Bowl's history of wild finishes.
He accounted for four touchdowns overall, having also scored on a
32-yard run just before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll tell you he's had better games," Coach Bill Snyder
said. "But when it was on the line, he was very special."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State (11-2), the highest-ranked team not in a bowl
championship series game, trailed, 20-14, after three quarters and
seemed on the verge of what would have been a shocking upset.</TE>
<TE>   By then, though, Roberson was well on his way to leading a
16-play, 65-yard drive that took seven minutes 13 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   His two-yard plunge pulled the Wildcats into a 20-20 tie with
12:36 left in the fourth quarter, but they blew the extra point
because of a low snap.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State needed only 1:46 to go ahead, 27-20, on Andrew
Walter's 10-yard misdirection screen pass to Mike Williams, when the
quarterback rolled right and threw left. Walter completed six of
eight passes for 78 yards in the drive.</TE>
<TE>   But Roberson came back and led an 80-yard drive that he finished
with a one-yard sneak for a 27-27 tie with 6:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   All-American cornerback Terence Newman set up the winning score
with a 34-yard punt return. After a 10-yard holding penalty against
Kansas State was marched off, the Wildcats started the winning drive
on their 41.</TE>
<TE>   Roberson, the game's offensive MVP, passed to Evans on a slant
pattern for Kansas State's first lead of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get rid of it faster than I wanted to," Roberson said.
"I just laid it up there and he made a great catch."</TE>
<TE>   From 4:29 left in the third quarter until the winning touchdown
pass, Roberson completed eight of 12 passes for 127 yards, and ran
nine times for 44 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State had one last shot at the upset, but Walter's
desperation pass on fourth and 15 from his 49 was knocked down inside
the five.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the bowl matchups were set, the Sun Devils were
constantly reminded that the point spread was the biggest of all the
28 bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty irritated because coming out here today, we're the
biggest underdog of any bowl game being played," Walter said. "It was
fuel for the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State won its sixth consecutive game. It was the fifth time
in six seasons the Wildcats finished with 11 wins. Arizona State
(8-6) lost for the fourth time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we came out and laid an egg in the first half," Newman
said. "We got down but we played through it. That's what the No. 6
team in the nation is supposed to do in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   Roberson completed 11 of 28 passes for 215 yards, and rushed 18
times for 63 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Walter completed 28 of 57 passes for 293 yards and two touchdowns,
with one interception. The Sun Devils had only 17 yards rushing in 26
carries.</TE>

<HD>Pincay Remains at Top of Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laffit Pincay, who turns 56 Sunday, may be hard-pressed to blow out
all the candles. He rides in all but one of the nine races at Santa
Anita, and will be aboard David Copperfield in the $150,000 San
Gabriel Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Pincay also celebrated a 36th anniversary Thursday, opening day at
Santa Anita. On Dec. 26, 1966, Pincay, in the country for less than a
year, won his first race at the track. He since has won 3,478 more
there -- nearly 37% of his record total of 9,479.</LD>
<LD>   David Copperfield, who will carry 117 pounds, two less than the
top-weighted Decarchy, is Pincay's 23rd mount in the San Gabriel and
could give the hall-of-fame rider his fifth victory in the stake. He
hasn't won it since 1989 but just missed last year when Sligo Bay
lost by a head to Irish Prize.</LD>
<TE>   Pincay, a Panamanian, had won 447 races before moving to Chicago
in 1966. He spoke little English but had no trouble communicating
with horses. He won with his first U.S. mount, at Arlington Park.
Then almost six months later at Santa Anita, he broke in with a
victory aboard Riding Market.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no slowing down for Pincay, who broke Bill
Shoemaker's record of 8,833 victories at Hollywood Park on Dec. 10,
1999. Pincay was the leading rider late in the recent Hollywood Park
meet, then missed the last six days, five because of a suspension.
Even so, with 30 victories, he finished third, four behind Alex Solis
and Victor Espinosa, who tied for the title.</TE>
<TE>   During one of his days of not riding at Hollywood Park, Pincay
attended a day in his honor at Calder Race Course in South Florida.
The track had an auction for the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund and
items donated by or associated with Pincay brought in more than half
of the $15,000 in total proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay also rode several races at Calder, winning with a maiden
trained by Cam Gambolati. That was a reunion, of sorts. In 1985,
Gambolati hired Pincay to ride Spend A Buck in the Jersey Derby when
Angel Cordero wasn't available. Pincay won the race at Garden State
Park as Spend A Buck earned a $600,000 purse and a $2-million bonus
that went with winning the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   David Copperfield has won his last two starts with other jockeys
after returning from more than a year on the shelf. In his last
start, on Sept. 21, David Copperfield won the Bay Meadows Handicap,
which at 1 1/8 miles is the same distance as Sunday's race.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the 11-horse field are Seinne, White Heart and Decarchy,
who ran two-three-four, behind Good Journey, in the Citation Handicap
at Hollywood Park on Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, in pursuit of Wayne Lukas' one-year purse
record, has entered three -- Decarchy, Sumitas and Blue Stellar.
Jerry Bailey, who'll ride Decarchy, has 64 stakes victories this
year, four short of the record 68 that Mike Smith rode in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in two days Friday, a former claimer pulled an
upset in a stakes race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   About 24 hours after Debonair Joe, a $12,500 claim in September,
had shocked his rivals at 26-1 in the Malibu, Pocketfullofpesos, who
was claimed for $40,000 on Nov. 9, rallied from off the pace and won
the $125,000 California Breeders' Champion Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third win in four starts for the In Excess filly, who
was claimed by trainer Mike Mitchell for a partnership the day she
broke her maiden by six lengths at Hollywood Park. The California
Breeders' was her second victory for Mitchell. Three weeks ago in
Inglewood, she won a starter allowance race by six lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden for the first time by Patrick Valenzuela, Pocketfullofpesos
completed the seven furlongs in 1:23. Souvenir Copy, a 17-1 longshot,
was three lengths behind in second, and another 17-1 outsider, Denali
Cat, was third. Humorous Lady, the 13-10 favorite, faded to sixth
after setting a fast pace (22 and 44 1/5 for the half-mile).</TE>

<LD>Rashaun Woods put on another memorable show for Oklahoma State. The
only question left is was it his last.</LD>
<LD>   Woods, a junior who is considering declaring himself eligible for
the NFL draft, caught nine passes for 164 yards and a touchdown in
the Cowboys' 33-23 victory over Southern Mississippi in the Houston
Bowl on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll answer that question in the proper time," Woods said when
asked about his future.</LD>
<TE>   Woods helped the Cowboys complete a memorable season that included
victories over Nebraska, Texas A&amp;M and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, they made up their minds they weren't going
to let me do what I did in the first half and that really opened our
running game," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to stop the run and they did a good job of it early.
In the fourth quarter we started to wear them down."</TE>
<TE>   Tatum Bell ran for 160 yards in 13 carries, including a 22-yard
run with 8:07 left that gave Oklahoma State the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   "Running the ball was important for us today," Cowboy Coach Les
Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Phillips kicked two of his four field goals in the decisive
fourth quarter for the Cowboys (8-5).</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 20-13, at the half, Southern Mississippi (7-6) took its
only lead on a two-yard touchdown run by James Walley and a 30-yard
field goal by Curt Jones in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys pulled even on the first play of the fourth quarter on
Phillips' 28-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Fields threw for 310 yards, and his 33-yard pass to Billy
Bajema set up Bell's go-ahead touchdown, which put Oklahoma State
back in front, 30-23.</TE>
<TE>   After a punt by Southern Mississippi to the Oklahoma State two,
Bell broke off a career-long 88-yard run to the Golden Eagle 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the play started, I was just trying to move us out of the
two-yard line," Bell said. "But when it started, I saw a little
crease and my whole thought process changed."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State played in a bowl game for the first time since the
1997 Alamo Bowl, and won in the postseason for the first time since
Barry Sanders ran for 222 yards and five touchdowns in a 62-14
victory over Wyoming in the 1988 Holiday Bowl.</TE>

<LD>Glenn Davis Award winner Whitney Lewis of Ventura St. Bonaventure and
54 other California high school football players have been selected
to play in CaliFlorida Bowl IV on Jan. 4 at Mt. San Antonio College
in Walnut.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, a wide receiver who was selected the top player in the
Southland by The Times, will be joined by defensive back Dennis Keyes
of City Section champion Lake Balboa Birmingham, defensive lineman
Lawrence Jackson of Inglewood and running back Maurice Drew of
Concord De La Salle when California battles the top Florida players.
Kickoff is 11 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Florida's top players include Ernie Sims of Tallahassee North
Florida Christian, a 5-foot-11, 220-pound running back and linebacker
who is considered one of the nation's top prospects, and Antonio
Cromartie of Tallahassee Lincoln, a 6-3, 190-pound wide receiver and
defensive back.</LD>
<TE>   Florida, which won 34-24 last year, has a 2-1 lead in the series.
California won the inaugural game, 21-11, then lost 17-14 in the
second meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Other top Southland players on the roster include linebackers
Drean Rucker of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs and Michael Okwo of
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, defensive backs A.J. Tuitele of
Wilmington Banning and Desmond Reed of Temple City, wide receivers
B.J. Vickers of Venice and Mark Bradford of L.A. Fremont, defensive
linemen Sedrick Ellis of Chino, Junior Lemau'u of Long Beach Poly and
Brandon Mebane of L.A. Crenshaw, and quarterback Richard Irvin of
Pasadena Muir.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets, available through Ticketmaster, are $10 before Jan. 4 and
$12 at the gate.</TE>

<TE>   John Rodriguez had never forfeited a soccer game during his first
23 years of coaching, but he pulled his inury-depleted La Puente
Nogales boys' team out of the Huntington Beach Marina tournament
Thursday afternoon after suffering a 2-0 loss to Fullerton in the
first round that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Nogales (7-4-2), seventh in The Times' rankings at the start of
the week, was scheduled to play Los Angeles University in a
consolation game after losing to Fullerton. But Rodriguez felt his
team was too banged up to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We had five [starters] sitting out with injuries," Rodriguez said
of the Fullerton game. "I just felt it was best for our team to
withdraw after that. We need to heal up and start getting ready for
league play. We have to forget about records, rankings and all that.
We need to get healthy."</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Nogales won't practice again until Thursday.
The Nobles open San Antonio League play against visiting Walnut on
Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   When Maureece Rice of Philadelphia Strawberry Mansion High made a
three-point shot with less than two minutes left Friday, it not only
helped his team to a 76-63 victory over Olney, it gave him 2,209
career points to break Wilt Chamberlain's 47-year-old city record of
2,206.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, a 6-foot senior guard, has been on the varsity since his
freshman year. He averaged 32.1 points as a junior when he scored 63
points in a game. Chamberlain, who played three varsity seasons at
Overbrook, has three of the top four scoring marks in the city's
history, including a 90-point game in 1955, his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of good players have come through the Public League and
didn't break it," Rice said. "It feels great."</TE>

<HD>Nebraska Falls to Mississippi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHREVEPORT, La.</DL>
<LD>Nebraska has become a mediocre team -- and now the Cornhuskers have
the record to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Eli Manning threw for 313 yards and a touchdown as Mississippi
ended Nebraska's streak of having records above .500 at 40 seasons
with a 27-23 victory Friday in the Independence Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Nebraska managed only one offensive touchdown on Jammal Lord's
pass to Matt Herian in the second quarter. Josh Brown kicked three
field goals and DeJuan Groce had a punt return for a score.</LD>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers (7-7) had finished above .500 every season since
1961, when they went 3-6-1. Their seven losses this year are their
most since going 3-7 in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   "We all wanted to end this thing right. It did not happen,"
Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   Manning completed 25 of 44 passes for Mississippi (7-6) and became
the school's career passing leader.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska was No. 8 in the country after a 3-0 start, but the
Cornhuskers startling demise prompted Solich to make sweeping changes
to his coaching staff after the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Solich fired his defensive coordinator and two other defensive
assistants and said he will hire an offensive coordinator next
season. Solich has acted as offensive coordinator since taking over
for Tom Osborne in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We were well prepared for this game. Our coaches did a great job
of getting us ready to play," said Nebraska defensive end Chris
Kelsay.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska had its option working in the first half with 207 of its
262 rushing yards.</TE>
<TE>   But Mississippi adjusted in the second half and held Nebraska to
97 yards and no touchdowns. Dahrann Diedrick had 92 rushing yards and
Lord had 176 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew coming into the game we were going to have to adjust to
their offense," Mississippi linebacker Eddie Strong said. "I could
tell they weren't as physical as they were in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   The win enabled the Rebels to avoid their first losing season
since 1996. It was their third Independence Bowl victory in five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi was clinging to a 24-23 lead before Jonathan Nichols
made a 43-yard field goal with 4:30 left.</TE>

<LD>Less than $189,000 shy of Wayne Lukas' 14-year-old record of
$17,842,358 in stable earnings, trainer Bobby Frankel could be the
record holder by the end of today's racing.</LD>
<LD>   A cinch to win his third consecutive Eclipse award as the
country's top trainer, Frankel will send out the favored entry of
Peace Rules and Bis Repetitas in the $75,000-added Hill Rise Stakes
and 7-5 choice You in the $200,000 La Brea Stakes at Santa Anita. In
addition, he will be represented by More Modern, at 6-1, in the
eighth, a $62,500 claimer with a $52,000 purse. Victories in the
three races will put Frankel over the top.</LD>
<LD>   The first leg of the La Canada series for fillies, the
seven-furlong La Brea attracted 10 others, including the slumping
Habibti and comebacker Bella Bellucci.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of five Grade I races since being purchased privately by
Frankel for owner Ed Gann, You will try for another in the La Brea
before she begins a vacation. The daughter of You And I has had
success at Santa Anita, winning the Las Virgenes and Santa Anita Oaks
earlier in the year. She is also one for one at the distance, having
taken a memorable Test Stakes by a nose over Carson Hollow in what
might have been the best race of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Idle since finishing second to Take Charge Lady in the Spinster at
Keeneland on Oct. 6, You will break from the inside.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Santa Anita is a $52,000 allowance
at 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf; pick three and pick six players will
be spreading the wide-open contest with a full field of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Frank Laboccetta and Robert Barbara. The two trainers
started Aqueduct a combined 10 for 18.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Uriel Lopez. The jockey is five for 158 at Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling the Bis Repetitas-Peace
Rules entry in the third, Pohave in the fourth and using all in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/2. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $5.40/$12.60. Total money bet: $34.</TE>

<HD>Not Down and Out</HD>
<DH>Relegated to third option at receiver, Kelly kept working
hard and may have improved his NFL stock</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>USC receiver Kareem Kelly could not help sneaking a peek over the
fence during the Trojans' first official Orange Bowl practice on
Friday. The lure was too great.</LD>
<LD>   The Miami Dolphins' training complex sits only a short pass away
from where USC is preparing for Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   "I just picture myself practicing on one of those fields,
competing against grown men," Kelly said. "I'm focusing on the Orange
Bowl game, but I put myself in a situation where I say, 'I might be
here next year.'</LD>
<TE>   "You never know."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly possessed NFL talent when he arrived at USC from Long Beach
Poly High as a freshman in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Work ethic and attitude were the question marks during and after
his first three seasons. Kelly addressed the former by preparing
zealously for his senior year and by practicing hard throughout it.
He answered the latter by handling, without any outward signs of
complaint, the emergence of freshman receiver Mike Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how things work out. Kelly thought he was going to be the
man this season.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he became one.</TE>
<TE>   "He really has matured," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, Kelly might have achieved a rare feat for a
receiver: improving his potential NFL draft position by catching the
fewest passes of his career. Williams has 75 receptions, a Pacific 10
Conference freshman record. Junior flanker Keary Colbert has 65
catches, 31 more than last season. Kelly, who averaged nearly 53
receptions in his first three seasons, has caught 43 passes.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that we're winning, and that's
something I didn't get to experience a lot of at 'SC before this
year," Kelly said a few days after the Trojans completed their 10-2
regular season. "My blocking got better and so did my route-running.
I still need work on all parts of my game, but after going through
what I have this season, I'm prepared better for the next level."</TE>
<TE>   The road to selflessness was not always easy for Kelly, who has
201 receptions in his career and needs one more to become the
Trojans' all-time leader.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could have played the role Mike Williams played," Kelly
said. "I had to look in the mirror a few mornings and tell myself
that everything was going to be all right. I looked at it like, 'Mike
is their future.' "</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when elder Trojan receivers said the same thing
about Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he produced what was then the best freshman season by a
receiver in Pac-10 history. Playing most of the season behind
Windrell Hayes, he caught 54 passes for 902 yards and four
touchdowns. He eclipsed 100 yards in four games and averaged a
team-best 16.7 yards a catch en route to being named the conference's
freshman of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Kelly started eight of 11 games and caught a team-best 55
passes for 796 yards and four touchdowns. He sat out a game against
Arizona because of the sprained ankle and strained hamstring, the
only game in which he didn't catch a pass in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the first under Carroll and offensive coordinator
Norm Chow, he caught 49 passes for 801 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to finish with a flourish, Kelly dedicated himself to the
most intense off-season workout regimen of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to be the guy," he said. "I just felt I
deserved to be the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly held the role at the outset. He caught six passes for 66
yards and a touchdown in the Trojans' season-opening victory over
Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams had a team-high seven receptions in a rout over
Colorado. Colbert had a career-best 11 receptions in a loss against
Kansas State, and Williams was called on repeatedly despite numerous
critical drops against the Wildcats.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kansas State game opened my eyes," Kelly said. "It showed me
my role had changed."</TE>
<TE>   A few days after the game, Kelly sought out Chow.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me, 'Where do I fit in?' " Chow recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty straightforward," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Chow told Kelly that at 6 feet 5, Williams was going to get the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I also told Kareem that there were three receivers, and he had to
contribute the best way he could, whether it was catching balls,
blocking or whatever," Chow said.</TE>
<TE>   As the season went on, Williams established himself as one of the
most productive receivers in the nation. He had more than 100 yards
receiving in five games, including 226 against Oregon. Meanwhile,
Kelly failed to register a 100-yard game for the first time in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned because we had to be in the same meeting rooms
and we see each other on a daily basis," Williams said. "You need the
support of the guys in your group because they are the ones that take
care of you.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Kareem is, he had already proved himself as a
big-time player. He's been a mentor on and off the field. But the one
thing he didn't have was a winning season like this. In one way or
another, my play helped us get that."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, so did Kelly's.</TE>
<TE>   Against UCLA, he made a leaping 34-yard touchdown catch 16 seconds
into the game that started the Trojans on their way to a 52-21 rout.
He also had a 41-yard reception that set up a 34-yard scoring reverse
by Colbert in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the regular-season finale against Notre Dame, Kelly caught
three passes for 12 yards as the Trojans completed their best regular
season since 1988. In the process, he also extended to 47 his streak
of games with a reception.</TE>
<TE>   "Kareem wasn't selfish about it -- he knew all he had to do was
play," quarterback Carson Palmer said. "He had a great year and
helped us get where we are."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Kelly concludes his career against Iowa. A big
individual performance would be a nice way to finish.</TE>
<TE>   A victory better.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing about this season is that we're here in
a BCS game," he said. "I get another chance to show my true character
again, a chance to make plays if my number is called.</TE>
<TE>   "But the best thing is that I'll be out there and be excited with
my team."</TE>

<LD>Rookie Alexander Frolov left Friday's practice early after suffering
a nasty cut on his right cheek, the result of an inadvertent high
stick, and defenseman Mattias Norstrom hobbled off because of a groin
injury.</LD>
<LD>   Both, however, are expected to be on board today when the Kings
fly to Denver for Sunday's game against the Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   That's the good news.</LD>
<TE>   As for the bad:</TE>
<TE>   * Jason Allison, sidelined the last two games, was put on the
injured-reserve list, making him ineligible to test his damaged right
knee until Monday night against the Chicago Blackhawks, at the
earliest.</TE>
<TE>   * Bryan Smolinski, whose left eye was scratched by a high stick in
Thursday's overtime victory over the Phoenix Coyotes, was told he
shouldn't fly today, so he won't be in the Pepsi Center on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   * Adam Deadmarsh probably won't make the trip, Coach Andy Murray
said, but a final determination won't be made until after this
morning's practice. Because of dizziness, he hasn't played since Dec.
15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jerred Smithson, recalled from the Kings' American Hockey
League team at Manchester, N.H., is expected to make his NHL debut
Sunday, joining rookies Michael Cammalleri, Joe Corvo and Frolov in a
makeshift lineup.</TE>
<TE>   None were with the Kings in Denver last spring when they met the
Avalanche in the playoffs. Neither were Kip Brennan, Brad Norton,
Derek Armstrong, Dmitry Yushkevich, Chris McAlpine or Erik Rasmussen,
who probably will sit out because of a back injury.</TE>

<HD>With It Tense, Jackson Is Focused on Present</HD>

<LD>If you thought the Lakers were ready to panic after losing 19 of
their first 30 games, think again.</LD>
<LD>   "We're either as good as we were when we won three championships
or else we weren't any good when we won," Coach Phil Jackson said
after Friday's practice at El Segundo. "After playing, what, 40 or 50
games in playoff style against the rest of this league? Everybody
kind of sets up what they are going to do, as far as a pattern to
beat the champs. When that pattern is established everybody copies
it."</LD>
<LD>   So instead of making .500 an immediate goal, Jackson is simply
trying to get the Lakers to "take it one game at a time."</LD>
<TE>   "We just want to get to the new year," he said. "We're just saying
that we refuse to lose that 20th game, instead of trying to start
over again.... What I'm trying to do is take away the process of
looking and saying, 'If we can get back to.... ' Well, to get back to
.500 is a long ways off. That could be two months off.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not what it's about. It's about starting today and playing
from today on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lakers were upbeat following Friday's workout, they
lacked the swagger they had three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were in a definite state of denial for a period of
time," forward Rick Fox said. "Our championships over the last three
years [may] have meant something to all of us individually and
collectively as a group, [but] they mean nothing to our opponents
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year is a new start, so when you lose to teams for whatever
reason ... we had [an excuse] to fall back on, whether it's injuries
to suspensions. We got caught into that. When we got all back
together again, the losses then became, 'Oh, that's just Golden
State' or, 'That's just so-and-so.'</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're off of denial and we understand that we have a long,
long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker did not practice because of tonsillitis and did not
travel with the team to Denver for tonight's game against the
Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Walker will also miss Sunday's game against Toronto at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad for Samaki," Jackson said of Walker, who had eight
points and nine rebounds in the Lakers' loss to Sacramento on
Wednesday. "He was just starting to play well for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Denver, 6 PST, Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330), KIRN (670).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 11-19, Nuggets 6-22.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Nuggets  (2001-02) 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Denver has lost eight consecutive games, three of those
at home. Juwan Howard is coming off a 30-point effort in a loss to
the Clippers on Dec. 21. Although the Lakers rank 23rd in the league
in shooting percentage, they're ninth in assists with 22.43 a game.</TE>

<LD>Envious wretches as we are here in Bakersfield, we watch in awe as
the sports scene each season develops in Los Angeles. We agonize with
you as you handle the problems of the many sports entities wending
their way through whatever it is.</LD>
<LD>   We are aghast, though, at a new tone emerging in a letter to The
Times [Dec. 21] regarding the Lakers and their management, especially
Mr. Buss and Mr. Jackson. A Mr. Campbell from Glendale (which we
always considered very sophisticated) espouses offering up one's
daughters to Mr. Jackson to atone for the lack of enthusiasm of his
minions this season.</LD>
<LD>   This is a pretty awful suggestion and we expect that you will be
deluged by letters of protest, especially from the Athletic Division
of the NOW gang. Looking forward to your smooth work to come in this
matter.</LD>

<LD>Another day of NFL action last Sunday, but you couldn't tell from the
pictures shown in the Times' Monday sports pages [Dec. 23]. The Times
printed an amazing five pictures of players in various states of
preening and celebration, with only one picture of players actually
playing.</LD>
<LD>   I've read many Times writers bemoan the movement toward the modern
"look-at-me" athlete. Yet the photography seems to be part of the
problem, not the solution.</LD>

There is a serious case over at Pauley Pavilion every time they allow

<TE>   Someone should intervene and save him the embarrassment and
humiliation of having to watch Steve Lavin coach his old team. He
signs autographs and clenches his program but he can only take so
much before he is permanently harmed. It's just not fair to let a
92-year-old man be subjected to such treatment.</TE>

<LD>With all due respect to Tim Leiweke [Dec. 19], his logic in claiming
the Kings are losing money has as many holes as the new netting
behind the goals. Why did billionaire owner Philip Anschutz even
purchase the team if he has no inclination to spend the necessary
dollars to acquire the top-level talent who will carry the team to
the next level and the Stanley Cup?</LD>
<LD>   It is all well and good to want to impress your fellow owners and
stay within the corporate spending limits, but the fans want a winner
and not an also-ran. Does George Steinbrenner care if the other
baseball owners are upset when he signs a high-priced free agent? No,
because it is a competition and the desired end result is the
championship.</LD>
<LD>   If Anschutz and Leiweke are serious about bringing a Stanley Cup
to Los Angeles, they need to stop complaining about the system and
start competing within it, as other successful teams have been able
to do. If they insist on claiming poverty and using the Kings as a
tax write-off, do us all a favor and sell the franchise to an owner
who truly wants to win and will do whatever it takes to succeed.</LD>

<TE>   This week's Las Vegas Bowl was well suited to its surrealistic
host city: two pretender teams with barely a 50% win record, a failed
trans-gender attempt by a kicker, a non-coach who spent the regular
season imitating a helicopter on the sidelines to stir up sleepy
attendees, a long-standing coach who was dismissed before the game,
and a newly hired coach who didn't even attend the game.</TE>

males with a talent for kicking a football play regularly on Division
I-A football teams, not to mention the NFL. Or that any number of
these kickers have had an occasional PAT blocked, sometimes with the
game on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, focus on the shame and disgrace -- not of Coach Rocky
Long's decision to use Katie Hnida in a bowl game, but of columnist
Diane Pucin's use [Dec. 26] of tired words like "won't" and "can't"
to dismiss the dreams of countless would-be athletes.</TE>

<HD>Focusing on Losing Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laker loss to the Sacramento Kings [Dec. 25] points out a common
theme in understanding the team's futility this season: Simply put,
the Lakers are just not making their shots (loss of focus) and their
porous defense (loss of focus) has led to an increased number of
turnovers (loss of focus).</LD>
<LD>   Also, after winning three consecutive championships, they have
become fat (no pun intended) and do not seem to have the same desire
(loss of focus) they had in the three previous seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who knows NBA history is well aware that the last team to
win four championships in a row was the Boston Celtics, back in the
'60s. The difference between that team and the teams of today is,
back then they played for more than fortune and fame: They played for
pride. Today's champs do not play for pride, they just get fat and
lose focus.</LD>

<TE>   What's wrong with the Lakers? Three years ago Phil Jackson came
here like Samson of old and for three years he slew all of the
Philistines confronting his team.</TE>
<TE>   Then, like the Samson of old, he underwent some very unfortunate
barbering -- and that's why every ass in the league who possesses a
jawbone is now beating up on him and his players!</TE>
<TE>   Grow it back, Phil -- and when the facial hair returns, so will
the victories.</TE>

<TE>   Jack Kent Cooke was correct in getting rid of those Laker white
home jerseys before the 1967-68 season. The reasoning? He said
everybody would have color television by the end of that decade. If
the Lakers want to go retro, why don't they move back to the Forum or
Sports Arena (hey, maybe that's not a bad idea -- the upper-level
seats were closer to the court and the parking was easier).</TE>

<LD>If any of those boys who played for McDermott Northwest and Waverly
play in the Super Bowl, they will never accomplish anything as
football players as important as they did when they allowed Jake
Porter to score a touchdown on Oct. 18 ["Run of the Chill," Dec. 25].</LD>
<LD>   As sports enthusiasts, we get caught up in rivalries and forget
that games are really nothing more than a celebration of life and
that the result is far less important than the participation. When I
saw Jake's touchdown on the sports highlights that night, the
humanity of the players and coaches of both teams, and the visible
joy in Jake's stride, brought tears to my eyes. Your story brought
those back.</LD>

<HD>Stotts Is a Winner in His Hawk Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after giving Jason Terry an earful for an untimely turnover,
Coach Terry Stotts drew up a play for Terry to win the game.</LD>
<LD>   It worked perfectly.</LD>
<LD>   Terry scored on a fallaway jumper at the buzzer to give Stotts a
victory in his debut as the Atlanta Hawks beat the San Antonio Spurs,
81-79, on Friday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Stotts, a longtime assistant who joined the team this summer, took
over for Lon Kruger, who was fired Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing as it sounds, that's the way I drew it up," Stotts said.
"You've got to love shooters. I'm glad this one dropped, because this
team needed a confidence-builder. It's been a rough stretch."</TE>
<TE>   After Tim Duncan tied the score with a hook from in close, Terry
took an inbound pass with 4.3 seconds left and dribbled past Tony
Parker and Bruce Bowen. He hoisted an off-balance, line-drive
18-footer just before the final horn, and the ball swished through.</TE>
<TE>   Terry's teammates mobbed him at halfcourt, and the referees
immediately ruled the shot was good. They used a video replay
afterward to officially count the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my head down a couple times and he came right to me," Terry
said of Stotts. "I made mistakes, but he stuck with me and showed
confidence in me."</TE>
<TE>   And the final play?</TE>
<TE>   "He drew it up. What can I say?" Terry said.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 103, Utah 98 -- Scottie Pippen scored a season-high 23
points at Portland as the Trail Blazers won their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson scored 16 points for the Trail Blazers, who have
their longest winning streak since winning 12 in a row last year.
Pippen added eight rebounds and five assists, and Wallace nine
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 113, Chicago 100 -- Kevin Garnett had his third
triple-double of the season, and Radoslav Nesterovic scored a
season-high 23 points at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls' four-game home winning streak, their longest in almost
five years, came to an end.</TE>
<TE>   New York 99, Houston 83 -- Charlie Ward scored all nine of his
points during a key fourth-quarter run for the Knicks at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks used a 16-2 run early in the final period to open up an
82-62 lead, New York's largest of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 90, Boston 70 -- Eddie Jones scored 28 points and Heat
reserve Vladimir Stepania had 14 points and 14 rebounds at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics shot only 27.8% from the field, on 22-of-79 shooting
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 110, Milwaukee 90 -- Kenyon Martin got New Jersey going
with two fastbreak dunks early in the third quarter and the Nets
rolled to their 12th straight home win at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 101, Toronto 96 -- Earl Boykins, Golden State's 5-5
reserve guard, scored the final 10 points for the Warriors in the
last 3:40, including six free throws in the final 30 seconds to
finish with 16 points at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 99, Orlando 86 -- Mike Batiste scored 13 points, including
eight in the fourth quarter, as the Grizzly reserves led a
fourth-quarter comeback at Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic led by as many as 13 and held a 10-point lead early in
the second half, but the Grizzlies reserves scored 11 straight to
erase an early fourth-quarter deficit as Memphis took an 88-78 lead.
Memphis' starters remained on the bench the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 113, Cleveland 89 -- Reggie Miller made three
three-pointers in a 56-second span of the third quarter to restore
Indiana's lead, and the Pacers rolled to a win at Cleveland.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staples Center President Tim Leiweke, determined to stage the Sept.
13 boxing rematch between Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley, will ask
Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn to join the effort.</LD>
<LD>   Promoter Bob Arum raised the idea of civic aid in a Friday meeting
with Leiweke in Las Vegas after Leiweke had offered $7 million to $8
million to land the fight. Two Las Vegas hotel-casinos, Mandalay Bay
and the MGM Grand, are also in the bidding.</LD>
<LD>   Staples Center paid a site fee of $5.5 million for the first De La
Hoya-Mosley fight in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "We came out with our guns blazing," Leiweke said of Friday's
meeting. "We cut to the chase and made the largest offer ever for a
boxing match in L.A. But we are going to need help out of the mayor's
office. We are going to ask them to put their resources behind this,
using their assets and their marketing and promotional vehicles,
making this a big event for Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Arum said he would be making the same request of the Las Vegas
Convention Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not asking for public funds to promote the fight," he
said. "We are asking for a commitment to promote the city in
conjunction with the fight."</TE>
<TE>   There was no one in Hahn's office available for immediate
response.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is hotel rooms. Those come as part of the package in
Las Vegas. Leiweke, on the other hand, will have to negotiate with
downtown hotels in Los Angeles for cut rates for the fighters, their
entourages, promotional personnel, boxing officials and visiting
media.</TE>
<TE>   Arum said he would talk further with Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand
officials, but insisted he would not "turn this into an auction."</TE>
<TE>   A final decision, said Arum, may not be made until February.</TE>

<TE>   Serena Williams, who won three of tennis' four Grand Slam
tournaments and 56 of 61 matches overall, was honored as the
Associated Press female athlete of the year.</TE>
<TE>   She received 53 first-place votes and 351 points from Associated
Press member newspapers and broadcasters across the country. Golfer
Annika Sorenstam was next, with 27 first-place votes and 193 points,
followed by Olympic champion figure skater Sarah Hughes, 12 and 158.</TE>
<TE>   "My game has matured, and mentally, I've just matured to another
level," Williams said. "That is a major factor in it. Some people
mature really late."</TE>
<TE>   She turned 21 in September.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in only 13 tournaments, Williams won a tour-best eight
titles and took home a record $3.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was a runner-up twice and never missed gaining the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam won 11 of her 23 events on the LPGA Tour, finishing out
of the top 10 only three times.</TE>
<TE>   She set records for lowest scoring average, 68.7, and earnings,
$2.8 million.</TE>

<HD>Giants Versus Jets Would Be a Trip</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A subway Super Bowl?</LD>
<LD>   Well, that might be a reach. But, for the first time in 16 years
and only the third time in NFL history, the Giants and Jets are both
still in the playoff hunt heading into the final weekend of games. If
the Giants beat Philadelphia today, they're in. The Jets can win the
AFC East if they beat Green Bay on Sunday, and New England beats
Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "The way we're both playing is getting people excited about the
possibilities," Giant General Manager Ernie Accorsi said. "I think
they see that we're both hot teams right now. Both teams are alive,
same weekend, same stadium, same field."</LD>
<TE>   Here's how the New York teams match up:</TE>
<TE>   OWNERS</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- Wellington Mara's family has owned the team since 1925,
and he can remember the days when Vince Lombardi was a Giant
assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- Woody Johnson is in his third season as owner and has a
firm grasp of the Al Groh era.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   KEY COACHING MOVES</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- The team has won six of eight since Jim Fassel took over
the playcalling after a loss at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- Herman Edwards, who delivered a tearful speech on the
importance of never giving up, made his best decision as a coach when
he gave up on Vinny Testaverde in favor of Chad Pennington.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Jets.</TE>
<TE>   UNDERRATED PLAYER</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- Linebacker Brandon Short. He wears No. 53, the same
number as Giant great Harry Carson, and he's the type of tackler who
would fit in well with that swarming defense of the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- Receiver Laveranues Coles. He has great hands and runs
crisp routes. Most important, he's one of the toughest guys on the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Jets.</TE>
<TE>   RECORD UNDER BILL PARCELLS</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- From 1983 through '90, Parcells was 77-49-1 with the
G-men, and 8-3 in the postseason -- including Super Bowl victories in
1986 and '90.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- A lighter, blonder Parcells coached the Jets to a 29-19
record from 1997 through '99.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   MOST KNUCKLEHEADED PLAY</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- Holding a 7-0 lead at Arizona with 14 seconds left in
the first half, the Giants took over on their own 24. Instead of
running out the clock, they got greedy. An errant pass by Kerry
Collins was intercepted at the 38 by Justin Lucas and run back for a
touchdown, a pivotal play in a 21-7 victory by the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- After complaining he wasn't getting the ball enough,
receiver Wayne Chrebet caught a pass late in a game against Chicago
and tried to hurdle four Bear defenders. He looked like Jerry Rice on
the way up, Jerry Lewis on the way down. In order to stick the
landing, he had to let go of the ball -- and the ballgame. The Jets
lost.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: None -- the plays were equally idiotic.</TE>
<TE>   MOST NEWSWORTHY RADIO PERSONALITY</TE>
<TE>   Giants -- Rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey made headlines over his
insensitive comments about gays on the Howard Stern show, then was
fired from his own radio show on WFAN when he twice failed to call in
on time.</TE>
<TE>   Jets -- General Manager Terry Bradway has his own show on Mondays,
and, even in the worst of times, takes calls from Jet fans. Give him
credit for that.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Giants.</TE>
<TE>   So will these teams wind up meeting in San Diego next month? For
that, I'll steal a line from Parcells, who responded to an especially
dumb question with this gem:</TE>
<TE>   Is LSD back?</TE>
<TE>   Around the NFL</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Tom Brady is no Brett Favre. And, in this case, that's
a good thing. Unlike Favre, who slid at the feet of Michael Strahan
last season and essentially gave the New York Giant the single-season
sack record, Brady won't be taking a dive Sunday against Miami's
Jason Taylor. With 18 1/2 sacks, Taylor is four short of Strahan's
record. Taylor said breaking that record was one of the personal
goals he set before the season. "It's not something I walk around
talking about, and I'm not going to come in here and say I'm going to
get it," he told reporters. "But you always want to be the best.
That's part of it. Some of the goals I've set for myself I've passed.
So the last few weeks, I had to set some new ones. We'll see what
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's Drew Bledsoe has cooled considerably in the second half
of the season. Compared to his first eight games, his last seven have
included a plunge in completion percentage, from 64% to 57%; average
passing yardage, from 287 to 232; touchdowns, from 16 to seven; and
quarterback rating, from 98.3 to 68.5. The only number that has
risen? Interceptions, from five to 10.</TE>
<TE>   Aptly named Dolphin guard Jamie Nails tore an Achilles' tendon
against the Raiders and stayed on the field two or three more plays
before hobbling to the sideline. Then, last week, he left a South
Florida hospital about an hour after having surgery on his knees and
his Achilles', even though medical personnel advised him to stay. "I
don't really like hospitals," Nails explained to reporters. "I had
surgery in high school on my knee and had to stay for a month because
I had a staph infection. This time, once I was ready to move around,
I got ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- Tim Couch has won only 30% of his games (18-42) as
Cleveland's starting quarterback in the last four seasons, yet 10 of
those victories have come after the Browns have been tied or behind
in the fourth quarter. "I think that's a sign that a quarterback
wants to be known for," Couch said. "To be able to bring his team
back when everything is against you." Couch's biggest comeback
challenge will be winning back those people whose confidence in him
is dwindling by the day.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Pittsburgh Coach Bill
Cowher was asked if his team would put in a claim on Deion Sanders,
considering starting cornerback Chad Scott has a broken hand. "No,"
Cowher said, "we're going to pass." Within three hours, the Steelers
had put a claim in on Sanders, joining four other AFC teams blocking
the star player's path to the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James needs 97
yards rushing Sunday to reach 1,000 and collect a $1.38-million
bonus. He's coming off his worst performance of the season, a
10-carry, 13-yard debacle against the Giants. He has been slowed by
injuries all season -- two sprained ankles, a pulled hamstring and
pulled rib muscles -- and he hasn't looked close to the back who was
so dominant a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Colts have struggled. Not only have they lost two of
three, but have lost control of the division to Tennessee. Their path
to the playoffs is clear-cut, though. If they beat Jacksonville in
their finale, they're in as the fifth-seeded wild-card team. Since
arriving in Indianapolis in 1984, the Colts are 4-1 when their season
hangs in the balance in the final week.</TE>
<TE>   But making the playoffs as a wild-card team is no easy road. Since
the NFL went to a 12-team playoff format in 1990, a fifth or
sixth-seeded team has never made it to the Super Bowl. Baltimore and
Denver recently won the Super Bowl as No. 4 seeds.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the history of the Tennessee/Houston
franchise, the team has a 3,000-yard passer (Steve McNair), a
1,000-yard rusher (Eddie George) and a 1,000-yard receiver (Derrick
Mason). The club has been around for 43 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- It looks as if Dan Marino can breathe easy. His
single-season yardage record appears to be safe. Rich Gannon would
need to roll up 475 yards passing against Kansas City today to break
Marino's mark of 5,084 -- a gargantuan task, even against the
league's worst-ranked pass defense. Gannon was on track until two
weeks ago, when he threw for 204 yards in a loss to the Dolphins,
then followed that with 201 yards in a victory over Denver. Second
place in the record books is well within his reach, though. He needs
221 yards to surpass Kurt Warner, who rolled up 4,830 yards for St.
Louis in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A Raider to watch is cornerback Clarence Love, who was released by
the Ravens in 2001 and spent much of the last year working in his
family's barbershop in Jackson, Mich. He has gotten a lot more
playing time than anyone expected because of injuries to starting
corners Charles Woodson and Tory James, and rookie standout Phillip
Buchanon. Few people expected Love to make it out of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "He was basically the 53rd player on our [53-man] roster," Coach
Bill Callahan said. "Everyone at the time wondered why we kept
Clarence Love. But we saw enough in training camp to know he had
speed and cover ability. He may be short on size, but he's been a
surprise for us."</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- Dallas' Emmitt Smith is a mere 38 yards away from his
12th consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season. He should pick up those
yards against the Redskins, but it probably will be his last game as
a Cowboy. Under his current deal, he has a $7-million base salary for
next season and a $9.8-million cap number. That's far too steep for a
34-year-old running back, even if he is the leading rusher in NFL
history.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's Bruce Smith had two sacks against Houston last
Sunday, giving him eight for the season. He has 194 sacks in 18
seasons, leaving him four short of Reggie White's league record. It's
unlikely Smith will reach that milestone against the Cowboys, even
though he had two sacks against them earlier this season. He'll be 40
next season, and there's no guarantee he'll be back. Too bad he isn't
playing against Favre this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Chicago will be outmanned against Tampa Bay, but
don't write off the Bears just yet. The Buccaneers have lost eight of
their last 10 road games against Chicago, after all, and have never
won in freezing weather.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson is usually soft-spoken and
reserved. But even he couldn't bite his tongue this week in
discussing his 53-yard field goal that beat Miami, 20-17 -- and
former Viking Cris Carter -- Dec. 21. The kick came moments after
Carter dropped what might have been the winning touchdown pass. As
Anderson was lining up, TV cameras caught Carter on the sideline
shaking his head and apparently assuring teammates that Anderson
didn't have the leg to make the kick. "Here he is, a minute [after]
dropping that game-winning touchdown," Anderson said. "And then, in
true CC fashion: 'He can't make that kick. He can't make it.' And
then to see his face, his eyes following the ball, to see his face,
it was good."</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Jim Haslett will never admit it, but his staggering
Saints look a lot like they did at the end of last season when they
lost their last four games by a combined 160-52. How else do you
reconcile losing to Minneapolis at the Superdome, then doing a face
plant against Cincinnati? That loss to the Bengals really stung,
especially because the Saints had ample opportunities to seize
control but couldn't take advantage of four turnovers and a slew of
penalties by Cincinnati. Rookie guard LeCharles Bentley hasn't been
in the league long, but he recognized an embarrassing moment when he
saw one. "Everybody's still in shock," he told reporters. "We just
lost to the Bengals. It's like if I were still at Ohio State and we
lost to Akron or something. That's not supposed to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Bentley, a second-round pick, has turned into an All-Pro quote.
Asked about his season-opening assignment, blocking Tampa Bay's
Warren Sapp, he told the New Orleans Times-Picayune: "You hear so
much about the guy that it just works up into a frenzy. You start to
think this guy is unstoppable, nobody in the league can block him.
But to actually get out there.... I walk up to the line and think,
'You can't be for real.' But after that first play, it all went out
the window. After that, he was just another victim. My parents always
told me you've got to bully a bully. After a while, he didn't want
anymore of us. After a while, he wanted to play linebacker."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci isn't too pleased
about having to play a Monday night game immediately before the
playoffs start. The 49ers finish the season at St. Louis. "It's 36
hours less recovery time than everybody else," he said. "It's a short
week, and I'm wondering -- I don't make these decisions -- but I'm
wondering if a Monday night game should be played that [final] week.
It could well have been both us and the Rams in the playoffs....
Let's face it, it's a disadvantage to have a day-and-a-half less
time."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in his career as an NFL head coach, Mike
Holmgren is dealing with job insecurity. Word is, Seahawk owner Paul
Allen might ask Holmgren to give up some of his control over
personnel so he can focus on coaching. But Holmgren might be too
proud to let go of that. After all, if he doesn't have that control,
what's left? A $16-million golden parachute, you say?</TE>
<TE>   Poor guy.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Rk  Team (Rec.)            Comment (last week's rank)

                           (1)
2   OAKLAND  (10-5)        Raiders proved last Sunday they can run
                           when necessary. (5)

4   PITTSBURGH  (9-5-1)    Here's a first: Cowher gave his players

5   TAMPA BAY  (11-4)      Rob Johnson should get a chance to show
                           what he can do. (3)
6   MIAMI (9-6)            New England's bitter cold. Could this be a
                           rerun of the Buffalo whiteout? (4)
7   TENNESSEE  (10-5)      The Titans boast a plus-18 sack
                           differential. (8)
8   SAN FRANCISCO  (10-5)  It's 49ers and Rams, but will anyone be
                           watching? (10)
9   ATLANTA  (9-5-1)       Falcons are looking horrible in the red
                           zone. (11)
10  N.Y. JETS  (8-7)       Unbelievable: Jet injury report Wednesday

11  DENVER  (8-7)          With the way he's been playing, Griese has

12  N.Y. GIANTS  (9-6)     Giants have averaged 34.2 points in last

                           Saints are gagging. (9)
14  NEW ENGLAND  (8-7)     Weather should weigh heavily in Patriots'
                           favor Sunday. (13)
15  INDIANAPOLIS  (9-6)    Where is the killer instinct, Colts? (6)
16  KANSAS CITY  (8-7)     Without Priest Holmes, this is a vastly
                           different offense. (16)
17  BUFFALO  (7-8)         Bledsoe is going through a typical
                           late-season swoon. (17)
18  SEATTLE  (6-9)         Matt Hasselbeck is looking for his fourth
                           300-yard passing game in last six. (20)
19  SAN DIEGO  (8-7)       Looks as if Chargers will have time to
                           help with Super Bowl decorations. (14)
20  MINNESOTA  (5-10)      It's official: Mike Tice is back for next
                           season. (27)
21  BALTIMORE  (7-8)       Even if Ravens miss the playoffs, Billick
                           is a coach-of-the-year candidate. (19)
22  CLEVELAND  (8-7)       Tim Couch is at his best when Browns are
                           trailing. (22)
23  JACKSONVILLE  (6-9)    Wide receiver Jimmy Smith has disappeared
                           of late. (23)
24  WASHINGTON  (6-9)      The Redskins are 0-5 in the NFC  East. (26)
25  CAROLINA  (6-9)        Panthers are ready to take another look at
                           Randy Fasani. (24)
26  ST. LOUIS  (6-9)       A glimmer of good news: Marc Bulger's back
                           injury won't require surgery. (21)
27  DETROIT  (3-12)        Mike McMahon could be auditioning for his
                           future with the Lions. (28)
28  ARIZONA  (5-10)        The burning question: Should the Cardinals
                           keep Jake Plummer? (30)
29  CHICAGO  (4-11)        Bears will be happy to bid adieu to
                           Champaign. (29)
30  DALLAS (5-10)          Emmitt won't be around to see if Parcells
                           can make a difference. (25)
31  CINCINNATI  (2-13)     By beating Saints, Bengals took a break in
                           their pursuit of No. 1 pick. (32)
32  HOUSTON  (4-11)        Texans are looking greener by the week.

<TE>   **** Philadelphia (12-3) at New York Giants (9-6), 10:30 a.m.,
Channel 11, KNX (1070): Since scoring three points in an Oct. 28 loss
at Philadelphia, Giants have averaged 27.6 points. "All of a sudden,
they're on a little bit of a roll," Eagle defensive coordinator Jim

plenty to play for, namely to eliminate the chance of getting robbed
(snow) blind somewhere in the Northeast. LINE: Oakland by 7 1/2.</TE>

<HD>Chandler Is Out, so Burris Gets the Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concussion-plagued quarterback Chris Chandler will not start for the
Chicago Bears in Sunday's regular-season finale against Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old Chandler left during the second quarter of last
week's 24-14 loss to Carolina with the fifth concussion of his
career.</LD>
<LD>   Former CFL and Temple player Henry Burris, who replaced Chandler
last week, will make his first NFL start Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bear Coach Dick Jauron and offensive coordinator John
Stoop were optimistic that Chandler would play. But the quarterback
saw team doctors late Thursday, and they determined he hadn't shown
enough progress in his recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really changed," Jauron said Friday. "It was an ongoing
evaluation. They would see him every single day. A concussion, they
wanted to watch it closely.</TE>
<TE>   "When they evaluated him, they really just didn't feel like it was
in his best interest to play."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler did not practice Friday and wasn't available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers may have to make their final push at
securing a first-round bye in the playoffs without Darren Sharper.</TE>
<TE>   The all-pro free safety didn't practice Friday and remains
questionable because of a sprained ligament in his right knee for
Green Bay's regular-season finale Sunday against the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   Sharper hasn't practiced all week and did only some light
rehabilitation work on the knee Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He's expected to test the knee again today, and his status will be
a game-day decision. If Sharper does play Sunday, he will do so with
a knee brace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve McNair missed another practice because of tightness in his
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous four weeks, rib and toe injuries have caused
McNair to sit out virtually every workout but he has not missed a
game. Coach Jeff Fisher said that inability to prepare physically has
led to the current situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing structurally wrong. The ribs are feeling better,
and the toe is feeling better," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of doing things just once a week and not doing much
during the week other than stretching and then going on the field and
playing Sundays. When you do something once a week, you'll have a
tendency to get stiff and sore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Raiders gave Kansas City's defense a serious
confidence boost two months ago, and the Chiefs needed it badly. The
league's last-place defense held the NFL's top-rated offense to its
lowest point total of the year in a 20-10 win at Arrowhead Stadium on
Oct. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs believe there's no reason they can't do it again today
when they meet the Raiders at Oakland, but they realize it will be a
lot tougher with the rowdy Raider Nation going against them on every
down.</TE>
<TE>   This game also carries more importance for both teams. The Raiders
(10-5), who won the AFC West for the third straight time, could
secure home-field advantage through the playoffs, and the first-round
bye that accompanies it, with a victory. The Chiefs (8-7) still can
make the playoffs, which would end a four-year postseason drought.</TE>
<TE>   Raider quarterback Rich Gannon put up big numbers in that loss to
the Chiefs two months ago, completing 35 of 55 passes for 334 yards,
but he couldn't get his team into the end zone enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we got after them pretty good up front," said Chief
linebacker Mike Maslowski, who needs six tackles to break the
franchise single-season record of 157 set by Gary Spani in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The win was the first for the Chiefs over the Raiders in six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon hasn't lost any faith in Oakland's creative offensive
system, despite low numbers the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a system that's been very productive for us," he said.
"However, if you make mistakes or make mental errors and you're not
clean in your performance, then it's tough."</TE>

<HD>Rare Road Victory for the Thrashers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Don Waddell era is off to a good start in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Tapper redirected a shot from Andy Sutton early in the third
period Friday night at Raleigh, N.C., as the Thrashers beat the
Carolina Hurricanes, 5-3, in Waddell's first game as coach.</LD>
<LD>   Ilya Kovalchuk scored two goals for the Thrashers, who came in
with an NHL-worst 21 points and a 2-12-1-2 record in road games. But
they rallied from an early two-goal deficit and won for only the
second time in their last 11 games.</LD>
<TE>   "That always happens: You get a change and then you end up winning
a game," said left winger Dany Heatley, who scored his ninth goal of
the season in the first period. "Hopefully this will be a little
spark for us and we can go on a little bit of a tear."</TE>
<TE>   Waddell, the team's general manager, took over after firing Curt
Fraser on Thursday. Waddell hadn't coached since the 1991-92 season,
when he guided the San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey
League.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Florida 0 -- Ron Tugnutt made 23 saves at Sunrise, Fla.,
for the 22nd shutout of his career.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tugnutt's first shutout for Dallas. His last shutout was
March 2 against the Kings when he played for Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas ended a five-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Colorado 1 -- Eric Desjardins scored with 3:22
left in overtime at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   On the first shot by either team in overtime, Desjardins scored on
a backhander from the slot after taking a pass from Jeremy Roenick.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Montreal 2 -- Marian Hossa scored 50 seconds into
overtime, after Mike Fisher scored with 45.7 seconds left in
regulation for the Senators at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 5, Boston 2 -- Martin St. Louis and Fredrik Modin scored
two minutes apart midway through the third period at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay captain Dave Andreychuk moved past Jari Kurri into 13th
place on the all-time goal-scoring list when he scored his 602nd goal
in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, New Jersey 2 -- Jaromir Jagr and Peter Bondra scored
53 seconds apart in the second period to lead the Capitals at
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Olaf Kolzig made 29 saves and Steve Konowalchuk also scored for
the Capitals, who have won four games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Calgary 3 -- Jonas Hoglund scored the tying goal early
in the third period and added the winner with 3:26 left at Calgary,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Mats Sundin scored a first-period goal for the Maple Leafs but
left the game in the third period after being checked into the glass
by Flame defenseman Bob Boughner. Sundin's left shoulder hit the
stiff glass awkwardly and he did not return.</TE>

<HD>Odom's Got Next ... Finally</HD>
<DH>Clipper forward eager to play tonight in his first game in
11 months. Gentry stresses caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The thing about Lamar Odom is that everything he says, everything he
does, everything that happens to him seems so wildly out of
proportion. His talent on the basketball court and his troubles off
it appear so much greater than the next guy's.</LD>
<LD>   Odom stands 6 feet 10, difficult to miss even among other tall
men, and perhaps that's the first clue that something is out of
whack.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's not his fault.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it is.</TE>
<TE>   All that truly matters is that he's coming back tonight to play
the game he loves, the game he hasn't played for 11 agonizing months
because of serious wrist and ankle injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see a red carpet," Clipper teammate Quentin Richardson
said. "Tell them Q. Richardson wants to see a red carpet rolled out
for his boy Lamar Odom."</TE>
<TE>   Odom, seated in a folding metal chair after a recent practice at
Los Angeles Southwest College, listened to Richardson's over-the-top
plea and smiled faintly.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Odom hasn't thought much beyond leaving his seat on the
Clipper bench to face the Golden State Warriors tonight at Staples
Center. He simply can't wait to peel away his warmups, get on the
floor, feel the ball in his hands and hear the squeak of his sneakers
on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming off my suspension last year, I thought I would just play,"
Odom said, referring to the eight-game suspension he served for
violating the NBA's drug policy for the second time in eight months.
"My first two years in the league, I used to say to myself that I was
lucky I had never been hurt. That's all changed."</TE>
<TE>   Odom sprained his right wrist after a fall during the Clippers'
victory Dec. 16, 2001, over the Detroit Pistons. He continued to
play, but went on the injured list Jan. 24, hoping that rest would
allow his wrist to heal. He was set to return to the court when, on
Feb. 14, he stepped on a stray basketball while trying to dunk and
sprained his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Then, during an off-season workout, with his wrist healed and his
ankle improved, Odom re-injured his ankle. He had to wear a hard cast
for several weeks. Only now, after months of rehabilitative exercises
and several weeks of difficult practices with teammates, has he been
pronounced fit to play by the team's medical staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Easily," Odom said when asked if this had been the most difficult
period in his basketball life. "Having to sit out has been tough,
especially since we're expected to push for a playoff spot. It hurts.
This season, it hurts."</TE>
<TE>   Several days earlier he had said, "I'm just waiting my turn to get
out there. It seems like these last couple of weeks is taking
forever. I wanted to push it up. But I made a date and I'll stick by
it. It's a medical decision to wait until my body is ready to play.
It's not just for this year, but the years to come."</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly, at least, Odom has never stopped being the same person,
a super-sized man with a personality to match. There were times,
however, away from reporters and teammates, that the pain and
frustration poured out of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him since he was 15," said Jerry DeGregorio, Clipper
director of player development, a former coach at the University of
Rhode Island and godfather to Odom's children, Destiny and Lamar Jr.
"This probably has been the most difficult period of his life. At
Rhode Island, he was still able to play that year he had to sit out.
He wasn't injured. When he can't play, it's very devastating to him.
I've encouraged him to persevere. I've told him, 'He who endures
conquers.'</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there have been moments when he's been very frustrated.
There were moments that I was concerned about his spirits. He's been
through a lot in his life, which I think made the process a littler
easier. He's only 23, but he became an adult early in his life. He
became an adult when he was still a teenager. I think that helped him
handle the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Odom's past has been well chronicled. He attended several New
York-area high schools before landing at highly regarded Christ the
King. He never played for his original college, Nevada Las Vegas,
which still is on NCAA probation for improprieties in recruiting him.
After transferring, he sat out a season at Rhode Island when his
college entrance scores were questioned. He then opted for the NBA
draft, after averaging 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists in
1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers selected him fourth overall, making him the
centerpiece of one of the league's rising and most exciting teams.
Two drug suspensions and an almost yearlong layoff have set him and
the team back significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for greatness remains, although no one is expecting
Odom to carry the Clippers for at least the next few months. It's
going to take time, something Coach Alvin Gentry has reminded anyone
who has asked about Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anybody to think he's the cavalry and he's riding in
on a white horse to save us," Gentry said. "The kid will have gone
through [almost] a whole year where he hasn't played and people are
going to have to be patient with him. We're not going to play him
35-40 minutes when he gets back. I don't expect him, after a year of
not playing basketball, to have all his timing. He'll come off the
bench at the start."</TE>
<TE>   At that precise moment, Odom walked past Gentry's Staples Center
office on his way to the court to begin a pregame workout. Odom
peered in, screwed up his face in mock surprise and mouthed, "Are you
talking about me coming off the bench?"</TE>
<TE>   Gentry broke out in a hearty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really going to help us," Gentry said, "but I don't want him
to feel all this pressure. Obviously, we went to him almost every
time down the floor our first year here [in 2000-01]. The guys we
have now are getting better. We don't have to depend on him to carry
our team as in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers don't expect Odom to average 17.2 points, 7.8
rebounds and 5.2 assists, as he did in 2000-01, but they hope his
versatile play will lead them where they want to go: the playoffs,
for the first time since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   A good return could mean a great deal to the team, but also to
Odom, who will be a restricted free agent next summer. Once again,
expectations have been put on hold while Odom gets his game back.</TE>
<TE>   "If Lamar goes out and plays and does his stuff, if he goes out
and plays well, the other stuff will take care of itself," said agent
Jeff Schwartz when asked about Odom's prospects for a fat new
contract. "I think we have to wait and see what happens on the
court."</TE>
<TE>   Limited to averages of 13.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists
in 29 games last season because of the injuries and the drug
suspension, Odom must resist the temptation to do too much too soon.
The Clippers can't wait to get him on the floor, but they also know
he can't solve all their troubles in one game or one week.</TE>
<TE>   "We miss his versatility, his tenacious defense, the way he hits
the lanes [on fastbreaks]," said forward Elton Brand, a childhood
friend from New York. "He's going to help everybody's game. I haven't
played with him in a long time. But we're ready to get him back.
We're going to help him. We're going to work him through it."</TE>

<PH>ROSE BOWL * WASHINGTON STATE vs. OKLAHOMA</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Sooners Wary of Deep Trouble</HD>
<DH>Burned by long pass plays in both its losses, Oklahoma
expects to have its secondary tested in the Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When defensive linemen and linebackers have an off day, it rarely
makes the highlight films. Cornerbacks aren't as fortunate.</LD>
<LD>   "With cornerbacks," Andre Woolfolk said, "we're the last ones that
people see chasing the guy into the end zone."</LD>
<LD>   Woolfolk and his teammates in the Oklahoma secondary suffered that
indignity twice this season, when Texas A&amp;M and Oklahoma State
connected on long touchdown passes and handed the Sooners their only
two defeats.</LD>
<TE>   The big plays were featured on sportscasts across the nation and
jolted a team that had regained prominence on the strength of a
grudging defense.</TE>
<TE>   With No. 8 Oklahoma facing No. 7 Washington State in the Rose Bowl
on New Year's Day, the matchups raise suspicions that the Sooners
will be vulnerable to Cougar quarterback Jason Gesser and his
talented receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they'll test us deep," said Mike Stoops, co-defensive
coordinator and secondary coach. "We have to be smart and know
they're going to attack what they think is our weakness."</TE>
<TE>   Stoops and his older brother, Bob, the head coach, get credit for
reviving the Sooner defense after their arrival in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Before going to Norman, Bob was the defensive coordinator at
Florida. Mike held the same position at Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   They began by installing a scheme that relies on zone coverage and
blitzing from all angles. A dozen Oklahoma players recorded multiple
sacks this season, among them nickel back Brandon Shelby, who had
four despite not starting a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has an important role," defensive end Jimmy Wilkerson
said. "That's what makes this defense fun."</TE>
<TE>   But the transformation wasn't simply Xs and O's, said Woolfolk,
who was around for the coaching change as a freshman. Stoops, he
said, "came in with confidence and swagger."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Sooners were shutting down opponents. They won the
national championship by suffocating Florida State in the 2001 Orange
Bowl, 13-2, and followed that with a 10-3 victory over Arkansas in
the Cotton Bowl last season.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, safety Roy Williams and linebacker Rocky Calmus
became stars and eventually landed in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   This season, tackle Tommie Harris and linebacker Teddy Lehman have
taken their places as All-Americans. The Sooners rank sixth in the
nation in scoring defense, surrendering 15.5 points a game, and set a
team record for interception return yards.</TE>
<TE>   "They swarm," Gesser said. "They have a lot of speed and
aggressiveness. They're phenomenal, really."</TE>
<TE>   All of which made the breakdowns against Texas A&amp;M and Oklahoma
State surprising.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies defeated Oklahoma, 30-26, by completing four touchdown
pass plays, three of them going for 40 yards or more. The Cowboys
also had four touchdown pass plays, two of them going for 41 and 60
yards, on the way to a 38-28 victory.</TE>
<TE>   This was a Sooner defense that had shut out Tulsa and bounced back
to hold Colorado to seven points in the Big 12 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Some players said they benefited from watching films of the losses
because they learned from their mistakes. Lehman found it hard to
take. "It was embarrassing," the linebacker said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners would like to believe they simply grew overconfident.</TE>
<TE>   The defensive backs were jumping on short routes too quickly,
susceptible to pump fakes and out-and-up routes.</TE>
<TE>   "You get to the point where you don't want any balls caught on
your side of the field," Woolfolk said. "You want to make every
play."</TE>
<TE>   The senior smiles a little sheepishly at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make every play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes a matchup with Washington State and the talented Gesser,
who threw for 3,169 yards this season and proved that he and his
receivers can go deep.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Riley averages almost 17 yards a reception and had
touchdown catches of 30 or more yards against Nevada, Cal and Arizona
State. Devard Darling burned Idaho and Oregon for scores of 40 or
more yards.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser sees the possibility of similar success in the Rose Bowl.
"If we control their front seven, they'll be vulnerable in the
secondary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And if Oklahoma becomes preoccupied with stopping the pass, the
Cougars have a running threat in Jermaine Green, who averaged 5.5
yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got talent," Woolfolk said. "This is going to be our
biggest challenge."</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Stoops swears his defense will stick to its premise of
playing zone most of the time, albeit an aggressive zone that allows
the secondary to blitz and take chances.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the system," he said. "Find the fastest guys and utilize
their speed by moving them around."</TE>
<TE>   Controlling the Cougars also will depend on playing a little
smarter and pressuring Gesser, who suffered a leg injury late in the
season and might not be fully recovered.</TE>
<TE>   A strong rush would be welcomed by Woolfolk. The 6-foot-1
speedster is known for his ability to close on the ball and could be
a first-round NFL draft pick come April.</TE>
<TE>   But, given his experiences this season, he'd just as soon not make
any highlight shows on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is play good," he said, "and you won't get
talked about."</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Stirs Long Memory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Returning to Pasadena elicits vivid memories from Oklahoma offensive
coordinator Chuck Long, who played in the Rose Bowl twice as a
quarterback for Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Long was the starter when the Hawkeyes faced UCLA in the 1986 Rose
Bowl, but his favorite story dates to the 1982 game against
Washington when he was a young reserve.</LD>
<LD>   With Iowa behind, 28-0, late in the fourth quarter, then-coach
Hayden Fry turned to the bench and asked the freshman if he wanted to
enter the game and get on national television.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course, by that time the credits were rolling down the TV
screen," Long said. "But my family could see me through the credits."</TE>
<TE>   He recalled being on the field long enough to take two snaps.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what I was doing," he said. "I tucked the ball
under my arm and ran it both times."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second day, the Sooners practiced at Loyola Marymount and
this time they had Tommie Harris, an All-American defensive tackle,
on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Harris arrived a day late after confusion over his airline ticket
caused him to miss a Christmas Day flight from Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was going to get here somehow," he said. "But it
aggravated me not being here to practice with my teammates."</TE>
<TE>   The sophomore was not nearly as upset about missing his team's
visit to "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really a big fan of TV," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Harris worked into the mix, receivers Antwone Savage and
Brandon Jones sat out of practice. Savage injured his ankle on
Thursday, and Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said the receiver also has
flu. Jones has a sore knee.</TE>
<TE>   Both players were expected to recover before the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How excited were Sooner fans when their team received a bid to the
Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   On the first Monday after the invitation was announced, the
university sold 13,000 tickets to the game, the largest single day of
bowl ticket sales in Oklahoma history.</TE>
<TE>   "To put that in context, this is our 36th bowl," team spokesman
Kenny Mossman said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Oklahoma sold 27,500 tickets and had to turn fans away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners will visit Lawry's restaurant for the "Beef Bowl"
after practice this afternoon, but strength coach Jerry Schmidt does
not expect any of his starters to overindulge.</TE>
<TE>   The team attended a similar function before the Cotton Bowl last
season and the veterans know the benefit of moderation.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some of your freshman and redshirt players will go wild,"
Schmidt said. "But [quarterback] Nate Hybl isn't going to set any
Beef Bowl records."</TE>

<HD>Williams, Ross Feel at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>USC receiver Mike Williams and safety Mike Ross, both freshmen from
Florida, are happy to be back in their home state for the Orange
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "It's almost like a storybook," Ross said Friday after the
Trojans' went through their first practice, a one-hour workout in
shorts.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Orgeron, USC's defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator,
is even more pleased. Williams' emergence as one of the top receivers
in the nation has opened the door for the Trojans in the Sunshine
State.</LD>
<TE>   "We're getting more interest from kids down here," said Orgeron,
who coached at Miami from 1988 to '92.</TE>
<TE>   Ross envisions a day when the USC roster will be stocked with
players from California and many others from Florida and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "As we continue to win and as we continue to get more Florida
players on the team, it's going to be a place everyone is going to
want to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said the short practice helped coaches
smooth organizational kinks.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, for example, are using a portion of a gym at Nova
University as their locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances we did well," Carroll said. "We succeeded
in getting this one out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   The real work begins today, when the Trojans will be in full pads
for a regular game-week workout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be able to gauge much more where we are after that," Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had dinner in South Beach and then were allowed to
tour the area nightlife on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, local law enforcement officers briefed players
about the Miami area.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just letting us know about everything we need to stay
away from," cornerback Marcell Allmond said. "It's good stuff to know
and I think everyone was paying attention."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are scheduled to take a chartered fishing trip after
today's morning practice.</TE>

<HD>Australian Bosnich Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Barrero</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich on Friday was charged with
breaching the doping regulations of England's Football Assn. and
bringing the game into disrepute after testing positive for cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   The association said that the Chelsea goalkeeper, who also has
played for Manchester United and Aston Villa of the English Premier
League, has been suspended from all soccer-related activities until
the two charges are heard. No date for the hearing has been set.</LD>
<LD>   "The FA would not normally make any public statements at this
stage of a case of this type, however, in view of numerous media
reports over the past few weeks the situation required
clarification," the governing body said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Bosnich, 30, who has not played for Chelsea since November 2001
and has made only seven appearances, was diagnosed with severe
depression last month and admitted to a clinic for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Carillo to Cruz Azul</TE>
<TE>   Mario Carillo, who had a 10-match unbeaten streak as interim coach
of Club America while Manuel Lapuente took a medical leave, has been
named coach for Cruz Azul in the Mexican league.</TE>
<TE>   Carillo replaces Jose Luis Trejo, who was fired after Cruz Azul
was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Apertura championship.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano Moves</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Chilean striker Ivan "Bam Bam" Zamorano has signed a
six-month contract with Colo Colo, Chile's reigning champion and most
popular team.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano, 35, who has played in Europe for Real Madrid and Inter
Milan and more recently played for America in Mexico, will not be
paid directly by Colo Colo.</TE>
<TE>   His salary will be determined by the number of sponsors his
presence attracts.</TE>
<TE>   Zamorano's first game is Jan. 25 against Independiente of
Argentina in the Copa Libertadores.</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia Bids for 2010</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia has submitted an official bid to play host to the 2010
World Cup, said Hammouda Ben Ammar, head of the Tunisian Soccer
Federation.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa and Morocco already have submitted bids for the
tournament that FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter has said will be
staged in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Ammar said there is a chance Tunisia could ask to co-host the
event with Morocco.</TE>
<TE>   In a controversial vote of 12-11 in July 2000, South Africa lost
out to Germany for the right to play host to World Cup 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Peru</TE>
<TE>   Because FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has decided to rotate
the World Cup among its six confederations, South America figures to
be next in line after Africa.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, a spokesman for the Peruvian Football
Federation, already has announced plans for Peru and four other
Andean countries to propose a joint bid for the 2014 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a project for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela to co-host the tournament," Wilmer del Aguila told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   South American teams have won nine of the 17 World Cup titles, but
the continent has not had the tournament since 1978, when Argentina
played host.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia won the right to stage the 1986 tournament but had to bow
out for economic reasons, leaving the tournament to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Denilson Suspended</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian standout Denilson received a four-match suspension from
the Spanish Football Federation for his conduct while playing for
first-division Real Betis.</TE>
<TE>   Denilson was red carded last week for kicking Osasuna defender
Jose Izquierdo. The suspension was increased from one to four games
because Denilson insulted the referee and returned to the field to
celebrate his team's winning goal.</TE>

<LD>New UCLA Coach Karl Dorrell has asked Idaho Coach Tom Cable to come
to Westwood as offensive coordinator and line coach.</LD>
<LD>   Cable, who is 8-26 in three seasons with the Vandals, told the
Idaho Statesman that Dorrell made the offer Dec. 18, the day he was
hired to replace Bob Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   "If it's going to happen, it's just a matter of me saying I'm in,"
Cable said. "As of right now, I'm still at Idaho."</LD>
<TE>   Idaho has won only three games the last two seasons and Cable was
under fire from boosters in November. He makes $197,000 a year and
probably would take a pay cut to become Bruin offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Cable was offensive line coach at Colorado in 1998 when Dorrell
was the offensive coordinator there.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell interviewed seven current UCLA assistants Friday and said
their knowledge and loyalty impressed him. He said that he has
received letters from Bruin players and parents asking that he retain
current assistants.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA and Michigan will be on a scavenger hunt today to locate a shred
of dignity, a measure of pride and an ounce of their former splendor.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (2-4) are playing for the third time on national
television. The first two ended in one-sided losses to Duke and
Kansas. Worse were games mercifully shown only on regional cable,
upsets at the hands of San Diego and Northern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   The Wolverines (4-6) beat Eastern Michigan on Monday, sparing
themselves the embarrassment of being swept by three mid-major,
instate schools. Michigan lost to Western Michigan and to Central
Michigan during a season-opening, six-game losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   Vestiges of the proud traditions of these onetime powers remain.
At least UCLA has an edge there.</TE>
<TE>   Legendary former UCLA coach John Wooden should be sitting in his
customary seat near the Bruin bench. His image remains one of
wholesomeness and unquestioned integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Not so with Michigan. Serious transgressions involving Chris
Webber and other key members of powerful Michigan teams from the
1990s prompted the school to take down Final Four banners from 1992
and 1993 and forfeit victories. The self-imposed penalties, Wolverine
officials hope, will be enough to deter the NCAA from imposing
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was indicted on charges he lied to Michigan investigators
and a federal grand jury about $280,000 he allegedly received from
booster Ed Martin during Webber's Fab Five and high school careers.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty could cloud the entire season. Michigan officials
will meet with the NCAA infractions committee Feb. 14, but a verdict
is not expected until several weeks after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Wolverines try to focus on climbing out of the
sizable hole created by the 0-6 start. Michigan trailed by seven
points midway through the first half against Eastern Michigan before
rallying to an 85-57 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We played with a lot of hunger and intensity," Coach Tommy Amaker
said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward LaVell Blanchard became the sixth Michigan player
to amass 1,500 points and 700 rebounds. Junior guard Bernard Robinson
Jr. has played well in the four victories and freshman guard Daniel
Horton is beginning to contribute after early struggles, scoring 24
points in one half against Bowling Green.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA needs to improve its interior defense and find some semblance
of offensive rhythm. A symptom that the Bruins are taking too many
perimeter shots is their lack of free throws. They went to the line
only six times against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get better shots on offense and develop some balance
in our attack," Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get to the bonus sooner and take more inside
high-percentage shots so we aren't taking contested shots from the
perimeter."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Although UCLA is coming off a dispiriting, one-sided
loss at Kansas, home woes are of greater concern. Including
exhibitions, the Bruins are 2-4 at Pauley Pavilion. Forwards Andre
Patterson and Dijon Thompson were the only Bruins to play well
against Kansas, but Thompson's availability is in doubt because of a
swollen knee. He did not practice Thursday and went through light
drills Friday. Duke is the only common opponent of Michigan and UCLA,
beating each handily.</TE>

<PH>ROSE BOWL * WASHINGTON STATE vs. OKLAHOMA</PH>
<KH>WASHINGTON STATE REPORT</KH>
<HD>Cougars Can Always Turn to Dunning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Rose Bowl comes down to a pressure kick, Washington State's
Drew Dunning knows the territory.</LD>
<LD>   "It develops a confidence level when you've had game-winning and
game-tying kicks," Dunning said. "I go up there real confident, not
worrying about missing, the crowd, or people calling my name."</LD>
<LD>   The biggest kick of his career came against USC this season.</LD>
<TE>   Not the 35-yard game-winner in overtime, but the other 35-yarder
he made to tie the score in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "With 1:50 left, we're down three," he said. "If you don't make
it, they run out the clock and the game's over."</TE>
<TE>   He made it, helping force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   On the first possession of overtime, USC's Ryan Killeen -- who had
missed a crucial extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter -- tried
to make up for it on a 52-yard field-goal attempt. He missed.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State took over, and set up Dunning for a 35-yard
attempt -- not so much pressure, really, because if he missed, the
game would continue.</TE>
<TE>   He nailed it, and that 30-27 victory is why Washington State --
not USC -- is in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Dunning, a junior, has been on the losing end of overtime too --
in the Cougars' 29-26 triple-overtime loss to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He made four field goals in that game, including two in overtime
and one with 4:41 left in regulation. But he didn't get a chance in
the final overtime after a controversial play was ruled a fumble
recovered by Washington, ending the game.</TE>
<TE>   "In overtime, it's like penalty kicks, that's the best way to
describe it," Dunning said. "I'd like to have scored or had a chance
to answer his kick in overtime."</TE>
<TE>   Dunning, a former walk-on, doesn't have the strongest leg -- the
longest kick of his career is 49 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma freshman Trey DiCarlo made 14 of 19 field goals this
season, but he is a stranger to overtime and didn't play many close
games.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of good kickers, college and pro, miss game-winning or
game-tying kicks when they know they can do it," Dunning said. "But
really, there's nothing different from any other kicks.</TE>
<TE>   "Against USC, that game-winning field goal was no different from
any other. A 35-yard field goal shouldn't be any different in August
than it is Jan. 1."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After practicing Friday, the Oklahoma and Washington State players
made an appearance at Disney's California Adventure and also sampled
some rides.</TE>
<TE>   For the Washington State players with Southern California ties, it
was a bit of nostalgia from childhood trips to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "The teacups, the swings, that's me," said receiver Mike Bush,
from Riverside. "Something slow, where I can't fall out."</TE>
<TE>   Not defensive tackle Rien Long, who was born in Los Angeles but
went to high school in Anacortes, Wash. He's strictly a
roller-coaster man.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more of a Magic Mountain guy," he said of the Six Flags park
in Valencia.</TE>

<HD>Biggest Game Lakers Are Losing Is the Mental One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget about Kobe Bryant's relationship with the triangle offense.
Forget about Shaquille O'Neal's lack of explosiveness. Forget about
poor-shooting role players.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' biggest problem is mental.</LD>
<LD>   How else can you explain their lack of urgency when the game was
on the line in their Christmas Day loss to the Sacramento Kings?</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers certainly didn't help themselves with a third-quarter
collapse, during which the Kings turned a 65-53 deficit into a 77-71
lead, but Los Angeles still had a chance in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then, over the final six minutes, the Lakers simply did not get
the job done. It was a complete team effort, which is why the Lakers
find themselves in the mud, instead of their normal position at the
top of the NBA food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson has played and coached teams that failed to
successfully defend NBA titles and he understands as well as anyone
that championship runs have to end some time.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lakers can kiss their "four-peat" good-bye if they
continue to make plays as they did in crunch time against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a list of their fourth-quarter breakdowns:</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 -- Poor communication between Brian Shaw and Rick Fox on a
backdoor cut and layup by Jimmy Jackson that gave the Kings a 90-83
lead with 5:51 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento point guard Mike Bibby passed the ball into the right
post to forward Chris Webber, who was being guarded by Samaki Walker.
After Bibby made his pass, he cut toward Jackson, who stood near the
top of the key. But instead of setting a pick for Jackson, Bibby
faked and gave the veteran Sacramento swingman enough space to cut to
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   That's when communication between two veterans, Shaw and Fox,
broke down for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who was on Bibby, initially switched to cover Jackson but he
got caught looking at Fox, who faded back from Bibby. This moment of
indecision cost the Lakers because by the time Shaw had pushed Fox
forward, Webber had completed an easy pass to Jackson, who scored an
uncontested basket.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 -- Weak effort getting back on defense by Walker and Bryant
on a fastbreak basket by Jackson that gave the Kings a 95-89 lead
with 2:53 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had a chance to cut Sacramento's lead to two points but
Bryant dribbled for 17 seconds against the Kings' match-up zone. When
he finally turned the ball over, Peja Stojakovic picked it up near
the Lakers' free-throw line and started a fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   While Stojakovic, Jackson and Bibby ran downcourt, only Derek
Fisher and Fox made serious efforts to get back to the defensive end.
Walker ran, but not hard enough to prevent Jackson from scoring even
though he had a chance to possibly stop the Kings' break.</TE>
<TE>   And Bryant? He never got past half court because after he'd turned
the ball over, he stood around sulking, apparently thinking he had
been fouled on the play.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 -- Failure to battle for a key offensive rebound with the
Kings ahead, 95-89, with 2:24 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had three chances to make a basket but failed. Fisher
had two good looks on perimeter jump shots but missed both times. Fox
hustled to get the first rebound and O'Neal pulled down the second,
but after O'Neal clanged his shot from the lane, the Lakers were
caught flat-footed.</TE>
<TE>   By the time O'Neal missed, Sacramento had the basket surrounded
with Webber and Vlade Divac. Because Walker got boxed out, he had to
jump around Divac and ended up banging into Fisher and knocking the
ball out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   But Walker was not the only Laker at fault. Either Bryant or Fox,
or both, should have been fighting for the rebound instead of staying
on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 -- Inability to shut down a Sacramento half-court play that
ended with Divac's two-hand dunk, which put the Kings ahead, 99-91,
with 1:38 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Kings' favorite plays starts with getting the ball into
the right post to Webber. From a spread offensive set, which featured
Divac above the key, the Kings ran a series of cuts off the ball,
with Bibby and Jackson emerging together at the free-throw line. This
is where they lost the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Fox was caught on a screen by Bibby and by the time Fisher
reacted, Jackson had the ball on the right wing with a clear path to
the lane. Robert Horry, who had replaced Walker and was guarding
Webber, switched outside to Jackson, leaving Fox to front the bigger
Sacramento forward.</TE>
<TE>   With a smaller man on him, Webber made a strong cut to the basket
after giving the ball to Jackson, which attracted O'Neal to the right
side of the lane. That left Divac open and he gathered in a pass from
Jackson for a two-hand slam.</TE>

<LD>A $100-million power plant for the tiny industrial city of Vernon has
been recommended for state approval, a spokesman for the California
Energy Commission said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Commission staffers recommended granting a license for the
134-megawatt, natural gas-fired plant, spokesman Chris Davis said.</LD>
<LD>   Vernon officials want the plant to produce electricity for sale to
industrial customers in Southern California. It would be built
alongside an Art Deco building housing five diesel generators that
have produced electricity since 1933.</LD>

<LD>Two adults and three children escaped unharmed from a blaze that
destroyed their house, a fire official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The fire in the 19900 block of Strathern Street started in the
garage about 11:30 p.m. Thursday. The occupants tried unsuccessfully
to douse the flames, fleeing to safety when they realized it was out
of control, said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. The cause
of the fire was being investigated but officials did not believe the
blaze had been deliberately set, Humphrey said.</LD>

<LD>Two Simi Valley police detectives have received a national award for
their work with federal agents on a two-year investigation that led
to the bust of one of the largest drug rings that made and sold an
animal tranquilizer popular on the rave scene.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Lamb and Kevin Duncan were among several law enforcement
agents honored this month at a Washington ceremony for their role in
the cross-border investigation that netted massive amounts of the
drug Ketamine, also known on the streets as Special K, vitamin K and
Kit Kat.</LD>
<LD>   The two detectives, who have a combined 31 years with the Simi
Valley Police Department, received the award for investigative
excellence from the Drug Enforcement Administration. They also
received a special commendation last week from the Simi Valley City
Council.</LD>
<TE>   Their involvement in the case, which took them to several states
and Mexico in pursuit of the ringleaders, began more than two years
ago on a tip that someone was selling steroids and Ketamine from a
Simi Valley gym, Lamb said.</TE>
<TE>   "Things just branched off from there," said Duncan, 44, the senior
investigator in the narcotics unit.</TE>
<TE>   When the detectives realized the scope of the ring -- which
involved the manufacturing of the pills in Mexico and their
distribution throughout the United States -- federal agents and San
Diego investigators also got involved.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't work these kinds of cases by yourself," said Lamb, 40.</TE>
<TE>   But Lamb and Duncan remained involved, traveling to Ohio, Florida
and Mexico to chase leads they received from a local dealer who
became an informant. They were on the scene in October for a
cross-border raid in San Diego that netted $2 million in cash and
assets and more than 600,000 vials of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those moments of excitement," Duncan said. "But
certainly a lot of it was not exciting. Every case has its ups and
downs. A lot of the time you're looking at reports and recording what
you've done in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The irony that two officers working in one of the nation's safest
cities received a national crime-fighting award is not lost on the
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be one of the safest cities in the country, but that
doesn't mean we don't have the same problems as those in big cities,"
said Duncan, noting Simi Valley's proximity to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Both men, who are married and have children, said that in addition
to having two of the best jobs in the 120-officer Simi Valley Police
Department, they feel they are helping fight one of society's most
relentless scourges -- illegal drug use.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to stop it," Duncan said. "But I'd just like to not
have to worry so much about my children being involved in it , or
their children, for that matter."</TE>

<HD>Police Pursuit of Suspects in Shooting Closes Freeway</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police who heard gunshots in Venice on Thursday chased the suspected
shooters, at one point exchanging gunfire with one of them, and
ultimately shut down the Marina Freeway during a search that involved
70 police units and five dogs.</LD>
<LD>   At one point during the chase, one suspect fled across the San
Diego Freeway, causing a six-car pileup. No one was seriously
injured.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 11:30 p.m., when officers heard shots
fired near 7th and Brooks avenues. Police chased three men who had
allegedly shot and wounded a 45-year-old man, LAPD spokesman Jason Li
said. About a mile into that chase, the suspects pulled over, and
police ordered them from the car. The front-seat passenger, believed
to be Gustavo Perez, 21, got out, turned and fired a shotgun twice at
officers, Li said. Officers returned fire, but no one was hit, he
said. The suspects sped off again, now going east on the Marina
Freeway. They stopped quickly to let Perez out.</LD>
<TE>   While some officers chased him, others resumed the chase onto the
northbound San Diego Freeway. The suspects exited at Culver
Boulevard, driving briefly through residential streets until they
tried to make a left turn and crashed into a chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   One of the two men ran across the nearby San Diego Freeway,
causing the six-car pileup. He was wrestled to the ground, Li said.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than three hours before police had all of the
suspects in custody. The other men were identified as Marcos de la
Trinidad, 21, and Juan Leon, 19. The entire Marina Freeway was shut
down until about 1 a.m. Friday, as were the ramps to the San Diego
Freeway from Slauson Avenue to Washington Boulevard.</TE>

<HD>Condor Treated at Zoo Released Into the Wild</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A condor recently released after treatment for lead poisoning was
winging her way north Friday toward her old foraging ground, a
spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said.</LD>
<LD>   The huge endangered bird, known as AC8, is at least 30 years old,
which makes her one of the last known condors to be raised in the
wild, said Greg Austin, a scientist with the service's condor
recovery project. Lead levels in her blood were found to be extremely
high during routine testing about six weeks ago, he said.</LD>
<LD>   AC8 was treated at the Los Angeles Zoo before her release into Los
Padres National Forest on Monday, Austin said.</LD>
<TE>   By week's end, radio transmitters affixed to her showed that she
was heading toward her favorite feeding area in the southern Sierra
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Lead chunks were discovered in her digestive tract, Austin said.
More tests must be done to pinpoint where they came from.</TE>

<HD>Applicants Outpace University Budget</HD>
<DH>The new Cal State Channel Islands has funds for 250
freshmen but has received 2,200 forms as a state financial crunch
looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the four-day Thanksgiving break, the admissions office at Cal
State Channel Islands was flooded with more than 1,000 freshmen
applications.</LD>
<LD>   A week later, Gov. Gray Davis proposed state budget reductions
that could mean drastic program cuts for the new campus near
Camarillo, which opens its doors to freshmen for the first time next
fall.</LD>
<LD>   These conflicting mandates -- to meet enrollment demand while
shrinking its budget -- present a major challenge for a young
university that has no student union, residence halls or sports
teams.</LD>
<TE>   "It's called a double whammy," university President Richard Rush
said. "It's certainly better to be popular than to be unpopular. But
in this climate, we're not going to get money to serve more students
than we planned for."</TE>
<TE>   For the fall term, the university's budget allows for about 250
freshmen, said W.M. Gregory Sawyer, vice president of student
affairs. He received 2,200 applications in the one-month application
period that closed Dec. 16. The volume of freshmen applications
surprised him, Sawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time we hadn't even been open a semester," Sawyer said.
"That's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the dilemma won't be known until at least February,
Sawyer said, when he learns how many of the 2,200 students qualify
for Cal State Channel Islands and how many are planning to attend.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Rush should also know how much money he will have to cut
from the university's budget. He said he has asked Cal State
officials to go easy on his campus as they ponder how to slash $60
million in spending to help close a projected $30-billion state
budget deficit while in the middle of an academic year.</TE>
<TE>   "As a brand new campus, we don't have any wiggle room in the
budget," Rush said. "I've asked ... if we could get a life raft on
this one."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, CSU officials agreed to hike student fees by
10% -- about $72 a semester -- to help cover shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's happy about this," Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Rush said, he had to trim $400,000 from the school's
small budget, and it wasn't easy. It will be even more difficult in
the next round, he said, because most departments on the start-up
campus are staffed by only one person. In many cases, to cut
personnel is to cut an entire service for students, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A mature institution has some flexibility we don't have yet,"
Rush said. "Certainly if we are cut significantly, we're going to
have to stop doing an awful lot of things we do."</TE>
<TE>   As Ventura County's first public four-year university, Rush said,
the new campus is committed to serving local students. He and Sawyer
said the lack of on-campus housing will deter students from faraway
areas.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't stop them from applying, however. Of the 2,200
freshmen applicants, about 1,700 are from outside commuting range --
mainly Northern California and San Diego, Sawyer said. About 500
students are from Ventura County and surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   State schools must accept all students who meet the minimum
entrance requirements, Sawyer said, regardless of whether there is
space for them. The average "yield rate" -- the number of students
who apply versus the number who show up on the first day of classes
-- averages about 25% at other Cal State campuses.</TE>
<TE>   That means the new university could potentially end up with 550
students, or double the number it has the money to serve next August,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   What then?</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding is we serve them," Sawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   An "enrollment management team" made up of professors, university
staff members and administrators must deal with the issue, Sawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   They will start by calling students who have been accepted to find
out if they intend to enroll. After that, they will start crunching
numbers. "For all of us, this is a really unique challenge," Sawyer
said. "We have to figure out how we're going to continue providing
quality instruction in a budget-crunch year."</TE>

<HD>Woman Dies in Lancaster Blaze; Neighbor Saves 3 Others in
House</HD>
<DH>A Marine who was loading his truck hears screams and is
able to rescue victim's husband and daughters from burning structure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 46-year-old Lancaster woman died in a house fire early Friday, but
her husband and two daughters escaped with minor injuries after they
were rescued by a Marine Corps corporal who lives nearby and heard
their screams, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Cpl. Arlen Traster was loading his pickup truck at 3 a.m., getting
ready to report for duty at Camp Pendleton, when, he said, "I heard a
girl cry out for help." Traster, 26, said he saw smoke coming from
the rear of a neighbor's house in the 500 block of Kettering Street,
three doors away.</LD>
<LD>   As he ran toward the house, Traster said he saw Jeanette Zepeda,
14, on the roof of the garage and shaking. "I asked her to jump down
to me," he said. "She ... basically slid down into my arms."</LD>
<TE>   The teenager told Traster her parents and sister were still inside
the burning house. Traster gave the girl his cell phone and told her
to call 911, then attempted to enter the house.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the house, Jesus Zepeda had grabbed his wife, Luz, and
younger daughter, Evelyn, and attempted to reach the stairs. The
smoke was too thick, though, and he could not find the steps.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he opened the bathroom door and there was no smoke in
there, so he put Luz and Evelyn inside," said Anthony Loya, Luz
Zepeda's brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, Traster, a machine-gunner, said he "went to the front
door, felt for heat and kicked it open." Traster said he called out
but heard no answer. Through the smoke, however, he spotted the
staircase.</TE>
<TE>   "I went up the stairs and yelled out again, but no one answered,"
said Traster, who began choking on the smoke and went back
downstairs.</TE>
<TE>   After gulping fresh air, Traster said, he made his way back to the
second floor. This time he heard a man's voice. Traster said he urged
the man to "follow my voice down the stairs."</TE>
<TE>   "He said his wife was still up there," Traster said. "I was
becoming overwhelmed by the smoke and started down the stairs. He
followed me. He was delirious."</TE>
<TE>   Once outside, Traster noticed Zepeda's other daughter in an
upstairs bathroom window.</TE>
<TE>   "She was holding on to something, I think it may have been her
mother's arm," said Traster, who urged the girl to step out on the
roof. "But she wouldn't come out."</TE>
<TE>   Traster ran to his home, retrieved a ladder, dashed back and met
the girl on the roof and brought her to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Traster said he tried once more to enter the home, but it was too
hot.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Los Angeles County firefighters had arrived. It took fire
crews 30 minutes to knock down the flames, authorities said. Inside,
firefighters found Luz Zepeda, 46, dead in an upstairs bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but county
Fire Inspector Kurt Schaefer said it may have started in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Zepeda, who was treated and released from Antelope Valley
Hospital, returned to his home in the afternoon. Having injured his
leg when he fell off a ladder in a desperate, last-ditch effort to
save his wife, he paced wobbly on crutches in front of the
fire-gutted structure. Friends and neighbors tried to console him.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Zepeda and friends entered the house and returned
with a family portrait. Zepeda's eyes filled with tears.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a wonderful mother and a very hard worker," said Loya,
adding that the family had just returned from Mexico for the funeral
of Luz Zepeda's grandmother. Luz Zepeda was born in Mexico, grew up
in the San Fernando Valley and moved to Lancaster a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Traster, who joined the Marines in 1996, has been on active
reserve duty at Camp Pendleton since February. Traster is part of the
Marine regiment assigned to homeland security in the San Diego area,
according to Marine Capt. Alison Salerno.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials credited Traster with saving three lives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very much a hero," said Schaefer. "He basically got three
people out of the house to a safe area."</TE>
<TE>   But Traster downplayed any attention directed toward him. "A woman
died this morning and everyone wants to congratulate me," he said.
"Everyone was in shock and crying. Their home and their mother are
gone."</TE>

<HD>The Parade Fixture You Never See</HD>
<DH>Driver Jim Femino will be piloting his 50th float in the
Rose Parade. It's a mark that ought to stand for a while.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Femino has spent 49 New Year's mornings on Colorado Boulevard in
Pasadena. And yet, he's never seen the Rose Parade with his own eyes.</LD>
<LD>   He isn't blind. On Wednesday, Femino will once again crawl through
a tiny, flower-decorated door and take his seat only eight inches off
the pavement. After a brief nap, he will try to navigate -- from the
darkness deep inside the city of Torrance's float -- a history-making
trip down the 5 1/2-mile parade route.</LD>
<LD>   This is Femino's 50th parade as a float driver, by all accounts a
record that may be tough to beat.</LD>
<TE>   "The other drivers all want to catch me," says Femino, 69,
unshaven and smoking a cigarette with a hand misshapen from years of
shoeing horses. "I don't think they will."</TE>
<TE>   He wipes an ashy finger on his jeans jacket, on which he has
ironed -- as on much of his clothing -- rose patches. In recent
years, Femino has driven floats created by Fiesta Parade Floats,
where he works.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow drivers say Femino's record is remarkable because of the
stamina and nerve it takes to drive a float, with only a steel frame
and a covering of flowers separating the operator from a worldwide TV
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a compartment with a huge V-8 engine, the temperature often
tops 120 degrees. Visibility is poor; an observer in the front of the
float communicates -- by headset, cell phone or, if electronics fail,
a system of knocks on the float's steel structure -- when to turn or
stop.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers put up with flower petals and seeds that fall on their
heads and get in their eyes. And if the float stops or malfunctions
for more than 30 seconds, it gets towed. That is likely to cost the
driver's employer, the float builder, thousands of dollars in fines
at the early February meeting of the "tow board," the Tournament of
Roses' version of traffic court.</TE>
<TE>   Floats are filled with gauges -- oil, water, battery -- but most
drivers say their only concern is getting to the end of the parade,
no matter the cost to their health or their vehicle. If the choice is
between ruining a $5,000 engine or being towed and having the float
builder lose a $300,000 account with a sponsor, there is no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens in there, my job is to just keep going," says
Steve Altmayer, who has been driving floats for more than 20 years.
"Sometimes, if things are going bad, I won't even look at the gauges.
I'm not going to stop and I'm not going to be towed."</TE>
<TE>   Femino built his record on similar perseverance. In 1948, the
teenager walked into a warehouse at the municipal airport in
Alhambra, where floats were being built. The son of immigrant
Sicilian furniture makers who lived in Arcadia, he was hired as a
carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, Femino -- then 15 -- volunteered to drive a Rose Parade
float. No one asked his age or whether he had a driver's license. So
Femino drove a float sponsored by the Native Sons and Daughters of
the Golden West down Colorado Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got hooked, man," he says. "It's something that gives you
pleasure from within. They are so big and you drive them on city
streets. Who gets to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Driving a float is, of course, seasonal work. The rest of the
year, Femino searched for other excitement. He rode in traveling
rodeos. He shoed horses at Santa Anita Park and other race tracks
around the country. And under the stage name James Howard, he worked
in movies and television, playing a succession of bums, Italian
heavies or cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a free spirit," says Femino, who has been married twice and
has two kids. He's still married, but his wife moved back to Texas
years ago "because of the earthquakes," he says. "I'm not the easiest
guy. I do what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   One constant in his life has been driving floats. Some of the
first ones he operated were 90 feet long, which made turning the
things an adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Now, floats are typically limited to 55 feet in length and built
on a reusable steel chassis. Floats have automatic transmissions and
duplicate systems -- two brakes, two batteries, two fuel pumps. They
also have more power. As a publicity stunt two years ago, a float
builder named Tim Estes drove a float 35 miles per hour at Irwindale
Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Driving them, however, is still uncomfortable. Fans designed to
supply air to the driver often blow seeds into his mouth. The seats
are metal or wood without cushioning. There is no safety belt. The
heat is unbearable. Drivers dress in layers early on Jan. 1 and peel
off clothing as they head down the route.</TE>
<TE>   "By the end of the parade, I'll have stripped down to my skin and
taken off everything but my pants," Femino says.</TE>
<TE>   Femino has been at the wheel of a towed float only once -- in
1977, when he blew a tire. In 1960, the float he was driving caught
fire just before the parade. He escaped unharmed and, after the
flames were doused, navigated the float down the parade route.</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, it is not the parade itself but the drive to the
parade -- "the convoy" in parade parlance -- that worries Femino
most.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the parade, convoying is done at night, making it even
darker inside the float. The trip from Fiesta's barn in Duarte to the
formation area can take eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a police escort and a tow truck to provide power, Femino
must steer through passing traffic and avoid overhead power lines.</TE>
<TE>   Accidents are common. If the float does not arrive in Pasadena by
3 a.m. on Jan. 1, it is ineligible for awards and its builder may be
fined $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Once the parade is over, Femino heads home in his 1968 Mustang,
has a couple of glasses of red wine, and studies his performance on
the parade replays.</TE>
<TE>   Every December, Femino attends a dinner for float drivers. They
are an overwhelmingly male club, most of them longtime parade drivers
with friends who work for the float-building companies. Some are
truck drivers. A few are  railroad  engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The dinner is easily the most raucous event affiliated with the
often stodgy parade. The Tournament of Roses president is loudly, if
good-naturedly, booed. Drivers set off party poppers during the
last-minute instructions on safety.</TE>
<TE>   Beer flows as drivers compare their fees (from $62 for floats
built in Pasadena to $300 for floats that must make the long trip
from barns in the eastern San Gabriel Valley).</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to beat Jim," says Mark Bevan, a float driver for 36
years. He started at 15 too. At 51, he is given the best chance of
surpassing Femino one day.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do this to be part of a community of drivers," Bevan says.
"A lot of people drive once. But if you drive twice, you drive
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Femino missed three parades back when his acting career was going
strong. His 50th parade should have come last Jan. 1, but he got
sick.</TE>
<TE>   "My only regret all these years is that I've never seen a parade
live, in person," he says. "I don't think I ever will."</TE>

<LD>A veteran Los Angeles police officer was sentenced to three years of
probation Friday, after a judge reduced his drunk-driving charges to
misdemeanors.</LD>
<LD>   John Joseph Leonard, 61, was convicted earlier this month of
driving under the influence, after having a few drinks with friends
at a Moose Lodge near his Canoga Park home, then crashing his truck
into a palm tree and a metal post, seriously injuring passenger
Charles DeHart, 70.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard, a motorcycle patrolman in the San Fernando Valley, could
have been sentenced to a maximum of six years in state prison.</LD>
<TE>   DeHart, using a cane to help him walk, fellow police officers and
a veteran prosecutor asked Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Barry A. Taylor for leniency in sentencing Leonard, a first-time
offender who has been with the Los Angeles Police Department for 31
years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unusual situation," said Taylor, who found Leonard
guilty on all charges during a two-day trial in Van Nuys. "We have an
exemplary [employment] record -- at least 31 years with the
department. And we have very high blood alcohol and serious injury."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor reduced Leonard's two felony convictions to misdemeanors
and sentenced him to unsupervised probation, a mandatory five days in
a city jail and a $390 fine. Leonard's driver's license was also
revoked for a year.</TE>
<TE>   With a felony conviction, Leonard would have resigned from the
Police Department, said his attorney, Ira Salzman. Leonard is
scheduled to appear Tuesday before the LAPD's Board of Rights for a
disciplinary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard apologized to the court and said he has attended
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at least twice a week since the Jan. 29
crash. He was charged in June and relieved of duty without pay in
August, pending the outcome of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe he has an excellent chance of retaining his job,"
Salzman said.</TE>
<TE>   DeHart said he and Leonard remain friends and neighbors. "In
fact," he added, "I drove him here today."</TE>

<HD>FBI Gets Creative in Efforts to Catch Fugitives</HD>
<DH>From billboards to movie trailers, the bureau -- stretched
thin and with added duties fighting terrorism -- is open to new
ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Becerra</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an L.A. epiphany should, the idea came to FBI agent Eric Ives as
he drove on a freeway beaded with traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge: How to catch the remaining fugitives linked to a
cargo theft ring that the FBI had targeted for five years? The wanted
men were truck drivers or had connections to truck drivers. They
allegedly stole from trucks or cargo containers.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to ask yourself, 'Who's your target audience? And how do
you reach it?' " Ives said. The answer came to him on the Long Beach
Freeway, where trucks rumble to Los Angeles Harbor.</LD>
<TE>   His audience: other truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Ives, who has a degree in marketing, asked FBI officials if he
could rent a billboard in the City of Commerce overlooking the
freeway and a rail yard near the Atlantic Boulevard exit. On Dec. 5,
pictures of fugitives Eliseo Placentia Medina, 33; Billy Ray
Davenport, 49; and Rosendo Avina-Gallegos, 49 were plastered over the
sign. Eight days later, Davenport was arrested at Union Station after
a driver saw the billboard and called in a tip.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be the media coverage of the billboard that
would catch these guys," Ives said. "But the actual billboard led to
the [first] tip. I was ecstatic."</TE>
<TE>   Ives' $5,000 gambit was among the creative steps some of the
bureau's agents are increasingly trying when trails grow cold and
staff is stretched too thin, especially with the FBI's new
responsibilities for counterterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Creative, even quirky, ideas for spreading the word about
fugitives are welcome by the bureau. For instance, coming soon to a
theater near you: movie trailers featuring the FBI's most wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Chavarro, a supervisory special agent in the nation's capital,
was the first to try movie ads. Two years ago, he and other members
of a fugitive task force were looking for gang members suspected of
killings in the Washington area. Chavarro pitched the idea of
featuring their mug shots as moviegoers waited for the main
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a gang member who's wanted, and you know specific
theaters where other gang members may be going, including rival gang
members, you're more likely to reach people who know where your
fugitives are," Chavarro said.</TE>
<TE>   The first weekend that the movie ads ran, two murder suspects were
arrested, said Laura Bosley, an FBI spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Similar ads are expected to begin appearing in Los Angeles next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Garriola, a special agent in a fugitive task force that
includes LAPD and sheriff's detectives, has high hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "With fugitives, you have to be creative. You have to rely on
unusual methods, because criminals are becoming more educated on the
ways that we catch them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the fugitives he plans to profile before movies:</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Saenz, now 27, who police say killed two unarmed gang
rivals in Boyle Heights in 1998. Fearing that his girlfriend (the
mother of his child) was going to turn him in, he raped and killed
her, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   "Saenz is charged in three killings. He's good for three times
that many," Garriola said. "That guy is going to kill again."</TE>
<TE>   Garriola said he also plans to present moviegoers with a profile
of Eduardo Santana, 51, who had reportedly become obsessed with
39-year-old Guiselle Rojas.</TE>
<TE>   In June, police say, Santana ambushed her outside her
Pasadena-area home and stabbed her more than 50 times.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with theater ads and billboards is that they can be
pricey, said Rex Tomb, who is in charge of the FBI's Fugitive
Publicity Unit. There has to be a reasonable expectation of results,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the more novel ideas go through Tomb, and they don't
always come from agents.</TE>
<TE>   A few have been clever, if impractical. For instance, one vendor
proposed programming fugitive mugs into video arcade machines, so
players would glimpse them before popping in their quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else pitched the idea of passing out T-shirts with
fugitives' pictures. A good idea, Tomb said, except that as soon as
the fugitive was captured, you'd be left with a product you couldn't
return.</TE>
<TE>   The pinnacle of fugitive publicity is still the TV show "America's
Most Wanted," Tomb and other agents said. But only so many cases can
be publicized on the program.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ives' billboard still looms over the freeway. Two of
the mugs now bear stripes that read, "Captured." Six days after
Davenport was caught, Medina was arrested in South L.A., although not
as a result of the billboard. The third fugitive remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he thinks, 'I'm next,' " Ives said</TE>
<GT></GT>

capture of one of the pictured fugitives. Another was arrested last
week, but not because of the sign, which now has a second "Captured"
stripe.</CP>

<HD>2 Blazes Leave 11 Homeless</HD>
<DH>Apartments in Simi Valley and a house in Thousand Oaks are
burned. A candle and material near a water heater are likely causes.</DH>

<LD>A house fire in Thousand Oaks and an apartment blaze in Simi Valley
left 11 people homeless Friday, including a 10-month-old boy, and
caused nearly $700,000 in damage.</LD>
<LD>   About 7:55 a.m., a garage fire destroyed a family's three-bedroom
residence in the 500 block of Houston Drive in Thousand Oaks,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Two neighbors -- an infant with heart problems and her grandmother
-- were hospitalized as a result of the blaze, which produced
billowing black smoke visible from two blocks away. Investigators
later determined that the fire was caused by combustible materials
stored too close to a water heater.</LD>
<TE>   About a dozen engines, ladder trucks and other vehicles responded
to the blaze, and it took Ventura County Fire Department personnel
about 90 minutes to control the fire, which left the two-story wooden
dwelling a blackened, smoldering skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimate that the fire caused $250,000 in damage to the
structure and $20,000 to its contents. "The house is pretty well
gutted," said Capt. Mark Taillon, one of the firefighters whose
trucks crowded the narrow residential street.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday in Simi Valley, an unattended candle sparked a
blaze that caused more than $400,000 in damage to a 16-unit apartment
building in the 800 block of Country Club Drive, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   There were no major injuries in the 1:45 a.m. blaze, but one
firefighter was cut on his cheek when he was struck by falling
debris, authorities said. At least two apartments were destroyed,
displacing seven adults and one child. Red Cross officials made hotel
arrangements for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   As firefighters began looking through the charred remains in the
Thousand Oaks fire, other crew members were dousing the interior with
hoses. "We don't want the fire to rekindle after we've left the
scene," Taillon said.</TE>
<TE>   Before investigators could inspect the upstairs, firefighters
installed two-by-four beams to support the second story.</TE>
<TE>   The home's owner, Wayne Olson, who owns a video production company
in Newbury Park, was leaving for the office when he noticed a
suspicious odor.</TE>
<TE>   "I smelled something, but we had just put on the heater. And it
wasn't that strong until I walked out the front door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said he dropped a video camera and ran back inside to get
his wife, Rosemary, and their 10-month-old son, Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Olson, wearing a brace on her right wrist from an earlier
accident, said it was fortunate that her husband left later than
usual Friday, or she and their son might have been trapped in a
downstairs bedroom near the garage.</TE>
<TE>   Standing across the street in a neighbor's driveway, Wayne Olson
lamented the loss of belongings and paperwork -- including several
business checks he hadn't cashed -- but said he was able to save one
of the family's five cats, a 16-year-old named Sartre. A 13-year-old
cat turned up later, but officials believe the other three may have
perished in the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty devastating to them," said Cecilia Cuevas of the
Ventura County American Red Cross. "Because of that trauma, we
dispatched a mental health counselor to work with the family."</TE>
<TE>   The charity bought baby food and diapers for Joseph and arranged
for Wayne Olson, who is diabetic, to pick up needles and an insulin
prescription, Cuevas said. The family also received vouchers for
temporary shelter, clothing and food.</TE>
<TE>   Aid also was extended to the household next door, where Maria
Olivo and her infant granddaughter, Zahamit Kissoon, were taken to
Los Robles Regional Medical Center to be treated for smoke
inhalation. Olivo was quickly released, but the 1 1/2-month-old was
taken by helicopter to UCLA Medical Center, where she was treated for
preexisting heart and lung problems.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said he was thankful the camera he carried from his home
contained Christmas videos of his son, and that family photographs
are safely downloaded onto a computer at work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad he's not older," Olson said. "He won't remember a lot
of this."</TE>

<HD>Simi Residents Blame Illnesses on Lab</HD>
<DH>Several Orangewood district neighbors, who live a few miles
from the Rocketdyne facility, have either cancer or thyroid
conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several longtime residents of a Simi Valley neighborhood suffer from
lung cancer or the thyroid condition Graves' disease. And they think
they might know why: contamination from a nearby rocket-testing site.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Stanford Lovett met some of his ill neighbors for the
first time Dec. 11 at a public hearing on the cleanup of the Santa
Susana Field Laboratory, where missiles were often tested during the
Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   As they traded stories, Lovett realized his neighbors' symptoms
sounded uncomfortably familiar: rapid weight loss, lack of muscle
control, heart palpitations, throbbing headaches, irritability and
severe night sweats.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe what I was hearing," said Lovett, 42, who has
lived in the Orangewood tract of Simi Valley for nearly two decades.
The neighborhood near Erringer Road and Cochran Street is about three
miles from the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Since that meeting at the Grand Vista Hotel in Simi Valley, Lovett
and his new friends have talked on the telephone several times to
figure out what to do next, if anything. They think the
rocket-testing site operated by Rocketdyne, a division of aerospace
giant Boeing, is to blame for producing soil and air pollutants that
have attacked their thyroid glands. The gland serves as a sort of
thermostat for the body.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials say they are not responsible for residents'
maladies and maintain that any chemicals and toxins generated by the
hilltop site have been contained within its 2,668 acres. State
investigators say they cannot prove the 54-year-old site was the
source of perchlorate discovered this year in 18 wells in or near
Simi Valley. Perchlorate is a highly toxic chemical used in rocket
fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, 315 people from Simi Valley and the west San
Fernando Valley filed lawsuits against Rocketdyne for allegedly
causing them to become sick or their loved ones to die.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett and his neighbors are not party to those complaints and
said they had not been aware they existed. The cases remain tied up
in federal court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Orangewood is not the closest neighborhood in Simi Valley to the
lab site. That distinction goes to Santa Susana Knolls in the
foothills below Rocketdyne.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett's neighbor, David Plunkett, said he is compiling a database
of everyone he meets in Simi Valley who has cancer or a
thyroid-related illness, such as Graves' disease. His wife,
Christina, 38, was diagnosed early this year with hyperthyroidism --
a condition that causes her metabolism to speed up.</TE>
<TE>   "People are popping up all over the place with Graves' disease and
thyroid problems," said Christina Plunkett, who is tall and rail
thin.</TE>
<TE>   The Plunketts have lived in the area for 10 years. David is
healthy, but their 7-year-old son has cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   Christina said her symptoms appeared more than a year ago, when
she started experiencing heart palpitations, her hair fell out and
she lost 55 pounds in two months. Her condition deteriorated to the
point that she had to quit her job as a waitress. She remains in
constant pain and shakes all the time, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Ralph Lopez, lived in the neighborhood for eight
years before moving to Moorpark two years ago. The 54-year-old real
estate agent was diagnosed with Graves' disease nearly two years ago
after his weight plunged.</TE>
<TE>   "People said I looked good, but I was having other problems,"
Lopez said. He finally saw his doctor after waking up in the middle
of the night covered in sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett said he went from hyperthyroidism two years ago to
hypothyroidism, which produces symptoms associated with a slowed-down
metabolism. Now his doctor suspects he may have Sjogren's syndrome,
an autoimmune disorder that attacks the saliva glands.</TE>
<TE>   With stiffness in his legs, arms, fingers and feet, his condition
makes it difficult for him to walk. His wife helps him up and down
the stairs of their home and into his pajamas at night.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, his perplexed doctor sent him to the National
Institutes of Health in Maryland, where he underwent tests for a rare
disorder called Stiff Man's syndrome. He is awaiting the results.</TE>
<TE>   "So many things are so out of whack, the doctors don't understand
what's going on," Lovett said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Quynh Tran, 52, was diagnosed with lung cancer
in July 2001. A resident of Simi Valley for nearly 20 years, he lives
around the corner from the Plunketts. Tran, a software engineer for
Columbia Pictures, said one of his brothers-in-law, who lived nearby,
died of lung cancer 10 years ago. Neither he nor his brother-in-law
smoked, Tran said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother and another brother-in-law, both residents in the same
neighborhood, also suffered from thyroid-related conditions, which
have since stabilized, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UCLA are conducting a health study of residents
living near the Rocketdyne site under a federal initiative sponsored
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. But the
study involves only cancer rates, not thyroid disorders, said Bert
Cooper, who is overseeing the project.</TE>
<TE>   The study was launched in 1999 at the request of U.S. Sens.
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both California Democrats, and
Congressman Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) after residents began
coming down with cancer and other diseases. The study should be
completed in another year, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett said any information will make residents feel better.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that is killing people," Lovett said. "My wife
is scared right now, living in Simi Valley."</TE>

<KH>REFLECTIONS ON 2002: HEALTH</KH>
<HD>Wounded System Remains on Its Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Los Angeles County
health-care system in 2002 was avoiding complete collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Core programs such as emergency and trauma care remained intact as
voters endorsed a property tax increase that will yield $168 million
annually.</LD>
<LD>   But the county's reprieve came at a cost to its poorest residents,
who saw 16 health centers closed and cutbacks at dozens of private
clinics. More than 455,000 patient visits were eliminated and about
100,000 patients were affected.</LD>
<TE>   With the state struggling to close a deficit of nearly $35 billion
and the federal government insisting that it won't grant another
bailout, the county health department may face another year on a
financial precipice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like hanging around in the hut, waiting for the
avalanche to hit -- and hoping that it doesn't come," said Yolanda
Vera, senior health policy attorney with Neighborhood Legal Services
of Los Angeles County, which advocates for indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some people already feel the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Mayer, an uninsured 41-year-old diabetic, used to seek care
at the county's Azusa Health Center, less than 2 1/2 miles from his
home, until the clinic closed in September. Now he travels 11 miles
to the El Monte Health Center, or 22 miles to Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center, for doctor visits and prescription refills.</TE>
<TE>   Walk-in patients at El Monte often wait four hours to be seen by a
doctor or nurse, said Mayer, who has had eye and foot complications
from diabetes. The wait for prescriptions also can take hours.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit there all day long," Mayer said. "You have to go real
early in the morning just to see the doctor.... If they have too many
people, they'll tell me to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Things may deteriorate in 2003. The Board of Supervisors is poised
to close the county's two hospitals without emergency rooms: High
Desert Hospital in the Antelope Valley and Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Noyola, a patient resource worker at Rancho, said she is
concerned about her job and about where disabled patients will find
care if the decision to close the hospital stands. Rancho, which is
nationally known for its innovative treatments, sees about 9,500
people each year for a variety of catastrophic injuries and ailments,
including stroke and diabetes, liver problems and spinal cord and
head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a single mother and I have to feed my child, so yes, it
worries me," said Noyola, 26, of Downey. "There has to be better ways
for them to find money than just closing this place."</TE>
<TE>   But the cuts could have been much worse. In the summer, county
officials proposed closing the emergency rooms and inpatient services
at two of the four full-service public hospitals -- Harbor-UCLA and
Olive View-UCLA medical centers -- if new money weren't found.</TE>
<TE>   County voters gave the facilities a reprieve on election day,
voting to raise their property taxes to fund emergency and trauma
care.</TE>
<TE>   The tax initiative, called Measure B, got more votes than any
person or issue on the county ballot. It will raise taxes by 3 cents
for every square foot of residential and commercial development, or
about $45 for a 1,500-square-foot home.</TE>
<TE>   "The most painful decisions have been at least put off
temporarily, if not permanently," said Linda Rosenstock, dean of
UCLA's School of Public Health. "For that, I think we can credit the
public's concern about their own access to emergency services."</TE>
<TE>   $210-Million Shortfall</TE>
<TE>   Even with the new property taxes, conservative projections
indicate that the county faces a health deficit of at least $210
million within three years. Discussions are continuing with state and
federal officials on how to bridge the gap.</TE>
<TE>   A top federal health official, Tom Scully, has said repeatedly
that the government does not plan to bail out the county, but it does
want to help the county navigate its budget crisis without
drastically reducing patient care.</TE>
<TE>   In the private sector as well, hospitals struggled through 2002.
Tenet Healthcare Corp. closed St. Luke Medical Center in northeast
Pasadena, leaving the city with only one full-service hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The same company announced plans to close Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital, citing financial problems. But a coalition of community
activists fought Tenet's decision. And the state attorney general's
office, which oversees the sale of nonprofit hospitals to for-profit
companies, successfully petitioned a Superior Court judge to halt the
closing temporarily because Tenet had not lived up to the terms of
its purchase deal. To date, the hospital remains open.</TE>
<TE>   Financial troubles extended to three San Fernando Valley hospitals
whose operators filed for bankruptcy protection recently after a
lender didn't deliver needed funding. Granada Hills Community
Hospital, Pacifica Hospital of the Valley and Pine Grove Hospital
remain open as they reorganize their debts.</TE>
<TE>   Other Challenges</TE>
<TE>   In addition to budget problems, many hospitals encountered other
challenges: preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack, alleviating
emergency room congestion and implementing state regulations that set
minimum ratios of nurses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses unions, appealing to members' dismay over cutbacks and
tight staffing, made huge gains in organizing drives in Southern
California. Earlier this month, the California Nurses Assn. won its
campaign to organize 1,500 registered nurses at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, the largest private hospital in the West. The hospital is
challenging the results.</TE>
<TE>   The same union also won its first contract this month for 1,300
nurses at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Though possibly worst in Los Angeles County, the looming financial
crisis in health care was a major theme statewide. To lighten demand
for services, Gov. Gray Davis in May proposed raising the income
limit for families to qualify for Medi-Cal, increasing required
paperwork, and cutting dental, chiropractic and other so-called
optional benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature rejected those cuts, but did allow the governor to
delay the expansion of the much-touted Healthy Families program to
include working poor parents.</TE>
<TE>   The state's budget problems worsened though, and the governor has
proposed many of the same cuts again.</TE>
<TE>   State officials estimate that about 500,000 people would be pared
from the Medi-Cal rolls -- either for failing to fill out paperwork
or for not meeting new income limits.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's latest proposals would pare $167.5 million from the
general fund's $11-billion budget for Medi-Cal, which covers 6.4
million indigent, elderly and disabled adults and children.</TE>
<TE>   Health advocate Anthony Wright described the cuts as a "full
assault on the health-care system."</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder for a working family to be eligible for health
insurance. It's harder to get enrolled. It's harder for them to stay
on. And if they do manage to do all that, they will have fewer
benefits and fewer providers," said Wright, executive director of the
group Health Access.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, who took over this year as Los Angeles
County's director of health services, acknowledged that the
atmosphere in health care will be uncertain for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is health care -- there's so many unpredictable pieces," he
said. "I don't see that we're going to have the luxury of stability
for quite a few years into the future."</TE>

health-care cuts.</CP>

<HD>U.S. Raises Stakes in Water Battle</HD>
<DH>Bush administration says it will slash farmers' allocation
at once if a deal isn't reached by Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In a move that escalates pressure on the Imperial Irrigation District
to sign a long-term water deal with coastal Southern California, the
Bush administration announced Friday that it will immediately cut
water allocations to farmers in the Imperial Valley if a deal is not
signed by New Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   The move marks the first attempt by the federal government to
enforce a key part of a U.S. Supreme Court decision meant to stop
California from using more than its share of water from the Colorado
River. The Department of the Interior announced the impending action
as part of its annual plan for divvying up the Colorado River among
seven Western states.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley said that the Imperial
district's mammoth allocation from the Colorado River will be cut
about 7%, unless it agrees to sell water to the San Diego County
Water Authority. California as a whole would lose as much as 15% of
its share of the Colorado -- a heavier sanction because it has
overused the river even more than the farming county.</LD>
<TE>   The cuts of Imperial Valley's water are based on its alleged
violations of a 1979 decree that supplemented the historic 1964
Supreme Court decision backing Arizona in its water fight with
California, Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   The decree set limits on how much water farmers could use per
acre. The Imperial district, Raley said, is roughly 5% over those
per-acre limits. He added that further cuts may be ordered.</TE>
<TE>   But the Imperial district's top lawyer, John Carter, immediately
branded the move illegal and hinted that the agency might sue. Carter
said that Raley's boss, Interior Secretary Gale Norton, would be "in
violation of our water rights and existing agreements" if she carries
through on the threatened reduction.</TE>
<TE>   In the Imperial Valley, where lavish use of cheap water from the
Colorado River turned a desert into a $1-billion-a-year agricultural
economy, no issue is more incendiary than a perceived threat to the
valley's water rights. A previous tentative agreement also called on
farmers in the valley to take some of their land out of cultivation
-- another hot-button issue.</TE>
<TE>   Other states that depend on the Colorado River have been
pressuring the federal government for years to enforce the Supreme
Court decision and end the practice of sending so-called surplus
water to California. Those demands have grown louder as drought has
beset much of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Raley denied that he was attempting to pressure Imperial. Instead,
he said, he was merely pointing out how allocations from the Colorado
River will differ depending on whether the water transfer is
approved.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is not to provide motivation" for Imperial to sign the
agreement, Raley said. "We simply wanted the parties to understand
the two paths and what they mean for 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Under the complicated "water order" plan announced by Raley, the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California would be denied
shipments of surplus water from the Colorado River if it, San Diego,
the Imperial district and the Coachella Valley Water District cannot
reach an agreement on the proposed 75-year sale of water from
Imperial to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But the Metropolitan Water District would be partly compensated
because it would receive most of the water that would be denied to
the Imperial district. The net effect would be to replace about 30%
of the water lost to the Metropolitan Water District because the
surplus shipments are being ended.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Raley's announcement, officials at the Metropolitan
district, which serves 17 million people in six Southern California
counties, had said that the mega-district could compensate for the
loss of surplus water for two to three years with water being stored
in reservoirs and aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   "We concluded we could manage [if surplus water were ended]," said
Ronald Gastelum, the Metropolitan district's president and chief
executive officer. "If [the Raley plan] is the way things come down
in 2003, it will only enhance our ability to manage."</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial district board is scheduled to meet Monday in El
Centro to discuss the Interior Department's decision and status of
negotiations between the four agencies to reach an agreement before
Tuesday's midnight deadline. In an agreement with other Colorado
River states two years ago, California was promised 15 years of
surplus water if the San Diego-Imperial deal was finalized by the end
of this year. The pact would be the largest transfer of water from
farms to cities in the nation and a major step toward reducing
California's overreliance on the Colorado. After seven years of
on-again, off-again negotiations, the Imperial board defiantly
rejected a proposed 75-year deal on Dec. 9, despite the looming
deadline and threats of retaliation from the state and federal
governments.</TE>
<TE>   The major obstacle is the future of the Salton Sea, the stinky,
discolored body of water that straddles Imperial and Riverside
counties and survives on agricultural runoff. If the Imperial
district sells water to San Diego, it will decrease the amount of
runoff, which will make the Salton Sea smaller, even more
foul-smelling and more lethal to birds and fish.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial directors are worried that the district could be ordered
to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for environmental restoration
projects for the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Although its problems of salinity and toxicity have been
well-known for decades, the sea was not considered a major impediment
in the San Diego-Imperial deal until recently. "It just wasn't on
anybody's radar screen," said Joseph Sax, a Northern California
lawyer and water expert who served as counsel to former Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</TE>
<TE>   Only recently has the environmental movement focused on the Salton
Sea, leading to a lawsuit against the federal government. A report
from the Bureau of Reclamation on possible solutions to the sea's
problems is overdue, although even when the report is issued, it will
not provide any money.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent meeting of the Colorado River Water Users Assn. in
Las Vegas, Norton said the Imperial district is asking for a kind of
protection from the federal Endangered Species Act that no agency in
the country enjoys.</TE>
<TE>   Although a bill sponsored by state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica) and signed by Gov. Gray Davis provides some protection for
the Imperial district from state environmental laws, much of that
protection is set to phase out on New Year's Day, if the San
Diego-Imperial deal is not signed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Salton Sea issue is very big," said Brent Haddad, who teaches
environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. "It calls into question
agricultural practices, water rights, public health, ecological
protection, property rights -- nearly everything."</TE>
<TE>   Under various laws governing how the river is allocated,
California is assured of 4.4 million acre-feet a year, 75% of which
belongs to three agricultural irrigation districts. The Imperial
Irrigation District, which provides water for 140,000 residents and
500,000 acres of farmland, is the biggest of the three.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan district has been receiving 600,000 acre-feet to
800,000 acre-feet of surplus water from the Colorado River, in
addition to its assured allocation of 550,000 acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, California has been receiving about 5.2 million
acre-feet. Raley's plan would reduce that to 4.4 million acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   Under the water order plan announced by Raley, the Metropolitan
district would receive a total of 713,000 acre-feet if the
Imperial-San Diego deal is not signed and 1.1 million acre-feet if it
is.</TE>
<TE>   No state draws as much as California from the Colorado River. In
fact, no state draws as much as the Imperial Irrigation District. The
district entitlement to the lion's share of the river comes from the
fact that pioneers staked their claim more than 100 years ago.</TE>

<HD>Police Fear Man Took Girlfriend, 12, to Mexico</HD>
<DH>Her parents were letting the 30-year-old court their
daughter, say astonished investigators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Becerra</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old man who was allowed to court a 12-year-old Mid-City
girl has kidnapped her and may be headed to Mexico, police said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Geronimo Luevanos Galvan was last seen at 1 p.m. Thursday with
Petra Ponce at a McDonald's restaurant near Pico Boulevard and Hi
Point Street, said LAPD Lt. Stan Ludwig.</LD>
<LD>   There, Galvan gave the girl's 17-year-old brother a note
expressing his "affection for the girl and his desire to be with
her," Ludwig said. The girl left voluntarily with Galvan, he said. An
unnamed witness in the area told police Galvan mentioned going to
Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   However, for reasons that detectives said they are still puzzling
over, the brother chose to wait seven hours before telling his
parents about the note.</TE>
<TE>   "Had he mentioned the note sooner, it would have given us a big
head start," Ludwig said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they were further befuddled that the girl's
parents, whose names have not been released, would allow a romantic
relationship between the man and their daughter. Police said Galvan
met the girl more than six months ago in the neighborhood and got
permission from her parents to visit her frequently at their house.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still surprised parents would allow this to happen," Ludwig
said. "Basically, we have a 12-year-old dealing with a 30-year-old
man.... Because of her age, she cannot give consent."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the couple's five children have been taken into
protective custody, Ludwig said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have notified the California Highway Patrol, the Border
Patrol, U.S. Customs and other law enforcement agencies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Galvan was driving a blue 1987 Honda Civic with the license plate
number 4XQP889. An Amber alert was not issued because there was no
forcible abduction, Ludwig said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are still interviewing the parents and the teenage
brother. Ludwig said police suspect that Galvan has had prior contact
with at least one other underage girl. He said he hopes any victims
will come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call detectives at (213)
847-3998 or a 24-hour number at (213) 485-4022.</TE>

<HD>Stars' Doctor Profited on Weakness, Records Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Rohrlich and Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the California Medical Board revoked Dr. Jules Lusman's
physician's license earlier this month, he was widely identified as a
doctor who catered to celebrities, prescribing drugs to Winona Ryder
and other members of the Hollywood elite.</LD>
<LD>   Catering to the needs of stars with an appetite for narcotics,
however, was only part of Lusman's practice. An examination of
Medical Board and court records provides a picture of a doctor who
also prospered from the weaknesses of the less glamorous -- patients
who were mentally unstable, chronically ill or merely frail. He
solicited patients through ads in the Yellow Pages and fliers at
Westside hotels and took financial advantage of them where he could,
the records indicate.</LD>
<LD>   There was, for example, the well-to-do Demerol addict who couldn't
find his Rolex watch. At first, the patient figured the cleaning lady
must have put it away. A short time later, though, he found the
expensive timepiece in an unexpected place: wrapped around Lusman's
wrist.</LD>
<TE>   When he accused Lusman of stealing the watch, the doctor presented
him with a bill of sale, the patient told a Medical Board
investigator. The addict concluded that he must have turned over the
watch while in a narcotic haze.</TE>
<TE>   Medical Board files show Lusman, 49, practiced largely outside the
realm of hospitals, where his habits might have come to the attention
of authorities sooner through routine peer reviews. He was a general
practitioner who made house and hotel calls. He also ran a hair
transplant business out of his Wilshire Boulevard office in Santa
Monica, and performed laser skin resurfacing procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The man with the Rolex, identified in Medical Board records as a
patient in his 30s with the initials R.V., said he found Lusman in a
Yellow Pages ad that offered house calls. An hour after he called,
R.V. told Medical Board investigators, Lusman was at his Westside
apartment, injecting him with Demerol to relieve a migraine headache.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman began coming to his apartment two to five times a week,
injecting R.V. with Demerol and leaving him pre-filled syringes so
that he could later inject himself, the patient told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that Lusman began calling him to say that he was in the
area and that he had some 'medicine,' " a Medical Board investigator
related. In a period of a week, Lusman sold R.V. approximately 25
pre-filled Demerol syringes, the patient told investigators. Over two
months, Lusman charged him about $20,000 for Demerol injections, R.V.
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another patient -- a mentally unstable man who later committed
suicide -- sued Lusman, saying he was swindled out of $20,000 and a
piece of art. The case was settled.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, Lusman borrowed $164,000 from a patient, the
Medical Board charged. Lusman allegedly began asking still another
patient to co-sign his mortgage after injecting her with Demerol.</TE>
<TE>   A state administrative law judge condemned Lusman this fall for
his medical practices, saying that the doctor "routinely resorted to
narcotics as his answer to complaints of pain ... while charging
hundreds or even thousands of dollars for consultations." The judge,
Joseph D. Montoya, recommended that Lusman's license to practice
medicine be revoked, and the California Medical Board did just that.</TE>
<TE>   'More of a Car Salesman'</TE>
<TE>   Lusman was "more of a car salesman than a doctor," said a former
employee. "A drug pusher with a medical license," said the Medical
Board's chief of enforcement. "A predator," said a lawyer for one of
Lusman's patients.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman, who returned earlier this month to his native South
Africa, has asked the courts to set aside the Medical Board ruling.
He has said he merely tried to help patients in pain.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor also noted that no testimony was presented at his
disciplinary hearing about many of the financial irregularities the
Medical Board alleged. The hearing instead focused on Lusman's
patient records, which showed a pattern of prescribing narcotics,
often without adequate patient histories or examinations, and without
trying other treatments first, the judge found.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman represented himself at the hearings and did not testify,
asserting his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. But he
was loquacious in an interview with a Times reporter while the
hearings were underway early this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, he offered a spirited defense of his narcotic
treatments: "Some doctors don't have any experience with narcotics,
so they don't feel comfortable administering them," Lusman said. "I
am quite experienced. I've had a lot of anesthesia training. So I am
very comfortable with narcotics. I've treated pain. I try other
treatments, but when you are dealing with intractable pain, you are
dealing with patients who have tried everything and nothing works.
The accusations made against me were all fabricated."</TE>
<TE>   Lusman's former administrative assistant, Sadie Batres, said in an
interview that Lusman sometimes acted like a salesman: A patient
would come in with a cold and Lusman would point out a facial
blemish, using the opportunity to sell a laser treatment. But Batres
said the biggest part of his practice was dispensing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman marketed himself by distributing brochures to concierges at
Westside hotels, Batres said, and got regular referrals to guests
wanting medical attention. He saw far more patients outside of his
office than in it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Batres said in a sworn statement to the Medical Board that Lusman
had "violent mood swings." She said he frequently yelled at her and
behaved oddly, signing her name to his own business correspondence
and once crashing through a parking lot gate when he did not have
enough cash to pay an attendant.</TE>
<TE>   Lusman also had problems paying his bills. A review of civil court
files revealed that he was sued more than a dozen times over the last
decade, often by business associates alleging failures to pay his
debts on time -- or at all.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a strange guy," said Stuart Schneider, a lawyer
representing office-building owners whom Lusman owed $10,000 in back
rent. "He gave me the impression that even though he owed my client a
substantial sum of money, that we should be doing him a favor by
allowing him to stay in the suite."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first complaints the Medical Board received about
Lusman involved a frail Pacific Palisades woman in her mid-30s. The
patient had a host of medical and psychiatric problems, including
chronic migraine headaches that sometimes left her confined to bed in
a dark room for days.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that the woman, identified as S.O. in Medical Board
files, had tried Demerol and barbiturates before and gotten hooked.
The drugs had aggravated her headaches, and she had gone though
withdrawal from the drugs at a hospital. Her headaches lessened.</TE>
<TE>   But one day in July 1996, S.O. had a panic attack. Unable to reach
her own doctors, she picked up the phone book and found Lusman's ad.</TE>
<TE>   He showed up promptly and began seeing her almost daily. He gave
her Demerol, leaving filled syringes so that she could inject
herself. While she was under the influence, the Medical Board
charged, Lusman tried to get her to co-sign for his mortgage and
introduce him to her husband, with whom he allegedly hoped to develop
a business relationship. Eventually, the woman and her husband
complained to the Medical Board. But a big fight ensued over access
to her medical records.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints Mount</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the patient with the Rolex misadventure complained, and
so did an ailing 69-year-old man who met Lusman while staying at the
Doubletree Hotel. The man, identified in records as R.H., had an
oceanfront apartment in Santa Monica, but had checked into the hotel
so he could get room service. Concerned about his blood pressure, he
said in a court declaration, he called the concierge to recommend a
doctor and "they sent over" Lusman. The doctor prescribed sleeping
pills and blood pressure medication. He saw the man again the next
day at the hotel. The following day, the man checked out, records
show.</TE>
<TE>   R.H. had previously been diagnosed as manic-depressive, but was
not taking his prescription medication. He recalled being out of
sorts. When Lusman visited him at his apartment the next day, the
doctor took the opportunity to sort through R.H.'s financial papers,
which had been spread on a bed.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that I was going to be rich because I owned a lot of good
stocks," R.H. said in a court declaration. Lusman left, R.H. said,
with a check for $20,000 that he promised to invest for R.H. and an
expensive Japanese print that he said he would have appraised.
Instead, the doctor put the print on consignment at an art gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "Had my judgment not been impaired, I would never have agreed to
write a complete stranger a $20,000 check or to let a complete
stranger leave with my Japanese print," R.H. said. R.H. was so
unbalanced that he was found wandering the streets in a daze the next
morning and taken to a psychiatric hospital. Lusman eventually
returned the money and the print as part of the settlement of a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The final expansion of the Medical Board's case against Lusman
began in May 2001 with a complaint from a source regarding Lusman's
treatment of C.W., a woman in her early 50s who had a history of
abusing heroin. Investigators obtained C.W.'s prescription records
from about a dozen pharmacies near Lusman's office. They learned
that, over a five-year period, C.W. had received at least 240
prescriptions from Lusman. In one 13-month period alone, she received
157, according to Medical Board files.</TE>
<TE>   The check of pharmacy records led authorities to search Lusman's
office and home. The search turned up evidence of Lusman's connection
to Ryder. In addition, scattered near his bed, investigators found "a
number of spent syringes," according to one source familiar with the
investigation. In an interview with The Times earlier this year,
Lusman said the syringes had been planted by investigators.</TE>

<HD>Court Backs Muslim Inmates</HD>
<DH>Appellate panel says they can't be disciplined for
attending prayer service and that beards grown for religious reasons
can't be banned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California prison officials cannot discipline Muslim inmates for
attending a Friday afternoon prayer service, a federal appeals court
ruled Friday in a decision that also touches on the power of cities
to restrict the location of places of worship.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also let stand a lower court
decision that allows inmates to grow beards for religious reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 ruling was the first by a federal appeals court on the
constitutionality of a 2-year-old federal law that gives religious
groups greater flexibility in dealing with zoning ordinances and also
requires prison officials to make reasonable accommodations to
inmates' religious practices.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's ruling benefits a group of Muslim inmates at the
California State Prison, Solano, in Vacaville who filed a
class-action lawsuit six years ago, contending that prison officials
were illegally burdening their religious practices.</TE>
<TE>   The inmates challenged regulations that imposed discipline on them
for leaving prison jobs for the Friday noontime Jumu'ah religious
service and that took away good-work credits for the entire day if an
inmate attended the hourlong service.</TE>
<TE>   Constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky of the USC Law
School said the ruling upholding the constitutionality of the law was
significant, with ramifications outside of prisons.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he said, religious groups would now have a stronger
argument if they were trying to erect a church or synagogue in an
area zoned for homes only, because a court might rule that the zoning
law represented an unwarranted "substantial burden" on the free
exercise of religion.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling, Judge Dorothy W. Nelson wrote: "Protecting
religious worship in institutions from substantial and illegitimate
burdens does promote the general welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1st Amendment, by prohibiting laws that proscribe the free
exercise of religion, demonstrates the great value placed on
protecting religious worship from impermissible government intrusion.
By ensuring that governments do not act to burden the exercise of
religion in institutions," the federal law "is clearly in line with
this positive constitutional value."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit rebuffed arguments by the California attorney
general's office that the federal law passed in 2000, called the
Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, violated the
constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion and
other clauses of the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The judges cited a 1987 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held
that Congress could withhold 5% of a state's federal highway funds
unless the state had a minimum drinking age of 21.</TE>
<TE>   Constitutional law professor Jesse Choper of UC Berkeley's Boalt
Hall said the ruling is "in accord with existing Supreme Court
doctrine" on Congress' power to condition the distribution of federal
funds to states on compliance with certain federal mandates.</TE>
<TE>   In the opinion joined by Judges Mary M. Schroeder and Johnnie B.
Rawlinson, Nelson wrote that "Congress has a strong interest in
making certain that federal funds do not subsidize conduct that
infringes individual liberties, such as the free practice of one's
religion. The federal government also has a strong interest in
monitoring the treatment of federal inmates housed in state prisons
and in contributing to their rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling upheld a series of injunctions issued on behalf of the
inmates by U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision will make it easier for inmates to practice their
religion," said Sacramento attorney Susan D. Christian. "I think the
ruling is very important, because the prison now has to demonstrate
that its regulation addresses a compelling state interest, and they
have to show that the regulation is being implemented with the least
restrictive means.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously," she said, "all the prison officials had to do was
say the regulation was needed for 'security' reasons, and courts said
it was OK."</TE>
<TE>   Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Corrections, said it was too soon to say whether the agency would
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   She said the department had adhered to the injunctions, which
immediately affected about 300 to 350 Muslim inmates at the Solano
County prison, which is between Sacramento and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Bach said there may be wide ramifications, because there are
Muslims in most California prisons, and Islam "is the fastest-growing
religion" among inmates in the state's prison system.</TE>
<TE>   She said prison officials were concerned that if inmates got
good-time work credit for the periods they spent in Muslim
observances, other groups might ask for similar benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling, the court also let stand a lower court decision
barring enforcement of a California prison regulation banning beards
worn for religious purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Bach said that although the prison will honor that, the Department
of Corrections remained concerned about it.</TE>
<TE>   Prison administrators said the ban was designed to help readily
identify inmates and help prevent escapes, find escapees and control
movement within prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim inmates had argued that the beards were a requirement of
their religion.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Karlton had said a half-inch beard posed no problem.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County criminal defense attorney who has been at the center
of some of the county's most sensational cases was named a Superior
Court judge Friday by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Goethals joins the Orange County bench after a 25-year
legal career that was divided between terms as a deputy district
attorney and private practice. As a prosecutor, he won three
death-penalty verdicts and numerous high-profile convictions.</LD>
<LD>   "I personally cannot think of a better appointment for the
governor," said Maury Evans, a retired senior prosecutor who once
supervised Goethals in the district attorney's office. "He's very,
very bright and one of the most ethical people I've met."</LD>
<TE>   "He's a very gifted courtroom lawyer. He has a superb temperament
for judicial office," said Ronald Brower, one of Orange County's most
experienced criminal defense lawyers and a former colleague of
Goethals' in the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Goethals, 50, said the appointment is one of the biggest thrills
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's not appointing a lot of criminal defense lawyers,
so I feel fortunate that he chose to appoint me," he said.</TE>

<HD>Digging Into Heritage</HD>
<DH>Long Beach woman has drawn the anger of her landlord and
the goodwill of many admirers with Chumash rituals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cecilia Garcia's mother had Alzheimer's disease and her father was
dying when she decided to build a small Native American-style
ceremonial fire in the backyard of her Long Beach home, much as her
grandparents had done in times of crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Once Garcia grabbed a shovel and started digging -- purposefully,
forcefully, tearfully -- that day in April 1996, she couldn't stop.</LD>
<LD>   She envisioned people needing a place to sit, so she dug deep and
carved benches out of the dirt walls. Later, she created a wide, flat
rim for dancers, planted herbs and cactus on the edges and splashed
bright blue, red and green paint on the sides.</LD>
<TE>   Now 6 feet deep and 70 feet in circumference, the fire pit is a
place where dozens of people gather under the full moon to dance and
chant with the woman they believe is a Chumash Indian medicine woman.
Her landlord, Edward Sanchez, and city officials, however, call the
pit the obsession of an eccentric deadbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's asinine, and it's costing me money," said Sanchez, 70, who
believes the excavation is driving down the value of his
2,800-square-foot lot. "But she's a stubborn lady; a real fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Some would call that an understatement. On Monday, Sanchez lost
his third attempt in Los Angeles County Superior Court to evict the
tall, thin woman who wears owlish glasses, is partial to loud colors
and speaks in a blend of street jive and New Age bromides.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's response to the victory: "I'm going to dig a little
deeper."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 47, prides herself on immersing guests in monthly Chumash
Indian experiences in the heart of a low-income neighborhood
surrounded by modest stucco homes and factory buildings.</TE>
<TE>   A six-foot chain-link fence separating her yard from a neighbor's
is draped in old Indian blankets. A three-foot berm decorated with
river rock and elk horns hides the pit from the sidewalk.
Entertainment includes shaking rattles and singing beside a fire
spiced with sage and eucalyptus leaves.</TE>
<TE>   She does not charge a fee for attending her rituals, but she
accepts donations.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who got the idea from her grandfather, said she
intentionally made the pit deeper than she is tall to give it the
feel of being a world apart.</TE>
<TE>   But the prime attraction is Garcia, who is part Chumash and was
raised in East Los Angeles before drifting around the world for two
decades, working on fishing trawlers and shrimp boats.</TE>
<TE>   The 40 to 60 guests who huddle around her fire on the north side
of town are treated to Garcia's interpretations of Indian ways, the
mysteries of life and healing rituals.</TE>
<TE>   They also learn the best places in the Santa Monica and San
Gabriel mountain ranges to gather herbs, as well as how to use them
in cleansing rituals.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia snapped a small branch of sage in two, inhaled the aroma of
its sap and said: "People change in the pit. Call it psychotherapy --
whatever. A fire is a connection to family, health, hobbies, positive
attitudes. You don't have to be an Indian to feel its goodness."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter of support sent to Los Angeles Superior Court
Commissioner Thomas H. Parrott in February, Mark F. Acuna of the
Gabrieleno-Tongva Tribal Council, said: "This is no barbecue, this is
no backyard cookout. This is no Scouting adventure. This is religion
at its most basic."</TE>
<TE>   "All of our peoples have traditions of 'fire,' 'song,' and
'dance,' " he said. "These three are inseparable. Our spiritual lives
depend on and are focused on the continuous antiquity of these three
in their relation to the land on which we live."</TE>
<TE>   More serious to Sanchez were the city health and safety officials
who began snooping around his property after noticing the pit while
paving an adjacent alley in the 2100 block of Lemon Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   After repeated efforts to bring Garcia's yard up to code, the
city's effort lost steam when she and her supporters accused
officials of infringing on religious rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them, 'Don't make me sue you,' " recalled the
self-proclaimed curandera, or healer. "Back off."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez tried to have Garcia evicted when she failed to pay her
rent of $450 a month in October and November. Garcia, however, argued
that she was legally withholding rental payments until Sanchez made
good on his promise to rid her cream-colored rental of rodents, fix
damaged screens, patch gaps in the foundation and dispose of dead
pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   After 2 1/2 hours of testimony Monday, Parrot ordered Sanchez to
complete the repairs, and ordered Garcia to pay the $1,012.50 in back
rent by Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But Garcia, who gets by on donations of money, food, clothing and
even vehicles, doesn't have to move.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, she said, she gave the landlord a cashier's check for
the full amount.</TE>
<TE>   Not that she was ever in doubt that she would find the funds.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, standing in the muddy pit and admiring her
handiwork, she said: "I'll come up with the rent money. In fact,
someone just called to say they want to donate $500."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Cecilia, how about we raise funds with a 'Keep the Fire Pit
Going' fire?" suggested Garcia's friend, Long Beach artist Uran
Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   "Good idea," said Garcia, striding up a short flight of stairs
leading out of the pit. "There's something about a fire that brings
people together."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's Grounds for Joy: Snaring Starbucks</HD>
<DH>Coffeehouse once was skeptical; now it's set to open its
third store.  "It's a sign that your community has made it," says one
expert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago, the decision-makers at Starbucks had their doubts
about downtown Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Although the coffeehouse chain had become commonplace in most
communities, there was a feeling that it wouldn't translate in a
Latino-dominated city like Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a perception that Starbucks was a white, middle-class
place," said Jim Spillane, a regional development director for the
coffeehouse chain. He said corporate executives quickly decided that
impression was off base.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Ana now has two Starbucks and a third was recently approved
by the City Council, reflecting a trend that has rippled across
Latino neighborhoods. San Fernando, Pico Rivera and Chula Vista all
have recently opened Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years ago, we couldn't get a Starbucks if we tried," said
Santa Ana Councilman Jose Solorio. "We were the largest city in
Orange County and we had no Starbucks. Now we have two in full
operation and others underway."</TE>
<TE>   Some communities are trying to limit chain outlets such as
Starbucks, but Robert Thompson, professor of media and popular
culture at Syracuse University, said he understands why Santa Ana
officials are so happy to finally have the Starbucks name in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign that your community has made it," said Thompson. "It
used to be a fancy city hall or a church steeple. Now if you have
Starbucks, people think, 'How bad could this city be?' And whatever
goes wrong, we can always have a good cup of moccachino."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hennessey, who will be Starbucks' landlord at the new
location at 17th Street and Tustin Avenue, said, "I think it is a
huge validation ... that the city is going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Luring Starbucks wasn't easy. City Manager David N. Ream said that
only after years of discussion about various locations did the first
Starbucks open four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to open one in the downtown for years but they were not
convinced," said Ream. "For us, we wanted a known restaurant or
retail entity in the downtown. It means something."</TE>
<TE>   The company is looking at three other sites in Santa Ana,
including drive-through operations like the one recently approved,
Spillane said.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that even after opening an initial site, the company
soured on the city after slow sales at the Santa Ana Boulevard
location.</TE>
<TE>   The second Starbucks at the Hutton Centre office complex opened
seven months ago and is close to South Coast Plaza. The newly
approved location on 17th Street is on the other side of town.</TE>
<TE>   For coffee drinkers, the arrival of Starbucks is heartening.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love Starbucks coffee and for me, it's been almost a
personal insult that they couldn't come to Santa Ana," said Paula
Luevano, a Santa Ana mother of three who has a coffee holder clipped
to her baby stroller. "I'm really glad to hear that they might be
opening more stores here."</TE>

<HD>San Juan to Appeal Verdict in Landslide</HD>
<DH>City will seek reversal of a $1.5-million award to owners
of two parcels in San Clemente.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Juan Capistrano will appeal last week's $1.5-million verdict
against the city in which jurors found that its negligence in
maintaining hiking trails caused a 10-acre landslide that damaged two
private properties in San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   El Nino storms waterlogged the trails, triggering the 1997 slide,
jurors ruled.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to neglecting drainage, San Juan Capistrano hasn't
sufficiently repaired 30-foot crevices the slide created, said Serge
Tomassian, an Irvine attorney who represented the property owners.</LD>
<TE>   "They don't understand their duty to make sure these cracks don't
open up again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing San Juan say the city filled the fissures
and that they present no danger to passersby.</TE>
<TE>   As for the drainage issues, the city has no obligation to provide
maintenance that extensive to its open space, said Ed Richards, the
Santa Ana attorney whose firm represented San Juan Capistrano. He
added that because a landslide starts from the bottom, soaked hiking
trails at the slide area's summit could not have been its cause.</TE>
<TE>   The city regularly inspects and fixes the trails, but requiring
more upkeep of open space is cost-prohibitive and makes it difficult
to keep the property in its natural state, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   "What this decision says is that cities need to spend the money to
go out there, pave this roadway and put in permanent drainage service
-- and just completely destroy what it is they're trying to
preserve," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.5 million will cover repairs for property owners Margaret
Rozbicka, who lost almost half of her 7-acre parcel, and Raymond and
Saundra Hoyal, who own a 1 1/2-acre tract, 400 square feet of which
was damaged in the slide.</TE>

<HD>Victims of '90 Oil Spill Settle for $4 Million</HD>
<DH>Proposed deal would end 12 years of litigation over
American Trader disaster off Huntington. Money will go to about 250
people, merchants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 200 fishermen, oceanfront businesses and property owners
will share $4 million to settle the last remaining lawsuit from a
disastrous 1990 tanker accident that fouled the Orange County coast
with nearly half a million gallons of Alaskan crude oil.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, if approved next month by a federal judge, will
close the books on one of the state's worst oil spills and end a
12-year-old court battle that turned into a bitter paper war with
attorneys for the ship owner.</LD>
<LD>   "This is good news. I was wondering if they were going to wait
until all of us were dead," said Dale Sleight, 54, a former
lobsterman from Garden Grove who claims his fishing business was
ruined by the spill. "If this comes through, it will be a windfall. I
thought nothing would ever come of this."</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, a $4-million fund would be set up
for about 250 businesses and individuals who claimed they suffered
financial losses from the February 1990 disaster that occurred when
the American Trader hit its own anchor while mooring at an offshore
terminal near Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The spill affected 15 miles of Orange County coastline, closing
beaches, harbors and waters just off shore for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Among those seeking damages are members of the historic Newport
Beach dory fleet, fish canneries in San Pedro, and the 296-room
Hilton in Huntington Beach, which had been preparing its grand
opening when the crude washed ashore. The group of business owners
originally sought $14 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The case has dragged on so long that some of the original
plaintiffs have died, including Giuseppe Cracchiolo, a commercial
fisherman from San Pedro, and Timothy Meek, a 33-year-old dory man
who disappeared off the Newport Beach coast in 1998 while trying to
catch enough fish to buy his son a bicycle for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the settlement fund, court records state that the
defendants will pay the plaintiffs' legal fees and court costs, to be
determined at a later date. Also in those papers, they denied any
wrongdoing in connection with the spill.</TE>
<TE>   Named as defendants are BP America Inc.; Golden West Refining Co.,
the terminal operator; Attransco Inc., the tanker owner; and
Brandenburger Marine Inc., the employer of the American Trader's
harbor pilot. The class-action lawsuit was filed against them in U.S.
District Court seven days after the spill.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides finally came to a settlement agreement after several
months of discussions and filed the proposed terms in court Dec. 20.
Judge Robert J. Kelleher will rule on the proposal Jan. 13.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," said Shawn Millbern, a senior vice president
with Robert Mayer Corp., which owns the Waterfront Hilton Beach
Resort, which originally sought $2.7 million in damages. "This is
certainly good Christmas news."</TE>
<TE>   The spill had a wide and immediate effect. The bountiful
Huntington Flats fishing grounds were temporarily shut down. Harbor
entrances were sealed off, preventing tour boats, Catalina-bound
ferries and fishing boats from going to sea. Visitors, conventioneers
and tourists canceled hotel reservations or cut short their stays.
Meanwhile, owners of beachfront vacation rentals said they had a
difficult time attracting renters for months.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing," said Douglas Edlund, 61, a Corona del Mar real estate
investor who has asked for $6,500 in lost income from an oceanfront
duplex on 66th Street in Newport Beach. "Everybody's got to be happy
to see this come to a conclusion. With all the costs of going to
court, I am glad to see there is something left for people making
claims."</TE>
<TE>   John Reilly, an attorney for the tanker owner, declined to discuss
the case, citing a confidentiality agreement that prohibits
discussing the lawsuit with the media unless both sides agree to it.
Gretchen Nelson, one of several attorneys for the plaintiffs, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the fisherman, businesses, and property owners have
blamed the long court fight on the American Traders' defense team.
The same motions were filed repeatedly, they said, and there were
five attempts by the defense to dismiss the case, all unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that the tanker company has fought to prevent
other defendants from settling the case, and an entire year was
consumed by a defense appeal that was ruled to be groundless. Even
Kelleher has said the matter should have been resolved years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the American Trader attribute the delay to the
complexity of the case, the large number of people seeking damages
and a web of parallel litigation, including actions by state and
federal authorities to recover their own damages from the spill.</TE>
<TE>   The state and federal lawsuits, which ended in 1999, resulted in
$30 million in settlements to recover cleanup costs and to pay for a
variety of restoration projects for seabirds and marine life in
Orange County. The sites include continuing efforts at Bolsa Chica
and the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve.</TE>

<HD>Plot to Hit Russian Embassy Alleged</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Islamic militants arrested in Paris during the last two weeks planned
to attack Russian interests and particularly wanted to hit Moscow's
embassy in Paris, the French Interior Ministry said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The ministry identified one of the group as Menad Benchellali and
said his brother, Mourad, is being held at the U.S. naval base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after U.S. forces arrested him in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Menad Benchellali and two of the other militants had received
training at a camp in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, where they met Chechen
guerrilla leaders and senior Al Qaeda operatives who were experts in
using toxic materials, the ministry said.</LD>
<TE>   It said one suspect also spoke of possible attacks against
"Israelis in Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   French police have arrested nine suspected Islamic militants since
Dec. 16 hoping to track down a network believed to have recruited
young Muslim men in recent years to train with Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Police questioning revealed that the three men who allegedly
planned to attack Russian targets were part of the same underground
cell even though they were arrested in different raids.</TE>
<TE>   During the raids, police found a list of chemicals and their
prices, videotapes of fighting in Chechnya, and materials to forge
documents, the ministry statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The cell planned to attack Russian targets to avenge the death of
Khattab, an Arab-born Chechen guerrilla leader killed by Russian
troops, according to the ministry. Khattab claimed close links with
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Island of Diversity</HD>
<DH>Chichi Jima is home to scores of 'Westerners,' who count
Americans among their forebears. But the wider culture is slowly
subsuming them.</DH>

<DL>CHICHI JIMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>This remote scythe-shaped island appears small and insignificant from
the deck of a ferry. Visitors stagger down the gangplank after the
25-hour trip from Tokyo to find palm trees and white-sand beaches
reminiscent of countless other specks of paradise dotting the
Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   A closer look at Chichi Jima's residents, however, reveals
something a bit incongruous. Among the local Japanese citizens
shopping on the sleepy main street or waiting at one of the two
stoplights are many with distinctly European features. They sport
Japanese variations of such names as Washington, Gonzalez and Savory
and use language laced with the occasional English, Polynesian and
Melanesian word.</LD>
<LD>   These foreign-looking citizens, numbering fewer than 200, are
descendants of beached sailors, swashbucklers and ne'er-do-wells who
settled here decades ahead of the Japanese; their rich legacy befits
the island's strategic location on 19th century whaling routes at
Japan's edge.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the beer cans, mail sacks and packaged noodles arriving
every few days from Tokyo, however, are powerful currents that in
recent years have threatened this unique corner of Japan: the
introduction a decade ago of television; growing intermarriage with
mainland Japanese; the gradual dying off of the older generation; and
the exodus of youngsters for better jobs and brighter lights.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to teach my children our customs before it's too
late," said Abel Savory, 73, the great-grandson of original 1830
settler Nathaniel Savory. "Since we went through so much trouble, I
don't want them to forget."</TE>
<TE>   Today the "Westerners" -- as descendants of the original settlers
call themselves, despite being a mix of European, Polynesian,
Melanesian and Azorean stocks -- are increasingly integrated into
mainstream Japanese society. Where they once lived in distinct
neighborhoods, their homes are now sprinkled throughout the island's
modest residential district. One of the few visible reminders of the
past is the Yankee Town bar near an area that once held a Westerners
neighborhood of the same name.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the Westerners spoke a mix of English, Japanese and
Polynesian. Today, Japanese is the only language used by almost
everyone under 40. And while the old-timers still converse in the
local patois among themselves, they're under strong pressure to speak
standard Japanese, particularly when outsiders are within earshot.</TE>
<TE>   The island is also looking more like the rest of rural Japan. Most
of the houses and shops are relatively modern, built in the last few
decades as part of the nation's protracted construction boom. On one
side of the port, government housing blocks rise like oversized
dominoes at an angle to the nearby mountains. On the other, a couple
of modest grocery stores offer the same brands of packaged rice, bean
paste and fish sauce found throughout Japan.</TE>
<TE>   A few Westerners have managed to keep a link to their seaborne
past by, for instance, operating sightseeing boats for tourists. But
the outrigger canoes once used extensively by local fishermen have
all but disappeared, and the vast majority of residents live off
state pensions, government jobs or the tourist trade.</TE>
<TE>   During peak periods, including the New Year's holiday, the
island's population of about 2,000 temporarily doubles, with many
visitors sleeping on the ships that brought them in hopes of viewing
the year's first sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tourists see few traces of the island's rich history.
They view Chichi Jima, the main island in the Ogasawara chain, as
little more than a nice place for diving, kayaking and forgetting the
stress of Tokyo for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are hints of the island's special character.
Departing ferries still bring out crowds sending off friends and
relatives, complete with a taiko drum salute, in a reminder that
mainland Japan is still a faraway place.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, visitors to the Ogasawara Islands, known in the
West as the Bonin Islands, have included the famous and infamous.
Commodore Matthew Perry and author Jack London spent time on Chichi
Jima. In 1944, former President George H.W. Bush, then a 20-year-old
Navy pilot, was shot down offshore and rescued by an American
submarine. During World War II, cannibalism also paid a grim visit.</TE>
<TE>   The island over the last 172 years has also seen feuds, family
infighting, murder and wartime casualties disproportionate to its
3-by-5-mile area.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, tensions remain between those who favored postwar
Japanese rule and those who looked to the United States, between
residents supporting an airport and those who oppose development; and
between families with different bloodlines. In some cases, neighbors
and family members are barely on speaking terms despite their close
proximity.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, divisions appeared early as a ragtag group made up of two
Americans, three Europeans and about 20 Pacific islanders landed in
June 1830 from Honolulu with some vague idea of creating a British
outpost.</TE>
<TE>   They found fresh water, decent land and good fishing on the
previously deserted island and soon prospered as whaling ships
stopped for fresh water and trade. Drifters, mutineers and deserters
came and went, revenge and justice were often synonymous, and murder
was relatively common.</TE>
<TE>   An 1838 document tells of original settler Mateo Mozarro's attempt
to hire someone to kill American Nathaniel Savory.</TE>
<TE>   "He said for me ... to make friends with Savory and when he turns
his head ... to beat his Brains out with a club, and if that did not
kill him to stab him with a knife until dead and throw him into the
sea," said would-be hit man Francis Silver.</TE>
<TE>   Without Western women, the men acquired or kidnapped wives from
neighboring islands. The 1836 log of a passing ship speaks of white
men with "one or two wives," widespread infidelity, and infanticide
practiced by mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Undefended Chichi Jima was an easy target for pirates, including
marauders in 1849 who stole Nathaniel Savory's gold and woman. Then
again, historians believe she told the pirates which wall housed his
stash.</TE>
<TE>   Commodore Perry, famous for forcing open Japanese trade at the
barrel of a gun, arrived in 1853 aboard the Saratoga and bought a
plot of land for $50 from Savory. The parcel was the first Far East
territory to come under U.S. control. Washington, however, failed to
embrace Perry's dream of a coaling station and eventual missionary
base at the site.</TE>
<TE>   In 1893, writer-adventurer Jack London arrived at age 17 aboard a
seal-hunting ship, then got dead drunk and lost his wallet, watch,
coat, belt and shoes to ruffians.</TE>
<TE>   Inward-looking Japan, meanwhile, roughly 600 miles to the
northwest, had known of the islands for centuries. They got their
name from rogue samurai Sadato Ogasawara, who in 1727 falsely claimed
that his ancestors had discovered them.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't very honorable, but he had a talent to make all this
up," said Hiroyuki Tanaka, a Japanese historian.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese modernization, beginning in the 1860s, sparked greater
interest in the islands. Japanese settlers arrived in 1862, built a
Shinto shrine and left before returning for good in 1876. They
informed the bemused residents that the territory was now Japan but
that they were free to stay and become Japanese. In the settlers'
absence, the Westerners had tended their shrine.</TE>
<TE>   The rising Japanese population prompted Westerners -- many based
in Yankeetown -- to consider their own identity. They avoided
marrying the new arrivals, tried to safeguard their language and
culture, and even built a church after shunning religion for decades,
said Daniel Long, associate professor of linguistics at Tokyo
Metropolitan University and an Ogasawara Islands expert.</TE>
<TE>   Economic lives were intertwined, however. Both groups enjoyed sumo
tournaments and festivals. To this day, Westerners are buried in
Anglican ceremonies with a follow-up service 49 days later, a
Buddhist tradition. And tombs are adorned with sake and rice
crackers.</TE>
<TE>   As war clouds spread in advance of World War II, the Ogasawara
Islands acquired new strategic importance as a bridge to other
Pacific islands. Fortified docks and giant radio towers were rapidly
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   The Westerners' foreign appearance was viewed with growing
distrust.</TE>
<TE>   "They were constantly suspicious that we were spies," said Aisaku
Ogasawara, who also goes by Isaac Gonzalez and is minister of the
Chapel of Peace church.</TE>
<TE>   English was banned, and Westerners were ordered to change their
foreign names. The Gilleys, for instance, became the Nozawas or
Minamis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, with the war turning against Japan, civilians were
evacuated to the mainland. Many faced discrimination, as mainlanders
refused to believe they were Japanese or give them food. Abel
Savory's father was stabbed in the stomach with bamboo spears after
locals mistook him for a downed American pilot, before police stepped
in to rescue him.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military considered invading Chichi Jima but opted
instead in February 1945 to land on nearby Iwo Jima. Starvation
became rampant as Chichi Jima came under nonstop air raids.</TE>
<TE>   "It just rained American bombs," recalled Jeffrey Gilley, who also
goes by Nozawa. He was drafted into the local military and remained
on the island.</TE>
<TE>   Like most residents, Gilley had been taught to sacrifice
everything for the emperor, although his foreign features remained a
divider. One day in 1943, fellow Japanese soldiers had seized him and
tied him to a stake for 24 hours in hopes U.S. pilots would consider
him American and hold their fire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle I'm alive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Japanese soldiers brought out a young American
who had been imprisoned for several months in a cave, blindfolded him
and tied him up. As a crowd gathered, a Japanese officer beheaded the
man, whose face Gilley still recalls. That night, the troops had
curry rice with meat for the first time in years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very special, since we'd lived for years on miso soup and
rice," said Gilley, 78, in his modest Chichi Jima house. "Only later
did I learn we'd eaten the soldier."</TE>
<TE>   Chichi Jima was evacuated after the war. But in 1946, the
Americans let 120 Westerners return to the islands, by then a U.S.
protectorate. The United States was reportedly swayed by the
Westerners' foreign appearance, as well as by the mistreatment they'd
suffered and their ancestors' role in helping Perry.</TE>
<TE>   It would be 23 years before Japanese residents were allowed to
come back.</TE>
<TE>   Life in the interim was relaxed, and English became the
predominant language again, although a series of caves near the port
remained under constant guard by machine-gun-toting Marines.
Westerners would jokingly call mysterious lead-encased containers
they saw obake, or ghosts.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all a bit suspicious," recalled Rance Ohira, or Rance
Washington, 52, owner of the Yankee Town bar.</TE>
<TE>   Recently declassified military records show that the island housed
nuclear weapons. According to the January 2000 Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, the Pentagon feared that mainland Japan and Okinawa would
be knocked out by a Soviet first strike and saw Chichi Jima and Iwo
Jima as reloading depots for submarines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, the Ogasawara Islands were returned to Japan, sparking
the occasional land dispute between Westerners and returning
Japanese. The U.S. allowed Westerners for a limited time to choose
their nationality. A large number stayed, however, viewing the island
as home no matter who controlled it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult time," said Francis Gonzalez, or Ichiro Kishi,
owner of Chichi Jima's Cosmo gas station. "We were caught between two
worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Today, most Westerners find themselves in an increasingly Japanese
world.</TE>
<TE>   "My generation is now in our 70s, and I don't know if our
lifestyle will survive the next generation," said Ogasawara, the
minister. "Eventually, even our features will be lost as we
intermarry with Japanese."</TE>
<TE>   Minority languages and cultures around the world are under
pressure from their mainstream counterparts. "But this is probably
the only place where the endangered indigenous language turns out to
be English," said Long, the professor. "The irony is incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Some Westerners chafe at the island's isolation, favoring a
long-proposed airport. Emergency medical care -- involving several
steps that include military aircraft -- is at least 11 hours away, a
growing concern for aging residents.</TE>
<TE>   Westerner families differ on how they view the past. Etsuko Savory
is teaching her kids to make New England-style dumpling soup, and her
son recently traveled to Massachusetts to meet the American Savorys,
while Francis Gonzalez is content to see his daughter grow up
Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make a decision at some point," he said. "I don't
want her to get caught in the middle like me."</TE>
<TE>   The older generation that lived through so much, meanwhile, is
rapidly disappearing. Abel Savory was recently found to have lung
cancer and given less than a year to live, although he continues
windsurfing, a sport he learned at 48.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an old man now. I want to pass on our traditions," he said as
he sat in his yard surrounded by his outrigger canoe, windsurfing
gear and rusting three-pronged spear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only one left, for instance, who knows how to make the
four-tier funeral wreaths. I joke with youngsters that they better
make me a nice one when I go."</TE>

<LD>Ukraine's Supreme Court barred a criminal probe of President Leonid
D. Kuchma, saying it had been opened illegally.</LD>
<LD>   Appellate Judge Yury Vasilenko in Kiev had ordered prosecutors to
investigate opposition charges against Kuchma of corruption, abuse of
power and arms sales to Iraq. Opposition leaders also accuse Kuchma
of involvement in the murder of reporter Georgi Gongadze. The
president denies all the charges.</LD>

<HD>46 Killed in Suicide Assault on Government Offices in
Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Two vehicles laden with explosives blow up at the
pro-Russian regime's headquarters in the separatist republic. The
toll could rise sharply.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A double suicide bomb attack on the headquarters of the pro-Kremlin
government in Chechnya's capital killed at least 46 people Friday and
cast new doubt on Russia's claims that life in the separatist
republic is returning to normal.</LD>
<LD>   The bombing, which came on the heels of a spectacular
hostage-taking by Chechen rebels at a Moscow theater in October,
undermined Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's assertion that
Moscow has crushed resistance in the republic. Putin has announced
that there will be a referendum in Chechnya in March designed to set
up elections for a new government and formally end the state of war
there.</LD>
<LD>   In Friday's early afternoon attack in Grozny, kamikazes drove a
truck and a military jeep loaded with explosives through three
cordons around the government building and detonated the bombs. One
left a crater 5 yards across and several yards deep.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 people work in the four-story building, the symbol of
Moscow's rule in Chechnya. At least 76 people were injured, and
others were buried in the rubble. Officials said the death toll could
rise sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Russian television showed bodies strewn across the square in front
of the building. People stumbled about dazed, with bloodied faces,
while rescuers, lacking stretchers, carried away the limp bodies of
unconscious or dead victims.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were pulled from the wreckage, and emergency teams
were working Friday night with truck lights trained on the scene, but
officials were pessimistic about pulling more people out alive.</TE>
<TE>   Shamsail Saraliyev, press secretary to the leader of the
pro-Moscow administration, was in the building when it was rocked by
the blast. He told the television station TVS: "It all happened very
quickly. There was zero visibility. Suddenly, everything started to
tumble down. And immediately, moans and screams filled the air."</TE>
<TE>   He quoted Akhmad Kadyrov, the leader of the administration, as
blaming rebel commander and former Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
for the attack. Kadyrov was reportedly in Moscow at the time of the
blast.</TE>
<TE>   "This act of terror was carried out in order to disrupt the
stability in the republic which is preparing to hold a referendum and
elections," Saraliyev said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Maskhadov, Ahmed Zakayev, denied that the leader
was responsible for what he called "a terrorist act" and a tragedy
for the Chechen people.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, others will assess what happened today in the
context of Chechnya's everyday life as a successful act of
retribution by the Chechens," Zakayev said on the Chechenpress Web
site, the main outlet for the separatists. "Needless to say, many on
the Chechen side viewed this building as a strategic target housing a
bunch of the most zealous promoters of the anti-Chechen terrorist
war.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chechen leadership expresses its profound condolences to the
relatives of the latest victims of the Russian-</TE>
<TE>   Chechen conflict. Denouncing any terrorist acts, the Chechen
leadership insists that the Russian-Chechen conflict cannot be
settled by force," he said, calling for international intervention to
pressure Russia to negotiate with the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials are trying to extradite Zakayev from Britain for
alleged terrorist acts, having recently failed to persuade Danish
authorities to hand him over.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide attacks in Chechnya are not common but have been used
before. The rebels who attacked the Moscow theater had explosives
strapped to their bodies and threatened to blow themselves and the
theater up.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, there were several suicide attacks in Chechnya, including
an attack against a military barracks in the town of Argun, which
killed more than 25 Russian servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   October's attack on the Moscow theater hardened Russian attitudes
toward Chechnya, with 64% having favored tougher military action
against the rebels in a November survey conducted by the polling firm
Romir.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin's hard-line military approach, criticized by
international human rights groups, has neither delivered stability
and peace in Chechnya nor brought an end to terrorist attacks in
Moscow and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The theater attack shocked Muscovites and raised questions about
Putin's Chechen policy, but those were dispelled by the storming of
the theater by special forces. It was widely seen as a success by
Russians, even though the sleeping gas used in the operation killed
all but two of the 129 people who died.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, no one claimed responsibility for the Grozny attack,
but Chechen rebels rarely make such claims. Some Russian officials
blamed another Chechen commander, Shamil Basayev, for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Ilya Shabalkin, a spokesman for Russia's regional military
headquarters, told the NTV television station by phone that the only
possible conclusion was that Basayev and Abu Walid, an Arab commander
in Chechnya, were responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "According to our intelligence, the terrorist act was possible
because money is still being channeled to Chechnya from a number of
Arab countries," he said, without elaborating. "This is what has
enabled the rebels to assemble the explosive devices and enlist the
suicide drivers."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Khakim Sultygov, appointed by Putin as Russia's human rights
commissioner for Chechnya, told NTV that those responsible were
trying to show that the referendum and elections are impossible, in a
bid to force negotiations with the rebel side.</TE>
<TE>   "These barbarians commit their villainous crimes in agony," he
declared, adding that the separatists are waging war on their own
people.</TE>
<TE>   Many Russian officials, including the chairman of the Central
Election Commission, Alexander Veshnyakov, insisted that the
referendum should go ahead despite the instability.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of all these acts of terror is to intimidate the
population and to disrupt the process of political settlement of the
Chechen republic's problems by peaceful means. And this scenario
[canceling the referendum] plays into the hands of the terrorists,"
he warned.</TE>
<TE>   But Vladimir Kulakov, vice chairman of the security and defense
committee in the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament,
told TVS that it is premature to talk about elections in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making steps toward developing a civic society that would
live according to civilian rules. Unfortunately, terrorists do not
want the same thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Akhmar Zavgayev, a Chechen representative in the Federation
Council, told NTV that the Chechen administration will press on with
the referendum regardless of the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's incident bears witness to what kind of people Maskhadov
and his closest entourage are. We will hold the referendum anyway,"
said Zavgayev, vowing to make life tougher for the rebels so that the
"ground will be burning beneath their feet."</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials condemned the attack, and Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell called Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov
to express condolences.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sending 25,000 Troops to Persian Gulf</HD>
<DH>Those deployed will join 57,000 now in position for a
strike on Iraq. One Pentagon official calls the move 'saber-rattling'
to buttress U.N. efforts.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a major mobilization for possible war with Iraq, the Pentagon this
week ordered about 25,000 military personnel to the Persian Gulf and
instructed the Navy to prepare two aircraft carriers for rapid
deployment to the region, Defense Department officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The deployments of air, sea and land forces were described by
Pentagon officials as the largest to date as the United States
continues assembling the pieces for an invasion of Iraq that many
believe could come in February.</LD>
<LD>   The movements are expected to unfold over several weeks, starting
within days of the arrival of the New Year. They involve Air Force
fighter and bomber wings, Army infantry units, air mobile units and a
Navy hospital ship. Units are to be drawn from bases across the
nation.</LD>
<TE>   "The potential conflict in Iraq is about to become very real to
Americans all across the country," said a senior military official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush approved the plan last week in a White House
session with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Army Gen. Tommy
Franks, who would lead U.S. forces in any invasion of Iraq. But the
orders weren't sent out until after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   When the movements are completed, the Pentagon will have
positioned about half the 50,000 troops officials had previously
indicated they would be moving to the region. They will join an
estimated 57,000 troops already in position.</TE>
<TE>   Officials indicated that a second deployment will come soon,
although they refused to say when.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue our steady buildup," another senior
military official said.</TE>
<TE>   He and others at the Pentagon confirmed that there are two
objectives. One is to ratchet up pressure on Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions to disarm. The other is to have enough military firepower
in the region to respond quickly -- within weeks, if not days -- if
invasion orders come from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to help the diplomatic process as much as possible,"
one official said. Another said: "This is saber-rattling. Iraq is
going to have the saber at their door pretty soon."</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, near where Bush is spending 10 days at his
ranch, Scott McClellan, the deputy White House press secretary,
refused to comment, saying, "We don't discuss military matters,
including deployments."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has been moving forces and equipment into the Gulf
region since early this year.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the movement has been primarily of equipment and
materiel, not of large numbers of troops. Officials said the new
deployments mark the start of a more visible phase of the military
buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reached that time where the next big thing we're doing is
high optics," or highly visible, a senior U.S. official said. "If the
president is going to decide to go to war early next year, a lot of
very visible, real world things have to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Starting Thursday, enough warplanes and fighter pilots to launch a
comprehensive air campaign will begin moving to air bases in Qatar,
Kuwait, Bahrain and other nations surrounding Iraq, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   First to go will be the 1st Fighter Wing and its fleet of 54 F-15C
fighter jets, based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia; the 4th
Fighter Wing and its 92 F-15E Strike Eagles from Seymour Johnson Air
Force Base in North Carolina; and the 28th Bomb Wing, flying B-1B
Lancers out of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, said Maj.
Roger Lawson, a spokesman for Air Combat Command, which oversees all
combat Air Force units based in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Also deploying will be the 57th Wing, based at Nellis Air Force
Base in Nevada, Lawson said. It will be flying HH-60 helicopters and
the Predator aerial unmanned vehicle. The 347th Rescue Wing at Moody
Air Force Base in Georgia has also been ordered to deploy its combat
search-and-rescue assets, including its fleet of HC-130 airplanes,
Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Army has been ordered to deploy light infantry and air mobile
units to the Iraq region, a senior military official said. Army
officials would not comment on which of their units have received
deployment orders.</TE>
<TE>   The Army troops most likely to be deployed first from the U.S. in
the event of war are the 4th Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry
Division, the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Air Assault
Division. An Army division also could move from U.S. bases in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are getting put in place," said Jim Wilkinson, spokesman
for Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East
and Southwest Asia. "The president has made no decision, and we don't
comment on specific mobilization orders. However, assets are moving
to the region should the president decide to use them for any
contingency."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy was ordered to prepare two aircraft carriers -- one from
the East Coast and one from the West -- for quick deployment to the
Gulf next month. Although it's not certain that the carriers would be
sent, the vessels are to be ready to ship out within 96 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy already has two carriers in the region: the Constellation
in the Gulf and the Harry S Truman in the Mediterranean Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has not had more than two carriers in position
around Iraq, except for short periods during rotations, since the end
of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said two nuclear-powered carriers that have left the
Gulf will probably be readied for redeployment. One, the George
Washington, recently returned to its home port in Norfolk, Va. The
other, the Abraham Lincoln, has not been selected but is expected to
be. It was stopped in Perth, Australia, on its way back to its home
port at Everett, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Each carrier has about 75 warplanes and 5,000 sailors, and is
accompanied by its own escort of destroyers, cruisers and submarines.
The United States launched thousands of sorties from six carriers
stationed in the Middle East during the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The only immediate deployment for the Navy, however, involves one
of its vast hospital ships, the Comfort. The 946-foot vessel, berthed
in Baltimore, is equipped to operate as a 1,000-bed floating hospital
with two operating rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary mission is to provide flexible medical response to
support wartime operations," said Marge Holtz, director of public
affairs for the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command. "She is
equipped to care for the victims of all types of medical trauma,
including the effects of a chemical or biological attack."</TE>
<TE>   Holtz said the Comfort won't set sail until late next week or the
beginning of the following week at the earliest, to give the 225
active-duty Navy personnel and 61 civilian mariners who operate the
ship time to load "enormous" amounts of medical supplies onto it.</TE>
<TE>   Once it embarks, it will take three weeks to arrive at its
destination, she said. Medical personnel will fly in to a location
near the Comfort's destination and be helicoptered to the ship once
it arrives, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether Marines were involved in the latest
deployment orders. More than 2,200 Marines and sailors who are part
of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit are already set to leave Camp
Pendleton as part of the Tarawa Amphibious Ready Group in early
January for the Gulf, officials at that sprawling Southern California
base said. Those orders were issued weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made on whether the Marines will go by ship
or transport planes, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit were the first
conventional U.S. troops into Afghanistan last year.</TE>

<HD>Poland Will Buy 48 Fighter Jets From Lockheed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley And Ela Kasprzycka</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WARSAW</DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin's F-16 came out the winner Friday in a dogfight
between U.S. and European manufacturers battling to sell Poland
fighter jets in a deal worth $3.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The Polish decision, announced by Defense Minister Jerzy
Szmajdzinski, handed a high-profile victory to the U.S. firm in the
contest for the biggest arms sale to emerge from the 1999 expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The advanced-version F-16s
will replace Soviet-era MIGs.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the best decision for the military security of our
country," Szmajdzinski said. "It fulfills our NATO obligations. It is
the best possible decision for the safety of our pilots."</LD>
<TE>   Investments in Poland expected as part of the agreement "can
become a stimulus accelerating our economic growth and creating new
jobs," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very good deal for us ... but it is also very good for
Poland and for NATO," the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Christopher
Hill, said in an interview. "This puts Poland in the top ranks of air
forces in the world. This is a very serious airplane."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, still to be precisely detailed in a contract due to
be signed in the spring, involves the sale of 48 fighters by 2008,
plus weapons and pilot training. Lockheed Martin committed itself to
investments in Poland to help offset costs. A U.S. government-backed
loan of $3.8 billion, approved by Congress in October, further tipped
the scales to the Bethesda, Md.-based firm.</TE>
<TE>   When Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined NATO three
years ago, they agreed to modernize their air forces to defend their
airspace.</TE>
<TE>   The F-16 beat out the Gripen jet, made by a consortium of
Britain's BAE Systems and Sweden's Saab, and the Mirage 2000-5, made
by France's Dassault Aviation. Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet had
earlier also been in the competition, which began in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Dassault Aviation Chairman Charles Edelstenne, speaking Thursday
before the official announcement, told a French radio station that
the Polish decision to buy American wasn't primarily based on
economics or technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The political element was the chief element, well beyond the
quality or the price," Edelstenne said.</TE>
<TE>   Hill insisted that Poland "took the best offer." But he also
issued a statement through the U.S. Embassy that declared: "It
represents more than just an airplane. It is a fundamental choice
about strategic political and military relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Szmajdzinski rejected charges that by choosing the F-16, Poland
had somehow picked the U.S. over Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone thinks politics is of primary value here ... they will
say that it was a decision between who we are closer to, Mommy or
Daddy," Szmajdzinski said. "Poland is equally close to the U.S. and
to European countries."</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin's George R. Standridge, who headed the firm's
effort in Poland, said the decision came down to "price, technical
capabilities and offset."</TE>
<TE>   "We were the strongest across the board simply because of the
capabilities of the F-16," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The offset agreements included in the deal mean that "Poland's
industries will now become linked with some of the very strongest
companies in the U.S.," Standridge added.</TE>
<TE>   Polish officials estimated the value of the offset pledges at
between $6 billion and $10 billion, considerably more than the cost
of the jets. These investment plans and projected sales orders mainly
target Poland's ailing defense industry but also include potential
agreements in computers, energy, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, auto
parts, telecommunications and steel. Details of the deals are
expected to be settled by the end of May.</TE>
<TE>   Hungary and the Czech Republic earlier chose Gripen fighters. But
Hungary's decision was to lease, rather than buy, 14 Gripens. The
Czechs recently canceled their order for 24 of the planes in order to
free up funds for reconstruction after devastating floods hit their
country over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of jet fighter purchases has been controversial in all
three countries, which are the most prosperous of the former Soviet
bloc states.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates have argued that the new NATO members must fulfill their
commitment to defend their own airspace.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics say that far more important are pledges by the
alliance, such as increasing the mobility, professionalism and
communications capabilities of new members' armed forces. Other
opponents argue that there is no real threat for jet fighters to
defend against and that the money would be far better spent on social
needs such as health care or education.</TE>

<HD>Kenyans Vote Amid Relative Calm; Opposition Candidate Leads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The door began to close Friday on the 24-year reign of one of
Africa's last "big man" dictators, President Daniel Arap Moi, as
millions of Kenyans went to the polls in relatively peaceful
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Very preliminary results showed that opposition candidate Mwai
Kibaki, 71, a political insider who served under both of Kenya's
prior presidents, was outpacing his main rival, Uhuru Kenyatta, 42,
who had been handpicked by Moi.</LD>
<LD>   Kenyatta's defeat would be a stunning blow to Moi's Kenya African
National Union party, or KANU, which has held power for the four
decades since independence from Britain. Moi is constitutionally
barred from running again.</LD>
<TE>   Kenyan election officials say that the definitive count will take
several days.</TE>
<TE>   Parliamentary elections are expected to be closer than the
presidential race, experts say. KANU is likely to lose seats in what
has been seen as a rubber-stamp body for Moi.</TE>
<TE>   There were scattered reports of violence. In Nairobi, the capital,
opposition supporters beat a man unconscious and stripped a woman on
suspicion that they were bribing voters to support Kenyatta. And some
Kibaki backers accused election officials of strategically omitting
their names from some voter rolls.</TE>
<TE>   But in most parts of the country, the elections were orderly and
fair, according to Graham Elson, deputy chief of the European Union's
election observer delegation.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good," said Elson, one of 240 international monitors
in Kenya for Friday's vote. "Obviously, today has been a lot more
peaceful than people were forecasting."</TE>
<TE>   For many Kenyans, Friday represented a chance to rid the nation of
a corrupt government that has led the country into economic despair.
In 1997, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund suspended
aid to Kenya, citing corruption as a main reason. Despite the East
African nation's robust tourism trade and abundant natural resources,
more than half of Kenya's 30 million people live on less than $1 a
day.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been pushed so much, and we know that all that KANU can
do is eat and be rich," said Jackson Wekesa, a 29-year-old industrial
worker who voted for Kibaki's pledge of jobs, housing and improved
primary education. "We will now give the opposition five years to see
what they can do to bring us a good life."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki had been heavily favored to win, leading Kenyatta by as
many as 47 percentage points, according to a recent survey by the
Washington-based International Republican Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In his speeches, Kibaki promised a new future for Kenya and said
he would tackle government corruption, provide free education and
move the nation's stagnant economy forward.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki has tried to distance himself from Kenya's elite, but he is
among the most veteran of the five major presidential candidates,
having been vice president from 1978 to '88 and finance minister from
1969 to '82.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyatta is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, who became Kenya's first
president after leading the country's independence movement. His
campaign has benefited from his family's vast wealth and influential
friends -- including Moi.</TE>
<TE>   At one recent campaign rally, Kenyatta told the crowd, "They say
Moi will rule using me as his instrument -- but I tell you Moi is
going home after tomorrow. I will be my own man. I will not be his
man."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kenyatta touts his newcomer status -- he has never held
elected office -- his opponents attack him for being the strongman's
surrogate. Moi has acknowledged that he believes Kenyatta "is a
person who can be guided."</TE>
<TE>   As Wanjiru Muthoni, a vegetable seller and father of seven
children, stood in line outside a polling station in the Nairobi-area
town of Makadara, he said he was tired of being lied to by his
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect the change [the government] promised me," said the
55-year-old opposition supporter. "We were promised education, water,
electricity, but until now nothing has changed. I wish to see my
grandchildren get the good things they were promised."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to Friday's election, many Kenyans worried
that they would see a repetition of earlier voter fraud and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Wamjiku was so suspicious of the ruling party that she
decided to keep watch at her voting location -- a school in a village
70 miles west of Nairobi -- until the polls closed after dark.</TE>
<TE>   "I and other voters must be vigilant until the last ballot is
counted," said Wamjiku, an unemployed mother of five children. "In
1997, we were told that ballot counting could not go on because there
was no fuel in the pressure lamps.... As you can see, this time we
have brought our own lamps."</TE>
<TE>   Many opposition supporters predicted mass protests if Kenyatta won
the election.</TE>
<TE>   John Stremlau, an international relations professor at the
University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, said that a Kenyatta
victory "would be a catastrophe" and a recipe for civic unrest.</TE>

<HD>4 Israelis Killed in West Bank</HD>
<DH>Two Palestinian gunmen break into a settlement dining hall.
One is slain at the scene, the other after a swiftly mounted manhunt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A pair of Palestinian gunmen burst into the dining hall of a Jewish
settlement in the West Bank on Friday night, firing automatic weapons
and hurling grenades as seminary students gathered for a Sabbath
dinner. Four Israelis were killed and eight others were wounded,
Israeli authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Both of the gunmen were killed as well -- one during the attack on
the Otniel settlement, south of the town of Hebron, and the second
after a swiftly assembled army manhunt, in which soldiers using
helicopters and searchlights scoured the steep, rocky hills
surrounding the settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Three Israeli soldiers were injured in the firefight that broke
out when the second gunman was tracked down near the Palestinian
village of Dahariya, the army said.</LD>
<TE>   The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the
attack, which came one day after Israeli troops killed at least seven
Palestinians, including a local Islamic Jihad leader, in a series of
raids that ranged across the West Bank. Palestinians said at least
two of the dead were bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government called the settlement
attack part of a systematic terror campaign against Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an ongoing war -- it's 24 hours, around the clock," said
Raanan Gissin, a senior Sharon aide. He dismissed any connection
between Thursday's wide-ranging army raids and the attack on the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The army said there have been 21 attempts by Palestinian militants
to infiltrate Jewish settlements in the West Bank in the past month.
Last week, the rabbi of a settlement in the Gaza Strip was killed in
an ambush as he drove on a Gaza road with his wife and six children.</TE>
<TE>   For observant Jews, the start of the Sabbath is the most important
occasion of the week, often marked by singing, dancing, prayers and a
celebratory meal. Witnesses said a large group was dining together at
about 8 p.m. at the Otniel settlement when the gunmen, who apparently
entered through the kitchen, took them by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli news reports said most of the dead and injured were
students at the settlement's yeshiva, or religious seminary.</TE>
<TE>   Otniel is the site of a well-known yeshiva that combines Torah
studies with military preparation and has been a training ground for
many elite officers of the Israel Defense Forces. Ultra-Orthodox Jews
can apply for a deferment from Israel's mandatory military service,
but some opt to enlist, continue their religious studies and go on to
serve together in close-knit units.</TE>
<TE>   The Hebron area has been a frequent flashpoint for violence during
27 months of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last month, 12 soldiers
and settlement security officers were killed in a Palestinian ambush
along a pathway leading from a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron
to a disputed shrine inside the heavily Palestinian city.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the attack at Otniel, the funerals for Palestinians
killed in Thursday's raids brought impassioned calls for vengeance.
Separately, the militant group Hamas held a rally in a soccer stadium
in the Gaza Strip that drew 30,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   At it, the ailing spiritual leader of the group, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, promised that "the march of martyrs will move forward." Hamas
has carried out dozens of suicide bombings and other attacks against
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops continued a campaign of arrests of militant leaders
across the West Bank on Friday. The army said among those picked up
were a would-be suicide bomber in the Askar refugee camp near the
northern West Bank town of Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Israel credits its policy of hunting down Palestinian militant
leaders before they can stage attacks for a relatively long period of
calm inside Israel proper.</TE>
<TE>   The last major attack occurred Nov. 21 in Jerusalem, when a
suicide bomber from the West Bank town of Bethlehem boarded a bus on
the city's outskirts and killed 11 Israelis, several of them
youngsters on their way to school. Early today, a car bomb went off
in downtown Jerusalem, causing no injuries, Israel Radio reported. A
suspect in the bombing was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the aggressive Israeli campaign to arrest or kill
wanted men, with commandos swooping down on fugitives almost daily in
the middle of crowded cities, towns and refugee camps, poses a
constant danger to Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout more than two years of intense fighting, Jewish
settlements have been particular targets of armed Palestinian
attacks. Many Palestinians consider the settlements, built on land
they want for their future state, to lie at the heart of the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Israel announced tougher measures to protect the West
Bank settlements. The army said it intends to set up buffer zones
around them, inside which soldiers would be permitted to fire on any
intruders without first ascertaining whether they pose a threat.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Orders U.N. Inspectors Out at Once</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin and Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>North Korea on Friday ordered U.N. inspectors off its soil,
escalating a confrontation with the United States and its allies and
moving an important step closer to a resumption of its nuclear arms
program.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency,
North Korea said that because it intends to reopen its nuclear
facilities and restart a plutonium-reprocessing plant, the inspectors
"have no justification to stay in our country any longer."</LD>
<LD>   In Vienna, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
Mohamed ElBaradei, decried the move and insisted that the three
inspectors remain, for now, at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear
complex. Departure of the inspectors "would practically bring an end
to our ability to monitor [North Korea's] nuclear program, or assess
its nature," ElBaradei said.</LD>
<TE>   The inspectors have been in the country as part of a 1994
agreement under which North Korea eschewed a nuclear weapons program
in exchange for energy assistance.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's demand was the latest in a series of moves that have
been thrust on a Bush administration that is preoccupied with
preparations for a possible war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States has downplayed the danger of North
Korea's nuclear actions, Friday's moves appeared to get the attention
of the rest of the world, which in turn may pressure the United
States into engaging the Asian country.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult judgment for international players is how to deal
with North Korea, which is a rogue country when it comes to nuclear
proliferation but also deeply impoverished, with a civilian
population that has suffered starvation and repression at the hands
of the regime.</TE>
<TE>   There is one school of thought, favored by the Bush
administration, that rewarding those who act up sends the wrong
message. But others suggest that refusing to have any dialogue with
the country could have long-term repercussions throughout the region,
where U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan are at direct risk.</TE>
<TE>   The White House insisted again Friday that it will make no
concessions to a regime that is violating the agreement to give up
its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not negotiate in response to threats or broken
commitments," Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, said in
Crawford, Texas, near where President Bush is spending the holidays.
He described the expulsion demand as "yet another violation" by a
country that he said has been guilty of several breaches of its
commitments to halt its nuclear effort.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, U.S. officials sought to play down the potential
for a military confrontation and said they believe the solution lies
in diplomatic pressure from the United States and allies in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Washington plans to bring up the North Korea issue at a meeting of
IAEA officials in January, a U.S. official said. If the problem is
not resolved, the United States will take the matter to the U.N.
Security Council, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the expulsion of the inspectors would mean that North
Korea could draw plutonium from its long-monitored inventory of spent
fuel rods without being observed and build as many as five new
nuclear weapons, perhaps as soon as next summer. They warned that
such a step would destabilize northeast Asia and encourage other
countries around the world to cast aside their commitments not to
embark on nuclear programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This will shatter the system of treaties and restraints," said
Joseph Cirincione, director of nonproliferation studies at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea is moving to restart the nuclear program partly in
hopes of forcing U.S. concessions, and partly out of a desire to
build a nuclear arsenal to ensure the regime's security, U.S.
officials and experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The impoverished country would like an increase in aid, including
fuel oil supplies that were cut off in the fall after North Korea
disclosed it had been pursuing a secret uranium-enrichment program.
Uranium, like plutonium, can be used to build a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts said the speed of North Korea's recent steps
suggests that the Stalinist regime may be more interested in building
the arsenal than in squeezing additional concessions from the United
States. If concessions were the goal, North Korea would probably be
moving more slowly and allowing more time for pressure to build on
the United States, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Wit, a Korea specialist who was an official in the Clinton
administration, said the expulsion order marks "a big change." He
said the rapid pace of North Korea's moves makes it "more and more
likely that they're not interested in negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   He said that if the North Koreans take the next step and restart
the reprocessing plant, "we can conclude they're definitely not
interested in talking."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are three inspectors at the North Korean nuclear
complex, about 55 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang. They are a
Chinese woman, a Vietnamese woman and a Lebanese man.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, when North Korea suspended its nuclear program in
exchange for the U.S.-brokered international energy aid package, two
inspectors have been making daily inspections of the locks and
cameras that the U.N. has set up to ensure there is no activity at
the complex.</TE>
<TE>   But starting a week ago, North Korea began to cut the locks and
disable the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of ElBaradei's current approach is to give the North
Koreans a chance to back down without losing face and allow the
inspectors to continue to do their job, said an IAEA official who
asked to remain unidentified.</TE>
<TE>   Other nations joined in the criticism of North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President-elect Roh Moo Hyun, who had promised during
his campaign to treat North Korea with patience, expressed
exasperation Friday and hinted that further joint ventures could be
delayed by North Korea's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "If North Korea continues with this action which is not backed by
international opinion, it would lose support from public opinion in
the South," Roh said.</TE>
<TE>   A series of high-profile ventures between North and South Korea
appear to be endangered by the rising tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the angry exchanges over the inspectors, the U.S.-U.N.
command that oversees the 49-year-old cease-fire on the Korean
peninsula accused the North Koreans of bringing machine guns into the
DMZ six times in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   A statement from the command said South Korean soldiers saw North
Korean troops set up the machine guns during the day and take them
down at night. On Monday, North Korea refused to accept a written
inquiry from the command about the incidents.</TE>

<HD>Russia Shuts Out Peace Corps After Allegations</HD>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia said it will no longer accept Peace Corps volunteers after
alleging that the workers are poorly trained and have ties to U.S.
security services, the U.S. Embassy said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said that
his government was grateful for the Peace Corps' assistance but that
Russia's needs have changed since 1992, when the volunteers first
started going to Russia.</LD>
<LD>   "Due to the changing economic and social tasks facing our country,
we are holding consultations with the American side on how new forms
of partnership could be worked out more in line with today's needs,"
he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Russian government refused without
explanation to issue entry visas for new volunteers or to extend the
visas of 30 of the 64 Peace Corps workers already in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The head of Russia's Federal Security Service, Nikolai P.
Patrushev, suggested earlier this month that some volunteers had been
spying.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
denied Patrushev's claims and expressed regret about the decision.</TE>

<LD>This is a letter sent Friday to Mohamed ElBaradei, director general
of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, as translated
into English by North Korea's General Department of Atomic Energy:</LD>
<LD>   I am writing to inform you of the follow-up steps, now that the
freeze on our nuclear facilities has been released as was notified to
you through my letter of December 14.</LD>
<LD>   As was already informed, the Government of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea has made a decision to release the freeze of the
nuclear facilities that the DPRK [North Korea] had frozen under the
DPRK-USA Agreed Framework premised on annual delivery of 500,000
metric tons of HFO [heavy fuel oil], and immediately resume the
operation and construction of the nuclear facilities needed for
generating electricity as a countermeasure to the substantial
breakdown of the Agreed Framework by the U.S. with the halt of the
HFO delivery, followed by its designation of the DPRK as the "axis of
evil" and the target for the nuclear preemptive strike.</LD>
<TE>   Accordingly, we will resume once-suspended construction of the
atomic energy power plants and will embark on preparation to operate
the radiochemical laboratory as a preparatory step to secure safe
storage of large quantity of spent-fuel rods that would come out once
these power plants are in operation.</TE>
<TE>   It is for this sake that we will soon be prepared for the
operation of the radiochemical laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   I believe, with the releasing of the freeze on our nuclear
facilities, the mission of the IAEA inspectors in [Yongbyon] to
monitor the freeze of the nuclear facilities under the DPRK-USA
Agreed Framework, has now automatically come to its end.</TE>
<TE>   According to paragraph 3, article 1 of the DPRK-USA Agreed
Framework, the DPRK is to allow the IAEA to monitor the freeze on
graphite moderate reactors and related facilities during the period
of their freeze and render cooperation to the Agency for that
purpose. I think you are fully aware of this.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the residing of the inspectors in our country under
these circumstances goes against above article of the DPRK-USA Agreed
Framework.</TE>
<TE>   I hereby inform you of the decision of the Government of the DPRK
to let the inspectors leave the DPRK since there is no justification
for them to remain here and ask you to take necessary steps
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Yours sincerely,</TE>

<HD>Army Official Found Guilty in Timor Violence</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>An army commander was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for
failing to prevent killings in East Timor, making him the first
Indonesian official to be convicted for the violence.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Col. Soedjarwo was found guilty of failing to prevent
pro-Jakarta militias from attacking the office and home of Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo after East Timor voted to break
from Indonesia in 1999. Fifteen people were killed, and the bishop
fled to Australia.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict and sentencing followed an outcry over a series of
earlier acquittals of other Indonesian soldiers and officials.</LD>
<TE>   The prison term for Soedjarwo was half what prosecutors sought,
and he will be able to remain free while he appeals. Human rights
groups said the sentence was inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Soedjarwo headed the Indonesian military command in the East
Timorese capital, Dili, when East Timor, then an Indonesian
territory, voted for independence in a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant has been found guilty of committing grave human
rights violations," Judge Andi Samsam Nganro said. Soedjarwo, who
goes by a single name, refused to speak with reporters as he left the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Under Indonesian law, Soedjarwo could have been sentenced to
death. But the judge said the defendant "did his best to prevent some
of the violence."</TE>

<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Turkish ruling-party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that
Turkey would make no concrete promise of support for a U.S. war on
Iraq until initial results of United Nations weapons inspections were
known.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. arms experts said they interviewed a scientist possibly
linked to a clandestine Iraqi nuclear program Friday. Baghdad
officials said the inspectors also scoured a plant that makes
chemical processing equipment and one that produces liquor.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. spokesman Hiro Ueki said inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency had interviewed a metallurgist from a state
company, but the scientist, Kathim Jamil, denied any links to a
nuclear program.</LD>
<TE>   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said Jamil was a specialist in the use
of aluminum tubes used to produce missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain have raised the alarm over alleged
attempts by Iraq to buy aluminum tubes that could be used to process
uranium. Iraq denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is pressing Turkey, a close NATO ally, for a
decision on the extent of its support for any war and Friday sent two
senior officials to Ankara, the capital, to discuss the cost of a
possible conflict. Washington reportedly has asked for the use of
Turkish air bases and ports if it goes to war.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelans Await Imports as Strike Stalls Gas Industry</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Drivers formed mile-long lines at closed gas stations Friday, hoping
promised fuel supplies would arrive, as a nationwide strike aimed at
toppling President Hugo Chavez forces the world's fifth-largest oil
exporter to import gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   Motorists blocked an avenue in the western part of Caracas, the
capital, to demand gasoline, as police watched over the long lines at
service stations.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrators from both sides rallied outside the Supreme Court.
Chavez supporters urged justices to ban a proposed referendum on his
presidency as illegal. Opponents protested on behalf of merchant
marine sailors arrested for joining the strike.</LD>
<TE>   The nearly month-old strike has paralyzed Venezuela's petroleum
industry, which supplies the United States with 14% of its oil.
Exports have declined from 3 million barrels a day to a trickle,
depriving Venezuela of $50 million a day in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the fuel crunch, food supplies were running low. Brazil
announced Thursday that it would ship 520,000 barrels of gasoline to
Venezuela, while the Dominican Republic sent food as a partial
payment for oil it has received in the past. Venezuela is also
negotiating with Colombia for milk and meat, said Agriculture
Minister Efren Andrade.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian shipment of oil is not due until today. But the
government promised that some domestically produced gas would be
delivered Friday.</TE>

<HD>2 Simi Valley Detectives Honored for Role in Bust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Simi Valley police detectives have received a national award for
their work with federal agents on a two-year investigation that led
to the bust of one of the largest drug rings that made and sold an
animal tranquilizer popular on the rave scene.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Lamb and Kevin Duncan were among several law enforcement
agents honored this month at a Washington ceremony for their role in
the cross-border investigation that netted massive amounts of the
drug Ketamine, known on the streets as Special K, vitamin K and Kit
Kat.</LD>
<LD>   The two detectives, who have a combined 31 years with the Simi
Valley Police Department, received the award for investigative
excellence from the Drug Enforcement Administration.</LD>
<TE>   Their involvement in the case began more than two years ago on a
tip that someone was selling steroids and Ketamine from a Simi Valley
gym, Lamb said.</TE>
<TE>   When the detectives realized the scope of the ring -- which
involved the manufacturing of the pills in Mexico and their
distribution in the United States -- federal agents and San Diego
investigators joined the case.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lamb and Duncan remained involved, and they were on the
scene in October for a cross-border raid that netted $2 million in
cash and assets and 600,000-plus vials of the drug.</TE>

<HD>Card Rooms Lose Tribal Gambling Challenge</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A state appeals court has found that California's compacts with
Indian tribes, allowing the tribes to offer certain types of gambling
on Indian land, pass constitutional muster and don't deny card rooms,
which can be operated off Indian land, equal protection under the
law.</LD>
<LD>   The publisher of Hustler magazine, Larry Flynt, and two Los
Angeles card rooms, Hustler Casino and Normandie Casino, sued the
California Gaming Control Commission and the state attorney general
in November 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Flynt and the card rooms argued that letting certain tribes offer
certain games, including so-called banked and percentage games and
slot machines, but not letting card rooms offer the same games has
created a monopoly and put the card rooms at a competitive
disadvantage.</LD>
<TE>   The suit involved what are known as Class III games: banked games,
in which the house has a stake in a game's outcome; percentage games,
in which the house collects a share of the amount wagered; slot
machines; and other high-stakes casino-type games.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs also said that existing laws deny the card rooms
equal protection because the card rooms are prosecuted if they offer
Class III games, while Indian tribes are not. Flynt and the card
rooms asked the court to let them offer the Class III games.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st District Court of Appeal agreed with a San Francisco
County Superior Court judge who found that the state's compacts with
Indian tribes do not create an unconstitutional monopoly in violation
of equal protection. The appeals court concluded that the compacts
pass constitutional muster because they are related to "the
fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward Indians."</TE>

<HD>Residents Blame Illnesses on Lab</HD>
<DH>Several Simi Valley neighbors, who live a few miles from
the Rocketdyne facility, have either cancer or thyroid conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several longtime residents of a Simi Valley neighborhood suffer from
lung cancer or the thyroid condition Graves' disease. And they think
they might know why: contamination from a nearby rocket-testing site.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Stanford Lovett met some of his ill neighbors for the
first time Dec. 11 at a public hearing on the cleanup of the Santa
Susana Field Laboratory, where missiles were often tested during the
Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   As they traded stories, Lovett realized his neighbors' symptoms
sounded uncomfortably familiar: rapid weight loss, lack of muscle
control, heart palpitations, throbbing headaches, irritability and
severe night sweats.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe what I was hearing," said Lovett, 42, who has
lived in the Orangewood tract of Simi Valley for nearly two decades.
The neighborhood near Erringer Road and Cochran Street is about three
miles from the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Since that meeting at the Grand Vista Hotel in Simi Valley, Lovett
and his new friends have talked on the telephone several times to
figure out what to do next, if anything. They think the
rocket-testing site operated by Rocketdyne, a division of aerospace
giant Boeing, is to blame for producing soil and air pollutants that
have attacked their thyroid glands. The gland serves as a sort of
thermostat for the body.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials say they are not responsible for residents'
maladies and maintain that any chemicals and toxins generated by the
hilltop site have been contained within its 2,668 acres. State
investigators say they cannot prove the 54-year-old site was the
source of perchlorate discovered this year in 18 wells in or near
Simi Valley. Perchlorate is a highly toxic chemical used in rocket
fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, 315 people from Simi Valley and the west San
Fernando Valley filed lawsuits against Rocketdyne for allegedly
causing them to become sick or their loved ones to die.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett and his neighbors are not party to those complaints and
said they had not been aware they existed. The cases remain tied up
in federal court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Orangewood is not the closest neighborhood in Simi Valley to the
lab site. That distinction goes to Santa Susana Knolls.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett's neighbor, David Plunkett, said he is compiling a database
of everyone he meets in Simi Valley who has cancer or a
thyroid-related illness, such as Graves' disease. His wife,
Christina, 38, was diagnosed early this year with hyperthyroidism --
a condition that causes her metabolism to speed up.</TE>
<TE>   "People are popping up all over the place with Graves' disease and
thyroid problems," said Christina Plunkett, who is tall and rail
thin.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Ralph Lopez, lived in the neighborhood for eight
years before moving to Moorpark two years ago. The 54-year-old real
estate agent was diagnosed with Graves' disease nearly two years ago
after his weight plunged.</TE>
<TE>   "People said I looked good, but I was having other problems, "
Lopez said. He finally saw his doctor after waking up in the middle
of the night covered in sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Quynh Tran, 52, was diagnosed with lung cancer
in July 2001. A resident of Simi Valley for nearly 20 years, he lives
around the corner from the Plunketts. Tran, a software engineer for
Columbia Pictures, said one of his brothers-in-law, who lived nearby,
died of lung cancer 10 years ago. Neither he nor his brother-in-law
smoked, Tran said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother and another brother-in-law, both residents in the same
neighborhood, also suffered from thyroid-related conditions, which
have since stabilized, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UCLA are conducting a health study of residents
living near the Rocketdyne site under a federal initiative sponsored
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. But the
study involves only cancer rates, not thyroid disorders, said Bert
Cooper, who is overseeing the project.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Los Angeles County
health-care system in 2002 was avoiding complete collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Core programs such as emergency and trauma care remained intact as
voters endorsed a property tax increase that will yield $168 million
annually.</LD>
<LD>   But the county's reprieve came at a cost to its poorest residents,
who saw 16 health centers closed and cutbacks at dozens of private
clinics. More than 455,000 patient visits were eliminated and about
100,000 patients were affected.</LD>
<TE>   With the state struggling to close a deficit of nearly $35 billion
and the federal government insisting that it won't grant another
bailout, the county health department may face another year on a
financial precipice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like hanging around in the hut, waiting for the
avalanche to hit -- and hoping that it doesn't come," said Yolanda
Vera, senior health policy attorney with Neighborhood Legal Services
of Los Angeles County, which advocates for indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some people already feel the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Mayer, an uninsured 41-year-old diabetic, used to seek care
at the county's Azusa Health Center, less than 2 1/2 miles from his
home, until the clinic closed in September. Now he travels 11 miles
to the El Monte Health Center, or 22 miles to the Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, for doctor visits and prescription
refills.</TE>
<TE>   Walk-in patients at El Monte often wait four hours to be seen by a
doctor or nurse, said Mayer, who has had eye and foot complications
from diabetes. The wait for prescriptions also can take hours.</TE>
<TE>   "You sit there all day long," Mayer said. "You have to go real
early in the morning just to see the doctor.... If they have too many
people, they'll tell me to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Things may deteriorate. The Board of Supervisors is poised to
close the county's two hospitals without emergency rooms: High Desert
Hospital in the Antelope Valley and Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Noyola, a patient resource worker at Rancho, said she is
concerned about her job and about where disabled patients will find
care if the decision to close the hospital stands. Rancho, which is
nationally known for its innovative treatments, sees about 9,500
people each year for a variety of catastrophic injuries and ailments,
including stroke and diabetes, liver problems and spinal cord and
head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a single mother and I have to feed my child, so yes, it
worries me," said Noyola, 26, of Downey. "There has to be better ways
for them to find money than just closing this place."</TE>
<TE>   But the cuts could have been much worse. In the summer, county
officials proposed closing the emergency rooms and inpatient services
at two of the four full-service public hospitals -- Harbor-UCLA and
Olive View-UCLA medical centers -- if new money weren't found.</TE>
<TE>   County voters gave the facilities a reprieve on election day,
voting to raise property taxes to fund emergency and trauma care.</TE>
<TE>   The tax initiative, called Measure B, got more votes than any
person or issue on the county ballot. It will raise taxes by 3 cents
for every square foot of residential and commercial development, or
about $45 for a 1,500-square-foot home.</TE>
<TE>   "The most painful decisions have been at least put off
temporarily, if not permanently," said Linda Rosenstock, dean of
UCLA's School of Public Health. "For that, I think we can credit the
public's concern about their own access to emergency services."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the new property taxes, conservative projections
indicate that the county faces a health deficit of at least $210
million within three years. Discussions are continuing with state and
federal officials on how to bridge the gap.</TE>
<TE>   A top federal health official, Tom Scully, has said repeatedly the
government does not plan to bail out the county, but it does want to
help the county navigate its budget crisis without slashing patient
care.</TE>
<TE>   In the private sector as well, hospitals struggled in 2002. Tenet
Healthcare Corp. closed St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena, leaving
the city with only one full-service hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The same company announced plans to close Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital, citing financial problems. But a coalition of community
activists fought Tenet's decision. And the state attorney general's
office, which oversees the sale of nonprofit hospitals to for-profit
companies, successfully petitioned a Superior Court judge to halt the
closing temporarily because Tenet had not lived up to the terms of
its purchase deal. To date, the hospital remains open.</TE>
<TE>   Financial troubles extended to three San Fernando Valley hospitals
whose operators filed for bankruptcy protection recently after a
lender didn't deliver funding. Granada Hills Community Hospital,
Pacifica Hospital of the Valley and Pine Grove Hospital remain open
as they reorganize their debts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to budget problems, many hospitals had other
challenges: preparing for a possible bioterrorism attack, alleviating
emergency room congestion and implementing state regulations that set
minimum ratios of nurses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses unions, appealing to members' dismay over cutbacks and
tight staffing, made huge gains in organizing drives in Southern
California. Earlier this month, the California Nurses Assn. won its
campaign to organize 1,500 registered nurses at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, the largest private hospital in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital is challenging the results.</TE>
<TE>   The same union also won its first contract this month for 1,300
nurses at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Though possibly worst in Los Angeles County, the looming financial
crisis in health care was a major theme statewide.</TE>
<TE>   To lighten demand for services, Gov. Gray Davis in May proposed
raising the income limit for families to qualify for Medi-Cal,
increasing required paperwork, and cutting dental, chiropractic and
other so-called optional benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature rejected those cuts, but did allow the governor to
delay the expansion of the much-touted Healthy Families program to
include working poor parents.</TE>
<TE>   The state's budget problems worsened though, and the governor has
proposed many of the same cuts again.</TE>
<TE>   State officials estimate that about 500,000 people would be pared
from the Medi-Cal rolls -- either for failing to fill out paperwork
or for not meeting new income limits.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's latest proposals would pare $167.5 million from the
general fund's $11-billion budget for Medi-Cal, which covers 6.4
million indigent, elderly and disabled adults and children.</TE>
<TE>   Health advocate Anthony Wright described the cuts as a "full
assault on the health-care system."</TE>

<HD>George Roy Hill, 81; Gifted Storyteller Directed 'The
Sting,' 'Butch Cassidy'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Roy Hill, who directed Paul Newman and Robert Redford in two
of their biggest hits -- "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and
"The Sting" -- died Friday in his New York City apartment. He was 81,
and had been battling Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Hill, who won an Academy Award for directing "The Sting," was best
known as a gifted light-comedy director with a nice touch for romance
in films that often reflected an ironic, bittersweet view of life.</LD>
<LD>   A master storyteller, Hill worked in a variety of genres,
including musicals and historic epics.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 14 films he directed from 1962 to 1988 are "Period of
Adjustment," "The World of Henry Orient," "Hawaii," "Thoroughly
Modern Millie," "Slaughterhouse-Five," "The Great Waldo Pepper,"
"Slap Shot," "A Little Romance," "The World According to Garp" and
"The Little Drummer Girl."</TE>
<TE>   "He made a lot of charming movies," said Time magazine film critic
and film historian Richard Schickel. "His best vein was a kind of
cheeky comedy with a little bit of undertone of some seriousness to
it. I think that's what he did best and that's what he'll be
remembered for."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, by the mid-1970s, Hill had become the first director to
ever have two pictures on Variety's list of All-Time Top 10 Movie Box
Office Hits: "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (No. 10) and "The
Sting" (No. 4), which besides winning him an Academy Award for best
director also won the best picture Oscar. (Both films have since
fallen from the list.)</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of those two successes, Hill was credited by some for
being in the vanguard of an industry trend to entertain audiences and
return to straightforward storytelling after a period during which
films emphasized atmosphere and symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   "George Roy Hill's pictures," director Peter Bogdanovich said at
the time, "have been an important influence in showing the industry
that what the public wants is a good story."</TE>
<TE>   Director Arthur Hiller said of Hill's films: "Each story was told
in the way it should be told. He wasn't trying to be stylized; he
stylized it in its best storytelling manner."</TE>
<TE>   William Goldman, who wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for "Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" as well as the script for "The Great
Waldo Pepper," said Hill "was the best director I ever worked with or
ever will work with."</TE>
<TE>   "He was really smart and really tough," Goldman said. "He was a
Marine pilot in two wars and didn't take [guff] from anybody. George
was cranky and bright and could be very funny, and he was black Irish
and all that that entails."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hill's success as a filmmaker, the general public knew
little about the former Yale University music major who played Bach
on the piano for an hour each morning and flew an open-cockpit
biplane built in 1930. Hill deliberately shunned publicity and rarely
gave interviews to promote his pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "I find publicity distasteful and I don't think it does the
picture any good to focus on the director," he said in an interview
in Edward Shores' 1983 book "George Roy Hill," an examination of
Hill's films.</TE>
<TE>   "Lately it's come around so that the director is more of a star
than he was [in the past], but I've never wanted that," Hill said. "I
feel that I can accomplish more if I have a low [public] profile. My
profile in the business is just fine."</TE>
<TE>   "George didn't like publicity, so he's really not mentioned the
way he should be," said production designer Henry Bumstead, who
worked with Hill on eight pictures and won an Oscar for his
production design on "The Sting."</TE>
<TE>   "But if you look at George's body of work, it's unbelievable the
variety of films he did, from 'Slap Shot' to 'The World According to
Garp.' He was a fantastic director."</TE>
<TE>   Hill was born on Dec. 20, 1921, in Minneapolis. His mother's uncle
founded the Minneapolis Tribune, which remained in the family after
the uncle died. Hill's father, who was secretary of the American
Automobile Assn. in Minneapolis, died when Hill was 9.</TE>
<TE>   While growing up, Hill developed early interests in classical
music and aviation. Fascinated by the era's barnstorming pilots, a
period he would tap for "The Great Waldo Pepper," Hill hung out at
the local airport and obtained a pilot's license when he was 17.</TE>
<TE>   Hill also developed an early interest in acting, appearing in
student productions at Blake Country Day School, a prep school in
Hopkins, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, he majored in music at Yale. A baritone, he
became a member of the university Glee Club and the Whiffenpoofs, but
he eventually realized that he didn't have much talent as a singer.
He also joined the Dramatic Society, becoming president and appearing
in campus musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days after graduating with a bachelor's degree in music in
1942, Hill joined the Navy. After flight school, he transferred to
the Marines and piloted transport planes in the South Pacific.
Following the war, he worked briefly as a cub reporter on a family
newspaper in Texas, then used the GI Bill to attend Trinity College
in Dublin, Ireland, where he earned a bachelor's degree in
literature.</TE>
<TE>   While in Dublin, Hill acted in productions staged by
poet-dramatist Austin Clarke at the Abbey Theatre, and continued
acting after returning to America in 1949. He had roles in plays put
on by Cyril Cusack's repertory company in New York City, and toured
with Margaret Webster's Shakespearean company, where he met actress
Louisa Horton, whom he married in 1951. They later divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Hill landed a steady job on the radio soap opera "John's Other
Wife," but the Korean War curtailed his acting career. Called back
into active duty, he spent 18 months at the Marine Corps jet-pilot
training center at Cherry Point, N.C., where he had time to
reevaluate his feelings about acting.</TE>
<TE>   What had been enjoyable at Yale was now "too painful. I didn't
like to expose myself or summon up emotions I didn't have," Hill once
said. It got to the point, he said, "where I would break into a sweat
and get sick to my stomach before going on stage."</TE>
<TE>   The service also gave Hill time to write. He already had written
two unpublished autobiographical novels, and, by the time he was
discharged in 1953, had sold three scripts to Kraft Television
Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, who continued to write, quickly rose from assistant director
to director on various dramatic shows, including "Playhouse 90."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next five years, he directed more than 50 live dramas,
including "The Helen Morgan Story," the original "Judgment at
Nuremburg" and "A Night to Remember" (about the sinking of the
Titanic).</TE>
<TE>   "When I went out to Hollywood," Hill said, "I was probably more
expert at editing than many who had been in Hollywood for years. My
whole thought process of seeing a film before I ever got on the set
developed from working for television. Live television was a
tremendous training ground for a director."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time he was making his mark in television, Hill became
a respected Broadway director. His first production, Ketti Fring's
adaptation of Thomas Wolfe's novel "Look Homeward, Angel" in 1957,
won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize.</TE>
<TE>   After directing Tennessee Williams' "Period of Adjustment" on
Broadway, Hill began his film career by directing the 1962 film
version of Williams' play about young newlyweds. He followed that up
with the 1963 film version of "Toys in the Attic," an adaptation of
Lillian Hellman's play.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he started work on "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid" in 1968, Hill also had directed Peter Sellers in "The World of
Henry Orient" and Julie Andrews in the epic "Hawaii" and in
"Thoroughly Modern Millie."</TE>
<TE>   "Butch Cassidy" propelled Hill into the top ranks of Hollywood
directors. But no one involved with the film anticipated the
light-hearted western would be the runaway hit it became when it was
released in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the country's most influential film critics found much to
pan in the nostalgic tale of two outdated outlaws running away from a
relentless super-posse at the end of the western era.</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker's Pauline Kael called it "unfocused and
unrealized," a "glorified vacuum." Stanley Kauffmann in the New
Republic scoffed, "Hill's direction, like the writing, is imitative
of everything that's 'in.' " And the New York Times' Vincent Canby
said the outlaws' "decline and fall was the sort of alternately
absurd and dreamy saga that might have been fantasized by Truffaut's
Jules and Jim and Catherine -- before they grew up."</TE>
<TE>   But audiences fell in love with the delightful and stylishly made
film, which earned Oscars for Conrad Hall's cinematography, Burt
Bacharach's original score and Bacharach and Hal David's song
("Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"), as well as Goldman's original
screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   The film was also notable for making a superstar out of Redford.</TE>
<TE>   The studio, 20th Century Fox, originally did not want Redford for
the role of Sundance opposite Newman's Butch, preferring instead to
cast a similarly big star such as Marlon Brando or Warren Beatty.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Redford said in an interview that appeared on a 25th
anniversary laser disc edition of the film, "George is the one that
went to the mat" for him.</TE>
<TE>   "This unquestionably was the film that put me in a new place,"
Redford said. "I could no longer live my life the way I had been
living, normally."</TE>
<TE>   Redford credited Hill for being "the one that really gave [the
film] a kind of dimension and breadth by opening it up. It wasn't
quite so much jokes back and forth. He created space for behavior and
character development that I think is what really gave the film that
extra lift."</TE>
<TE>   As the director, Hill had to walk a fine line between the film's
comedy and drama. Goldman recalled getting a call from Hill after he
attended a sneak preview of "Butch Cassidy" in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was in despair because they laughed at it," Goldman
said. "He said he thought it was too funny. He went through [the
film], taking out laughs because his feeling was -- and he was quite
right -- if it was too funny you wouldn't be ready for the sad stuff
that came at the end. So he did a phenomenal job of directing the
script."</TE>
<TE>   In their interviews for the special anniversary edition of the
film, Newman and Redford gave high praise to Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "He is truly a director in the best sense," Newman said. "When
you're cookin', he leaves you alone. When you get in trouble, which
is where most directors falter, he's the guy that comes in and points
you in the right direction and that, believe me, is very unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Said Redford: "First of all, he was just perverse enough to make
it an interesting experience. I appreciated that. He was wily and
wicked and full of surprises and enjoyed being surprised back, so
that made it lively.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that, George has such discipline for the work. He knew
exactly what he wanted to do. He was totally prepared. He has no fat
in his films, and I learned a lot from that. He really understands
the importance of story."</TE>
<TE>   Hill, the Yale music major, also understood the importance of
music. That was particularly evident on "Butch Cassidy."</TE>
<TE>   "Burt Bacharach scored the film and we made a deliberate decision
to go with a semi-modern sound despite that we were playing in
period," Hill said in his narration for a behind-the-scenes
documentary of "Butch Cassidy" that he donated to Yale.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture was designed for a contemporary feel," Hill said.
"The characters are modern rather than traditional in approach and
temperament, and [Goldman's] dialogue, while it isn't actually
anachronistic, has a very contemporary rhythm and sound to it and we
didn't want a traditional western score."</TE>
<TE>   The film's most famous musical sequence -- Newman clowning on a
bicycle for Katharine Ross -- resulted in Bacharach and David writing
"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" to accompany it.</TE>
<TE>   "George wanted a song like the Gershwin tune 'Bidin' My Time,' "
Goldman said. "And if you play 'Bidin' My Time' and play 'Raindrops,'
they're the same kind of loping, 'we're going along and having fun'
song."</TE>
<TE>   When a 20th Century Fox executive protested that the musical
bicycle sequence had nothing to do with the plot, Hill agreed, but
said, "The emotion is right."</TE>
<TE>   "He was the best friend that anyone could have: friend, mentor,
enemy," Newman said in a statement Friday reported by Associated
Press. "He gave everyone a hell of a ride. Himself included."</TE>
<TE>   Hill is survived by two sons, George Roy Hill III of Roslyn, N.Y.,
and John Andrew Steele Hill of Ardsley, N.Y; two daughters, Frances
Breckinridge Phipps of Dumont, N.J., and Owens Hill of Los Angeles;
and 12 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at a later date.</TE>

<HD>Lack of Progress on Hotel Tests Neighbors' Patience</HD>
<DH>Ian Schrager's vow to rebuild the landmark sounds hollow to
some residents fed up with it being an eyesore. He faults the
economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTECITO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For almost a year now, the residents of this wealthy coastal
community have been trying to resolve their most troublesome local
problem with diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   But now, they say, the time for patience may be coming to an end.
The new year could bring a new round of open hostility.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is the lack of any tangible progress in the
long-promised renovation of the Miramar Hotel, the blue-roofed
landmark just off U.S. 101 that long symbolized Montecito's casual
chic.</LD>
<TE>   New York hotelier Ian Schrager bought the Miramar in 1998, then
started leveling it and tearing up its landscape. He was talking then
about transforming the property into a seaside resort with an English
cottage feel.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, however, everything came to a stop. Schrager
had money problems. And Montecito wound up with a giant mudhole and a
half-wrecked hotel, instead of the classy renovation that had been
promised.</TE>
<TE>   There was a showdown last February, when Schrager, once the owner
of New York's Studio 54 and a convicted tax cheat, came to town to
essentially apologize to Montecito's moneyed and politically
connected residents.</TE>
<TE>   Pleading for patience, he told a crowd of about 100 angry
residents that he hoped he could restart work in a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "I would ask you to believe a little bit longer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Pannkuk, president of the Montecito Assn., one of the
community's institutional watchdogs, said she has been trying to do
that ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Schrager did deliver on some minor promises, Pannkuk said. A
security guard was hired to patrol the abandoned grounds and keep
transients away. A fence was erected to block the view. And the
ugliest partly destroyed building visible to the public was torn
down.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Schrager's top aide, Michael Overington, began making
himself much more accessible to local residents when they called for
progress reports.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been very responsive on the little things," Pannkuk
said.</TE>
<TE>   In July, still citing funding problems, Schrager convinced both
the Montecito Assn. and Santa Barbara County officials to go along
with a proposal allowing him to rebuild the hotel in phases, instead
of all at once.</TE>
<TE>   That would help him obtain the money he needed to finally get
construction underway again, Schrager said. Pannkuk's memory is that
Overington also said then that it would probably take four or five
months to get things moving.</TE>
<TE>   A former contract negotiator for the U.S. Defense Department,
Pannkuk was moved to pledge in return that she would avoid any strong
criticisms of Schrager until Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I promised I would give them until then," she said last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The flip side is we still have a big hole in the ground. I think
that meeting back in February bought him a year, but that year is
coming to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara County Supervisor Naomi Schwartz has also tried
diplomacy, but recent letters between her and Schrager show an
increasing sense of frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I continue to be approached by constituents with concerns about
the incomplete status of the Miramar Hotel renovation project,"
Schwartz wrote Oct. 18. "The community is still waiting. When may we
expect construction to begin?"</TE>
<TE>   In response, Schrager avoided giving any specific timetable.</TE>
<TE>   Stating that the economy has grown worse since his initial
promises were made, he wrote back that "we are confident that we will
secure financing if we are both persistent and patient."</TE>
<TE>   And with that, the supervisor's own patience appeared to be
fading.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed that your response was not more promising,"
she wrote back in November. "I do think that it is important for you
to provide another update to the community that incorporates more
specifics and a tentative schedule to resume work on this project."</TE>
<TE>   Schrager's response was that it is impossible to predict anything
in the current economy, said John Davies, a Santa Barbara public
relations executive.</TE>
<TE>   "The impatience is well-appreciated," he said, "but running out of
patience is not going to help the situation. To try to predict any
time frame now would be a huge error.</TE>
<TE>   "Ian Schrager will get this done, but it's simply going to take
more time."</TE>

<HD>Pregnant Woman Disappears While Walking Her Dog</HD>
<DH>FBI, police, volunteers by the hundreds hunt for the
27-year-old Modesto mother-to-be. She was last seen in a nearby park
Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of volunteers joined police and FBI agents on Friday in
combing parks and neighborhoods for a woman who disappeared Christmas
Eve day while walking her dog.</LD>
<LD>   But despite four days of horse, dog, raft and helicopter patrols,
Laci Denise Peterson remained missing.</LD>
<LD>   Peterson, 27, who is eight months pregnant, left her Modesto home
Tuesday morning to walk her golden retriever. When her husband,
Scott, returned that evening from a Bay Area fishing trip, she was
gone.</LD>
<TE>   The dog, with its leather leash still attached, was in the
backyard, where a neighbor had put it after finding it wandering the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's purse was in the house, and there was no sign of a
disturbance.</TE>
<TE>   She was last seen in a neighborhood park about 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Family members began searching the park and called police, who
began an extensive search of their own.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the FBI got involved, helping local authorities to
seal off the Peterson home and seizing vehicles owned by Peterson and
her husband, who police said was staying with friends. A family
spokesman said that search was routine.</TE>
<TE>   Police and FBI agents also questioned homeless people in the park
where she was last seen and searched her computer.</TE>
<TE>   Her family pleaded on national television for her return.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever has her could have some compassion," said Brent Rocha,
Peterson's brother. "She's a human being. She's pregnant. She needs
to take care of her baby. She's a wife, a daughter, a sister. Please
return her."</TE>
<TE>   Police do not think Peterson decided to leave without contacting
her family.</TE>
<TE>   "That is completely out of character for her," said Police Det. Al
Brocchini.</TE>
<TE>   Family members and friends have offered a $125,000 reward for
information leading to her safe return.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous person also established a $25,000 reward through the
Carole Sund-Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation.</TE>

<HD>William Orr, 85; Had Hit TV Shows in 1950s, '60s for Warner
Bros.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William T. Orr, the Warner Bros. executive who launched the movie
studio's entry into television production in the mid-1950s and for
nearly a decade presided over a string of hit shows that included
"Cheyenne," "Maverick" and "77 Sunset Strip," has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Orr, a former actor who became studio head Jack L. Warner's
executive assistant in the mid-1940s, died of natural causes
Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   As the head of Warner Bros. Television from 1955 to 1963, Orr
oversaw 24 shows, including "The Roaring Twenties," "No Time for
Sergeants," "Colt 45," "Lawman" and a spate of private-eye shows that
followed in the wake of the popular "77 Sunset Strip" -- "Hawaiian
Eye," "Bourbon Street Beat" and "Surfside Six."</LD>
<TE>   The lineup of Warner Bros.-produced series contributed greatly to
the emerging success of ABC-TV, then the lowest-ranked network.</TE>
<TE>   The shows also turned the studio's stable of young TV actors into
household names: James Garner, Clint Walker, Ty Harden, Connie
Stevens, Robert Conrad, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Edd "Kookie" Byrnes,
Will Hutchins, Dorothy Provine and Roger Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the one who made it all happen," said Smith, who had been
signed to a studio contract by Orr to appear in the movie "Auntie
Mame" and, at 22, found himself cast as detective Jeff Spencer in "77
Sunset Strip," co-starring with Zimbalist.</TE>
<TE>   "For that period, there was nobody better than Bill Orr," Smith
told The Times on Friday. "He was fair in his treatment with his
stars."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, TV viewers were accustomed to seeing the credit "Wm.
T. Orr, Executive in Charge of Production" at the end of each Warner
Bros. show, but few were aware of his impact on the young medium.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Orr is like [NBC's] Pat Weaver and [ABC's] Roone Arledge
who, if you asked the average person who these people were, most
Americans couldn't tell you, yet they so much impacted how television
ultimately looked and how it looks to this day," said Robert
Thompson, professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse
University.</TE>
<TE>   For Orr and Warner Bros., it began in 1955 with "Warner Bros.
Presents," the umbrella title for three rotating series produced for
ABC and based on old Warner movies: "Casablanca," "Kings Row" and a
little-known Western called "Cheyenne."</TE>
<TE>   "Casablanca" and "King's Road" flopped, but "Cheyenne," starring
Clint Walker as a post-Civil War adventurer in the West, was a hit
and spent eight years on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Simon, curator of television at the Museum of Television and
Radio in New York City, credits Orr with implementing a production
process for filming weekly television series.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a year or so to get down the budget and organization to
adapt Warner Bros. film techniques to television, and Orr was pivotal
in doing that," Simon said, adding that Orr also was "pivotal in
finding new stars for television."</TE>
<TE>   "His career signaled how important television would become in the
studio system," said Simon. "Television began as a step-child, but
because of Orr, it became equal with film in creating revenue and
jobs for the studio."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a businessman, Orr was born in New York City and
attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H. At 18, after his
parents divorced, Orr moved to Los Angeles with his mother and
younger sister.</TE>
<TE>   Handsome and athletic, he did some modeling and began taking
acting classes. He had his first big break with "Meet the People," a
long-running stage revue in Los Angeles hosted by Hollywood columnist
Louella Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   The show led to his being offered a $300-a-week acting contract at
Warner Bros. Although he made a few shorts at Warner, he was more
often lent out to other studios. He appeared in nearly 20 movies
between 1938 and 1943.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served as an officer in the First Motion
Picture Unit of the Army Air Forces at Hal Roach Studios in Culver
City.</TE>
<TE>   Joining other actors including Ronald Reagan, William Holden and
Alan Ladd, Orr appeared in military training films.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Friday, former First Lady Nancy Reagan said,
"Ronnie often spoke of the many projects they worked on together
while in the Army and of their time at Fort Roach."</TE>
<TE>   Orr became famous -- or more accurately infamous -- for one
training film he appeared in -- "Three Cadets" -- which warned GIs
about the dangers of untreated venereal disease.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the pilot who treated himself with his own remedy instead
of going to the base doctor," said his son Gregory Orr, a documentary
filmmaker. "As a result, he crashed his plane."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the war in 1945, Orr married Jack Warner's
stepdaughter, Joy Page, an actress who played the young Bulgarian
woman in "Casablanca."</TE>
<TE>   About a year later, Warner offered his son-in-law a job as his
assistant, which had Hollywood wags joking that "the son-in-law also
rises."</TE>
<TE>   Orr, who became heavily involved in casting at Warner before
becoming head of television production, was put in charge of
theatrical as well as television production at the studio in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   He left Warner Bros. in 1965 to become an independent producer,
and retired in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Although Orr and his wife divorced after 25 years of marriage,
they remained close and they spent the last couple of years living
together.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Orr is survived by a daughter, Diane Orr,
and a sister, Maury DeMots, both of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. today at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to
the Motion Picture &amp; Television Hospital in Woodland Hills.</TE>

<CX>   Orr obituary -- The obituary of former Warner Bros. executive William
T. Orr in the California section on Dec. 28 incorrectly stated that
he launched the studio's entry into television production. In fact,
Gary Stevens was named as the first head of Warner Bros. Television,
in April 1955. Stevens, however, was replaced four months later by
Orr, who held the position until 1963.</CX>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The second-ranking bishop in the Church of England declared
conditional support for war against Iraq to battle the "forces of
evil and wickedness," breaking ranks with the new archbishop of
Canterbury.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop of York David Hope, in a television interview, said he
believed military action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
regime could be justified "in the very last resort."</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is on record opposing
military action in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a very strong, almost ingrained, antipathy toward war,"
Hope said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "I have to recognize that human nature can be so
fallen and dark -- there are forces of evil and wickedness -- and
that does have to be addressed. I would say that in the very last
resort, it may be possible that we have to resort to war."</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church Scandal Takes Toll on Attendance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic Church has suffered some loss of regular
attendance at Mass since the outbreak of this year's sex scandals,
according to a new survey. A second survey shows Latinos continuing
to move away from the church.</LD>
<LD>   A poll released this week by the Gallup Organization shows that
attendance at Mass has dropped slightly this year. The number of
Catholics who said they had attended services in the last week fell
to 41%, compared with 46% for the same period in 2001, the poll
showed.</LD>
<LD>   The rate of Catholic Church attendance is now lower than that for
Protestants, who have lagged behind Catholics in their worship rate
in the decades since Gallup has been measuring attendance. The latest
poll found 47% of Protestants said they went to church in the last
week.</LD>
<TE>   Gallup also found that four in 10 Catholics were less likely to
donate to the church because of the clerics' sex abuse crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The survey of slightly more than 1,000 adults was conducted Dec. 9
and Dec. 10, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 7 percentage
points.</TE>
<TE>   The second study, an outgrowth of last year's American Religious
Identification Survey, found the percentage of U.S. Latinos who are
Catholic had dropped from 66% in 1990 to 57% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of Latinos with "no religion" doubled from 6% to
13% over the same period while the number of Latino Protestants --
about a quarter of the overall Latino population -- has remained
stable.</TE>
<TE>   Ariela Keysar, the study's lead author, said the data disprove the
widespread notion that Latinos are leaving the Catholic Church for
Pentecostal and other Protestant churches.</TE>
<TE>   The study, coordinated by researchers at the City University of
New York, surveyed 50,281 people in the continental United States.</TE>

<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The country's Jewish community has installed Isak Haleva as chief
rabbi, a 550-year-old post created when the Ottomans conquered
Istanbul.</LD>
<LD>   Haleva, 62, has been acting chief rabbi and leader of the
25,000-member Jewish community since his election to the post in
October.</LD>
<LD>   In an elaborate ceremony in Istanbul's main synagogue, Haleva was
presented with a white, fringed prayer shawl by Israel's chief rabbi,
Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron.</LD>
<TE>   A Turkish rabbi then draped a chain holding two golden tablets
inscribed with the Ten Commandments around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   The chain and the tablets are a symbol of the chief rabbi's
office.</TE>

<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>A state board has rejected a request from evangelical Christians to
flag biology textbooks with a statement that evolution is a theory,
not a fact.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education had
approved the disclaimer proposal earlier, but the full board rejected
the panel's recommendation by a 7-3 vote Dec. 12. Had the disclaimer
been approved, it would have made Louisiana the only state besides
Alabama with such a provision.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not prepared to go back to the Dark Ages," said Paul
Pastorek, the board's president, who voted against the disclaimer.</LD>
<TE>   Some religious fundamentalists and others object to the teaching
of evolution, saying that it contradicts the biblical account of
creation.</TE>

<HD>Monastic Order Steps In for Dwindling Priests</HD>
<DH>Norbertine clerics have taken over running a Costa Mesa
parish and set up a mini-monastery within the church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until a few months ago, the parishioners at St. John the Baptist
Church in Costa Mesa were used to seeing a lone harried cleric
conducting daily Mass. The attendance of only one priest at services
has become a fact of life in most Catholic parishes these days, the
reality born of the dwindling of numbers to shepherd a multiplying
flock.</LD>
<LD>   But now, the worshippers at St. John the Baptist say they get a
daily spiritual jolt at the sight of five Norbertine priests in white
robes standing shoulder to shoulder at morning and evening services.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives everyone a feeling that we're all here, and we're all
together," said Hugh Gaffney, a 15-year parishioner who attends daily
Mass. "The parish priests -- they just don't have enough of them."</LD>
<TE>   This summer, the Norbertine clerics from St. Michael's Abbey in
Silverado Canyon in south Orange County took over running the
3,000-family Costa Mesa parish and set up a mini-monastery within the
church. The move was the culmination of a six-year project that
trained the Norbertines to work in parishes, helping the Diocese of
Orange with its shortage of priests and giving the priests from the
abbey an additional line of work.</TE>
<TE>   A key element of the deal was a provision for the Norbertines to
continue leading a communal life, a hallmark of the order that was
founded in the 12th century by St. Norbert, a German who gave up his
wealth for life as a poor priest following a strict regimen of prayer
and penance. Norbert started the monastic order as a reform of the
lax clerical standards of his day, wanting to return priests to the
practices that Augustine had developed in the 4th century. There are
three other Norbertine communities in the United States and 33 in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's reassuring to the parishioners that we're a
community functioning as one," said Father Martin Benzoni, the
parish's new pastor. "And it's a bright future for us. One of the
responsibilities we have is showing people that it's a good thing to
have Norbertines in their parish."</TE>
<TE>   The clerics are the latest group of priests from religious orders
to run one of the 55 parishes in Orange County. The Augustian
Fathers, Augustinian Recollects and Servite Fathers and Brothers run
a total of six parishes. And in an era when the diocese is forced to
run some churches with a single priest, any new assistance is
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We could use their help," Bishop Tod D. Brown said. "And I fully
expect them to do a wonderful job."</TE>
<TE>   To create enough critical mass to develop a small but healthy
monastic community at St. John the Baptist, the diocese agreed to
assign four priests to the parish, one more than had previously
worked there. The abbey also sent a fifth cleric, who teaches at
nearby Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, to live with his spiritual
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The Norbertines, whose tradition in Europe includes work in
churches, are better known in the U.S. for their teaching and rigid
monastic life. Before moving into their new role, the priests spent
about five years training under some of the most respected pastors in
parishes throughout Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the priests moved into the St. John the Baptist rectory,
which they have remodeled to enhance communal living. One private
study was turned into an oratory or prayer room, complete with a
custom-made walnut altar. Another large room was converted into a
meeting space, with a game table and chairs, couches, TV and shelves
full of videos and books.</TE>
<TE>   Regimented Life</TE>
<TE>   Daily life for the Norbertines is much more regimented than the
schedule of most parish priests, beginning with mandatory morning
prayers at 5:45 a.m. The priests are also expected to attend noon and
evening prayers, have dinner six nights a week in the rectory dining
room and participate in a final late night prayer service before bed.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the priests hope to add other elements of their
monastic life to the parish, including their tradition of Gregorian
chant.</TE>
<TE>   It's a communal life that other parish priests are trying to
emulate, at least in part in response to the sexual abuse scandal
that has hit their ranks. They believe isolation, usually a result of
busy schedules, can lead to weakened spirituality, secret lives and
no peer accountability.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge to us to live more closely with each other,"
said Steve Sallot, pastor of St. Edward Church in Dana Point who now
organizes priestly get-togethers. "We need to be more responsible to
each other and for each other."</TE>
<TE>   For many parishioners at St. John the Baptist, the Norbertines'
new assignment -- which will continue indefinitely -- means stability
for a church whose former pastor was put on leave last year after the
surfacing of a 21-year-old allegation of molestation.</TE>
<TE>   "The place will remain intact," Gaffney said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott Eugene Hayes, who supervises 44 priests and another 19 men
in training to become priests, said he's been pleased with the
experiment so far.</TE>
<TE>   "In each case with each priest we gave the diocese, I said, 'This
is a great sacrifice for us because these are valuable men,' " Hayes
said. "But it was a sacrifice that we saw following God's will."</TE>

<LD>A sheriff's deputy has been fired for having sex with an intoxicated
woman while he was investigating her for an alleged assault, court
records show.</LD>
<LD>   The county Sheriff's Department called the dismissal a personnel
matter, and was unavailable for comment Friday. The district
attorney's office said that it had decided against charging Deputy
Antonio Lee Smith with rape.</LD>
<LD>   The deputy was fired July 24 after he was sent to a 37-year-old
woman's home on Dec. 26, 2001. The woman had been accused of assault,
and Smith admitted that, at the home, he engaged in several sexual
acts with the suspect.</LD>

<LD>Turtle Bay Exploration Park is falling short of its attendance goal,

<LD>   The 300-acre park is the centerpiece of Redding's ambitious effort
to become a destination for motorists on Interstate 5 in the
northernmost end of the hot Sacramento Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Park officials adjusted this year's attendance estimate from
200,000 to 115,000 after disappointing attendance that park officials
blame, in part, on construction delays that forced the park to open

<LD>Some residents who have been getting priced out of one of the most
expensive real estate markets in the country have been turning to a
decades-old housing practice that lets them own their own homes.</LD>
<LD>   Community land trusts have boomed in the San Francisco Bay Area
and across the nation. The Northern California Land Trust in Berkeley
has developed 16 projects with 84 housing units over the last decade
in Berkeley, Oakland, Richmond and San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The land trusts buy land and fix the old homes that are there, or
build new ones. They then sell the homes, typically to low-income
buyers, but keep the land to prevent property costs from
skyrocketing.</LD>

<LD>Police are investigating a third instance of racist graffiti on signs
and buildings around the city's fraternity house district.</LD>
<LD>   So far, detectives don't know who is spray-painting the hate
symbols around the campus community and have no leads or witnesses to
the crimes, said police Sgt. Steve Odom.</LD>
<LD>   Police discovered a swastika and Celtic cross, associated with the
Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, on an apartment building near campus.
The words "White Power" were beside the symbols.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the same symbols appeared on a garage four
blocks away, the same street where a sign for an African American
student cooperative was covered with similar racist graffiti.</TE>

<HD>Woebegone Town Wins Bid for Survival on EBay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly and Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BRIDGEVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Is it a California dream or a buyer's nightmare?</LD>
<LD>   A Southland businessman offered the high bid of $1.77 million
Friday for Bridgeville, a hard-luck hamlet deep in the foggy forests
of Humboldt County, marking the first time an entire town has gone
for sale on EBay.</LD>
<LD>   The seller and mystery buyer -- who has asked to remain anonymous
for now -- must still enter into a contract, leaving both parties
plenty of chances to back out.</LD>
<TE>   "He wants to renovate the entire town," said a delighted Elizabeth
Lapple, who owns Bridgeville with her brother, Edward. "Can he still
back out? Sure. Is it likely? No way."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, the novel online auction triggered plenty of
buzz: Offers flew in from around the globe. So did harebrained
schemes, like the one from the Texan to turn the town into a brothel.
Local real estate agents scoffed as bids on the 82 acres spiraled to
more than double the asking price. NBC's "Today" show went live at
4:30 a.m. from the little town's pale-blue post office -- its only
going concern. And in a driving rain, the 20 or so residents left in
this has-been timber town started dreaming of better days.</TE>
<TE>   There is no grocery store, no restaurant, no saloon, no library
and no gas station. Houses, some utterly wrecked, others badly
battered, are lined up in sad formation on muddy hillsides, while
others lie boarded up alongside the burbling Van Duzen River.</TE>
<TE>   Pitched on EBay as a promising would-be resort, escape or tax
shelter, the town also includes a cemetery, historic bridge and
backhoe -- for all the many fix-it tasks that lie ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to make it a town again or a trailer park, people
here will be jumping up and down to help," said Jessie Wheeler, 59,
whose grandparents George Henry and Jessie Helen Cox bought the town
in 1912. "This used to be a Norman Rockwell town. We have hit bottom,
and there is nowhere to go but up."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler's one hope is that the townspeople at least be considered
for a spot in the "new" Bridgeville, but even she concedes that "if
they tore down the houses and ran cattle in here, it would be
better."</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Adams, 52, who wandered into the post office Friday to get
her mail, agreed: "Bridgeville needs some new money, some new
infusion of energy .... Things can't get any worse."</TE>
<TE>   Located 260 miles north of San Francisco on a narrow highway that
winds through the redwoods, the picturesque enclave is so hard-up
that few residents have jobs. The property stagnated for four years
on the conventional real estate market before the Lapple family
turned to cyberspace.</TE>
<TE>   So who would offer a small fortune for this, sight unseen? Plenty
of people. The Lapple family received 240 online bids, from as far
away as Iceland and Germany. Some bidders are wealthy urbanites eager
to paint the blank canvas of Bridgeville with the broad brush of
their own escapist fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby boomers have had to live in that rat race, and they're
getting ready to retire," said Realtor Denise Stuart, who will earn a
6% commission. "They can sell their homes" in Los Angeles or New York
City, "come up here and almost buy a whole town for that."</TE>
<TE>   True to the Internet, there were also plenty of jokers and flakes
among senders of the several thousand e-mails. Besides the proposed
Town of Ill Repute, there was the woman who proposed a trade -- for a
crystal necklace. And the smart aleck who asked, "How much for
shipping?"</TE>
<TE>   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said it appears the town is the
first ever sold on the site. If the deal goes through, it could also
set a record for the priciest real estate transaction on EBay. (A
Kentucky resort sold for $1.3 million two years ago.) The auction
began Nov. 27 but the bidding frenzy only started in earnest
Christmas Day, after media accounts lured thousands of hits.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other auctions on EBay, real estate transactions do not
bind the seller and buyer to complete their deal. The Web site merely
serves as a matchmaking service.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, the hard work of inspections and escrow has
just begun. That means that, when the mystery mogul shows up in town
to kick its proverbial tires, as he plans to do within the next two
weeks, the deal could quickly fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   And plenty of people around here think it might.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, they're going to have buyer's remorse," said Eureka Realtor
Karen Wasson, who had a client drive out to examine the Bridgeville
property Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Wasson's clients had seen the town on the Multiple Listing Service
-- or MLS -- the traditional outlet for real estate sales. The asking
price: $775,000. But they told Wasson they wouldn't pay a cent more
than $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "All the roofs need to be replaced. There's fungus and dry-rot
everywhere they could see," said Wasson.</TE>
<TE>   George Rolff, a broker with Country Real Estate in Garberville who
has sold Humboldt County real estate for three decades, called the
bid "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a quaint, picturesque, tumbling-down town on the edge of a
river that's eroding" in a region whose economy is "extremely
depressed," he said. "I'm sure it's somebody's imagination that's
running away with them."</TE>
<TE>   Towns, he added, are a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   The Lapples bought unincorporated Bridgeville in 1972 for
$160,000. The early years were happy ones. Edward and his brother
created a pirate radio station in a trailer where they played their
own rock 'n' roll for their own makeshift hippie haven. But his
brother died and his mother found caring for the town draining. When
she died too, the task largely fell to Elizabeth, who lacked the
resources and time to really fix things up.</TE>
<TE>   The family owns the roads, the water system, the street lights and
the town's cluster of rentals. That translates into a fat bundle of
disclosures that any buyer will have to review.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Realtor's nightmare," Rolff said.</TE>
<TE>   Even more prosperous towns in this part of the state have found
buyers hard to come by. Take Myers Flat, south of Bridgeville.
Situated on U.S. 101, it boasts a functioning saloon, inn and
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Meagher, 77, owns all that -- more than half the town. But
when he put it up for sale a decade ago, he got no serious takers. He
also did his own survey of Bridgeville for his attorney in the 1970s,
when the Lapples first tried to sell. "I told him the best thing you
can do with Bridgeville is stay out of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, real estate values are largely defined by the amount a
buyer will fork over, and in the go-go California market, that means
out-of-towners often set the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the local people that make things go here," said
Meagher, a retired merchant seaman who moved north from Lomita three
decades ago. "They bad-mouth everything. Then someone comes in from
Los Angeles or San Francisco and grabs something and turns it into
something real nice."</TE>
<TE>   Although such deals are rare, other towns have sold in their
entirety or are on the block. Amboy, on historic Route 66 in the
Mojave Desert, was recently listed at $1.9 million, down from an
unofficial price of $5 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   It boasts a working gas station, motel and cafe, where Harrison
Ford sometimes flies in for hamburgers, as well as a church, a
cluster of one-room bungalows and 690 acres -- eight times the size
of Bridgeville.</TE>
<TE>   Ads in the Wall Street Journal and the exclusive real estate
magazine Christie's Great Estates have generated plenty of interest,
but the agent for the property, Rob McManus of San Marino, said a
lightbulb went off when he heard about Bridgeville's crazy bidding
war.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm toying with the idea," he said. "It's just whacked enough,
and Amboy has enough going for it.... It might be worth examining."</TE>

<HD>Victims of 1990 O.C. Oil Spill to Split $4 Million</HD>
<DH>Proposed settlement would end 12 years of litigation over
the American Trader disaster off Huntington Beach, Newport Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 200 fishermen, oceanfront businesses and property owners
will share $4 million to settle the last remaining lawsuit from a
disastrous 1990 tanker accident that fouled the Orange County coast
with nearly half a million gallons of Alaskan crude oil.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, if approved next month by a federal judge, will
close the books on one of the state's worst oil spills and end a
12-year-old court battle that turned into a bitter paper war with
attorneys for the ship owner.</LD>
<LD>   "This is good news. I was wondering if they were going to wait
until all of us were dead," said Dale Sleight, 54, a former
lobsterman from Garden Grove who claims his fishing business was
ruined by the spill. "If this comes through, it will be a windfall. I
thought nothing would ever come of this."</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, a $4-million fund would be set up
for about 250 businesses and individuals who claimed they suffered
financial losses from the February 1990 disaster that occurred when
the American Trader hit its own anchor while mooring at an offshore
terminal near Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The spill affected 15 miles of Orange County coastline, closing
beaches, harbors and waters just off shore for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Among those seeking damages are members of the historic Newport
Beach dory fleet, fish canneries in San Pedro, and the 296-room
Hilton in Huntington Beach, which had been preparing its grand
opening when the crude washed ashore. The group of business owners
originally sought $14 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The case has dragged on so long that some of the original
plaintiffs have died.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the settlement fund, court records state that the
defendants will pay the plaintiffs' legal fees and court costs, to be
determined at a later date. Also in those papers, they denied any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Named as defendants are BP America Inc.; Golden West Refining Co.,
the terminal operator; Attransco Inc., the tanker owner; and
Brandenburger Marine Inc., the employer of the American Trader's
harbor pilot. The class-action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District
Court seven days after the spill.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides finally came to a settlement agreement after several
months of discussions and filed the proposed terms in court Dec. 20.
Judge Robert J. Kelleher will rule on the proposal Jan. 13.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," said Shawn Millbern, a senior vice president
with Robert Mayer Corp., which owns the Waterfront Hilton Beach
Resort, which originally sought $2.7 million in damages. "This is
certainly good Christmas news."</TE>
<TE>   The spill had a wide and immediate effect. The bountiful
Huntington Flats fishing grounds were temporarily shut down. Harbor
entrances were sealed off, preventing tour boats, Catalina-bound
ferries and fishing boats from going to sea. Visitors, conventioneers
and tourists canceled hotel reservations or cut short their stays.
Owners of beachfront vacation rentals said they had a difficult time
attracting renters for months.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing," said Douglas Edlund, 61, a Corona del Mar real estate
investor who has asked for $6,500 in lost income from an oceanfront
duplex on 66th Street in Newport Beach. "With all the costs of going
to court, I am glad to see there is something left for people making
claims."</TE>
<TE>   John Reilly, an attorney for the tanker owner, declined to discuss
the case. Gretchen Nelson, one of several attorneys for the
plaintiffs, could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Court Rebuffs Ex-Officer Who Alleged Brutality</HD>
<DH>Former member of Anaheim gang detail isn't entitled to a
disability pension because he fears retaliation, court says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Anaheim police officer who accused fellow gang investigators
of beating suspects is not entitled to a disability pension because
he feared harassment from fellow officers, according to a state
appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Nolan, the former officer who angered his colleagues in
1992 when he accused them of brutality, may have had reason for fear
in Anaheim, but not necessarily in other police departments in the
state, according to the decision.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana has ordered Orange
County Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald to reconsider a 2000
court decision and determine whether Nolan could work for another
department without fear of retaliation.</LD>
<TE>   The decision, filed Thursday, was greeted warmly by city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's gratified with the decision," said City Atty. Jack L.
White. "There's no evidence in the record that would support a
disability retirement. We're confident that ultimately he'll be
denied a disability pension."</TE>
<TE>   Nolan, according to court documents, began working for the Anaheim
Police Department in 1984 and was deemed a "stellar" officer. His
troubles started six years later when he joined the department's gang
detail.</TE>
<TE>   Telling his superiors that he suspected fellow officers of
manhandling suspects, Nolan saw his relationship with his colleagues
grow strained, he said. An internal affairs investigation exonerated
the other officers.</TE>
<TE>   However, disciplinary charges were brought against Nolan, 40, for
offenses such as conduct unbecoming an officer, unsatisfactory
performance and improper handling of evidence. He was fired in 1993.
Nolan sued the city for wrongful termination and said he was being
punished because he was a whistle-blower. A jury agreed and awarded
him $340,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan also had his dismissal overturned by an arbitrator but never
returned to work. He said he received two threatening telephone calls
that he believes were made by fellow officers.</TE>
<TE>   After someone shot out a window in his wife's car, Nolan saw
several mental health evaluators and told them that he feared for his
safety if he returned to work and that he was disillusioned with
police work. The evaluators said he suffered from depression and
greatly feared that he was viewed as a "snitch" by fellow officers.
Nolan demanded a disability pension and took his case to court.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, McDonald found Nolan permanently incapacitated and
awarded him disability retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim appealed the decision, and a panel of three judges found
fault with the lower court's decision. The appeals court judges said
the lower court relied improperly on a stereotype of police officers
and the notion of a code of silence.</TE>
<TE>   It hadn't been proved, they said, that police officers in other
departments would automatically retaliate against Nolan.</TE>

<HD>Firm Says It Created First Human Clone</HD>
<DH>Although skepticism abounds, scientists don't entirely
reject the claim that a religious group believing in UFOs may have
produced 'Eve.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOLLYWOOD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A member of a religious movement that claims space aliens created
life on Earth announced Friday that her company had produced the
first human clone, but provided no scientific proof.</LD>
<LD>   The news prompted widespread skepticism and criticism, but experts
in reproductive science did not wholly reject the possibility that
the group could have done as it claimed.</LD>
<LD>   Brigitte Boisselier, a chemist, said a 7-pound girl was born by
Caesarean section Thursday to a 31-year-old American woman in an
unspecified country. The scientists nicknamed the girl "Eve."</LD>
<TE>   The mother, whose husband is infertile, supposedly donated DNA
from her own skin cells to make her daughter a genetic twin of
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby is very healthy," Boisselier, who is scientific director
of Clonaid, the company that claims to have made medical history,
told a news conference at a beachfront hotel. "The parents are happy.
I hope that you remember them when you talk about this baby -- not
like a monster, like the results of something that is disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier declined to divulge where Clonaid is conducting its
experiments, saying only that Eve "was born yesterday at 11:55 a.m.
in the country where she was born." A U.S. Food and Drug
Administration official in Washington said the agency would
investigate whether U.S. laws regulating experiments on humans had
been broken.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the infant is a clone, the report of her
birth reactivated a national debate about the morality and
desirability of exploiting scientific discoveries to create human
beings, with religious groups, scientists, ethicists, talk show hosts
and the White House all weighing in.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush "believes, like most Americans, that human cloning
is deeply troubling," said deputy White House press secretary Scott
McClellan, reacting to Clonaid's claims. "And he strongly supports
legislation banning all human cloning."</TE>
<TE>   At her news conference, Boisselier didn't identify Eve's mother,
provide a photograph of the newborn or offer any other proof to back
up her claim, but said results of a DNA test, showing the daughter to
be a genetic match of her mother, would be available within nine
days.</TE>
<TE>   "You can still go back to your office and treat me as a fraud,"
she told the journalists, many of whom were overtly dubious. "You
have one week to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists and infertility doctors called the news far-fetched and
disgusting.</TE>
<TE>   "What a sad day for science," said Dr. Robert Lanza, a vice
president of Advanced Cell Technology, a Worcester, Mass., company
researching cloning for medical and agricultural purposes. "What
they've done is both appalling and irresponsible, and whether or not
it's true they've done a tremendous disservice to all of us in the
scientific community."</TE>
<TE>   For a report of this magnitude, one needs a high standard of
proof, said Hank Greely, professor of law and a bioethicist at
Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about science announced by press conference by a
religious cult," Greely said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lanza said, it was too early to declare Boisselier's
announcement a hoax. "I don't think it's advisable to dismiss these
claims," he said. "Someone will succeed eventually."</TE>
<TE>   Some researchers expressed concern that the sensational
announcement from a group so far from the scientific mainstream --
and linked to a religion believing in flying saucers -- might further
ensnare a branch of medical research that is already controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists wish to clone human embryos not to produce babies,
but to acquire stem cells for medical purposes. They hope one day to
produce genetically matched cells for Alzheimer's patients, heart
attack victims and other people whose body tissues have stopped
functioning normally.</TE>
<TE>   "The backlash could cripple an area of medical research that could
serve millions of people," Lanza said.</TE>
<TE>   Steps should be made to ban reproductive cloning while leaving the
door open for therapeutic cloning, Lanza and other scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, legislation to outlaw reproductive cloning has
stalled because members of Congress cannot agree whether to ban both
types of cloning.</TE>
<TE>   To prove that the baby is a clone of its mother, one would have to
take DNA samples of both, then compare the DNA structure of both
samples at many sites to ensure that they are perfect matches.</TE>
<TE>   Those taking the samples and performing the analyses should be
independent scientists who were not chosen by Clonaid, scientists
widely agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier said she had arranged for former ABC News science
editor Michael Guillen to verify Clonaid's claim. Guillen -- a UCLA
graduate and instructor of physics and mathematics at Harvard -- told
the news conference he was searching for well-known experts in
genetics to test DNA samples from the mother and child, and was not
being paid by Clonaid.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid, which purports to be the world's "first cloning company,"
was started five years ago in the Bahamas. Its founder is former
French sports journalist Claude Vorilhon, leader of a religious group
known as the Raelians who now calls himself the prophet Rael. In the
1970s, Raelians believe, a green-skinned extraterrestrial in a UFO
visited Vorilhon in central France, and revealed to him that the
aliens had created all life on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier, who has a doctorate in chemistry, has identified
herself as a bishop in the Raelian faith. Her secret laboratory in
West Virginia was closed last year after its existence became public.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have cloned a host of mammals, including sheep, mice,
cows, pigs, goats and cats, but the procedure has been plagued by a
high failure rate and birth defects.</TE>
<TE>   In these efforts, the genetic code is stripped from an
unfertilized egg and replaced with DNA from the animal to be cloned.
Boisselier said Eve's mother donated her own DNA, had the modified
embryo implanted in her womb, gestated the fetus to term and gave
birth.</TE>
<TE>   Four more children cloned under the company's auspices should also
be born in the coming weeks, Boisselier said, and 20 more cloning
attempts are planned next month.</TE>
<TE>   Not all scientists and physicians are against the notion of
cloning for reproductive purposes if it could be done safely.</TE>
<TE>   "I think cloning human beings, as a potential way to solve certain
extreme forms of infertility, would be a desirable breakthrough,"
said Dr. Richard Grazi, director of reproductive endocrinology and
infertility for Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   But Grazi said he condemned the Clonaid attempt because the
science suggests that cloning is not yet safe: "It is clearly wrong
to experiment on people."</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, fertility doctor Severino Antinori, who already had
announced that a cloned boy would be born next month, dismissed
Clonaid's announcement. Its claim, he said, "makes me laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Human cloning has been opposed by most mainstream religious
groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, which holds that the
practice offends moral law because it denies "the dignity of human
procreation and of the conjugal union." Other religious opponents
warn that human cloning represents an attempt by humans to put
themselves on a par with God.</TE>
<TE>   "The very attempt to clone a human being is evil," said Stanley M.
Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics at Duke University. "The
assumption that we must do what we can do is fueled by the Promethean
desire to be our own creators."</TE>

<HD>80 Fall Ill on Cruise Ship in Caribbean</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>About 80 people became ill while sailing the Caribbean on a Royal
Caribbean Cruises ship, the fifth luxury vessel to have such an
outbreak in recent weeks, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The illness has not yet been identified, but victims suffer from
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea often associated with a Norwalk-like
virus, a nonlethal virus that affects about 181,000 Americans each
year. Nearly all recover within a few days.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 passengers and crew members on ships sailing the
Caribbean from U.S. ports have come down with gastrointestinal
illnesses over the last month.</LD>
<TE>   "They just came in this morning, so it is a little premature to
determine the cause," said David Forney, director of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention division that oversees
sanitation aboard cruise ships stopping at U.S. ports.</TE>
<TE>   Forney said symptoms reported in the latest cases appear similar
to those in previously reported outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean, Lynn Martenstein, said 70
passengers and 10 crew members aboard the Majesty of the Seas
reported flu-like symptoms during the four-day cruise to the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   About half of those passengers chose to get off the ship at Key
West, the last stop before returning to Miami. They were bused with
their traveling companions to Miami.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Mayor Richard M. Daley and his wife were hospitalized Friday after
fainting at home, doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   Maggie Daley may have broken a rib when she fell, said Dr. David
Zull of Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The couple were taken to the
hospital by ambulance.</LD>
<LD>   Both Daleys experienced "fairly violent" vomiting and diarrhea and
were being treated for dehydration, said Zull, an emergency room
doctor. "They're resting pretty comfortably."</LD>
<TE>   Daley spokeswoman Jacqueline Heard said both were being held
overnight -- the mayor for observation and his wife for treatment of
her rib.</TE>
<TE>   Zull said food poisoning was possible, but it was more likely
stomach flu.</TE>
<TE>   Daley, 60, has been hospitalized at least twice since he was
elected mayor in 1989. His wife, 59, was diagnosed with breast cancer
in June. Zull said her current symptoms appeared to be unrelated to
the cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The Daleys were married in 1972 and have four children.</TE>

<HD>Series of Storms Presents Fast Solution to East Coast
Drought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>A rainy, snowy fall and early winter are quickly quenching the
remnants of the two-year drought along the East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The Christmas storm that blew across Pennsylvania, New York and
New England was icing on the cake for soil moisture and groundwater
watchers, said Randy Durlin of the U.S. Geological Survey in
Harrisburg.</LD>
<LD>   Even before the storm, Durlin said Friday, "we've seen great
recovery. It's been perfect, it's just been slow rain. The ground
didn't freeze, so it soaked in."</LD>
<TE>   Drought designations were already lifted in Pennsylvania and most
East Coast states, though concerns remained about low water tables
and aquifers in New Jersey, central Virginia and Maine's northern
tip.</TE>
<TE>   "If we keep this pattern going, pretty soon those areas will be
going too," said David Miskus, a meteorologist at the National
Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center. "It took a long time to
build this drought. We've actually cut it back pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The long drought lowered wells, slowed waterways and damaged
agriculture, leaving farmers with the worst corn crop in years and
limiting water for livestock. Many areas declared drought
emergencies, limiting such activities as washing cars and watering
lawns; many also banned outdoor burning.</TE>
<TE>   The drought emergency ended in Pennsylvania when Gov. Mark
Schweiker lifted the designation for three remaining counties Dec.
19. Monitoring wells that showed below-normal water tables in
southeastern Pennsylvania have risen rapidly in the last few weeks to
normal or above-normal levels, Durlin said.</TE>
<TE>   A drought emergency is in effect in New Jersey. The Department of
Environmental Protection lifted water restrictions in the northern
part of the state, but environmental Commissioner Bradley Campbell
said southern New Jersey aquifers would take longer to replenish.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the last things to recharge," Miskus said. "We'll
slowly chisel it away."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in northern Maine said it would take several consecutive
months of above-normal precipitation to restore groundwater levels to
normal.</TE>
<TE>   As it melts, the new 1- to 2-foot blanket of snow from
northeastern Pennsylvania to New England will continue to pour water
into streams and reservoirs, raising groundwater levels.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate drought continues as far east as Michigan, according to
the National Drought Mitigation Center run by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
other agencies. The Christmas snow was particularly encouraging to
officials at the Delaware River Basin Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Catskill Mountain reservoirs that send drinking water to New York
City were at record lows in January, and after a virtually snowless
winter remained low in June going into the dry summer months, DRBC
spokesman Chris Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   After the wet fall, the reservoirs were rippling with 213 billion
gallons of water -- 79% of capacity compared with a normal of 68% for
most of December.</TE>
<TE>   Tributaries were brimming and rivers flowed strongly. The "salt
line" where Atlantic Ocean water mingles with fresh water flowing
downstream was 70 miles above the mouth of Delaware Bay, four miles
below its normal location for the date.</TE>

<HD>Case Against Cardinal Egan Ruled Baseless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A sexual misconduct allegation against Cardinal Edward Egan dating to
1969 is unfounded, prosecutors in Illinois said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cook County state's attorney's office investigated "and found
no credible evidence on which to proceed," spokesman John Gorman
said.</LD>
<LD>   In August, Illinois authorities notified the New York Archdiocese
that a man said Egan sexually abused him when he was a boy in Chicago
in 1969, archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling said. The same person
accused more than 20 "high-profile persons," including national
political figures, Zwilling said.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the Chicago Archdiocese nor the Cook County state's
attorney would comment on whether the person had made other
allegations or if other investigations were underway.</TE>
<TE>   Zwilling said Egan cooperated with the investigation, but denied
the charges and had never heard of the person who made them.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Francis George of Chicago notified Egan on Friday that
his archdiocese's review board also found no basis for the
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Egan, ordained in 1957, worked in Chicago from 1958 to 1960 and
from 1964 to 1971.</TE>
<TE>   As a bishop in Bridgeport, critics say, Egan failed to notify
authorities about abuse allegations involving diocesan priests and
allowed several priests facing such allegations to continue working.</TE>

<HD>'Whining,' 'Stupid' Essay Costs N.Y. Official His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The city fired the head of its customer service office after he
admitted calling New Yorkers "whining" and "stupid" in an essay on
the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   "I take painkillers, sleep a lot and think about killing every
citizen and employee of New York City every minute I'm awake,"
Fletcher Vredenburgh, the former director of the Mayor's Action
Center, wrote in an essay on the "FightLikeApes" Web site.</LD>
<LD>   Vredenburgh told the New York Post in Friday's editions that he
had written the unsigned essay soon after he was appointed as head of
the center, which handles complaints about City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Vredenburgh, 36, was hired to the $44,000-a-year director's job by
then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vredenburgh said in the essay that he was responsible for handling
complaints from "griping, often whining, often stupid New Yorkers."
Ed Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said Bloomberg
accepted Vredenburgh's resignation -- effective immediately -- after
Vredenburgh admitted writing the essay.</TE>
<TE>   "The sentiments expressed on the Web site fly in the face of the
citizen-service mentality the mayor seeks to establish in city
government, and are downright offensive," Skyler said.</TE>
<TE>   Vredenburgh declined to comment Friday. A message on the Web site
said it was down because of technical difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Vredenburgh posted a message on the Mayor's Action Center Web site
before he was fired: "I hope you have a fruitful, pleasant and
positive experience with New York City government. We all look
forward to serving you in the years to come."</TE>

<HD>It's the Republicans' Turn to Find a Health-Care Cure</HD>
<DH>Unlike Clinton, who proposed universal coverage, the GOP
has a free-market vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Eight years after Bill Clinton's attempt to restructure the
health-care system nearly capsized his presidency, circumstances are
propelling President Bush toward another confrontation with the
enduring problems of cost, access and equity in American medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and the incoming Republican majority in Congress aren't
considering reforms as sweeping as Clinton's failed proposal for
universal health coverage. But with the system falling into a spiral
of rising costs and declining access, Congress and the administration
are approaching pointed debates on a daunting menu of health-care
dilemmas.</LD>
<LD>   Topping the list are questions about how to provide prescription
drugs for senior citizens; reform Medicare before baby boomers
retire; protect state public health programs facing potentially
crippling cutbacks because of huge budget deficits; and, most
perplexingly, reduce the number of Americans without health
insurance, which is rapidly rising again.</LD>
<TE>   In all, the interlocked problems are beginning to resemble the
ominous conditions in the early 1990s that inspired Clinton's
unsuccessful quest to guarantee coverage for all. "It's been almost
10 years since health care was on the national agenda," said Dr. E.
Richard Brown, director of UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research.
"It hasn't gone away."</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, the growing anxiety concerning health care could prove a
principal domestic vulnerability in a 2004 reelection campaign. But
Republicans also see an unprecedented opportunity in the new year to
redefine the party's image on an issue where the public has usually
placed more trust in Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   With the GOP set to control both chambers of Congress, and Bill
Frist of Tennessee, a physician, emerging as the new Senate majority
leader, Republicans may have their best chance to define a
free-market vision of health-care reform. The question will be
whether they can sell that vision to a public skeptical of many of
the most powerful players in that market, such as insurance companies
and drug manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   After relative calm during the boom years of the mid- to late
1990s, the health-care system today seems under stress from virtually
every angle.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid increases in pharmaceutical prices are straining the budgets
of senior citizens and generating sustained pressure to provide a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But that pressure is coming
even as the steadily growing cost of Medicare -- fueled by the rise
in medical costs and by the growing number of retirees -- is itself
straining the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a renewed surge in the cost of health insurance, which
had moderated in the mid-1990s, is pressuring employers and driving
up the number of people without coverage. Health insurance premiums
for employers jumped by almost 13% this year, the second consecutive
year of double-digit increases and the largest one-year spike since
1990, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey.</TE>
<TE>   While virtually all large employers still insure workers, the
share of smaller employers offering coverage has dropped from 67% in
2000 to 61% now.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer employers providing coverage, the number of people in
the country without health insurance jumped by 1.4 million, to 41.2
million, during Bush's first year in office. That erased a steady
decline from 1998 to 2000 that reduced the number of uninsured by
more than 4 million.</TE>
<TE>   With the economy still weak, most experts believe the number of
uninsured increased even more in 2002 (though the Census Bureau won't
report the final figures until September).</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem, even as the availability of workplace
insurance is eroding, a nationwide budget crunch is forcing states to
retrench Medicaid, the joint state-federal program that provides
coverage for the poor. California alone is considering cuts that
would reduce its Medicaid rolls by 500,000 over the next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, some Republicans see dissatisfaction
concerning health care as one of the greatest potential dangers to
Bush in 2004. In a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 33% of Americans
said they approved of his handling of health-care issues -- a much
weaker grade than he got for his handling of the economy, which was
50% in the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The White House recognizes the vulnerability. Aides are putting
out the word that health-care initiatives will have a prominent place
in Bush's agenda for the new year.</TE>
<TE>   When representatives of two dozen health industry trade
associations were invited to the White House for a recent briefing
with the domestic policy staff, Karl Rove, Bush's top political
advisor, made an impromptu appearance and promised that the
administration "would be aggressive and get things done," according
to one source familiar with the meeting. "That is intended to send a
signal, and it did," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   But signaling interest and achieving results are different things.
Republicans and Democrats remain sharply divided about how to
confront the principal challenges in the health-care system, which
could make it difficult for Bush to move his ideas through the
narrowly divided Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republican control of both chambers and the White House and
the ascendance of Frist, who has specialized in health-care issues
since arriving in Congress in 1995, could give the White House agenda
new momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Details on the White House health-care plans are being closely
held and, by several accounts, still being finalized. But Bush
already has made some of his priorities clear.</TE>
<TE>   On the uninsured, Bush last year offered an agenda with several
components. One element has broad appeal among liberals: increasing
funding for community health centers that provide care to the
uninsured. Bush also wants to expand medical savings accounts, a
conservative favorite that provides tax-free accounts in which
individuals can save money to pay most of their medical expenses
while buying insurance only to cover catastrophic costs.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Bush's agenda for the uninsured has been a
proposal to provide tax credits to help individuals and families buy
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Most Democrats and consumer groups oppose the idea because they
believe the tax credits (as much as $1,000 for individuals and $3,000
for families in Bush's version) are too small to help many of the
uninsured afford coverage. They also fear that subsidizing people to
buy individual insurance will unravel the employer-based health
insurance system, which provides coverage for more than three-fifths
of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the principal Democratic alternative has been
expanding the joint state-federal public programs that cover the
uninsured, especially the Children's Health Insurance Program. But
some Democratic experts say that idea looks less viable because the
economic downturn has left states without enough money to fund their
share of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Democrats are increasingly discussing tax credits
that would help employers fund insurance for their workers.</TE>
<TE>   On Medicare, the Republican takeover of the Senate will increase
the odds that the GOP can push through its version of a prescription
drug plan for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   With White House support, the House last year narrowly approved a
$320-billion, 10-year plan to subsidize private insurance companies
to offer prescription drug plans to senior citizens. But the
Democratic-led Senate blocked the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans argue that providing the benefit through private
insurers will give senior citizens more choices and flexibility; the
vast majority of Democrats want to funnel more generous aid directly
through Medicare, insisting that that will provide more uniform
benefits and help keep down drug prices through the government's bulk
purchasing power.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush has insisted that it
makes little sense to add the drug benefit to the program without
reforming Medicare. But he faces difficult decisions on how much
reform to attempt.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Bush endorsed "premium support," an idea advanced by
Sens. John B. Breaux (D-La.) and Frist to fundamentally restructure
Medicare. The vast majority of Medicare recipients now receive care
under a traditional fee-for-service program in which Washington
directly compensates doctors and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Breaux-Frist plan, Medicare would provide senior
citizens a fixed sum (with low-income seniors getting more) to
purchase private insurance from approved plans.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters believe that approach would increase competition and
eventually save money. But that idea generated intense resistance
from Democrats and seniors groups, who argued it would sharply raise
premiums for senior citizens who wanted to stay in the existing
fee-for-service system, and also allow the affluent to buy better
care.</TE>
<TE>   Though many Republicans still would like to steer Medicare toward
the premium support model over time, most expect the party to move
cautiously in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charged that the Breaux-Frist plan aimed to push senior
citizens out of fee-for-service Medicare through higher premiums.
Most expect the White House will now try to entice seniors into
privately run plans by providing those who switch with more generous
benefits, particularly for prescription drugs.</TE>

<HD>Congress Set to Do Battle Over Extending Jobless Aid</HD>
<DH>With benefits expiring for nearly 800,000 today, parties
need to settle major differences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With jobless benefits lapsing today for nearly 800,000 workers and
the economy still sputtering, top Republican lawmakers are laying
plans to extend federal unemployment aid soon after Congress convenes
in early January.</LD>
<LD>   But a partisan battle is developing over how much aid should be
approved. Democrats want to send more unemployment checks to the
jobless in every state. Some leading Republicans want to limit
assistance to states and workers they say need it most.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the outcome, both parties agree that unemployment aid has
zoomed toward the top of the agenda for the 108th Congress. That's a
significant turnabout. The 107th punted on the issue in late November
after President Bush declined to intervene.</LD>
<TE>   But two weeks ago, after a sharp upturn in the monthly
unemployment rate, Bush shifted course, seeking to neutralize an
issue Democrats could use against him in the 2004 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The president urged the new Congress in his Dec. 14 radio address
to extend jobless benefits under a temporary program enacted in March
to stimulate an economy battered by recession and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. He also called for the benefit renewal legislation
to apply retroactively to compensate jobless workers for aid they
would lose after today.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, House GOP leaders floated a plan to answer the
president's call. And this week, Senate Republicans agreed on the
importance of the matter even as they were voting to promote Sen.
Bill Frist of Tennessee to Senate majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our first orders of business out of the box ... is to deal
with the unemployment insurance problem that we have in the country
right now," said Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, chairman of the
Senate Republican Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, anticipating today's expiration of federal unemployment
benefits, on Friday attacked House Republicans and Bush for allowing
the program to run out.</TE>
<TE>   "Regrettably, the House Republican leadership turned their backs
on these families and refused to act, and the administration chose
not to intervene before Congress adjourned," said Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. "This inaction by Republicans was
unconscionable then, and it is even more so now."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also said Bush's call for jobless benefits to be
extended retroactively would be of small comfort to the many people
who live from check to check.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 780,000 people will lose unemployment benefits as of
today, including about 104,000 from California, according to
congressional Democrats. These workers already had used up the
typical 26 weeks of state jobless assistance and had been receiving
additional benefits from the federal government under the March law.</TE>
<TE>   But with the national unemployment rate at 6% in November -- an
eight-year high -- the problem of expiring benefits encompasses more
people than those directly affected today. More than 1 million
jobless workers nationwide already had exhausted government benefits
before the cutoff.</TE>
<TE>   And an additional 90,000 or more per week are projected to do so
in coming weeks. One is Nancy Miller, 53, of San Francisco. She was
laid off in July from a well-paying job as a project manager for
WorldCom Inc. Her $330 weekly unemployment check from the state,
which had covered her mortgage and health insurance, will run out
early next month. Miller, who is single and has no dependents, said
her situation is not desperate. But she said she needs more income to
tide her over until she can find a new job.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Miller said, she will have to skim from her
already-depleted retirement savings. "We're dipping into a pot that
is starting to scrape bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was one of many unemployed workers whom the AFL-CIO
recruited to speak this week with reporters to spotlight the benefits
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The labor group also arranged a media conference call on Friday to
publicize the plight of unemployed workers losing benefits just three
days after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   On the line were workers and labor activists from Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Alabama, Tennessee, Texas, New York and elsewhere --
all bitter at Congress for allowing the benefits to lapse.</TE>
<TE>   "They give themselves a raise before they leave and leave all of
us Americans high and dry," said Laurie Carmichael, 39, mother of two
and wife of an unemployed telecommunications worker who lives outside
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers will get a 3.1% raise in January, boosting annual pay
for senators and House members to $154,700 from $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   In November, before Congress adjourned, the House and Senate
failed to reconcile two bills they had passed to extend the benefits
program. The Senate bill would have run the program an additional 13
weeks at a cost of $5 billion; the House version five weeks for about
$1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Now, those bills have been set aside as lawmakers draft new
measures in preparation for a clash in early January.</TE>
<TE>   The leading Democratic plan, sponsored by Reps. Charles B. Rangel
of New York and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, would guarantee all
unemployed workers as many as 26 weeks of federal benefits -- 13 more
than what Congress authorized in March.</TE>
<TE>   A tentative proposal by top House Republicans would allow those
who, under the expiring program, did not receive the entire 13 weeks
of extra federal benefits to collect them. It would also set up a
nine-week federal aid program for the jobless in 16 states, including
California, with high unemployment rates.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would hitch these provisions to a tax break for business,
halting for one year the jobless tax employers pay.</TE>
<TE>   Both Democratic and GOP proposals would be paid for through the
federal unemployment insurance fund, which has about $24 billion
available.</TE>

<HD>Storm Knocks Out Power in Northwest; Boy Killed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A winter storm whipped the coasts of Oregon and Washington on Friday,
dumped snow in the western mountains and knocked out power to
thousands of people before sweeping north into Canada. One child was
killed.</LD>
<LD>   More than 300,000 homes and businesses were without power at the
height of the storm, when wind gusted to 45 mph in the Puget Sound
region. The strongest gust -- 128 mph -- was recorded at White Pass,
Wash., in the Cascades.</LD>
<LD>   Cody Allen Brown, 10, died when he became tangled in a downed
7,200-volt power line near his home outside Olympia. The boy's
grandmother pulled him from the live power line, McLane Fire District
9 spokesman Davie Foster said. "It's a miracle she wasn't hurt," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   In downtown Seattle, a 20-year-old man who was knocked unconscious
by a flying canopy.</TE>
<TE>   Utility crews were working around the clock, hoping to restore
power to all customers over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's storm also brought snow to the Olympics and Cascades --
with 6 inches to a foot expected at elevations above 5,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had crews out since 1 a.m.," said Shannon Shoul,
spokeswoman for PacifiCorp, which reported that 12,000 customers in
southern and central coastal Oregon had their electricity cut by the
storm. "The wind was pretty heavy through the night, but it looks
like things are lightening up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCorp, a unit of Scottish Power, had restored power to all
but 3,000 homes by midmorning, Shoul said.</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, near Portland on the Washington border, about
15,000 homes were without power and crews were repairing major
service lines, Portland General Electric spokesman Kregg Arntson
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a child inside a car hit by a falling tree in
eastern Pierce County suffered minor injuries, sheriff's spokesman Ed
Troyer said. Winds also blew a tree down on a house in Fircrest,
south of Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   Two barges tied together broke loose from a buoy in Seattle's
Elliott Bay and drifted toward the piers along the downtown
waterfront. Six tugboats raced to bring the barges under control near
Pier 70.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there was concern, but they got ahold of it before it
could cause any damage," said Aida Cabrera, a spokeswoman for the
Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   The drama frayed nerves among employees at Waterfront Seafood
Grill on Pier 70, as they watched the barge creep closer.</TE>
<TE>   Mindy McNeely, a hostess, said she had just clocked in when she
looked up, saw the barges and said: "Wait a minute. This is too
close. It's not supposed to be this close. It was right there. I knew
there was a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Chef J.J. Holes said that at one point, he thought the barge was
going to hit the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "If it gets within 30 to 40 feet," he recalled thinking, "we're
going to run. It would've been history."</TE>
<TE>   Another barge broke loose off Tacoma, which tugs also brought
under control quickly.</TE>

<HD>AME Leader Rises to Major Challenges</HD>
<DH>The former drum major is targeting AIDS and racial
injustice during his year as head of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Weisenmiller</AU>
<BD>Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Years ago, Bishop Adam J. Richardson Jr. led the pep band at Florida
A&amp;M University. Now, as national leader of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church, he brings that same "rah-rah" energy for life to
his one-year post.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson, 54, was head drum major for the "Marching 100." To
work off stress, the bishop still has a drum pad and sticks in his
office, which he will beat away at whenever he is contemplating his
next step.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson, invested as president of the AME Bishops Council in a
June ceremony in Tampa, has much to contemplate during his term. He
oversees the AME Church in the United States and part of South
Africa, tackling issues such as AIDS, racial injustice and youth
formation. "I bang that drum pad a lot," Richardson said with a
chuckle.</LD>
<TE>   A Tampa native, Richardson began his ministry in Georgia. He spent
18 years at the Bethel AME Church in Tallahassee, Fla., where his
energy and community activism caught the attention of church leaders.
Chosen a bishop in 1996, Richardson was stationed in South Africa to
head the church's 19th District -- a post he still holds, dividing
his time between Florida and Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   "He's eloquent, he's dynamic and he researches his messages
thoroughly," said Bethel member Mary Newell, who teaches philosophy
at Florida A&amp;M in Tallahassee. As a member of Bethel, she handled
public relations for Richardson's successful campaign for bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis level of HIV infection and AIDS is his main pastoral
concern in Africa, the bishop said. At a church conference in
Johannesburg in early December, he urged area AME pastors to take a
greater role in educating people about the deadly disease.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with "the most up-to-date information" from the conference,
the pastors will "get out on the streets and talk about HIV and AIDS
to the poor, the prostitutes, anybody who will listen," Richardson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Grass-roots activism is nothing new for Richardson, said Bethel
member and Tallahassee resident Gwen Parker. Concerned about the
disproportionate number of African Americans in state prisons,
Richardson and other Bethel members met with civic leaders several
times to discuss the issue, Parker recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bishop is working on a few AME programs to fight racial
injustice in a thoroughly Christian way. One project underway is a
prison ministry to provide religious counseling for black inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said he is also proposing that the AME Church create a
network of halfway houses for African Americans just released from
prison "so that we could also cut down on the high number of black
prisoners who are repeat offenders."</TE>
<TE>   In an age of racial integration and denominational indifference
among the youth, Richardson still sees a special role for his
historically black church, which was organized by slaves and former
slaves in Philadelphia in 1816 after protests over segregation in
area churches.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our younger members come to church and they just don't
know [the AME Church's history]," Richardson said. "We need to start
classes for these younger members that specialize solely on our
history, so that they have a sense of pride about the church."</TE>

<HD>Ten Incentives Widen Knowledge of Commandments</HD>
<DH>A retired florist is offering $10 to children who can
recite the Bible passage from memory. Nearly 7,000 have done so in
the last five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>George Kelley believes the nation has lost its moral conscience and
he plans to do something about it -- one child and $10 at a time.</LD>
<LD>   The 76-year-old retired flower shop owner runs a ministry out of
his home that pays children $10 each to memorize and recite the Ten
Commandments.</LD>
<LD>   With the help of donations, Kelley said, nearly 7,000 children
nationwide have been able to take advantage of the offer over the
last five years. He hopes to eventually persuade 10 million children
to participate.</LD>
<TE>   "When I say 10 million, you say that's crazy," Kelley said,
chuckling. "Well, if you have a small dream, nobody pays any
attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley's project was born out of disgust in 1997 after a part-time
cook killed seven workers at three Tennessee restaurants in a string
of killings that terrorized the Nashville area. Kelley saw the crimes
as one of many signs that young people did not understand right from
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   With help from friends, Kelley and his wife, Marion, started the
Ten Commandments Project. The Kelleys, both Presbyterians, felt
children who memorized the Ten Commandments might think about them
when tempted to lie or steal or get involved in other wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the Kelleys were concerned about how they would pay for
the effort, but supporters started sending donations -- from $15 to
$10,000 -- and a wealthy friend promised to help.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out, when our bank account got a little low, somebody
would send some money in," George Kelley said.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the $10, children must be 16 or younger, live in
the United States and recite the commandments to a pastor, rabbi,
priest, teacher or other authorized adult witness. The witness must
sign an affidavit, which can be downloaded from the ministry's Web
site tencommandmentsproject.org,  pledging that they heard the
child's recitation.</TE>
<TE>   "An authorized witness is not a relative," Kelley said. "They
would be inclined to fudge a little."</TE>
<TE>   Marion Kelley said she and her husband have not been concerned
about fraud, partly because they write checks to individuals instead
of to groups of several children at a time. Fabricating affidavits
"would be a lot of trouble for just $10," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, adult leaders of youth groups whose members want to
participate often call the Kelleys first for permission to act as
authorized witnesses, providing more assurance that the affidavits
are real, Marion Kelley said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Runge, a Lutheran pastor in Houston, discovered the project
while surfing the Web. He took the idea to St. Mark Lutheran School
in Houston, where more than 100 students participated and earned
their money during the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ten Commandments are the basis of moral law for human beings,
regardless of what your perspective is," Runge said. "The more kids
that know them, the more they'll know how to live."</TE>
<TE>   The Kelleys concede that some children will participate simply for
the excitement have faith that the young people will remember the
lesson well after the money is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope someday that it won't be the $10 that's important, but
that they'll have God's word in their heart," Marion Kelley said.</TE>

<LD>Researchers at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children reported in the
January issue of Nature Genetics that they identified the gene that
causes Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a disorder occurring once in
50,000 births. Victims have a defect in the pancreas that causes
digestion difficulties, inadequate production of some white blood
cells, skeletal abnormalities and short stature.</LD>
<LD>   The team found two defective forms of a gene on chromosome 7 that
cause the disease.</LD>

<LD>Israeli researchers have grown functioning kidneys in mice, a feat
that could lead to the production of kidneys in humans, eliminating
the need for transplants. The team inserted specific stem cells
called "kidney precursor cells" from humans and pigs into mice.</LD>
<LD>   Both types of tissue grew into "perfect" kidneys the size of
normal mouse kidneys, the researchers reported in the January issue
of Nature Medicine. The kidneys produced urine and were sustained by
blood vessels.</LD>

<LD>A Johns Hopkins University archeological team exploring the Temple of
Mut in Egypt will post daily progress reports on the Internet for the
third year, allowing armchair Egyptologists to monitor their
expedition.</LD>
<LD>   The Web site is www.jhu.edu/~neareast/egypttoday.html. Pictures
from last year's expedition are on the site and updates will be
posted beginning around Thursday. The group's goal is to determine
what the temple was like between 1500 and 1200 BC.</LD>

<HD>Tumor Drug Seen Helping Battle Cancer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An experimental drug that cuts off a tumor's blood supply showed
promising results on patients with advanced colorectal cancer when
paired with chemotherapy in a UCLA study, it was announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "This study could give us a less toxic and a more effective weapon
in our growing arsenal of cancer therapies," said Dr. Fairooz
Kabbinavar of UCLA's Jonsson Cancer Center, lead author of the study.</LD>
<LD>   Because a tumor cannot grow bigger than a pinhead unless it gets
an independent blood supply, researchers believe that by keeping the
tumor from getting new blood they can kill it off. The process tumors
use to get an independent blood supply is called angiogenesis.</LD>
<TE>   By giving patients the angiogenesis inhibitor Avastin and also
giving them two chemotherapy drugs, researchers hoped to see the two
treatment methods work better by complementing each other, according
to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The study involved 104 patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
Among those who received both types of drugs, drug treatment was more
effective in shrinking tumors and patients lived longer and went
longer without their cancer growing again after treatment.</TE>

<LD>If you got a new telescope over the holidays, there is plenty to see
in the night sky in the coming week.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the moon, one of the first objects fledgling
astronomers try to view, is a waning crescent in the predawn sky and
won't return to the evening sky until Jan. 4. But Saturn and Jupiter
are readily visible.</LD>
<LD>   You can see Saturn as soon as it gets dark by facing east and
looking for a dominant "star" about 20 degrees above the eastern
horizon. Saturn is especially bright now, outshining all the stars in
that part of the sky because of three geometric effects: The planet
is near the closest point to the sun in its 29-year orbit, Earth and
Saturn are particularly close together (only 750 million miles apart)
and the planet is tipped toward us at its maximum angle, showing its
rings to their fullest extent.</LD>
<TE>   Jupiter is now about five times brighter than Saturn, and it will
climb above the east-northeast horizon a little later in the evening.
With a 100-power telescope, you should be able to make out the dusky
bands girdling Jupiter's midsection. With a more powerful scope, you
should be able to make out the great red spot, which has been pale in
recent years.</TE>
